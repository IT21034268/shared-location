2,"Difficult to put together, lots of small pieces",Hopefully you have more patience then I do... I'm almost two hours into the construction and not much progress. There are a lot of small pieces and the instructions are really not that great. I guess you get what you pay for.
4,cute changing table,"This changing table was incredibly cute and a nice size. It matched our existing crib and looked great with it. Our only complaint is that it was a little challenging to put together, lots of parts to it, but overall good for the price."
1,Buy with caution - Cannot anchor changing pads,"After spending several hours! assembling this, it turns out you cannot anchor a changing pad. Their customer service line responds that the French designers didn't design it that way and don't know of ANY changing pad that would anchor to it. Unless you want to change your baby on a pad that can slide right off, this is not for you."
1,worst product ever!!!,"My boyfriend and I have placed over 20 orders on Amazon and have never been half as disappointed as I am now.. The order took 18 days to arrive because of shipping issues. The shipper originally sent one that was damaged and returned to them(it was damaged at the warehouse and fed ex sent it back, the first table was never delivered).. I called Amazon and they told me they would overnight me another one.. instead they sent it 3 day.The directions are next to impossible to understand and we have put together numerous pieces of furniture. The product is all around cheap. I am incredibly disappointed with this product. the shipping was a nightmare and assembly was just as bad.We purchased a television stand from South Shore a couple years ago and had problems with them then. Parts were missing and damaged.. we called them to get replacement and they wouldn't help in any way."
4,safety issue with changing table,I gave this item to my daughter for her new baby. Ava is now 3 mos. old. In order to give an accurate functional evaluation I prefer a fit and funciton as well as assembly of the item. As I wrote in my first evaluation during assembly we placed clamps to take the wobble out. Fit and function. I have used this as a changing table and we have set it up so everything we need is readily available. Thank You. Beth Tesi
5,Inspirational and easy to read,"I met Nick Irons' parents, Connie and John, recently and picked up this book as a result. Nick uses his conquest of the Mississippi as a metaphor for any difficult task that one can set for himself or herself. Going well beyond the typical inspirational book, Swim Lessons brings depth and specificity to its mission. I highly recommend this book and I highly admire the Irons family."
4,"If our WHY is strong enough, the HOW will take care of itself.","I met Nick Irons and his mom, Connie, two and a half years ago in Chicago at an awards celebration after his book won an award. Having finally read Swim Lessons, I realize what extraordinary things we can accomplish if our reason WHY is strong enough. Oftentimes, a person presents a challenging idea, and people emphasize the impossibilities. Nick's WHY was strong, his father has Multiple Sclerosis and Nick wanted to raise awareness of and funds for MS research to find a cure. The HOW fell into place with the entire Irons family and volunteer crew members stepping forward along the way. If swimming 1550 miles down the Mississippi was not enough, Nick fulfilled another extraordinary feat--a 10,000 mile bike-ride around the United States. Nick, I hope you are writing another book about this journey. A worthy read and an inspirational holiday gift whether or not you are touched by MS."
4,The Cradle of Texas; History Stories,The book was copyrighted in 1937 and has many historical notes I have not found in any other publication about Texas.The book was received in condition as advertised.
4,great artist,I wanted the cd because whitney was a great artist a definite waste to have lost her at such an early age
2,Whitney Houston,I am not much for writing reviews let alone writing more then a few words and don't like it when forced to so the one song I wanted to hear wasn't even the original which turned me off.
5,Whitney Houston- Greatest Hits,"Very nice collection of the songs with her incredible voice, that would keep her fans pleased forever.So sad that some of our most talented, and gifted artists have passed on, due to the demons thathaunted them from within."
3,Case scratched and broken,"When someone writes a description as 'Like New', that's what is expected.Instead, received a broken and scratched cd case. Not Happy."
3,Merely Average...,"While certainly not as horrific as many teen novels, Bad Kitty still falls short. The main character, Jasmine, while seemingly interesting lacks depth. Her friends, though not in starring roles, are much easier to like. Jasmine's life is too manufactured and unrealistic. Her and her friends have seemingly limitless amounts of cash and little parental control(except for in the case of Jasmine's dad). Unrealistic events kept me from connecting with the characters and more often than not I didn't care if or how they got out of a ""sticky situation"" because it was inevitable that they would with Jasmine coming out as a hero. While at times funny, the laughs aren't worth reading the book a second time."
4,Bad Kitty Book Review,"I read the book Bad Kitty. This book is about a girl who goes on vacation with her new family. She gets caught up in a mystery, and won't rest until it is solved.My favorite part of this book is when the man character, Jasmine, gets all the secret notes in her hotel room. Jasmine isn't sure who is sending her these notes though. She wants to find the person that is behind them all though. This is my favorite part of the book because as I was reading, I was trying to figure out who was sending the notes as well. I was getting caught up in the book, which is what i like to happen. That is why it is my favorite part of he book.I would recomment this book. It has a very good mystery, with twists and turns around every corner. You get sucked into the book. There is a lot of suspence, and even when you think you know what will happen next, it changes and leaves you totally shocked. It was a really good book, and contaned a lot of action and drama."
4,Great Bedtime Story,"This is a nicely done children's book with beautiful illiustrations by Linne Cherry. The prose of Jane R. Howard has a sing-song cadence, and is related one sentence a page. Each page pictures the young girl narrator in a different place sleeping, and in each page she is being held by a cozy animal. The story, wording and cadence are condusive to a good night's rest and will be perfect to settle kids down for beddy-bye.J. Lyon LaydenThe Other Side of Yore"
5,Great portrayal of Millay!,"If reading poetry is a lost art in our society, then combining film images with poetry is an art which hadn't been invented or often attempted. But here, the poet's words speak and then are caressed with visuals. It seems effortless, almost as if there were no producers or directors or actors, but only Millay's own beautiful words and music and the sea. It made her come to life in a straightforward yet lyrical way, with a tapestry of images, music and sound effects.The Selected Poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay (Modern Library Classics)The Selected Poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay (Modern Library Classics)Savage Beauty: The Life of Edna St. Vincent Millay"
5,A must read for Engineers look to establish business,"A great and honest book about the founding and expending a high tech company. Many experience such the VC funding phase, and the trades and trade offs the company dealt with TRW are things that should be taught in business school. I think I understood a lot of about tech business, RFMD and particularly the RF/Microwave business I'm in from this book. (Also it's quite funny that some of the people mentioned in the book, I actually met during MTT-S; though at the time I don't really know who exactly they are)"
2,Flag not as shown in the display picture,"The flag was not as shown in the display picture. Yes, the material is good and the size is as stated, but it does not include the shield at the center. Why would you show something that you are not selling? I chose this item from the other flags that are hanging out there because it contained the shield of Bolivia, but the reason I chose it was not in the flag when I received it."
1,Wrong Flag,This was the wrong flag. The flag I got did not have the seal in the middle and the material and coloring was not good. I would like to return this flag and get another one.
5,A Winner,"This book is very helpful, easy to follow, and practical. It describes exactly how to secure a new job, no matter what your profession or trade. Excellent examples illustrate each step, as well as succinct tips in easy to spot boxes. The SNAPP method clearly can be applied to the job continuation process. Numerous checklists are included. Highly recommended."
5,Description,"""Some of the most talented legends of the '70s soul scene bring their repertoire to the live stage in this 2003 concert. Featured are the sultry songs of Patti Labelle and the memorable talents of groups like the Commodores and Harold Melvin's Blue Notes"""
4,Ok Not as Hype as his first or newest,This album was OK it is not him though. He was forced into making the gay songs on the album by promoters. He is coming soon with a new album called Now or Never that is off the chains. His first album is very good as well.
4,Well-written and Useful,Nevis' book is thorough look at how Gestalt principles affect organizational consulting. I have not been a student of Gestalt ideas and methods since graduate school in a former life. Nevertheless it provides very good handles and tools for helping organizations learn what they need and to learn ways of acting in the future on their own.
2,Disappointed,Organizational Consulting; A Gestalt Approach is very dry and not an easy read. While some concepts stand out as important in client relationships most of the book is too academic for practical use.
5,THIS IS HOT!!!!,"I just finished listening to the CD all the way through and am blown away (I'm listening again while I'm writing this!). It's the best dance compilation I've heard in years. I especially like ""The Devil Made Me Do It"" and ""Horny All The Time"" (It'll put a smile on your face and you wont be able to stop singing it !). The Norah Jones remix is great too. THE PERFECT SUMMER PARTY CD !!!! A+(...)"
1,Lack detailed explaination,"I saw such high ratings here, then bought one. I found this book often lacks detailed explaination and statement, which makes it difficult to clearly and smoothly understand. Unlike some excellent textbooks by which you can easily make a progress every day, I often need to figure out by myself what here means, or why it is like that. Now I use other textbooks, and feel far better."
5,Six star on all pny product,I am a pny geforce friend. I have been using pny geforce product since its geforce 2 GTS to now geforce 7800 gtx with no problem at all.those people gave negative review are fake and worked for ATI.. believe me.. they tried to put negative reviews on every pny products in amazon. do not trust and ignore those reviews.
4,End of Days for AGP,I purchased this card to squeeze a little life out of this PC. Drivers for AGP~8 for Win-7 are only supported with neVidia's mid to top of line AGP boards. when I updated form XP to Win`7 and only because I installed a new solid state hard drive and the install went wrong. my old AGP that was just fine was now crap do to no supported drivers. This Video card did not have a cooling fan like my last so I modified it with one and have had no crash or reboot problems as reported by others left feed back. In summery I'll be listing all the parts in this PC whenever I upgrade to Win`8 and rebuild it for a project. .
1,"PNY ""lifetime warranty"" worthless","PNY's lifetime warranty is a joke. PNY claims that their warranty for a product is only valid as long as they are still manufacturing it. So, in theory, they could change revision numbers every month and then claim that a defective product is no longer covered under warranty. Some attorney general needs to investigate this company's business practices."
4,Good bump for the buck,"I said bump, because at this pricepoint, for a two-way speaker, you can't expect a Bang or a Boom. I had these installed in a previous car for a couple years before I junked it, now I'm building them into a box for my shop. I had these pared to a simple cross-over so these would run mid- and high-range in the front doors, while I had to low-range going to two 6 1/2"" woofers. They gave me crystal clear vocals, sharp snares and cymbal sounds and guitars like they were in the car. I can't speak to their bass performance, but I can say I was always pleased with their performance as the upper 2/3 of my car system."
5,"Terrific, down-to-earth advice!","If your grandparents didn't tell you their tips, it's not too late. These household hints are really helpful. Reading about them is like finding a treasure trove of information buried in the yard. It's amazing that so many items found in the house can be so useful in terms of cleaning, beauty, fighting nasty bugs, and more. The color photos help make this book a real, old-fashioned delight!"
1,Absolute Garbage,"My HP Pavilion a1210n allegedly has an HP DVD Writer 740b, and I've updated it with the latest firmware, which allegedly recognizes all sorts of 16 speed media.Despite this, the drive is unable to even recognize these Memorex 16x DVD-R discs. I hope the store where I bought these will take them back, because they are absolutely worthless to me."
1,DO NOT BUY THESE,We usually use the 50 pack of these and have never had a problem with bad disks. Thought it was a good idea to get the bigger package... WRONG. Not one good disk in the pack. Very disappointed
1,Very Disappointing,"I purchased 4 spindles hoping for the best but was disappointed right from the start. Due to very lax packing on Amazon's part, one of the spindles was completely broken, bits of it floating in the box. The disks were still on the spindle and, thanks to the little foam circles at the top and the clear plastic disk at the bottom, the disks themselves appeared to be undamaged. I tried to burn 11 disks selected at random from the entire spindle and only 5 wrote. And at least 2 of those had verification errors. I packed them all up, including the remaining disks from the broken pack, and sent them back.These were about $.09 cheaper per disk than the others I'd been buying from Uline, but when more than half don't write, it's no longer a bargain. I'll stick with my Uline DVDs from now on."
1,Plenty of Coasters,"I have used Memorex brand blank dvds in the past and out of a 50pack maybe 1 or 2 were bad. I have had very good results with the dvds. I bought an 100 pack with about 45 left, there have been 22 bad disc or will not play discs so far. I will not buy this brand again and just stick with Verbatim from now on."
3,Had at least 10 bad discs in the bunch,"Kind of a pain when you have to restart everything over and over again. We know for sure it was the DVDs being bad because we would try it again with another blank and it would record fine. I know you kind of tend to expect some of them to be bad, but I felt this was a little excessive."
1,Memorex has just changed the product - POOR QUALITY,"**PLEASE READ** Memorex has changed the product and packaging. I have purchased these for several years and been very happy. At first I thought I ordered these from that online auction site and received fakes. The packaging is so flimsy that it tore open during shipping. It looks completely different than than photo prsented by Amazon (the old packaging). See the photo I just uploaded! The disks feel so thin, they are more like one-time-use disposable DVD's than replayable quality DVDs. These disks are garbage.Update 7/18/09:4 of the first 10 disks are not readable by my brand new hp desktop dvd-recorder. It reads, ""please insert correct recordable media""...etc., this is a 40% failure rate so far. I'm just throwing them in the trash each time I get that message. What a waste of money - save yours and buy a different brand."
4,Good but not great,"I have not used these dvd's for data storage so my opinion is limited to home movies. Their have been no coasters, nor have I had any problems viewing these movies on my computer which burned them. However, when viewed on my older generation Sony dvd player there is occasional pixelation or green blocks. I have not been able to test the discs on any newer player so I hope its just me."
4,"Wow, a movie in just a few minutes...","Of course I had to upgrade the firmware on my DVD-ROM as well as upgrade the software I was using. But that only took a few minutes. All you need to do is google your DVD-ROM model for firmware updates. Then make sure the software you use to burn supports 16X. When my friends give me their 2.4X disks, I just chuck 'em and replace them with 16X. If you find yourself in a hurry to burn something fast, I recommend these. At 35 cents a piece, it's worth it (This 100pk was on sale for $34.99 right before Christmas 2005)."
4,These DVD-R's get the job done,No issues so far burning these at 8x on dual Panasonic BDR drives using Windows 7 & Nero. I would buy again as long as the price is right.
3,TDK is better for me,"I had some problems with Memorex. Quite a few of the disks were damaged, maybe in production. I like TDK better."
2,The days of Memorex being good is a thing of the past,"The days of Memorex being good is a thing of the past. I can't believe that Memorex has dropped the ball on their recordable DVD'S. My last several purchases have been, to say the least, TERRIBLE!There where many disc that were damaged and unusable. You may want to shop around unless you have money to burn!"
1,Good for coffee coasters only,These DVDs burn at 4x on a brand new Dell. So purchase at your own risk understanding that there is good chance your burner/firmware will not support the purported 16x write speeds.
3,Disappointed,I was really disappointed with the dvds. Some of them work but some of them don't work...I would not recommend buying this many dvd's.
2,Did the apple fall far from the tree?,"I just started using these discs & the very 1st was defective causing me to lose a lot of data, the second was fine but all the same will there be more defective discs? Were the 1/100 odds just against me or does that 1st defective tell the tale of this product?"
4,Fine DVD-Rs if they work with your drive,"I bought a spindle of these discs a couple of years ago. When I got them, I was disappointed that the DVD burner in my MacBook Pro was unable to write to the discs. I tried them on the computer in my office and they were able to burn without a problem. After a year and a few OS/firmware upgrades, I tried the discs again on my MacBook Pro. This time they worked just fine.I haven't experienced any of the quality issues that other reviewers have mentioned. When my burner has been able to recognize the discs, they have burnt with very few (if any) issues. I would recommend perhaps trying a smaller package if you've never used this brand before, as your individual drive may not be able to use these."
4,a home DVD recorder's review,"i ordered these 2 december '05, and use them with my panasonic DMR-E80H component DVD recorder to burn TV shows i record. my recorder is two years old, and these discs have worked fine in it without upgrading the firmware. i have had good luck with memorex media for this use for as long as i've owned my recorder; each spindle usually has a couple of duds in it, but for the price it's still a good deal."
5,Work great with Mac Superdrive,"I've burnt about 70 of these on my Apple 8x DL SuperDrive.Apple iMac Desktop with 20"" Display MA589LL/A (2.16 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 1 GB RAM, 250 GB Hard Drive, SuperDrive)Maybe 1 coaster, might have been my copy."
3,16 = 4,"I have a 16x dvd burner which came with my Gateway computer purchased earlier this year (February 2005). When it comes to finding media, there aren't a lot of 16x dvd-r's out there to buy. I've found a few, which all worked swimmingly. I spotted this new Memorex version of 16x dvd-r's at Best Buy a couple of weeks ago. After I got them home, I found out they only burn at a measly 4x... not even 8x... on my 16x burner.I'll try to find a firmware update to see if that helps. But come on, my Compu is less than a year old. Media should be more compatible than that. In ye olden days, when I bought cassettes, I didn't have to worry whether I had the very latest version cassette recorder to get them to work.Compatibility issues should be listed on the media, especially on items which are being purchased in bulk. They're sold as dvd-r's, not as ""might be a dvd-r / might be your new set of coasters / a surprise in every box"". If a firmware upgrade doesn't work, I'll try taking these back to the store."
1,Verbatim is better,If you have money to throw away then Memorex is for you. For reliability use Verbatim.
1,Two Thumbs Down,Well this was the first time I have ordered this product and will never do so again. Their where to many damaged discs reported by my software. Look elsewhere for another brand.
2,DVD-R set,"Received the DVD set in an unwrapped open box. the plastic cover was removed and the spindle already open when I received it. DVD's burn fine, but was quite disapopinted with the condition."
1,I do not recommend this company for failing to take responsibility for the product they sell,all are scratched dvd and dvd box of broken I wrote to you but I never answered is very bad service leaves the company making phenomenon so I do not recommend the mreposicion memandaron even the dvd
2,So Frustating,"More than half of the discs failed to burn when the dual layer was engaged. They work great if the setting is on single layer...so what's the use of buying these Ritek manufactured discs? Don't let the cheap cost of a large spindle fool you...because you'll better buying the single layer discs. In contrast, I've never had rejections from the more expensive Verbatim brand."
5,Suite me fine,"The first review here is asinine, he rated the product poorly not because its a poor product.I've bought these before and I'm buying them again. They've worked flawlessly on my 16x NEC-3540a for DVD-Video media [for distribution of my 2-yr olds antics] and for backing up data.This product would have 4-5 stars if not for the first guys stupid review from last year."
5,"excellent price, no kidding","excellent product for my DVD backup,Its price cannot be beatedno kidding."
2,About half were flawed,"About half of the disks on the spindle have a flaw around the outer edge--it looks like a circular scratch. It isn't a huge problem because I look for the scratches and only use those disks if I don't need all the space on them, but they shouldn't be there. I won't be buying this brand again."
1,Do NOT Buy,Memorex 16X DVD-R (100-Pack Spindle)70% of Discs were scratched. I just realized the Memorex discs are made by Memtek not Memorex ($30 version). So pay $30 and try the name brand or pay $20 and get a 50 pack of high quality Sony discs at a retail store (haven't checked Amazon).
1,product return,product did not work in my system so had to be returned.thank you amazon for the first class way you handeled the return.
1,Why me. Oh why me?!,Well I'll tell you this. I ordered these Blank DVD's and you just wouldn't believe what I got in the mail. BLANK DVD's. Simply unbelievable. I tried contacting the seller but they told me that no matter what I do or how I complain they're still gonna be blank. Simply blankening. What a blank. The seller talked to me as if I was some kind of a blank. BLANK!!!
4,Not Lightscribe Compatible...,"I got this spindle thinking they are light scribe enable, but they are not... I need another couple of words in order to get this published. Woo hoo, yiippee"
1,Avoid Memorex DVDs,"I'm in the process of recording many of my VHS tapes into DVDs. Recently I bought a 100-spindle pack of Memorex DVDs. If you want to become familiar with the ""burning process failed"" or other similar message [even at reduced recording speeds], these are the ones to buy. About 1 out of 4 fail & end up as coasters. I've not had poor results with TDK, Verbatim, or Maxell; an expert pal of mine said Fuji is the best he's used and that Verbatim is starting to get quality problems from some of its outsourced manufacturers [in the UAE, for example]. Pay the extra 2 or 3 cents per DVD and get quality - NOT Memorex."
2,Most coasters I ever had from a dvd/cd spindle!,Cons:1. Average of 1 coaster per 3 dvds burned.2. Had to buy a NEW drive just to get this to work. It wouldn't work on my two year old DVD-RW drive. (Wanted to buy one anyway)Pros:1. Most of the DVDs work I guess.Other Thoughts:I bought DYNEX DVD+Rs (8x) that worked with my old drive and NEVER had a coaster on my 50x DVD spindle.
2,Memorex 16X DVD-R 100-Pack Spindle,"About half of these disks could not be read to burn information onto. So, I have paid for an entire spindle and can only use about half."
4,Great Price,These DVD-R's were a great price. I couldn't find them anywhere else for the price I paid for them. The product was shipped and received in good shape.
5,Memorex DVD-R,I have tried many brands of dvd's and have found that the memorex DVD-R's are the most reliable for quality burns. And by ordering through amazon I got them at a good price and didn't have to search for stores with Dvd's on sale
2,This book isn't really worth buying.,"This book looks a lot better than it actually is. I found little new information, there certainly isn't anything in this book that the better ones in the genre doesn't contain. Also the tone and level of advice in the book reeks of amateurism.Instead read for instance the aid climbing chapter in ""Mountaineering the Freedom of the Hills"" or ""Big Walls (How to Rock Climb Series),"" by John Long and John Middendorf, round that up with perhaps the best one in the field ""Climbing Big Walls,"" by Mike Strassman and you will be much better off."
1,not worth 1 dollar,"This book never touches on aid climbing it says half of what John Long says in his ""How to rock climb"" series, but not nearly as well."
3,good but not enough,"This book belong to good german teaching tradition, but fallsbelow Golstein standard.It is a good text for the exercisesbut do not expect deep explanation for generatrix function,Hamilton Jacobi resolution methods and Poisson bracketsrelaion to differential geomery"
3,"Useful, but not written very well.","The book is useful, and it was badly needed when it was first published, but it was not written very well. For every paragraph of substantial or useful information, there is a page of repetition and imprecise fluff-- the book would have been twice as good had it been half as long. Again, the book is good and will not be a waste of money, but there are other pilot communication books out now that deserve a closer look. Don't assume that this book is better simply because it is longer."
2,Wordy,Ask this author what time it is and he will build a watch. Why use one example to get a point across when six more will do just as well?
3,Excellent for a beginner,I recommend it for a student pilot. It has all the basic information. I like it and learned few things. however if you are an experienced pilot I don't recommend it for you.
5,Informative easy to understand,contains all you need to know about aviation communication easy to understand and retain.
2,dangerous and useful at one and the same time,"This text was one of my texts at Seminary (I'm studying to be a pastor) and I was at first in love with this book. It is a scathing indictment of the Western (especially United States-ian) Church. It is an encouragement to see how the Christian faith is not politically bound to a nation-state, but rather much more universal in its applicability. In that sense this book in invaluable. However, the dangerous part of the book comes in the very definition that Jenkins uses for Christianity. What he defines as ""Christianity"" is not Christianity at all, but rather a philosophy which incorporates some Christian values. In an era in which Universalism is rampant, this definition is dangerous to the orthodox Christian faith. Be that as it may, it is a useful book if thought about critically."
4,observant but not complete,"Jenkins points out demographic and sociological trends in Christianity that, sadly enough, do need to be brought to light for many North American Christians. He provides good back up and a thorough layout. What is most lacking in his book, from a Christian perspective, is that he posits the issue as one where Truth follows consensus as opposed to consensus following Truth. The thing that Christianity must be careful of, that Jenkins does little to warn against, is to believe that strength in numbers makes things right or true, leading too often to force. Instead, we ought to be sensitive to where consensus lies and give it much credence, without making the Truth of God something subject to democratic vote."
3,Samson and Delilah (1949),Bought this movie from biblemovies.com and found that the sound quality was very poor and the color quality compared to a copied version on VHS was not up to par. But when I purchased my new plasma HD TV and Sony PS3 system I loaded this DVD in and the results were outstanding. I found out that the PS3 can upconvert regular and even poor DVD quality to great color and sound. The image sharpness was not equal to a digitally remastered movie but the movie went back up on my best DVD movie collection. As long as it's played on PS3. I still want Paramount to give this movie an upgrade to the DVD format. I would buy it for what ever the price. I'm going online to Paramount.com and try to get an answer.
2,Paramount release much inferior to Boying release from China,"I've had the Paramount release of this epic for a couple of years now, and was rather disappointed at the pale colors and overall sort of blurry rendition.When I was given a new imported release from the Boying company, it was everything the Paramount release should have been. Brilliant color, clear picture, and with bright white, good size subtitles, very easy to read.It is a great pleasure for me to be able to enjoy this spectacular movie in all its spendor. I only wish it were wide screen (it is Full Screen), but I'm happy to be able to see it as it was made to be seen."
5,great book for young girls,"I first read this book when I was about ten years old. I loved it. It was one of my favorites and I would check it out of the library all the time. It is about a girl named Lauren who is an eleven year old gymnast, along with her friends. They all work out at a gym and have a hunky coach named Patrick, whom Lauren has a crush on. Lauren is dealing with several things in this book. She is helping her mother campaign for mayor, and she is helping her friends at the gym deal with their rival Becky. Lauren and her friends decide to campaign for her mother by making a commercial where they get to do gymnastics, but Becky tries to horn in on them, and nothing goes the way Lauren plans. She is afraid that Patrick doesn't like her and everyone is mad at her, so she runs away temporarily, but it all works out in the end, of course. This is the ninth in The Gymnasts series, so there are other books involving all of Lauren's friends and herself. But this one is my favorite!"
5,Classic from the '90s,"This is one of the great new-trad country discs. I still remember when Mark's first song ""Too Cold At Home"" played on the radio. It sounded like an old classic. He followed it up with one excellent single after another from ""Brother Jukebox"" to ""Broken Promise Land."" They're all here along with his version of ""Friends In Low Places,"" recorded around the same time as Garth's. Chesnutt does not imitate Jones--the way Sammy Kershaw does--but he captures the same feeling."
4,too cold at home,this being his first album i think thats its great and its the songs like brother jukebox which is a great song and blame it on texas dont blame it on me it also has friends in low places so you hsould give a listen to marks version of the song
3,This game is COOL!,"This game is cool!I have it and I am really good at it.It's when Link gets warped to a differnent land called Holodrum.This person called Din(as in ""Din's Fire""!)wanted to meet Link very much.She saw a red light in the forest and saw Link was lying there.There is also somebody called Impa.She is the group's cook.Din is diguised as a dancer,but is actually the Oracle of Seasons.Then,after Link and Din dance,Onox,General of Darkness,KIDNAPS DIN!It is Link's job to save Din.Onox says that if he kidnaps Din,he will have control of the seasons.Use the Rod of Seasons to take control of the seasons.But,you must get your Rod of Seasons enchanted by the Season Spirits at the temple of seasons before you can change the seasons.The monsters are also tough.To me Zelda Oracle of seasons is hard,easy,cool,challenging, and scary.The bosses are tough."
2,Winds of Change have blown through Seasons,"This game, I must give respect to it for such a daring risk with the 2 game paks ages/seasons, but it just doesn't live up. I would much rather prefer Link's Awakening other than this. The game seems to rushed. I played this game for 1.5 weeks and I was 3/4's done. It just seems to rushed, it's confusing, there is nothing that separates this game from any other zelda game (I often forget whether I'm playing Season or Link to the Past[yet Link to the Past is an A+ game]). This game is trying to be too much like Ocarina of Time, what with the oracle that makes massive changes to the game, as does the ocarina, and this aspect isn't found in anyother hand-held Zelda game other than A Link to The Past (but don't forget, that is a port from SNES). All in all, if you are looking for a quick fix of Zelda.... go ahead and buy it, but I can't gaurantee you will be satisfied with it."
3,Great game!,"I love the game and the cartridge was cool, though I was kind of disappointed at the box when I bought it. Either way my sister loved it as a gift."
5,Very good,This game was fun and great to play and it is one of the best games that I have ever played.
5,A Truly Amazing Game,"I own both Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Zelda Oracle Of Ages. Both of these games Are truly amazing. I found Seasons to be a bit more challenging than Ages. If you are a first time Zelda player I would reccommend getting Ages and if you like it then get Seasons. I am on the final boss of Ages and it only took me 5 days to get to that point. But take into consideration that once I get a new game (especially a Zelda game) I play it non stop. So if you are looking for a more complicated, battle packed Zelda game then this one is for you."
5,Legend of Zelda Rocks!!!!,"This game is amazing! I spent every day waking up to go play. Once you beat the first game the second game is the best. Many people think that the two games of Legend of Zelda:Oracle of Seasons and Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages are the same like Pokemon Gold and Silver. But there two different games in reality. But be prepared to have a lot of frustration. I reccomend that you buy a guide book unless you want to spend a year of your life playing. If you are playing Pokemon right now, forget it. Pokemon will never measure up to Legend of Zelda."
4,Buy this one,"Even though GB Advance is getting ready to drop, I would strongly recommend getting this Zelda game right now. This is one you will be playing on the Advance no matter what games they release on that system.Oracle of Seasons is the type of game that Nintendo does best---more of the fun stuff. I found myself wrapped up in this game within minutes of turning on the gameboy.There are new characters, dungeons, items, etc etc. Go ahead, pick this one up."
5,this game is DA BOMB,this game rocks I really haven't played the game yet but I found a review on itit sounds great. I pre-ordered it and when I get it I'll write a more helpful reviw because I will probably finish it in a week
2,ARRGGH,"i just got my gameboy color used off ebay and it is in perfect condition. so then i got some gameboy color games off the interent, including super mario bros deluxe, donkey kong country, and zelda oracle of seasons.i really like smbd but as a first time owner of any video game thingy ( i've never had a gameboy, or a nintendo or a playstation or an xbox) i really didn't like zelda. although i read the instruction manuel many times i still couldn't quite understand!!! how do you put rings on??? and how do you fight creatures (i couldn't fight the creatures that you approach that come in the first 15 min of the game!!!) I COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT! sooo if anyone wants to tell me how to do any of those things please do! (except for the fact that i didn't really give you a way to contact me) hahaha)"
3,ok,I havent played many zelda games but this is the worst i loved windwaker but this is to hard i cant get far in the 4 dungeon with out being killed. in addition theres not much of a story just buy windwaker with the money u save :)
1,BORRRRING!,"this game is so BORING! you play at first and love it but then you get real bored cuz you get stuck at dungeon 3 cuz it makes you deal with this boss who kills you in one big blast so i put that game in my ""rejected games""box. this game SUCKS!!! it is a waste of money and time DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!"
5,"A 5 star review, well what do you think?","This is a wonderful game. If you have ever played any of the other games you'll love this one. It has an amazing plot. But its not one of those really easy games. I ADVISE you to get one of the Nitendo Power books that show you from a birds eye view the landscape, secret passages, hidden items, what to do, and so forth. After you beat this one save any passwords and buy Oracle of Ages. A simular game only different changes. Any of the Zelda games are wonderful."
5,Is There No End To Nintendos Genius,"Oracle Of Seasons is one of the best games to grace the gameboy ever. Along your journey you are helped by a few friends like Ricky the kangaroo, Moosh the winged bear and Dimitri the dodongo, who all will help you in different ways. This Zelda is more enjoyable as they have put more details into the dungeons and maps, and created a hug arsenal of weapons and gadgets for us to use. This is a must have for any Zelda fan who will be aching to play this game."
4,What a Great Idea! : The Key Steps Creative People Take.,"Even thought this book was written in 1992 it still has ideas that can be useful to people in business today. A quote that I found to be very good is this, ""Find and hang a picture of your vision on your wall. NASA has lots of pictures of space stations and the moon."""
5,Think Creatively Outside the Box!,"I recently heard Charles ""Chic"" Thompson at a leadership seminar and picked up a copy of this book. This book is full of great ideas/methods to help you think creatively and outside the box. He covers overcoming assumptions- big idea killer and moves on to expression and questioning of ideas - which begins to shape new ideas. The fredom to cultivate creatively is a step that transcends linear thinking. It removes the blinders of assumptions to allow organizations to idea map forward. Taking action is the next step. This is where the process of creativity meets the various organizational stages like sales, marketing, distribution, etc. Prior to reading this book I thought - as the leadership world teaches, creativity was 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. Now I realize that I should be inspired to think creatively and I will perspire less! If you want to learn how to think act, plan creatively - buy this book - It really is inspiring!"
1,Another Unhappy Customer,"Double Beware!! I am also a legal owner of version 3.1. I bought version 5.0 upgrade. Nowhere in the box can you find a warning saying that if you have version 3.0 or 3.1, the program will not install. I feel taken, robbed. I will never buy an ADOBE program again. I bought the program when I visited the US last month. I give the program 1 star for the simple reason that I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO INSTALL IT. I bought version 3.1, 5 years ago. Am I supposed to keep the receipts?"
1,LESS Functionality isn't worth the money,"Although pdf files are very useful in digitizing paper materials, the fact that Adobe crippled its 5.0 version of its Paper Capture (OCR, text recognition) functionality is shameful. When I purchase an upgrade, I expect BETTER functionality, not worse. With 5.0, you can only capture 50 pages of a document - if its longer than 50 pages, you must purchase the Adobe Capture product. With the previous version (4.0x), there was NO limit to the number of pages and no need to waste more money. Do NOT buy this product - go to Ebay and buy somebody's 4.0 version for cheap. (Note: the 4.0 version of paper capture does NOT work with Windows XP and no bug fix is provided so you are screwed if you have XP)."
3,The problem with Acrobat 5,When Acrobat 4 was upgraded to 4.05 Adobe included a very useful OCR facility within the program for use with your own scanner. In Acrobat 5 this has been radically altered. You are now required to send your scan to a remote OCR facility on an Adobe web site for which only a limited number of document captures are free. Therafter you must pay a subcsription fee. So think carefully before changing to version 5.
2,"Exceptionally long save time, cant remove from drive...",The save time on the typical sheet I was scanning and then saving thru distiller 4.0 jumped from 1 or 2 seconds to 16 seconds in distiller 5.0... making the program obsolete for serious scanning projects. After removing the program from the harddrive using program removal from windows it now gives fatal errors and locks up the computer. Will have to re-format the hard drive now to clear the problems... Adobe does it again.
1,Dissapointed,We purchased this product from Amazon.com and the listing ID # is 0911L079611. We attempted to purchase Simply 3D version 3.0 and was sent Version 2.0We have had no success in reaching the seller... We are really saddned and dissapointed in these results
2,Not too impressed,"Simply 3D 3.0 is decent for simple text or Very simple object rendering and animation. Rendering is good, but the animation engine kinda sucks. It claims to support importing of *.dxf files, but it doesn't import well, if at all. I do use it to create 3D animated text for web developement, but if you want more out of it, try spending a little more money on professional software."
3,Not what I expected.....,"Was expecting a larger diameter mirror - was very disappointed to receive a small 3"" mirror - returned it. Nothing wrong w/mirror - just not what I needed."
5,HealthDri Ladies Washable cotton underwear,"As we get older it seems every time we cough, laugh or move the wrong way, we get the ""leaks"". These particular type of underpants are the greatest I have used. I had to use adult diapers for those days, and believe me my rear end looked like Daisy Duck in pants. These slenderize your tummy and they have inserts to protect even the hardest of ""gushes"". Try these and stop buying those nasty adult diapers."
2,Disappointed,"Although they are very comfortable, I found that just leaking a small amount went through the sides of the pad, they certainly will not hold as much as they claim. I wear them around the house, but would not dare wear them going somewhere. You can't return them and they cost a lot."
3,The Horror.....The Horror....,"If you have heard of this film and know of it's ""Golden Turkey"" reputation, well you have been warned. Lots of fun and essential for students of bad movies. The real shock of this Alpha Video release is that the picture quality is possibly the best I have ever seen of this film. Usually Alpha's quality is very spotty, but this is way above average. Especially for a film THIS bad."
3,So bad that it's almost good,"The two Martin and Lewis look alikes almost fool you at first, but the production values are non-existent, as is the script in this ""so bad that it's almost good"" flick. If you like Arch Hall Jr. or Cash Flagg movies, this might appeal to you."
3,Low Budget Fun Fest,"This film is not as bad as the title would make it seem.Duke Mitchell & Sammy Petrillo are the poor man's Martin and Lewis.Petrillo's ""humor"" makes Jerry Lewis appear understated in comparison and I'm sure Dino never felt threatened by Duke.Bela Lugosi turns in his usual credible mad scientist performance.Charlita plays the love interest and is smokin' HOT, scantily attired in her best South Sea togs.The video and audio quality are very good as was the print used for the transfer.Add another star if you're a diehard Lugosi fan."
2,Lugosi Shines in Z-Grade Artifact,"This 1952 ""horror-comedy"" finds Bela Lugosi with a pair of infamous Martin and Lewis imitators: Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo (remember them?). The result is a strange cultural artifact, yet perversely watchable. Lugosi makes the most of his limited footage as a traditional mad scientist. Directed by William ""One Shot"" Beaudine, who also helmed Bela's ""The Ape Man"" (1943). Jerry Lewis and producer Hal Wallis tried to stop the release of this Z-grade turkey, but it escaped anyway."
1,Sammy left his wife and 4 kids in 1969,"Sammy is often deemed a cult hero for his work in this film. While he is a funny man, he is far from being a hero. He left his wife and four small children in 1969. They came home to find that he had moved back to New York. He did at least leave them with a dollar. I know, I was 7 years old at the time. I'm one of the 4 sons he left. The oldest. Our last names are slightly different as he changed his to try to benefit from the current head of the musicians union at the time; who bore the last name Petrillo (same name as my brothers and I, new spelling)."
2,Cheap Imitation,"The reviewers who summarized this film as a cheap imitation of ""Martin and Lewis"" comedy are so accurate it's hard to believe. Imagine the audacity of being so obvious in copying other people's work! Such stereotyping! It's throughout the whole movie. The storyline is weak, the acting is predictable, even the resolution of the ""crisis"" is borrowed from other material.Sammy Petrillo is the goofball ""Jerry Lewis"" impersonator, while Duke Mitchell is the ""Dean Martin"" pretty boy who gets the girl. Dr. Zabor, played by Bela Lugosi is the ""evil"" ""mad scientist"" is loses in the end. The island chief's daughter is the cutiepie the hero and villan via for. Cliche, cliche, cliche. Yawn! Next!"
1,Oh how the mighty had fallen!,"When you see this insanity, you want to say ""Oh how the mighty have fallen"" when you see Bela Lugosi in this mess! What a comedown! Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis on welfare! Here, Lugosi is a mad scientist who turns the Dean Martin copycat into a gorilla so that he (Lugosi) could have the beautiful heroine all to himself. The faux Jerry Lewis does an extremely weak imitation of the ""master."" Folks, ths must be seen (if you can stomach it) to believed! This film is as outrageous as it's title and makes ""Gilligan's Island"" look like ""Gone With the Wind."" YUCK!"
3,Bela Lugosi Meets A Brooklyn Gorilla,"I just bought this DVD not too long ago (reluctantly) only because I am a HUGE Lugosi fan. So, to my great surprise, I thought the film was cute. Number one, I do not feel that Lugosi's role was a let down. I thought that he seemed to be having fun. Number two, Sammy and Duke do a good job, considering that they couldn't have been much older than me (which would be 21). And number three, I over all enjoyed the film. The references to Dracula seemed to amuse Lugosi, and they amused me as well. Try not to judge this film too harshly. I guess each one has his own opinion, so you must see it to make a formed, individual opinion about this film."
3,just a review,Well I happen to like this film. For thoes of you who know film very well it's kind of like the Lemmon Drop Kids by Ray Dennis Steckler (of Rat Fink and boo boo fame) here is a really silly comedy that by all means was a knock off film. but where Dean and Jerry had to not OVER due it in their films.Sammy and Duke are more or less a warner brothers cartoon send up of them. So they wend as silly and crazy as they could go in one film. I think that they had an energy that was missing from martin and Lewis. I will admit it is a dumb plot and will not go down in time as one of the greatest films ever made.But I definetly tell you to give it a chance.thanks for your timeMike
1,useless book,"i dont understand why authors like horowitz and rajasekharan,write books which they can only read themselves that too under extreme trauma.i know it may sound harsh, but all the students i have interacted absolutely hate this book,with good reasons too.too obcure langauge,little explanation of algorithm.if u read this book u will develop a hatred for algorithms.which is not good at all."
3,Excellent material &organization; poor pedagogy &motivation,"The heading says it all; this is a very comprehensive text, and well organized topic-wise, with good logical flow. But it gives a feeling of having been written in a hurry. Although not totally dry, it does not make for a motivational textbook. Examples are often left unexplained, when even a few lines of explanation would make it clear what's going on.DO BUY this book if: 1. You're taking a course in algorithms, have a good professor, and you need sufficient material in one source.2. You enjoy challenges in which the material HAS been COMPLETELY presented logically but you need to figure out what's going on.3. You can tolerate poor pedagogical methods as long as all the material is there in one place.DO NOT BUY this book if:1. You have not had much exposure to the subject, and you need a self-study kind of book.2. You do not have a motivational professor.3. You need a textbook to be ""engaging""."
1,Don't Waste Your Time with This Book,"The book is dull, dry, and cannot be regarded an educational text. It is also poorly written. The authors make no attempt to incorporate proven teaching methods. The authors seem clearly intent on portraying the material as being more difficult than it really is which will only serve to limit the ranks of individuals gaining expertise in the subject matter. The reader will find it difficult to understand the material in the fog created by the authors' pseudo-intellectualism and , in all liklihood, will have trouble understanding concepts which, if portrayed in the proper context, would have been relatively simple. Steer clear from this text. There are much better textbooks on the market in this subject area. Not only does the book fail to teach, it will sour your stomach for Algorithms."
2,No online corrections/list of errors?,"One of the first examples in the book, priming you to analyze the time complexity of random algorithms, goes on to conclude that the probability of rolling 2 6-sided dice whose faces add to ten is 9/36, or 1/4.Of course, that doesn't make sense and all the examples are bad at explaining how they come to conclusions. Since I can't find any online corrections of errors in the book, I'm already lost, not knowing if I just don't understand or if they just got it wrong.It would also have been nice if they put in the fairly standard ""solutions to every other problem"" in the back of the book, or at least offered (at an extra cost, of course) a solution guide."
5,I love DXing,"Better then the reviews, blows away my Yacht Boy, designed by Drake and built by Tandy for Grundig USA. No complaints, need to spend three times as much for anything better and they aren't portable."
3,very good radio,Your a fool if you pay over 400.00 for a used one. They sell all day on ebay between 325 and 400 dollars. Someones on some serious mushrooms pricing it USED at 685.00. Not even a sucker would bite on that.
2,Poor,It cuts but this is not a close shave. You can scrub and scrub to get a good one or supplement it with a regular razer. Your choice!
3,ok not good as original but not bad either,ok not good as original but not bad either DOes not seem to shave quiet as close as original but really not bad for $13
5,hanging lantern sterling silver tall cylinder poison box jar pendant,"i take one pill a day for medical reasons and this was the perfect item for me. whether man, woman or child this is a universal piece of jewelry. it has a nice weight too. i also ordered the 30"" bead chain which is also excellent. this is just what you are looking for if you like sterling silver & do not want to take up room in your pocket with a pill box for one pill and so you dont forget to take your medicine."
1,Bad Choice!!!,"This is the worst piece of equipment I have ever purchased, it's so bad I had to return it, it came difective. This is the second one I purchased, I purchased the first Cortex from another company and it also came difective. the mixer would start playing the songs then freeze up on me, I would have to unplug it to unfreeze it. I'm going to try the numark mixers from now on."
3,I guess is decent for the price,"The headphones' audio is not in time with the output audio, there{s a delay... Doesn{t read bpm, no looping...It{s a cool device just for playing music one song after another, but not really for mixing, the scratch mode is not reallistic, if you know how to cratch you'll find it hard to scratch with this one.. I give it 3 stars because of low pricing"
1,Looks good now...but give it a year!,Dresser a year old and is already a piece of junk. The drawers will not stay in the tracks. Tracks are cheap and plastic. VERY dissapointed.
1,Spend your money on something else,I bought this when looking for inexpensive dresser for my daughter. This is just plain cheap. I wish I'd gone to Target and got one of the inexpensive ones in the store for the same price or similar price.
4,Beautiful,"Bought this royal cherry drawer chest to match the cherry crib in our's unborn baby's room and it matched perfectly. It arrived in perfect condition and was very easy to assemble. Instead of using the enclosed drawer knobs, we bought some pink drawer knobs from Target and it made the drawer chest look even better. The only problem we had was the shipping because the item took well over 2 weeks to arrive and we were expected it in less than a week according to the shipping instructions. Other than that, we're happy with our purchase."
1,spend the extra money,"Whiose most likely to buy this set?? Young parents, likely on a budget. Who should buy this set? Craftsmen who don't mind spendng hours putting a chest together piece by piece. Then again- he or she could probably build their own chest from scratch in the amount of time its taking to make this chest functional for my 3 year old. I'm far from good with tools/my hands, but I put my daighters crib and changing table together in less than half the time it's taking with this thing. The instructions clearly have you put the drawer tracks on backwards- just a heads up!No exaggeration, it come in every single piece, even the individual drawers have to be built. I would not recommend this set for anyone who has anything to do on a weekend. However, if you are ready to spend a few beautiful spring days on the floor in your house, with a screwdriver, drill, and really bad instructions- this is for you!!"
2,Damaged,"Ordered the dresser from amazon, and the thing came demolished. 1/2 of the pieces had broken corners or large gouges in the dresser drawers. I contacted the company, and they were very easy to deal with as far as getting replacements. However, it took 2 weeks before I had all of the replacement pieces, which was a huge hassle for us. The replacement pieces came very well packaged and padded. They should use that kind of packaging from the start and I don't think I would have had this problem. I wouldn't purchase this kind of item from amazon again, however the dresser does look nice once I got it together."
4,Perfect for the price!,"We bought this dresser instead of buying a changing table. It's the perfect height and width for a changing pad and can still be used as a dresser once my daughter's out of diapers. We didn't want to get a changing table that would no longer serve a purpose later on. It's wood laminate, so it's kinda cheap and scratches easily, but the drawers glide easily and are roomy. We put my daughter's pj's, onsies, socks, and pants in this dresser. I'm very happy that we purchased this."
1,Don't buy this.,"The only good thing about his chest is how nice it looks, but otherwise it's cheap quality material. Just assemble the whole thing and put it at one place, don't move it around, otherwise what we have found is that the sides are moving apart and therefore drawers are falling down. Very annoying. I tried tightening the screws, it was OK for a couple of weeks and then again the same problem. I have another 3-drawer shelf from IKEA, which I bought at about half the price. We have been using it for 4 years and it is still rock solid."
1,Poor quality - pieces missing & parts scuffed,"After reading several of the reviews, I was more than ready to spend a couple of hours putting this dresser together. But what I wasn't expecting was to spend 1 1/2 hours putting it partially together only to find out there were missing screws/bolts and to see that two of the pieces had scuff marks & one already had the paint peeled off. If you order this piece, I would ensure you have all of the hardware and look each piece over closely. Also be aware that the drawers slide on plastic ""railings"" and not metal. I have purchased other put-together furniture and this is one of the poorest in quality."
5,Pleased,We've been using this dresser for about a year and a half and have been very pleased. The drawers slide open easily and it looks quality. It was a good purchase.
2,white chest,This product was beautiful once finish however it was very time consuming to put together we litteraly had to put every peice including the draws together and the back of the chest was cardboard which was very diappointing I expected press wood but not cardboard other than that it is okay. I would suggest it comes already together of at least halfway it took about 3 hours and it was not easy we even had to drill the holes because they were to small. I would suggest ordering a chest that is already put together and has a wood back.
4,Hard Construction,"Very cute and a lovely when finished, but took a lot of effort to put together for one person. I suggest a male doing the hard work. ;)"
4,Good value if you are willing to put in the effort,"With the right tools, this item should be easy to assemble. I am no handy person but I did all by myself even if it took me about 4 hours without the correct tools. Went to Home Depot to get a set of multi-tool screw driver for about $10 and came back to finish the rest in less than half an hour. With all the screws in proper place the dresser is quite solid and nice looking. I gave it a 4 stars because of the cardboard at the bottom drawers. I would recommend it to any one who is on budget and don't mind put in a few hours"
1,Don't waste your money,"This was very, very difficult to put together and the sliders are made of cheap plastic, the drawers would not stay in the sliders. It is a worthless piece of junk, and is now in the garbage can."
3,Cute but.....,"I got this for my son when I was pregnant, I was looking for free shipping and a low price that's why I chose it. It wasn't hard to assemble. But over the last few months I noticed that one drawer in particular does not stay on the tracks, I am disappointed about this!!! Maybe I messed up somehow when putting it together who knows but I am disappointed."
1,Do not buy!!,"Although the dresser looks nice, it is completely unusable. Every time a drawer is pulled out it come off the tracks and is very hard to put back onto the cheap plastic tracks. Definitely not worth paying $100 for this!"
1,WORST DRESSER EVER - DO NOT PURCHASE!!!,"This arrived quickly and was well packaged. The fun began after I opened it. NO INSTRUCTIONS! So I called Amazon, who directed me to South Shore customer service. After speaking with a lovely Indian man for 20 minutes, I finally had the instructions emailed to me. Assembly took 3 hours, and was very difficult. When I went to slide the drawers in, they don't slide in and out with putting serious muscle behind it. Sliders are plastic. It is made in China. Enough said."
2,Not exactly what i wanted.,"well i had originally pointed out a different dresser to my wife that wasn't composite but she unknowingly ordered the composite wood one instead. the gliders for the drawers are made of plastic so they feel kind of cheap. there's just this thick poster board like backing to it that was a turn off and it got nicked pretty bad in some areas, but thankfully it came with a stain pen to fill those marks and now you can't even tell. all in all i think it'll hold up for now, but i'm military and will eventually be moving again and i don't think i'm going to take the chance of shipping this because there's no way i'll take this apart again. it also took about 2 hours for assembly."
1,Very Cheap would not buy again stay away,"You know that really cheap book shelf you bought that when you touch it, it looks like it's going to fall over. Well this dresser is exactly like that only with drawers. The drawers are plastic on plastic glides and will probably loosen up and be easier to open about the time they break off. I bought another much nicer dresser for my other childs room for the same cost at a local department store. There is no knotch in the back panel of the drawers and bottom is held up only by nails. The question is not if it will break it's just what part first. The only sturdy thing is the knobs which appear to be solid wood. But I guess what do you expect for $100. The picture and fluffy name lead me to believe it was nicer than in reality. Item arrive 7 days after ordered. Good luck! :)"
3,Drawer,"Luckily my husband was the one who put this together because it took several hours. Once he got his power drill it was a lot easier, but very time consuming. It works great, but took a long time to assemble."
4,Who dun it with civil rights angle,This is a breakthrough who dun it. Black Tide does an excellent job using the drama of the racist Texas injustice system to deepen the intrigue of surrounding a murder the authorities want hushed up. Fear comes at the young black lawyer from every imaginable direction. I'd recommend this novel for use in any American history class focused on the '60s or the civil rights movement.
4,4 stars for Ja,"The reason I gave this dvd 4 stars not 5, was the lack of Ja Rule, In the end you want more Ja but all their is, is models. but otherwise Ja shows his crib, beautiful home, and he shows other things like his body(I wont go to what else he shows, it has something to do with cigars) and dont get me wrong I love Ja Im still supporting him. But just a little disappointed in this dvd, its like you want it to end its so boring."
1,Disappointed,"Yes, the camel is cute but the crystal ball completely turned me off. I was very disappointed in this Thomas Nelson DVD."
5,Yum,This is the best tasting protein shake that I have found on the market. The price is a little high.
3,"good music, so so script","I like the show becuse of the songs, but the teenage problems and the ""all for love"" theme is a bit overwhelming and tiresome.... but still like the show, I recommend to buy it, as it's entertaining and better than just sitting with the cd of music."
2,"Great Idea, Horrible Program","Well, I was very excited to try this program as my entire world is digital now. No filing cabinets. Anyway, the program works great as far as browsing PDF goes, etc, but getting them INTO the program is a nightmare. It's very clunky, you can't just moniter folders, etc. It's a great idea for a program that was designed by someone that obvoiusly doesn't deal with digital documents in bulk.Would I recommend? Yes, if it worked, but as it is, absolutely not."
4,Dr Froggy at your service,"All I have to say, this is the cutest toy that I have ever given as a gift. My friend's son was very sick and I sent it to him to cheer him up. Dr Froggy really did the trick! He fell in love with it and played with it the whole time. I always loved Manhattan Toys and I'm going to keep their toys on top of my list for gift ideas."
5,Great For a Big Brother or Sister expecting a little brother/sister,"My son is almost 3 and just got a little brother a few months ago and it is great! Feel better frog is just adorable sneezing when you hold the tissue to his nose and very polite, thanking you too! It really is a great idea (feeding etc...). You might be surprised how much they will mimic you!"
5,Good sound and sustain,"Crisp sound, good sustain. High quality product at a reasonable price. The cymbal has a good tin sound and looks nice.Very satisfied with these cymbals."
4,Wuhan...Woo Hoo!!!,"Professional drummer with 27 years playing. I've never been a fan of too many splashes but the Wuhan did not disappoint. I have it mounted on a stacker post and it performs well. Not too tinny and degrades quickly. With any splash you must have finesse, hit it like you slap your ham and you'll dent it."
4,"Great resource, but not comprehensive enough","If your planning on doing some hiking in the Southern rockies of Colorado this is a great resource.The author has listed some rxcellent hikes in different regions throughout the state. The hikes include complete descriptions and maps so that you can get a look at the area. In addition there are thorough descriptions of how to access the trailheads. Of course if you obtain a USFS or NPS map of the area you could find these trailheads without turn by turn descriptions.Another plus are the numerous sections describing local plant life, animal life, and historical places.The only problem I had is that it left out a lot of hikes in the areas it covers. I would highly recommend this book, I just wish there was more of it."
4,"Wonderful, sturdy chain that I wear daily.","This is a great chain!! Perfect size and length for me. I wear it every day, and I just swap out which pendants I wear on it. I've gone from putting pandora-style beads on it to wearing different sized sterling silver pendants. The 3mm size makes it sturdy enough that you don't have to worry about snapping it or having it kink on you.The only draw back that I have with it is having to polish it regularly. I like maintenance free things, but it is worth it for the price and how versitale it is.Nice compliment to any outfit!"
3,Good BIke... but not great,"I bought this bike about a month ago. The look and style is great. However, the seat is very uncomfortable, I had to get it replaced. Even worse, I have rode it a couple of times already, and the Front Derailleur is already damaged. I need to have this bike tuned up at the local bike shop which will set me back an additional $50.00. While I do expect for Schwinn to make good on the warranty, and send me a replacement part, it is a hassle to have to register, and wait for it. Unfortunately, I may need to come out of pocket even more if I want the part replaced sooner. Overall, this bike is okay, but I will recommend to do serious research before deciding on this one."
4,Nice Package,"This is a very good, inexpensive, all purpose bike. Great packaging. Fast shipment. Assembled in approximately 30 minutes (having had some experience). Brake adjustment took longer. No defects - everything fit perfectly. However, gear adjustment is necessary as all gears were not available out of the box. This is understandable as there are so many of them. Have not made that adjustment yet but expect no problems. This is a second bike - and is hooked up to my trainer - everything works fine."
2,Choose a Local Bike Shop,"When I had a problem with this bike, I called Schwinn directly. The customer service representative told me that she would not recommend buying a bike online and suggested using a local bike shop to avoid problems. I agree. I was completely satisfied with a reputable local business. Amazon accepted the bike in return, and I appreciated that.What I liked about this bike: aluminum frame, styling.The problems: the front tire was defective, the directions don't match the way the bike is packaged when you assemble it which caused confusion."
4,too new to review but beautiful,"I have not had enough time on the bike to rate the comfort long term as others have stated, but I love how it looks! Amazon had listed it for a bit less than I had paid, before I had even received the bike, and would not honor any price difference within a week, 30 days, etc. like some other store will, so be aware of that."
3,Decent Table,"I've had a pair of these for little less than a year, and they've worked OK so far. The digital readout is good for visually seeing the pitch, but the bpm counter and master tempo serve no function for an experienced DJ. The counter wont read the time of complex beats such as hip-hop or jungle. It will only help you if you are playing music with a strong 4 on the floor beat such as house or trance. Even then, it is only accurate to 1 percent, there is no decimal place; most beat matching requires a much higher accuracy. The master tempo allows you to change the speed without changing the pitch. However, if you adjust it more than 4%, the music will sound choppy like a low bit-rate mp3, which is horrible for live performance. Remember that on any turntable most songs will sound ok if they are within 4% of the original speed. There's lots of cool features, but remember, more features means more things to break."
5,Luxurious shampoo for color treated hair,"Someone recommended this product and I was thrilled to be able to purchase it conveniently through Amazon. Wonderfully rich, creamy lather and a gorgeous, clean scent. Leaves my hair in great condition. Love, love, love."
1,Ok shampoo,I used the entire bottle and saw no repair or improvement with me hair. Smells good but not a good choice for my hair.
1,Bad Experience,"I used it once and it changed the color of my highlights. I don'tknow what chemicals are in this product, but it is not good for highlighted hair."
3,Is it authentic?,"The authenticity of this book is questionable at best, but the book gives you further insight into some of ancient royal families of the Itza and post classic era thus the III star rating."
1,Not a good choice,"This book is turgid and poorly organized. The author seems knowledgeable but is evidently unable to achieve any kind of clarity in the subject matter of the book. If you can find an alternative to this book, go for it."
2,Book doesn't deliver what the title promises,"I wanted to read this to find out about the movings of the Holy Spirit in our time. What I read however, was a history of charismatic and Pentacostal missions over the past 75 years. While this was an interesting study, it was not written in a way that could be readily understood by non-charismatics; and it focused more on what the charismatic movement was doing in the world than on what the Holy Spirit was doing on a broader scope. The author claimed to want to discuss the Spirit's working in many traditions and denominations but all we got was a picture of what was happening with one particular group."
2,"Basic, with some lackluster information","This guide is overly simplistic, although it tries to be comprehensive. In an attempt to achieve the fulfillment of a unique niche, Keyte's book incorporates several topics which are only loosely connected, if at all, to the general direction of the work.It does, however, provide a large list of resources as an appendix, although it is limited to mostly the United Kingdom."
4,Good show...,"This is a great show. Exciting, eye opening. I really feel for these guys. They are good ole boys, but I could do without the cussing."
3,Bought for one song Basically,"Really only purchased for one song. But it is a great one. Overall , no not the best for the rest of them.But you do what you have to do...LOve progressive rock.My Grade = C, except the one song is A"
3,Looks Like it Could Be a Great Telescope --- But . . . . . .,"Dear Meade, Please fix your documentation - put it (the corrected version) on-line now (like tomorrow) for us frustrated users. Please Beta test your manual with some Chimps first. I'm going to stick it out trying to figure out how to operate this little beast - always liked a good challenge. It's optics and construction appear to be a big bang for the buck. It's like the engineers just got carried away with building the space shuttle, but can't explain to anyone how to fly it! Why don't you have a customer service e-mail address on your Web site? (Maybe you do, but I couldn't figure that out either, oh well. Hobbies are such fun!)"
2,Pedantic,"Cullen's book tries to examine the Civil War from different 20th century perspectives such as Carl Sandburg's Lincoln, the movies Gone with the Wind and Glory, 70's Rebel rock, & 90's battlefield reenactors. It's a yawn - a boring, politically correct, droning waste of some pretty decent research. Cullen writes badly and has no sense of humor. Tony Horowitz' Rebels in the Closet covers basically the same topic in a much more entertaining manner and is a much better read."
2,Insightful but extremely biased,"In analyzing popular culture's portrayals of the Civil War primarily from the persective of race, class and gender, as well as political ideologues, Cullen purposely gives the reader an incomplete picture of this unique analysis. How can Cullen write about GWTW (which he did insightfully) and not mention the portrayals of Sherman and his army or of the Confederate veterans returning home? Why did he choose for an in-depth interview, a female reenactor? Overall, it was an entertaining read if you understand that, as an academic historian, Cullen writes from the biased position of a 'new historian'."
5,Completely Over the Top,"Loved The Larry Carlton/Steve Lukather DVD.But sometimes, even with great artists, one DVD may still be enough to get the main idea of what they have to offer/say. Doesn't seem to be the case with Larry.This DVD is absolutely phenomenal. What a pairing. Who put these guys together? Perfect. Tak is one of the best guitarist you'll ever see. This is not Larry and an up and coming shredder. This guy has taste, touch and class. Tak is a phenom.Michael Rhode's bass playing is not to be missed. Great drumming and keyboard, John Ferraro & Billy Steinway.If you have some Larry Carlton, this is ""NOT"" more of the same.Great, great material....and new.Also, Larry's Saphire Blues Band DVD is not to be missed either. Larry and a four piece horn section. New material. Again, not more of the same. If I had to choose though, this DVD is tops. But don't choose.Please don't peg me as a Larry freak, I just love great concert DVDs."
4,"Good, but not great.","I'm not a great Richard lee Byers. I've found some of his other books difficult to read. But this one flowed better. And I enjoyed reading it.The villans are excellent characters as is Miri. The lead character Aeron and the book in general, seemed to lack a little something.And i'd like to see more stories about the villians or Miri. But not Aeron. Which possibly explains why I don't think the book is worth five stars.If your a forgotten realms fan. You should enjoy this book. Although don't let the rouges title, lead you into thinking the books about thieves . There was little stealing , just alot of sneaking, fighting and double dealing."
4,Adventurous misdeeds,Holy cow! There are a ton of unexpected twists and turns in the fast and easy read. Even if you find fault with the characters the pace is fast enough to keep this enjoyable.I did find a few small editing issues (He instead of The and the like) but nothing that distracted from this adventurous caper.This book was given to me and I finished it on a around the world plane flight. I have since found the other in the series and will read them.
4,Excellent polish,"This product has been around for a long time. It's the best there is for any ferrous metal and even helps some stainless steel abrasions. For brass, silver or polished steel it can't be beat"
4,Not too good for carbon steel armor,Needs better instructions on what kind of tool you need to polish carbon steel with this product or you are going to be polishing by hand all day many days.
3,Terrible smell ... there are better products,"I decided to try this product based upon price and customer reviews. It is a decent polish, but no better than others I have used. My main complaint is the horrible petroleum smell of this stuff. It even stunk up the garbage in my kitchen trash can. I will henceforth only use this product for strictly outdoor use and I will go back to using Flitz, which I feel is a superior product with a less offensive odor."
5,NO LO PODIA CREER!,"Sabes que este libro maravilloso que abona y agudiza la inteligencia del bebe tiene juegos PARA EL NIÑO DE MENOS DE UNA SEMANA DE NACIDO ?????GENIAL !Mis dos nenes son los mas adelantados de la escuela, y les pudo decir lo mismo que dicen los boxeadores: ""TODO SE LO DEBO A ESTE LIBRO, QUE FUE NUESTRO MANAGER !"
5,"When our first child was born, we did not know","about this amazing book !He is a very bright kid (12 years old ), but, never as alert and sharp and witth like his sister, who was brought up with this early stimulation manual..."
2,Reconditioned?,"I ordered this drill as the price couldn't be beat. It is now on the way back as the chuck would not tighten. It was in the full open position and obviously had been used in a vice, probably to try and free it up. If it went back to the factory to get reconditioned they must have plugged it in and said that it worked and not actually tried it. I have returned it and will try another, because the price point can't be beat, but if the next one is the same way I'll ask for my money back. I've never had a problem with reconditioned equipment before."
4,out of date but still wonderful !!!,"this is a landmark program and though it is somewhat out of date at this point (we now know that the universe is accellerating in it's expansion, which defeats many ideas offered by Ferris) it is none the less an outstanding presentation of basic cosmology that almost any layman could understand and enjoy. The exquisite brian eno soundtrack is only one of many high points. Read Hawking. Read Ferris. See this video. Go to bed feeling so small in the scheme of the universe that you'll want to read more to feel more important !!!! :-)"
2,Dated quasi-religious cosmology,The physics is certainly very good but this seventeen year old production is very dated. It contains some very eminent physicists which are worth hearing but you hear what they thought almost two decades ago. It is tinged with religion and I wonder about the background of the people behind this production. Lots of organ music and religious symbolism. Sorry I bought it.
2,DVD flawed,"The DVD has two flaws on it. The first occurs at time 37:05, a tone is heard over Timothy Ferris's commentary. A second, and more severe tone is heard at 38:05, also cutting out his commentary. I've purchased 2 copies already and both have the same flaws on them. PBS refuses to acknowledge the fault was caused in the transfer process. You're better off purchasing the video tape as the program is wonderful."
3,disappointed,"Note that this is for the FLUTE I mistakenly bought it thinking this book was for the piano, furthering my disappointment it does not contain lyrics. I am forced to return it. I am not blaming... because it was my mistake but i would like to see FLUTE a little more clearly."
2,Be Careful,this is not a recording with Miss Sills. there are 2 tracks included of Miss Sills from the opera Faust.Tthese 2 tracks are also included on the recording of Sapho. I recieved both as gifts from my wish list not aware of this. My fault for not researching this fully. I wish the description would have been more clear.
1,worthless h7 bulbs,"I recently changed my HID h7 xenon for this pair of useless bulbs, I missed the package so I can't return It.... they don't shine like said and no color, yellow light comes...."
2,"Cute, but not effective","I had such high hopes for this product. The concept is great and I desperately needed something to help my newborn keep a pacifer in her mouth. But, alas, this was not the product. While cute, it didn't have enough weight to do the job. It popped out of her mouth as often as a normal pacifier. It is now sitting in a drawer somewhere."
3,Too big,"Tis is a great braclette for a man, but for me, I have small wrist, it is way too big, and its not adjustable at all. needless to say I haven't been able to wear it but Im going to look into getting it sized down, other wise Im gonna give it to my brother."
1,Apex Penicillin Allergy Bracelet,"CHEAP. Broke the second time my husband wore it. Would not buy it, very dissappointed with the purchase.Do not buy if you leave the house."
3,Difficult to close,"I ordred this product because I'm allergic to Penicilin and although it's comfortable to wear, it is a major headache to put it on, it has a sort of hook that was hard to figure out. Plus it's not very strong, I've accidentally snapped it a couple of times but was able to put it back together."
5,Bracelet,"I really enjoy this, however it is too big and making it smaller has become an issue but I really love having an allergy bracelet in case of an emergency."
4,brief overviews on key points of creation evidence,"Overall I liked this book. It is not meant to be in depth, but the author lists all source so the reader can make a more in depth study. A good book for those wanting to more about the general evidences for creation"
4,evidence for a young universe for the average person,"Evidence for a young earth is presented in an easy-to-understand style. The author clearly presents the evidence along with analogies to help the reader understand. He does a good job of staying focused on his goal of supporting his claims with science. Since the book was written to appeal to the common person, specific studies are not cited or discussed in great detail. However, it is a good overview and a good place to begin further investigation. For an in-depth exploration of evidence to support a younger earth than textbooks claim you would need to look elsewhere."
1,"Special Pleading, rhetorical, shoddy scholarship.","Yet another Creationist propaganda book that purports toshow Earth being about 10,000 years old. The author shouldstick to pounding the pulpit on Sundays."
5,Stanley Tool Bag,"I was bit skeptical at first buying this bag because I wasn't sure about the space, but this bag fits my drill, hammer and small essential tools. And it's very sturdy!!! Great deal!!!!!"
2,Small,I got this bag and it was small. The way it closed you would put anything tall in there. Nice material and good of you don't need to put to much in there.
1,"Cute ""Toy Tool"" Bag",This is a very very very SMALL BAG! It DOES NOT OPEN UP VERY WIDE either. If you have any amount of tools at all you will not like this bag because there is NO ROOM for you to move things around! If you have just 4 to 6 tools you want in it and they are not large I guess it might be okay. I just do not care for it. But then no one else in the house is likely going to wish it was their's. It's a safe bet you will get to keep this one.
3,Stanley Consumer Storage Tool bag,"I used the bag for 2 days before the zipper broke, other than that Its a decent tool bag. The bag is a good size for small tools."
4,Well made,"Good design, looks like it will stand up to many years of use. Not too big, but that's what i was looking for to store a few tools in a vehicle."
4,Perfect mini tool bag,"I purchased this due to another reviews comment on using it for tools while on the trails. So I thought this would be a good size. It is rather small but nicely constructed material and not cheap feeling (nice n' sturdy). If you're needing a bag to fit a lot of larger tools I'd go with something bigger than this size. But, it does well for the smaller stuff. I'll probably be getting a size up bag for the bigger tools."
3,Picture is deceiving,"Bag was way to small would be good for maybe electrical parts things that are small, but to put tools like drills and other large tools no good"
4,Cute if you like retrievers or puppies.,"There are definately some pictures I like better than others, but overall a very cute calendar. Most of the puppies look very similar and are similar in age. Only one photo shows a mother and pups, and one is of an older ""puppy"" who's still in that gawky stage. Great for a kids calendar."
4,An interesting book,"I've always been interested in learning more about Latin America. I found this book to be very readable. It gives vivid pictures of Latin American figures and reports an in depth review and analysis of problems surrounding Latin America. The short stories covers Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, Peru and figures such as Evita Peron, Fidel Castro, Che, among others. The author is very knowledgable and draws on her personal experiences to add on her snapshots. Overall, ""Looking for History"" is quite a worthwhile read for those who wants to get their toes in the water of Latin America history."
2,A view from the Four Seasons,"Is Alma Guillermoprieto a LatinAmerican writer? She seems to be one of those New York Times ""smart"" reporters that look at Latin America from a 5 star hotel bar. Pretty mediocre interpretation of dramatic events."
3,"great music, poor message","Sounds great, but don't buy it expecting a Christian cd. I wanted to find the good in this album, so I studied the lyrics pretty hard and if anything it seems to be taking shots against Christianity. Klayton said himself in an online article, ""Technology and what I do musically are the only things I live for"". Doesn't sound like the hope that is Christ, does it?"
5,best alblum under the circle of dust name!,out of the three alblums diengage is definetly the best one to date i can't wait for the angeldust project is done and in the stores. clay scott rocks man!
4,Klay brings forth electronic rock as it was meant to be,"Disengage is a sort of an album/remix album put into one single package. The music is a brand very much it's own with a 70/30 electronics to rock ratio. This is in my opinion the finest work of klay Scott there is. And if that weren't enough, the second half of the cd are all mangled, twisted, beatifully distorted versions of the songs at the beginning. If you are into such bands as razed in black, nine inch nails, chemlab....this is most likely for you."
4,Innovative metal/dance album,"This is the last and best Circle of Dust cd. It has a lot of energy and a lot of songs. The second half of the album is basically dance remix's of the first half. I can't compare them with any other band, because this album is very original and innovative. This cd would play well at a rave, if you like that kind of music."
5,Intriguing,"Thought provoking, to say the least. I almost like this band as much as my three favorite artists, Megadeth, Iced Earth and Styx. They are a Christian Band (I checked the website ...), but the lyrics are extremely vague. Some other good industrial Christian bands are Wyrick, Skillet and Klank"
1,AMAZING POOR,"VERY BAD QUALITY, THE NIGHT SENSOR DOESN'T WORK, THE BATTERIES DRAIN QUICK, TRASH FOR CASH, PLEASE DON'T BUY PILOT VALVE CAPS, SUCKS!!!"
1,"Poor Quality, Expensive!",This is the worst valve cap I ever bought. I been buying different type of LED valve cap on Ebay and Amazon and this is by far the WORST quality. The whole thing is made from cheap plastic. The light sensor DOES NOT work. The battery runs out in less than a week. The clear plastic covering the top came out the first day I used it. The whole thing is huge compared to other valve cap LED. The LED is very dull with the 2 default battery.
3,cheaply made,These are wonderful to have but the ones here are weak. I already broke the 3/8 to 1/2. I went out and got impact adapters and called it a day.
5,Great for a mechanic.,"Very handy for working on cars. The adapters allow me to using large socket wrench with small sockets to get leverage, as well as using small socket wrench with large sockets in tight spaces."
1,Broke,"The second time I used the 1/2"" to 3/8"" adapter, it snapped right off. I was only taking off a lug nut. cheap!!!!"
1,crapola,"Absolutely worthless. Head is wobbly under all circumstance. Crappy hard molded plastic leg-ends do not sit flat on a flat surface. Monopod, which is too short to be begin with, does not lock sufficiently to apply the slightest downward pressure. In short, a tool intended for stability becomes a balancing act instead. Counterproductive in the extreme."
4,I wanted more....,"I'm a history buff, and I wanted more detail, especially about how GC had evolved in the later 20th century. But otherwise I really enjoyed it."
3,Shoeless Joe,If you are a baseball fan you my enjoy this read. As an Anerican History teacher I have used bits and pieces of this story to help my students understand early baseball history. My only causion is some of the language may not be appropriate for school. Other than that it is very true to life.
4,exactly as described,"The sulky was exactly as described , works well, prompt delivery,makes mowing easy , would definitely recommend !!!! built well. I used on a commercial mower."
4,read it aloud,"I can see why some would compare the writing style to Hemingway, but Dermout's imprint is clearly a feminine one. The language is simple and the sense of nostalgia it conjures is rich and complex, but it is never tinged by the scent of spilled beer - rather, crushed flowers. This is a dreamy tale with a core of sadness. Read it aloud to someone and notice how your appreciation of the story grows."
5,Mysterious and lovely,"Dermout's classic novel is the kind the New York Review of Books Classics loves to bring out: a cult favorite with a one-of-a-kind flavor. The dreamy, simple tone belies the extreme formal complexity of the work: actually consisting really of a novella and several appended tales, the work brings everything together at the conclusion. This is a book to be read and re-read; its mysteries are not readily plumbed but are rewarding nonetheless."
1,I should have bought the Bosch,"I am on my second saw in 6 months with little useGood points:Lots of powerAccepted universial and T shank bladesBad points:Sole plate sticks and is hard to accurately adjust.Both saws pulled to the left when cutting.Could not cut a straight line using a guide fence, blade would pop out of guide roller or pull the wood lose from a clamped down guide fence resulting in a bowed cut. The cut was also off perpenducilar. Got two different stories from Dewalt on this. One person said it should saw with a guide fence(straightedge) another person said it wouldn't and I needed to buy a different tool."
4,Need to improve Keyless blade,I purchased this item and the only problem that I have found is the keyless blade system. The operator manual doesn't mention that you must have the blade attachment at the right position before the keyless blade will function. To set the blade attachments to the right position you will have to operate the jig saw and try to stop the reciprocating blade shaft attachment to the exact position. This will require few trys and lots of patience.
1,a shoeless wonder,"The black shoe falls off regularly (which knocks the transparent covers off, as well). Received a replacement, but don't know if it's going to work. Grat for sawing curves with bevels...just can't saw straight at 90 degrees. Blades bend from lateral movement while sawing. Not a good 'un. Go with Bosch or Porter Cable. Got sharp teeth? Buy a coping saw. Or a knife. Wish I had...."
2,refurbished DEWALT Jig Saw,The Jig saw that I received seem to be used for at least 6 month or so. There are lots of scratches on the body and the buttom of the saw. Unfortunately I could not return it on time so I am stuck with it.
2,I expected better,I expected better from these Panasonics but I guess even with Panasonic you get what you pay for. Could have gotten the same quality for less at Wally World.
1,Horrible!,"I was excited to watch this film after reading the reviews and description. It sounding right up my alley described as a Kubrick style film with Trippy visuals; However I hated it. It practically has no plot, or at least it feels that way, it shouldn't take you until the end of the movie for something to actually happen, and then by that time you don't care and can't believe you've actually made it to the last ten minutes of the movie. It's very slow and boring. Although this film is made well, has Cool imagery and I did like some of the music, it's not enough to keep you interested. I love weird movies and have an open Mind, but honestly it's very boring and you lose interest very quickly. It's hard to even call this a movie. It really just seemed like you were watching someone have a bad acid trip. Its a Shame since it was visually well done and an interesting storyline, but it was nothing more but a massive disappointment. Do not waste $4"
1,I Hated It,"I saw this film in April 2012 as a part of a film festival in Santa Cruz. The title and plot seemed very interesting so I took a chance and viewed it versus a foreign film. I made the wrong choice that night. This film is incredibly slow, I wasn't the only one frustrated with this film. It was so bad that some parts were funny. I found that this film lack a cohesive plot and sought to mesmerize you with visuals without much substance. It was very anti-climatic as well which was a huge meltdown. And the end was very sudden, I didn't think there was a clear wrap-up at all, it just ended. I love movies, I've seen good and I've seen bad, this one lands at the top of the list. Not sure if this will ever be dethroned as the worst film that I've ever seen."
1,Cinematographical crap,"If you ever wanted to watch hours of acid trips coupled with 50's styled sound effects and a paucity of plot that creeps slowly forward to what end I shall never know due to my inability to waste more than an hour of my time attempting to digest this niche film, then Beyond the Black Rainbow is for you. As for me, I am moving on after resoundingly rejecting the film major fetish and demanding some progress in the plot without the painfully slow accompaniment of poorly focused, over developed camera art and the score from Forbidden Planet."
1,Save your money,"Save your money. If your a space cadet that's into LSD and hard drugs you might like this movie? This movie is a long drawn out mess with no plot. I saw no poetry in this movie. It sucked, would rather sit on the deck. The person that created this movie is unstable. A nightmare to watch. Just throw your money out on the street instead of paying for this. A strange demented mess I'll never go through again."
1,Cool sureal mood does not make up for pointless violence.,"If you like pointless violence inflicted upon helpless women and watching the slow psychological torture of a young girl then you might like this movie. I watched the whole thing waiting for her to fight back with her special powers, and she never does. Sigh. Big build up, big let down."
1,Sucked,Bizarre. Made no sense at all. Didn't seem to remotely resemble the description until the last few seconds and then it was WTF ?
2,Was your mother crazy?,"umm, well, umm, i don't know what to say. It's not your mother's kind of movie. I don't know what these people are on, but I don't think I want to try any."
1,Slower than Snail,"This movie was so ""artsy fartsy"" I almost lapsed into a coma trying to watch it. If my dog hadn't nudged my arm I wouldn't have awakened in time to turn the damned thing off. I'm not even sure what the story was, it was so slow and un-engaging, I couldn't get interested in any of the characters and didn't care what happened to them."
1,Do Not Watch,"This was complete junk. I was hoping it would be an entertaining low budget horror film like Phantasm. However, the actors mumbled their words, the main character did not speak, and the movie contained annoying sound and visual effects that just would not stop. You will notice this in the beginning - it never gets any better."
3,Style to burn but no story,"A young woman is trapped in a room in a lab, being observed and experimented on. A sinister doctor talks to her through the glass every day but she never responds or even looks at him. The neon-coated visuals, synth soundtrack and antique computer monitor displays are all meant to give the impression that this is a movie made in the early 1980's, a fact further reinforced by a scene in which Ronald Reagan makes an appearance on a television screen. Beyond the Black Rainbow looks and sounds great--one just wishes that it was more than an empty-headed exercise in style. In terms of story virtually nothing happens. You never find out much of anything about either of the main characters and there's no suspense or twists or action or anything--just those pretty visuals and a soundtrack that John Carpenter probably would have been pleased with. This is worth a look but it could have been a whole lot better.."
2,Worth watching only once,"Visually stunning, the throw back effects are certainly interesting, however the plot and story are so bad, it drowns out any beauty."
2,boring and blurry,"Expected great things from this one. Wow-Huge letdown. Mega boring,visuals are'nt all that and any comparisons to Lynch or Kubrick or anyone truly inspiring way off. Some bleary images, sad cute chick and timothy leary type dialogue don't instantly make a classic cult flick. Classic crap maybe"
4,very different,"this is such a strange movie. it reminds me of late 70's early 80's scifi movies like 2001 space odessy. it was so odd, i gave it a 4 out of 5 stars."
1,60's retread,All the emptiness of a 60's acid trip. Apparently there are still those who find a need to share their latest bummer pictorially. They seemed really stressed to come up with the 37 words of dialogue. 0.1 stars at best.
1,Someone thinks he's Stanley Kubrick. Someone's wrong.,You might enjoy this movie if you're stoned out of your mind. Other than that it's just a half-baked attempt by some film school drop out to make movie like A Clockwork Orange or something. Boring and lame all around.
5,More experience than entertainment,"After seeing the trailer for this bizarre flick, I knew I had to see it. The 80s synth music, bold colors and mysterious looking characters just sucked me in. The film itself was just what I expected from the trailer: psychological and very obscure. This is not a film for everyone, but one that someone who appreciates out-of-the-box style with simple gorgeous and haunting cinematography will find themselves in for a treat with this one. The film is more experience than entertainment.Source: criticnic.com 3-October-2012Disclosure: Film sent by Magnet Releaseing"
2,Interesting concept with frustrating presentation,"At the end of this film I found myself wondering what the point was. The entire film was fairly hazy, trippy, feverish... and at the end there were simply too many untied loose ends. I think the film has promise, the story is interesting, but the presentation is frustratingly slow, unnessisarily confusing and artistically annoying. I understand it's a retro-style film, but the visual style was so over done it really gave me a headache. And I like artsy, exploratory films... just not this one. I gave it it's fair shakedown and it didn't impress, but it wasn't completely worthless, so 2 stars."
3,Not sure just yet.,I'm just not sure what to think about this. It was all over the place. The lighing was too bright. The music was annoying and BooooogBONGeddddd over the speaking of the actor.
4,Check it out,"I couldn't give a better review then this one that I found on Netflix, ""The sets, score, and cinematography are worthy of a five star movie, but the glacial pace knocked it down to four. It could easily have lost half an hour."" In my own annotation I would say the director was perhaps paying homage to style over script and while this plays to the core audience of the film in the most general sense it would be more appealing to it's niche if the director beefed up the plot-line.Still, a remarkable work of visual art made by a director who has earned my respect and interest into his future endeavors."
2,post millenium geek pop,"Critics are calling PJ's blend of pop rock post millenium, pushing rock n roll in new directions which is true. His mix of standard guitar, bass and drums overlapped with electronic sequencing fails, however, at truely engaging the listener with any emotion. In addition, its very difficult to get over PJ's geeky vocal delivery and his lyrics leave much to be desired. Peace, love and understanding is a noble pursuit however PJ's music does nothing to keep the listener wanting to hear more. Rather it provides a bouncy, upbeat soundtrack that annoys rather than intrigues. Noble effort, better luck next time."
5,No Surprises,"Keith Jarrett's trio is the McDonald's of jazz. Its greatest sales asset is consistency: You know what to expect. If you liked one of their CDs, you're going to like the rest. They take a half-dozen standards and play each for eight or ten minutes, passing around solos. Lather, rinse, repeat.If you're familiar with the band, there's nothing to say about this box set. If you like their stuff, buy it. If you don't like their stuff, buy something else. And if you're not familiar with the band, the introduction is simple: It's a really good piano trio playing standards. There aren't any surprises.If you like the Jarrett trio's work, you'll also enjoy Alex Riel's ""Celebration."""
2,Why I won't see Buffett live,"I am a huge Jimmy Buffett fan, but this album is the reason I won't go see him in concert. He's played these songs so many times he's clearly bored with them, and you're much better off hearing them on the studio recordings. One exception, however, is 'Gypsies in the Palace', which is great in a live format."
2,A snooze,"Buffett has never been known for his great singing voice or guitar virtuosity, but that has never been the appeal of his music. These are party songs and he brings the perpetual atmosphere of island life to his concerts. For Parrotheads, this CD is a great way to live or, in many case, re-live that experience. For the casual fan of his music, who is looking for some great live music, this CD is a bore. Bland renditions of some of his hits, combined with inane banter in between songs simply makes for a dull listen. Parrotheads will likely enjoy this, while all others should probably steer clear."
5,The Essential Jimmy Buffett,"This is simply the pinnacle of Jimmy Buffett's art (Jimmy would probably cringe at the word; sorry, Jim), period. Most live albums are noisy, ragged, poorly mixed and at least a little off-key. Miraculously, ""Feeding Frenzy"" is none of those. It is tight, energetic, and it just drips fun every second. The arrangements are fuller than many of Jimmy's studio cuts, with superb backup vocals and that wonderful steel drum that defines Jimmy Buffett to me, and Jimmy's intonation is dead-on every note.If you can only own one Jimmy Buffett album, make it ""Feeding Frenzy."""
2,Not so hot,"If you want a good Buffett live CD, get ""You had to be there"" instead. In this CD he banters with the crowd and ad libs the songs TOO much; in some songs the quality suffers. ""Today's Message"" is a complete waste of time. I made a copy of this CD without this track wo I wouldn't have to hit the 'skip' button every time."
2,Jimmy can fool you,"Jimmy Buffet is great but every once in a while he can fool you. He turns out CD's not to make music but to make money. This is one of them. You can easily pass this one up and not miss a thing. Maybe the guy is getting too famous to have any more ""real"" experiences.Sorry Jimmy. Start hanging out in some bars again."
3,Reminiscences of Confederate Service,"A personable memoir of a young Londoner who ran the blockade in order to fight for the Confederacy. Dawson's account of sailing as an utter landlubber (but a fan of Marryat's novels) is among the best parts of the book, amusing and anecdotal. Learning quickly, Dawson joined the CS Navy but quickly transferred to the artillery as an ordnance officer for first Longstreet and then Fitz Lee. His book includes Pickett's Charge, a not very vivid account of Longstreet's Burnside impersonation (versus Burnside!) at Fort Sanders, and the friendly-fire incident at the Wilderness that killed the brilliant young Micah Jenkins and badly wounded Longstreet. Not a deeply informative memoir, but a well-written and appealing one."
5,UNBELIEVABLE,"I'm not going to go into detail about this cd but I can tell you this: THIS IS MILES ABOVE their debut release and is absolutely amazing. Vocals , Production and Guitar Work are all totally stellar. If you took Stratovarius , Nightwish , Fairyland and Rhapsody and put them together then you'd have this masterpiece. Do not hesitate to purchase this disc , you will not regret it. WOW!!"
3,"Good, with ""buts""","There are a lot of flavorful-sounding recipes in this book, and it goes far beyond the standard roast fare that makes up the bulk of so many other slow cooker recipe books. However, I was a little disappointed to see how many of the recipes called for prepared foods, such as jars of pesto, pasta sauce, salad dressing, and flavored cream cheeses. ""Simple"" cooking shouldn't mean that you use as many prepared, chemically-laden ingredients as possible."
3,"Good recipes, but...","I read this book and was eager to try the recipes until I discovered that they were tailored for a 3-4 quart slow cooker. I have a 6-quart cooker, and did not find instructions to make the recipes in a larger cooker. Until I go out to buy a smaller cooker, I won't make the recipes."
5,It works.,The light is bright and it works. It fits nicely into my mixer. It's a light. It either works or doesn't! It has my support.
4,Super!,Just what I needed. They are well made and w easy to install. It took me 10 minute to install two.
1,Outrageous price !,"This is the only reason I gave it one star, because Frey is my favorite musician."
4,Great Game..But Very Short.,"The good news is that if you're a fan of the Dracula/horror genre then this game will completely engross you. The storyline is very intriguing and the cut scenes are beautifully rendered. The bad news is that your fun will be short lived. The game does not last long at all despite being a two disc set. Even the most novice of gamers will breeze through this in no time. The ending is somewhat anticlimactic as there is no real showdown with Dracula and the game leaves the door wide open for an obvious sequel. Still, it remains an entertaining little game that is probably better off as a rental because of it's brevity."
4,Good Things Never Last...,"An excellent game with vivid, creepy characters. Not quite like anything I've played so far. My only complaint is how quickly it ended. I've dabbled in this type of game for a few years, and though I have a long way to go before being a ""Pro"", I finished this game in just over 2 1/2 hours. As one person suggested, rent it. It's great and definitely worth it, but it's a little too much for just a couple hours of gameplay."
2,Ressurection Time Crisis,I Dont think you should by this game. First lets start with the bads. You dont ever get to actually shoot a gun. All you do is use the arrow buttons to look around. The inventory is poor. Trust me you wont like this game if you are looking for a challenge. Its not a role playing game and it isnt a good game either.... In the game all you do is use the arrow keys to turn. When you want to move around you haveto wait until you see a arrow pointing to were you want to go. The press the action button to move. Their is one pro whitch is the graphics. That is the only good thing about that game...
2,Photographic Afterthought,"Unlike Breyer's Classic Battleships and Battlecruisers 1905-1970, this book will never make the top 50 list of books about its subject. Breyer put this volume together because readers had complained that his great previous work had no pictures; they are cretins. He dutifully responded with this effort. The only real value here is that the pictures themselves are unusual and interesting; even some very familiar ships seem unrecognizable because of the angle of the shot.I originally rejected this book when it was first published and then came across it years later in a second hand shop and added it to my collection only for the sake of completeness. That should be your only objective too; don't get your expectations up with this one. Just Thank God Breyer didn't ruin his first book trying to please everyone."
4,An excellent addition for anyone fascinated with battlehips.,"I was lucky enough to find this book at a local book store for $12.50 and it would be well worth many times that amount. While the book does not delve too deeply into technical detail, the number of photos and anecdotes about the history of each ship is immense. I especially enjoy the large coverage given ships and navies not commonly seen in books or on video. An excellent book for any naval history nut (such as myself!)."
4,A Great Learning Tool,"Marketing for Dummies is one of the best books a person can read to achieve a comprehensive understanding of marketing and its influence on the business world. The book's use of descriptive, understandable language and its focus on the essential ""4 P's of Marketing"" make it a much needed read for anyone new to the business world. The author carefully lays out the necessities of a marketing position, the goals of the marketing department, and powerful tools used to perform this essential part of business effectively and as economically as possible."
3,Powerflow mudflaps for Toyota pickup,"These mudflaps were smaller than the original mudflaps on my 1994 Toyota pickup, and seemed very light duty. I returned them."
4,MA ia a Crybaby!,"Mary Anne is such a crybaby. I mean, she's 13 and hasn't grown out of crying IN PUBLIC. She's scared when Dawn pulls this dopey prank on her, and she's so spoiled! In the chapter when she and Richard move to Dawn's, MA crys over little things like cleaning supplise, not to metion is way overprotective of Tiger! Of course the movers wouldn't drop a chair on him! Furthermore, MA blames everything on Dawn. I agree with Dawn - Mary Anne is the wicked stepsister of Stoneybrook!I gave this book 5 stars, however, for Dawn. She tried her hardest to put up with her wicked stepsister and played an incredible prank on MA. Way to go, Dawn!"
5,Very real portrayal on stepfamily adjustment!,"I liked this! It was a very real portrayal of the struggles to adjust to life in a stepfamily. Dawn discovers that being friends with someone & LIVING with that person are two different things. Dawn & Mary Anne each have different habits, like Dawn is a vegetarian & Mary Anne is a junk-food & meat lover. They discover that the CAN'T share a room & nearly drive each other to the brink of insanity when Dawn wants the radio on & Mary Anne needs complete silence to study. I thought it was funny & creative how Dawn thinks up a way to scare Mary Anne, who still believes in ghosts, into a near-faint! Poor Mary Anne! All in all...realistic."
4,Mary Anne Needs A Taste Of Her Own Medicine!,In this book Dawn and Mary Anne becaome stepsisters. Now you would probably think that's the best thing to happen to two best friends but it's a disaster once Mary Anne moves into Dawn's house(they share a room at first). First of all Mary Anne complains about Dawn's mom!Next she insults Dawn right IN HER FACE!Dawn has had enough so she stirs up a plan to scare Mary Anne out of her room and makes her move into her own room.Mary Anne deserves that!
3,Weird Game,"OK, So I bought the game. My Sis & I played it all the way through (co-op). It's a funny and weird game. It got a little boring munching all the time. Loved the different areas we got to go munching in. Fun to drive the different vehicles and make new zombies. The new zombies got a little irritating when they would eat ""our food"", so we had to destroy them too. haha I don't think it was worth the $50 I spent on it. I would suggest maybe renting first and then if you want it, buy it used. All in all is was fun to play and entertaining."
4,Very Original.,"This game has to be the most oridinal game ever. its like the direct oppisite from redident evil. one thing though is that fighting cops really is hard to do without loosing a good chunk of health.not all that big, but its more of an annoyance, than a challenge. the fact that you can use your pancreas as a grenade is cool, though the fuse is WAY too long. i swear it has a 15-20 second fuse. thats just not right. It took me by surprise, but there are vehicles in the game. so anyway, Id suggest rent it first."
4,severly under rated zombie game,"I remember way back in high school when this game was first mentioned. I saw the reviews for it and some game play stills and thought it looked fun. Problem was over all that time I searched every store I came across for a copy and I never did find one. so fast forward a good..7 years to now when I finally found a copy that was actually affordable.This game is hard to find and is kind of pricey for a good reason. It has good solid game play, the storyline is hokey but enjoyable and adds to the fun of the atmosphere, and honestly, who hasn't played a zombie game and thought to yourself ""gee whiz, wouldn't it be fun if I could play the role of the zombie?"" well stubbs lets you do it.My personal review honestly cant do this game justice so ill just leave it off here with if you are looking for a fun relatively hard to find game, or have a passion for zombies, rpg's and general silliness then stubbs is the game for you."
3,Still a classic,The game is an older game but still alot of fun to play. My child has been playing it ever since I bought it. The only problem was having to buy a hard drive for the X-Box 360 in order to play it.
1,How Do I Know When I Never Received It ???!!!,"Have'nt a clue how good or bad the game is. Amazon tried twice to ship it to me ,but I never received it! it was a Christmas present for my brother,needless to say he never received it!I just bought this game for him on Ebay (new) and I received it in three days!What's the deal, Amazon ?"
3,"Not bad, not great.","Think of it as Grand Theft Auto, but as zombies - - it's a amusing game but not anything spectacular."
5,Ny cats love this!,"All three of my cats love this chicken treat, and one thinks it is the very best thing in the whole world!"
4,Great treat for diabetic pets,"Bought these treats for my diabetic cat, as he can't have any treats with ""stuff"" added to them. These are completly natural and high in protein. They do have sodium added however, so I use them sparingly. My cat inhales them!!! The chunks are a little too big for a cat's mouth, but very easy to break into smaller pieces. Overall, great natural treat."
5,Cat Treats,"My cat is totally addicted to this product. He LOVES them. I wish I could buy them locally, but for now it looks like I will have to keep finding good vendors like this one and get them online. Because trust me, he can't live without them!! :)"
5,Even Marilyn MonSnows likes them!!!,"This is the first treat I have found that my cat with ""discerning taste"" (aka ""finicky"") will eat! My other cat and my dog absolutely love them too (but they aren't as hard to please). I am thrilled to find a treat Snows is excited about eating. Only wish they cost a bit less....A note for older pets or pets who can't chew hard treats - the Halo freeze dried chicken is very light and soft, so if you are having a hard time finding a good treat, I recommend giving these a try."
1,DON'T ORDER!!,I have returned this! There are some hard pieces that will not allow me to crumble to put on pets' food so they had to be thrown out. What are they? Wood? Not acceptable! Returned and will not order again!!
1,Picky Kitty,"My cat deemed these treats fit for hockey games only. He wouldn't eat them, but had no problems shooting them under my couch."
5,FOR THE TRULY FINICKY CAT,"Had just about given up on ever finding a treat for my kitty Zummy ~ I tried them all ... everything from the cheapy supermarket brands to the ones that come from Whole Foods andare organic ... then a close friend gave me a few (from her cat Travis's stash), to let Zummy have a taste ... well, she devoured them, inhaled them and wanted more. We are on our first container, and everytime I head toward the refrigerator Zumis at my heals waiting for more! I wouldn't have believed it until I saw it with my own eyes. Not cheap tho ~ but Amazon definitely has the best price! Guaranteed to please for sure... if Zummy loves it, your cat will to!!!"
1,Maybe better treat for cats,"The concept is good, the snack is nutritious, but in ordering from Amazon, there was practically nothing but dust in the bag. The couple of treats that were left uncrushed were practically air and my 71 pound dog looked at me as if I were playing a joke on her."
4,"Cat likes them, doesn't go crazy","My kitten eats these right away, but she doesn't go crazy over them. Also a very small package for the money."
5,Great Product!,"These treats are great for cats, I call it Kitty Crack......great product, great price, fast delivery."
4,Practically perfect,"Halo makes great products, my cats love them. They especially love the Liv-a-Littles White Meat Chicken Protein Treats. The only issue I have is that lately they seem to contain more pieces that are so hard I can't even break them apart. Obviously, if I can't break them, my 6 month old kittens don't stand a chance. I keep buying them because they are superior to everything else on the market (in my opinion), but given the cost, it does get a bit pricey."
2,"Really, really small container of dog treats","My dog is ho-hum about these treats. Don't be fooled by the picture - the package is very small and the treats themselves look like and have the consistency of styrafoam packaging peanuts. I love Halo's other dog treats, especially the little baked snacks. For $9.95, I really don't feel this is a good value at all. Disappointed."
5,great treat for our cat,our cat has been getting chemo for the last year and our vet was very concerned about her losing weight. These treats made a big difference - she has gone bonkers over the Halo chicken treats and she has gained almost 2 lbs. since we began giving them to her.
2,Has Sodium Phosphate in it,"Sodium phosphate is a preservative. So these are not chemical and preservative free. That's the part I read, but I should have read more carefully. I didn't realize it was in there when I ordered these for my cats. One cat ignores them, but my other one loves them. But sodium phosphate causes me terrible migraines so I stay away from it in my foods and medicines. Even a little bit has a bad effect on me. This makes me very wary about giving it to my cat. The salmon has no marinade and therefore no sodium phosphate, so I'll get that one again. I wish the chicken was more pure. I don't do many reviews but I thought I should point this out in case it makes a difference to anyone else. I'm always looking for healthy food for my cats and dog. Not sure this is, with that chemical in it."
1,TOO TINY,"This pc is 1/8th the screen shot, you need a maginifying glass to read it, if I had had a return slip in the pgk I would have returned it !1 star is 1 too many but they do not allow for -stars."
2,Seems to be getting worse,"I flipped through one of these in a waiting room and was so intrigued at the time I decided to subscribe. It feels like each consecutive month the magazine is getting more and more boring and long winded with their articles. It is far from the realm of National Geographic, which has some stunning pictures and photo shoots to accompony their articles. A typical article in this has turned into a drab, 6 page sleeping pill. The only interesting part to me now is the Q&A with the experts in the back."
3,interesting but that's it,It is an interesting magazine but it's just not my thing. Good for those who enjoy the a wide range of topics.
3,New Format Detracts,"Smithsonian used to be informative and intriguing. Now it looks like any other pop culture mag. A whole issue on food?? I can go to Cuisine for that. Articles in this current issue (May) look depressingly like People and the new version of Time--slick, clever, shallow, ""with it."" That's not what Smithsonian was all about--it dealt with varied topics that surprised. I can get shallow by turning on the TV or watching the Huffington Post. Won't be renewing."
4,Back to being great!,"Previous review from April 2012: Smithsonian Magazine used to be thick and full of intelligent articles. It's been stripped down and dumbed down. Disappointed. Will not renew.Update Nov 2012: Glad to say that the latest issues have been very rewarding, things seemed to have turned around with the newish editor. Am pleased!"
5,Always interesting,"We have had a subscription to the Smithsonian Magazine for over 3 years and it never disappoints. The articles are well-written, interesting, informative and varied. It's the type of magazine that you will pick up several times and read. None of the articles are exceptionally long so it's easy to enjoy even when you only have a few minutes. In addition to a variety of topics (something for everyone), the Smithsonian Magazine also includes information about the exhibits and programs that are available through the Smithsonian museum and its affiliates. If you enjoy all that the nation's capital has to offer, then you will particularly enjoy this magazine. And finally, by subscribing to it, you are supporting the museums and their on-going research. I highly recommend it."
5,Smithsonian bargain,"The Smithsonian magazine is a fascinating world-encompassing treasure and an exciting, much anticipated monthly ""mind stretcher"". At a discounted $12/year price through Amazon, it's a remarkable bargain everyone should take advantage of!"
1,Smithsonian AD magazine,I ordered this along with the National Geographic for my 13 year old son. We have received two issues of the magazine and I am not at all impressed with the articles. It seems to me that it is mostly advertisements and I am looking to cancel my subscription.
4,Quick arrival,We we received our first issue of the Sithsonian Magazine yesterday. This was a quick turn around for a magazine. Looking forward to reading it.
2,Should be I don't know,It was ordered in the Fall as a Christmas gift. It has not arrived and Christmas is a few days away.
3,recipient might not have received it,This is an easy way to gift people but how can I tell if they are getting it other than coming right out and asking them. I think I used this particular magazine for four gifts over the holiday season.
5,Another gift.,"Again I have had a subscription to this magazine for a few years and got one for my friend last year for Christmas. Asked him this year if he wanted me to renew his subscription, I got an emphatic yes."
5,"""Grown to really love it. It's amazing.""","I bought this magazine for my mother. She is a geologist, nature lover, and science geek. I was pretty sure she was going to like it when I first ordered it, but when it came time to renew I asked if she wanted it again. Emphatically, she said, ""I've grown to really love it. It's amazing, yes please renew it."" I new it was a winner. High quality magazine."
5,Smithsonian,I really like the historical and natural science featured. The content is varied each issue and something always grabs my attention.
5,great gift,purchased this as a gift for my grandmother. the material is always up to date and current. it makes great reading material when i visit her too :) it's a classic magazine that is great for young and old alike.
3,An interesting effort.,The Dogmatic Imagination is a short book intended to be an aid to catechesis for young people. In 24 short essays Reimer introduces a host of subjects that cover the key doctrines of Christianity (as Reimer understands them). To his credit Reimer does not actually attempt to teach what is to be believed but rather his essays can be seens as a case of setting the boundaries and then aencouraging his readers free range (hence the title The Dogmatic Imagination).The book is hard to review because i know from secondary literature Reimer's basic theological approach and it is not one i am happy with but it is hardly fair to judge this approach on this effort (his approach is outlined in Mennonites and Classical Theology - if I had the money I'd read it but alas i am poor)! Nontheless it is an interesting book and I would imagine would certainly would set new entrants to theological reflection on a good setting.
4,Great saw but...,"First one arrived damaged; probably during shipping. Amazon was quick to send another. The second saw arrived in great shape. I was a little disappointed because the first one had a 60 tooth blade, but the second only had a 32 tooth. Condition of the second saw was excellent-near new.This is a wonderful product for framing and general cross-cut work. It will handle 2x8's with ease. Additionally, it does quite well for crown molding. The positive stops are firmer than I expected, but not so much that I can't set it close to (but not actually in) a preset if needed.I am glad I bought the saw and although it took a little longer to return the damaged one than it would have if I had bought it locally, it saved me the time of 2 trips to the city (which is 30 minutes each way) and the price of a new saw plus sales tax."
4,Attachment availability,"The saw works perfectly after I went through the alignment. It should have been pre-aligned before it was shipped to me but no matter. I wondered what accessories were available for that saw. I am interested in piece clamps, support brackets and possibly a laser attachment. If you can help me with my search, I would be appreciative. I have sent an email directly to Dewalt with no response"
5,We love these steak knives!,"This is a really great set of steak knives. They're not dainty, if that's what you're looking for, but they're not quite as large as some I've seen in a steak house. They glide through any type of meat and feel solid in your hand. We just love them and will give them next year as gifts."
5,"So smooth, and so real. You won't see it coming.",Joe Colby lives the worst nightmare you can imagine. A wonderfully written tale of murder and revenge with a twist -- a surprise you have never before encountered in mysteries. Read this book today!
2,"Unrealistic Diaolgue & Actions, Bad Editing","Although this was a quick read, the characters, when not outright annoying, were cardboard and badly drawn without much substance. The dialogue was bad (what was the deal about that stupid ""'Holy! Holy!"" exclamation from the newsman's boss???!! The outcome was plain silly. And I can't believe that the author's written another book using 'Elmo Finn,' who was completely without depth and merit to be a central character. Waste of time."
1,Oh Hum,"About a dozen chapters in, you'll flip to the end to see if your suspicions are correct. They are. New writer, old device."
2,Average,"Well, I must say this movie is quite average. The disappointing side of it is the actors, they are not as attractive as they used to be in Playboy/Indigo Entertainment movies. The only exception is Katie Lohmann, who's gorgeous, but her only sex scene is not that explicit, not what you would expect from watching previous Playboy/Indigo Entertainment movies. There is also a lack of pink and close-ups which therefore makes this movie very similar to cheap, ordinary softcore movies. Having watched all Playboy/Indigo Entertainment movies since 1999/2000, I conclude that they are not doing any better, I just hope they read these criticism and bring them on board. I just hope their future releases are better, as the good old days!"
2,Not that sexy movie,"I'm going to have to stop buying stuff from the Playboy label. This is so lame. Predictable formula driven rubbish. A monkey could direct this junk. If you've seen one movie from Playboy then you've seen them all. If you already have one, save your money and just watch that over and over again."
4,Mary Carey,"I like this movie because of the scens with Mary Carey, and the rest of the film is good enough to watch also."
5,Brilliant political satire,"Lammers and Levin are way into hilarious! I heard some of this music on the Al Franken show but only recently realized the collection was available on CD. One review calls them ""hyprocisy busters"", and that sums up the album nicely. They mercilessly lampoon most of the GOP crew. I wish they'd done a couple more on Bush, but just their portrayal of Rush Limbaugh as a drug addicted, hyprocritical idiot is worth the price. Some tracks are weaker than others, but some will have you peeing your pants. The image of William Bennett preaching morality in a glitzy Las Vegas stage show is hilarious. Then there's a song like ""Sorry"" that's very funny, but the message behind it is so strong that it actual makes you uncomfortable. My only problem now is with the totally ridiculous kiddies' show sing along, ""The I Hate Ann Coulter Song""; It's one of those simple tunes that you can't get out of your head. Help!"
4,"A bit short, but very nice!",This dress is very pretty. I ordered a small (since that's what i wear normally) and it fit well. The material does not stretch though so it was a little on the tight side on my um ... top.
3,Buyer Beware,"Received this drill in April, in advance of a kitchen remodel job in May/June. When first used it sounded like there was gravel in it, and small pieces of clear plastic kept shooting from the openings around the motor fan. After digging out a piece that landed in my eye (guess you need safety glasses just to try out the drill), I called the DeWalt 800 warranty number. The number is Out Of Service! As a last ditch effort, I loosened the housing screws to see what was disintegrating inside the drill. Turns out the DeWalt repair tech had left an old level-cartridge (bubble level) inside the motor fan housing! Drill sounds OK now without the misplaced level rattling around inside - - but I am not impressed with their repair techs or warranty service. As a result, I am not expecting much of the drill and will stick with Porter Cable tools from now on."
3,when I was young,in my younger days I love this series I feel it ended to soon I think it's transformers meet GI Joe. I'm just bummed I'm already through the first season can't wait for the rest of it.
3,M.A.S.K. Vol. 1 review,"I would have preferred getting the entire series instead of this. Still, it made for a wonderful gift to my friend who loved this show while growing up. No problems as far as I know of with the disc,"
5,Traitor,I think the seller was prompt with the delivery of the movie and very much a considerable repeat purchase could happen in the future.
3,It was just O.K. to me...,Since the description of this movie has been stated many times I'm just going make it short & sweet by giving my personal opinion.I thought the movie was just O.K. It's not something I'd watch again & I'll quickly forget it. The entire movie revolved around the Muslim faith & terrorism. I personally don't care to watch movies where religion plays a big part. It just doesn't interest me. If you like that stuff in a movie I'm sure you'd find the movie interesting. Just don't expect a big action thriller. This movie is pretty slow & there's not much action.I am a 29-year-old female so this review is based on my opinion but I think it's only fair to point out that my husband who is also 29 loved the movie. He would've given it 5 stars.
2,"Don't but it for the ""Digital Copy""","The Digital Copy that ships on DVD is practically useless. It is incompatible with Mac, Ipod and iPhone, Zune, and only works with a Windows PC and a select few Media Players that support the defunct ""PlaysForSure"" format that Microsoft created but even they no longer support.I do have one of the supported media players, and a PC that meets all the requirements, but even so I cannot get the Digital Copy to transfer. I spent 45 minutes trying to transfer, rebooting etc, but no joy.Why do the studios make it so difficult to get a legal copy of the movie onto the most widely used media players? They should make it clear upfront that the digital copy is incompatible with 90% of players so that people aren't fooled into thinking it is a worthwhile bonus feature. Very Disappointing, STARZ should be ashamed"
2,Later Traitor,"Well made, but not very believable. A Hollywood attempt to go ""behind the scenes"" of Islamic terrorism (and U.S. counterterrorism) that only manages to play to all the usual stereotypes and clichés"
2,Unsatisfying,"Despite the strength of the film's acting and craftsmanship, it's caught between wanting to be both an open-hearted examination of Islam and a taut thriller. Ultimately, it satisfies neither goal, and it takes what feels like an eternity doing (or not doing) it. It did so little to hold my attention that it took me five separate sittings to make it through the film... and I have a long attention span. Two stars for the acting and the aspirations of the movie, but there's not enough to merit a third star. I remember the trailers for the film and wondered where it went. Now I know why its theatrical run was so brief."
4,Some say trator but to Islam or USA,"So many reviews read like the stars or produces wrote them. They give them high marks, then write a two page glowing synopsis of the story. I feel to review a film what is needed is to try to clearly state what is good and what could be improved.That being said, I feel this was a great movie, with great acting with lots of ""action"" mental and some violent. It had a good story line, great acting with ""you better pay attention twists and turns"". I found no faults but would like to have had the woman/wife/girl friend character developed further and use that to make a really happy ending. What he will do next is left to your imagination.DOES ANYONE OTHER THAN ME READ THESE. LET ME KNOW WITH FEEDBACK IF YOU CAN."
5,Traitor by Brandon M. Moskos,"Great movie. Don Cheadle is as excellent as ever. I'm a serious movie guy and everything works in this movie. Great acting, story, and plot. Please watch, you won't regret it."
4,Is He or Isn't He?,"A traitor that is. I guess it depends on your perspective but since I'm not a terrorist I will say that he isn't a traitor after all. This movie was great to watch, kept me guessing, and I really felt for the character that Cheadle plays. The best part of this movie is that the terrorists get what they deserve and this ""traitor"" is the one who orchestrates it."
4,"Good Movie , Bad Digital Copy","Good movie, but the Digital Copy does not work on the Mac. Sad but true."

2,Not as good as I thought,"Huge fan of Don Cheadle, but even he couldn't make this movie less of a snore fest."
1,Yawn,"Some might not agree, but I thought this movie was one of the most boring movies of the year. Every movie I have ever seen with Don Cheadle has been terrible. I turned Traitor off about halfway through as it was like watching paint dry."
3,Digital Copy,It's a really good movie but I found the digital copy will not transfer to my PC. There ia also no support reference for the digital copy like with other movie studios. It's usually printed on the disk or the included paper inside the cover but nothing with this movie. I have searched and searched the net trying to find a solution but no success so far.
3,Ho-hum thriller,The Bottom Line:Traitor displays a level of intelligence that's welcome in such genre entries but that unfortunately doesn't counter the fact that as a whole the film is uninvolved and often slow; I respect the efforts made by all parties involved but Traitor is not really a movie I'm glad I saw.2.5/4
5,Excellent performance by Don Cheadle,"This thriller doesn't focus on explosions and car chases. Instead, it focuses on religion and fanaticism and the negative stereotypes of Islam, and it does a hell of a job, too. It kept me interested from start to finish. But what I like most about this movie is Don Cheadle's performance. He's believable in every shot he's in, especially when he interacts with the FBI and the Agent Clayton (Peaarce) and Omar (Taghmaoui). His acting as a whole is what makes this film a whole lot better. Jeff Daniels was a bit underused in my opinion, but he does a decent job playing his part. And finally, the minimal Middle Eastern music creates the perfect atmosphere for this film. Kudos to Mark Kilian for the score. In fact, kudos to the entire cast and crew for making this movie.Grade: A-"
3,Not what I expected,"I didn't know that much at all when I picked up this film, but after watching it, I'm glad I made the choice. You can't really discuss this film without giving anything away-and there are some confusing aspects about it in general but overall it was a pretty cool suspence/action film. Don Cheadle gives a decent performance as a devoutly religious man who it seems has taken up with terrorists in the Middle East. The film actually takes you across the world to different countries where events take place that all lead up to the interesting climax. I can't really say it was that predictable but it wasn't completely inventive either. I think it's better if you don't know too much going into it-I'm glad I didn't since it all seemed that more mysterious."
3,Huh ?,"In the final scene of this movie, there is a line, ""Do you know that the Koran says that if you take a life, it is like you have killed all mankind, but if you save a life, it is like you have saved all mankind"" ? I find it kind of extraordinary that the makers of this movie didn't know that that comes from the Jewish holy book (Talmud), and not the Koran. And I also find it a bit incredible that no one in Hollywood knew that. That very same line was in the move ""Shindler's List"", and most of this movie is lifted from far better films. This movie is entertaining in the way ""24"" is, but is far more politically correct, too, and is very derivative."
3,"Very good movie, but poor blu-ray quality","The movie itself is great, the 3 stars go to blu-ray quality, for a brand new movie I'm bit disappointed, scenes with grainy images was 1/4 to 1/3 of the movie, even on day time shots. The blu-ray James Bond movies from 60's are amazing and Traitor from 2008 it's poor to average(image quality wise)."
3,One of the few notable movies on terrorism,"Okay the movie is good. I do not know why I neglected watching the movie after having it for such a long time in my list. Don Cheadle gives a good performance, Guy Pierce acts well. A movie about terrorism and you get the mandatory foreign locations, the villains and some America bashing. I recommend it, if you like a fast paced movie experience. It is also a different take on terrorism after the influx of these movies after 9/11."
3,Poor bus driver - spoilers below,"SPOILERS BELOWHeck, the only real loser in this movie was the unlucky bus driver who was exploded to pieces along with the thirty terrorists...As for the film itself, it's good, nothing spectacular, but good."
4,An Almost Great Political Thriller,"TRAITOR would be a great film with about 15 minutes removed from the first half. It starts off a bit slow, without the pacing the story needs.However, there are a couple GREAT twists to it (that I won't give away, even though the trailer gives away one). These redeem it.Don Cheadle is very good. It is his film and he more than carries it.The DVD has a couple short featurettes about the making of the film. There is also an audio commentary.If you enjoy political thrillers, this is a better, more intelligent film than the BOURNE films. It could have been a great one. Now, it is just a very good one."
2,Jason,It Was really nice for about three weeks then it broke. and its been in the drawer ever since. better spend more money and buy one that wont break.
4,Very Satisfied,"Bracelet has large links and looks great. The only advice that I have is that if you choke the chain up for a smaller size that you remove the extra link. If you don't, the clasp will open and you will loose the chain. I lost my first one. This is my second purchase. Obviously I like it."
5,Cooper Bracelet,"This bracelet is exactly like you see in the picture, thick, well-worked metal, is strong, its closure is quite safe, I like it"
1,Don't think this is real copper,"Also, the clasp is horrible. I've never seen a clasp like this before. It is difficult to work with and usually works itself open. I should have known from the price it wasn't real copper, but since the title is copper bracelet, not copper look bracelet, I guess I thought lying was false advertising and therefore illegal. What do I know I guess."
3,Not exactly as I pictured it would be.,I was expecting a finish that wasn't so shiny. It could be coated with something and I was wanting a natural copper bracelet for health reasons.
4,Big!,"if you have tiny wrists you may want to look elsewhere. I do and this will fall off if I'm not careful but I just hike it up on my forearm and its fine. This is well made and heavy duty, more for a man than a woman, but I like it."
2,no effect on aches and pains,Absolutely no effect on aches and pains. I've been wearing it non-stop for a couple weeks and have noticed nothing expcept more pain but can't blame that on this copper bracelet. It looks OK.
1,fishing with john dvd,"Without doubt the worst,most disgusting effort at producing a fishing video i have ever had the misfortune to view,an absolute disgrace to fishing.I simply cannot put into words the disdain i have for this tripe"
1,"WHAT A LOUSY, LOUSY CAMERA!","I bought this to replace my Fuji A201, which is beginning to fail me. I shopped for a camera with all the same features at a price I could afford, and this seemed to be the ticket. When I received it, I began taking a whole lot of test pictures to learn it's specific finctions. Every photo I took looked fabulous on the camera's LCD screen.Then I uploaded them to my computer.Every photo came out blurry, off-color, and darker than they should have been. Using the zoom made things worse--the more I zoomed, the blurrier the resulting shot. I took a picture of a patch of lilies that, when I looked at it on the computer, weren't even recognizable as flowers. I've gotten better pictures from a generic, throw-away, 35mm camera with out-of-date film.So I'm back in the market for a replacement camera. You can bet that I won't be buying another Vivitar."
3,Not as pictured,"I ordered a NCAA 3 X 5 Florida Gators flag, and on the picture of the shown item, it showed ""GATORS"" down the side, however, when I got the product, it showed ""FLORIDA"" down the side. Not a huge deal, I know, it just wasn't as it was pictured, so, I'm a little skeptical on what I'm really going to get if I continue to order from these sites. Is anything what it claims to be? All i have to go on is a picture, and when thats not even accurate, I'm a little leery. Happy-but-un-satisfied"
5,Great item!,After doing much research on fishing rods for my 8 and 10 year old boys the ugly stick was the one to buy! Great and sturdy item for two rugged boys.
4,Great product,I recieved very very quick shipping on this fishing pole and would recommend the Ugly Stick to any fisher.
1,not worth buying,"This second (current) workout is almost useless - you do not feel stretching or anything, all done in a sitting position - like for seniors or handicapped people. The first one, that it is not sold anymore, was much better even though very limited too. I just added my own routine with the same breathing technique."
4,Very well written,"I totally loved the ending of this book. It held my attention throughout and it was full of surprises. From the very beginning and throughout, I never would have guessed the storyline."
1,"NOT ""La Tropa Vallenata""","I ordered this CD, and while the sticker from spun.com claims that this is an album by La Tropa Vallenata, it is apparently either by a group called ""Fiesta Vallenata"" or a various-artists collection.Do not order this CD if you're looking for an album by La Tropa Vallenata. I give one star because it has no indication that it is by La Tropa Vallenata. The song ""Los Caminos de la Vida"" is on this CD might be the version by La Tropa Vallenata (it is very close in length to their version), but there's no musician credits on the cover other than ""Fiesta Vallenata"".Since I plan to return it, I have not removed the shrink wrap, so I can't say whether the music is good.A good starting point for La Tropa Vallenata is ""Los Caminos de la Vida."" The albums ""Cumbia de los Pobres"" and ""Cumbias de mi Tierra"" are also very good."
2,not very good,"the nose trimmer works well, but the electric razor not well at all. Does not cut at all. I would suggest the nose trimmer but not the razor. the cost was a little high for the product."
2,Lost wisdom,"T. S. Eliot asked,""Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?""This unintentionally bleak commentary on the state of psychological research will not help you locate any answers."
2,No satisfecha,"Hola, nunca me he puesto la pulsera, porque se oscurecio enseguida, no me agrado el producto... Es una pena xq me parecio hermosa cuando la vi..."
2,Good friends are hard to find.,This book did not meet my expectations and the solutions to problems( such as bullying and social anxiety) were too simplified. I do not think that it will be helpful to my grandchild.
3,Not for children with autism?,"I just only got this book and haven't finished reading it but was a little put off by the intro in this book that states, ""this book will not help the child with autism, who is in his own world, or the child with general delays in learning, motor and social behavior."" I bought this book specifically to help my autistic son (who although highly functioning is autistic nevertheless) and was a little offended by the author's assumption that an autistic child is ""in his own world"". So if you are a parent looking to help your autistic child in the social arena, perhaps you might want to look elsewhere."
2,This is what happens when you rush to market a DVD,"El Cid should be one of those sprawling epics which fill a surround sound set-up in a manner consistent with Spartacus, Lawrence of Arabia, Braveheart, etc. However, with the production of this version apparently mass produced in China, we have a so-so release of a great epic. Advertized as 5.1 audio, it's really more mono, and some 2.0 with a hint of 5.1 in a battle scene. The clarity of the movie is somewhat better than fair, but sadly, it doesn't rank up there with the other epics which have been remastered with painstaking care. It's obvious there was not much attention paid to the digital process with this release. ...and, oh yeah, the Christians beat the Moors again in this movie."
4,Ghetto sound!,Mr. Cheeks exactly how I want to hear him! Lost Boyz musicstyle! Grimey lyrics. Nice cd and booklet! Great for my collection!
4,Classic '80s music,"Best of The Jets is one of those hard-to-find CDs that includes hits from the '80s. Once forgotten, songs, like ""You've Got It All Over Him,"" brings you back to the day when puppy love was just as much an issue to you as the pimples on your face. The group, who, in actuality, are brothers and sisters, didn't last very long, but they did manage to break into the charts with a few songs that have since become popular among the easy listening crowd. Some of them are still played on the radio. I bought the CD once, a long time ago, but lost it. I haven't been able to find it anywhere except for here, at amazon.com, and for an extremely low price. For those that are into ""greatest hits"" CDs, this is a great one to have."
5,Classic 80's pop!!!!,"This is one of my favorite pop groups of the 1980's and I still enjoy their music today they had some of the best songs I liked them they dressed nice and I liked their dance moves . My favorites are: Crush on You, You Got It All, make it real, rocket 2 u, Cross my broken heart and others!!!! If you like 80's new wave music then I would recommend that you buy this cd!!!"
2,pretty average,most of these songs were catchy at the time but haven't dated all that well.Rocket 2 u still sounds good.but they got caught up on the sappy side.the grooves were tight.when the Brothers of the group took over vocals the songs sounded twice as better.
5,The Miracle of Saint Nicholas,"Marvellous book and illustration. It explains poignantly the truth of where ""Santa Clause"" originated. It is no tale. Saint Nicholas was a real ordinary man who became a great priest of God and Saint by doing ordinary things extraordinarily well for the glory of God."
1,SOUVENIR T-SHIRT,"In the product description section they should have stated an INFANT T-shirt... I ordered this for my teenage girl, and the shirt, size M is for a 2 years old skinny girl. Can you beleive it? It was so dissapointing to her!!! CD is fine, also the buttons; but the shirt is not for an RBD fan!!!"
5,The League Of Nations,"As you watch the current United Nations trying to help out people all over the world, I wonder how many of today's younger people remember the original League of Nations? It was built after World War I in order to keep world wars from happening again. Obviously it didn't work out as well as planned, but it was a good start to living in peace. I remember being a small child and hearing about the League of Nations, so I was interested in listening to this CD and hearing the orignal speaches and such that went into trying to build a lasting peace. I am surprised at how good the sound quality is here given the age of the recordings."
5,Good Sound Quality,"What you hear is what you get. These are a collection of speaches given by Wilson and FDR and other leaders when radio was just starting out.It's obvious that Wilson didn't really understand how to use the media to get his message across by that FDR knew what had to be done in order to engage the listener.The speaches about the League of Nations are the most historically imporant, but I also like Wilson's WWI talks.The sound quality is great."
1,in pieces already,"so the day this bell arrived i put it on the counter. my daughter got home from school picked it up and the next thing i know, it has been taken apart and some of the smaller pieces already lost. don't bother."
2,Bell Breaks easily,"I have now bought 3 of these bells. Daughter learning to ride bike and drops it sometimes still. The bell bursts into pieces after hard fall. Unless your kid is very careful on setting bike up on kick stand, etc, you will likely see breakage in a short while (whole housing comes apart)."
1,Fell apart before I could give it to my daughter.,"This is horribly built. I can't believe that Disney has there name on such a poorly constructed item.I bought this to go with a new bike for my daughter. After assembling the bike, I attached it to the handle bars. I then carried it out to my garage to fill up the tires. When I brought it back inside for wrapping, my arm brushed the bell. This in turn caused the bell portion to fly off, and the inside gears to go every where. One gear was never seen again, and rendered the bell useless. My daughter never even got to see it."
4,Flower Designs by Mandy Southan,"The designs are very good and can be used for lots of different crafts. The black line masters could be enlarged or reduced in size to suit many projects e.g, glass painting, embroidery, applique, machine embroidery, cross stitch, stencil printing and more. They can be a starting point for individualising the design to your own needs by adding the flower designs together to make interesting and creative work."
3,"okay, but not great","I like this book, but it's not up to Mandy's usual top notch style. It's on the simple side."
4,Many Flower Designs,This book has designs that can easily be used for quilt piecing or fusing. I needed ideas for a baby quilt and wall hanging where another person wanted to pick the design ahead of time (instead of my usual make it up as I go along) and it's worked very well.
2,"Tenchi ""copycat""","I would give this series a 2 1/2 or 3 1/2 stars.It copycated the Tenchi series.Not only that ,but it also copycated both the shows humor and the females fighting over males bit.I'm not entirely into the show ,but I'll admit Iv'e seen worse anime shows these days than this one."
4,Great! (While it Lasted.),"The title of this review pretty much says it all. Warren Buffett presents his thoughts on investing well, delivering each point with a quip or two sure to make you laugh. But, the tape is over as soon as it begins--and you have not really learned anything new. (Not if you have read one of the many books on or letters by Mr. Buffett at least.)"
4,Great Toy,"I watch the show and my daughter loves the character so I bought this, it doesn't really have educational value, it is meant to be fun."
5,"good value, great tool","I got this drill to make holes inside walls for electrical wire runs. This is a great tool and the refurb job is just like new. I used a paddle bit to get the job done, but make sure to purchase a self-feeding bit. Two speeds are forward/reverse. The top of the drill states made in the USA, I am assuming the whole drill is, not just the gearbox? I dropped the drill and it just dented the floor, not the drill. Well built. Very loud, and be sure to watch out for snags while using, because the drill has torque and will pull you around in a circle if you don't let go."
4,milwaukee right angle drill,"This drill has been great. It was a factory-reconditioned drill, but I wouldn't have been able to tell except for the stickers that said so. No dings or scratches on this drill when it came. I did have to change the 90 degree attachment around because it was on the faster setting and I wanted the slower setting. That wasn't to easy because I couldn't remove the chuck. I had to take it to a motor repair shop where they removed the chuck fairly easy because they have the right tools. And they didn't charge me. But as far as the drill works, it is great. Very happy with the drill and the price compared to brand new."
3,"decent book and movie, but not a good source for inforation on training or problem solving","I thought it was very slow and boring at times. The information was not good for all dogs, and didnt cover any problem solving or various ways of training. I train dogs, and this was all very novice material. I was hoping for new ways to train dogs with information on training the ""hard to train"" dogs to be service dogs."
5,A MUST SEE!!!!!!!,"I haven't seen this DVD yet as I just ordered it for Christmas but sooooo many friends of mine who are disabled like I am highly recommend the TeamWork Series, they say both the books and videos are GREAT teaching tools. I look forward to watching this DVD as I have the Teamwork1 VHS and can't wait to get my Doberman Takkera and train her for Service Dog work"
3,service dog training II,"For what it gave me it was worth reading, but I feel it didn't go far enough one specific training."
1,This wont help you train your dog,This video is no help at all. It doesn't really show you how to train the dog anything. It was pretty lame. Would not recomend this to anybody wanting to train their dog.
1,What is Wrong with You People?,"I can't believe that they would show this awful episode after Journey to Babel. Why would the Federation be dealing with a people who haven't developed light speed? These people haven't even developed the bow and arrow! Despite this huge mistake, the rest of the episode is painful to watch."
1,Nothing but trouble,"I'll be short and to the point: my initial order was screwed up: instead of colored cartridges I was sent a black one, so I had to re-order. The re-order was shipped correctly, but the cartridges suck - they don't print any colors, although the printer reads them as full."
1,Read all the details!,"Amazon yet again shows you're ordering one thing and ships something different! This is not a 4 (FOUR) pack as shown or described! I ordered this expecting a four pack of four separate color ink cartridges...nope, not what is in my package! This is a 3 pack! WTF! No black ink...and as all the Epson users out there know, you cannot run your printer with one cartridge empty. Amazon yet again disappoints, no wonder it was only $32...but then today the price is less! SO FRUSTRATING. I should just buy a new printer, it would probably be less expensive in the long run and less frustrating...but I certainly won't be buying it on Amazon."
1,DRY INK!,I ordered 6 cartridges for an older Epson c84 printer that I use with some of my students on art projects.I NEED them now.So far 3 are dried out of 6 total.I want my money back........... No answer from the company.
2,disappointed,where is the BLACK? unable to use without black. did not understand the description black not included. everyone needs black!!!!!!
5,Excellent Service,"I ordered replacement inkjet cartridges for a computer printer and received excellent service from this seller. The item was very cost-competitive, and was shipped within a reasonable time, just as promised. I highly recommend the seller for this product."
1,Epson cartridge system is a rip-off,"I got a C84 ""free"" with a laptop, so I thought I had a good deal.Be aware that the printer will *not* print if *any* of the cartridges is empty (and this means empty according to the printer, which you have no control over).Say one color runs out and you want to keep printing in B&W; only? you can't!I understand that printer manufacturers don't want us to use generic cartridges because poor ink quality may clog heads, thus causing undue customer returns, but this tie-in to multiple cartridge purchase is a rip-off. If you have the choice, don't get any printer that forces you into such a deal."
1,CX4600 Epson Printer and Ink CArtridges,"I've had Epson C82, C84 and CX 4600 Printers and they ""ALL"" have the same problems = INK CATRIDGES that don't work or tell me the right amount is left in the Cartridge! Printer dies due to Ink Cartridge failures!Robert F."
1,3 Pound Ink Cartridges???,"The title of this item is for an ""Ink Cartridge"" but then goes on to also have ""Multi-Pack"". Picture is no help since it shows a single cartridge. And don't even think that you can figure out if you are getting one each of cyan/yellow/magenta from the shipping weight of 9 pounds. That would make a single ink cartridge if it is a pack of three, 3 pounds. Don't think my CX6400 printer can handle 9 pounds of ink.Really wished some items would list only the manufacture's product number and nothing else..well maybe a link to the manufacture's website to cross reference to see which one to buy."
3,A Must Have For Ronstadt Fans!,"As a fan of Linda Ronstadt, I consider this film to be a ""must have"" simply for the extensive concert footage of her music from the 1970's. The film is harmless fun itself, and the music is memorable for those of us who were teenagers in the 70's."
3,Why does this cost so much??? My rating is adjusted low because of same...,"I truly enjoyed this film when it came out, thus, I kept looking for it on Amazon. I was excited when it finally came under the ""notify me"" category, but at this price? No way will I purchase this.Can anyone explain just why the price is so high on this DVD release?Thanks in advance![ because the flick is great, it's a 4+ star...but the price is prohibitive so I give it a 0 because I won't even consider to purchase it at this price. Splitting the difference is a 2+ which I'll round up...dang !!! ]"
4,"Campy, but fun","And the music, one of the best compilations of 70s-era classic rock, is an added bonus. Though it inspired the long-running TV sitcom WKRP, as other reviewers have pointed out, I wouldn't try to make comparisons between the two...anymore than you can compare the movie ""Mash"" with its TV counterpart. This flick stands alone, and for anyone who savors the music of that generation, I highly recommend it. What ""Animal House"" was to college fraternities, ""FM"" is to rock 'n roll radio...back when there were DJs and request lines."
4,Great Movie. Classic late 70's.,Bought on VHS since i couldn't find the DVD at least at an affordable price.
4,a realistic look at 70s radio,"this movie will take you back to when rock music came into being.. it takes me back to when i was in late elementary-early jr. high school listing to my little am radio that would sit in the palm of my hand. music like the EAGLES and STEELY DAN, are really timless. if you look in the background, notice all the posters of the then really poupular musicians.. its a real precious little time-capsul that will take you back to when music wasnt gothic,or grunge. give it a try, and reminice where you were in the 70's at that time.. to bad we cant go back to some of the concerts they show. the buffet concert would have been wild!"
3,"No Static At All....Unless You Want This On DVD, That Is..","Based on the rivalry between Los Angeles radio stations KMET and KLOS, this movie is the perfect representation of life at a radio station in the late 70's, and a must-have if you're the least bit into radio. It also has one of the best soundtracks around.That being said, have the sellers of this flick lost their everlovin' minds!?! A hundred sixty-six bucks for a movie I found in the five dollar bin at Wal-Mart!?! A DVD with practically no extras whatsoever!?! I'm as big a fan of this movie as you're likely to find, but give me a freakin' break! The only thing you vultures are doing is driving folks to the bootleggers!Somebody please tell me it's a glitch and that decimal point is supposed to be one spot to the left."
3,Madonna Costume...eh,"This costume is as good as the little bit of money you will pay for it. It is a good foundation piece, but needs some additional help to be worth wearing. The skirt is very see through and needs more toole added to it."
3,HUH?,"While the writing was beautiful and the characters haunting the plot was only almost there. It's like the author had an idea of what he wanted to convey but no real story to convey it with. I read the whole thing but was left wanting much more of an explanation or of an ending. Don't think I would recommend this book to anyone, this was a very good ""rough"" draft but really the story was just missing?"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Jane Austen meets Charles Dickens, with magic electricity by gaslight. Very dull. The drama and conflict is very understated, not enough for me to care. Read Perdido Street Station, instead. There is a good hearted thief, a researcher, a bit of political journalism, but very tame, all in all, very forgettable."
2,"Beautiful writing, but very slow","In spite of my only chosing 2 stars for the book, I can see why ""The Light Ages"" was chosen for the World Fantasy Award. Macleod obviously is an experienced and careful writer, and his depictions of the town of Bracebridge and the lives of the people there are so well done that I could almost see the individuals he described.That said, though, I was not able to finish the book because the action is so slow moving. Macleod loves his descriptions of the people and the work of removing aether from the ground, but he spends so much time on those depictions that the narrative just creeps along. I finally gave up, even though I enjoyed reading about the world Macleod was creating, because I felt it was taking too long to get to the action."
3,Rich and Dense as Devil's Food,"The Light Ages is an apt parable for any age. It deals with the dream and destruction of revolution, the hope and futility of regime change. Don't look here for optimism or unsullied motive and means. Robert Borrows, the protaganist, moves through a dark England and the darkness of his own needs and justifications. The language is the only enduring beauty. The central mystery is more a deceit upon which the author weaves his world than a motive force for resolution."
4,Difficult but Rewarding,"No two ways about it: this is a hard book to read. On the other hand, though, the beauty of the prose and the author's ideas make it worth your trouble. The story itself is also fairly interesting, and the slow pace seems suited to the setting and subject. Save this one for when you have a bit of time to get into it, and you'll enjoy reading it."
3,Restricted Carter Family,"The Carter Family / The Country Music Hall of Fame Series (single CD): While the Carter Family is a hall of fame group, this single CD only covers some of their songs from 1936 to 1938. The songs here are all Great, but at only 16 songs, from such a restricted time period, this is neither their greatest hits nor their best 16 songs. However, the songs that ARE here sound fantastic.Three Stars (3 )"
1,Poor quality prints,"I recently purchased a refurbished HP Photosmart 335.The printer was easy to select the pictures. The image quality looked nice, but the pictures smeared very easily. Any amount of moisture will ruin the picture. The paper feed mechanism was a little clumsy and was hard to tell how far to insert or slide the photo stock.At 24 cents a photo, I would not waste my time on this printer. I returned mine the very next day."
2,Photosmart,I bought a new one and then I ordered a refurbished one. The both print very well. But in both printers the paper feed broke. So I can't use either one.
5,Good price,"Strong sturdy glasses, all three the same. You can three for the price of 1 in most cases. Comes in a nice little plastic tube for storage. Having multiple measurment types is a great plus. Basically a little bigger than a standard shot glass, but the same style."
5,what fun!,"A previous reviewer had it right: difficult, confusing at times, but right on. I have the advantage of having visited Hungary for a total of 3+ months, so have some understanding of some things. Studying this book, which is carefully titrated in its introduction of new elements of the language, has been wonderful--answering my questions about it in an orderly way. I use the CDs on my computer so I can easily go back to a section and repeat it. I notate in the book where the accompanying CD sections are and I keep a separate sheet--sort of a table of contents for the CDs. Otherwise I would feel very lost in associating the book and the CDs together. So there are demands made on the user, but it is well worth it."
2,"Very detailed, but hard to learn from","I bought this book/cd set when I was trying to learn Hungarian prior to a trip to Hungary. It is similar to other language textbooks which teach you grammar, but I thought it was difficult to stick with for an independant study. If you are only trying to learn conversational hungarian (like me) this is not the book for you. You have to listen and follow in the book at the same time. I was wanting something I could listen to and learn from without having to follow along in a book. I felt like I was back in college doing homework. I did not find this as easy to use as other CDs I bought."
3,Plastic Bubbles,"These bubbles were fun for a day, but popped easily and were not colorful like shown in the advertisement. It was something new for the kids to try. If it were any more expensive, I probably would not have purchased them. I do not think I will buy them again, but was fun to try once."
5,My Father is Estel Myers and my hero,"Belly of the Beast is a good history lesson for those who never knew how the p.o.w.s suffered at the hands of the enemy. I was happy to see the author stated facts from information she obtained and now the truth about the war is out and not sugar coated . Although this is a great tribute to my father, I pray that people will realize that our freedoms are not free. That my father and other great men paid a high price for our country and for us. This author did a great justice to all the men and women of WW2!"
3,not really new,"The book was advertised as new, but though it may have not been read, the pages are darkened and there is a black marker line on bottom of book. As I bought it for a Christmas present, I am disappointed. It should have given details of these things and displayed as ""used"" - good to very good."
1,The Worst Book Ever,I speak from the perspective of someone who has known several Philippine POWs and have read extensively on this subject. This book is so full of inaccuracies it is not worth anyone's time to read it. There are hundreds of better books out there on the subject. Save your money!
3,Why not?,"Obviously this stand is cool. Why else would it be backordered everywhere???You'll be amazed for the first few hours....then it kinda wears down, but at least it takes up a little less room, and it's MUCH MUCH MUCH better than the horizontal one."
2,Pointless,"Why spend [money] on something that does NOTHING for you except possibly make your PS2 look better. The PS2 is in no danger of falling over when it in horizontal, so whats the point of putting it verticle, now you controller ports detract from the look even more than having it horizontal. Spend this [money] towards a new game."
1,i have a better way....,"i put the PS2 lying horizontally! thats right, i didn't waste 15 bucks on a stand, which makes it hard to put in games....why spend 15 for a product that makes the PS2 worse?"
2,Waste of money,"Why would you need this. I just lean mine againts my TV and several stacked books, and it works fine. This is a waste of money. Its just another useless product Sony uses to suck the money out of your pockets."
4,Awesome Stand,Gamer from Dallas. This stand is the best ever. If you don't have one you should buy the coolest stand ever.
3,Stand in awe of its...vertical-ness . . .,"Many reviewers are right on the money with their sense of bafflement at the existence of this shiny blue and black contraption. I bought it when I had to stick my working PS2, (my first one rolled over and died), when space in my office was at a premium and since I am rather klutzy at times, anything that kept it safe(r) could only be a good thing. Except for making a vertical Playstation 2 harder to tip over, it does nothing. It looks good, it's standy-ness cannot be denied. I can't wait for the Playstation 3 wall mount adapter or the ceiling mobile adapter or maybe an attractive PS3 hat ensemble. Sony is obviously preceding with the concept of `if you make it, they'll buy it."", which leads me to the horizontal stand... a beveled piece of blue and black plastic which sits under your PS2, now that makes no sense- who would buy such a thing!?! Oh... right..."
1,Great way to Screw up your PS2!,"Please don't do this to your PS2 and your games. Sony put these out without really researching them first, I feel. A DVD player isn't meant to read in that orientation so its much easier for the laser to slip out of alignment, and worse yet to scratch your games."
4,Great Product but Overpriced!,"I have been using this product ever since I have my Ps2 and it does not scratch my disks. This thing saves a lot of space if you have larger systems like X-Box all in the same room, especially if you have to squeeze a little.But the downer about this product is that it is overpriced. I got mine assembled with my Ps2 for free and now that I look at it it is way overpriced. A price of about 5 dollars is reasonable. So, if you need space, buy this stand. if you need money, do not buy this stand!"
4,Nice... however,"The PS2 vertical stand was working great with all of my games. However, some of my DVD movies started skipping and I had to put it back horizontally. When I put it back horizontally, the movie did not skip as much or at all. I suppose this is a warning to some PS2 owners. I'll just keep it for now, but I won't use it anymore."
5,This Is Cool,I like this.It's cool. The color matches the colors of the PS2. PS2 looks awesome when it's vertical. But I've never had it horizantal. So it might look better.
5,It's really very simple.....,"I'm all for debates, but let's break it down. Before buying this stand, just ask yourself one question. Do you (for whatever reason) need to be able to stand your PS2 vertically? If the answer is yes, go for it. In my experience, using this product will not harm your system, scratch your games, cause your PS2 to tip easily, or cause you any trouble. If you are content to have a horizontal PS2, that's fine too. You obviously don't need this item."
5,And you know this...,"The PS2 vertical stand is not a deathtrap for CDs or DVDs...I watched DVDs without any skipping and although I smacked my PS2 a few times by accident nothing happened to the game CDs. Besides looking cool, the stand is surprisingly sturdy. The PS2 will not shake within the stand.....It will move with the stand since it is held pretty tightly...It's worth buying....Let me put it this way, if you're planning on buying a stand, buy the vertical stand..."
5,More Classic Classical Guitar,"This eighth of the nine ""Legendary Andres Segovia"" volumes on MCA Classics features the music of Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco. The disc is divided between the ten delicate, quiet, introspective pieces that comprise ""Platero and I,"" and the brisk, up-tempo, dynamic guitar quintet, featuring the strings of the Quintetto Chigiano. The disc concludes with ""Tonadilla For Guitar On The Name Of Andres Segovia,"" a sublime conclusion to a terrific collection. All nine of these Segovia volumes are outstanding, and will serve as an excellent introduction to this guitar virtuoso, and classical music in general."
3,As creepy as Candyman music.,The score to this little film by Philip Glass is more low key but often just as creepy as the Candyman soundtrack with eerie use of children's voices.Unlike the Candyman soundtrack however this one has more variety though nothing big of the Naqoyqatsi variety.Because Glass's style is so distinctive chances are if you've liked any movie score by him you'll like this one too.It lacks the emotional pianowork of The Hours but succeeds in creating a dark troubling atmosphere.Not to all tastes but still satisfying and spooky.
5,emotional,"The music is beautiful, with passages that bring the listener to an emotional climax. Probably, it should be even better when accompanied by images. Nevertheless, it tells us a story."
3,not the whole story,"This book gives a general overview of Indian astrology but mostly concentrates on the nakshastras, the moon signs. It does not go into the actual charting methods, such as the differences between the N. and S. Indian charts. Fun and accessible, but it misses a LOT of the astrological picture."
1,Stik Tak doesn't stick at all,Tried to hang a simple paper poster on the wall. Fell down hours later no matter how much tak we used. Terrible. Useless.
3,Just ok.......,"I have found that Chicago knives are either hit or miss depending on the knife style.This is not their greatest,but for the money it isnt bad I suppose."
3,Good value,"I continue to be impressed with the overall quality of this particular line of World Knives/Chicago Cutlery.I had bought the Chef's knife as a single item some years ago and should have bought a full set when they were still available.I added the utility knife and the paring knife this year. I do feel these are the best bang for the buck in low cost, intregal bolster knives.The steel is decent quality and the edges can be refined easily. Some may be dissapointed with the factory edge but those that know sharpening will not have a problem at all. If I did not already own a good slicing knife, that would be another I would buy in a heartbeat. The Sankuto looks trendy but honestly, if one can't get the job done with the Chef, Utility and Parer, they probably have a drawer full of unused knives."
5,the one that drew blood,"very sharp knife, I used it to finish opening a can that a can opener messed up and the knife slipped and cut my thumb. The wound was deep and clean characteristic of a sharp knife. Yeah I know, it was a dumb thing to do."
2,"Good premise, poor execution","Stock characters and trite dialogue -- very disappointing, considering the subject matter. I had every reason to like this book, as I work at Stanford myself; study Scots Gaelic and all things Celtic. I think the author's background in the romance genre is glaring -- hopefully if this does turn into a trilogy, Hanna will drop the ""by the numbers/formula"" style of writing and make more of an effort to develop genuine characters who say things as unique and real as the situations they are involved in."
3,Not quite sure what she was doing here....,"""The Starry Child"" tells the story of Rainey Nielsen and her daughter Sasha, a troubled eight-year-old who has not spoken a word since her father died several years earlier. Although an interesting premise, this book never really came together for me - was it science fiction, fantasy, or just fiction? The characters were a little too stock- the beleaguered mother, the troubled daughter and the handsome professor who will make it all better; not to mention the fact that the evil Bad Guys were so evil, I'm surprised they weren't wearing black hats. On the plus side, the book contained a few nice bits, the plot was unusual, and the ending definitely had an interesting twist. Fair, but not great."
2,"Good Premise, diasappointing execution","I would have every reason to like this book, as it correlates closely to my own life: I work at Stanford, I study Scots Gaelic and all things Celtic, and I have traveled many times to the Highland locales in the book..... So, imagine my disappointment when all the characters are painfully stock, all the dialogue is trite (yes, even the Gaelic bits), and the potential of the great fantasy line of the story is swamped in every romance cliche imaginable.This could have been truly riveting, given the subject matter, but the execution was far below the mark. Hopefully, in the rest of the trilogy, Hanna will develop the potential of her characters and storyline in a more skillful manner."
2,kattywatty,I thought this book was sort of draggy. I read about half and couldn't keep going. It seems like a lot of unnecessary dialog to me. I wont finish this book. Someone likened this book like Dianna Gabledoon (sp). Don't see it myself!
1,definitely not a diana gabaldon,This book was not anywhere near the quality of Diana Gabaldon's historical fiction.To me the plot was not believable in the least.
1,so sad,"johnny osbourne is one of my favorite reggae artists, but his later stuff is really awful. its full of techno instruments that detract from any of the natural feel, a syncopated beat that bores, and really lack any quality control in terms of track selection.get the best of johnny osbourne and various other heartbeat/studio one albums and skip this one."
4,Excellent,"Schoch and West build an overwhelming case for the great antiquity of the Sphinx, predating the other monuments of Giza. I highly recommend this video, and even moreso Schoch's book ""Voices of the Rocks"". Another book (orig 1986/87, but out in a Jan 2000 edition) that will be of interest is ""Plato, Prehistorian"" by Mary Settegast. Schoch mentions it in his book, and I sought out the old edition in a local library.The only problem with this video is the segment near the end featuring Richard Hoagland. Even that was good for some laughs. In his defense, the ""Face on Mars"" used to exist, but only as an artifact of the Viking orbiter cameras' resolution. The Pathfinder data wasn't available when this show was produced. OTOH, Hoagland hasn't abandoned his mistaken conclusion in the face of the better data."
2,An Amalgam,"This book is an amalgam of bits and pieces and techniques and strategies from other books about creative thinking on the market. If the reader has read very little in the field, then this book might at least be a start."
5,boysenberries,this product was received in 3 days afer ordering. I was so pleased that it arrived before Christmas. Very excellent service!
4,Boysenberry lust,"I always could find Boysenberries when living in Hawaii, but they are harder to find here in New England. People used to carry the canned, but no more. I am very grateful that Amazon makes them available. My granddaughter and I made my husband his favorite pie last week. The berries arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I used the recipe on the back of the label. Superb! I only gave them four stars as they are canned and not fresh. Way better than nothing."
3,Badly damaged cans,3 out of 8 cans unusable due to can damage. Damage did not seem to occur in transit as box intact and well supported. Please check cans before mailing as look as though they were dropped prior to packaging. Similar problem with the gooseberries.
1,"Wrong description, doesn't match phone","Really frustrating, the description said that it would fit my model of phone. But it was not the right one and did not fit at all. I won't even bother returning it because I've paid so much in shipping and would have to pay shipping again to send it back. Really disappointing and I don't think I'll buy another battery through amazon because of the incorrect information."
1,DEAD BATTERY,"The battery arrived in a timely manner, but would not charge up at all. It's not worth the money to return, so I feel cheated."
4,An enjoyable set of modern Club/Dance songs,"Volume 11 of the ""Gay Happening"" compilation series is enjoyable. The best songs are either Disco influenced songs such as ""I'm Coming Out"" and ""Come Get My Love"" or songs that stress vocal personality. Songs that have this quality are ""How Many"", ""Let Love Reign"" among others. Their are a few dull songs such as the boring cover of ""Sometimes When We Touch."" ""One Day I'll Fly Away"" is nice but the singers voice doesn't suit the song well enough more than a decent track. Sharon T.-""Tell Me"" is also a decent song. All the other songs here are pleasurable to listen and dance too!"
5,The Truth Revealed,"A quick read, this book provides information that you won't find in Loyola's recruitment pamphlets. It gives prospective students a detailed look not only at Loyola, but also Chicago and all it has to offer. Information is accurate and up to date with student opinions interwoven throughout. Prospective students are finally able to get a 'real' look at Loyola before deciding their college destination."
1,What a big mistake!,"This card didn't work at all. The installation went smooth on Windows XP, but whenever I attach any USB device to this card, it would not recognize at all. Getting this USB PCI card to work should be a straight forward and easy process to everyone, but not with this card. Please spend a few extra $$ for a better card and avoid hassling with this card."
2,Didn't work well,"I decided to try the card for the excellent price, despite some poor reviews. I figured that it would either work or not, and if it didn't I'd get a refund. I was surprised to find that some hardware devices worked fine with the card, while one new hardward device (a video converter) did not work properly (when I replaced this card with a better one, the video converter worked fine). Seems like a risky card to have in one's system."
1,lousy,"Terrible USB card. Have re-installed it twice, and it still randomly drops connections. At this point I have given up and need to buy a new one. Actually, this is one of the worst experiences I have had with an add in card. I do not recommend it to anyone."
5,"Great card, needs a slight adjustment on bracket","I bought two of these cards; one for a 2-yr old w/WIN XP and one for a 6-yr old computer w/WIN ME. At first it didn't work, but I carefully looked at how it was seated. Then I reseated it square and it worked fine. The screw mounting bracket is about 1/16 inch off, and requires gently bending the bracket with vicegrips so that the screw mount is correct when the card is correctly flush mounted in the IDE slot. Both tower computers had the mounting screw off by the same exact amount. One can bend the bracket in 5-10 sec and then it works fine.I think the people who had problems probably didn't notice this issue and screwed in the card mount and left the card cockeyed in the IDE slot, and thus it didn't work. Anyways, XP recognized and installed the card fine. WIN ME also installed the card perfectly once I installed the drivers from the included CD. USB 2.0 now works great on both computers, very fast, and very good card. A great price deal."
3,Misaligned bracket,Bracket so skewed that when tightened it pulls the fingers from the socket; could not bend backet to make it fit; had to leave bracket misaligned; used tape as dust cover; otherwise card seems to work as advertised.
1,Garbage,Don't buy this you will be sorry. Doesn't work. Spend a little more and get an Orange Micro card.
4,works as advertised,works as advertised giving added USB connection to the computer easy to intall and not failled and is still in in the computer
1,doesnt work...,"this thing never worked...go and buy similar stuff from a store so u can return easily if this doesnt work, buying online may save you 4$...wouldnt risk it for 4$..."
5,A great place to start,"I loved this book. It gives a lot of examples of what to feed your little one when they start solids. It offers a wide variety of recipes which are designed to be shared with the whole family, as well as some just for the baby, and just for the baby and one parent. I like that the author assumes your child can develop a more sophisticated palate and enjoy foods other than mac and cheese and hot dogs. The recipes are fairly uncomplicated, and the book includes sections for microwave cooking and slowcooker cooking. The author kept a diary of her daughter's eating from when she started solids until she was two, so you can see the progression from rice cereal all the way up to eating just like adults. There is some info regarding food allergies, though most of the recipes assume that isn't a problem. My daughter just turned one, and she really likes everything I have given her from this book."
4,Further Evidence of Genius,"Many years after his more famous work, the Zen master is still very, very, good. In Lila he continues to explore his new metaphysics of value, morals, and quality. Although he definitely stretches in places, there is some very solid work attempting to create a more accurate way of describing the universe and our place in it. It ties very solidly with the modern understanding of quantum physics, and fits with absolute perfection the philosophies of the seminal work ""The Structure of Scientific Revolution"" by Thomas S. Kuhn. This novel is more straight philosophy than Motorcycle Maintenance, less balanced with an interwoven plot. The plot is there though, and it gives us an even more immediate sense of the author's own precarious mental balance. Many critics call the story bleak and depressing, which may be accurate, but is about as salient as calling Moby Dick a fishing story."
5,Alternative Thinking - Read this book.,"This is one book we all must read to learn about more alternatives inthinking.Despite controversial arguments about Europeans and Victorian people,theyare absolute facts, in Phaedrus own sense.We must appreciate that.While Zen And the Art of MotorCycle Maintanenance entices you with arguments about romantism/ classical,Lila is more practical and is probably more convincing than the Zen And the Art ofMotorCycle Maintanenance.An example how an author could convincingly shatter his opponents is demonstrated amply in the initial pages of his book.(Concluding that Rigel has those same Victorian characteristics that are bad in phaedrus own sense)."
1,A tremendous dissapointment,"I loved ""Zen and"", it's one of my favorite books, but I really did not care for Lila at all. It had none of the economy, and very little of the grace of his previous book.I'm sure that both books are more-or-less autobiographical, and it's interesting to see what happens to Pirsig after the astonishing success of Zen -- but it's incredibly depressing as well.Zen is all about striving, about devotion -- and Lila is, too me, about failure. Now, failure is important...but I'd just as soon not have read it."
1,Keep your money,"I loved ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"", but I firmly believe that Pirsig should have not written Lila. It's like so many athletes coming out of retirement. Was he hurting for money?Pirsig was never a great writer. He had interesting ideas which made Zen readable and interesting, but with Lila he has many fewer original ideas and relies heavily on his junior varsity writing abilities. Reading Lila felt like I was eating warmed over left-overs of Zen.Mind you, Pirsig does have some tolerably stimulating ideas, but the intellectual content one could glean from this book could almost fill a slim pamphlet. It's like a near empty bottle of philosophy which is filled with water and shaken up. Now the patron is asked to pay dollar for a penny's worth of ideas.And what's with the prurient sexual content?"
5,"Review of ""Lila"" by Robert Pirsig","Review of ""Lila"" by Robert Pirsig.I loved this thought provoking story.It is an impressive and engrossing book.This book surpasses the intensity of ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"" in scope and in the development of the author's concepts of quality and value. It is a daring exposition on objective valuation and it offers a broad appeal. Pirsig shows his metaphysics of quality works in real situations and for life changing decisions.Open up, expand your consciousness, read and enjoy this book.I recommend this book."
2,what exactly is his philosophy?,"I ended up not caring for this book for severalreasons.1) Pirsig is not a very nice or likeableperson. Certainly it is not a requirementto be likeable, but it helps you get through 400+ pages.He knows this, but doesn't seem to mind enough tochange.2) Everyone and everything is a foil for his own ego.He never learns any thing from anyone that doesn'tgroove with what he already wants to think.3) What is his philosophy? There are numerous interestingobservations on indians and victorians, buthis philosophy reminds me of utility theory.If you are sufficiently clever you can argue for anything.In these reviews people are saying how great is histhinking, but if you had to tell someone what histhinking is, what would you say?"
5,A Life Changing book,"One of the best books I have ever read (and I've read a few!). This book will change the way you view the world.Be warned, however, for me it's tough to read another book that lives up to this one! If you find one,"
5,Oh holy crap,"I was a real novice to philosophy and Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance confused me a lot the first time I read it. But I read it again and then got Lila. Wow.Pirsig seems to have the ability to explain nearly EVERYTHING. I agree that sometimes his conclusions are a little hasty. However, Pirsig effortlessly explains away things that I had barely registered subconsciously. His view of reality seems to make a lot of sense.Anyway, I don't know enough about philosophy to say, but I think this book is grossly under-rated. This book is very, very important indeed. Even if it is not true it is well worth reading. I found the story itself amazing.As you might have guessed, I'm a fan! Awesome book."
5,An amazing intellectual achievement...I wish Pirsig would write one more,"If you can get through the first 70 or 80 pages, the rest of the book will pull you in and blow your mind. You won't be able to put it down.In my opinion, Lila is better and easier to get through than Zen And The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, but ZAMM is required reading before reading Lila."
2,A Book Adrift,"Written as a response to criticism about Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Pirsig attempts, in 400+ pages, to define the main idea of Zen, the Metaphysics of Quality. Pirsig does not achieve this definition. The book is part psychological novel and part philosophical lecture. The transitions are unnerving. Pirsig does bring up important points about how we see only the facts we want to see and disregard those facts that do not fit into our world view. Also presented are well thought out arguments about how academic disciplines limit thinking through the creation of rules that discourage inquiry outside of defined boundaries. Quote: ""Phaedrus saw with disbelief at first and then with growing anger that the whole field of anthropology was rigged and stacked in such a way that everything he had to say about Indians would be unacceptable."""
5,the long awaited start of a filosophical theory of everythin,"This book is nothing less but a giant in the written world of science and art. It continues at the point ""Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance"" has ended to develop the most comprehensive basic principle of nature ever written: ""the metaphysics of quality"". The weaknesses of the contemporary framework in which science works, are deducted in a very clear way using this theory. It offers on the one hand a solution to philsophical problems such as mind vs. matter, objectivism vs. subjectivism and on the other hand it introduces a very clear, comprehensive intellectual framework combining both metaphysics and the behaviour of elementary parts (quantum physics). These insights should have to be taught to every teenager in the world because it helps you understanding your life but remember that it is necessary to drop all prejudices whithin your mind if you want to fully understand the book."
5,A good dog...,"Much expectation approaching this book. Took me several years to read it as I was afraid to be disappointed. To read this, leave any and all expectations at the door pertaining to his previous book. Read it fresh.While the tone is somewhat melancholy, there is a sense of spirit bursting free (if only he'd let it!). But the journey, the inquiries, the cultural notes are brilliant. As for the title of the review, it's at the end and it sums up the book.Highly recommended.(This is an old review under an old email address.)"
3,"Time Tunnel on DVD, please!!!","With so many fans of the hit TV series ""The Time Tunnel"", you'd think they'd get around to offically releasing it on DVD! The crappy NTSC VHS versions are such a let down in terms of quality. I won't be buying anymore of these primitive VHS cassettes, I can't bare to watch such dismal resolution in the year 2005! Bring on the DVD's I say!!!"
5,Endearing story about the power of joy and goodwill.,"A story of a grumpy family who's youngest member finds a ""lost wandering good feeling"" which spreads throughtout the entire family."
5,Peter Maag excelled at conducting Mendelssohn,"Peter Maag was one of the most under-appreciated of the great conductors. Although he excelled at everything he conducted, he had a particular affinity for the music of Mendelssohn at which he was unsurpassed by anyone. He made several outstanding recordings of the Scottish symphony, including the one on this CD. Also outstanding is his performance of the italian symphony. If you like the music of Mendelssohn you will love it as performed by Maag."
2,Didn't know it was Jance's writing!,"I have read most of the books written by Jance and thoroughly enjoyed most.......especially the Beaumont books.This book was the most disjointed and difficult to follow book Ihave ever read. Each time I picked it up had to go back and readthe previous chapter to figure out what I was reading. Seems as ifshe did not have her thoughts in order when writing......think sheshould go back to Seattle and Beaumont as they are most interesting, exciting and even funny at times."
5,See below.,"I do not want to have to enter x-numbrer of words just to provide a rating on a book. So there.But I will expand on this one - I love the JA Jance books, all of them. But the four with Ex-Sheriff Walker, as this one is, are the best."
4,"Good read, esp for folks in southern AZ","I agree with other Kindle reviewers...many typos in latter part of the book, but once you figure out the ""code"" for the typos, it's ok. Good story line, but somewhat tricky to follow the primary plot. There are a lot of flashbacks, and a number of the characters have multiple names (one Indian and one English) so you have to follow that thread also. In addition, throughout the book, there are a number breaks in the plot to provide Indian ""stories"" of how various parts of nature and Southern AZ came to be. I found these added to the interest of the book. I don't live and have never lived in this part of the country, but I do visit southern AZ enough to appreciate the references to the local culture, environment, etc. If you're familiar with that, you'll probably get even more out of this book than I did. (Good enough that I just ordered the hard copy for my friend on Ajo Way; maybe she'll share with some of you!)"
2,"needs translation from native american to english,please!","i love to read j.a.jance books but i can't buy the one's with the native american language because i speak english. i read in english also, if i had a book of ""N.A."" translations i would be able to keep up. i've bought the books before thinking i could keep up. i believe ""jance"" should help her readers by letting them know ""before you buy make sure you speak native american"". JUST A THOUGHT!"
3,Misleading title,"The word ""Hunter"" in the title of thriller/suspense novels is usually a promise to the reader. Jance's use of the word is a spurious highlighting that should bring a fine to the writer. I notice that the titles of all her books are well chosen and designed to deliver. If they all fall flat like this one I wonder how many disgruntled readers of hers there are. Hour of the Hunter is slowed down by the numberless flashbacks and Native American legends. And all that for about 15 minutes at the end of the purported Hour. It drags, how it drags. The finale is telegraphed from the beginning and takes forever to climax. I thought at least the little boy would prove himself a hero and thus avert the Hour of the Yawn."
3,"Very poor editing, Way to many errors","Almost a joke with the typos. Someone used a spellchecker to change ""in"" to ""hi"" thoughout the last half of the book. ""that"" was another word which was changed to gibberish. Some of the other mistakes made for some funny reading. So far this is the worst book I have read with such poor editing. I could not concentrate on the story for trying to figure out what it was saying at times. I caught on pretty fast to mentally changing ""hi"" to ""in"" and ""that"" from the gibberish. Some of the others were more complicated. I read the Kindle edition and hope the softcover book was not as poorly edited. It was free but I definitely would not have paid money for this book."
2,"Good story, bad editing.","It's a good story. Well thought out plot and story line. The characters are well fleshed-out. The addition of Native American folk stories is a nice touch.That said, about 2/3rds of the way through typos and punctuation errors abound to the point of it being difficult to read the book for having to continually figure out what a word is supposed to be, because the word in there is nothing close to what should be.I was excited to get more from this author... Now, not so much. Unless it is another free one that shows J.A. Jance has figured out what editing is all about."
4,Revenge Stalks the Desert,"Diana Ladd is not Joanna Brady, but HOUR OF THE HUNTER keeps you turning the pages in this departure for J.A. Jance.Andrew Carlisle is released from prison after serving a short sentence of the beating death of a Papago Indian girl. He has one thought in mind to sneak revenge on a widowed school teacher whose testimony sent him to prison. Diana Ladd and her young son are terrorized as Andrew draws closer to their home with his vengeful intentions.The themes of the Papago Indian culture, which remind the reader of both James Doss and Tony Hillerman give you a glimpse of a different world.A must read to get the full flavor of Jance.Writing as a Small BusinessSins of the Fathers: A Brewster County NovelGuns Across the Rio: A Texas Ranger in Old Mexico"
4,3 min. review,"This book was a treasure of native american lore. As one who has lived in Arizona for most of my adult life, I welcome interesting books that contain anecdotal information about the native americans that we (anglos) have displaced. The stories from the native americans of southern Arizona that headline the chapters made this a very interesting read. The rest of the story may not have been the best mystery fiction I've read, but the fact that she included these stories about creation of the various tribes and families of animals and man, make this a memorable novel...I just wanted more of it. I think this is a better book than some of her Joanna Brady novels and the JP Beaumont series, but then I am a romantic where the Native American culture is concerned. I will read the sequel and hope the author adds to the repertoire of stories from the native americans to keep a bit of enchantment wound throughout another murder mystery where some of the characters are psycho dregs of society."
4,Suspenseful,This book is a chilling insight as to what a methodical mind a killer has. I like the way she intertwines the storytelling of Indian folklore.
2,it was free,"I love Tony Hillerman's novels and enjoyed J.A. Jance's Brady series so I grabbed this when it was offered free for the Kindle. I didn't find the plot at all credible due to the coincidences uncovered in the relationships of the characters that were necessary to sustain it. The reader is asked to accept so many improbable histories of the characters that when added up are too hard to swallow. I prefer a mystery where there's at least a chance, however minute, that the events in the story could have occurred in real life. It seemed like things were being made up on the fly to hold it together. The folk tales were enjoyable, but made the book disjointed at times. I almost think they were inserted in that fashion to keep the reader from being overwhelmed by the preposterous plot. Even the best writers will put out the occasional clunker."
4,A Real Change of Pace for Jance,"Neither a J. P. Beaumont nor a Joanna Brady story, this is a real page-turner. A widowed mother and her son are the targets of an ex-college professor who is a sadistic serial killer, who has just been released from jail after serving a sentence for the killing of a Native American girl.The sympathetic portrayal of a native american culture is reminiscent of Tony Hillerman's novels. A thoroly enjoyable story.watziznaym@gmail.com"
2,Two many names,"I usually like J.A. Jance's books, but this one had two many story lines, mix names, back and forth. Not one I would recommend."
4,unique J. A. Jance book,"Hour of the Hunter was a very unusual book--very different from any other J. A. Jance book I've read. It took me a while to get into it; all the flashbacks for virtually all of the main characters plus the Indian lore made it very hard to follow at first. I liked that you really got to know the characters, but I wished there were some other way to relate their stories. By the end I loved it--the typical mystery nail biter. In fact, I almost wished it had told more about the characters after the end. Also the second half of the book had lots of typos which was strange because there weren't that many in the first half."
4,Patio Furniture Cover,"The quality and weight of the cover is very good. The only draw back that I have found so far is that it is difficult to determine how to put the cover on the chair as there is no way to tell front from back or side. The velcro ties are very strong and hold the cover securely to the chair. I bought the same covers for our sofa and love seat and again they work very well but the issue with the direction for putting them on is even a bigger issue. All-in-all, these are great covers."
3,more and less,"What disappoints in this dvd is what's not on it. Variations and codas are missing from Don Quijote 1968 and Black Swan pas de deux 1958 with Plisetsky and Youskevitch respectively.Great loss.Romeo and Juliet bedroom scene choreography by Alberto Alonso takes up space, so too does Oedipus Rex. Boring... Jewels, are the 1968 complete black swan with Plisetsky.Definitive...Plus,...Carmen suite,GISELLE(Pas)La Peri (sumptuous)and pot pourrie variations from La Fille Mal Gardee,COPPELIA,and the complete Grand Pas De Quatre as Taglioni from 1960."
2,Basic guide unlikely to satisfy security professionals,"An elementary introduction to the topic that is likely to leave most readers hungry for more. A lot more. Discussion of explosives (appearance, use, characteristics, etc.) is basic to a point approaching banality. Identification section is based around 16 pages of full color pictures and diagrams, 12 of which are devoted to military (mostly American) ordinance. Commercial explosives cover only 2 pages and an additional 2 pages is devoted to US military color coding scheme for munitions. The thumbnail pictures will help you tell a stick of dynamite from a fragmentation bomb, but little beyond that. There are also some conspicious omissions, such as plastic explosives. Basic but useful information on bomb triggering devices and handling threats and searches is also provided."
4,Good Booklet for its Intended Purpose,"I reviewed this booklet and for the most part is a decent guide for firefighters, police, and other ""first responders."" That being said, it is not a book for professionals who perform the actual render safe procedure (RSP)and disposal procedure which would require more specific and, consequently, confidential procedures. I did find what I consider minor descrepancies in the booklet: Page 1 reads ""it has been said that even the heat of a person's hand can set off a blasting cap."" I don't know who said that, but I know of no explosives company or explosives expert who ever thinks the heat of a person's hand will set off a blasting cap. They are sensitive, but not that sensitive. Page 35, Figure 19 indicates that the last item is a M 173 nose fuze. I believe that it is in fact a M-907 or M-908 bomb nose fuze shown on figure 19 in the lower right side."
4,"Clear, concise primer on commonly-encountered explosives.","I recently read the brief (44 pages) Explosives Identification Guide and found it to be ""to the point"". This book is one of those a ""first-responder"" wishes was in the glove box when an explosives-related call is encountered. Clear photographs, and concise descriptions of both amateur and ""professional"" devices are easy to reference. The section on military explosives and simulators, and the color codes often used to identify these, is well done. The last half of the book is devoted to bomb threats, bomb searches, booby traps, ""mail/letter bombs"" and commonly-encountered triggering mechanisms. All very ""good stuff to know"" if one does not wish to make an ""ash"" out of oneself. Good information on how to go about preparing for bomb threats, and creating search teams within private businesses is also presented. This book is a good place to start if you are not well versed on explosives."
5,Loved it,Product arrived on time. It was very delicious. I will order again.I am 100% satisifed with this yummy product.
3,Snail mail,I think this product probably would have helped more if I had gotten it sooner. My injury had almost healed by the time I received the product in the mail. I ordered it on a Friday and it took 11-12 days to receive. Also it did sting quite a bit. I hope I never meet the pavement again but if I do I will try this product again now that I have it on hand.
5,Odor Patro,"I had used several other products before to eliminate cat box odors. I like this one the best of all because it is safe, effective and gentle enough that it can be used on animals in between their baths."
4,The Commander Rulez,"A blast from the past! Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen are among the best of the hippy country & western bands and they also play rock and boogy woogy. Who could forget his cover of Hot Rod Lincoln? The album cover art is truly a reminder of days gone by.Beat Me Daddy, Eight To The Bar!"
4,Favorite TV/couch Blanket,"I recently purchased this Redskin's blanket for a friend after my mother in law gave us a Seahawks one for a gift 2 years ago. My husband and I both really like the blanket -- it is soft, cudley, warm, and easy to wash. We use it almost every day. Only problem I have had with ours is that the edge-stitching has come unraveled a few times, requiring me to sew it back on. Besides this minor problem it has been a great blanket! The friend we gave the Redskins one to also really likes it."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Upgraded from a stable but 10/100 D-Link switch for improved performance. The Linksys switch worked great for 6 months but when I came in to work this morning my network was down. I could not diagnose the problem so my IT guy had to come out and after a couple of hours (at $105/hr) found that 12 or the 16 ports were bad. Amazon WILL NOT HELP after 30 days and sent me to deal with Linksys directly. Unfortunately, only now do I see the bad reviews for this product (too late for me) but hopefully not for you. STAY AWAY. I'm sure Linksys will replace the switch since it's under warranty but I'm know the new one will fail in time as well. Wish I had never upgraded and really wish I had not bought this switch."
1,garbage,8 out of 10 were dead within a yeartotal garbagereplaced them with Netgear JGS524no problems yet
1,Bad costumer support,"It broke after two months of use, I have been waiting for 5 weeks for linksys to send me a replacement, I had to buy another switch I could not leave my business with out a network for that long, not recommended for business."
1,AVOID THESE AT ALL COSTS!!!,"We have had two of these fail in the last 7 months. They both failed in well under a year. I will think long and hard before buying any Linksys or Cisco product ever again. Oh yeah, their RMA Replacement program is TERRIBLE. It took approximately 3 months to receive the replacement unit. That one failed after 5-6 months."
2,Seems to be a systemic problem,"Worked fine for a year. Last week I would have given it 5 stars. One day I woke up to network problems very similar to some of the reviews on this site . Sporadic intermittent failures of both individual ports and of the entire switch. I also had trouble isolating the problem because the errors appeared consistent with router, DHCP and firewall issues. Symptoms didn't seem like switch issues...or maybe I haven't seen enough switches. Flakey is probably an accurate term. If it were not for some of the reviewers below describing what happened with them, it would have taken me much longer to diagnose the problem. Since one reviewer said he had two of these units fail in this same way, I would think there is something systematically wrong with this switch."
2,Noisy fan,"just replaced my Cisco 2940, with this switch as I did not need the management capabilities and wanted the gigabit support. My intent is to RMA this item ASAP, not so much to do with anything but the sound level of the fan. The 2940 was not even noticable, the SR2016 must be at least 3dB or 6db louder. This is unacceptible given where the device needs to reside."
2,Another one goes down!,I purchased the Linksys SR2016 11/26/07. 12 of 16 ports are now dead. So it lasted amazingly almost exactly 13 months. We've contacted Linksys and they want the old unit back before they will send a new one! What am I supposed to do with my business for those days? The other option is to pay $75.00 for 'Quick Turnaround' of one day delivery. I think that is BS. When you buy Linksys don't be fooled into thinking its Cisco quality.The latest update is the product is on backorder at the local warehouse. I had to go purchase a $25 5 port 10/100 switch and plug it into one of the working ports of the SR2016 to give me a few more links for the meantime.
1,Not Good,"I bought this for my fairly simple home network. I immediately had problems streaming media from my Windows Home Server to my WD TV Live box. My old Linksys gigabit switch had no trouble. Out of the box this was a bust. I'm not sure if it my network could be tweaked to work, but I just bought a NetGear 16-port switch and it works fine, so why bother."
2,Thank God For Amazon Prime,"We purchased this system 7 months ago and it worked great up until this week. Starting on Monday we started experiencing intermittent problems. Our first thought was that Comcast was the issue, but our wireless network was up and going fine. We also realized that when some people were out, others were still connected. By today, only two ports were working. Luckily we have Amazon Prime and the new switch I ordered will be here tomorrow. I tried to find a 1000 16 or 24 port switch locally to no avail."
3,It has its limitations,"This switch is working fine for me tying a web, a file, and a database server in with some user workstations. I tried using it for an 8-node analysis cluster in a distributed memory parallel analysis configuration. There it failed miserably, causing an array of Input/Output errors. I am using an infiniband switch for that now ;-)Cheers!"
5,GREAT SYSTEM,"I PURCHASED THIS SYSTEM OVER THREE YEARS AGO AND I HAVE NOT REGRE IT. THE TWELVE INCH SUB BOOMS VERY WELL AND I DONT EVEN HAVE IT TURNED UP ALL THE WAY. THE SATELLITE SPEAKERS ARE CRISP, CLEAR AND LOUD. I HAVE IT ALL HOOKED UP TO AN ONKYO RECEIVER 7.1 WICH PUSHES ALL THE SPEAKERS. EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE INCLUDING T.V, STERO, PS3 AND CABLE BOX ARE CONNECTED TO THE SPEAKERS AND EVERYTHING IS PERFECT. I ALSO HAVE ALL SATELLITE SPEAKERS MOUNTED ON THE INFINITY SPEAKER MOUTS, INSTEAD OF ON MY WALL, WHICH LOOK BAD ASS. WHEN PEOPLE COME OVER THE CANT HELP BUT NOTICE. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS SET UP."
3,"Great, BUT...","These cables are a must for anybody with a component video connection, but... Watch out!These cables to not stretch out by themselves to reach longer destinations. For instance my audio hookup is less then two feet away and the R/L connectors cannot reach because they can only stretch less then a foot!Sony needs to make longer extensions. If your in my situation, try to look for another brand. If your not like me then buy this!Thanks"
4,Great way to breathe new life into your PS2,"Unofrtunately, I don't have time to write a really long review, but let me just say this: this cable is completely worth it. I have a 27-inch 1080i HDTV, and although the cable only ramps up the display to 480p, you can definately see a difference when compared to a standard television. The only PS2 game I've played so far that supports progressive scan is God of War 2, and it's absolutely beautiful. The color separation and depth is quite impressive. Just keep in mind, though, that most (if not all) PS2 games were NOT designed to be played in HD, so you'll probably see quite a few ""jaggies"" at the higher 480p resolution.Nevertheless, this cable is a great value, especially if you don't want to pay $500 for a PS3!"
5,I'm A Believer...,"I've had my Panasonic Plasma for about three years now, but have been playing my PS2 using the old composite cable that it came with. As I can't get my hands on a PS3, I decided to get these Component cables to see if they really made that big of a difference.Short answer -- absolutely. It's astonishing to think that I was playing all these years without realizing the full potential of the PS2. But now, the text is clearer, the graphics are sharper, the colors are more vivid... this is fantastic. It's like a bought a whole new system. I'm actually going through games I haven't played in years just to see how they look. Pretty cool."
4,Definate improvement over the standard composite cable.,"This component cable offers a clearer, crisper picture on my LG LCD HDTV than the composite cable. However, it does have a downside. The clearer picture exposes the edges of the polygons that make up the figures in games, which you don't see on the composite cable. It makes them appear a little rough, but overall it is a better picture."
3,Compenent AV Cable,"If you want to connect this Compenent AV cable to your ""HDTV"" please forget it, PS2 is not supporting ""HDTV"", check the PS2 Menu under Compenent connection section. I was returned mine to store ! S-cable connect is working perfectly with ""HDTV"""
1,Not all HDTVs are compatible with this one,"I own a 29"" Philips HDTV and I just can't figure out why it only works with the PIP (picture in picture) and not on the main screen? I read most of the reviews and told me to buy this thing if you have an HDTV. Probably there's a problem with our HDTV. Maybe the output signals of the PS2 don't match the TV's. Then again, if you're buying this item make sure that it's comaptible with your HDTV. Maybe you can borrow one first before buying."
1,Component av cables bring along long awaited visiual bliss,it was very effective in bringing out the vivid colors and sharp details i have been missing out on.
3,AV Component vr S/Video,"I just bought the component AV cable from a 3rd party company and already has the S/video cables (3rd party too) . I've read that AV component it's much better than S video, and tha's why I bought it. But is not!. AV component seems to be a little better than standard AV cables (RCA). S video gives an extraordinary brilliance to images. Video Component looks opaque, maybe Monster cables works better. In summary:1- S/Video2- AV component3- Standar Av cables (rca)Could it be 'cause they are 3rd party."
5,A must have-if your TV Supports it,"I got this in the mail yesterday, and it improves the quality of the playstation by far. You can even see an improvement over the S-Video cable. If your TV supports any kind of component input (there is a setting in the PS2 configuration to change the output) you need this cable."
4,Black Recon Vest,"This thing is great, the only reason I did not give it a 5 is that I haven't had the opportunity to test it's durability yet."
4,Lots of pockets.,All in all this vest meets my expectations. Many places for the items I need. The zippers work fine. Also a nice pocket in the back of the recon vest.
3,"Good vest for price, somewhat cheaply made","I wore this today on a good hike. I bought it for camera equipment, being a photographer/videographer. The Vest has a lot of pockets and is very light. This is an example of you get what you pay for. The seams on the inside of the main big pockets were not properly cut so some threads were sticking loose. The main zipper was hard to hook in and all the zippers feel like cheap plastic and rough. But I know I will use it a lot because just like any other product, I can work around its little flaws and I would recommend it to others. I have not washed it yet, so we will see how that all holds up when I do eventually wash it."
3,recon vest,This recon vest can be great for travel and bicycling .. but some of the stitching became weak soon after I began to use it.
4,"Great for work, hiking or travel","I have two of these. I do video documentaries and use them to carry lots of gear while on a shoot. What also makes it nice is that when flying, I can load up the pockets with stuff that I would normally have in a carry-on bag. Since I'm wearing it, it doesn't count as carry-on. Yes, once on the plane, off comes the vest and gets stowed away. A way to help get back some of what the airlines are taking away.I have had mine for well over a year, have done 2 trips to Rome, 1 to Paris and London, 1 to Yucatan. I've had one small pull apart in one pocket. The back pocket is simply fantastic. I can carry a netbook in it or while shooting I carry a fairly sizable wireless receiver and dual battery packs. The big pockets work well with lenses up to about 300mm or so.It is extremely lightweight and breathes with the mesh front. I will be buying more in case I tear up the ones I now have"
4,Good vest for the money,"This is a good travel vest for the money. It has plenty of pockets, and where there are no pockets, the fabric is mesh, which makes the vest well ventilated enough to use in summertime. I would prefer some color other than black, and that's the only reason I'm not giving it five stars"
2,Beautiful but...,"I got this watch as a xmas gift from my wife 2 years ago. It really catch my eye, bold, good looking, remind me a submarine.A year after, it just stop working. It was really weird, because its and automatic watch. Shake it and nothing. Left it alone and took it to repair in the local divers watch shop that i go for years for an estimate.For my surprise, the technician said the only thing he did was to reseal it and ""change the battey"".I really don't got it. THis is ""Swiss Movement"", isn't?Killer look but i got a big doubt about NAUTICA after that."
5,Great for water shots,Great filter for taking pictures over the water or ocean. Removes all 'haze' found when not using a filter.
5,"JA, EIN GUT CD","With Till you just can't go wrong, and it has till so it's perfect. This is a good song and shows the uniqueness of Tills voice compared to other singers."
1,smaller than listed,"The rear mud flaps were 2-1/2"" shorter and 1-3/4"" narrower than the listed in the description. The fit wasn't exactly custom either."
5,Dont spend your money on more expensive brands!!,"I have owned this set for 5 years now. I have never had any problems. No rust, no stains, no chips and when they get dull, a quick swipe with the sharpening steel sharpens them right back up!! I am telling you, I used to sell Henckels knives and personally I think Henckels is over-rated! Buy these knives, you wont be disappointed!!"
3,Don't expect them to be sharp,"Good solidly made knives. Good steel too. I rate them a great value. BUT just don't expect them to be very sharp when you take them out of the package. Emailed Chicago Cult. about it - as usual: no reply, no responsibility."
5,Centurian 7 piece knife set,I research everything before I buy and love to find a great value.That's what these are: big bang-for-the-buck.Cooking is a passion for me so I have no problem with hand-washing my tools. I even braved the sharpener and found that it works very well and is easier than I anticipated.
4,Good knives.,"These are attractive, solid knives that are well balanced and come with a well made storage block, but you must have a good sharpener for them to cut well. The sharpening steel that comes with the set does not work well, so I purchased the Accusharp for $10 from Amazon and it's made all the difference. If you purchase this knife set buy the sharpener for an extra $10. It's well worth the investment for knives that will last a lifetime if cared for properly."
4,A nice set!,"I received this set today and immediately 'tested' them on every piece of food in the kitchen! They are lovely! I was prepared for the absence of the bread knife after having read the other reviews, so I wasn't too disappointed.(Although that would be a real bonus to have actually included it in the set.) I also miss having instructions for the 8"" 'stone'. Very nice to have but what do you do with it? I remember the males in my family having to develop this skill and that one could ruin a knife by doing it wrong. So I'll scout around for instructions and hope they show up before the knives need sharpening. Other than that they are a pleasure and terrific at this price! I'm glad to have them."
5,Nice piano transcriptions of classical vocal favorites.,Includes the following vocal pieces arranged for piano solo:After a Dream (Faure)Ave Maria (Bach-Gounod)Ave Maria (Schubert)Cradle Song (Brahms)Dreams (Wagner)Elegy (Massenet)I Chide Thee Not (Schumann)I Love Thee (Grieg)If Thou Lov'st Me (Pergolesi)The Lass with the Delicate Hair (M.

Strauss)Who is Sylvia? (Schubert)
2,too thick for a child,the foam material was too thick for my child who already doesn't like wearing these things and freaked out when I put this one on him since he couldn't move his head around.we returned it and got the full throttle one which is thinner.
3,Item is great .. but sizing leaves a lot to be desired!,"This item is so small that I will need to return it! The sizing isn't explicit enough. You may need to go to a store, size it and then order it...but then why would you do that!"
4,Boating best a good product,"The users are two boys--a two-year old and a four-year old. They wore the vests without complaint, which is good.I'm going to get the next size Stearns vests as the grand kids grow. I'm also going to get adult vests because the design seems to be so functional and they are coast-guard approved."
3,Do run small,"I read the reviews and still ordered the items because they were a great price. But I will warn you...they do run small. This one I am reviewing here is for my 3yr old. It is for 30-50lbs I believe. He is currently 38lbs and I don't see how a 50lb child would fit in it. So just a warning, these are probably more 20-40lbs."
4,Great vest - just for Kids under 4,Excellent product works very well. 3 straps across the front and one between the legs. It is just sized for a child who's very small probably 3 or under.
1,Needs better balancing to be safe enough,"These lifejackets have some things you'd wish for such as a connecting belt between the legs, a choice of bright identifying colors, easy-to-use buckles and good floatation. There are 4 buckles including the bottom one. I believe this vest is built around the plan to float a 40 pound child. My two children tried them but they require more effort to float head-up than some other less expensive devices.The outside material is strong, indicating these vests should last a long time. They're not heavy and thus easy to carry. With some design improvements they could be good."
3,Warning: NOT fanless!,"I was looking for a fanless graphics card for my HTPC. I saw this one, and on all the photos I could find (including those on eVGA's own website), they were all depicted as fanless. However, when I received this in the mail, there was a fan. All website photos of video cards are typically ""reference photos"".So beware. I think in general, the 128-bit DDR (either 128MB or 256MB RAM) cards are likely to have fans; many 64-bit DDR graphics cards are fanless. Just shop around. For reference, I ended up getting a Chaintech SH5200-128-DVI."
1,"Trash, not worth buying","Kinda disappointed that something so good would be torn down so poorly. Besides being poorly written (the book is an endless bibliography!), the content is bare minimum. Author should have tried to gather more concrete evident, or abandoned the project."
1,GIMME A BREAK!,"Here we go again! Now someone's going to tell me that ""Mr. Ed"" was a vehicle for Jim Jones, or something like that...Why do people write trash like this?"
2,Too many leaps of logic to accept most of the conclusions,"In general, the book tries to draw connections between ""what is evil"" and what Disney is promoting. Many of the Disney movies referenced in this book are based on classic stories of good and evil but this is not to say that Disney promotes evil. The author points out that some of the material produced by Disney subsidiaries is not family fare. While accurate, Disney isn't promoting these products under the Disney name. Also, many other the references were either taken out of context or were very vague. In general, I had a hard time accepting most of the conclusions of the book, especially those about Walt Disney himself."
5,One of the best investigative books out there,"Ferraiuolo takes Disney to task and rightly so. In his book he continually presents an accusatory argument agaginst Disney, then PROVES it with heavy footnoting and quotes from Disney empoloyees and film and family experts. The book starts slow, but ends with a punch so hard that, if you read it, will change your view of Disney altogether. it is that well done. What a read! Masterful"
4,Spidey and Goblin,"This series is great. The figures look great and their size is perfect for my 3 year old son. We have a lot of fun battling and chasing with the other characters he's collected from this line so far, and I plan to purchase others for him soon. He recently told me he wants to have lots of these guys."
3,"Inspiring, but.....","The book is informative and inspiring, as well as a very simple presentation. However, it boasts that the exercises can be done at home, yet in at least half of the pictures, an exercise bench is being used. If you don't have one, it is rather difficult to improvise. I returned the book!"
5,Works great with ubuntu,ubuntu detects and installs this modem with no hassle. Actiontec is a great external modem that will increase your dial-up speed on both ubuntu and windoze.
1,DOA,"My modem arrived in non-working condition. I haven't tried to get a replacement because the amount of money involved is low, and not worth the hassle of contacting the vendor, returning the defective unit, etc.The literature that comes with the modem indicates that it was built for distribution to new customers by AOL. One wonders: Are these returns from AOL customers?"
1,Wrong Color,The color I received was not representative of the color depicted on the website. Too dark. Very dissatisfied. Did not use.
3,Walter Russell is wonderful and,"This book is in my view, most magnificent in the first few chapters.It seems to me that in any profound work of universal scope,the first words are the most important...such as in the Tao-Te Ching...""The Tao that can be named is not the eternal Tao""...Lao-Tzu.After the first exquisite pronouncements in this book, it gets verycomplicated and as it goes along...more so, more so.It is not that the statements by the wonderful Mr. Russell can not be understood, he is very clear throughout his elaborations.However, it's like walking a fractal path into into into complexity etc etc...yet,the first chapters offered the deepest insight...in my view...this book, as it goes along...becomes overloaded.He certainly has something to offer if you like having your mind filled up.I rather empty my mind and see beyond the words."
5,Pivotal episode!,"This was a great episode... while the navies are yet to confront one another, all of our favorite characters got some air time today. The royal court, the Right Kyung-sang and Left Cholla high commanders, Japan, and of course the scummy merchants all got to participate in some great plot advancements. Tense too!"
5,GREAT FOR EVERYONE!!!,"This is the most intelligent and exciting action series. The lessons it teaches far outweighs any creative additions by the writers. The history is accurate for the most part and an amazing story. IYSS and his naval record are studied at the US NAVAL academy in Annapolis. He was a true hero to the Korean people, their George Washington as it were. Most young Americans would be well served to watch this show. The politics of fighting a war, the tenacity required to win, all remind us of the birth of our nation. You will not be disappointed!! A MUST SEE!!!"
5,"Get this plus the 6"" Calphalon Meat Fork....","and you will have a very nice carving set priced at about $29! Both are made in China but have exceptional quality for the low price. Do remember to hand-wash and do not place in a drawer with your other inexpensive knives. Like any quality, high-carbon steel knife, you should run this over the honing steel before each use."
2,Could Be Better,"I have this CD as well as ""Top 25 Exitos de Alabanza""Note that the songs are 'covers' by a group of singers. Also, the lyrics themselves may differ from what you are used to as they have been translated differently from the original English. A few songs have been translated literally, rather than lyrically, so it comes off sounding grammatically and musically off. Also, Maranatha needs to proof read the printed lyrics. Sloppy editing with many orthography errors (spelling, accents ...)."
4,A Brave Young Man Does Shares A Very Personal Story,"Roger Baker shares with all readers his personal account of his year in Korea. His letters home were extraordinary in their level of feelings and honesty and yet allowing his parents to be part of this very difficult time in his life. I found the book warm, funny, sad and yet very tender. Tankers are a special group of men for sure, and living in these machines in the heat of summer and cold of winter must have been unbearable. Roger lets us experience his trip to adulthood in a very personal way. He is a true American Hero."
2,Not an easy listen,"I have found that there are two types of R & H works. There are the lively and upbeat scores, like Cinderella and Sound of Music. Then there are the slower and denser scores, like Carousel and the King and I, which are not bad, but not to my liking. There are not many songs on here that appeal to the popular tastes. Music theorists will probably love it. I have found that the best R and H works are the ones that sound like they were written today, most notably Sound of Music."
2,A major disappointment,"This recording is so tinny-sounding that I cannot bear to listen to it.Despite wonderful performances, the sound seems to come from a deep well.Don't waste your money on it!!!"
1,OMG,"Simply put: ONE GIANT YAWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I work for a theatre company so this is right up my alley, however this CD is just below average!"
5,Great Product,This product works well for color treated hair. I use it once a week and it leaves my hair soft without weighing it down. I have fine straight hair and swim in chlorine pools regularly so this is a great product to revive my hair. I would recommend this for anyone looking for softner hair.
5,Undisputed Queen of C&W,"I'm a big fan of Patsy Cline's music but in all honesty her vocal sound was more in line with pop music than Country. It doesn't however take away from any of her greatness. But Kitty Wells was pure uncut Country all the way-The female Ernest Tubb if you will. Two of my all time faves are on this cd- The classic ""Will your lawyer talk to God"" and ""Password""-- oh yeah ""It wasn't God who..."" is also a favorite. These are the original tracks and therefore make this cd worth buying. We love ya Kitty !"
5,Harvey Walden Boot Camp VIDEO,I received my product in a timely manner and it was new. Of course I was skeptical about ordering. Because I never used Amazon.com before. My cousin referred me sense I was too afraid to try Ebay. EBAY seems to complicated. thanks for my video at good price I might add.
5,Harvey never disappoints...,"I bought this DVD several years ago && incorporated it into my regular gym routine. Mon/Wed/Fri - gym, Tues/Thurs - Harvey. I absolutely loved it && still do! Coming from a military home && background, I'm used to && quite enjoy his tear u down to build u back up style. When I first began using this DVD (originally && again after I broke my ankle due to an unrelated accident), I was pleased to see, not only a beginner version (Tracy), but also an advanced version (Michelle). While I've never been able to do push ups on my fingertips like Michelle, it's still nice to see that it's an option. I prefer the 30min version, because I do work out for several hrs on Mon/Wed/Fri, but the extended version is definitely not a disappointment. When I originally began using this DVD, I was about 50lbs overweight, but w/ Harveys help, && pushing myself @ the gym, I lost that weight && more in about 6months. Do yourself a favor, if u can handle tough love, buy the DVD!"
5,Great workout!,"As A fan of Harvey and Celebrity Fit Club, I just had to check out this DVD. Boy am I glad I did. I found Harvey to be motivating in his special way and I really worked up A sweat. I appreciated the fact that not only could you choose between A short or long workout, but also got to choose the music. Options for the music being Rock/Alternative or Dance music. The Rock adds even more energy for me to get through to the end. I recommend this to any fan of Harvey's bootcamp workouts."
5,Men's Mysteries... and more,"One of the few (dare I say ""only""?) books out there for Wiccan Men's Mysteries, this book is a ""must read"" for my students, both male and female. One of the things that I love about it, is that it is more than Men's Mysteries... It explores the changes that were created in our psyches when we changed from a hunter-gatherer society to an agrarian one.The changes in men's roles because of that societal shift were profound. And that shift affected our religion as well. I think it goes a long way to explaining two of the major trends in Wicca, those that find their spiritual roots with the hunter-gatherers and those that find their spiritual roots with the agrarian cultures.If you can find it, read it."
5,Meteorites: A Journey Through Space and Time,"I once thought that meteorites were hunks of rock from outer space. Not any more! This fascinating book opened a whole new world for me. The easy-to-understand text and accompanying artwork and photographs gave me a new understanding of these messengers from beyond time and space. Who knew they held secrets to the birth of our solar system and to how planets formed? A terrific, well-done book. Meteorites rock!"
1,Disappointed!!!,"Bought this item for my new Canon 24-70 2.8 L, apparently I didn't thoroughly checked the product when it arrived, I immediately propped it in and after a week of use I started seeing some whitish spots on the filter, I have always been careful with my lens and couldn't recall bumping nor dropping the lens. I am a casual hobbyist. Disappointed, please check your items the moment it arrives SHOULD you decide to get it."
5,A Must Have Item,This is a must have product for all of your camera lenses. I purchase my UV filters to protect my lens. It will take high impact. That is exactly why I recently purchased this filter. My camera had fallen at a wedding I was shooting and it cracked the filter. It did its job and my $1000 lens is fine. I decided to purchase the Hoya brand because I respect their products.
3,WOULD LOVE TO READ THIS BUT,"CRAZY PRICING ALL AROUND...BOTH THE KINDLE AND PHYSICAL COPIES ARE REALLY SKY HIGH IN COST.and I didn't know Kindle ""rented"" books either...still, dont want to pay $10 to rent it...will check my library I guess."
2,Hoya 67mm UV filter,Cheap but not useful. Buy one for my Nikkor 18-70mm as a scratch protection. It gave serious ghost and flare effects to the pictures. Don't want to re turn it because it cheap so the shipping may cost half of the price. Buy another 67mm Tiffen UV filter to replace it.
2,Cheating picture,"Picture show "" UV(O) MADE IN JAPAN "" ,but I got is "" UV Made in Philippines "" ,so disappointment!"
1,HOYA 67mm UV Filter,Filter is loose in frame and probably will not affect function. But it is disappointing.
4,Really good- Loretta Lynn may be country's queen!,"Of the big 4 of late-'50s-and-after women of country (Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, Dolly Parton), I think Loretta is my favorite, partially because she's the most country, but also, at her peak, she probably made the most really good recordings. All the ones I know of hers are on this collection, and many are classic. My favorite is ""Fist City,"" but things like ""Blue Kentucky Girl,"" ""One's on the Way,"" ""You Ain't Woman Enough,"" and ""Coal Miner's Daugher"" and others are really good. A bunch songs I like less, including ""After the Fire is Gone,"" ""Out of My Head and Back in My Bed,"" ""Honky Tonk Girl,"" ""When the Tingle Becomes a Chill,"" and more. These are songs I like less or don't care for much, but that's more because they don't make much of an impression of likeability on me. I don't think they're bad by any means. So by overall giving an impression of being really good, it gets 4 stars."
1,Save your money,"I bought this book based on the positive reviews I read. As a real HP fan who has read not only the books, but has ocassionally read several JK Rowling interviews, and postings on her website, I found this book tremendously disappointing -- full of typos (like St. Mungro's instead of St. Mungo's, Ravensclaw instead of Ravenclaw), covering only the most superficial of trivia, and, most importantly, missing anything that might have made me think of new connections between the books and insight into possible theories. Save your money, and just talk about the books with your friends."
5,Fantastic Insights,"As an avid Potter fan, I am always trying to get the latest information on HP. This Book 6 Trivia Book delivers the best insights I have read into HBP and all the prior 5 books. It is so up-to-date, and it contains great new facts about the upcoming Movie 4 that I never knew existed.Daniel Lawrence is by far the best source of HP info I have found. I know Lawrence is supposedly good friends with JKR and he is recognized as the source of most of the new HP info found on the top web sites. This book is his best work yet.I think you'll enjoy this companion book no matter what your level of HP epxertise is. This is a fun book that will challenge any wizard. If you need to know everything about Harry, this is a great addition to your Potter collection."
1,What a Waste,"Unless you like misspellings and really want to know the name of J.K. Rowling's midwife, what occupation her first husband had, and what her favorite childhood book was, don't buy this. Total waste of money and an insult to HP fans with its' lack of depth."
2,awful trivia book,"This book was jam-packed with both spelling and content errors; i am amazed that a man who considers himself a ""Harry Potter authority"" managed to misspell 'Ravenclaw' three times. Leading readers to believe that JK Rowling lives in Kensington (she lives in Edinburgh)and that zodiac ends in 'k', it makes me wonder a) if Lawrence pulled all his information off of casual fan sites who had no sources to back up their information, and b) whether anybody bothered to read this book before it was published.There was some okay trivia, but none of it was incredibly challenging, and some of it was completely and utterly useless: i didn't buy the book to find out exactly how many copies of Order of the Phoenix were sold on the release date, or to find out information about some place that was used as a backdrop for one of the films. My advice: if you are an obsessive Harry Potter fan, like me, and are looking for a good trivia/companion book, DON'T choose this one."
4,Great anime OVA!,"This underrated anime is really good! The characters, story, and airplane battles are awesome. The only problem with this is that Act 2 & 3 haven't come out on DVD, :( so you gotta buy them for VHS to finish the story.A game based on the anime called U.N. Squadron in the U.S., came out years ago on Arcade and Super Nintendo. It's a great horizontal shooter game like Gradius and you earn money by destroying enemy ships to buy newer planes. You also play as the pilots from the anime like Shin, Mickey, and Greg!"
4,Wonderful price,Great price ....was a little hard to put it together ...they only thing came in the box was a picture showing you what goes on top ...after I followed it ..there was a few mistakes ...they Need to have better instructions ..at least number the parts ..explaining ..but the cage was a good price ...came speedy and another problem it doesn't snap together so I still have to buy a few parts to make sure the cage is safe and keep My birds in their new home ..but great price .
2,no instructions...,"I like the design of the cage a lot, but I'm really not liking the lack of instructions. What is so difficult about slipping a sheet of instructions in the box?"
3,Williepat,Purchased as a second cage for our screened-in porch. Would not use as an only cage. Great transaction.
3,Too Noisy,"My dog loves this ball but it drives me absolutely insane. Every time he picks it up or chews on it the ball squeeks incredibly loud. If I'm on the phone the person on the other line asks me to take the ball away, it's that loud. If you buy the ball make sure you keep it outside!"
1,NOT AS PICTURED,"Not honest in advertizing .This is a 4""x1"" toy. It is shown zoomed in at least 10x. in description/photo. When searching for 'LARGE DOG TOY' this came up. $17+ for a teeny 4""x1"" toy is OUTRAGEOUS! Swallow hazard for large dog. RETURNED!!! Buyer beware. Will never order from this vender again."
5,Messianic CD,Good music. Enjoyed the quality of this CD and the artists are great. I recommend this CD to anyone seeking Messianic music
4,"Excellent, scholarly bio of a nearly-forgotten star","I first noticed Florence lawrence when I bought a copy of Daniel Blum's ""Pictorial History of the Silent Screen"". So many of the pictures in that book were of Florence that my curiosity was piqued. Who was this woman? Thank goodness Kelly Brown wrote such an entertaining and scholarly biography. I wish there were more bios out there on early and perhaps forgotten stars. Bravo, Kelly Brown! And thank you for all your hard work!"
4,"solid, nice graphics","received the game this week and then played it for 2 days. The graphics are nice, clean and detailed, the units are realistic, the explosions look very real, the sound and music are also very good. The whole game is about urban warfare and it is fun. The units can garrison buildings and each side has special forces which can clean those occupied buildings and set mines.Even the game mechanics are quite good but there are some issues with the AI.There is also only 20 missions and after changing the file when i got all units it was really easy to beat the game.I give it 4 stars."
1,Displeased,"i had purchased this item april 23, 2010. the same day i had ordered a necklace to go with it. i sent it to michigan, the date of expected arrival would be between april 27-may 5. by may 7 i contacted my friend who was suppose to recieve the packages. she informed me that she had gotten the necklace but nothing else. i contacted the seller to see where my package was. i recieved an e-mail saying they were going to fix my problem and get my package to its destination. by may 13 the horse pendant still had yet to be delivered. i contacted the postal service instead. i have gotten several phone calls from them and they all told me they were going to find my package. The post office was more helpful the the seller! the package has yet to be delivered. its been almost a month since i ordered the pendant. Word to the wise and to who ever buys this item, be cautious and i pray my problem wont occurr with you."
5,It works well,"Hoya has some good polarizers for the 52mm and this is one of them. Its not MRC which can be a problem. Had several scratches on this lens but, really can't see in on my photos, only the dust particles appears on photos. Comes in handy when taking pictures during the day and capturing reflections on lakes, and some beaches (if the water is clean) helps you to see reefs and what not. I notice it doesn't come in handy when shooting through a glass window where you're capturing a picture of a person or thing through the window as it cuts down on your reflection (depending on the light source too).I bought this a couple times and my first one, the ring broke off and was bummed out. I never had this happen to my b+w."
4,Great harmony always exhibited in works by the Sons!,"Recognized as a national treasure by the Smithsonian, the Sons of the Pioneers were founded by Roy Rogers, Bob Nolan, and Tim Spencer, three young men who only wanted to be on the radio. They managed to develop a unique harmonic style, copied coutless times by other performers. In so doing they and their successors have had a profound effect on country and western music and American music in general. It is a shame that their greatness goes largely unnoticed today. The Sons of the Pioneers still exists as a performing group; they operate out of Branson, Missouri.Steve Richie"
5,Beautiful....,"Briefly, bought several of these sterling bracelets to make charm bracelets for my family with foreign coins we had saved from trips. The bracelets are heavy enough to support the coins. Love mine and my family members have comments how great these special memory bracelets are to them."
1,supriseeee !!!!,I haven't had this bracelet for less then a month and I haven't even worn it its been in the lil bag ot came in and I went to put it on yesterday and it was gold ! Lol when I first got it it was silver and over the month it changed lol very odd . Other then that's its a very nice style but its for sure fake and not sterling silver as the seller stated . Its nice for a night out as just to accessorize :-/ not what I wanted it for .
4,A Good Book That You Should Read,"I'm Sorry Almira Ann is a wonderful book about a young girl named Sarah . Sarah and her family are traveling on the Oregon Trail from Missouri on a covered wagon with a group of other covered wagons . Sarah's best freind,Almira Ann , is also traveling with the group and with her family . But if only Sarah's , hasty spirit would just leave the trip would be alot easier for everyone. But Sarah can't quite keep the hasty spirit from causing her to disobey the rules . Along the way Sarah accidentally causes Almira Ann to fall from her wagon , and when she does she breaks her leg . Sarah knows she needs to control her hasty spirit . If you enjoy historical fiction you should enjoy this book."
4,Take and Toss Bowls,"Decent product for the price. I do notice the lids seem to lose their shape after they go through the diswasher a few times-they still work, it just takes a little extra effort to secure them to the bowl. Overall I'm pleased with the product."
4,So far so good :),"I have been using these bowls for a few days and so far, they are perfect for baby's little portions. What I like most is that they stack very well on top of each other, both bowls and lids together, saving space. I recently re ordered some more."
4,Great for snacks and lunch boxes,"These bowls are terrific for hauling around baby/toddler/kid snacks in purses or diaper bags. I use them often in packing my preschooler's lunch. They are a good size, the lids stay well secured, and are easily enough removed by my 4 yo. I only wish there was an option on here to choose which color set to buy. I was hoping for the pastel pink, purple, and yellow set, and instead received the blue, orange, and green containers."
3,Make Mistake in Buying due to error on my part,"I have no one to blame but me - I thought there were more then just 3 pads in a package - now I know why the price was low - the good old saying ""if it is too good to be be true then it usually is!"" Good Product but can buy equivalent retail at Lowes for 2.76 for 12 instead of 1.64 for 3"
4,I enjoy pretty much every song for a pretty low price.,"This tall country singer, who folowed in Mark Chesnutt's footsteps, being good friends with him, is a singer who I'd have to say by listening to him, that all of his songs, including, ""The Keeper Of The Stars, a beautiful ballad that make you cry a river of tears of joy, and was played at many weddings, have at least some humor in them. He is a funny guy, a character singer, who writes creative and original comical songs like "" Lifestyles of the not so Rich and Famous "", ""Walkin to Jereusalem"" and ""Watermelon Crawl "" and party songs about having fun, like, "" I'm From the Country "". There's the more serious songs, like "" Love Lessons "" that he also sings with dry humor, but really plays like a true ballad. The man has a distinct and to me, a neat voice voice that isn't too deep. He isn't a real serious country singer, there is no song that I know of that is flat out serious. Even his serious ballads, have subtle humor."
1,Out of print .. wasn't worth it,Like most of the black lace series this also is a book for people who are intpo very specific kink .... Defenitely the author has to be a woman since the book IS WRITTEN from a womans point of view ...In this case .. if you like reading about and aggressive female that would be called a bohemian throwback and seems to enjoy the mystery of being diddled (for lack of a word that won't upset the censors) then ... guess what ... THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU ...My kinkiness isn't that specific so I read it once and put it on the shelf ...
4,Rich and sensual India,"I love this book, full of beautiful colour plates illustrating interiors and designs of India. This book gives a lovely overview of Indian Interior design covering architecture, furniture, colours, textiles, rugs and decorations.There are different sections covering forts and palaces, tribal, modern, merchant houses and revival interior design so one gets a fantastic overview from the traditional to the present day. The photography is wonderful and the colours are rich and sensual, a feast for the eyes.J Thomas"
4,My 20-month-old loves it!,"The book has very nice photo-type pictures, large type and many many sturdy flaps that close nicely when the page is turned. The flaps are easy to open after the first use, good for younger toddlers. Pages are slightly coated to resist liquid damage. The book is rather large, difficult for my son to hold it in his carseat, but would be all right for a 3 or 4-year old.... The focus of this book is on Bob, Wendy, Pilchard and the machines."
5,Wonderful entertainment for various ages!,"When I arrived to visit my 2- and 4-year old nieces this past weekend, this was the first book they brought me to read to them; in fact, we read it MANY times during the course of my short visit. Whereas my younger niece enjoyed just lifting the flaps and looking at the pictures, my older niece could actually name many items behind the flaps, such as ""it's 8:30!"" on the first page. But cutest of all, they both were able to reply in unison to Bob's question ""Can we fix it?"" (answer: ""Yes we can!""). The book includes quite a few flaps on each page, and they hold up well to repeated openings of little hands. Given that this book is so colorful and fun, I think it would appeal to a wide range of children, even those who have had little exposure to Bob the Builder."
5,Me 163: Rocket Interceptor volume 2,I bought this as a gift for my husband. He chose the book and thinks it's great.
5,DID SHE DO IT?.....OR DIDN'T SHE?,"It's not difficult to know who really killed the subject early on, but to quote a sentence in the book, ""It also said the courts were a crapshoot."" This true crime story is a good one. An individual who critiqued this story stated there was too much detail. I thought the detail was necessary as the story progressed; it was essential! Beverly Monroe, a PhD, an accused and convicted murderer, has a story of great interest. On the State's side you have the motivation to find the guilty person and the details of dastardly deeds, and on the Defense side, you have the myriad of motions and just plain work to try to prove innocence. What a spider's web this story becomes. A fine read worth 5 stars."
3,Did she or didn't she?,"Did southern lady, mild-mannered and genteel Beverly Monroe, murder her lover, wealthy art collector and scientist Roger De la Burde? John Taylor's account leaves the question open. In fact, you are given a website when you can register your own verdict on the matter.Long-time journalist Taylor has given us a workmanship write-up of this intriguing case. Beverly is characterized in depth, as is De la Burde, and his pregnant Polish mistress, and even Beverly's two daughters and son. One idea he expresses will leap out at you: How much has feminism really accomplished, how deep has been the impact of women's liberation, when two highly educated and accomplished women still become obsessed over a man?"
4,Engrossing Tale of Intrigue and the Law,"I was looking for nonfiction written like a novel, and found it in this book. The tightly woven story and the bizarre cast of characters kept my attention drawn throughout. As a criminal defense attorney myself, I found the author's grasp of the law and proceedings excellent. Although I am a fan of mystery novels and generally like my books to have nice, neat endings, I thought the unresolved ambiguities made this book far more interesting. I've been recommending it to just about everyone I know!"
4,"As a story, not a warning","This book is thick with plot turns and meaning. It is not for the light reader; you must pay attention to every detail or you will miss a turn. I have seen other reviews on this book, and they all claim it is like a warning, (like my wife thinks, who insisted I read it) that is fine. I'd like to say this book is a fantastic story, all on it's own."
2,Should have saved my money!,"I wasn't that impressed with Holmes first release! I think that with the proper songs, Monty would be able to sustain himself in the music business. One word of advise from somebody that knows you, ""Look for your first #1 Close to home dude""!"
2,Disappointed in Quality,"I've purchased Hoya filters in the past and was very satisfied. I didn't realize until the filter arrived that it was multicoated and had serious reflection problems. Also, the filter had the Hoya name but was made by Tokina. I am familiar with Tokina lenses but didn't realize they had glas making capbilities. Did they buy Hoya filters? I strongly recommend anyone buying a Hoya polarizing filter buy only one that has the HMC (Hoya Multicoated)labeling. Multicoated polaring filters are a must as one of their primary purposes is to reduce reflections."
2,Below My Expectations,"Had a cheaper Tiffen polarizer from a previous 35mm camera that does a much better job that this supposedly upgraded filter. Only a slight difference when used, and not worth the money. One major complaint is the filterdoes not have a serrated rim which makes it extremely difficult to grab on tight enough to remove it from the camera lens."
1,Fell apart,"This filter fell apart on me after two uses (and I used it VERY delicately). Attempting to remove it, a piece of metal popped off the inner ring/threading. It cannot be repaired and the two pieces no longer thread together. I just read many similar reviews for a different sized Hoya cir-pol filter. Apparently, this is a widespread issue. I would not recommend that you purchase this filter. This does not even deserve one star, but I have to give it a rating..."
4,Good polarizer - some vignetting,"In general a nice inexpensive polarizer. Got some very nice pictures on a sunny day in the Swiss Alps.However, the ring is quite thick. This led to some vignetting when I had my Nikon VR18-200 in the 18-35mm range in some shots.Note that unlike the HMC UV filter I have from Hoya, which is made in Japan, this less expensive filter is made in the Philippines. Definitely not the same quality."
5,Polarizer a Must,Polarizer works well with my Canon 40D camera. I keep it on at all times when I am taking pictures outdoors. The colors are much more vibrant. It also takes the glare off windows when taking pictures from inside. Just turn the polarizer and watch the glare disappear.
4,Great all-around circular polarizer,This circular polarizer is reasonably priced and works well for such a large mm size. Even though it is not multi-coated it produces a very noticable difference in non-polarized vs. polarized views when dealing with clouds and bright skys.
5,A very useful filter.,This is a replacement for the same make & model filter that got broken. I bought the last one in a camera shop and the price was considerably more. I appreciate the saving this time. It is a filter I use for most oydoor work.
3,Surprised by the vignetting,"I suppose the overall quality is good and the results for the most part were fine but If the colors at the top edges are already dark (deep blue sky, for instance), the vignetting is fairly pronounced. I can crop or fix in Photoshop but I don't want to have to allow for a crop when I'm framing a shot."
2,Poor driver support wrecks comfy headset,"The headset is probably the most comfortable headset I've ever worn. The detachable mic is a nice feature, although I feel that it doesn't lock into place firmly enough. However, the headset is almost entirely useless to me because it requires special drivers and Turtle Beach isn't currently supporting 64-bit operating systems. This isn't clearly mentioned either in the product listing, and you have to explicitly look it up on the company website to find this out. A quick google reveals that this has been a known issue for several years, and with the proliferation of 64-bit operating systems of late that is a very poor showing. For a $150 headset, I'd expect better support from the company."
4,Great Buy!!,"Ever since I bought this product my marriage has gotten better!For real though, I can play my games, watch my movies, etc as loud as I want till the late hours of the night and not disturb my family; plus I don't have to sacrifice sound quality!!!Everything is great with these headsets except one thing. Already the pins on the cable from the headset to the sound card thing have bent. They are VERY fragile and if they go you have to purchase a whole new headset. Take EXTREME caution when plugging the headset in. As long as you are vigilantly careful this should not be a problem. Having kids that like to touch/break everything makes it even more of a challenge.Bottom line, I love this headset. Worth every cent."
3,These Mud Flaps are not customized,"Regardless of the claim, these flaps are not customized for the Nissan Frontier. Installation is possible, but they do not fit properly. They look retarded. I will discard them and order the OEM set. A waste of money."
4,Good for the money,I had a little challenge mounting these on my 2012 Nissan frontier . I think it's good for the money but hard to install.
4,"Good Product, but bewareof issue","his is a good product, but it is not made for trucks with factory fender flares as my RAM Laramie has."
4,great mud splash protection,"I installed these on our 2005 Honda Pilot last year and they have proven to be effective. In our rainy season, they are quite important and useful."
4,A Well Balanced Introduction for the Westerner,With the use of primarily Israeli sources this documentary introduces the westerner of today to the actual realities on the ground. Mr. Alatar has been assisting tri-faith groups make visits to the Holy Land for years to ensure that the plight of this troubled land is better understood in an atmosphere of mis-information represented in the western press. This DVD can still be obtained at [...]
5,Amazing Price,"It clears my nose up in a few minutes no matter how stuffed up it is without any stinging or discomfort. The active ingredient is .05% Oxymetazoline hydro chloride which is exactly the same as regular Afrin but for a fraction of the price. On Amazon it's $15 for a 3 pack of .05 ounce bottles and in the stores a .05 ounce bottle usually runs for $7.00 with this you get 4 1.0 ounce bottles of exactly the same thing for $16. The only con I can see for some people is the bottles are not pumps like normal Afrin they are regular nasal spray bottles which is very uncomfortable to use. This doesn't matter to me because I just refill old Afrin bottles, for the price its a steal and refilling bottles is worth it to save $$$$"
4,Cheapest Oxymetazoline on the market,"This one is great,the amount equal to 8 Afrin bottle.But you have to pour it to the nasal spray in order to make it work, Minus 1 star for not making a no-drip bottle."
4,good nasal spray,This is a pretty good nasal spray mist that works. It is not as good as the one Costco use to carry but it works. Good price & it was sent right out. Quick shipping.
1,Nasal spray,Kirkland had a great product in the NASAL DECONGESTANT 12 HOUR NO DRIP PUMP and then they changed to this which is nothing but a regular nasal spray.Big mistake. It is $5.47 at Costco and not worth 2 cents.
2,little cheese flavor,"This is basically a cream sauce; there is some garlic taste, but very little cheesy flavor. It's a good base for adding your own flavors to, though it's kind of expensive to use it for that."
5,Best Alfredo I've Had!,This alfredo is so good! I always add a little sprinkle of granulated garlic and onion and some pepper and its PERFECT! Mmmm
2,Not very good,My wife totally hated the sauce. It's garlic and cheese flavor is over powering and was not a hit on our pasta dinner. She will not allow me to ever purchase this item again.
4,"great book, a little simple","This is a great book of modern illustration. It does have a wide variety of styles and methods. My only complaint is that it seems to have more ""simple"" style art than I care for. It leaves it a little thin and insubstantial in that sense, but overall the majority more than makes up for this problem. Definately modern style, so if you aren't into that I don't recommend this."
1,Do not buy this DVD,"I bought this DVD thinking that it was the Release Technique by Larry Crane. Instead it is an interview with Larry Crane regarding his Release Technique. The DVD does not provide any information regarding the actual technique, but instead is just an infomercial convincing you to buy the actual course. To top it off, it seems that it was ripped from a VHS tape and converted to DVD."
1,This material is BAD news...,"This material leaves you hanging and if you want to really get any benefit from it, you need to buy his expensive additional courses... which leads to your needing to buy more and more and more courses...It's a lead-in to more and more and more of your money in his pocket... and even after all of that... you'll find you could've gotten a MUCH greater benefit from going directly to the teachings he CLAIMS his courses are based on... to the DIRECT teachings of Lester Levenson himself.Bypass this material (in it's entirety). Save your money. Be smart."
5,Lots of Great Memories,"I had never been a big Gene Watson fan, but he was a favorite of my husband who passed away in 2004. I bought the CD because of a couple of his favorite songs, but found that I loved everything on the CD myself."
4,Great,"This is one of the most interesting books in the series. The series is fantasy, and I recommend it to grades 2-4. This is great for kids and it gives you facts about what or where they are near. This is probably one of the best series books I have ever read."
2,childs book.,The quality was bad. It looked as if the book had been in a basement soaking up moisture. Definitely not the quality you would get at a department store. Paid the same price with shipping as I would pay at Target but the quality was pretty bad.
1,Ugh,Lots of scary parts. ! O2 w w w w w we w m look'll k Bill Bill go xml fillChip yum hmm fill chi Wyoming xml hmm xml c.f. com dunno flip so yum will go to
5,My Opinion,"I give this book an A+.This book enspired me to be a beter person.It tought me a good leson. It taught me that you are supposed to care about your little sister, even when people bug you. This is one of the best books I`ve ever read.This should have every kind of medal there is.I love this book.I wish it was my very own.This story is perfect. Now I want to read every MAGIC TREEHOUSE book."
5,Transitioned my son from picture books to chapter books,"I bought these books for my almost 6 year old. He could not put the series down. He snuck a flash light into his bed and read what seemed like all night (based on the puffiness of his eyes the next morning). If you want to prod your son into reading more, this series is the way to go."
5,A Review of the Knight at Dawn by N.O.,Have you ever gone on a adventure? Well in the book The Knight at Dawn is about a boy and a girl Jack and Annie and they go on adventures. Jack and Annie look for a magic tree house and when they find the magic tree house they clime a latter that is connected to the tree house. Then they look for a book that is opened and they wish to go there. Then the tree house starts to spin... I n this book Jack and Annie go to a castle and get thorn in the dungeon. If you want to hear the rest you should read it your self.My favorite part was when Jack and Annie escaped out of the dungeon and into a river. It is my favorite part because when Jack lands in the water he freaks out. I think that is funny.I would recommend this book for second grad to 5th grade and you will always remember when you read it. NOW GO GET THE BOOK.
3,The book was okay.,"I liked it ok. I liked the vocabulary a lot. The story was sort of interesting. My favorite part was when they found an exit to a trap.I didn't like it because there was not much detail.I would recommend this for kindergarten to third grade.Signed,Andrew age 8 and in second grade."
5,as advertised,This is my second version of this same book-best of its type as far as I'm concerned. Glad to have it.
5,Excellent tutorial text,"I have used this text for a university self-study course. The students have found it very useful. Because so many graphics are made available from the publisher's web site, very impressive web pages can be created from the beginning."
3,It's required for the course.,Like many required textbooks it is overpriced and there are better books available. It's still cheaper here than most other outlets and it does provide one more reference to turn to.
1,"crappy watch band lock, nice watch","i had this watch returned to amazon.com because of a weak lock clasp or perhaps a faulty lock clasp on watch band. the design for the lock clasp is poor. it has no tension to securely lock it. when i moved my wrist around or moved my hand up or down, it would unlock and slip off my wrist. putting on or removing clothing with long sleeves would cause it to unlock and slip off because of the cuffs touching the lock. i even removed an extra link on the band to secure it and bring it closer to my wrist to make it tighter, but the problem persists. the watch itself is beautiful though. nice and heavy. big face. to bad for the lock design. maybe it was the watch that was sent to me that only had that design problem or flaw. i did not opt to replace it. i will get a different watch design with a better lock design."
5,"Another hilarious book, can these boys ever dissappoint?","This book is as expected a true gem, with non stop laughs all the way is impossible to put down. The fab four meet in this book and immediately hit it off, or nor in Rimmers case as you follow them through an adventure which goes wrong, nothing unusual there .What is unusual is the way Grant Naylor manages to keep his audience all the way in this wonderful book.Enjoy."
4,"Shoot, shot, and beat 'em up","Pretty good for kids 12 and up, the adults will like it as well. The good part was there was a plot and a reason for the story line, which it seemed to follow pretty well. Got real interesting in a few spots. Enjoy!"
3,IM COLOMBIAN IT WAS OK..,"of course I had to see & review it plus I like Zoe Saldana who is NOT Colombian, btw. (she's half Dominican half Puertorican) So my review,..love to say it was fantastic but it wasnt..it was ok. not an academy nor a razzie! A lot of the scenes were unrealistic JUST LIKE mission impossible (everybody loves that movie tho) It kinda kept you at your seat so..check it out."
4,Shes a killer,I wasn't expecting much from this movie. It surprised me. It is better than the normal super 100 lb chick kicking 200lb mens butt movies. It had a decent story line and some nice stunt work.
2,Rented For a $1.99 And Still Felt Ripped Off,"This movie was a big disappointment. Zoe Saldana is great to look at but anyone with a brain is going to get bored of that real quickly unless there's some substance to back it up. This movie had none - very little character development, weak fight scene choreography, no story continuity. I couldn't wait for the movie to finish."
1,Colombiana,"A handful of French filmmaker Luc Besson's most famous films betray his penchant for femmes fatale, titles like La Femme Nikita, The Fifth Element, The Messenger, and, to an extent, Leon: The Professional. With Colombiana, which Besson wrote and produced, he returns to the genre with the help of director Olivier Megaton, and the result is uneven. Zoe Saldana plays a Colombian woman whose family was murdered by mobsters when she was young. Now, as a grown woman and a ruthless assassin, she sets out on a path for revenge. If the plot sounds familiar, it's probably because the premise is sort of a staple of the revenge thriller, and though Saldana gives the performance her all, there just isn't enough to set Colombiana apart. The movie not only fails to make an impression, but also suffers from erratic and sloppy filmmaking; it'll probably leave you unsatisfied, but if you've liked any of Besson's and Megaton's recent work, you may still find something to enjoy here."
4,Great movie,"I was surprised to see this movie didn't do as good on reviews, but if you are into action movies then it is a must own. Lots of great action scenes and not a bad story."
3,ok not bad,ok movies for people likes too much actionbut not excellent as I thought. As far asDVD its self good quality no problem what soever.
5,columbiana,real bad *** revenge girl movie. she handles herself with so much finesse and killing was easy. flawless execution and timing. loveeeee it
3,Movie Reviews,"Entertaining, but not realistic enough to ever watch again. Lacks quality acting even though the story line had potential. Next?"
4,Death Wish Saldana,"Remember La Femme Nikita? Or, better yet, Lucy Liu's history in Kill Bill? Same thing. It's nice revenge fantasy, and Zoe Saldana is certainly gorgeous to look at, but there is nothing very new here. Which isn't a bad thing! A few interesting, somewhat creative assassinations, even though I've seen better. The blood and gore is a little lacking, not to mention the absence of nudity, limits the impact a bit. Nonetheless, I enjoyed its simplicity.For a mindless action flick that does a good job from beginning to end a viewer could do much worse."
1,Weak action flick,"The story has been done before, if not for a beautiful lead actress nobody would have bothered seeing this flick. Plot is very forced, acting is acceptable at best and writing is pretty bad. Stick to renting this, don't waste your money buying it."
2,Too fake,The movie is too fake. Most of the plot is so far fetched that it's completely unbelievable. At least some action movies try to be believable. This one doesn't. At the end of the movie I felt I wasted the time watching it! But the action scenes are nicely done.
3,Okay,"Great action movie and the acting was good. Zoe Saldana performed magnificently, the movie thrilled like any other action movie and she got you on her side getting back at the people who murdered her family when she was a child. Not a movie I thought I would watch over and over..."
1,"Holy crap or unholy crap, just crap","Zoe Saldana, let's face it, she is hot, she can act, but she can't carry this movie. This movie just drones on and on. If you have seen the TV show Nikita twice, you have seen this whole movie twice.I have watched this movie for 1 and a half hours and had to stop. It just sucked.Not to give anything away, but she kills someone. Wow. They try to throw in a boyfriend to create some kind of sympathy for her emotional sacrifice, just doesn't work. Why would I care, she a psychopathic killer. Everything builds her up to this. Someone should have told the writers to let it go, and just let her be a darn good looking badass.It just didn't work, by the end I didn't care who she killed or didn't kill. Buy the poster, nevermind,poster is to expensive, but there are some scenes in here that you can freeze frame that are awesome.Did I mention that Zoe Saldana is hot?"
1,Ultraviolet won't download to iTunes,"This was the most disappointing product I received this holiday season. I was hoping to download this to my iPAD to watch in the car while traveling. Sorry Folks, can't do that - even after registering on 3 different sites - a scam in and of itself since you cannot opt out and continue the registration process to redeem the code. This is nowhere near as user friendly as just loading the disc and having it copy to iTunes after redeeming the code. I will no longer purchase any DVD's or BluRay discs that have this as the ""digital copy"". And the movie studios wonder why their sales are declining. Seriously, it will take you less time to RIP a movie from disc."
4,columbina,we had to see the same night that the movie came ....we love Zoe in the movie ...she was great
4,Pretty Good,"I was recently in the mood to watch a good action thriller, and this movie came to my attention on Netflix, so I added it to my cue and gave it a watch after it showed up. I expected it would be fairly good, but it was actually better than I expected. Maybe not as good as some...I did feel it could have used a slight bit more action, but all in all it was very good, and the action that was in it was pretty good. If you're into action thrillers, I recommend giving this one a go."
2,meh- seen it before and better,"Very predictable which made the movie extremely boring. With the exception of the opening chase scene and the main fight at the end, its a wooden script with even more dead-eyed acting."
5,Excellent,I am a fan of this type of genre and so enjoyed the female role. A very good movie i recomend it highly
2,Save your 2 hours...,"When I saw the preview of this movie, I already knew what I was getting into.It wasn't just an action movie but it has box office gold ""Zoe Saldana"" in it. The problem is the story and production of this movie leave a great deal to be desired.The story is highly predictable and as a result cliche and frustrating. I found myself checking my watch on more than one occasion as the film dragged on.This movie misses the boat and I am being generous with 2 stars.Watch something else."
4,Great Action,The reason why her father was killed could have been explained much better giving you some more buy in. Also some people complain about lack of character development which is fine but if you go in expecting an action flick you'll be very happy. This movie was actually better than I anticipated. The pacing was good and very little over the top scenes. I'd like to see a spin off with this character. Zoe was fun to watch.
4,awesome,oh my goodness this movie was great. i like a lot of action in movie especially if a female is playing the roll. i can watch this over and over again
4,Great Action Movie,"I thought the whole movie was great!I love the chase scene in the beginning.....perfectly shot, perfect escape.....lots of action.I never thought to myself at any point during the movie....that's ridiculous.Plot: 4 out of 5: The plot is a little thin but, it's an action movie. A genre not always know for great plots.Cast: 4 out of 5: Some of the characters were a bit cartoon-ish but not so much that it detracted from the movie.FX/Action: 5 out of 5: It never stops. Lots of fun to watch.This movie is definitely worth renting & watching!!!!!"
5,Excellent,Plenty of action with a story. Hope that maybe a follow-up movie is made. I also liked the filming locations.
3,EHHHHH,I have watched it twice (so it's good enough to watch a second time) but isn't the greatest movie ever made. Zoe Saldana is great and shows her ability and sexiness in this movie!
5,Awesome Movie,"this was a great movie, the story was great, the actors were great and the action was awesome. this is one of the best revenge movies i've seen in a long time. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do"
3,Over-the-top Revenge Epoch,"Living a happy, normal life, a ten year-old girl named Cataleya (played as an adult by Zoe Saldana) narrowly escapes execution at the hands of the same men who'd already murdered her parents. After escaping, she goes on an epic (at least for a ten year-old traveling alone) journey. Finally ending at her uncle's home in America. Her uncle asks the young girl what she wishes to be when she grows up and she says an assassin. After initially trying to dissuade her from this course of action, he offers instruction.There's nothing earth-shattering here. There's barely a narrative here. It's basically the human equivalent of two trains colliding on a track at full-speed. I admit, I enjoyed it. Having said that, it's a popcorn movie, or it would be if I still ate popcorn. Action sequences, fight sequences, and explosions. If that's not your thing, skip this one. If it is, you'll probably like it a lot."
1,Imbecilic from beginning to end,"I don't even know where to begin, but I do know where it totally ended... for me. The scene in Chicago where the protagonist's uncle, at the corner of her elementary school, decides to prove a point by unloading indiscriminately at the next car driving by with a hand-cannon, watches it careen into a tree and other cars, gets on one knee and explains why she needs a proper education, gets up, takes her by the hand and strolls away... with onlookers present. WTH? Here's what would really happen in this part of Chicago: a few of the onlookers would be like, ""What the? What in the m*therf***in hayle... it was that m*therf***er o'va there... that messican m*therf***er o'va there... crazy a$$ m*thaf***er just done shoot.. hayle no mmmhhh..."" and then they'd start shooting at him with their own guns and then the police would come.Stupid, stupid movie."
5,Brown fox,"Great action movie! Zoe saldana,was born to play the role .... loved the plot and story line.Lennie james is an underrated actor, hope to see more from him in the near future. Two thumbs up !!!!!!!!!!"
1,Action fan,I love action movies and I really did not enjoy this one. I mean come one...it is ridiculous. What a corny lame film. Some skinny girl is a ninja from hell who becomes a hitman (oh I mean women) to slowly get revenge for her father death. I can't believe I wasted my life watching this dog.
1,Don't waste your money.,"Not much to say about this film. The scenes are over the top, and quite unbelievable...yes...I realize it is a movie, but jeez! This is nothing but junk.Don't waste your money."
2,"Decent acting, bad writing","I love Zoe S but the writing was so bad that she didn't really shine. The dialogue between her and the police officer was painful. Even with a better dialogue, I don't think that would've helped the movie enough. The storyline was weak. Her family was killed and she spends the rest of her child/teen years becoming an assassin/killer so she can kill the people that murdered her family. I have seen way better revenge films (Taken, Mechanic, Shooter, Unforgiven, Count of Monte Cristo, etc.). Two stars because this movie is not a complete yawn. There are some entertaining moments."
1,pure crap..,"I shouldn't even waste a couple of minutes of my time reviewing this movie. It was nothing more than an extended photo op for Zoe Saldana. While she's beautiful and worth the look, the movie is worth-less. I'm an action movie fan but this one really was disappointing. Don't waste your money renting it."
1,Boring Don't waste your money is not worth it,Boring Don't waste your money is not worth itstupid from beginning to end don't waste your money buying this movie
3,"I love this film, but the packaging is a problem","I was curious about the charges of bad packaging, so when I was looking for this DVD at a store, I gently shook several copies of them to detect if the disks came loose, and the first three I checked did have loose discs. I bought one that didn't have loosed discs rolling around and getting scratched up, but ordering this from Amazon doesn't afford buyers that chance.on a 1-5 scale:5 for the film1 for the packaging"
5,I Am Cuba,"Rescued from the dustbin of history by Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese and released in 1995, Russian director Kalatozov's sweeping, stylized ""I Am Cuba"" is communist agit-prop, to be sure--but also exhilarating, world-class art. Swooping over sugar fields, through dense forests and urban milieu of both the decadent and militant variety, Kalatozov portrays the beauty of Cuba and its people via a quartet of loose, dreamy, near-wordless stories--all set to the beat of pulsing Afro-Cuban music."
3,3 Stars For The Camerawork,"I AM CUBA is a remarkable technical achievement. The camera swoops and dives and flies in ways unheard of before the advent of the steadicam. If you're looking for a visually stunning couple of hours, by all means see this film.Unfortunately, if you're looking for anything beyond stunning visuals, you can pretty much forget about it. I AM CUBA is also a non-stop parade of often laughably simple-minded propaganda cliches. Dr. Goebbels would have loved it."
1,Beautifully Shot--the rest is garbage,"This is propaganda at its worst. The camera work is unbelievable. It's a shame, I think the cinematography in this film is the greatest I've ever seen. But the glorification of the ""Revolution"" is too much to handle. Batista was no saint, but Cuba faired much better under him than Castro. You gotta hand it to the Soviets, they knew how to make beautiful films all the while promoting their disgusting agenda. Don't eat before watching this film--the film's message will make you puke."
1,I am Cuba,"... From an artistic point of view the movie is one-dimentional, flat and uninspiringly boring, not to mention so badly shot as to leave one wondering who the was the camera director ... ? The movie criticizes prostitution in pre-Castro Cuba but there is now more prostitution there now than ever before. They criticize United Fruit but the fact was that American Sugar Company built houses, schools and clinics for their workers, while the Cuban-owned mills did not and by 1959 60% of the sugar output was in the hands of Cubans. The film made a point of showing the guerrillas learning to read but what good is knowing how to read if the government does not allow oppossing views or other political parties to take part in a democratic process? It is not a good film in any sense of the word."
5,Revolutionary filmmaking at it's best,"The first two scenes alone are worth the price of admission! The camera work as it floats on the river, past huts and under foot bridges and then immediately to the rock and roll on the roof! Incredible filmmaking. Some scenes may be naive or melodramatic but the totality of it is so beautiful and inspiring. It is one of the best films I have seen in the past ten years.The total Milestone package is great and puts the story and the film in context. Why hadn't this masterpiece been seen sooner? is answered in 'the Siberian Mammoth' documentary. Liked the interview with Yevtushenko as it adds some political background.Thanks to Coppola and Scorsese for their artistic generousity in promoting this film."
1,The Ultimate Edition contains SCRATCHED discs.,"I received The Ultimate Edition as a Christmas gift from my wife from Amazon. Considering Amazon always packs their products quite well, the I AM CUBA box came in perfect shape. Inside, however, two of the three discs had come loose in their slim cases and are scratched. I took the advice of the Milestone representative who responded to the complaints about scratched discs on this very amazon page and emailed Milestone video to inquire about a replacement. They have still not returned my email. As great as this film is, please know that you will not be paying for perfect discs when you purchase this item."
3,beautiful but ultimately disappointing,"The style and production of the video are beautiful and it is a classic. I was enjoying it very much until towards the end, the inevitable happened and the good hearted peasant took up a gun and left his family to go and join in the fighting... and from then on it was just a propaganda war film"
4,astonishingly beautiful,"Unfortunately, the film is too long and its political content irritatingly simplistic (as one might expect, given that it was produced under the Soviet regime). In spite of these flaws, ""I Am Cuba"" is one of the most beautiful movies I have EVER seen, and most of it is delightful."
1,Image's DVD transfer of a great film is for the dogs...,"Understand this: I am fanatical about this movie. But Image's DVD transfer is so painfully inept to watch -- horrid print, spots and speckles, strobing due to oddball frame rate, hideous contrast levels -- that I couldn't bear to watch the DVD beyond 10 minutes.The person responsible for such an incompetent and abysmal edition of this can't miss movie should be flayed alive in front of all true lovers of cinema. Image, which chopped 10 minutes out of JULIET OF THE SPIRITS despite the representations of the packaging, is the Good Times Video of DVD. That they would do such a worthless job for a Fellini film is cause for anger. That they would due this again to Kalazotov is sacrilegous."
5,A TOUR-DE-FORCE IN FILM MAKING!,"The movie is truly awe inspiring as it brings not just great camerawork but also a true study of the hardships inflicted upon not only the people of Cuba, but of many Latin American nations of the present day."
4,Great for Rosacea,"My dermatologist recommended this cream for controlling the redness from my rosacea. I bought directly and got a good price and excellent service from the company. And of course, the product does its job."
3,A funny book.,This novelization is quite hilarious! I had some good laughs reading this book. Mr. Miyagi is so funny both in this book and in the movie. The novelization is fair. I recommend seeing all The Karate Kid and The Next Karate Kid movies.
5,Greetings from Dodger Stadium,"This is great stuff, even if it sounds a little like Helen Dell on the Wurlitzer organ at Dodger Stadium in the 1970s. Or Weird Al playing the Starlight Lounge under a pseudonym for an extra buck. But why on earth does it cost forty smackers?"
1,Work Great Until...,"Worked fine the first few times, then for no reason at all it started to get hot. I unplugged it each time it started to overheat (usually after 20 minutes). Then one day I charged my laptop with the recommended setting of 50 watts, and after 10 minutes it (literally) exploded and caught fire. I'm no electrician but I don't think it's supposed to do that. I never used it for anything but charging small, low wattage electronic devices. I recommend getting a more expensive, better built transformer... one that won't, you know, explode after ten minutes."
4,THE club anthem for 2000,"From the opening floor-pumping sounds of bass, 'til the alarming sounds of THE siren (a must in any club anthem - see 666 Amokk and Alarma), lock'n'loads 'blow ya mind' really does just that.A tune which will play on and on in your mind, hours after you leave the club..."
3,COOL ALIEN MOVIE,"This flick is all good !! I you love B movies, you can't go wrong with this one. It seems to me that most of the other reviewers should stick to blockbusters and leave my friend XTRO alone.I agree this movie is litle bit slow at times but other than that, the director and the actors ( ANDREW DIVOFF rules !!) do their job properly. On top of that, the special effects are indeed great and the plot is maybe not that original but very touching.Call me naive but a story about a tortured ALIEN, whose wife and unborn child have been killed, who takes revenge upon the human kind in such a wicked way really does it for me.GORYSSIMO says check this out !!"
1,"Disgusting, hostile, vile, and stupid... yet chilling","I agree with another reviewer in that ""despise"" is the right word for this film. ""Disgusting, hostile, vile, and stupid"" are some of the right adjectives.The only ""redeeming"" feature, sort of, was the ""alien vivisection"" scene. The acting and effects were lousy in that scene, yet I found it truly horrible, yet moving, and terribly saddening.And you really understand why the alien does what he does.It makes me wonder if someone involved in making the film had family members who had something horrible done to them by one of the ghastly dictatorships, or terror or crime organizations, of which there are too many in this world. The scene reminded me of so much I've read about such things.Yes, very bad film, but with a kernel of something all too horribly real at the center of it."
3,"ehhh, it's what I expected","This is a typical low budget sci-fi flick filled with overly campy goodness. So if you're a fan of these types of films, of course its a good watch. The best thing about it was the actual Alien, very creepy looking."
1,"Best Watched Drunk Or Even Better, Not At All","Here's a film that is best watched drunk as with your senses dulled maybe you won't fully notice the bad acting, cheap effects and a story that's so dumb you'll feel like giving all involved a swift kick."
1,appauling,"well just what can you say about a movie like this the effects,screenplay,directing,acting were simply awful none of it was even slightly realistic.To think i actually thought this film was going to be even slightly scary. Oh yes and by the way i didnt want to put any stars but seen as though its compulsory to put at the least 1 i had no option in large i am basing this revieuw on the vhs version,although in contrast any one buying the digital disc version must be out of their mind."
5,A Very Sweet Book,"I found this book at a book fair at my sons daycare and got it for myself as a Mothers Day gift. The words are very heart warming, and the pictures are wonderfully done. This book also came with a card which I found so moving that I have framed it. I would highly recommend it to any mother(or father) to read for their children, or just to keep for themselves as a little 'pick me up' when parenting gets tough."
2,"expecting hard childrens' pages, not soft","I expecting hard childrens' pages, not soft pages. Too much work to send it back. Oh well. k m k"
5,adorable,I used this book in my pre school class. We performed it for our mothers. Each child was easily able to remember what a page said and they took turns saying their part. The mothers loved it and then the children presented a signed copy for their moms to keep. I use this every year.
4,A very good academic tool for learning about the saxophone,"This book is truly good as a reference. It is written in a scholarly manner, and it is not oriented towards performance, but rather it covers issues such as the instrument's history, its evolution and the classical repertoire. It also has several very detailed chapters covering the relationship between the saxophone and jazz.It has certainly made me more saxophone-literate, but it has yet to improve my playing!"
1,Limited Point of View,"This is heavy academic reading, in the style of a dissertation. It has some value as a reference but with many holes, as it is written from the professor's perspective and misses the point of view of the professional player/artist."
3,French rap in Quebec,"Okay I haven't bought the CD yet so I gave the band the average 3 stars. I saw them on French TV yesterday... it's a sweet discovery, their lyrics are politically oriented. Being French, I don't know much about Quebec culture so I can't wait to receive their album...Just don't trust the one review saying it's ""a weird CD""!!Que les francophones et francophiles leur donnent une chance!"
3,a weird cd,"uhhhhh my dad got this for me in quebec. the first 3 tracks are cool but i know only a super little bit of french.Nice beats, i cnat say much about the lyrics though."
2,Sony Pictures rip-off,"I purchased this DVD set new from a third-party seller to discover the feature ""Guarding Tess"" only plays as fullscreen even though the outside of the DVD case clearly indicates 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen for each of the two features. The feature ""It Could Happen To You"" played as widescreen. To be sure this was not a 'hiccup' in packaging I purchased a second DVD set new from another third-party seller with the exact same result. Sony Pictures has blatantly misrepresented the feature ""Guarding Tess"" as widescreen and you only get the fullscreen version.If you are looking for the widescreen version of ""Guarding Tess"" then DO NOT BUY this DVD set because all you will get is a fullscreen version."
5,Two great movies for one price!,"I like this two movie set. Guarding Tess and it could happen to you, just wonderful I love these two movies never get tired of seeing them. Thanks to the sender, it arrived in good condition and in a timely manner. Thanks Amazon!"
4,Get it when the price is right!,"Just picked one up from a local store, it was on ""Managers Special"" for $14.99 / reg price $45-50. No idea why it was so cheap, so I got one for my notebook. Installation was a breeze in XP Professional, ignored instructions by putting card in first then only updating drivers from cdrom. I do not like 3rd party wireless utilities, XP has it built-in. Connected right away, configured mac filter, no broadcast sid, wep encryption on my Linksys 54g Router......sweet. I was shopping for cards for the past 3 days looking at...netgear, linksys and belkin planning to spend $35+. Truthfully I would never buy motorola for retail...$15 you got a deal."
3,Flaky,"I bought this card as it was on sale and I got it for $9.99 I was expecting Windows XP Pro to recognize the card as soon as inserted it but it didn't. I had to use the installation CDROM that came with it. Installation was a breeze.One of the first things I came to know when using the card was its limited range. I have a Linksys WRT54G wireless router and it is placed high enough from the ground with minimal obstruction. Compared to the Cisco AIR-CB21AG-A-K9 (which I already have) the range of this card is very less.Other issue I had was the software to control the card. If you decide to use the motorola's wireless utility to configure the wireless connection, the connection is flaky and the connection is dropped frequently. However, if you use Windows to confgiure the wireless connection then connection does not drop that frequently.Overall I give it a 3 stars."
5,Works with Airport on your Mac,"THis particular card will work on any G3 or G4 Apple powerbook with a pcmcia card slot, all the back to the wallstreet maybe even the 1400. Just plug it in and OS X. will recognize it as an airport device. Very easy to configure!!"
4,works as advertised!,"The product works great! Installation was a breeze, although the photo is a little outdated.There is a 3.5 mm female jack on the side of the PIE box, not RCA cables, but it comes with a male 3.5 mm --> female RCA adapter. I bought a separate 3 ft male RCA --> 3.5 mm male cable to connect to my iPod, but could have had a simpler/cleaner install with only a 3.5 mm male --> 3.5 mm male cable.Sound is AMAZING, though!"
5,Works great with my 99 Cabrio,"Although this little box almost costs as much as a cheap stereo, it does the job admirably. In my 99 Cabrio I added a mini jack to a button blank on the center console and was able to velcro the box to the inside of the console, to the right of the ashtray, then fish the connector up into the radio slot. I attached the grounding cable to the the big screw on the back chassis of the radio. It gives me clear audio without any noise from the car's electronics."
3,3 Stars equal 3 Reasons why you need this book!,"There are three reasons why you need to read the ""Ratzinger Report"":1. If you want to know the state of the Catholic Church from it's top ""German Shepherd"" whose voaction consisted of keeping the Catholicity of the faith: read this book!2. If you don't want to know the state of the Catholic Church, well, that's your problem: read this book!3. If you haven't heard before,the whole problem of the Catholic Church,is that we are all part of it,and if we are all part of the whole problem,that means we are also part of the whole solutiontherefore: read this book!"
5,The position of the church today. Great book,"This book is an interview of Cardinal Ratzinger by journalist Vittorio Messori. Questions vary from ecumenism to liberation theology, Ordination of women to the issue of vocations to religious life. It is a great insight of the Catholic Church in modern days. Cardinal Ratzinger also gives some personal information about his being raised in nazi Germany."
3,Stewie,"This product is very durable, but it is kinda small. I thought it would be much bigger, but it serves its purpose which is what i wanted."
3,Too generic,"The song is a worthwhile listen... but way too repetitive and boring to want to go back to.In my opinion the original song ""Liquid Sun"" is the best song ever by Astral Projection. Warning: NOT A SONG TO DANCE TO.This remix has little if nothing to do with the original, which is not a bad thing, but still... just not a good enough track to be called ""great"". While Liquid Sun had memorable melodic lines, the C&S remix is just a straight-up ""big base"" dance tune. Almost the opposite of what Liquid Sun was ever meant to be :)"
4,surprisingly powerful!,"I do alot of tough drilling. The Bosch holds up quite well. I hope it is as durable as it is powerful; I haven't had it for too many years. You cannot beat the price on this little guy. I do wish it had the level like the dewalts do, but otherwise--a great tool at a great price."
1,don't,"One of the worst products made by bosch. Get a milwaukee, porter-cable, de walt, or anything else, but not this."
2,SUN has set on this one,"THE ""BEST"" OF SUN RECORDS has NO Elvis on it? Elvis, Scotty and Bill helped make that label legendary, and vice-versa, and not even ONE of their 'B' sides is here. Yah. yah, I know.. RCA...etc. Speaking of B's....There's only THREE TOP 40 hits on this album. Come on, guys-- get serious. SUN record's ""best of"" could easily fill a box set, yet all that's offered here is what are, to the average listener, obscurities.The ""brightest"" SUN is nowhere in sight."
2,I guess you get what you pay for,"I am a beginner to DSLR photography. I recently bought an expensive (for me) 18 - 200mm lens for my Nikon D40 and wanted to protect that purchase with a UV filter. I chose this one based on price. Unfortunately, this filter has led to distorted photos for me. It's OK outside in normal sunlight; however with pictures that I take inside (particularly when using the flash), areas such as people's hair get a weird looking sheen (for lack of a better word) to them. It also seems to cause a less than sharp focus. I finally took the filter off after a couple of serieses of disappointing photos, and now my pics look as sharp as ever again."
4,using it as lens protector,"Uing it to protect my lens,, which is common practice with a lot of people as far as I know..it also helps to reduce the need to clean the lens as well, dust, etcI think its a good investment, and it doesn't effect the picture quality at allFred"
2,don't be fooled,.... don't be fooled by the picture on the cover of this dvd which would lead you to believe it is the RANDOLPH SCOTT version of the movie... the movie that is actually included is the older silent film version from 1920..... it looks like they have changed the picture to reflect the correct movie now (8-24-07)
2,Very weak - but it is dustless,"Very weak - but it is dustless. In fact, mine sits in my basement and creates no dust. I found this unit worthless for drywall finishing in a new installation or a large remodel (also Amazon didnt have the coarser grit papers I needed). I think this unit may be useful for very small repairs where dust is not acceptable however, I found a manual sander for $19.95 with a ""dustless"" system that uses a bucket of water to trap the dust before it enters a regular shop vac. I find this $20 system (without the bucket of water)works much better than the ""turbo sander"". I do connect the manual dustless sander to the loveless vacuume and unless you get very aggressive with sanding on a wall, it collects all of the dust produced.. The loveless vacuume is great - it is quiet, powerful, and doesnt loose suction even after hours of sanding and cleanup."
2,Disappointing,"Yeah, like everyone else I wanted a cheaper version of the Porter unit. This meets the letter of that request. If this unit is used slowly on surfaces requiring relatively little material removal, results are tolerable. If, however, you use this to smooth an area that you had to ""sculpt"" in (transitioning from plaster to drywall or special contours, for instance) you will be disappointed...or worse. Unit bogs down with relatively little pressure, so go slow and let the machine work at its' own pace. Unit does not get into the last 1/2"" or so on inside corners...so be prepared to finish those by hand. If you don't buy their REALLY expensive vac, try a good shopvac with the available drywall dust bags...eliminated filter clogging problems and airborne dust."
1,Disapointed,"I was disapointed with the product. After 15 minutes of use, the orbital head slowed down. It stopped within 20 minutes and I was unable to clear the head to continue the job."
1,don't buy it,"my Sears wet/dry vacuum works.this little anemic machine can barely suck up a paper clip and IT DOES NOT suck up sheetrock dust.No power, gimmick all the way"
1,Im not happy about it. But I like the model but its all plastic,"Its all plastic , plastic never lasts!!!! Probly one or two months it will last then break .I may have to buy 5 like each year!"
2,save your $,"I wish I could discribe the disapointment I felt in the overall perfomance of this equipment, it does suck up a lot of the dust, but time can't be a factor in job completion"
5,American Juniors,"This is the best CD I have ever purchased in my entire life.1. ABC- Chauncey sounds SPECTACULAR! He, Lucy, and Danielle have the leads.2. No Matta What- nice song, kinda slow. Chauncey and Lucy lead.3. True Colors- all members have a solo, sounds very good.4. Unstoppable- Taylor, Lucy, and Tori lead. Taylor has a long, high note in the 3rd verse that's breathtaking.5. One Step Closer- Chauncey has most of the song, but all members have a solo.6. Have You Ever- Lucy sings lead7. Reach Out (I'll Be There)- Chauncey and Tori sing lead with little parts by Lucy and Danielle.8. Emotional- Lucy and Danielle sing lead.9. Sundown- Tori, Taylor, Danielle, and Lucy sing lead. Chauncey has some background parts.10. Bring The House Down- Girls sing lead again.11. Love Ain't Gonna Wait For You- Lucy and Taylor sing lead."
1,??? Do we know the truth ???,"American Juniors are very good. But these songs are just remakes!!!! Half of those songs are S Club 7 and S Club 8's. If you enjoy listening to them, then I advise you buy the REAL version. Most of the songs can be found on either S Club/S Club 7, or S Club 8 cds. They have MUCH better voices than AJ, I can tell you that!"
2,Copycats!,"American Juniors are just wannabe's of S Club 8! They take their songs, and sing them horribly! They also took some S Club 7 songs. American Juniors can't even BEGIN to compare themselves to S Club 7. These kids have some potential, but they really need to get their own music. Check out S Club 8/S Club Juniors and S Club 7 for the original songs, which are actually performed well."
4,Infectious Pop,"This is one of those CD's you put on and right away it is an instant classic. Combining elements of cheap trick, 999 and the real kids-this is the best sing along CD I have bought in a long long time. The first song No Force is reason enough to fork over any amount of money to buy this CD"
2,Skip It - Too Cutsy,"Yes, I know this book is supposed to introduce non-physics people to the fun of physics, but this isn't the book you should get. It tries too hard to be cute, and often it gets in the way of the teachings.The book you should get instead is the Cartoon Guide to Physics (also sold by Amazon, by the way). It's well illustrated (naturally), well written, and very informative."
1,Don't bother buying this book,"I can't figure out who the audience is for this book - I think it's too difficult for most non-physicists to follow and understand and too ""cute"" and oversimplified for physicists to appreciate."
2,Unreadable juvenalia.,"I was expecting something wonderful having loved Under the Volcano, but I found this small volume unfinishable. The narrator bursts into Greek at intervals, presumably to remind himself of his wonderful elite education even as he scrubs latrines on a tramp steamer."
4,satisfied,i am satisfied with this product. the sound is clear and strong. a good product for those that love good sound but don't want to pay a lot for it.
4,fine for the money,"nice, compact, affordable. plays cassettes and CDs, which is rare these days. only complaint is that it gets very hot if left on, lacks the ability to replay a song on a CD (or reverse through something), and the volume controls are in an awkward place. otherwise, we've only had it for a month, but so good so far!"
4,Great DVD,"Good skate video with great music. If you like this, I recommend ""Yeah Right!"" by Girl Skateboarding, and ""Fully Flared"" by Lakai Limited."
4,"""Downriver"" definition totally wrong","Not having read this yet, I can only assume that it wasn't Mr. Estleman himself who gave the definition of ""downriver"" as being ""anyplace not in Detroit itself.""A lifelong resident of a downriver community, I feel the need to clarify. The term ""Downriver"" refers to the cities that are, for the most part, literally ""down the Detroit River, south from Detroit."" In other words, it includes the cities south of Detroit that actually are bounded by the Detroit River on the east (River Rouge, Ecorse, Wyandotte, Riverview, Trenton, Gibraltar) and a few cities extending to the west (including Allen Park, Lincoln Park, Southgate, Taylor, Woodhaven, Brownstown).If Mr. Estleman is responsible for the incorrect definition, it will be my FIRST disappointment with him since I started the Amos Walker series. In any case, I look forward to finally getting a copy of this from my library and delving in."
2,not the best for lens protection,"This in reality is a small folding piece of rubber, definitly not the lens protection I wanted. I have not used it since I bought it as it seems worthless to me since it would do nothing if the lens was bumped or dropped and I don't think it would be large enough to even offer much glare protection..save your money and get a UV filter or different lens hood"
4,Lyrical but not enough emotion,"When I heard the Mutter recording of the Brahms concerto for the first, I was blown away by both her tonal purity and clarity and her emotion. Hahn as the tone down, maybe even better, but it left me unsatisfied emotionally."
2,"Good violinist, Bad orchestra","The recording is a miss- why didn't she just record with the Boston Pops, considering the lack of quality in the orchestra's ability to play both Brahms or Stravinsky? Neville Marriner turns everything into BAroque mush, and has done so here, amazingly.It's all the more disappointing having seen Ms. Hahn perform the Brahms Concrto brilliantly with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Hilary Hahn fans would do better to purchase the Barber CD.Those wanting an excellent recording of the Brahms should seek out Anne Sophie Mutter's recording with the New York Philharmonic.Better luck next time, Hilary."
2,not the best,"i was listnin to it but it wasnt the best i would say. it was likje borderline shwatrz but not even alll the way shwatz, i would say about 50 % but still not totally. its ok, though."
5,Hilary Hahn... simply dazzling,"An extraordinary CD.This disc has two great violin Concertos: Brahm's and Stravinsky's, both in D major.As one of the other reviewers mentioned, the Stravinsky is exceptionally well played. Although this piece is not as pleasing to the ear (at least to my ear) as the Brahm's, one has to appreciate the amount of effort and skill that is put forth by Ms. Hahn for this difficult work.Without doubt the Brahm's concerto was my favorite: I found Hahn's interpretation flawless. While I loved the first movement, played with all the power and grandeur that I think Brahm had intended, it was the third movement that absolutely captivated my attention. This allegro, with its beautiful, haunting melody is made even more incredible when accompanied and embellished by the orchestra. The work was played with such joyous abandon and energy that it was hard to believe it was over so soon... Breathtaking!A must have CD if you love Brahm's violin concerto in D major....Highly recommended!"
5,Great CD Awesome music,"Nocy keeps surprising us with his great guitar playing and his music. Lands Of Beauty is full of energy and passion, especaily when Nocy performs the US National Anthem at the end, it sounds awesome. Way to go NocyI recomend this CD to every one"
4,on friendship...,"quick and efficient, though the book did have a penned dedication in it already, along with several page markers. other than that it was a great find, and a great transaction."
5,"Beautifully done, novel style","Yes, it is technically an animation, but not what most people expect. I'd describe it as a continuous slide show. The frames are wonderfully done, the narrator very well chosen, and the style so well suited to a mythological story."
5,Delightful Movie!,"This is a delightful movie! The plot is well thought through and developed. The animation is very well done. The art work is very attractive. The characterization is well developed. Overall, a fun movie to watch for all ages."
3,Mixed emotions,I have ambiguous feelings towards this movie. I don't think I fully comprehended the meaning of the tale. I did enjoy the graphics and the characters but I was slightly confused towards the end of the film. Perhaps I need to watch it again to fully comprehend.
3,Good looking but superficial and obtuse,Some beautiful images but the story is both superficial and obtuse. No doubt those versed in Celtic lore (or those enamored of anything Celtic) will be able read some meaning into the film - but whatever they read into it won't be something that was in the movie.
2,Boring,"This is for children, not adults. I was very bored throughout the story and predicted every single action. The animation was not that good except in the Kells design. The characters were ordinary. Do not recommend for adults. It's a good children's story for older children."
1,Really? Tax Shelter Productions,"I have never written a review before, but this was so bad that I have to write something. This movie had no point. The storyline makes no sense. It's a good thing it was free. Tax Shelter Productions??? Really?"
1,Missed the Point,"While I agree that this is a beautifully animated movie in the spirit of early Irish art, it's all beside the point - how could the movie creators not understand what the early Irish monks meant by ""turning darkness into light""? The movie implies that the monks' efforts were to ""preserve knowledge through the time of the vikings"" - but they were not working on books of mathematics or history - they were creating Bibles. ""Turning darkness into light"" does not mean creating pretty pictures - it means sharing the ""light"" of God's word in places where it has never been. The movie was created around the lovely poem Pangur Ban but completely missed the reason for its loveliness and used the final line in a way that fails to communicate the true beauty with which the author was entranced. For this reason, and to my great disappointment, the Secret of Kells is exactly what its creators believe the Book of Kells was - a mere pretty picture."
1,Didn't work!,I tried it in a player that worked with other dvds but it didn't run. Sooo disappointed as it was at a camp and lots of kids were looking forward to viewing it.
1,Horribly anti-christian piece,"Wizardry and witchcraft. Weird. Not at all true to what this story is truly about. The book of Kells was a book of the Gospels in the Bible. This is not true at all to the story. The animation was cool, but we shut this off after about 50 minutes (much more than half way)."
4,lovely for the 'young at heart',"I expected an animated film, but was fascinated by the discussion included with the DVD. A lovely film for the 'young at heart,' but a little scary for very young children."
5,beautiful,"The DVD is beautiful to watch many times, seeming to be created by one of the monks who would have worked on illuminated manuscripts. The artists did a beautiful job. Sometimes the dialogue is a bit difficult to understand, but the art makes up for it."
5,Great movie!,"This is a wonderful movie...great music, story, graphic, traditions... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..."
5,A Gorgeous Visit to Medieval Ireland,I first watched this with my girls (4 and 7) after it was nominated for an Academy Award. I was absolutely blow away by the beautiful animation and song that wove the story of the Book of Kells. The use of the medieval style of illumination in the animation was a beautiful touch as a classic tale of Ireland is told.This has become an instant classic in our home and is watched frequently.
4,Excellent Movie,"This is a wonderful movie that my children (ages 4, 6 and 8) loved, however, it was a very quiet movie and they do have slight accents (and not all the accents are the same). Next time we watch it, it will have the subtitles on just to be certain of what they are saying. Beautiful movie that got my 6 and 8 year old interested in the real story of the Book of Kells."
4,"Short, cute, to the point.","I probably got to excited when I first heard about this movie. I was able to see it in theaters (yes!) back in March I think, at the Sarasota Film Festival. I pre-ordered the movie as soon as I could.It definitely is a good movie, excellent scene composition, interesting characters, but it was bit short.Overall I'm glad I bought Secret of Kells and I would recommend it."
3,Interesting Addition to my Animation Collection,"I would give this film 3.5 if that were possible but don't see it as a masterpiece by any means. I bought this film mostly because the artwork seemed unusual and I was exploring animation styles for a project I'm working on. The plot, while interesting is rather predictable and not very challenging. It also seems a bit rushed at the end where the boy suddenly grows up and brings the book back to the Monks. As someone else mentioned it is short, but then most animated features are. That didn't matter as much to me because I actually enjoyed the artwork more than the film. The idea of animating the symbols in the Book of Kells was exciting and I wished it would have played a larger part in the plot of the film. The short sequels where the symbols come to life are magical and belie its strong link to the natural elements surrounding the monks who created the Book. Those short sequences in which the book comes to life made the film worth owning for me."
5,The perfect book to read before going to an art museum!,"I love this book because you can quickly learn about all the major periods of art - from the Renaissance's oil paintings to today's modern sculpture works. I recommend reading this before you go to an art museum, so you can brush up on who is famous for what. There are a few black and white photos of famous artwork, but mostly the book explains the type of art produced during each period, and the top 5 or so artists and what their most famous works are."
5,The best in the series!,"We read all these books in the series together as a family. This one was our favorite. My boys couldn't wait for bedtime so they could hear what would happen next in the story. These books offer enough action to keep one's interest, young and old. I recommend all the books in the series. We can't wait for #6!"
5,Good addition to the series,"My 4th and 6th grade boys are devouring Greek mythology, and have enjoyed Mary Pope Osborne's books. The Sirens and Sea Monsters volume has been a welcome addtion to their mythology library."
5,Michael Parsons' views on global warming are extraordinary.,"Michael Parsons looks at the theory of global warming with the most intelligent insight I have seen in any of the literature on the subject. He uses hard core science to debunk the theory and leaves its supporters gasping for air. Unlike some who have come out against global warming, Parsons does not attack it from an anti-environmental perspective. Instead, he addresses the issue with thought-provoking arguments based upon research and investigation into the true science behind the theory. I wish we had more scientists like Mr. Parsons working in our country today"
1,Oil Industry Ties Weaken Author's Creditibility,"The author presents his case very convincingly, however the fact that he has received substantial funding from the oil industry, removes any hint of objectivity from his findings. It is clear that the oil industry stands to reap millions of dollars by postponing the enaction of any kind of public or governmentally imposed reductions in gasoline and oil consumption. Below is a paragraph from Greenpeace's website in Australia. Ross Gelbspan (""The Heat Is On"") has also exposed Dr. Singer's oil industry connections:'Fred Singer came to Australia in 1990 to speak on ""Global warming: is there a problem?"" and in 1992 to talk about the ""benefits of global warming"". He has received funding from Exxon, Shell, ARCO, Unocal and Sun Oil. In early 1995 Singer proposed to an oil industry PR firm a US$95,000 project to mount a lecture and publication campaign to ""stem the tide towards ever more onerous controls on energy use"". '"
1,This book is bunk - a collection of misinformation,"This book seeks to bebunk the very real and verifiable fact of global climate change. Its authors are idealogues, wholly owned by the fossil fuel industry, and have no scientific credibility. IF you want to learn the truth about what the burning of fossil fuels will mean for you rchildren read Ross Gelbspan's book - The Heat Is On."
2,difficult to read and oh so boring,"I was looking for a book about Anne, but ended up with a book about everyone else. I realize that to understand her, you need to know the situation and the culture etc., but this was too much. the last one quarter of the book is about Anne. It is very very dry and very boring and difficult to follow."
2,Careless with facts,"This book says Anne Hutchinson, the colonial leader, died ""in August or September 1643."" In fact Governor John Winthrop recorded in his journal on July 22, 1643, news of the Indian massacre in which Hutchinson had died. It's ironic that an author who describes Hutchinson as little more than a fiction of Winthrop's imagination didn't check this primary source. More important, this book claims Hutchinson's ""personal influence proved ephemeral"", and ""most of her followers"" and family ""died with her"" in the massacre. In fact, according to Winthrop and other contemporaries, she was survived by scores of followers in Rhode Island and Boston, five children, and many grandchildren. Her descendants include Presidents FDR, Bush, and Bush. Her lasting influence in Rhode Island contributed to the freedom of religion clause in the 1660s colonial constitution, which helped inspire the constitutional amendment guaranteeing freedom of religion throughout America."

3,"Great--that is, IF you like Banda!","I love Pedro Infante and I love these songs, BUT, I'm not crazy about the ""heavy metal"" sound of Banda. For those who like it, this is a great CD. Lots of heart-wrenching rancheras and boleros. Also some great comic numbers like ""Yo no fui"" --""Mama, yo te juro que yo no fui, tu me tienes creer a mi. No, no, no, yo no fui."" (Mama, I swear I didn't do it, you have to believe me. No, no, no, it wasn't me.) and ""Nana Pancha,"" about a pistol-packin', hard drinkin', cha-cha dancin' old lady. Buy this CD if you like Banda, but for myself, I want to find these recordings with their original accompaniments."

4,"The missing element in later ""Trek"" incarnations!","""""Adonis"" ranks as having the sexiest guest stars ever to appear in the Roddenberry classic. Michael Forrest, as the god Apollo, and Leslie Parrish, as the object of his affections, exudes some vicious heat in their respective roles.While the episode may not be an overwhelming ""classic"" to many, it still entertains and the cast seems comfortable in the rather outlandish premise.And the sexual tensions bouncing all over the place make this episode a standout. The subsequent series, while technologically more advanced and possessing better acting and writing, failed to ""ignite"" the basic sensuality of the original.Boy, did the original cast know how to ""have fun""!"
4,Nice paper at a great price,"I use a Canon i9900 printer with dye-based inks and needed a good 'luster' finished paper for some portrait work I do. I've used Canon papers and Konica (currently out of the business). This is very good paper for most types of printing. I have no complaints about it. The ink sets in well, with no pooling, or other bad effects. Prints dry very quickly and are ready to trim within a minute. Color is great. However, I can't seem to get good results using Ilford's icc profile. Prints tend to the warm side if I use it. Instead, I have a calibrated monitor, and I use Canon's printer driver software. I get consistently good results that very nearly match the image on my monitor. If this did not happen, I'd trash this paper, but thankfully, that is not the case. Weight (290 gsm) is perfect. The whiteness is a bit on the yellow side, but not bad. I'll be sticking with this paper for a long time."
1,Fades in less than 4 years - NOT archival,"With an Epson R2400 and Ultra Chrome K3 ink, I made twelve B&W prints of a family portrait on Ilford Smooth Pearl. I visited one of the family members this summer who had one of the prints on display. The inks are bleeding after less than four years! I'm having to re-do all twelve prints, which were museum matted and framed. I will never again trust ink-jet for photos that are supposed to last."
1,Corporate Rock Crapola,"Only one other reviewer had it correct. This is no better nor worse than Brittany Spears or Avril Lavigne. If you like that trash, then you'll like this.On the other hand, I do suppose it's better than Bruce Springsteen or Bon Jovi."
1,Punk?!?,"Are you serious? These girls are about as ""punk"" as Avril Lavigne. This Cd is a terrible choice of music if you really are into the whole ""punk"" scene. The music is very amatuer, only a slight array of different chords and the beats are choppy and irregular. Not only that, but the girls cant really sing either. And about making fun of that whole ""pop"" genre of music (""I'm Afraid of Britney Spears""), thats being very hypocritical for these girls are about as ""pop"" as you can get. I am very sorry for anyone who owns this garbage."
4,A sample of the best band in Canada.,"I've seen Danko Jones maybe 15 times live. They are one of the tightest, finest bands currently on the circuit. This is the only recording currently available of their stuff. Though it does not compare to their live shows, it is well worth picking up."
3,Not bad but........,"Don't get me wrong, there are alot of good songs on this album, Aunno Mundi being my personal favorite of the Tony Martin years, but where are the rest of the Martin era classics? ""Headless Cross""? ""When Death Calls""? ""The Sabbath Stones""? ""The Shining""? ""Kiss of Death""? "" Devil and Daughter""? Songs from Cross Purposes?... It was like the record company just took random (Black Sabbath IRS)songs and made a random cd!!! Why is Heaven in Black 1st? and why is the ""Gates of Hell"" at the end somewhere? Any Real fan of Sabbath would already have the albums with Martin, but if you are a new fan, this is a pretty good intro, but try to get ""The Sabbath Stones"" for a cheaper price and a much better song selection; and if you are one of those ""OZZY ONLY"" fans!!, either you don't know what sabbath is about or you don't know the half of what you are missing!!!"
3,its alright,"This is an ok controller that is pretty good quallity. There are only two problems I have with it though, first, it seems light the joystict isn't very sensitive, making it seem more digital, and, it doesn't seem to last nearly as lond as the nintendo brand. Other than that, its ok, and if you are looking to save a few bucks, this is a goodf deal."
1,A very irritating problem,"I had expected to be sent the the book with the dust jacket, which, as you can see in the picture, is beautiful. I would appreciate having that dust jacket sent to me.Judith Friedlander"
2,Old fashioned reference for the American-English speaker.,Has some good references for anyone who requires a translation of what can only be considered as 'Old English' into American-English. It is now very outdated with many of the phrases listed not having been used for 50 years or more. These phrases would only be useful to translate the black and white films of the 40s and 50s. The foreward and introduction have obviously been written by someone who has no idea of what a Country is or have inaccurate references to the point of almost being insulting to a native of Briton. Many of the listed words and phrases are also inaccurate. For some reason there are a few Australian-English phrases and words that have been added although they really should be the subject of a further book.
2,Chene anchor too light to do the job,"I bought this chene anchor because of the ads about increased bottom gripping with the 45 degree angle and ""less line required"" to set the anchor. This weekend it was too light to sink fast enough in moderate current in Galveston Bay and light wind to find the bottom in 20ft of water. The boat drifts off with the anchor suspended in the water column. In a sandy shell bottom in 4ft of water, it would not hold either. I believe the flukes are too short in sandy bottom. I am not happy with it, so it will be a backup anchor for my 14ft bass boat that stays in calm water. Real disappointed."
1,"No Good, Thumbs Down","100% useless - I originally ordered this anchor for my size boat. When it arrived it looked very small but figured it was so high tech, it didn't need to be larger. Well it took forever to hookup and it was never a solid hook. Re-ordered the largest size available thinking it just needed to be larger and heavier. Horrible again. Save your money!!! My Specs: 23' boat, North Atlantic (NY), sand and rock bottom. Failed miserably on all bottoms. Couldn't even snag it in the rocks."
5,Anchor away,"I use this anchor with my Sea Doo Gtx Limited. It is the first anchor that has held my PWC in all conditions. THe small size is also great. Sand, wind, rocks this anchor holds."
1,PRODUCT DISPLAYED AND LABELED IS NOT PRODUCT DISPLAYED,WINDOWS 2000 SERVER with five License is described as product for sale. This is NOT correct. The DISPLAY shows the WINDOWS 2000 SERVER box as the product to be purchased. Even the requirements make no metion of what is required for the product being sold.What IS be sold is the WINDOWS CLIENT LICENSE PAK. Which comes from microsoft with a COMPLETELY diferent container than what is being sold. This is the CLIENT LICENSE PAK only no software or manuls are included. That is because the product is WINDOWS CLIENT LICENSE PAK only. PLEASE CHANGE the title and your DISPLAY of the product to WINDOWS CLIENT LICENSE PAK
2,Safe but not challengin,Lincoln logs are one of the best building toys available. unfortunatly these logs are almost fully prebuilt. This removes quite a bit of the learning experience for the child. Children do not need the toys prebuilt. they should still need to do more than place the pre-built roof on a pre-built home. Lincoln logs needs to go back to allowing us to assemble the home the way we want it.
5,My Daughter Loves this set because it came with horses!,My 6 yr old daughter Samantha had just 1 other set (Frontier Fort) until she got this set for Christmas from my mom. She wanted this set because it had horses in it ao my mom went and got it for her. This is one of her main toys she plays with. She enjoys making the pasture for her horses. It also comes with plenty of logs to build with. We are making another trip to Toys R Us this weekend to get her one more set (with more longer logs in it) so she will have plenty to go around when friends are over and to be able to build larger buildings.
1,Appalling,"The quality of this book is appalling. It is printed on thin matte paper that looks like it was simply run through a photocopy machine. The images are so grainy that the ultrasounds look like they were performed on equipment from the 1970s. Modern cranial ultrasounds are beautiful with easily identifiable structures. All the images (both US and MRI) in this book are a blur and pixelated. The worst part is that the caption describes the normal structures and findings without any arrows or markings on the image itself leaving the reader to guess to which pixelated blob they are referencing. The entire book is printed in black and white rendering captions such as ""coronal color scan"" on doppler images utterly meaningless. The text is minimally informative but that is really secondary to it's glaring flaw. One would expect an IMAGING textbook to contain high resolution informative images and this book completely fails in that regard."
5,Mom might enjoy it more than baby!,This is a very sweet book that would make a wonderful baby gift or 1st b-day gift. It is one of those special books that will make mommy cry happy tears...
5,Best book ever!!!,This was the perfect book for my sweet angel. I planned for years to have a baby and that is reflected in this book. Such a sweet story of how much one can love their child! I was so pleased with this book that I will be purchasing several more for gifts :)
5,Wonderful book. one of my favorites!,"This is a BEAUTIFUL book, the illustrations alone are worth the purchase!The sweet story/love song is a wonderful story about how much we truly adore and celebrate our sweet babies birth, and lives.I read it to my baby girl all the time, and I will continue to for years to come! You will love this book!"
4,Very Switched-On,"Devotees of modsploitation will be able to turn on to this hip scene. Multiple food-fights set the broad comedic tone, while delightfully awful songs (including the hilariously over-produced ""I Can't Sing, but I'm Young"") remind us that 60's music didn't always have a leg up on current manufactured pop drivel. Austin Powers fans will recognize Michael York (AP's Basil Exposition) in one of his earliest roles as, of all things, a trendy fashion photographer in a mop-top wig. Need I say more?"
2,Silly Eye Candy,"Like a British cross between ""That Girl"" and ""Dumber and Dumber,"" this silly movie is memorable only for some of the groovy fashions and for a cameo by the UK band Tomorrow. Closer to ""Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In"" than a movie, it is not to be mentioned in the same room as the sublime ""Blow-Up."""
5,Bloody brilliant! A lot of laughs!,"You have to see this, if only to see a very young Lynn Redgrave! She and the always-talented Rita Tushingham are hilarious as a couple of young northern English lasses who decide to move to Swinging London in the middle of the 60's! Redgrave is a riot as a bossy over-bearing ego-maniac of a best friend, whose self-centeredness earns her all the bad karma she gets. Likewise, Tushingham plays to perfection the down-trodden buddy, the ""plain jane"" of the two who winds up, as all good underdogs do, well and truly on top! Best remembered as that weird 60's movie that ends in a meltdown at London's epitome of the swinging 60's - the Post Office tower - Smashing Time is fabulous, and I'm thrilled to find it on video in the U.S. Buy it!"
5,great prunes,"My wife and I have enjoyed the canned prunes from Oregon Fruit brand for many years, Recently our local grocery cut the prunes out of the line they carry. We were delighted to find we could order them direct. They add so much to a fruit salad for breakfast or lunch. LM, Redmond, WA"
5,outstanding paper,"If you buy printer-branded photo paper, you should move to this. It's amazing. Much superior.More expensive, but worth it."

3,Not for me....,This a nice radio and it is amazing to watch it set itself when you first plug it in. I live in Arizona and we don't mess around with Daylight Savings Time so this item it totally useless to us. Half of the year the time would be completely wrong because there is no way to disable DST. This radio should not be sold to residents of Arizona. There is another Atomic Clock Radio with a DST switch that is sold by a big name drug store that would be better for those that don't change time.
2,"Great features, but doesn't keep time","The one thing I want out of a clock radio is the abiliy to keep time. Even though I do get the atomaic clock signal where I live, it screwed up twice within the first 3 months I had it:1) One time, it jumped ahead 20 years. Only an issue because the day of the week it jumped to was a weekend, and since I had the alarm set to ring on weekedays only, it didn't wake me up that day.2) The other time, the clock suddenly moved ahead by 30 minutes.Unfortunately, since you can't disable the atomic clock feature, I can no longer trust this unit. However, I do like the features of it enough that I decided to buy another unit from Emerson without the auto time-setting function."
1,"No signal (two tries) in Atlanta, GA!!!","I bought this clock because I fancied the idea of never having to set the time. Also, I can read the time across the room without glasses. Received the clock in Dec 2004. I gave it several nights, but it NEVER synchronized with the atomic signal. Called the manufacturer. They told me that the clock was defective and to exchange it. I followed their instructions and received the replacement unit in Jan 2005. Second time, didn't work! I called the manufacturer again and the service representative told me to return the clock. I asked him if there's anything else I should try. He hastily stated, ""return the clock."" Emerson made no attempt to remedy the problem."
3,Very quiet alarm,"I really like this alarm clock except for the fact the the alarm is not loud at all, even the radio up all the way is not loud enought to wake me up. Other than that it is a great clock. It set the time quickly (it took about 10 minutes), and the alarms and radio are easy to control."
3,No auto-set in Kentucky - and this thing is huge!,"Very disappointed - after 3-days-wait, I gave up on it setting itself. We're on the 2nd story with our bedroom facing west. Also, this thing is huge... much larger than it 'seemed' in the product photos. Make sure you have room.Setting it up was easy, and the display is clear and the radio works just fine. It's quite unclear, however, how one stops the alarm (versus snooze) and that could be better labeled.Wishing it was available in black, also. I have decided to keep it just to save the trouble of returning it (and spending 30-40% of the cost of the radio on sending + my time.)Oh, yes, it uses 2 AA not 2 AAA batteries --- need to correct that, Amazon."
2,It Literally Stinks,"After enduring a bathroom clock that continually flashed the incorrect time because my girlfriend refused to set it, I purchased an Emerson CKA1100 atomic clock as a gag gift. What a disappointment, not only could I not get it to auto-set but from it eminated the most horrendous odor. For over 3 weeks we thought that her young boys had missed the commode when urinating, that there might be something wrong with the toilet, to thinking that something had gotten into the attic space over that bathroom and died. We finally isolated the rank smell to the new clock, Phew. I was ordered to get the clock out of her house."
2,Not AA not Slim... low quality,It has a AA label on it... but it ain't AA.. I own a bunch and it's just not their material... or is it their quality of slim fit
1,Not really american apparel,"I ordered these just before atrip, and stuffed the package in the suitcase so I'd have enough shirts to last; Imagine my surprise when I pulled them out in the hotel room to see that they weren't american apparel. Low quality fabric, not even sized right."
1,Bad shirt,"Shrinks a lot in the wash. Got a large but it shrunk to more like a small/medium after one wash, so now I only wear it as an undershirt. But the material is so thick that it isn't a very comfortable undershirt. Would be a good shirt it it wasn't so tiny."
5,Burberry and Calvin Klein T's are dead to me,"As promised a high quality shirt will never go back to Burberry Calvin Klein T's, these are cheaper and better quality. Go figure that we can actually do something right in this country, great shirt, worth every penny."
4,good quality,The shirts are made of a good quality cotton. They are definitely heavier cloth and better stitching than the typical 6pack tees you normally find. I bought these because they're made in the USA and much better quality than the ones they have at the base uniform shop
5,Great Shirts,These shirts of of great quality and fit very nicely! I ordered 4 of them to wear under other shirts/dress shirts and around the house.
2,SLOW shipping on some items,"Great price for American Apparel products. Unfortunately, it turned out that they didn't have 1/3 of the stuff I ordered. Then they shipped a bunch of the items really late (two weeks). They told me it was because they're new inventory.They really need to update their Amazon posts to reflect what is CURRENTLY in stock!"
2,Poor Quality Control,"I purchased a number of these shirts, because they were made in the USA. However, there were defects on some of them, and when I tried to return them to the store, I was told that there was nothing that they could do about the defect because of company policy. I took the loss and will never do business with American Apparel again. They would rather lose a customer over a manufacturing defect, than to just replace the shirt and keep a happy customer."
3,Andrew Christian T Shirt,"I ordered one small t shirt, and it took over a month to get to me. I am disappointed that Andrew Christian didn't make the shirt; it's just a plain American Apparel shirt. As far as the fit goes, it is long, and the sleeves are disproportionately big, and it's tight across the chest. The neck is small, but I prefer shirts that way."
1,POOR quaility & Over Priced Shipping NO CUSTOMER SERVICE,POOR quaility & Over Priced Shipping NO CUSTOMER SERVICE !The shirts were of poor quaility.They don't respond to any emails.I would never order anything from these people again.
2,Not as advertised.,"It is not ""fitted"" at all. It is square cut. I put it on and it was too small in the chest and too loose around the waist. Do not buy if you are in legitimately in shape."
1,"Wrong Items Shipped, No Customer Service. AVOID AVOID AVOID","If running a clothing company involves shipping the wrong items then avoiding your customer's emails, I'm gonna enter the business and revolutionize it. Maybe make a few millions.Andrew Christian blows. I'd much rather go to an American Apparel retail store and pay twice as much than shop through them.Do the right thing and learn from me..just avoid this dump at all costs."
1,mazda,this product does not fit the 2002 Mazda Tribute which it was suppose to!!! It was very frustrating. Please don't purchase if you own a Tribute.
4,trance culture,"Trance Allstars is at the top of the list for a good house trance CD. There is some classic tracks and then there are the few that are rare and anyone will want to hear over and over again. I recommend it to anyone who just new to the electronica music and want to get to know the basics, or to anyone anyone who wants to remember what it was like from the beginning. Enjoy!"
2,Too many inconsistencies,"I have to chime in and agree with the other reviewers who pointed out the many inconsistencies in this book. I kind of like the h/h and the relationship, but there are so many details that just don't add up. I couldn't figure out the villains - there was a three way conversation among them but supposedly one of them had killed the other years before? This and the other details others noted bogged the story down and should have been caught in editing. I give it two stars because I liked the two lead characters, and loved the private investigator and his crazy outfits. I'd like for him to have a story."
2,...,"I agree this book was really not that great. But it was my first Ashworth book, so I'm not giving up."
4,good bike,"For the price, it's a good bike. Sturdy and easy to assemble, it has 15 levels of pressure, the chair is also comfortable. The only real downside with this design is no exercise for the arms, but this design allows the bike to not break as easily."
5,wonderful for thin hair,"This product is wonderful for anyone who has thin hair. Always leaves my hair soft, full, and never ever flat. I have been using this product or over 4 years, and I would be very sad if I could not get it. I have never had to change conditioners because my hair got over conditioned or flat. My hair always looks full and healthy. I am 68 years old, I color my hair, and there is no problem with the color changing. This product, for me, is a true keeper."
1,"GARBAGE, don't buy!","Purchased two of these cables, one for my SNES and one for my N64. Both cables produced horrible results, the shielding is inadequate within the s-video line and produces a checkerboard pattern across the image. Using the normal component output produces normal image results, but the point of the cable is to use it's s-video line. DO NOT BUY! IT'S JUNK."
1,Didn't work!!!,"First of all, the cable I received was not the cable in the picture. I was sent two separate cables: One with S-video and two composite audio cables, and then one that just had the three composite cables.This would have been fine, except for the fact that the S-video cable did not work at all. The picture was horribly distorted and filled with static, making games simply unplayable.The audio was equally bad. There was a loud humming noise over the game's audio, which is unacceptable.I went ahead and ordered an official Gamecube brand S-video cable, for just a few bucks more. Trust me... It's worth it! Don't get a third party cable when the real brand name version is only slightly more expensive!"
5,Simply the best book i've ever read on Personal Finances,"Buy a copy of this book for your friends and family. I have given a copy to most of my friends and family as wedding gifts.In a clear, easy to follow manner it lays out the basics of personal finances that most anyone can follow. Perfect starting point for everyone. Enough information to make plenty of decisions for most people, for the rest of their lives.You could read lots more after this, but you won't learn much more beyond what it covers."
5,Failure to read this book IS failure!,"Agreeing with other reviewers, that this MUST-HAVE information is presented in easy and enjoyable reading, I found that it also MOTIVATED me to do the very steps recommended. I am buying it for all of my adult children and will have the latest version for my grandchildren when they graduate.Having been a financial consultant to others, I didn't follow my own advice. This book caused me to set the plan into ACTION, the missing ingredient for most of us.If you don't have it, get it (Amazon's price is great). If you did get it, read it. If you did read it, do it. You WILL be financially secure!"
5,Excellent book to teach the importance of saving and the effects of compounding interest,"The Wealthy Barber is an excellent book to teach people new to investing the importance of regular investing and the effects of compounding interest.I have bought this book for several people over the last couple of years. I ask them to read it before I help them with their investments, especially when they are interested in retirement accounts.This book is a very easy read. It tells a story and is a quick read.I would recommend this book to anyone who needs motivation about preparing themselves for retirement. Especially younger people."
3,Good Book,Would of been better if the book was ported to a Canadian version so I could understand the chapter about Life Insurance a bit better.Overall good for basics of saving and RRSP.
3,Great advice horribly written,"The writing is as bad as the financial advice is good. Page after page of cringe-inducing prose. A tragic parade of verbs attempting to take the place of ""said."" Dialogue, characters, and scenes so phony that the whole embarrassing exercise is called into question. Yet......the financial advice is perfectly sound. In some cases it's even insightful and, depending on the reader's background, potentially life-changing.One might wish wholeheartedly for a better executed narrative, but at the end of the day, Chilton deserves credit for what he does accomplish: Those willing to slog their way through his material can definitely benefit, in some cases greatly."
4,Good book,"The book uses the story approach to teach you something, and does it well. The storyline keeps you interested, so you don't fade off reading boring financial info. I learned a lot from reading the book, and have read about 3 or 4 other personal finance books that have been pretty redundant in information."
4,"Good Book, Too wordy","This book contained several gems of advice. Save 10%, make a will, buy the right kind of insurance, check out real estate investing. Good stuff. This information was unfortunatley jam packed into a story about a couple of barbers and some young people. I found myself desperately trying to find the important sentences in a sea of sports commentary and bad jokes. It was unfortunate.What I came away from the book with was a sense of validation. The advice in this book has been far better explained in other very good books, two of which I highly recommend. ""The Richest Man in Babylon"" and ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"". This book made me feel like others I've read were right.Overall, good book, could have been smaller."
3,Wasn't all it was cracked up to be,I had heard so much about this book that I decided to buy a copy and read it for myself. I was quite disappointed. I didn't like the storybook format because you cannot use it as a reference later on. The people in the book are either bachelors or barely married with only one couple having a child on the way. Sorry but some of us have only one salary and many kids to feed and educate so the casualness in the book about it being so easy to save for the house of your dreams or that great motorboat simply is not realistic. It doesn't go anywhere near the nitty gritty many people need to make ends meet.
2,CUT to the chase!,"My main problem with this or any book for that matter, is that this book contained makeup stories that bored me to tears.Our time is valuable, we can figure out a message when we read a book without any storytelling!I tried reading this book several times, but I got so distracted.I know the author states in the beginning he was doing this to entertain us but believe me, these stores were NOT entertaining at all.The author did have some good advise about life insurance, stocks, mutual funds, automatic investing.The second problem I have with this book is that title. I'm not sure if you can become wealthy after all these strategies.Yes, maybe in 40 years when I retire. If I'm still alive... In the meantime, what?"
5,"Well worth reading, unless you're already an expert.","I tend to agree with most positive reviews on this book, so in the interest of not being repetitive, I will just say this. It's concise enough to read in a day or two, but has just enough solid information to get you moving down the road to financial responsibility. I highly recommend the book, especially for anyone who tends to shy away from more ""structured"" books on financial planning and just wants some basic sound advice."
3,Great advice,"This book is full of great advice. For example: Pay yourself first: 10% of your gross income in mutual funds. Keep investing the same 10% in the same way, and don't fiddle with it. Through dollar cost averaging, you'll automatically buy more shares of the fund when it's low, and fewer shares when it's high.My only complaint, and it's a relatively small one, is the fiction it's wrapped in. Sophomoric. Pedestrian. It's really bad. But when I'm 65, I'll be giving credit to the author for my very comfortable lifestyle. So complaining about poor dialog in light of that fact seems ungrateful. But as Frank Sinatra said, ""If you're gonna tell a story about me, make it the whole story, warts and all."" And, warts and all, I recommend this as a life-changing book."
4,Every young person should read this book,"I bought this book for my newly married daughter to give her some basic financial advice in a clear concise story. I read it years ago, and it made sense and gave some sensible and simple steps to creating wealth. If only I had read this book when I was young!"
5,Really great,"This book gives you great financial advice, at some points kind of ripping off The Richest Man in Babylon, but unlike most of the other financial books I've read, it dives into insurance and wills too, which, although not as interesting as stocks to me, are also important subjects. Also, I think that investing in ETF's is better than investing in a mutual fund, but ETF's weren't as big of a thing when this book came out."
2,A let down,"This story begins well, but then loses track and becomes formless. The main character moves from one situation to another, and it becomes too drifting."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Political office gets old.Hope has had enough of being a literal space tyrant, and stepping down from that role decides on a new direction. An approach with a bit of a lighter touch he becomes interested in technological innovation and exploration, and also to try and use his talents in his remaining years for more directly beneficial political activities."
3,Following the series,"I started this series in high school, just decided to finish it. I like the book, it brought back some old character friends. My favriot is still mercenary.ThanksL"
1,Crap,"I think True Crime is an excellent action game. However, I feel the soundtrack is extremely lackluster. Most of the songs sound the same, and aren't really that interesting. Even worse, my favorite songs from the game(such as the one that plays during the spa shootout or the music from the battle with Kim) aren't even on the CD. Personally, I think only extremely hardcore fans of the game should check it out, the rest should stay away."
5,TMJ RELIEF,"This DVD was done very professionally, and had alot of expert content.I was surprised at how many methods could help those who suffer from TMJ.The methods shown could also help with other conditions as well.Thank goodness we can use these simple methods and not have to rely on pain pills. Great DVD."
3,Dissapointing,"While the information contained in the dvd is useful, I was under the impression that there would be a lot of hands-on work instruction included. Instead, the information mostly revovles around the two instructors telling you how to live a more healthy lifestyle to support tmj health. There is only one tiny segment of the entire dvd that shows actual manual techniques. If you are looking for techniqus this dvd is not what you should buy."
4,Forgotten but well worth remembering,"Simone Simon doesn't take the title role in Mademoiselle Fifi - that dubious honor goes to Kurt Krueger - but it's still her best role outside of the Cat People films. A rare non-horror credit for Val Lewton, it's a well-mounted and surprisingly effective combination of two of Guy De Maupassant's stories about passive resistance in the Franco-Prussian war that works as an effective WW2 propaganda piece. Simon's character may have been changed from a plump prostitute to a petite laundress (this was the 1940s, after all), but the first half, based on the story that inspired Stagecoach, is still a remarkably effective adaptation that segues comfortably into the second story, linking them both by a battle of wills with the titular bored Prussian officer who wants the population to submit to his whims purely as a mark of obsequiousness. Nicely directed by Robert Wise, it deserves to be much better known."
2,"Less talk, more rock!","The workout says it has a running time of 30 minutes, but is really about 20 minutes when you cut out all the unnecessary talking. Between exercises, I found myself sitting around waiting for instruction on the next move. It seemed like Kathy and her really awkward work out partner just kept going on and on about how great this exercise ball was. I don't want to hear all about the ball during a workout, I want to use it, save it for the introduction. The whole workout is choppy, disjointed and not so great."
1,Talk-Talk-Talk-Talk-Talk,A slow moving tape with so much talk that you can hardly stand it especially after the second or third time around. This tape is going to Goodwill. I hope they don't mark it too high.THEN there is Mikey! It's an embarrassment to watch he and Kathy flirting like Junior High kids. What was Kathy Smith thinking? Didn't she watch this sad act before putting it on the market?
1,This is a (bad) joke!,"I like other Kathy Smith's videos, but this balance ball workout is terrible... it's a joke! A bad joke. It's even funny to see Kathy's ball is too small for her!!! The routine is extremely boring and the guy in the video is mostly ignored by Kathy. I feel bad for him. Whenever he says anything she seems uncomfortable and just keep going without paying attention to him at all. And as he is shorter than her they look so funny. This really seems a sketch of a bad comedy or something. There are plenty of much better balance ball workouts out there. I only paid $.85 cents for this one but wish I would have bought a Kit-Kat instead. What a shame."
3,Rent this one,"Since this is Kathy Smith, you can be sure that it is well-researched, safe, and clear. In fact, for learning the correct form for stability ball workouts, it is hard to beat.However, it is a training session, not a workout. Unless you are very new to this form of workout, you will not feel that you have done much work. Your heartrate will not rise. You will not look forward to those slightly sore muscles the next day. And there is a great deal of talking and no music, so you certainly will not experience that ""flow"" enjoyment of the workout.There are lots of good moves, though, for abs and back in particular. There are some nice stretches,and several exercises I hadn't encountered in classes or other workout DVDs.I would say this is ideal for getting to know the stability ball and learning how to adapt moves for different levels of difficulty.Once you've gone through it, though, go to a class or try Lizbeth Garcia's On the Ball Pilates workout instead."
4,Great Lower Body and Abs Sculpting Workout,"In just 30 minutes you can have a great lower body and abs workout that is gentle on your body and still challenging. However, there are a few of things you should be aware of before getting this video: 1) you must have the right sized shaper ball. You should be able to position yourself on your hands and knees with the ball between your torso and the floor. My shaper ball is too big, so I am unable to do any of the ""beginner"" versions of the exercises. 2) Definitely wear shoes while doing this video-Kathy recommends it, but I tried barefoot anyway. It was way too challenging without the traction shoes provide. 3) Also, it helps if you have a wall within visual range of your television. One exercise puts the ball between you and the wall. Once you have all this in order, it is a great workout! The air cushion the ball provides makes many traditional exercises more comfortable to perform, while actually giving them greater effectiveness."
2,not that great,"This is not one of my favorite workout videos in the world. It is sort of annoying. She does it with this one other guy who is very muscular and looks like he just got at of high school Kathy and him, whos name is Michael, treat each other like they are high school swwethearts. One thing that I like about it though, is that they show the exercises in three different levels, beginner, intermediate, and advanced. That way you can work at your own pace. I never really feel like I have exercised very much when I use this video, though."
2,POOR WORKOUT,"Kathy Smith, why on earth did you use a ball too small for your height? Stability balls come in different sizes for your height. Knees should be parallel with hips. There are other ball workouts out there that are better than this one."
1,pitiful,"not a good exercise routine, Smith is past her prime and her teaching style is lacking, she needs to step aside and quit producing weak videos like this. The moves were overly talked out and the seemed very boring. Smith was good, was! Leisa Hart is so much better, try her On The Ball Abs video instead."
3,I expected more,"I have many of Kathy Smith's tapes and enjoy each one of them. When I saw that she had a tape on using the shaper ball, I was ecstatic. I bought it, got prepared to workout and I must say that I was disappointed. I expected more from her. The video is too short, the exercises are not done for a long period of time and I didn't feel anything at the end. The only good thing about the video is it acts as a guideline for exercises you can do on your own. She gives you quite a few. I recommend that you do the exercises on your own and for a longer period of time. I found this helped me. To sum up, buy the tape if you are looking for a guideline and exercises to try on your shaper ball. Do not buy the tape if you are just going to follow the half hour routine."
1,I wanted to like this video.....,"I would not recommend this video to anyone who wants to work their abdominal muscles. There are only a few very basic exercises that, unless you haven't exercised in 10 years, will not give you results. I am new to the shaper ball but could perform these exercises at the advanced level and still not feel a thing. The only part of the video that was slightly interesting, although just as basic as the abdominal & lower back portions, was the lower body which involved leg lifts & squats."
3,"Not his best, but worth a spin","For me, Marty Stuart rarely quite translates to disc. Everything always seems slightly tame, a little too clean and antiseptic and this is the case here, too. It rocks some, it swings, but it never threatens to completely cut loose or loose control, and this type of rockabilly cum hillbilly needs to have an edge of that to really breathe. Stuart, I think, was then, and remains, too much of a craftsman for his own good at times. This is certainly enjoyable stuff; it just never really grabs you by the lapels like it seems to me it should."
3,Average,My little one found this changing pad very comfortable. It's also easy to clean. The only problem with this product is the security strap doesn't work. We couldn't get the belt to stay together.
3,If you really need it buy...,... it. We think afterwords it was not necessary. It is bulky. You could be more happy with a portable since it is more useful.
1,bad book,This book gave the reader no information abot the cluture and History. I would not recomend this book to any one!!!
5,Cricket Static Free hair brush,"Exactly the brush I had been searching the shops for to replace my 20 year old one exactly like it So glad to see they were still in production I ordered 3 of them and have them in bath and bedrooms Love it, and product arrived so quickly."
5,best brush ever,I have a great deal of extremely fine hair. It tends to break off and be difficult to control. This is the best brush I've ever found for my hair type
5,Wonderful Nostalgia,"As someone who was born in Texas in 1944 and lived their until age 12, this music is very nostalgic for me. I saw several Tex Ritter movies as a kid -- as well as those of Gene Autry and Roy Rogers -- and my mother often sang the songs of these great singing cowboys while working around the house. So, hearing them again takes me WAY back.This CD is discontinued, but I was able to get it from one of Amazon's associated dealers. It's a great collection of western songs by one of the greats. Was his voice great? No. Were many of the songs kind of hokey? Yes. Is it wonderful? You bet.There's not a bad track on the CD -- although each listener will of course have his/her favorites. I like ""Ride, Ride, Ride"" a lot, and ""Sing, Cowboy, Sign"" but I just love ""High, Wide, and Handsome"" because I can picture my mom singing it. She loved Ol' Tex.Now I guess I'll actually rent some of Tex's DVDs and maybe even by a few from Amazon!"
1,Poor Quality,"We had a set of Chicago Cutlery knives for many years and thought they were good quality. Over time, the wooden handles dried out and the blades didn't sharpen very well. So we replaced them with this set, but were very disappointed. The blades rust after very brief exposure to water. We are still using the old ones."
5,"Great value, unique workouts, good challenge.","This is a great DVD with all kinds of different workouts, some faster paced and more challenging for those adventurous days, and some that are more relaxed for the tired days."
2,Irritating,"I just got this DVD and after following one sequence, I gave up on it.I have the impression the DVD's made to watch rather than follow along. Various annoying things like ending up on your mat facing away from the screen, and mostly she doesn't explain everything she does, so you constantly have to look up at the screen to try to follow. Give me Rodney Yee any day."
5,great buy.,"Got this dvd as a present for someone who is into yoga, they loved it and so did i, bottom line, great buy."
5,Shiva Rea Daily Energy yoga DVD,"I love this DVD! Most yoga classes I have been to last for 90 minutes, and I usually don't have time in my days for that. On this DVD there are 7 20-minute practices that you can supplement with warm-up, extra practice and shavasana, or just do the 20-minute practice if that's the only time you have. I was surprised at what a good workout just the 20-minute practices can be. All 7 of them are excellent. On the mornings that I do one of these brief practices, I feel more centered, younger and supple throughout my day. However, you probably need to have at least some yoga experience before you order these tapes because Shiva Rea doesn't provide very much explanation. The practices are do-able, but each has a challenging pose or two in it that I am unable to do yet. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who already knows some yoga poses, but doesn't have time to attend yoga classes on a regular basis."
1,Not my kind of yoga,"I've been doing yoga for years, and I just found these routines didn't capture any of the things I like about yoga. The movements are often very complicated and the instructor moves so quickly through them that it is hard to follow. Also, the movements are more akin to fluid dance moves than yoga postures that help in stretching. I understand the concept of vinyasa, but I have found the flow of the breath better captured in other DVDs such as Yoga: Gentle Practice. Also the music played during the routine is loud and distracting. Finally, the instructor talks incessantly during the routines and tends to add a lot of abstract comments meant to capture the spirit of the session, but I found all of this talking distracting as I was trying to keep up with the movements. I am returning it to Amazon for $2: it's not even worth that much to me."
3,Very Female Oriented,"I bought this DVD on the basis on Shiva Rea's reviews and standing as a Yoga teacher. However, her approach and practice is extremely geared toward female practitioners and I don't recommend for guys who don't like ""fluff"". Mind you, I'm not disputing the effort required, just the style and orientation."
5,Great Yoga practice,I love yoga.I used to practise in a studio but due to business obligations i don't have the time to drive to astudio after work. I bought many different dvds to practise at home. This by Shiva Rea is by far the best. You need to have had some Yoga experience before she does not explain in details her asanas but if you do have even a little bit of experience you are going to love this. The matrix feature is great lets you create your own practise depending on how you feel.Highly reccomended.
3,YogaLady,"If your looking for a full yoga class experience, this is not the video for you. There are a few segments you can choose from with this video. None of them have the starting yoga warm-up, or ending stretching and cool down. If you are just wanting to get down to business and do the standing poses and many chataraungas, then this is your video. The nice part of it, yes sometimes (many) I am timed crunched and only have time for this part. Shiva Rea Yoga Shakti is her best work in my opinion. I have several of her videos, and that is the only one I really love. I am a strong yogi. Shakti offers challenge. This video really does not, but is still a good workout. This is a video for intermediate yogis."
1,Not vinyasa flow,"I guess I am the only person who did not enjoy this dvd.It felt more like a modern dance class than yoga.Shiva did not do any prep to open up the hips and thighs before moving into some fairly advanced poses. She also didn't hold any pose long enough to really be able to breath into them and her instruction was basically non existent.There was no ""flow"", the transitions from one pose to another were cumbersome and unnatural. At least in the practice I did, which is the 51 minute water-heart-air-forwards bends, there were no true vinyasas - I would not have called it ""vinyasa flow"".I am a Yoga Instructor myself and, after hearing so much about Shiva Rea, I was really looking forward to getting this DVD. I truly wish I could have given it a more positive review. I let a couple of my students try it also and they too did not enjoy it.Perhaps it is because I am used to a more Ashtanga based practice, but this really didn't feel anything like yoga to me."
2,Shocked at all the glowing reviews,"I would consider myself an advanced beginner in yoga. I've taken classes for several years but don't have a consistent practice. I really, really disliked this dvd for a number of reasons.1. There are advanced moves done with little explanation or modifications offered. I can't do Standing Splits, but this was thrown in out of nowhere with no modifications and I thought that was crazy. There are a couple of other poses (including ones she seems to have made up herself) that require extreme flexibility and no modifications.2. I've had some hippy dippy classes, but all of the free form movement in these segments is really out there. I felt kind of ridiculous in my own basement.3. My biggest complaint: there is no straight up Vinyasa flow option. Since that's in the name of the DVD, I assumed there would be a pretty obvious, basic vinyasa class in there somewhere, but no."
4,Challenging,"Very classy and well done yoga video. Shiva Rea is graceful and extremely flexible in her movements. I thought I would be ready for the practice since I've taken yoga classes on & off for a few years; however, I found it to be very challenging. I have to start with the easier moves because my fitness level is too challenged by the pace of the video. In fact, sometimes my jaw drops when Shiva does one of those ""impossible"" poses! The Daily Energy series is practical because it is broken down into several different 10 - 50 minute segments to fit your schedule or energy level."
3,disappointing...,"I loved the other DVD, Flow Yoga for Beginners and hoped that this would be as good, if not more, and possibly a bit more challenging. Unfortunately I find myself waiting for something to happen...there's a lot of 'wiggling' movements-snake like-and I understand her thinking here, but I have an inner ear issue and too much of that makes me a little dizzy, so I try to add my own activities in between. I haven't tried all the practices yet--only 3, hoping that I can still find one that has a slightly faster pace and gets me moving at least as much as Flow did."
5,A must-have for every yoga-at-home enthusiast!,"This is an advanced yoga dvd for every day home use. Shiva Rea has put together some lovely sequences, each asana flowing into the next. It is both challenging and relaxing at the same time. The yoga matrix helps you create your own combinations based on what practice you want to do and how much time you want to spend. Shiva's voice is soothing and the music is very good. I have just watched this dvd once and done 2 practices. I love it!! Over the past few years, I have picked up many 15 & 20 minute yoga workout dvds. But this one is my best buy!! At this price, it's a must have for every one who practices yoga at home."
5,Love this!,"Ordered the Shiva Rea: Daily Energy Vinyasa Flow Yoga. This is for people who have had some yoga and know what the poses look like. I love the preset practices, but really like the matrix so you can set your practice to suit your time and decide which areas you would like to work on. Will definitely buy more of these types of DVDs."
3,No good for arthritic knees,"I bought this hoping to enjoy a more dynamic yoga routine, but I was just disappointed to discover that my left knee is too bothered by all of the kneeling that goes on in these workouts for me to do it. Also, this is certainly an intermediate level workout, so I would only recommend this to folks with already hard cores."
2,"historical trivia, amusing observations","It might be ""eye-opening"" and ""life-changing"" to a newly sprung, life-long religious cult member, but I didn't encounter much in this book I wasn't already aware of."
3,Nothing over the self evident and not funny,"This book attempts to do two things. One is to provide some insight into Hedonism, especially in the context of today's stressful age and goal oriented world. Unfortunately it does not offer any insights over and above the self-evident. Secondly, it attempts to be humorous. Unfortunately, does not succeed very well at this albeit the book does have quite a few humorous moments. All and all a mediocre book."
2,A few well-worded platitudes,"I found this book easy to read, but didn't find many insights in it. Although clear, the style was more flip than witty. The book design is attractive, but I appreciate larger type more than wide margins. I bought it for one cent (plus $3.99 shipping and handling) and agree that the price was fair."
3,Short and Sweet,"The book was short and good hearted, but was more of a brief history of hedonism with a splash of advice. It did have good sugestions but I felt the author repeated himself often. The book could have easily been a third of the length and not have kept any material out. The book gets a three for it's good intentions."
5,"Refreshing book, makes stop and think for a second","I grew up with the notion that hedonism is a bad character trait and has to be avoided at all cost (it even made me hesitate for a moment picking up the book from and checking it out), only to end up in the extreme workaholic, career-chasing crowd of today's America. I picked up the book because I felt something was wrong with the way I was living my life. And it was just the right book for that situation: it examines the silliness we all have put in our life, as well as the misguided puritan and martyrlike behaviors of the other extreme and advocates a way of healthy balance between focusing on what's important in your life, without going over the edge on either end of the spectrum. Well done!"
5,But this book!,"Every once and awhile a charming little book comes along that leaves you refreshed, and maybe a bit giddy.This is such a book, it is one of the best and least expensive vacations I have ever taken. At the end you want to take the author out for a great time just to say thanks. I owe him two because of his last book as well.Many of my friends will be getting copies this holiday season."
5,Pleasure Isn't About Going to the Club,"Having just finish reading the book, The Hedonism Handbook is a helpful tool for anyone who is looking for some leisure time be it alone or with anyone. It comes at the right time because as economic prospects look grim, there shouldn't be any reason to be grim. It is a great time to discover yourself, let loose and have some fun. The Hedonism Handbook does help one prepare for their time away from the rat race that so many of us are trying to beat only to be lose. This little handbook tells us that it is time to take a break from work, the people we associate with all the time, and let ourselves explore the other side of us that is desperate to come out."
5,"Nice, relaxing read for any hedonist (or someone who strives to be one)","This book was just what I needed to take my mind off the stresses of school and work, albeit for a mere few hours in a day. I really enjoyed the author's playful and light voice throughout, peppering us with little interesting tidbits about the benefits of ""sins"" and pleasure.It is also a philosophical book, expounding the virtues of pleasure while still emphasizing the need for balance in order to be a true hedonist. This will definitely be re-read by me when I need another jolt to remind myself what life should be all about: pleasure and joy!"
4,Great Product,I love the product it does contain Diazolidinyl Urea as an emollient. I am not allergic to this substance so I am fine with it. I use this product daily and it has done wonders for my skin.
1,What this page does NOT tell you...,"WARNING: Office Depot charges ""Small Order Handling Fee"" for many items. This item is 9+ dollars, and yet you will be charged OVER 10 dollars in addition to this if you order the item, making your order over 20 dollars for an item you COULD have just gone and picked up at the store. They do NOT tell you this ahead of time, and they don't warn you about it when you place your order, so you are charged double the amount of your order, and they don't even specify what makes an order ""Small Order"".AVOID Ordering from Office Depot online!"
1,Doesn't give you all the information !! Beware !!,"Shows a pic of MS Windows 2000 Pro, but what he doesn't tell you is , it was a restore disk from DELL Computers and WILL ONLY LOAD on a Dell Computer ! When Contacted, he said it would work, but it doesn't............... Avoid this scammer !"
3,Very cool.,"My boyfriend sent me the song ""Give Up Your Day Job"" earlier this year and it quickly became a favorite of mine. Very cool; I'm looking for more by this group."
4,An excellent textbook for the diagnostic radiology physician,"This most popular textbook for radiologist physics training courses (73% of market in 1989 AAPM survey) is excellent for the non-scientist who desires both technical and practical information. Needs to add sections on digital radiography, pulsed fluoroscopy, and CCD cameras, while reducing coverage of some fading technologies. This is one of the better textbooks I have used for any course."
4,"The prose isn't perfect, but the ideas are compelling","Even though Nisenson can be a less than pristine prose stylist, I found his book to be well thought out, and an effective manifesto against the current state of jazz. I attend jazz concerts frequently, and although the ""young lions"" are always appreciated by the audiences for their chops (and their nostalgia value), the performers who hit the audience hardest are those who speak with their own musical voices. This book helps to explain why, and also helps me answer my questions: ""Why can I never get enough Miles Davis CDs?"" and ""Why do I feel I've got quite enough Wynton Marsalis CDs?"" I suspect the one-star reviews this book has gotten here are due more to the reviewers' bias toward neoclassicism than a sound judgment of the book itself. Give it a try, and bring an open mind, something most neoclassicists don't seem to possess."
1,BE WARNED!,"I bought 4 of these light sets to string along the ceiling of my back porch, because the were the cheapest bamboo style string lights I found. It turns out that these lights DO NOT connect to one another. They are single string lights for streaming one at a time. Do yourself a favor and go to Target and buy the string lights they have that connect to each other. For $15 you can get the same 10-light strings as these and attach up to 4 of them together (they also have 20-light lengths for $25 each, in which case you can buy less and save some money)."
3,Caveat emptor,"This item was published in 2001 with a different cover, so if you have CDs by Frederic Lerner, check before you order. I don't know what the publisher's motive was in re-releasing the product with a different cover, but it smells of a rip off for those who haven't memorized their holdings. The CD itself is wonderful, and strongly recommended to anyone who does not already own it. A check on Amazon fr indicates that there are CDs not available in the US. How about it, Amazon us?"
1,White Rainbow - purchased from smshg2002,"The product was advertised like new; however, when I received the DVD it was well worn, with scratches and the box was broken. The DVD was sent in an unpadded envelope so the fact that the box was crushed would be expected by the sellor but not anticipated by a buyer.I sent an email to the supplier regarding my displeasure but there was no response.When purchasing on-line I expect the sellor to accurately describe the condition of the item. It was not accurately described and therefore I would never purchase from this supplier again."
2,Cracked in the dishwasher,"It worked well while it lasted. We mostly used it for portion control of beverages, so we usually wanted the 1-cup measurement, which can be a little hard to find amidst the busy-ness of all the other measurements.And then... we ran it once in the dishwasher (which we don't normally use) and it came out with a huge crack running around it, and this $10 purchase became trash."
4,Handy Size,"I really like the size, shape & the fact this is glass. If it had a little spout it would be 5 star."
1,Inaccuractely Advertised.,"After only two months of daily machine washing, those ""permanent"" markings have disappeared. I will not purchase this item again."
1,You must be kidding! Rinse it out and the markings are gone!,"I got this day before yesterday. I RINSED IT OUT!!!!! BY HAND!!!!! The markings are GONE over half this cup. This is cheap and not worth two cents, much less what I paid for it. I am demanding a replacement for it. I.Am.Not.Happy!"
5,Perfect - qualtiy product,Very nicely made. Fits together well -- no problem with leaking or sticking. Put both parts in the dishwasher and they come out fine. Great price. The measurements come in very handy - they have just about every measurement you can imagine.
3,I won't throw it away,"When I need three clean measuring cups, it will be my third choice.Much as others have mentioned, it was purchased with the expectation of some heat resistance. Like any measurement tool, it has a utility. In this case it might be the antique quantity citations such as ""gill""."
3,"Markings fade, but I'm going to buy again","I use this glass to make shaken cocktails with our metal shaker. I put the ice into the metal shaker, measure the spirits in this glass, pour the spirits over the ice into the metal shaker, place this glass on top, the cold inside creates a vacuum and allows vigorous shaking, then I strain a perfectly proportioned and chilled beverage into my glass. It is wonderful for this purpose. But the markings fade to the point of disappearing entirely after about 50 trips through the dishwasher, or a year of daily use without dishwashing. It is a quality pint glass independent of the markings, but I could buy a pint glass for considerably cheaper. I will buy again because it is so ideal for what I use it for, but I do wish that they would find a way to make the markings more permanent."
3,A great compendium of early to mid fifties jazz!,"This gets three stars due to its lack of material dealing with the current scene. The stuff on the fifties and and earlier is the main focus of this book, with some excellent discussion of particular players. It is Amerocentric, I guess thats understandable as jazz is an American idiom, but there is a lot of great jazz in Europe and Japan too.Perhaps a better title woudl have been ""The Oxford Companion to classic American Jazz."""
3,NY Dolls-LOOKIN FINE ON TELEVISION,"I'm wondering what the difference is (if any) between this new release of Bob Gruen's (bless his heart) and his last one. Hopefully not more grainy, distant muddy-audio footage! That was cool for a start when there was nothing else to choose from. Let's hope this has some of the undeniably cool TV appearances from their post-Murcia days!! From the description, it sounds like a lot of the same stuff we've already seen (the live stuff, the pool interviews, etc.) If it IS the same old same old, then dammit, let's smash down the doors of the vaults and let the gems be released. I'd hate to see Bob tryin' to drain more blood from the same old stone...between his book(s) and his last Dolls DVD, he'd risk becoming nothing more than repetitious. And THAT would be a shame! All I can say is: BUYER BEWARE."
3,English language version,"Take note that the DVDs I got say ""New English Language Version"" and Japanese is not one of the listed languages."
5,My Favorite Movies,These are my favorite movies of all time. I have even bought the posters a sword replica and photo books and costume from the movies for a full movie display in my room. Ueto Aya is stunningly beautiful in this and a great lead for both the movies. If you love samurai or ninja movies or just Ueto Aya this is a must see.
4,Does the job,"We've had this humidifier for 5 years anyway, andThese filters work great lasting a long Time. Price is right too"
3,"It's a wick, and it rots.","These ""filters"" wick up the water from the tray in which the water tanks sit and into which the tanks release the water. The unit's fan sucks air through these wick-filters and blows the moistened air out the top. So even if you clean the humidifier tanks and tray regularly and well, these ""filters"" are necessary for the humidifier to function properly. If they are not changed every couple of months they will mould and rot, and you will freak out."
5,They don't make recordings like that anymore!,"This recording was made at the 1970 Salzburg Festival. This is the earliest of three Don Giovanni recordings that Karajan made that are still readily available today. The sound quality is of course not nearly as crisp as with the later recordins (it was recorded live in performance 40 years ago). Some of the microphone placements create minor problems from time to time. But these small problems do nothing to dim the charm of what is a marvellous performance. The singers are wonderful (especially Janowitz!) and Karajan's touch, while not quite as polished as in his 1985 Deutsche Grammaphon rendition, never fails to delite. There are few conductors that grasp the dramatic weight that this piece demands and none that do it better than Karajan!"
2,THE ITEMS ARE BAD,I use this product everyday prior to purchasing at Amazon one can was in a liquid stage and did not spray one was half full one had the cover missing. and started to use it and it is not the same product no extra hold
1,i never reviced my book or my money,"the latest the order could arrive should be by September 8th 2010 and still it didn't arrive i pros pond my flit waiting for that order now , i am flying tomorrow morning on the 10th any thing beyond that i will not be able to receive since i am flying on the September 10th 2010. so please cancel and refund my money if it will arrive later than the 9th September on the order of Order ID # 1 of Bullyson and His Sons, if it will arrive beyond the date mentioned above (September 8th 2010) i would like to cancel and refund my order and money since i am no longer in the country. since i didn't receive my order up on the date September 8th, 210 and address agreed up on by both parties. and i was not notified about any thing till September 9th when i started asking where is my stuff. so for that reason i want a refund of my money since i haven't received my book . Note: I DIDN'T RECEIVE MY BOOK or my money yet till now. THANK YOU"
5,Keeps getting better,"I had one like this but covered with cloth. The thing came apart and the gel got all over and what a mess it was.I've had this one for almost a year and its as good as the day I got it. It's better in many ways. Its easy to clean if needed, doesn't move all over the place and it long enough that you don't have to move it around. Also, the gel doesn't move around inside like it does with others so you have the same form always."
5,A student of Ms Gold's.,"I was a student at this school, and taught by Elizabeth Gold. I was in the 9th grade class that she was thrown into mid-year after a handful of teachers who (mostly) failed after only a few days.Sadly, this book is based more in truth than many would even imagine, the scenarios that are described in this book are purely factual aside from the obvious name changes. Being such, this book was ""banned"" in the school, students caught talking about it, or having the book in their possession would find themselves in some hot water.Being a teacher is hard, yes. Elizabeth's tale was a nightmare, truthfully. I do feel bad, because I did watch her descent over the course of the year, but please do not review too harshly, this book may not be enjoyable in the way most books are, but thats because it is truth, and factual, and harsh, and real."
4,told this was great,"i purchused this for my daughter with vision then my vision impaired daughter used it while she was at home she loved it, so now i'm buying her one for her new apt"
1,Terrible,"My 85 year old parents bought this scale. It is absolutely terrible. The voice is so garbled that neither they nor I could easily understand it. A solid 2 on a scale of one to ten, where below six is flunking."
1,Cheap quaility scale,"This scale is cheap and it's almost impossible to understand the voice. I expected a clear, concise mechanical voice, but this sounds like someone talking in a tin can under water."
2,talking scale,This talking scale came quite promptly and is well-priced but the voice is shrill and very difficult to understand.
5,Ordered it but didn't need it,"I bought this book as part of a bundle consisting of the textbook, solution manual and study guide for my Chem 121 class. The item came as promised and in new condition and of course the price was much cheaper than the on campus bookstore. However, I found that I didn't need the study guide."
4,School book for Pierce College,It did the job at a low rate. Cheaper than the bookstore at the college. I buy all my books here.
5,great tool,The teacher did not state that i needed this book. But it was so helpful with chem 1405. I thank amazon for getting items needed at a great price.
5,Awesome!,"I bought this item for a Christmas gift. I did not view the item before presenting it to the recipient. When she opened the Amazon box, I began to pray that it was the appropriate size for her bed and that she would like it. When the box was opened and the set emerged, I began to pray that she didn't like it and that it would not fit her bed. This set was an amazing value and looks so rich. I came back to this page to order a set for myself. Why is it now sold out?"
3,"Pretty Set, but...","I really like this set, as it is beautiful, warm and cozy. I only have one negative thing to say about it and that is that the sheets pill. I would say for the price (I paid $29.99) and Free Shipping it was a good deal."
1,Not worth it.,"This accessory melted within the first 2 hours of playing while on a road trip. Nice idea, poor execution."
5,Useful product,I carry it with me while playing. It folds up easily and fits in one of my vest pockets. Easily used out on the field. Cleans the barrels on those rare occasions where the paintball bursts in the barrel.
4,multiple use item,Any paintballer who is worth their weight in paint should carry at least one of these on them at all times on the field of battle. I recommend one in the boot and one in your belt. Plus you can beat your kids with it and it doesn't leave marks on their skin. Seriously it's a good product.
4,Great,This is definitely worth 2 bucks (5 something with shipping). Fits perfectly in my 18 inch Apex barrel and cleans well. I dont think this is long enough for anything else longer than 18 though. I only rated it a four because i wanted blue like in the pic but i got white.
3,Just doesn't cut it,"This knife is comfortable to hold, a great size but is just not sharp enough. I tried to sharpen it but it just would hold the sharpness."
2,worst dvd out by psy,I been a down juggalo since 99' and don't wanna hate but this dvd sucked. The mec performance was decent but that's about it for me. The audio sound was jus too cracked n jacked up to enjoy. I love jcw and I witnessed the most disappointing matches ever. Mostly cuz gweedo and 3D dnt even commentate on any of it. The only reason it gets a rating above 1 is cuz it was cheap and mike clarks set was kinda dope.
5,This guy's good....,"I order many sax CDs hoping every once in awhile to get some good sounding stuff....not just a bunch of distorted honking about a quarter of a key off....THIS fellow (Cramer) is good....You can tell he's had ultra-training and expertise education....Hope you will give it a listen.....Also, e-mail me at enka@direcway.com if you know of any independent sax players CDs I might like....thanks"
3,Lovely idea but a bit spindly.,"Interesting spin on the classic challenge Tower of Hanoi. This product looks very nice from a distance but needs better construction. It was neither as sturdy nor as large as I had thought judging from the picture. Fine for an individual, but it will not hold up long in a classroom. The dowels used for the spindles are far too thin and not well attached to the base. The pieces are not well finished--it has very rough edges that need sanding. Increase the size, use sturdier dowels that are better secured to the base, and do the finishing well---then charge a higher price. I would definitely have paid more for something of better quality that would last."
3,Not their best release,"If this is your first Tom Petty CD, I could recommend about 6 others by him worth purchasing ahead of this one. It does have it's good moments though, such as ""Hurt"", the title cut, and ""Listen To Her Heart"". But the lyrics out rate the sound, as the music sounds very uneven. The good thing about this release is it paved the way for better releases by Petty in his post-70's career."
2,Not Quite Prime Time Yet,"A mixed bag this early release by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Most of the songs sound the same. Little variation in the arrangements oer the course of the CD.I Need To Know is one awesome tune though. It cuts right to the chase with a very catchy hook and good guitar and keyboards. Listen To Her Heart is another solid tune. The title track, Baby's A Rock N Roller and possible a couple of other songs are somewhat memorable. Otherwise, the impression is really quite ordinary at best."
4,Resonating Rock,"This album is worth its price for the opening track ""When The Time Comes"" alone - a jangling, flaming beauty of a song with a deeply emotional resonance and poetic lyrics that must count as one of the greatest rock songs ever written. It is truly Springsteenesque in its guitar-driven onslaught and addictive melody lines. Other great songs include the title track and the more tender ""I Need To Know"" while the intense ""Listen To Her Heart"" is equally catchy and memorable. The rest of the songs are good, solid rockers but none of them reaches the grandeur of these four classic rockers. I would strongly recommend getting this album as the above-mentioned opening track is not included on any Tom Petty ""greatest hits"" or ""best of"" album."
5,"After 24 years, my all time favorite","This CD remains one of my favorites of all time, I have purchased it repeatedly over the years because it has been stolen 3 times. I think it is Tom Petty's best effort and grows on you until you need to have it around. Even the songs you have never heard will find their place in your head."
3,A Little Undercooked,"This is Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers 2nd album. It's a good album that suffers from some problems. Of all the songs, only 4 stand out as classics. Those are YOU'RE GONNA GET IT, MAGNOLIA, I NEED TO KNOW and LISTEN TO HER HEART. The rest of the songs range from competent to good and none of them can seriously compete with their stronger hits. HURT could've been a much better song if it was developed more and is the only throwaway on the album. NO SECOND THOUGHTS is basically the same song with much better hooks. RESTLESS could've been better if the performance didn't sound phoned in. Other than those setbacks this album is filled with enjoyable TP&H material. Later albums find them a lot more consistent and producing more enduring songs. This is a great album to get if you are already a TP&H fan, but otherwise it's best to start a collection from this group with Damn The Torpedoes or Hard Promises. Those are more instant and offer a better portrait of what this band is about."
2,Not for me,"Contrary to the other reviews I couldn't use these. I am used to well contoured foam filled knee pads that stay put. I was looking forward to the ultimate with the new gel backing. Sadly the gel is put in as simple pillows and sewn around the edges. This fills what appears to be a very well made and contoured shell with mounds of gell, which I kept rolling off of, with my knees ending up to the side on the sewn seams. I tried everything but couldn't correct this. Since I can't work without pads [all day] I went back to the old ones and sent the gel pads back. Reluctantly. It wouldn't take much to contour the gel to solve this and they would be wonderful. I noticed at least one of the other reviewers mentioned slipping off to the side also. Great idea, not well engineered"
4,Best I've seen yet,"I normally spend one or two days a week installing Pergo flooring and have been desperately looking for knee pads that wouldn't do 3 things:1. Make my legs sweat like crazy 2. Pull the hair out of the back of my knees 3. Fall half way down my shins every other minuteThese knee pads fit the profile perfectly. After a 10 hour installation, I only had to adjust the pads twice. Both times they shifted to the side. The only knock I have: The pads are a little too hard and slide a bit on the Pergo. They could use more grip for leverage. Otherwise, they were perfect ""off-the-shelf"" kneepads for the price."
2,Disappointing,"It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the people who designed these knee pads never wear knee pads. They are very disappointing, although it would be very simple to make them better. The problem is that the curve of the knee pad is very shallow, and the gel pack is a single pack, not molded to the shape of a knee. Consequently, the knee rolls around on the pad which is almost as hard on the knee as not wearing pads. If the gel pack were shaped so as to cup the knee snugly, they would be fine. As it is, they are little better than a simple pair of pads that I bought for $9.00 in the garden store."
2,Too dark,"The poster is too dark. You can't even see the lady's dress below the bar. The poster is dark even in sunlight or with the light we have on the poster. Inexpensive, yes. But a great disappointment. The poster is not as bright or as depicted on the website."
5,great memories,"roman gabriel, greg cook, bob griese, sonny jurgensen, joe namath, craig morton, bill nelsen, joe kapp, daryle lamonica and len dawson. clean 4 all ages"
1,These things do not work.,"I have yet to successfully extract a screw with these things, despite several attempts. Save your money. I will say, however that the thing that came with them, that clips on your belt and holds your cordless drill, is very handy."
1,Broke on 2nd try,"Well, I was able to remove one hex screw from my primary cover on my 2012 Harley, but when I tried to remove a Torx T27 that holds the dust (durby) cover it broke off. Yes, It broke off.. Used the same drill and bit together but it broke off, now I have that screw there with a broken bit as well. Oh boy..."
4,did it's purpose well!,"After reading all the reviews and having seen it in tv, it does a great job.Been losing head screws for quiet a lot of job now and thanks for this small wonder i already replaced all of them. So far havent got any bad previews on this 1."
4,JUST WHAT I WANTED,"The Grab It Screw Extractors that I bought were exactly like on tv, but the delivery of them was excellent!! I did not have to wait for weeks to get them."
5,extremely detailed,This book was a joy to recieve! It is done in great detail and the pictures of instructions are magnificant! Worth every penny to anyone wanting to learn fabric embroidery plus instructions on watercolour painting on fabric.
2,Not her usual,"I also have read all of Meagan's previous books and am a devoted fan but this was not her best work. If this is your first time reading her work, don't hold it against her. I had a difficult time finishing this book. It did not flow well and she did not develop the characters enough. I would highly recommend any of her earlier books but I do not recommend this one."
2,"Fusion 5.0 ""beta""?","To be perfectly honest, I love Fusion but REALLY dislike version 5.0 at this point. It is beyond me why this product was released as it contains a number of bugs. As a previous version 4.01 user I was quickly impressed by the ease of use and ability to manage a large scale web site.One of my major complaints with version 5.0 is it's inability to publish to my NT server. I have to do a local publish on my hard drive and then use an FTP program to transfer all updated pages and files. This is a MAJOR pain in the...you know what for a large site. NetObjects changed FTP clients between version 4.01 and 5.0 and as a result I can't seem to use it to publish directly to my web server. (It does seem to work on Unix Apache servers however)There are a number of bugs in the new version, and in my opinion this product should not have been shipped yet. I know have a $100 upgrade that I don't even bother to use. Stick with 4.01... at least until NO issues a patched version."
1,Fusion 5.0 - more like ConFusion 5.0,"If you have an earlier version of Fusion, stick with it. If you are looking for a new tool to build your website with, stay away from Fusion all together."
3,American Bulldog comprehensive owner's guide,"Basicly a good book exspecially for someone new to the breed.I just didn't agree with authors verison of history of breed.Plus didn't give Mr.John D. Johnson the credit he deserved for is part in preserving such a wonderfull breed.Do your research before purchaseing this breed.It's loyal,non agressive,this dog will stand & protect it's family pack with it's last breath.Yet those of us lucky enough to own one or more knows it's one of the best breeds on Earth."
3,so so,its a little to text book for me... i noticed that the writer kind of rambled a bit but it does have some good info.
2,"Good book ,BUT !!!","This book is a ok book has some good tips and info that you can find in most books on AB's .The guy has no Idea about AB's , I mean the many theories of the breed and his negative remarks about other people's theory about the breed and not to mention writting mistakes in this book.But that just my though's on it!"
1,I cant believe this guy is published,"between his random babble, run-on sentances that lead nowhere, out of the blue paragraph openings and subject and not to mention his ""theory"" on the American Bulldog I wouldnt waste anymore time (let alone money) on this book. I mean come on, this guy spelled ""organized"" with an ""s"" for crying out loud. this book is an insult not only to the editors and publishers who helped put it out, but to the true American Bulldog lovers worldwide. I promise you that if you are looking for a good book on these dogs there are some out there - it's just not this one. after reading this i feel like i should write a book on space exploration - apparently you dont even need to know the subject on which you are writing about."
5,Will buy again,"Pyrex bakeware has been a part of my kitchen for years due to its versitility, attractiveness and ease to clean. These dishes go directly from the oven to the dining table and kitchen sink without a glitch. Cleaning is easy since baked on food/grease comes off easily without much elbow grease.This particular set is was hard to pass up not only because of its usefullness but its great price. I bought one set for myself and the others for gifts. The red accents not only coordinate with my kitchen, they provide a welcomed nonslip feature to the glass handles. The detailed pie dish provides a nice presentation at the table and the mixing bowl is conviniently sized plus the beakered end is a welcomed feature.Overall a great product which I highly recommend."
4,New Perspectives on Creating Web Pages with HTML,"I used this book for an HTML class taught entirely on the Internet and got an ""A""! The exercises are a bit time consuming and tedious, but well worth it for someone like me who has no programming experience. The text is straightforward using pseudo-realistic case study tutorials in a logical and sequential order. This is the comprehensive version of the New Perspectives series. There are also two other versions of this entry level text available in shorter versions."
2,HTML and Dynamic HTML,I like the way Patrick Carey explains things - he makes things very easy. This isn't my favorite book of his & I think you could spend your money elsewhere to be more up-to-date.
3,Too difficult mathematical concepts to introduce fluid flow!,"It is a recommended textbook from my professor, but it is also difficult to be introduced for 1st year students because it uses too many mathematical concepts for introducing the fundamental principles in fluid mechanics.Before you use this book, you should take some courses in mathematics, espeically in advanced calculus and vector analysis.If you interest in fluid flow and have good understanding in mathematics, it must be the best text book for you!"
1,Save Your Money --- Don't Buy This,"I bought a paperback version of this textbook a few years ago. There were many printing and typo errors (the top few lines on many pages were lost),and the quality of explanations in the textbook is disappointing for a group of authors from a supposedly distinguished university. Wanted to sell the book to recoup my loss but there was no market for it. Doesn't that speak volumes about this book?"
2,Not the most useful,"This book was required for a graduate introduction to fluid mechancis class. I found myself going to Fluid Mechanics by Potter,Foss and other books to clarify topics that Sabersky's book left unclear in my mind. Definitely not a good introductory book, I like it a little better now that I have more insight into the field."
1,12 PKS. OF 5 BAGS PER PKG???,"We received 1 of the 12 PKS. OF 5 BAGS PER PKG. What does ""12 PKS. OF 5 BAGS PER PKG."" mean in the description? To us it means 12 packages of 5 bags per package (equivalent to 60 bags). We truly hope that what we received so far is a mistake and that we can expect to receive 11 more PKS. If we cannot expect to receive 11 more PKS, then this is truly false advertisement."
4,simple and elegant-no longer japanese,very simple and elegant plus half the price at macys for the same items. no longer japan made but i guess it is the way of the new world order.
1,Worst video quality ever (Or since Hollywood Man),"When I heard this was being released I was very excited. When I popped it in my DVD player, I was so upset. TheVideo quality is pixelated like they downloaded it from YouTube using a dialup connection.The company and amazon ought to be ashamed of this garbage. It is unwatchable."
2,monitor,"Have this unit and have always had a lot of problems with it , always getting and error when the thing is inflating . The doctors office always seemed higher also the pulse counter was way off , it was reading a pulse of upper 40's and at the doctors it was 60 whicg is where it is supposed to be . Have not been happy with this , looking for a new unit ."
4,Dear Diary...,"This is Walter Koenig's journal of the making of the first Star Trekfeature film. Koenig, of course, played ""Chekov"" in the TV series and the movies. This is an interesting account of his experiences on the set of that first film. Star Trek fans should enjoy it."
4,Tom Petty CD,"Bought a bunch of Tom Petty CDs for my wife, as she is a big fan. It arrived in time and was in good shape, as advertised. Packaging was good and am quite happy with the purchase."
5,There is only ONE Heartbreakers - JOHNNY THUNDERS R.I.P!,"I love this Tom Petty LP, but goddamnit, there is only ONE Heartbreakers: Johnny Thunders, Walter Lure, Billy Rath, and Jerry Nolan."
4,You could hear it from the very beginning,"You knew Tom Petty was going to stay true to rock and roll from the very beginning. While not as sophisticated as his later work; TOM PETTY AND THE HEARTBREAKERS gives the listener every indication that this band was in it for the long haul. When you hear the first few notes of ""Breakdown,"" you know there is a darkness here, along with the skill to grab a listener immediately. Sure there are two songs with ""rock"" in the title, (always a concern)and the band's sound is far from consistent, but you can't hide the energy. A fine debut recording for one of America's great bands."
4,Tom Petty's Debut,"Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers for me, would be rated 4.5 out of 5.""Strangered in the Night""& ""Fooled Again"" are not my favorites and a bit raw but still good. Other songs make up for that.This really is an awesome album. Some songs are really fantastic: ""American Girl"" great music and lyrics. ""Hometown Blues"" fun & upbeat. ""Anything That's Rock N Roll"" says it in the title"" & more...This is not my favorite Tom album, but still needed for a Heartbreakers collection. Besides, it's Tom Petty, how bad can it really be?"
5,Oh yeah. Alright.,"This is the good stuff. The straight ahead snarling young man brand of rock and roll.The hits you already know (""Breakdown"" and ""American Girl"") and that's enough to justify this CD but don't miss the excellent lesser known gems such as ""Mystery Man"". The different styles on display here presage his later work but this stuff along with his other early records are imbued with that thrilling virile snarly-ness that us ladies just can't resist.In addition to the excellent music, there is some hilarious album art...TP and the HBs in tight leather pants with heavy metal hairdos and...shotguns? What a scream! Ah, we thought they were sayck-EEEE way back in the day. What were we thinking.Recommended for all fans of the straight-ahead rock genre."
4,A few great songs.,"This album has some timeless classics, as well as some more simple-sounding tunes. Which is understandable, since they were beginners at the time!"
2,Anchor does not hold,"After reading some positive reviews and the item description, I ordered this anchor because of its light weight and design. I have a 26' Tritoon. I could get the anchor set but when large wakes or a strong wind blew, it would drag and the boat would move. I could never get it to hold in those conditions. I bought a 13# fluke anchor and once set, it holds in all conditions. I would not recommend the Chene anchor to anyone. It was a waste of money!"
5,Loose Theads is really Good! By Bethany H.,"I read this book and really enjoyed it. I know the author of this book and I think she did a great job. Definitly five stars.This book is about Kay, a girl who lives with her mother, her grandmother, and her Great Grandmother. She lives in Florida. Kay finds out that her Grandmother has cancer. This is very hard for their family.I cried over this book. I recomend this book to everyone!"
3,Loose Threads,"I like her style of writing but the story was not I expected,I guess I expected more from Her."
1,Scam,"This so called making of Nirvana is nothing like it claims.Very little, if any, has to do with that classic album.This is an unauthorized release- so Nirvana is not features nor is any of the music.Total crap."
4,Works great!,I have had the product for over 10 years and it was past due for replacement. It has worked very well and gives great peace of mind.
1,Woodlands,"Was disappointed in the book, too technical and not enough ""meat"" at to the community. Purchased another Woodlands book at Barns and Noble that seems to be the only source for it and it covered the community organization and operation excellent. Would not recommend this book."
5,Awesome!,"I can't believe I was able to find and purchase this old gamepad. I LOVE it!I prefer the button layout to most other pads - the six on the top rather than 4 I mean. It also has quick response. Plugs into old-style gamepad ports, or USB via the spplied adaptor. It also fits my medium sized hands perfectly..the analog sticks are in just the right spot.If you google you can find Win XP drivers as well.Nothing bad to say about it! Great value!"
1,When even a fast fast forward just can't cut it!!!!!!!!!,Well this movie is by far the worst science fiction movie I have ever seen......I must admit I just couldn't take it to the point that I fast forwarded all but about 20 min.....Glad I didn't buy it!!!!!
3,The Black Hole,"I'm not a Sci-fi type person but since my daughter was in this one, I watched it. It was interesting and now I know that every sci-fi doesn't have to be bloody and scary! Go Jennifer. What's next?"
1,Not worth your time,"The two best things I can say about this movie are 1) it is very short, and 2) I rented it so can return it asap. I don't watch movies like this for the plot (good thing!) or the cast, but for the special effects. Which in this case means a whole lot of camera shaking. It makes no sense, there are way too many holes in it, and what in the world is up with Judd Nelson's hair?"
1,"Lack of Understanding St. Louis, MO","The setting of this film is St. Louis, Missouri, but betrays a total lack of understanding of how things get done here. First, hire an out-of-state consulting firm to study the problem. Then pay the company hundreds of thousands of dollars for the report. Finally, ignore the results. If a black hole ever really emerges on our city, maybe we can fill it with all the paperwork we generate to supposedly fix the region."
3,Interesting topic,"Something that should always trouble us, can we go to far? The subject is interesting but the story could have been stronger."
2,"It's a bread knife, but not a good one","After looking at the positive reviews for this knife, I was expecting a solid entry. It does what it's supposed to do: cut bread, but not easily or crumblessly. Even a fresh baguette requires some extra effort. If I was buying another bread knife (which I'm considering now after having had this knife for 6 months now), I'd definitely not get this one."
4,Great educational toy!,"My 3 year old son received as a gift and it's entertaining and educational! The pieces range from small, medium and big and different colors. As the person before said- it would be so much better if it were magnetic but either way, it's great!"
4,A must book for the amatuer to serious hood ornament collect,The book is a great resource for identifing old hood ornaments. The photos are clear and crisp.A no nonsense book. Mostly photos with very little wording.
5,Very nice,"I chose this bedding set because of the price - $100 less than the one I REALLY wanted (Team Snoopy), but I wasn't really digging the brown color in the bedding that the picture portrays. I thought, well, for $100 less I will deal with it. To my surprise it arrived and what appears to be browish red/burnt orange in the picture is actually a deep red...works out PERFECTLY in my son's room! I am very happy I made the right decision and went with this set. Adorable pattern and looks great!"
2,Poor quality,"My husband is a huge Snoopy fan (he grew up enamored with him) and loves sports, so this was the perfect crib bedding for our soon to be born son. I was so disappointed when we actually received it - the fabric was scratchy and rough - not the kind of quality I would expect and not something I would use for a newborn. This was sent back."
5,Beautiful!,"I am very pleased with this purchase. I bought this for my second born, and the colors are so vivid. Please the comforter and bumper pad are plush. This is proof that you do not have to buy expensive crib bedding sets to create a lovely nursery. I also bought other Snoopy accessories for the room."
4,Snoopy champ was wonderful,Snoopy champ was wonderful and my kid loves it.I truly recommend this to all new moms -you will love it as i do.
5,Bedtime Originals Champ Snoopy Baby Crib bedding set,The 4-piece Baby Crib Bedding Set was just what the mother-to-be wanted for her baby on the way! The colors are vibrant and the entire set was very good quality.
4,If you like Black & White,"I shoot almost exclusively B&W film. I find the contrast characteristics of Tri-X to be the best. The T-Max films are way too flat and lifeless. Tri-X captures a wide tonal range, with excellent sharpness, and little grain. The negatives are great for scanning, and manipulating in Photo Shop. I can blow the scans up to 11 x 17 without loss of detail, and excellent prints. All in all my favorite B&W film."
4,quite a pleasure to own,an exquisite melange of visual treats. good coffee table book or weapon for late night house burglary attempts. includes text from men you don't know and photos of buttocks of men you may.perhaps could have done well to include a touch more of photos of tattoos.
3,not bad,"i expected more from this one, but over all it's not so bad, another book about horiyoshi III"
2,Beyond Dull,"Normally, I'm a fan of this guy, but this program is so visually dull, and some of the expert interviewees so dry, I couldn't recommend this video."
1,Avoid NOF 5.0,"The 5.0 release has a lot of great new features available to create an awesome site, however because of the numerous bugs & errors, which according to NOF will not be corrected for at least 90 days, most of the new features are unusable. If possible, you are better off sticking to Ver. 4.0 or waiting until NOF releases the ""fixes"" for all of the bugs."
3,Too complicated,"This program is more complicated that it needs to be. I'm very familiar with graphics programs and this one isn't great at all. There are so many features that I'd never use. If you want to simplify things, use FrontPage but not this program"
2,Look elsewhere for useful lighting techniques,"This book should be titled Lighting for Luxury Homes. It would be diffficult to translate the ideas presented here into lighting technques the average reader would find useful. Although the cover looks modern, the interior decoration style represented in most of the pictures is a combination of Traditional and Classic. The photos are nice, but not particularly inspiring. Storey's other book titled Lighting is more informative than this one. I don't think this would even make a good coffee table book."
3,Quick and easy service-not a great book,The book arrived unbelievably fast it was just not exactly what I was looking for. I want details; not just pictures and ideas.
4,Story of A Guy Who Went to Iran,"One of my favorite things about this book is that you can see that Dan loves the Iranian people. Dan is just a guy who went to a different country, with his own human foibles, but a special love for his Muslim friends. Even though Dan was imprisoned in Iran, the Muslim people are portrayed compassionately. One thing connected to this, is a small insight into the hidden supernatural realm and how it negatively affects one of the prison guards from his usual demeanor."
