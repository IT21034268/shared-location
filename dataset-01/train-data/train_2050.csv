2,Andis Hair Dryer,"I would say it's a good hair dryer and is quieter than regular hair dryers. The description is misleading where it says 3 speeds and four temperature settings. It only has one control, so low speed is low heat, medium seed is medium heat, and high speed is high heat. There is no way to have high speed and low heat, so it really only has three settings and a cold shot button. I would not have ordered it if that had been clearly stated in the description. The LCD display does not work, and sometimes the dryer cuts off like it has a short in it. If I had bought it locally, I would have returned it, but it took me two weeks to get it, and I don't have another dryer to use, so I will keep it, but I will buy a different one that really has more than three settings."
5,Snaped right on my TrailBlazer,"It is quit nice Hitch cover, very heavy and looks tuff. I think it will last for a long time. But you do have to get a lock for it; which I did, other wise it will not lock in place by itself."
2,RN,"Not user friendly, however I saw the rating before I purchased so I had an preview. I have to agree still that the book is not user frienly."
1,Essentials of Nursing Research,Contacted seller to return the item because it was the wrong edition and recieved no response.
2,Disappointing...,"I am a big fan of Kathleen Krull. She has written so many wonderful books, but LEONARDO DA VINCI is a book that I do not feel comfortable recommending or sharing.In addition to focusing on some issues which might be controversial to introduce to a younger audience, the book lacks end notes or source notes to validate the material in the book. Although Krull is always using quotes, she never tells specifically where she is getting her information. A long bibliography is essentially useless for doublechecking facts since I have no intention of reading twenty books (two specifically speculating on Leonardo's sex life) to find out where she learned that Leonardo hated having dirty fingernails, for example."
1,interminable,"on and on complaints about orientals taking over the world, oily jews and Italians. Muslims murdering for a pair of slippers even if the person involved is innocent of wrongdoing.Fortunately we have the extremely superior Englishman to save us."
3,Fushia not Red,"I know the description of this product is called ""Raspberry Red"", but for some reason I thought it would have at least some true red hue to it. I was going to use this sugar to sprinkle over a large fire truck cake I plan to make for my child, but after receiving it I knew immediately I could not use it since it is a much more true pinkish purple or fushia than red.That being said, I am still happy to find an all natural product with no artifical colors for cake decorating at a great clearance price. I look forward to finding some occasions that I can make fushia colored goodies for."
4,Appears to work!,"The only downfall to this product is that fact that they're pills, and my cat requires four pills each treatment. These pills must taste bad, because my cat WON'T eat them whole, or crushed, in his food. Fortunately, he doesn't resist to sticking them down his throat. If your cat is well enough behaved to do that, then great! Otherwise, I'd go with a liquid de-wormer instead."
1,Not Worth the Money,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas and we are both very disappointed. The planets don't easily suspend and instead readily snap magnetically to the top, and it makes an annoying humming sound. I wouldn't mind how poorly it's made except that it's pricey --- the value is simply not there for the expense."
2,ITEM WAS NOT NEW,THIS ITEM WAS LISTED AS NEW BUT HAS BEEN USED QUITE A BIT. THE BOX WAS ALL CUT UP AND ISN'T REALLY PRESENTABLE. WE BOUGHT IT AS A GIFT BUT IT LOOKS PRETTY TATTERED. FALSELY PRESENTED AS NEW. I NEVER WOULD HAVE PAID THAT PRICE FOR IT IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WAS USED. I COULD HAVE BOUGHT A NEW ONE FOR THE SAME PRICE ! NOT REAL HAPPY!
1,Super stupid!!!,"Started off ok,Then its like whats the point, then your checking stream to see if it accidently turned to a movie on the syfy channel!! The ending reminded 80's horror flick. Just Sorry!!!"
2,Book descripton is not accurate!,"Amazon advertises this book as ""hardcover"" - but ships paper backs!It is very difficult to get any action taken on mis-advertised books.It would be extremely helpfull if Amazon had an 800 number where we could talk to a real person when the order is filled incorrectly or is listed incorrectly on the web site."
4,Bringer of Storms,"My order went to Sandra's shop and she responded quickly. I really wanted to get this late Christmas gift to join books #1 and 3, so the granddaughters could read them in number order. In less than a week it was there and these three girls are delighted as they begin this series. I will work with her again if her shop comes up for an item I may want.Thanks, Marty"
4,A great sequel!!,I enjoyed this sequel to Beyond the Summerland. I think that the idea for a giant who controls the weather is pretty cool.
5,L.B. strikes gold again!,"Bringer of Storms continues L.B. Graham's wonderful story with a brisk, exciting pace! The pages kept turning as the darkness of the storm began to spread. Just as the ending of Beyond the Summerland left me eager to continue the story, Bringer of Storms has left me excited and inspired! Mr. Graham has put so much into these books. Again, I was refreshed and intrigued by his storyline!"
5,"Can't put it down, great summer read!","My family hates when I read a book like this--no meals are made...the clutter builds up--so I did a marathon read of this second book in the series and truly enjoyed the characters and the story. There are strong action sequences plus real depth of character development. This book will appeal to both male and female readers who enjoy fantasy, including those who love Tolkien.Not all fantasy novels are foul language free. This one is. The love relationships spare us graphic details, too. There is violence (it is about a war, after all) with some details, but not to the point of gratuitous violence.The best thing is that there is richness, depth, to the story. You not only care about the characters and the outcome of the story, but the book goes deeper than that--to the heart. I can't wait until my next weekend OFF, so that I can read the next book in the series"
2,Disappointing,I read -- and reread -- the pocket zen book by the same editor. It was infinitely better than this book. I find a majority of the teachings in this book uninspiring and feel that they would not turn a new person on to zen.
3,"Good Product, fast delivery",Good- Item was received quickly (2 days) without problems and worked as expected.- I can transfer some items between telephone and computerBad- process is slow. I think I am just going to get a micro SD card so I can transfer pictures easily and not worry about other possible items I might be able to do.
4,there but ....,"Honour, once lost, can never be regained, only recollected .... Yes, there but for the grace of God go I.This 6th book in the series remains my favourite, after all these years, as it is the pivot on which the whole series turned. Or would have if John Norman had not lost his way in the detail of Gor's wonderful and fantastic backdrop. But I digress, them great invincible warrior, falls from grace and redisovers his humanity. And a new strength is born in him as he understands his own weakness, and theose of his enemies and allies."
4,The absolute BEST one so far...,"I've now read the first six books straight through without pause or break. By far, this is the best of the first six. The action never stops and I love the self-loathing Bosk goes through. I really hope the next books stick to this same forumula. For the first time, there wasn't a single chapter that irritated me."
5,Tarl's adventures continue,Tables are turned when Tarl is captured. He learns what it is like from the other side. Will he be freed? You have to read it to find out.
2,pages are not in order,"the book was in good condition, but as I read it the pages were misplaced, that was not on the description it went from page 169 to 175, then from there more pages were misplaced."
3,Raiders of Gor,"I have been reading the series in order and enjoyed this book. I was surprised at the change in character of Tarl Cabot and wonder what it means for his part in the remaining books. For a fan of the books it is a good read. Predictable at times, but more of Gor can be learned from the book and the readers's study of the continuing development of Tarl's character is enjoyable.I recommend it for followers of the books."
4,The Groups Biggest Hit,"Cleveland, OH's, Rude Boys racked up their biggest hit, ""Written All over Your Face"" in 1991 (no. 16 pop). The number has a Philly Soul groove (reminiscent to the O'Jays' ""Use Ta Be My Girl"") and seductive vocal harmonies. Like most late-'80s and early-'90s R&B, the track is set to a modified hip-hop beat, but the quartet's delivery nearly outshines the bouncy groove. Banks and Little convey an emotional testimony. Nothing else the foursome touched entered Billboard's pop 100, let alone the Top 40. The now-defunct quartet is billed as one of New Jack's finest one-hit wonder bands, but the entire group seemed too good for their own careers."
5,Great combination of Vaughan Williams,"This disk makes a splendid introduction to Vaughan Williams.The symphony is more concise than many of his other sypmhonies, so those new to VW can develop their patience slowly. And the accompanying works are probably worth the price of the disk by themselves. I need not say much about the Tuba Concerto, as others have ""trumpeted"" its merits here already. But my favorite pieces here are the Elizabethan Portraits. Like the symphony, they are concise, short, and very exciting!.The symphony is well done, like the rest of Previn's cycle. I prefer Vernon Handley's recording for the symphony, but the Previn is more than acceptable.Few combinations as diverse and satisfying like this exist. Grab it!The disk is also now available in a boxed set, Amazon ASIN # B00011MK74, for a phenomenal price."
1,Know What You're Ordering,"Unlike other reviewers, I was really disappointed in this book. Because of the cover picture, I was expecting another book similar to Quilt National or Quilt Visions, but it's not like that at all. There are only a couple of quilts in the book similar to the cover quilt. The rest are variations on traditional quilts--very nice but not my cup of tea. The dialogue on each quilt was interesting, but I'd suggest taking a peek at this book in person to be sure you want to order it for your collection."
5,It's a funnel. It works.,"What can I say? I have no idea why anyone would complain about this funnel. It gets liquid from point a to point b; no spills, no problems. I used this funnel to pour Seafoam additive into my gas tank and had no problems and it wasn't too awkward even with the weird angle.Not much liquid fits into the funnel so you must pour slowly to moderately. Really, is that an issue? This world is full of crybabies. You want more fluid to fit? Then buy an expensive funnel. Anyway, for normal people, this works, it's cheap, and it also ships out at record speed."
3,Short Stem,"Dont go by the picture. The stem looks long and slender whenin fact its pretty fat (1/2"")at the tip and only 5"" long. I purchased 2of them and their useless for my needs. Too cheap to send back. Bad move!"
4,Funnel,"It does the job, use it for a hard to reach transmission fluid fill pipe. You may want one with a flexible pipe for really hard to reach spots"
5,Very handy,Shipping a little expensive....small funnel that comes in useful when filling gas tanks with small openings. Also for hard to get to vehicle gas tanks and or oil reservoirs.
3,Small funnel...,The dimensions of this funnel (length) should be in the description. It works well to some extent for putting gas into the filler tube on a vehicle...but since the top is so small you would need to pour very slowly to get much gas in. Probably not worth $4.
5,Great affordable funnel!,"Works great in refilling oil in my generator and lawnmower!It even has a lip on the top so the oil won't go out of the funnel.The only problem with funnels is, you never know how full the chamber is,and always need to remove the funnel to look. Someone should invent a meter on the funnel, that helps in overflowing,and an end valve in case the chamber is full, to prevent it from overflowing.But until then, this funnel will do just fine!"
4,It's a funnel. It works.,"Gee, I like the color and it's a funnel. It works just as advertised and it showed up four days before the produce got here."
4,Smaller than I thought...should have been cheaper,It is what it is. It will work well for oil since it is a lot smaller than I expected. I've seen what looked like these in the auto parts store that were a couple of feet long. I had to laugh when I pulled this tiny thing out of the box.Nothing wrong with the product though. I should have considered the dimensions and the price I was paying for it.
5,nice,Great small funnel it is also less than if you go to an auto parts store. very good deal to buy
1,tiny cheap plastic,a lot smaller than it looks cheaply made only good for very small jobs a a a a aa a
4,Okay,It's an okay product. It came in the mail very quickly. I would recommend this item specially for the price.
3,A product to have in your garage.,"This is a product to have on your garage. The price is a little high, but is something to have."
5,Manages pouring nicely,"Got this to put oil in my ATV and generator. These devices have tiny oil fills impossible to fill from bottles or cans, This makes all the difference. Drip free is sooo nice."
3,OK,"It arrived as promised looks like the picture. But, I must not have read well because it is smaller than I hoped. Hence just the three stars."
2,Incredibly dated,"At best this is a fairly dry course book. At worst (see Chapter 12), it is overwhelmingly dated. Several pages are dedicated to describing what a search engine is, among other basic online tools (such as a library database and research database). For a book published in 2009, that's pretty sad. For a course book it could be much worse, I'm sure, but for anything other than required reading I would recommend looking elsewhere."
1,In the Company of Others: An Introduction to Communication,"Personally I think the class is a waste of time, but overall the book is even more worthless. Apparently I don't understand other humans because this book is telling me a bunch of ""facts"" based on opinions. Personally I think the book is a bunch of bull**** and I have yet to even bring it to my class. My teacher said the book would be required and I have yet to bring it and still have an A, so obviously it isn't required.I give this book a -1 because I am now more stupid for having bought this book and obtaining worthless information."
4,Lots of pretty pictures,"Admittedly, this book is a fun coffee-table read. I think that is all it aims to be.I found the scholarship hard to reference (I would have liked to have seen an impressive bibliography and had trouble sourcing both images and facts) but just thumbing through the book and looking at the clothing is sheer eye candy.Too much of contemporary dress is based on conformity, and seeing some designers having fun with textures, colours and history is a treat. The men wearing these designs would need not only sheer guts but a sense of fun, too.That said, this book belongs in the ""for fun"" category, but not on the scholar's bookshelf for the history of men's dress."
3,Witty Decadence,"I picked up a signed copy of this while living in London and was thrilled to finally find a book that addressed exuberance in masculine attire. Since then, I have discovered the extensive exuberance of male costume throughout the World and this book seems less impressive. It covers male clothing from Christian cultures, and is heavily influenced by the anti-luxury and anti-sex stance of Christianity. In other words, much of the clothing in this book comes across as naughty and scandalous rather than fun and life-affirming. There are some interesting pictures, but the overall feeling is one of cynicism."
1,Depressing and Utterly Pointless,"Although most one-star reviews are written by those who have not read the book, this is unfortunately not the case with me. I felt compelled to finish this one based on the five dollars that I spent, but it would have been wiser had I just forgotten about the wasted money and gotten drunk instead. This may be the worst story ever written. It has no plot or redeeming value and was apparantly written simply for the purpose of depressing the unlucky readers who might stumble on it.Rape, child molestation, and graphic homosexuality run rampant throughout the book. Every character is an amoralist (as is the author, most likely) so there's no one to sympathize with. All of humanity is dead by the end of the book anyway, and by that time I found myself wishing that I could join them."
4,Very well done - Reflections of Christ,I saw this played in a very small segment on TV - during a LDS conference. I purchased it and was amazed at the making of this DVD. To see the process that they went through - the actors - the equipment and photography setup - was just plain great. Then to see the finished product - and the beautiful scenes that were produced - was well worth the price paid. Reflections of Christ - has no background to tie you into any religion - but if you believe in GOD - you will find this DVD well worth your spending a few minutes - watching - to reflect on the Glory of a truly great personage.
2,Disappointing as a gift candidate,"I'm sure that the photographs are excellent. However, in this DVD, the slide show of the photographs is given secondary priority, very little time is allowed for viewing each photo, and it's impossible to discern the detail in most of them. The main feature of the DVD isn't the pictures themselves -- it's all about the production of the pictures -- very interesting in itself, but hardly what I expected, and certainly not the kind of material I would send as a Christmas gift. I had hoped I might be able to send this DVD to a lot of friends and family, but instead I'm returning it to Amazon."
5,Scott Hahn at his best!,Scott Hahn takes you through the ABC's of the confessional from the history of this ancient sacrament to an examination of conscience. This is must have for any serious Catholic library
1,Dr. Hahn Devotee Expected More,"Having been duly impressed with 8 or 10 previous offerings from Dr. Hahn I had admittedly very high expectations, perhaps unfairly so. I would rank this lower than any of my previous exposures to this truly gifted gentleman.Don't misunderstand. If for no other reasons than his preeminent biblical knowledge & lengthy writing experience this is worthwhile.I have just learned to expect more."
1,too basic,"i'm not catholic, but i think there's sthg to confession, so i bought this book to see if there was. i wasn't convinced. i mean, i still believe we should ""confess our sins to one another"", but i don't see how this can't be accomplished just as well w/ an accountability partner/group."
1,Shallow and trite,"I was disappointed. I had expected a deeper thoughtful exposition on the benefits and blessings of confession. Dr. Hahn toes the party line and does not present anything original. Where is the healing power of confession? I believe there is but you won't find it in this book.I guess I was wrong about this book. This book is for people in our culture who need to be entertained and cuttled back into a vital and necessary part of religious life. This book is for those who need milk but I would like to find a book with more meat. I'm thinking in the class of a Merton, Nouwen, Ruth Burrows, Peter van Breemen.Scott, please write a book which I can really bite into and find nourishment for my soul."
5,ANOTHER SUPERB BOOK BY MR. HAHN...,"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK ON THE IMPORTANCEOF CONFESSION.ONCE AGAIN SCOTT HAHN HAS WRITTEN A FINE SCHOLARLYWORK.THE FIRST BOOK OF HIS WAS ""ROME SWEET,HOME"".THAT ALSO WAS EXCELLENT,AS A MATTER OF FACTIT HELPED ME CONVERT FROM AN EVANGICAL TOA CATHOLIC CHRISTIAN!FOR ALL CATHOLICS TO READ AND PONDER.ALSO YOU PROTESTANT TOO!DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND READ THIS BOOK!"
2,Lacking documentation for scan to SMTP email,"Yes the scanner is nice. Yes it scans to a file. Yes it scans to your Microsoft email client (i.e. Outlook) and the document attaches fine. But that's not what I need. The scanner is supposed to have the ability to set up 50 ""one touch"" jobs that scan directly to email without going through the client app. I cannot get this to work to save my life. There are only a few options to set up and looks to be easy, but it just won't work. The scanner will display worthless error messages such as ""send failed"". The documentation gives ZERO support in this area and nothing at this moment exists on the web for solving issues. Some error codes and a list of trouble shooting them in the manual would go along way in trying to resolve this issue. You don't know if it is a host issue, a mail server issue, an authentication issue, etc. The documentation flat out stinks."
4,A Bit Disappointed,I bought this for my wife based on reviews that I have seen stating the ease of use and quality output. I agree with the ease of use but the quality was not there in doing color scans. Her older scanner was an HP ScanJet 7400C and it produced better color head to head against the Canon. Scanning directly to a Canon I9100 Printer the HP reproduced the colors more accurately than the Canon DR1210C. I was disappointed and could not justify the cost of the Canon. I returned the Canon.
1,It's going to expire!,"It says that this item should sell by july 11, it's something going to be expire. It's a behavior of cheating i think."
5,Profoundly important and a good read to boot.,"Susan Moeller gets right to the heart of the weaknesses of how the American media covers foreign news and the way the American audience percieves it. But she doesn't just paint a picture of the problems -she spells out some constructive and doable means to fix them. As a journalist myself, I recommended this book to all of my peers -both in the industry and out of it."
1,Dull.,This should have been a booklet not book.Very little info here.Its more about etiquette and even then its brief.Dull.
1,this book is a joke,"It claims to be 112 pages, but there is only solid text between pages 11 and 44. Of those 33 pages, nearly half are blank or have only a fuzzy black and white photograph that may or may not be 25 years old. On pages with print, they are wide margined, typically with three paragraphs, each made up of three sentences. I didn't bother to count, but I'll bet there are fewer than 200 sentences in the whole 'book'. Let's call it a booklet. And there is nothing insightful about the observations it contains. It's a lazy a knock off of another book by a similar title, which has dense advice in excess of 200 pages. Don't waste your money on this book. Mine is going back to Amazon."
5,Sky Golf Holster,"I also purchased this for my husband. Now he doesn't have to worry about scratches or cleaning it all the time. The only thing that was desappointing was in order to use his golf mount, he had to remove the protective cover or it wouldn't fit. Slight pain but he still likes and uses it."
2,O.K. for a couple of uses only,"Bought 2 of these tarps to cover mulch piles while spreading, and cover shrubs to protect from frost.They are inexpensive and remember the old adage ""You get what you pay for."" One use covering a mulch pile and I had several tears in one of them already.Also, don't depend on them to be impervious to water, they are NOT.If you have a need for protecting your roof in case of tree limb damage, or other ""must protect"" spend a little more and get a better tarp."
5,right price and good quality,"The price is right and the quality is good, even it's thiner and light, but it's even hold rain water. It's more than expected."
1,too thin,tarp was too thin . i bought this to cover some chairs for the winter but instead i had to fold it 4x to use to make it usable. I will not recommend this product at all.
3,"Good tarp, but not meant for heavy duty usage.","This tarp, for the price is a good deal. I've used it several times, mostly to put down on the ground or as a cover. The thickness is good. But once while hiking, I used it to create a make shift roof and strung it up by the corners. The corner holes started to tear pretty quickly. That was disappointing.So, if you need a simple tarp to use for ground cover or a basic cover, this is good stuff. If you need something a little more heavy duty, you might want to skip this one."
4,Good Comeback Album,"Cyclorama is an album released by Styx in 2003 and it is the first studio not to include founding member Dennis DeYoung. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it really is. I was told by one of my cousins to get Cyclorama but was skeptical because I wasn't sure they could come up with something good without DeYoung. Goes to show you how wrong I was. This album rocks fueled by songs like ""Do Things My Way"", Yes I Can"" and ""One With Everything"" to name a few of the highlights. One thing that is true is that Cyclorama is a more democratic and team approach than their previous album ""Brave New World. Shaw, JY, and Glen Burtnik came up with good material with a few contributions from then new member Lawrence Gowan."
4,One of the better DVD audio discs I've heard,"I don't have too many DVD-A's (maybe 10) so I'm no expert. But I'm a sound/music guy and know what I hear. First I used to love Styx when I was a kid. Haven't given them much though for 20 years really. So... my report:Sound quality is very good compared to a others I've heard. Styx is kind of weird music generally - dramatic scores and things. But I still like it. This is different than the old Styx and has some really cool stuff - not super poppy but has some catchy tunes and generally solid songwriting.Besides Gaucho, my favorite DVD-A so far. My 16 year old girl likes it a lot, to my surprise. She really likes the carrot theme too... thinks it's funny. You'll see what I mean if you buy it.PS - one of the best Dolby 5.1 experiences is the soundtrack from Team America - World Police. It's funny, beautifully engineered etc. The movie rocks too - funny but definitely rated 'R+' and NOT P.C."
3,"Styx sound, tinny production values...","This is a good disc song-wise. Classic sounding Styx with Gowan taking over keyboard duties from departed member Dennis DeYoung. I just find it to be quite bright, almost peircing in the top end."
3,Dubious sound quality in places,"Sometimes my inner cheapskate takes over! And Amazon wakes him up more reliably than most buying situations. I had borrowed the Atlanta Symphony version of this from the local library and liked it a lot. But on Amazon, Atlanta's DDD version it is almost twice the price of the LSO's ADD version. Amazon lists a date of October 1990, so sound quality shouldn't be too bad? Well from the disk itself it seems the recording was made in 1970. Big difference in recording technology!The piece starts with a huge crescendo. Not only does the LSO version sound heavily compressed, it also sounds quite distorted. This only lasts a few seconds, but by then the magic is gone and I'm reminded how easily I am swayed by my inner cheapskate!To be fair, the on the other 98% of the disk the sound quality is very acceptable if not quite stellar."
5,great album,"just got htis cd a few days ago and i must say that i am very positively surprised. you still can hear the influences from the typical ""Vienna Style"" but with a much more jazzier and funkier attitude than lots of other stuff coming from this city.when i read that patrick pulsinger is the producer of this masterpiece, everything was clear for me.so get it and listen to it as often as possible!looking forward to hear the remixes coming out."
2,Disappointing! Buy the Rough Guide instead.,"After using the Thailand Lonely Planet guide (also written by Joe Cummings) extensively this summer (it was extremely helpful), I found the Laos guide really disappointing.Laos is changing at an alarming rate and a lot of the information in this guide was out of date. Also, unlike the Thailand guide which is quite detailed, I found this book to be kind of skimpy. The maps aren't very good, a lot of towns weren't included, transportation details were no longer correct or not included, and because of the surge in tourism and high inflation rate, the prices listed were meaningless.Until edition 4 of the Laos Lonely Planet guide is published, I would recommend buying The Rough Guide Laos which was published in January 2000 and was getting good reviews from other tourists."
2,"Guide to nonexistent restaurants, old residences, old hotels","The problem with this guide is that, even though things have changed since the last revision, the guidebook hasn't.I would strongly recommend the Rough Guide and a curious spirit over the Lonely Planet guide to Laos, even the new 4th edition. Either way you're going to contend with some bad information, but at least with the Rough guide you won't have to put up with Cummings' writing. I'm sure he's a brilliant scholar, but there are other reasons people go on vacation besides research.Don't miss Luangphabang and the villages up and down the Mekong, whatever you do. Beyond that, everything in Laos is hit-and-miss. Relax and enjoy it. I've never had so much fun on a vacation in my entire life, and it was cheap as dirt, too."
2,Great for the cities and history,"If you are doing the regular two week route of Luang Phrabang - Vang Vieng - Vientiane, this is an outstanding book, despite the inevitable dating of hotel and restaurant info. You have got to expect this considering how much stuff is written about these three places and Laos in general, leaving only a third of the book to cover the other 99% of the country.The only really useful bits were the map and suggested itineraries where the authors actually offered their opinions.Generally the ""around the area"" sections are far less useful than anyone you would meet in the street of the town because of the emphasis on describing restaurants and hotels. As if anyone would have difficulty in finding the only restaurant or guesthouse in a one street village.Buying a map and talking to other travellers was far better, more fun, and cheaper than the LP."
2,Not a full update--Hua Phan Province info VERY out of day,"I bought this edition for a bicycle trip across northern Laos, but was very disappointed with the very old and inaccurate information on Hua Phan Province in the northeast of the country. It's a remote region, and probably on few travelers' itineraries, but it was on mine. I felt let down that the authors didn't provide up-to-date coverage. Neither author even visited the province! That's not good enough."
3,Wait for the 4th Edition,"Tourism in Laos is expanding rapidly. The LP 4th Edition should be in the works by now. Buy it. This, the 3rd Edition is now pretty badly out of date. Though, compared to other guidebooks, it's still the best around."
2,Handy,"This guide is a little bit dated now but is still very useful for the maps and some easy tips on what you might expect in certain places.Things are changing so quickly in Laos and I dare say it is not for the best, please travel as gently as possible. Talking louder will not help."
1,dangers and annoyances- this book,"I'm sorry, but did the author even go to Laos before writing this book? Don't get me wrong- Joe Cummings does an excellent job in his Thailand books, however, in Laos, he falls short. The descriptions are incorrect (and sure, things change but not that much) and the maps are totally off. Skip the bike routes (eg. the one to Buddha Park) in Vientiane, especially after the rainy season."
5,Love it!,"I purchased a used version for 1.29, so it did not come with the supplies. This book has a lot of information about how to prepare the skin, how to mix different ingredients for different effects, detailed step-by-step designs, with explanations of how and why for everything. It breaks things down to simplicity, without losing any important iformation.Don't worry, this is not one of those books that takes up too much time and space with fairytales, myths, or pictures. The book includes all of these in a way that will help you instead of just being added to make the book thicker. You're going to learn from this book."
3,"Jeff Beck Group 's ""Beck Ola""","This a superb remaster of the original LP. Noisy an raucous, maybe the first ""heavy metal"" LP ever recorded.Got this CD specially for the bonus selections, far superior to the original tracks.But for the Beck fans, for completion sake."
4,Why Not ?,"This is an album you've probably been waiting to purchase forever. Don't hesitate, it is as good as advertised. Jeff Back & Rod Stewart together in a matchup that did not last long enough. I saw Jeff Beck in a medium-sized club two years ago : still awesome after all these years."
4,NICE,"He has a different style which I am all for. I was just going thru some music and found him, he definitely on his way to better things. His vocals are very nice and he worships God enough said."
5,A new Devlin fan,"I love all things Devlin! ""In Seville"" is the sexiest song I've ever heard! If you buy the CD just for this song, you won't be disappointed - but there are eleven more songs to listen to and you'll be hard pressed to pick your favorite - they're all great! ""Wide Open"", ""Static in the Flow"" and ""Snowbirds"" - oh, please, just buy it!!! You've got to hear it! <>g<>"
2,"Cuts fine, but has two pill compartments instead of one as pictured","I searched the web for a pill cutter that had only one pill compartment (front part), and ordered this. I was disappoionted because it has two compartments and it is hard to get the pills out if you have more than one in the comparment."
3,Danger Diabolik,"Italian director Mario Bava, better known for his horror films, seems to be playing off the whole spy spoof genre, only this time he adds a little twist. The ""hero"" of this film isn't trying to save the world; rather, he's a thief and killer dreaded by the world. He isn't fighting for the government, but against it. John Philip Law plays Diabolik, a criminal out to steal billions from the government, swingin' sixties style! And with the help of his steamy, wig-wearing girlfriend, no one will get in his way, not even the innocent. Check out Diabolik's hip underground pad and his huge bed of money. WOW! This movie is more appreciated by the senses than anything. The fab sixties decor will make your eyes light up and the swinging soundtrack will make your ears ring with delight! So if your interested in some eye and ear candy, rent this. But if you want something with a meaningful script that will get your mind fired, keep looking."
5,"The definitive ""Easy-listening"" movie.","If you like Burt Bacharach, Ennio Morricone, if you loved Barbarella, Harry Palmer, etc... You can't ignore ""Danger : Diabolik"". I've been looking for this movie in Europe for 18 months, and finally ordered it form the USA. And this is the most stylish film I've ever seen. Poor scenario (but this is definitely enjoyable) with an amazing atmosphere. E-Type Jaguars, secret underground bases, mind-blowing music : this is how the world should be."
5,Why would Paramount let this go out of print?,"Don't understand Paramonut,they put out a nice edition of Danger Diabolik and let it go out of print,I was lucky enough to find a brand new copy at a Piggly Wiggly of all places when I was visiting South Carolina for only 7.99 + tax,this is after it went out of print so I feel so lucky,the quality of the Widescreen print is superb on this DVD,it also has some interesting extras as well,hopefully it will go back in circulation,one can hope,I'm so glad to ahve this in DVD as is my VHS got eaten(Oh ther horror!) FYI,this movies is based on Europe's Dibolik comics!!! A+"
2,They've got to be kidding?,"I also saw this on Mystery Science Theater 3000. It can't be taken seriously, I mean stuck to the ceiling in gold...wink...wink? As a commedy it's not bad, but as a serious action film it's lacking. Now I see what Austin Powers was parodying."
5,Johanna Lindsey is one of the best writers of Romance,Johanna Lindsey has done it again and again... another set of wonderful stories to keep you on the edge of your seat.. it is so great to have these stories on CD for people who are driving a lot or who can't read anymore. They take you to far away places in jolly old England and through out Europe with plot twists and a bit of history all rolled up together. Johanna Lindsey continues to be one of my favorite authors that stand the test of time.
5,Wonderful Pro-Life Cartoon,"This is a wonderful cartoon book for children. It is gleaned from the illustrator's weekly cartoon strips which appear in the National Catholic Register. I gave it to my then-five-year-old son for Christmas and he was overjoyed.I would caution parents that the pro-life message is strong in this book, and I recommend previewing it for appropriateness for your own children."
1,The unfunniness of Marmaduke PLUS the sanctimoniousness of pro-lifers!,"As if the world needed more inaccurate representations of fetal sentience, we bring you the puerile world of Umbert the Unborn! The perfect gift for someone you hate."
1,Ridiculous Pro-Life Fantasizing About Fetuses,"I heard about this comic from a Catholic friend, found the book, and took a look. It's a fast read, and I suppose if you're looking for the pro-life fantasy of what it must be like for a fetus, this book will serve you well. But personally, I'm looking forward to ""The Adventures of Ella the Egg & Sam the Sperm."""
4,20th Century,"What a great book , full of history, movie reviews and beautiful pictures. I enjoyed comparing each year's pictures with those from the other movie studios. Great buy, and great addition to any movie studion collection."
2,soft materials only,This is not a usable tool except on wood or plastic. The steel is so soft it will not ream even the very mildest iron. Learned my lesson not to try to be so cheap.
5,taper reamer - great little gadget,"Bought this for my husband. He is a piper, that is a bagpiper, and he wanted this to ream out something on the pipes. He said it worked just as he needed and that it was a great little gadget.His mission accomplished and he was happy with the reamer."
4,Back Home,"This seemed to be a lovely book. I purchased as a gift, and looked through it reading a few passages. It is for one who has moved away and I think she will relate to some of the sentiments expressed, as well as have endearing memories rekindled. At least that's my goal."
4,"Great book, Hiragana section was great; Katakana, lacking","I bought this book after reading all of the great reviews on the site, and I want to say that it did deliver on it's claim. I was able to learn the Hiragana in less than 3 hours. At first it was quite akward, but once you get used to Heisig's methods it comes naturally and effortlessly.After I ""mastered"" the Hiragana, I was eager to commence my study of the Katakana but was greatly disappointed on this section. I'm not sure why Heisig chose to nearly abandon the method he used in the previous Hiragana section, possibly because he had collaborators on this part of the book.This is definitely worth the small price tag, but you will most likely want to supplement it with another book to solidify your knowledge of the Katakana and also to better explain the dipthongs and plosives. I got the Kana workbook of the Japanese For Busy People Series but haven't ventured far enough into it to give it a proper review. Hope this was helpful."
3,Needs Improvement...,"The first/Hiragana half of the book was quite good. Looks of fun mnemonic devices for memorizing, handy tips on the pacing, very intuitive after a while.BUT the Katakana half is a poorly slapped together effort. They give almost virtually no tips on memorizing the characters! Instead they act as if you have previously memeorized the more complicated kanji first! Why they choose to abandon the approach that seemed to work so well in the hiragana half is a real mystery to me.This book helped me learn Hirigana but has left me looking for another book to learn Katakana. So, i can only give this book 3 stars. I hope the next edition fixes these major flaws."
2,Kana Flashcards superior,"Put simply, the mnemonics is this book were far inferior to those in White Rabbit Press's kana flashcards (link:Kana Flashcards), which offer the additional benefit of being easier to 'flip through' than a book. While the book helpfully divides the syllabaries into digestible lessons with 6-9 characters each, the same thing can be accomplished by simply dividing the flashcards into arbitrary piles. While there is nothing egregiously wrong with the book the flashcards are more effective."
5,Simply amazing.,"This is such a small and inexpensive book, but the knowledge inside is worth ten times the price. The method for learning the kana is a good one. If one of Heisig's mnemonics doesn't stick with you, simply make up one of your own. Buy a pack of index cards with this book, and as you go through the lessons make a flash card for each kana. Despite the fact that he teaches you the kana out of dictionary order, the kana are printed IN dictionary order and I guarantee when you're done with this book, you'll know the order anyways. To put it simply, this book makes it easy! For such a cheap price you should definetly check it out if you're even remotely interested in learning japanese."
2,Doesn't fit my learning style,"I agree with soreloser's assessment. Heisig tries to help you remember the hiragana by providing mnemonic devices (rhymes and visual images). They are hit and miss IMO. I tired of Heisig's method pretty quickly; it became as much work to remember Heisig's mnemonic devices as it was simply to buckle down and memorize the hiragana. His images began to feel like clutter in my brain. I got a copy of ""Let's Learn Hiragana"" by Yasuko K. Hiragana at the local library and find it much more suitable to my learning style."
4,ever so easy,"Remembering the Hiragana deserves 5 stars *****. I was amazed with how easy it was.Remembering the Katakana is not quite that good. It is still a great way to learn the Katakana, but is not quite as well laid out as the hiragana section(the drills should have the kana to the near the inside margin. The even numbered pages are laid out incorrectly.But, I still highly recommend this book. I don't feel there is ""any"" better way to learn. You'll be so proud when you are done!"
2,Did not work for me at all....,"I bought this book based on all the positive reviews here on Amazon.com. Well, all I can say is that it didn't work for me at all. Not only was I frustrated by the constant flipping of pages and the weird way the author expects you to remember something but also, even though every letter has some examples of its us at the bottom, there is no translation for them at all. So you are reading something like ""atsui"" but you have no idea what the heck that means.Overall, Im quite disappointed and will not buy any of the other books by this author."
1,Remembering to buy another book to learn Japanese,"This book has a ""creative"" (if not downright silly) approach, there is no doubt. However, I wouldn't advise using Heisig's back-of-the-napkin approach. Far too dated (this book came out in 1978), far too gimmick-y.You are better off buy something from Hiroko Storm, Michael Rowley or Peter X. Takahashi. This way, you know you are at least learning Japanese in a really Japanese way..."
3,"Decent value, odd methodolgy","I give this 3 stars begrudingly because the book is cheap. I'm using the book, but have given up on the utterly bizarre and tangential metaphors that the author utilizes to spur memory association with each character. It has led me to just grind out each set of kana in alphabetical order and to use the book as a set of flash cards to test myself and to reference the different type sets in common use in Japan (very useful!)."
4,Worked for me.,"I'm not a fan at all of the kanji books by this author, but the kana book is excellent, if a little silly. The claim of learning each set of characters in three hours is mostly true - I wouldn't (and the author recommends against) sitting down and trying to cram it all in my skull in one marathon three hour session; and I admit I had to refer back to it on occasion, but overall it saved me many many hours of quality time with the flashcards. Or at least, let me spend more hours tearing my hair out over the kanji instead. The only negative thing I have to say about this book is that even now, years later, I still sometimes look at a one of the kana and think something like ""Ok, that looks like a womans arm, so that's an ""Ah"" sound."" I know I shouldn't be embarrassed about not having learned by kana by brute force memorization, but somehow I am."
3,Could be better,"Pot alone is great. Not in love with: 1) the way the lid fits; and 2) the handle. I expected the lid to tightly inside a lip of the pot; it did not. The wire handle sort of ""sticks"" in certain positions ... doesn't move smoothly at times. I haven't actually used the pot yet. Despite the complaints about the lid and the handle, I'm sure, though, that the overall piece will be sufficient; but some slight design improvements could turn this from a B- / C+ piece to a solid A."
2,Not suitable for swimming,"Not that this is a bad product; it may be made well (or not, I don't know), but the top and straps do not fit securely for swimming. By ""swimming"" I mean lap swimming, not wading or gentle water aerobics. Because this swimsuit is not appropriate for swimming I would classify this as ""cruise wear,"" yet this product doesn't look as fashionable as most cruise wear. Since it is not suitable for swimming nor as fashionable as cruise wear, it doesn't seem to do anything well.It has been difficult to find a maternity bathing suit that is (a) not just a lounge-chair suit, (b) not black, and (c) provides secure coverage through 9 full months. I found a maternity tankini at another site that mostly fits the bill although the tankini top floats up (also the belly is outgrowing the top at the end of the pregnancy)."
4,Great Brakes .. Slight Installation Annoyance,"The brakes are quite and stop my 2004 Acura MDX well. One complaint is that my original pads (front) had a wear indicator only on the inside pad, and the Akebono pads had them on both the inside and outside pads. The outside pad wear indicator interfered with the caliper bracket. I ended up using some pliers and wiggling the indicator back and forth until it broke off .. no more problems!I also installed Akebono ProACT pads for my rear brakes and on my brothers 2001 Civic, and those pads did not have the dual wear indicator problem."
1,Fell apart in 3 weeks,"The average bedroom slipper that I purchase, whether it be an expensive or a cheap model, will normally last me about a year. Unfortunately, these Reebok slippers fell apart within three weeks of purchase (with an almost complete separation of the sole from the insole). Inspecting them more closely, I found that these slippers are very cheaply and poorly made, with no chance of lasting beyond a very short time. They now reside in my trashcan, instead of on my feet."
5,PREVINs Foundation in Film Scoring Shines Through,I'll have to admit that I was never too enthusiastic of Andre Previn as a film composer. Not until the recent release of his ELMER GANTRY score to compact disc did I actually pay some attention to his music. His orchestrations and conducting on that recording made me start sampling some of his other works as a conductor. I love the music of Ralph Vaughan Williams because for me it has a great cinematic quality about it. With that two-pronged angle of attack I approached this Compact Disc of Williams' Symphonies 7 & 8. It is very good and I think Previn's handling of the work is extremely appealing. It satisfies what I was looking for.
5,Great resource!,I've been looking for a book like this for a long time. It's a great resource for actors! Really has helped me with auditions.
1,"DON'T PAY THIS PRICE, BUY CHEAPER!!!","yes, this is an amazing song, i absolutely love it, but 30 dollars for a cd single! forget that! you can buy this song on the Anastasia Soundtrack! 5 bucks for the whole thing if you buy used! i didn't want to pay that high price, so with my internet searching skills, realized, the darn song is on the soundtrack for that movie! so buy this song, but from the Anastasia Soundtrack!you're welcome :)"
1,ick..... sounds like she's getting sick.,"I can see the Cyndi Lauper type appeal of her voice, but in ""At the Beginning"" what's with all the heavy breathing between bars? She sounds like she is trying to clear out some phlegm or something."
3,Photos are small...,"The trouble with this book is that it is very small and the photos inside are tiny. The text is interesting but I purchased the book for its photography, so I was not very pleased with it. Amazon accepted my return and refunded my money with no questions asked."
2,"Heavy on Imagination, light on music","It should be made clear that this book is more about Beethoven's philosophy, than about his music. There are two chapters devoted entirely to his relationship with Free Masonry, a good few chapters of rather speculative interpretation of the Diabelli Variations, and very little on the late quartets (what little there is remains characteristically speculative.)"
5,A wonderful field flora,"While in the Rockies I found this flora to be indespensible to sating my curiosity of the plants I came across. Its key is designed so that it can be used in the field, giving traits distinguishable by naked eye and hand lens rather than dissecting scope. It's also thorough of its coverage (especially compared to similar-sized flora of other areas, simply because the Colorado vegetation is a little more limited), and it was definately satisfying to be able to carry around so useful a book. (If you're looking for a picture ID guide, however, this isn't it. Like many flora, its drawings in the back are intended to confirm identification rather than as a flip-finder.)"
5,Comprehensive,"Brilliant guide. This is the one I turn to when all others have failed. No photos. Does have a lot of line drawings of species. But if this book is to be of any value to you, you have to learn to read the botanical keys. Best field guide for Colorado flora Eastern Slope though (flora meaning vegetation - you'll find a lot more than wildflowers in this book). Take note that there is a Western Slope version too."
3,"A superb poet, poorly presented--not a good place to start","For those less famililar with O'Hara there is only one place to start: City Lights' superb little pocket collection, ""Lunch Poems.""This collection is enormous, and much of it--especially the early work--is not stylistically representative of his best and most well-known work. It is also dreadfully organized. The poems are not presented by date of publication or date written. Nor do the poems include either date. That information is in a separate index--organized, infuriatingly, by date. So unless you've memorized the year of each of the thousands of poems in this 600 page book, it's not terribly useful. I do hope this book is re-edited substantially for future publication. In the meantime, it will have to do.At his best, Frank O'Hara's poems are wonderfully accessible, sparklingly natural, delightful, and have the ability to delicately carve out a perfectly captured nanosecond of living breathing space and time with insight and sincerity."
1,Awful,I never received this book and I don't know how to get in touch with any other to get my money back.
1,Superficial Analysis,"This book is good if you want to be warned over and over to wash your hands! If you are looking for the difference between viruses and bacteria, actual scientific references or interesting facts about how germs and bacteria live, reproduce and colonize us - look elsewhere. This book was too preachy and didn't have enough information for anyone with a genuine interest in biology, human physiology, or health."
5,"Great, Informative and Fun","Not at all a dry, scientific read. You'll never look at New York city the same after reading this!"
3,The Secret Life of Germs,"As a microbiologist, I found the history of germs and the descriptions of various diseases and their etiologic agents well done. However, Tierno's disease preventive advice is, in many cases, way over the top. Although he understands well the ubiquity of microorganisms, he panics at the thought of their presence on the skin of a healthy person and in food.. How many of us think it is necessary, in all cases, to use a handkerchief on a door knob, or excessively clean the anal area after going to the toilet? After finishing this book the reader may not know which advice is excellent (wash your hands well and frequently) or is excessive (always discard food that has dropped on the floor.)"
3,Take it with a grain of salt...,"The author has done his research and tells you more about germs than you ever wanted to know. He also tells you how to avoid getting sick and how to clean just about everything properly. However, I could've done without the instruction on how to clean my anus. Yes, that really is in the book. After reading it, I was also left wondering how the human race has managed to survive. Putting the paranoia aside, the book had lots of useful information and good cleaning tips."
1,i did not want the rock version.,It should say in bold letters not the orignal song.Remixed a rock.....how fusterating.my daugher even downloaded the same song 2 times and we hate it.
3,An okay product,This product does not break down my foods very well. I been taking this pills for a couple of days and still not improvement with my acid reflux. Does anyone have a suggestion on the best digestive enzyme to take?
3,Good enzymes; I've used better at same price range,"These seem to aid digestion a bit, but other brand at the same price I normally use is much more effective at speeding-up digestion of high-protein foods."
3,For northern gardeners only,"Helpful booklet for those who garden in Wisconsin (sandy soils) and other northern climates (i.e. coast of Maine). The plant lists do not apply to Florida, Texas or the southwest."
1,Gardening in Sandy Soil,"A small, brief pamphlet that outlines a bit of information, but sorely lacking in specific detail or suggestions, like a list of plants that would do well in a sandy garden. Even at it's low cost, it wasn't worth the price."
3,Feels Like the Old Strip,"First off, the green baize and plastic roulette wheel with a BB inside are great packaging. The liner art is fantastic like all the Ultra-Lounge discs I've seen. The song selection isn't the greatest. It's interesting to hear some of these songs performed but instead of being reminded of the flashy and exciting Vegas, it feels a little second-rate like an off-strip slot parlor. I'm glad to have it and I'll listen to it again but I prefer Ultra-Lounge's Bachelor Pad Royale and the Wild Cool and Swingin 1 & 2 discs for a classy feeling."
5,Great Puzzle!,My 13 year son has been working on this puzzle off and on for the second part of the summer!!! He is enjoying doing it and it is almost finished!! Great project!!!
1,The Most Overrated Recording Ever Made,"(With the possible exception of Klemperer's Fidelio.)I am deeply comforted to see from other reviews that others are finally getting the message. As Mr Clinton's campaign team would say, ""It's the singing, stupid"". Do *not* be mislead by the starry names, this thing barks and yowls like New Year's Eve in the cats-and-dogs home.Do not pass Go, do not waste $35, go directly to Josef Krips on Decca Legends for three discs of perfect joy."
5,UnHypnosis Really Works,I think this CD really works. He is a great hypnotist. I can only say that I wish he would do one for eating.
1,WRONG BOOK!,"I ordered Course I, but I received Course III. I am exchanging and hopefully I get the right book this time."
4,Health related,It is what it says it is. There isn't that much more to say; it is what it says and does what it is supposed to.
4,Great recreation bow,A consistent shooting bow with 25 lb draw and a 13 lb holding power which allows for greater accuracy with less exertion. The custom contour grip is tailored for use by both right and left handers.Bow is 41 inches long with a 26 inch draw from a continuous cable. This compound bow is for recreation/ instructional purposes and is ideal for camping or school use. Easy to use!
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent training course. It is not just about UML, but puts UML into practice for an object-oriented approach. The video material is of a high quality and clarity. If this is the future of ""interactive"" training, then I am all for it. A worthwhile purchase."
4,Monster Home Series Power Protect,"I do not yet know how well this product performs because there have been no lightning storms or other power spikes since I installed it. However, for non-tech-savvy buyers like me, it would be helpful to know before ordering that an extra piece of TV cable with input and output ends is needed in order to install this product. I would have ordered this cable at purchase time if I had known I would need it."
2,was mine defective?,"The one I ordered works, but the plastic nub in the rear of the unit I received has a slightly-flawed location. The nub is intended to insert into the ground hole of your recepticle (outlet). My nub is slightly too high, preventing it to be plugged into a top outlet -- because of this nub, it'll only work in the bottom outlet. I see little reason for this plastic protruding nub to exist in the first place..."
5,"Ok, but not all that pratical",Takes up a lot of space off the wall....requireing more set back from the wall.
4,Perfect for a small LCD set-up,"I bought this with an LCD TV and I have to say it is perfect and does the job pretty well. It also has a small light on it to notify you of the condition. Monster products are somewhat over-priced but I went with it since it was obvious I got a quality product and it looks nice as well.Useful tips,Before plugging this in the outlet, make sure you use the plugs to open them up. Otherwise you will end up forcing them while this is plugged in and cause it to short circuit."
2,Too thick,"Hard to determine thickness of this, needs to have more pictures, but at 2.5 inches, it's pretty beefy when you are trying to place this behind a flat panel. The high joules make it a good product, but my intention with the purchase was to sink this into the wall, but when i got it, i realized that it had 3 prongs and just put into the existing outlet, so the thickness is from the wall out."
1,Not a Good Fit for WallMount TVs,I just got this surge protector from Amazon and returned immediately.I have a 52inch LCD mounted on wall with a Tilt Wallmount. So there is enough space to put this in...but when I plug the TV power cable into it..there is not enough space for the TV to tilt all the way back in...because the TV is butted against the Plug...If you can live with your wallmounted TV slightly tilted up...then you can have this....I can not ...so I just returned it....I searched for inwall surge protector all over amazon...but none of them have a pivot plugs.....so went to Fry's ...found one from Philips...perfectly fit in the back of my TV...as it has several pivot plugs...it costs me only $20 with 200k warranty..and 2000+ Joules rating...
1,Monster Products are a waste of $$$ and Fail often,I have owned several Monster Surge Protection products over the years and find them ALL to be overpriced and often fail or just stop working. I would not recomend Monster anything. The company is all about ripping off the customer.
5,Perfect fit,"This is a perfect fit for my LCD TV which is mounted to the wall. I installed an electric outlet right behind it so when the TV was hung, you wouldn't see any wires. I didn't want a regular surge protector that I would have to strap behind it, so when I got this it was perfect. It is the exact fit to the existing wall plate and very flush. I am happy with this. I even bought a second one and put it behind my fridge."
5,It Does What I Want,"My entire Home Theater is powered through a Panamax isolating / regulating power supply. All except my sub-woofer. I wanted to isolate it as well. I only needed a small socket mounted protection device and I found this item. It only takes up the lower socket on the standard wall socket, so you can still plug the vacuum into the upper one. The item has one more socket than I needed, no problem, I put a child-safety cover into the other one so nothing else gets plugged in. It also has a coaxial isolation for your cable, I don't use it. I give it five stars because it does what I want it to do, and it didn't break the bank."
4,"Good, but not what I thought","I though this would replace the outlet in the wall, instead it just plugs into it. My tv had plenty of clearance and the plug was a right angle one so it still worked out. It's nice and sturdy feeling, not sure if that means anything about quality."
4,Great product. Check out the vendors,"I purchased this twice because I liked its features a lot and got more. The first time, the unit came in an origional plastic wrap with instructions and warrenty info. The second purchase, the units came loose with no information in an unprotected cardboard priority mail envelope. 1 of the units had bent prongs and a missing ground prong. Questionable unit even though the company said it was original. I wouldn't have questioned this if I hadn't already purchased a privious product and seen the packaging iand literature. Since these are used for home electronics, I gave it a lower score. Had the vendor furnished original literature and packaged the units in an appropriate mailer, they most certainly would have received a higher score. 1st vendor gets a 5, 2nd vendor gets a 3."
4,Great protection with minimal effort,"This is a good product if you are looking for protection for a small TV or powered speakers but do not want to have a powers trip out in plain view. This is easy to ""install"" as you just plug it into the outlet and then plug the device(s) into the new outlet. No electrical work/wiring needed.Great product for a specific use."
3,Works but not on GFCI outlets,I had to modify the back of this to plug into my GFCI in my garage. There is a white nipple about 1/2 that was not lining up with the outlet so I shaved it off with a knife. It works now.
5,"Von Stade, Anderson, Ramey, Upshaw -- Excellent","i know anything is possible, but with a roster of singers like this, it would have been a shock if this recording was anything but a delight. von stade is captured on this recording just before she passed into the overly-mannered singing into which she now frequently lapses. ramey is perfection, as usual. june anderson is brilliant in her fiery aria and the aubade/vive amour qui reve scene is literally dreamy. also a chance to catch a relatively early dawn upshaw performance. highly recommended."
3,Interesting but aggravating,"As another reviewer put it about some of the items in this book, ""it may be nit-picking, but""...with this book, there is a lot of nit to pick. In spite of the impressive resources links at the end of the book, there is a bundle of inaccuracies all through the pages. Just to mention a few more than he did: Vern Stephens became one of the best outfielders (he wasn't an outfielder); Dodger outfielder Billy Herman (Babe Herman maybe); some old codger at the '44 Series was a Browns fan since 1869 (give me a break!); Danny Litwhiler had an RBI average of 82; Stan Musial was to play in the Mountain League (it was the Mountain States League); Sanders was the lead-off hitter for the Browns and batted in 102 runs (nobody ever did that before); plus a bunch of undoubtedly made-up conversations between players and batboys, etc. So, in spite of the many interesting things in the book, it became somewhat of a tedious read."
5,Masterpiece,"I have seen the movie before reading the books. This movie is indeed a masterpiece. I must agree with most of the viewers that most of us want more after three hours of the first movie. Three hours was about right although most of the people who has read the book want more. Some of the viewers dislike it and feel bored with it since they do not love fantasy movie in the first place. So my advice to those people, do not intend to watch it just because most of the people do and because it is a blockbuster movie. You might end up in giving bad review which to most of the people might not be true. I have read the book afterwards and I must say that Peter Jackson really done a great job in making the legend comes to life. All of the people involve in this movie deserve thumbs up. Even if this movie did not win some of the world award, I believe this movie has won many heart of the viewers."
2,I was not happy with the audio.,Audio was not clear even after I set the volume to be real high. Absence of close captioning made it worse.
5,Love it,Highly recommend for adults and children. My family really enjoyed it and will likely purchase for our home in the future.
5,Lord of the Rings,Lord of the Rings is a great movie to go see. The friendship and teamwork in this story are amazing and everything looks so real. If I could I would see it again and again.
5,C'mon,One of the best movies ever. Possibly the only movies that do the books justice. Star Wars fans need to bow down!
3,Sound Issues,The video quality is good but the sound is off. For some reason I kept having to turn the volume up to hear characters speak but then turn it down when the action scenes were in play.No subtitles is a bummer.
4,Good version,Everyone is buying blue ray so I got this extended version for a good price. Definitely worth it. Great movie and I always recommend the extended.
5,stunning picture quality,"I bought the blu-ray version of Lord of the Rings.when I dropped in the disk and the movie started, my jaw dropped open.The picture quality was stunning! Bright, clear, beautiful color. Looks better than I rememembered in the theater.How did I live without blu-ray all this time?!"
1,nap time,"I was so excited about watching this movie. In two attempts I fell asleep twice so I gave up. It was obvious there were great special effects and I enjoyed the book to a degree but just couldn't stay awake. Call me a 40 year old kid but I enjoyed Harry Potter much more. Thumbs down on this one for me unless you need help falling asleep.( I have noticed 25 people found this review unhelpful. I am not trying to slam the movie but just point out that for me, I couldn't stay awake through it.)"
3,This IS the book brought to life...,"What a great film to be made. I loved all the actors, the protrayals, the cinematography, the direction, the costumes, everything...But, it is as slow, tedious and dull as Tolkein's tepid writings. Sorry, T, but you rambled your way through a boring series of books, and Peter Jackson faithfully adapted it with the style and flavor of your pennings. Sadly, it isn't a great movie, but it is a triumphant and majestic work that will go the way of all bloated Hollywood flicks- noted obscurity: a fascinating bore for future generations. I blame none of the crew or cast...it is all Tolkein's fault."
3,The Fellowship...,"I, personally, have not seen all of the bonus features on the DVD, but I have seen the extended version of the movie. It was very good, but still my least favorite in the series."
3,THE BEST!!!!!,The Lord Of THe Rings is the best movie i have ever seen. Elijah Wood does a perfect job as Frodo and Sean Astin was a perfect Sam. All the other actors and actresses did perfectly were great too.
5,Christopher Lee Not important enough???,"I thought the film very good and I enjoyed it very much. My problem is with the bonus material. All the stuff about the location is fine and a lot of attention was given to the actors -all except CHRISTOPHER LEE! I feel that he had been slighted and not given his proper share of credit for being in this film, not even a mention from the director about how fortunate he was to have this man as part of his production. Mr. Lee deserves better than this, it's like he was shoved into the background and of no real importance to this film - WRONG!!! He was not given his just due for this film."
3,Rating is for amazon streaming service. Movie is 5 stars,"The movie gets 5. Even though this was in hd, it seemed to be optimized for tablets. Watched on a large screen tv streamed through an xbox, the image didn't make it. Tried adjusting using full screen, stretch or letterbox settings, but didn't make any difference. As a result, felt like I got half a movie. What I could see, the quality was good and it didn't buffer once."
5,great movie,tha lord of the rings:the fellowship of the ring is a great comedy.it was helarious.I crack up every time dat i watch this great funny movie.the funniest thought of it is dat they are so determined to get dat ring.ha.and they tell many funny jokez along on da way and my 2nd fav.most funny part is when they slay dat dragon.DARN IS THAT FUNNY.so go buy this awesome comedy on a night u wanna laugh.also the two towerz was even funnier dan dis comedy classic and im not lieing.i just wonder why my friendz or anyone else didnt think dis classic was funny.i guess they all have no sence of humor.
5,What planet are you from ??,YOU HAVENT SEEN THIS MOVIE ??? Moron your bus is leaving .. They have movie theaters here ... People go to them for recreation and entertainment ... This was one of the biggest epic movies of the century ! CLICK PURCHASE AND MOVE ON !!!
3,Lord of the Rings,I probably liked the Fellowship of the Ring best of the 3 video series. The series as a whole had to much fighting in the latter portion and not enough story.
3,Took me 11 years to watch this.,"I'm not going to lie and say it was great, because I don't think it was that great. It set up the plot for the next two films, and that's it. First time I tried to watch it was when it first came out in '02 and I didnt make it to the end because I fell asleep. I thought it was boring and didn't want to give the next two a chance. But after I watched The Hobbit (which came out in theaters fairly recently), I decided to see this movie again and I actually managed to get through the whole thing. That allowed me to continue the trilogy and after 11 years, I can finally say it was decent.Cinematography is excellent by the way. I just thought the story dragged a bit in some places and it was too long for me."
2,Good picture,"A must see movie but ...I feel the pictures of this movie are absolutely amazing.But I don't like the main charactors and the plot which Ibelieve are more important. You care about the charactorsonly when you like them.I won many awards, but it won more because of its formthan its essence, the story. I would have to saythis is the typical Hollywood style movie that only pleasesyour eyes."
2,"Show good, sound up and down like a yo yo",Show story line was good with excellent graphics. The sound varied from loud to long stretches of soft spoken words with British/Irish accents which made the show difficult to follow. Perhaps that is why in a theater it is acceptable with the high Wattage sound systems but with a TV the small speakers can not do the show justice.
3,DVD hesitates/freezes while playing,DVD hesitates/freezes while playing - I love the movies but was disapointed that the DVD freezes while playing the movie
5,One Set To Rule Them All,"The best adaption yet of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" from Tolkien's epic Lord of the Rings trilogy is now available in this superior director's cut. It also includes a National Geographic DVD and two finely crafted bookends (which look great holding up a DVD collection).Bonus and extended scenes make this showing nearly 30 minutes longer than the lengthy theatrical version. Some may say that's too long, but who cares? It's on DVD! Nature calls? Hit pause! Want to microwave some popcorn? Hit pause! Besides, it's a fantastic film. Those who have never read Tolkien or enjoy only the usual Hollywood drivel will probably find this film boring. However, those who enjoy great acting, direction, cinematography, editing and sound (or any combination thereof) will enjoy this modern classic."
5,Simply Beautiful,"The Lord of the Ring: The Fellowship of the Ring is a beautiful adaptation of Tolkien's book. The acting is superb, especially Ian McKellen as Gandalf. The special effects are great. The dialog rich and beautiful. I can't wait for the second part The Two Towers."
5,this movie was the best movie ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This was one of the best movies in the whole world. It had amazing special effects and perfect acting. It made laugh and cry. It was scary and funny at the same time.
2,Misprinted copy...,"I recently purchased this version of the movie, brand new in its factory sealed box. Part One (1st disc) worked fine, but Part Two (2nd disc) contains the same data as Part One. It is labeled properly and is definitely a legitimate copy (it's clearly not a fake), but was somehow produced with the wrong image burned to disc 2. I popped both discs in the computer to check out the volume titles and both are FELLOWSHIP_EXT_D1.This version of the movie is out of print so it's not like I can contact the manufacturer and get a replacement either :/"
3,I expected more,Okay I love these movies dont get me wrong but I dont think this deserves a 5 star rating neither do any of the other. They are nothing like the book Sam jackson butchord the story. It would have been great if he had called it a remaging instead of lord of the rings. How can any one who has read all 4 books and I do not mean audio books. Even say these movies are close to the book dont get me wrong i loved them and I own them all but not worth a 5 star
1,PROBLEM WITH DVD's,"This review pertains to the ""The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring (Platinum Series Extended Edition) (2001)"" ONLY. I have the two DVD version and thought it was so great (5 star rating) that I ordered the extended edition. This edition will not play on my laptop, which is where I watch DVD movies. When I instert the DVD's (and I tried all four) it spits them back out. I had no trouble with the other version."
2,Did not hold my interest,Could not get into this movie. Maybe I am a bit too old for it. I'll give it another try later on.
4,"Great Movie, But Way Too Long!","I just watched The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Extended Edition on Blu-ray. I loved it!The story flowed, the acting was brilliant and the scenery was beautiful! This is truly a must see!The only thing holding me back to giving this film five stars is it's length. At nearly four hours, it is much too long. Another problem is that there is not a lot of action. There was mostly dialogue. My final problem with this movie is that it lags a bit in the middle. Other than that, I enjoyed it.This movie should be okay for children over twelve. This film is much too violent for anyone younger.Other than that, The Fellowship of the Ring is a movie worth seeing.I recommend this movie."
3,like it,It is a great story but it takes too long to build up the storyline and establish each of the characters
2,Huge Disappointment,"A huge cinematic disappointment. The movie is entirely too long -- and the first 1.5 hours almost put me to sleep. There were way too many cheezy sentimatal moments that didn't advance the plot enough to warrant their inclusion. I can't believe that this film is getting so much hype (and some Golden Globe nominations), and moreover, that they have already filmed the next two. Whoever agreed to the $300 Million pricetag for all three movies should be fired."
2,What?,"Ha! Ha! I love films with Mother Nature but this is a ridicoulus sequel to ""Jonny Chinese""!WHo is Frodo?Frodo should run for MinimeMy favourite part was when Dr. PaulThis film includes some excellent cameos by Paul P. Borg(a Maltese Phyiscs teacher], David P. Farrugia( a Maltese Chesitry teacher) and Stephen Hawking(a person who is so lazy that he sits on his wheelchair all day and does not even move... not even to watch porne!). my favorit part was when frodo and gandalf got married and defeated Suraman with their brotherly love! (bluddy pervet) This film includes the very famous ""Let's make love on the kitc hen table"" scene!"
1,Terrible. 18th april 2004.,"Lord of the rings, not my type. Fighting,alot of action a lot. I do like the actioning films but not this type. By looking at the box, you can tell what sort of film it is going to be. Glad i didn't go and see it at the cinema couldn't of sat through 3 hours. Too much fighting."
1,it was bad,"I saw the movie on Christmas Day. I have to admit that the battle scenes and the special effects on them were good, on that I would rate it excellent. But thats all that kept me from walking away from the movie. The rest was plain boring. The plot in its self was good, but it took 20 minutes to climb a friggin mountain. Then when they got to the top there were even more. And most of the mountains hardly anything exciting happened. If they were to cut out the parts where nothing happens there would be two or less movies. Buy it on DVD when it comes out so you can skip that ...(stuff). DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME IN A THEATRE WATCHING IT!"
1,Worst EVER!`,Wow what a bad movie!! Elijah Wood was sleepwalking What a horrible choice to play the main role. 3hrs of NOTHING! Gandolf was monotone and Sam acted like a little girl. SLEEPER!!
5,Best Movie Ever,Peter Jackson has picked the best actors for this movie. They all fit there roles perfectly. The plot was awesome and true to the book and the special effects were amazing. Both of these movies (Fellowship and Two Towers) are wonderful and exciting. They bring you into the world of Middle-Earth.
3,Power Wench Wiring Kit,"The kit requires you to remove one of the ends from your existing wiring to plug into either the receptacle or the wench . Also, I found the wirings 6' length to be too short. Unless my truck and trailer were perfectly straight the wiring was too short. Even then the wiring was stretched tight. I ended up going to three different places before I was able to find the 8 ga. wiring that was needed (10ga. is the largest auto parts stores carry). I bought 8' of each red and black wire at Wilco which added $16.00 to my total. I would measure first to see where you would put the receptacle and how far it is to your wench. You might be better off fabricating your own system."
1,"So Inauthentic, What a disappointment!","I'm biracial, and a teacher of elementary children, many of whom are multi-racial or adopted children whose parents are of a different ethnicity. I was so hopeful when I bought this book, but the main character's voice is so unbelievable. No child of this character's age has the insights or identity development to say and do the things she does. I wish it had been the book I was hoping for. Very disaapointing."
2,Unrealistically inaightful,"Fiona Cheng is an eleven year old American girl with a Chinese father and a Scottish mother. She is ""half and half"" as she puts it, but is starting to realize that her identity is more complicated than two halves making a whole. Performing in her town's folk festival, Fiona wants to represent both of her halves but scheduling conflicts cause her to have to choose a side. Fiona's solution to her problem helps her realize that everyone has something different to offer about their own unique identity. Namioka's chapter book depicts a struggle to fit in that her readers will relate to, however her reflections on being biracial are at times too perceptive. Fiona's sophisticated musings on her racial identity sound more like a parent's contemplation on her mixed race child than her own. Written in a sometimes tediously moralizing tone, biracial readers of Half and Half may not find a character they can truly identify with."
5,Built to last,"I've had this ladle for two years now and for $10 I couldn't have asked for more. Sturdy, machine washable, and it doesn't get hot when left in the pan."
5,OXO Good Grip Steel Ladle,"I had this on my wish list. When I got it last year for Christmas I was thrilled. If I hadn't gotten it as a gift I would have bought it myself. Fabulous Laddle. It even has measurment marks on the inside of the laddle, when I opened it that was a nice supprise.Although I don't use it as a measuring unit. If you are serving set amount portions it comes in handy. The girp is also great. I am very pleased with this product."
5,Love it.,"Very sturdy and high quality, looks fantastic. It is big and barely fits into my top drawers, but I really prefer this over my last plastic one."
4,Very Happy,I'm very happy with this ladle. It looks great and was exactly what I was looking for. Definitely worth the price. Highly recommended.
3,So so,"It may be strong, but it doesn't look great and beauty what I expect. It is also a little bit heavy one. So if you are not much picky at design, you will like it. However if you care thr design, it will be better to by other one."
1,Never received my item twice,I never received the item I ordered twice!!!! There was no communication on their end and no resolution. Would never order again!!!
5,New way of Gospel,"This gospel album sounds different than all I have heard before.Just great.Greetings from Germany, where still only the traditional gospel style is known.But me and my group are working on it!Alex"
5,I LOVE THIS CD!,"When I first listened to this cd, I immediately knew that this young man is anointed. Him and his choir may be strange lookin' but they are definitely anointed. G.A. sings so smooth and anointedly, when they open their mouths it's like wow these young folks can sang!! The harmonies are so tight and beautiful, you can't help but sing along. Every song on this cd is slammin' but my favorite, I would have to say is ""It's Time Now."" The sound of the cd is very unique, and one thing I must add, out of all of the new Gospel music I have heard, I really felt this cd truly ministered. Five stars across the board!"
5,"Smooth, Soulful, and Christ-centered","If you buy one gospel album this year, make it this one. I had ""Superstar"" on repeat for the longest time!"
5,Listen from start to finish-no skipping!,"The CD is no substitute for the Word, however it can minster to you if you pay attention to the lyrics and let them speak to your situations. I recommend any one that doesn't have this CD to purchase it, you will not be wasting your money. Just listen from start to finish!"
4,Spiritually Inspiring,"When you're feeling beaten down or confused, this is a good CD to listen to you. It will inspire you to keep pushing forward."
5,Gets better and better!!,"****** 6 STARSThis CD is a treasure...The more I play it; the more I love it.The instrumental and vocal arrangements are perfection.If you want to get an idea of what's possible if you turn your gift over to the Lord, listen to this CD.2004 has been an incredible gospel music year. This CD is definitely in the Top 10 for 2004.PRAISE ON!! - Don't be afraid to be the original person God created YOU to be."
5,Refreshing,"I purchased this project because of some great reviews I read weeks ago. All of the reviews are on the mark. Ty Tribbett and G.A. is highly annointed. One the best tracks on the cd (#16) is added at the very end. You will not stop humming this tune for days. I had the opportunity to experience Ty Tribbett and G.A. live in D.C. it was mind blowing. This C.D. will change your life (if you want....buy the project..you'll get what I'm saying...)Musicianship, vocals, lyrics, stellar!"
4,Amazing Mixture,"What can I say its a really good contemporary and traditional mix of songs. I was really blessed and only heard about this guy by chance. Everyone needs to get this guy, young and old dont miss out on the blessings this album can supply."
3,GOOD MIXTURE,"With Ty being from Philly, it was good to see how he mixed the popular neo-soul sound with some new school funk to create a very nice tempo driven album that rocks the church and the streets. ""Everything"" ""You Are My Joy"" and ""No Way"" are in repeat on my CD player. After seeing Ty and GA's live performances make you like the CD even more. With Urban/Neo-Soul artists such as Ty, Mary Mary, Lisa McClendon, J-Moss, and even up and coming independent artists urban gospel artists like Joye B. Moore and Kaize Adams to name a few, I think the future of gospel music is in good hands."
3,Tye Tribbett & G.A.,"It's a good CD but it appeared to have a lot more ""things"" going on than just the music. I especially like the song, ""Everything to Me."" That's the bomb....."
4,A superstar of his day,Good reading what a sensitive intelligent gifted person he was. You would only understand this if you read this book.
5,Best book I've read in years.,"This book is an unmitigated delight. What a pleasure! Reading it is like spending time with a dear old friend. Harpo wisely steers clear of recounting anything about his movies and sticks to a hilarious recounting of his childhood, and an affectionate cataloging of his many wonderful and famous friends. Warm, witty, and full of heart, like the man himself."
4,Harpo on life,Easy to read. Goes from early childhood to big career. Very interesting to read how they became so crazy and entertaining.
5,A Definite 'GOTTA READ'.,"What an excellent book. I thoroughly enjoyed Harpo's narrative of his life and had no idea he was so involved in so many events of the day -- like the Algonquin Round Table. I knew nothing of his private life nor or his childhood growing up in poverty in NYC nor of the resourcefullness of his entire family in dealing with their economic status. Except for the usual Kindle typos, a quick and wonderful read with loads of pictures. What a full and wonderful life he led!!!"
5,absolutely fell in love with Harpo,"Loved this book, and fell in love with the man. What an amazing life. I was not a big fan of their comedy, but, I'm a fan of the spirit of this truly amazing family."
5,The greatest book ever written.,"When reading the other reviews I kept thinking, ""Yes! That's exactly what I thought when I finished it.""A friend of mine loaned the book to his doctor who, after reading it, began prescribing it to depressed patients!Humorous and heartwarming, even the tough guys among us will be profoundly touched. Believe me, YOU WILL NOT WANT THIS BOOK TO END!!!"
5,"I found the book humorous, informative, and entertaining.","Harpo Speaks was an attention grabber. I was thoroughly entertained from cover to cover. This is THE Book, if you are interested in the Marx Brothers, the Algonquin Round Table, and the early years of vaudville, Broadway, and Hollywood."
5,5 STARS!,This is an amazing story! Throughout this book I laughted out loud and I cried and I hated for it to end. I love autobiographies of the 30's-40's era and this is by far the best! My favorite section of the book being the adoption of Harpo's children. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in the Marx Bros.
4,The one and only Harpo Marx....and also a very nice man.,"I found a first edition of this book around 1967. And I enjoyed it tremendously. For a man who never saved photos or press clippings regarding The Four Marx Brothers, the stories told about Aleck Woolcott, the Algonquin RoundTable, were incredibly detailed.And this is where I have a problem with Harpo's book.In Joe Adamson's book, Groucho, Harpo,Chico--and sometimes Zeppo,it was pointed out that Harpo's memories were not all that reliable--one, he was born in 1888,not 1893--and some of his accounts were refuted by eye witnesses to the same.This is still a fine book, I just come away from it now with a different viewpoint--Harpo wanted you to read an entertaining account,in that it is not true,but true enough for one to know.By all accounts, Harpo was a very private man and all the while a garrulous personality."
1,Leonor Fini - Deserves Better,"Leonor Fini a giant of the painting world deserves a better book than the one presented by Ms. Seldson.The accuracy of the events that the author presents in her book are totally false and sometimes seems to be invented or created by the author's mind.As a very close friend to Madame Fini, and after spending many times together, and enjoying and feeling the presence, emotions and feelings that lived in her body, is sad to know that some authors like to make money by providing false statements and presenting a book as a biography, when it should be rated only as a book to look at the paintings shown on it.Art History has given to Madame Fini the place she deserves in the art world, books like the one presented here, I am sure will not damage the image and figure of Leonor.Leonor, ""Gatora"" as I used to call you, wherever you are, ignore the comments and remarks of the Seldson ""book""."
2,not impressed,"To speak plainly, Tucker does an adequate job as Manrico, but Leontyne Price, while acclaimed by most, fails to impress me here. There are better options than this..."
4,A Darker Twist on a Classic,"My son LOVES Scooby! So I thought it would be nice to grab the latest incarnation of the old classic.This series is actually quite entertaining and sticks to a lot of the classic ideas of Scooby and the gang, but does so with a much darker twist. It is still somewhat suitable for smaller children, but isn't as much slap-stick humor as the previous versions.However, these ""Volumes"" only contain 4 episodes. I really wish they had broken it down into Part 1 with 12 episodes, much like they did Season 1 Part 2 with 14 episodes."
4,Very Satisfied,I would recommend this seller - my book arrived in a timely manner and in very good condition.
3,simply wordy,"I bought this book for the text book in a jazz improvisation class. We haven't referred to it once. It is a ""simplified"" version of the author's Creative Jazz Improvisation meaning it leaves out most of the musical examples. This leaves lots of words. A mediocre but irrelevant cd is included."
2,Inaccurate Advertising,"The book did not include the play along CD as indicated in Amazon's book description. Amazon has not been able to provide the CD, so the usefulness or value of the book is dramatically reduced."
5,And the guys are sweet too!,"hey, I'm a theatre techie and I was the costume mistress for Forever Plaid (with 3 original members) in the fall of 2002 in Riverside, CA. What an amazing show. The guys couldn't have been sweeter to me and it was by far the show I'm most proud of in my career.As for the cd.. the next best thing to hearing the boys! Be prepared to fall in love and never, ever get the songs out of your head :)"
5,Second Best Thing to Seeing It!!,"Love, Love, Love this show! If you ever get to see a production, go! The music and singing is wonderful and I think it's funny enough for even young people, but you do have to be a little older to appreciate the Ed Sullivan tribute to the fullest! ;-D I listen to this often and it's great to sing along with. I'm going to see a performance of ""Forever Plaid: Plaid Tidings"" soon...hope it is as good!"
3,Broadway review with some goods songs,I saw this off Broadway and remembered enjoying it so when I saw the CD I decided to take a chance. It's OK but it was much better in person.
5,You had to be there,"I think there is a later version of this collection, based on a recent revival of the show in Las Vegas. Ignore it. This is the one to own. Probably the only people who can truly appreciate these performances are those old enough to remember the original ""guy groups"" imitated (or should I say reproduced) by this cast. That is, you must have been at least an adolescent in the early fifties, just before rock and roll replaced popular music. (Get it? R&R is popular, but not music.) However, it is quite possible that a few people from later generations, boomers and beyond, actually have some appreciation for melody, harmony, and sentimental lyrics. I hope so."
5,Wonderful CD- great way to keep the show memories alive!,"This is my most favorite play of all time. I have seen the live show 5 times now and I can't get enough. My favorite songs are ""Heart and Soul""- I got to go up on stage and play the top part with Sparky, ""Perfidia"", ""Lady of Spain"", and "" Undicided"" I'm only 14, and I deifnetly give this show and CD 5 stars!"
5,2 WW11 real life story of intrigue and espionage,"Holden and Palmer were terrific in this melodrama of Germany,Stokholm,Copenhagen during WW11. They portayed their roles realistically and the plot was interesting to trhe very end. Palmer was great as Marianna.The ending had a new twist which was believeable."
5,"great movie, I have watched it several times !!!!!","This is a good spy movie/love story. This is probably one of William Holden's best, well worth watching"
5,Finally,"I've been waiting for this movie to be on DVD since the day I got into DVDs. A superb movie, well-acted with a great plot. It is William Holden at his very best and Lilli Palmer was never more beautiful, and not just skin deep. As for the plot, believe me, you don't need a story-line. Just see it. I promise you, a true story worthy of your time."
5,Great Film,Nobody seems to ever have heard of this film before and after I saw it I could not believe the little recognition that it has recieved. A well done suspensful drama!
5,For spy film lovers....,"A thouroughly enjoyable film, based on a true story! Tense and a bit grim.Lots of first rate supporting actors.I really liked this movie.The Big E."
4,"Excellent story, well made film.","No need to rehash the story -- the other reviews here do that quite nicely. The film is powerful in an understated way, made particularly compelling thanks to excellent location work in many of the real locations, and of course, the suspenseful subject matter. Everything is well crafted, with lots of fascinating detail. My only minus was that I felt it was a bit heavy on narration. Nevertheless, the film will keep you riveted for 140 minutes, which can't be said for many current films. Sadly, the DVD contains no bonus features, which is why I couldn't give the product 5 stars. It would have been great to have a commentary about the real events, or even a little 10 minute featurette. Regardless, it's a worthy addition to your DVD library."
5,superb edge of seat spy thriller,"Theres no such thing as a bad performance by William Holden. He is outstanding in this film about sacrificing everything to save your country, opposing the evil Nazis and being involved in a cause greater than your own petty interests. Splendid cast outstanding performances by all."
5,The Movie is Better than the Book......Amazing in every way,I read this book back in the 1970's and I could remember it being one I just couldn't put down. Based on a true story this movie brings to life the behind the scenes dealings and mis-dealings of WWII.William Holden's performance is flawless. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.Absolutely a must see and one you'll watch again and again.
5,Exceptional!!!!,"Probably the best cd I have ever heard! I cannot say enough how much I love this, it is awesome!!!"
3,Need to know before you buy!,"Im geting sick of them puting out stufe we already have, Now Im not saying that I don't like this cd I do, But I think That they should put out songs that we have not herd before, Like put all her old lps on cd remasted?"
2,"Classic, wonderful film; bad Blu Ray transfer.","Of course this is a perfect movie, but......this is a VERY VERY VERY grainy Blu Ray. I don't know if it's a bad transfer or what.Maybe there's a better Blu Ray version out there.Again, great film, though."
5,Nice Clear Speakerphone!,This is a great speakerphone. It's clear and easy to use. I have tried out TONS of speakerphones and this one is by far the best one I have found. And you can't beat the price...there are many more expensive ones out there with alot less quality.
5,BODY FOR LIFE BOOKS,"Just wanted to thank you for the books only one mark, I have done this program before and its great, nice to get new books at such a great price.My old books were just to worn."
5,Thanks,"Dr Kuhn, in the Preface says that ""Years ago I was challendged to ask God to break my heart with the things that break His heart."" Few of us will have the courage or will to live such a self sacrificing journey in life. ""My Eyes, His Heart"" gives those of us who only dream of the journey a chance to feel a little bit of what Dr. Kuhn has lived for the last 30 years. It is a wonderful treat. Thank you Dr. Ted Kuhn.Heartwarming, heartbreaking, but above all eye opening."
5,"Why tell this story? It's a good story, with better music!","There is nothing worse than a weak story linked together with weaker tunes. However, Once on this Island is operatic in its beauty, organic in its execution (not a note out of place!) and is bound together with a strong story, stronger performances, and some of the most upbeat and uplifting music I have ever heard. The music brings you to the Antilles and establishes the place of this island, with its symbitioc relationship with nature and its gods. And you will root for Ti Moune and her faith in her place in the world, and even though she doesn't get the guy, it could be argued that she gets something even better.Give it a listen...."
5,Awesome,"This the best musical I've ever heard. I've seen this particular cast in action. The music is great. Even if you haven't seen the play, just add it to your collection. You'll thank me for it later."
5,A Must for anyone - Great music to make your life better,"Everyone must go out and buy this album! It's the greatest. Flaherty and Ahrens do some wonderful and creative things with the music. Further, the emotional songs make you want to move with the music. Who can not help dance during Mama Will Provide or cry during A Part of Us. And my favorite song, Some Girls, is the best! They hit these songs right on the dot and all the actors are wonderful. They have full voices that shine during every song. You must buy this CD!"
5,A hidden gem of Broadway,"After learning that this was our high schools spring musical, I naturally went out and bought the CD. I loved every minute of it. The plot was extremley basic, but the music made it seem more comlex. The woman who plays Ti Moune on the recording is phenominal, along with the woman who plays Asaka. Mama Will Provide, We Dance and Waiting for life are excellent. When we preformed this (back in early may) there were a few seconds of silence after Why We Tell the story, and the audiance erupted in praise. It is truly a great Broadway musical, filled with all 3 components, catchy, show stopping numbers, great sets and costumes and a great book."
5,An enjoyable musical with a simple plot,Flaherty and Ahrens did a wonderful job creating this piece! They and Graciela Daniele knew what they were doing when they cast it!
5,Sweet!,"I love this musical! I'm runing spot for a college production, and I'd love to play Papa Ge. It's just so much fun to be evil-ish and such..."
2,It's no Ragtime,"Lynn Ahrens and David Flaherty, who made the brilliant Ragtime, are not on top of their game with this one. Ragtime is the best musical written in at least the past twenty years (if not all-time) and this is pretty lousy."
2,"Strange, Strange, Very Strange, But Good.","This is just a weird musical. I mean for god's sake, the leading character turns into a tree at the end. I saw this play at a high-school once. I must admit I cried at the end, but for god's sake, the use of scenery bothers me. I mean, I know it's supposed to be told by peasents, but atleast have a decent backdrop.The cast album is very, very, very, very strange. The orchestrations are fine, but the cast is weird. I really must admit I thought the two people playing Tonton and Mama have some of the worst voices and worst acting skills.The girl playing Timone is good. She's good, but the show could do without her. The team of Ahrens and Flaherty could do without this show, but hey! Thank god it got better with Ragtime!"
4,GREAT show!,"I can't believe so few people have heard of Once on this Island! It's a beautiful touching story. The only reason I give it a 4 rather than a 5 is the fact that, unlike such albums as Tick, Tick... Boom! and RENT, this can't just be listened to all the way through, over and over... it needs to be seen."
5,Awesome cd!!!,"My school is doing this play and when I heard about it I wanted to find out more because I've never heard of it. When I got this cd I was amazed!! It was so good. I can never stop listening to it. I think it is one of the best cd's I've ever gotten. I absolutely love ""Mama Will Provide"". I think that everyone should get it. You really will enojoy it!!"
5,It deserves six stars!,"Seeing this musical not only sold me on it's great score, but it took it's place as my favorite play. When listening, it's extremely difficult to resist the temptaion to tap your feet or snap your fingers. It's upbeat and energetic, and it leaves nothing to desire. A must if you are a Broadway fan, or just looking for some great (although different) music!"
5,3 WORDS FAB-U-LAUS!,"Once on this Island is an INCREADABLE story..my high school is putting it on this year and although its a TON of work its TOTALLY worth it! When I first heard the CD I feel in love w/ the characters and music..you are really DRAWN into the characters and their story. This is a wonderfully well written moving story, I feel privilaged to be able to do it!"
5,You can love this soundtrack even if you haven't seen the play,"I first saw this play about 12 years ago produced beautifully by the Repertory Theater of St. Louis. It was wonderful! I have owned this music on vinyl, then on tape, and am now buying it for my MP3 player.The wonderful thing about this soundtrack is that it is the entire story told in music. There is no spoken dialogue needed in this play. If you listen to this music you will understand the entire story (and it's such a lovely story!)The other wonderful thing about this soundtrack is that the music is of the sort with which you can - and will want to - sing along, dance along, repeat some tunes depending on your mood, and hum in the shower. The performers are wonderful and the music is memorable and the story is timeless.This is a unique and masterful production. You'll never get tired of this music. Enjoy it."
5,My Favorite Broadway Musical!,The carribean melodies are hyphotic! The CD moves through this brilliant story with a narrative ease. I've seen many musicals and this is no doubt my favorite. The CD is great for any collector!
5,an important tool in a classroom,"I have used this product in a high school musical theater class setting....many of the tunes included are great performance songs my students will be using in our upcoming end of the term concert... they love this unique musical style, so do I..."
1,"UGH, I reallllly wanted to like this, but....","Shannon was far too whiny and neurotic to take. Seriously, does this girl not have any friends?? I put it down after 100 pages intending never to pick it up again...I did, however, figuring Shannon has to show some growth, figuring there had to be some character arc in the story...No, there never was.On the plus side, I enjoyed the writer's style and I will buy her next book. I just hope the main character has a life."
2,"Engrossing enough, but shallow","I read the book pretty quickly and it held my attention at the time, but really, it left no lasting impression. No characters were developed enough to make me particularly care about them, including Shannon, the narrator. The dilemmas and problems she faced are familiar enough ground that to make her book stand out, she needs to have something more than just a recitation of life events, but alas, that's all this was. Can't say I recommend it."
4,Funny and original,"I enjoyed Welcome to my Planet more than Bridget Jones' Diary. Shannon seems so real - in fact, I was often reminded of one of my favorite books, She's Come Undone by Wally Lamb. I love her very original take on life, and her sometimes sarcastic and bemused comments. As a Minnesotan, I enjoyed the local flavor of the book - St. Olaf College referred to as Uff Da U, and mention of Southdale Mall, etc. This book is entertaining and touching - I LOVE Flo, her mom. I've been recommending this one to my friends."
2,bland,"I too read this book quickly... devoured even. But it doesn't stick. I didn't like the main character... or hate her for that matter. I needed to feel one of those emotions. In my opinion, Shannon is a whiner (character not author). I couldn't figure out what her problems were. I wish that people in my age group wrote books that had some lasting resonance. This feels like a fad of a book that won't be remembered after a few years. Which is too bad, cause being a 30 something Minnesotan who attended the University of Minnesota and is a bit overwhelmed by life from time to time, I should have been this book's most ardent fan."
2,OYE!!!,"I bought this book simply because I heard excellent reviews. I started to read it last year and the only thing that kept me turning the pages was from mere shock. In shock that the book didn't get better. I found myself skimming the pages--as if I had to read it for a class and was being tested. I read the book and had to put it away and came back to it months later--I finally fininshed it feeling way more depressed. Depressed that I had spent all that time reading this book! All in all, it was well written, and I would not be shocked if others enjoyed this. I simply believe it takes a certain type of sense of humor to enjoy such a novel. I suppose we read books to maybe get a better insight on life or to ""escape"" if you will from reality--this book did neither of those things for me. :("
2,Not very interesting,"I started reading this book, and 100 pages in, i had to stop. Shannon is a huge whiner, and this book is just her ranting about how bad her life is. Personally, I thought it was a waste of time and i would not recommend it, even for a beach book."
2,Lacking,"I found this book to be lacking any story line. Quite often I wondered if I was missing something. I also found the main character to be quite annoying and wanted to tell her to quit whining. There were some cute moments in the book and the reviews looked good, so I stuck with it, but over all I think it was a waste of my time."
2,Not the book I hoped it would be,I completed agree with Jilly Bean's review. I kept reading this book even right up until the end expecting to find the purpose. Some portions were enjoyable but I never really felt that it was going in a clear direction. It was quite a disappointment overall.
1,Can we please move along?,"Ugh!! Reading Ms. Olson's book was not a fun ordeal. The story was extremely fragmented. I know it's a little ""in fashion"" right now to write in an off-the-wall style but at least give us some adventure and some laughs.I kept reading and thinking ""The next section will move the story along. The next section will not be so hum-glum. The next section will be funny.""It just didn't happen. I read one review that compared this book to Bridget Jones. I don't think it even comes close in the humor department.I love reading and I'm usually open minded. This book made me feel I'd been really wasting my time."
5,i freakin' loved it!,"maybe its because i can identify with the target binges and desperately need that patch she is trying to get a patent for or maybe its because i too have had the glorious image of beaming a stapler at my boss's head, but either way i fell in love with this book. shannon's characters are very real. you can identify, emapthize, love and/or hate them. her writing is adult but not vulgar. it is simple but not stupid. i have recommended this book to every one of my girlfriends, as we too find ourselves staring 30 in the face and have no idea what we want to do when we grow up."
3,confusing ending,"I liked the book a lot. I read it twice, actually.I did not understand the ending at all."
4,Compelling and Bonus...Funny too!,"Our heroine is also named Shannon Olson, even though it's fiction. I didn't quite get that, but oh well. Her life isn't perfect which is exactly what makes her human and enjoyable, especially given that she's quick to laugh at herself. Nothing better than an honest writer who keeps things moving along! This book is heavily into the mom - daughter relationship and it makes for an amusing time. We also read about her adventures with a long suffering (and sometimes boorish) psychologist as well as two of Shannon's love affairs. There is a bit of profanity that wasn't needed, but this book is true to life, imminently readable, and humorous. Enjoy!"
4,"Love it, but got a little lost...","I love this book, but with the jumping around of past and present tenses, I sometimes got a little lost between what was going on and what had already happened. I can relate to this book more than almost anything else I've ever read though. I'd recommend it for anyone who doesn't know what they want or where they're going in life."
2,Somewhat Conceited,"I'm a little uncertain as to how to describe this book... thinly veiled autobiography or work of fiction? I found it disconcerting that the author couldn't find it in her to develop new characters and used her own name, occupation, habits and quirks, as well as those of her parents. The ending suggests an slightly fictionalized autobiography; in which case this book is a rather unimaginative tale of ""woe is me."" Definitely not a lighthearted read. I, too, would suggest the library version. Not something to read over and over."
2,Nothing special,"This is yet another angst-ridden (but trying to be funny) account of a directionless woman dealing with approaching thirty spawned by Bridget Jones. This territory has been covered before with more wit, style, originality and humor (by Elinor Lipman and Laura Zigman for example). Unlike other readers, I could not relate to Shannon at all despite sharing many similarities with her. I found her boring and irritating. Based on the other reviews, I had been hoping for and expecting much more. Don't bother."
1,A Waste of Time!,"I loved Bridget Jones, and Jemima Jones, and thirty-nothing, and expected a great read because of this book's adorable cover. I was sooo wrong...and consequently sooo annoyed. The writing is terrible, the plot is quite confusing, and there are way too many sexual references, which I found quite disgusting. Save your time (don't even borrow it from the library!!)."
5,Intellectual control and power,"This is an astounding set of preludes. Right from the start Weissenberg's intelligence in crafting the central climaxes of the preludes is clear, and his ability to shape each one so it seems like a lucid whole is marvelous and extremely satisfying. The other reviewers are spot-on: this is a concert-hall performance of electrifying pianism. Op 32/4, 10 and 13 are given overwhelming readings, as well as op23/2 which presents a good illustration of Weissenberg's superior pianism, whether it be in the stormy outer sections or the lyrical central one, all of it is played with consummate mastery of the piano.The slower preludes may receive more expansive readings elsewhere, but as a whole this cycle is hors concours for its magnetism and tasteful speed."
3,Not bad for the money,"I really wanted to love these shoes, they are a great look but not quite as comfortable as they look. First, they run a little on the large side so if you are between sizes PICK THE SMALLER SIZE! I found that these do not stay on my foot particularly well. The back does something a little strange and my heel does not fit securely against the back of the shoe...not the end of the world but not great either. Overall, I would say they have somewhat of a bizarre fit. My feet are a touch narrow, perhaps these shoes would be better on someone with a broader foot?? I have other pairs of Jessica Simpson shoes and all of them have been quite comfortable so I don't really know what happened with the design of this pair.On the good side, the leather is super soft and the construction appears quite good and, as mentioned earlier, they are really cute shoes!!"
5,super cute,"I really liked these shoes; however, I thought they were NOT true to size. I listened the previous review stating they were too big. I found that not to be the case for me. I'm a true 7 when the shoe is an open toe, unfortunately, I had to return for a 7.5. The elastic was rubbing on my heal. I just know I would get blisters if I kept the snug fit. Remember the elastic will push your foot forward. Hope this review helps! Oh..the price is right and I'm confident they will be comfortable once I get the correct size."
2,just didn't flow together well,"The book just didn't seem to read smoothly, almost like the author was trying to force the content together from a larger source of content. If the author knows a significant amount but cannot put it together coherently, then don't publish the book."
5,Outstanding information for anyone new to gold Prospecting.,"In short, this author has many years of experience and he backs it up with common sense, keep it simple - cost saving ideas for anyone wanting to learn more about gold prospecting. Chapter VI alone, titled ""Nickel Knowledge"" in my opinion, made the price of this book a bargain.The basic information on pages 94 & 95 on how to sort Gold by size and additionally explaining how the weight of Gold is always determined in ""Troy Ounces"" was instrumental in establishing a strong/solid base of knowledge to build onto about Gold Prospecting."
3,I Hope it's Helpful,"I'm actually going to take a short trip to an old gold field, so I wanted this as a reference. As stated by others, there is a lot of advertizing going on as you read through the book. I haven't felt as if it wasted my money, by any means. It remains to be seen whether it really is useful."
2,Fear No Man! Jujutsu DVD,"I got this DVD, primarily, because it was inexpensive. The content is OK, basic. I've studied just enough Japanese JJ to know this instructor is qualified. You can argue about whether or not his techniques would work under duress -- an argument you could make with any martial art -- but what he is teaching is standard Japanese JJ. Like any other martial arts DVD, you can pick up some good techniques and ignore what you think doesn't work.The production quality, lighting, sound, is pretty amateur, as if the instructor borrowed a friend's video camera and shot everything on a Saturday morning. It's not bad enough to be a distraction though, and you are able to see the moves. But this is clearly low-budget.Biggest complaint: The title: ""Fear No Man!"" is as dumb as it is arrogant, and that is a dangerous combination. After watching this DVD, if you honestly feel that you can ""fear no man"" then you should book a room in advance at your nearest ICU."
1,Jointer,I cannot get the fence to be square on both the infeed and outfeed tables. It was supposed to be factory set to perfection. It would cost me too much to send back and get a replacement that will possibly have the same problem. Buying products like this online is not advisable.
3,bracelet,I good stocking filler. Flimsy but quite pretty. Probably find its way to the bottom of the drawer but was liked.
5,So cute!!,"I love this bracelet! It is so adorable, sturdy and affordable! I have been searching for a lady bug bracelet just like this. I got one for my mother too from the same seller. Hers is 18k gold over sterling silver."
1,Please don't but this frog,"This is the first time I've been compelled to write a review and, unfortunately, it's for all the wrong reasons. This book is awful. The heroine is judgemental, condescending, annoying, completely full of herself and neurotic to boot. All of this and a psychologist too! I was hoping that she would end up with the secondary love interest(the bad guy)it's exactly what she deserved. The hero deserved better and so do we."
5,This is great non-fiction,"Mr. Davies was a wise, interesting man. Much of his book is devoted to reviews of other author's books, but if you're curious about Mr. Davies himself, there is plenty of insight into his character. The essays are all intelligent, wise, and intriguing. Mr. Davies believed that most books are too long and could be shortened without affecting the quality of story. All these essays were written for a newspaper - Mr. Davies had a lot to say and very little room to say it. It is the economy of his words that carry the day. It's always a pleasure for someone to practice what they preach. Bravo."
3,Sunday Best,"Usually, there is nothing more dead than someone's old newspaper columns. A quick take on the passing parade is normally gone as soon as said parade is. This collection of Robertson Davies' bread and butter writing newspaper writing is anything but stale.Davies' old Sunday columns from various Canadian newspapers date back nearly half a century from the time of this book's publication. As he limits himself mostly to great literature and writers, the pieces have aged well. Davies comes across as a rather avuncular feuilleton, serving up tidy little takes on Dickens, James Agate, the Welsh verse form known as the englyn, and a slew of other famous and once-famous figures.Don't misunderstand: this is not the most timeless stuff Davies ever wrote. But it is a good collection of his marginalia, which has the rare virtue of never being trivial."
3,"I'm a fan, but a disappointed one","Having been known to go without groceries to attend one of her concerts, and owning most everything she's ever recorded on CD, on tape or on VHS, I would describe myself as a Cheryl Wheeler fan. And I have never failed to find on each of her productions three or four ""stop what you are doing and listen to this"" songs--until now. Listening to ""Defying Gravity"" over and over again, I find the accompaniement over-produced, at times amateurish, and often irritating. While the songs are ""nice"", there are none that grab you by the collar and swing your attention around to them. But, it's still Cheryl--the images are as clear and sharp as ever, her playing is clean and pleasing, and her voice is still as smooth and as sweet as honey-wine--and for this alone could I recommend this CD to another of her fans. Yet there's a big something missing that I cannot quite find the words to describe--I'm listening to her CD, ""and I'm crying but I don't know why..."""
5,This one should be in everyone's IPOD,My name is Teresa.I really can sit and listen to this one over & over again. I have all her cd's & Cheryl continues to beat the best.......Try it. You will like it.
5,Defying Gravity by Cheryl Wheeler,"I found Cheryl during the ""heyday"" of Napster, bought all of her albums, she never fails to please!!!"
4,Calm and to-the-point...,"This book is what got me started on Sartre, it's fairly easy to follow and it explains the basics of Sartre. Quality reading that gets you thinking... GET IT NOW!"
3,this is the Title for my review,"Kissin is a great virtuoso, and has a technique that allows him to play extremely difficult repertoire. However, his tone (in almost every recording) is not controlled and sounds very harsh in comparison to his projection. In the passage preceding and including the climax of the first movement of the Rachmaninoff Concerto no. 2 Op. 18 Kissin doesn't sound very big in comparison to the orchestra and at times it is very hard to hear him. Sometimes he takes the piece at speeds which I think should go faster. I think Richter's recording of this piece is much more beautiful and exciting.The haydn concerto and shostakovich are both recorded by martha argerich on a single album which I think is much better in comparison."
3,ok for the money,"For the money, this bag has worked fine. I have a comment on the style of the opening however. There is a ripcord type closure, with an additional velcro tab on the flap. The ripcord makes it somewhat inconvenient to get in and out of the bag quickly, and it often gets caught on the velcro. In the future, I'll spend a few extra dollars for a better entry system, and more internal pockets to aid in organization."
2,a back pack that won't stay closed!,"If you have kids (and I suspect you do to be buying a diaper bag :), you'll be bending over a fair amount, and would probably appreciate a backpack that doesn't disgorge its contents onto the sidewalk when you do so. If that's the case, don't buy this bag, as there's no way to get it to close securely because of the placement of the velcro. Even if you cinch it with the ripcord thingie, if you use the handle to grab the bag, the velcro will open. If you leave the ripcord open, it's even worse. It's just a terrible design and negates any positives about the size and features of the rest of the bag. I wonder if the makers of these products ever read reviews...it seems like they could very easily redesign the top flap and make a decent bag, but as it is, it's very frustrating to use."
4,I love it!,"I was skeptical when I first bought the product (after reading reviews on here) but it was a lot bigger than some reviews portrayed it to be and has worked wonderfully for 6 months now. The only qualms I have with it (which is why I took 1 star off) is that the zipper thread has fallen off both zippers and makes it hard to zip - while easily remedied by some new string, it still doesn't deserve 5 stars if an important part is hard to work :)."
5,Excellent,I used the FHAO (Facing History And Ourselves) book when I studied the Holocaust and disliked the way that they approached the Holocaust. This book is well thought-out and extremely well written. I recommend it to everyone.
2,not so good,well i got this book with cds to help me learn danish so i could speak to my friend in her native languge..well she even said that the way they teach new people danish is crap... I dont understand what is going on I end up having to have her explain everything they are saying in the book so a waste of money..she is just teaching me online... i learn more just talking to her.. the book is alittle help but not recomended for you if your just learning and never spoke or heard danish...
1,Not helpful at all,"Such a shame - very seldom do I end up buying a book as poor as this one! Besides having awful art work to go by, the instructiveness is not very good. I suppose if you like quick, childlike sketches, this would be interesting, but it didn't do it for me. If I hadn't waited so long, I would return it."
5,You'll want to read this in addition to The Water Castle...,"Two great books about a young girl - to young woman's -experiences in Vienna during and after WWII. In some ways, this sequel to the war book, The Water Castle, isdarker, sadder. The Water Castle feels more like a fable,and is rather twinkly even at the century's most hideous moment. The Water Castle, from the grown girl''s per-spective, delivers the weight of the destruction...the detritus of war, dreary and sad, and yet, at the same time, sheretains the ability to be romantic about life, to remember her questionably-involved parents with love, and to fall in loveherself. Highly recommended storytelling."
3,Fooling Around (Right?),"I think that this book is as crazy as Living Together these books are becoming very boring. Elizabeth is still screaming at sam and it is obivious she likes him, but she is to chicken to tell him! Jessica is still trying to be like she always has a flirt. I thought she was going to be so responsible i don't think so. i give this book 3 stars."
1,Boring...,"Gosh - how many ways can I say boring? This is a historical novel, it is not supposed to be one of the typical sweet regency romances that Ms. Hern writes. Only this is really a longer version of a sweet regency. The book is 375 pages of sweetness. Verity is sweet. Her love for the dark forbididng Lord Harkness is sweet, his feeling that he is too crazy/dirty to offer his love is sweet. Yada, yada, yada...I don't know - the village folks are terrified of him yet no one leaves. He gives them homes, jobs, food and they are cruel to him. And he stands for this? His mother-in-law, well, she is a nut case and he puts up with it? Yes, there is the whole guilt thing but did anyone else note he never, ever mentions his dead son? Does he visit the grave? It was like a non-event. And he is Lord of what? Is he an Earl, Viscount, what?? Only diehard sweet regency readers should read this one."
2,"Interesting premise, weak plot (contains spoiler)","The way that the two lead characters meet is unusual and promised an interesting story, but unfortunately the author couldn't hold it together. The bad reputation of the Earl is unconvincing, given that the people around him knew him his whole life. The eventual villain is too convincing as a friend of the Earl to turn out to want him dead. Considering how good some Ms. Hern's other books are (The Best Intentions being one), this one was a real disappointment."
2,WEAK!,"Oh, you'll flip through the pages alright! To skip over 3/4 of the book! Great idea, that's what made me buy the book. But the weakest writing I've ever read!"
4,great toy,"Got this because it was real cheap and I liked the spanish language part. DD (bought when she was almost 2) liked it then and a year later she still plays with it. Niece (18 months) also enjoys it. Great put and play type toy, door was a little hard for the younger age to open, but once they figure it out, usually can do it. Comes with a fair amount of coins, so still works great even if a few get misplaced. Go for it--worth the purchase."
3,"Almost, but not quite","Fry's novel is a sometimes gripping ""beach read,"" but lacks the substance to be anything more. A modern re-telling of ""The Count of Monte Cristo,"" ""Revenge"" suffers from some serious plot holes (where did Ned pick up his incredible business acumen? He reads a few Internet magazines and suddenly is the next Bill Gates?) and lacks character development (Portia, in particular, is a one-dimensional character - it is hard to understand what makes her so fascinating to Ned and Gordon...). However, Ned's amazing escape, plotting and ultimate, well, revenge, make this a fun read for those who can check their skepticism at the door."
3,Not original enough to be a Fry's best,"Stephen Fry is a well-known comedian, actor and fabulously funny writer - he is in fact a Oxford graduate. I have enjoyed his other books tremendously. This book, based on Dumas' ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" about revenge, betrayal, love and innocence is well-written and set in the 1990s dot-com era. It is a cute story and Fry's inventiveness to use anagrams of the original characters in Dumas is interesting. But the story never really gets off ground, the characters aren't interesting. I was a little disappointed."
3,A Modern Count,"As others have mentioned this book is essentially a retelling of the central theme of the Count of Monte Cristo. Revenge is very readable, and a good escapist novel. BUT, I found that by cutting the # of pages by 80% much of what was reasonable in the original became forced. I was left with a feeling that had Mr Fry perhaps been willing to devote another hundred pages or so this would have been a great book. Instead it is an enjoyable read, but winds up feeling way too implausible, with too many coincidences lining up just perfectly."
2,"Lazy, lazy, lazy","Having read other Fry books which were funny and inventive, this one was disappointing. It feels like Fry hurried through writing this book to meet a deadline or something. In Dumas' original, the revenge part of the story unfurled at a pace fitting to the amount of plotting that preceded it. In Fry's version, he rushes through like he's in a hurry to get the book ended. Skip this and read the Dumas- you can skim through the parts that are overwritten and still enjoy a better telling of the tale than this one."
2,a poor clone of The Count of Monte Cristo,"I heard the author interviewed on the radio and he said he'd written a chapter and a half when he realized he was writing the Count of Monte Cristo (but since Dumas stole the story he figured could to).I should have re-read Dumas's classic instead. This isn't a classic. Somehow it isn't as rich in details. The original was very complicated. This is thin, flat and unsatisfying. Somehow Fry's story has more white space in the text, you just feel you are missing out on the beautiful details and plot twists and complexity of characters.Dumas made each act of revenge seem fitting. Fry makes it seems just dirty and petty. Dumas had characters with doubt, Fry has characters too flat to doubt.Go read Dumas, the (original) book was better."
3,"A Little ""Heads Up""","I have nothing in particular to add te the previous reviews, only I would like to say that it is the same novel as ""the Star's Tennis Balls"". Don't buy both of them."
2,Story is a movie waiting to happen,"If the Count of Monte Cristo was not recently remade into a movie, this one would be destined to be made into a movie staring Matt Damon next year. The writing was enjoyable and and it was a quick read but it was such a direct take off the original Count of Monte Cristo that the suspense was never there. The only difference was it tried to add a ""feel good"" ending that did not really work.If you have never read the Count of Monte Cristo or really like classics that have been updated to include cell phones and the internet, this is not a bad book. If you prefer original thoughts and themes - get the original."
2,Adequate,"It has some amusing bits, but the author trudges through the plot with little grace or style. The idea of updating the classic revenge novel has a great deal of merit, but this is not the book that pulls it off. The ending is classically and depressingly modern British and as such is unsatisfying to anyone who does not have bad teeth and live in an awful climate. Perhaps the audio version will benefit more from Mr. Fry's excellent sense of comic timing."
2,a fairly stupid tale,"Mr.Fry's Revenge tests the credibility of the reader to the extreme. His character not only learns seven or eight languages from his tutor as easily as you learn to chew gum, but he can speak those languages so perfectly and without any accent, that he can pass as a native wherever he goes. He also acquires an amazing proficiency in business which would provoke serious jealousy to more than one executive of Enron. Not to mention that the character shows up in England out of nowhere with a misterious identity which no one can blow wide open , as if such thing would be possible nowdays (try to sell this idea to to Britains tabloids!). I frankly think that Mr. Fry found in ""the Count of Montecristo"" tale an inspiration for making some good money writing a book without putting much effort on the task. That is brilliant!. And fraudulent also!"
1,Don't buy this junk,"I ordered two, thinking it was a great design. The idea is great, but somewhere this went really WRONG! I can't tell if a made in China issue or if the design is just that poor. The force required to turn these two was just crazy, they wouldn't stay on the bottle. I sprayed one with Silicone as that will usually do the trick with a plastic on plastic part. No luck! Hopkins needs to find the source of the problem and fix it or just not sell this model at all. It's total JUNK and I can't rate it lower than 1 star."
2,Missing something,"Is it me or is it the book? I just found it to be a boar [s.i.c]. The writing was certainly clever but alas, I only made it to p. 94. Stop. Move on."
5,Hats off to Richard Grant,"A lovely lovely book. Richard Grant has upped the ante on Peter S. Beagle's talking raven and dead folk from ""A Fine and Private Place"" like a writer on a dare and morphed and mutated and created a book so original and wild and funny that it bears re-reading and re-reading. This book impressed the hell out of me. And besides, Tex and Molly listen to some of my fave 60s tunes."
5,"This is a sly, hilarious, and very knowing Pagan book!","If you're a contemporary Neo-Pagan, Witch or Druid, you'll meet your friends and neighbors in here, and perhaps even yourself- this is a great, laugh-out-loud, heart-filled send-up of hippie nature religions. What would you do if you died and actually met all those deities and nature spirits you worship? Would you sit back and say 'way cool!'?"
1,WHERE'S RHAPSODY RABBIT?,"Bought and loved Volume One, but of course I was hanging out for the Bugs Bunny masterpiece Rhapsody Rabbit.It wasn't there so I thought they'd saved it for vol. 2.BUT IT ISN'T THERE .. and to compound that injury, Warners have cut volume size from 3 to only 2 Blu rays.What gives? Is this just to make us shell out for a third volume? Or will Rhapsody Rabbit never see the Blue light of day?"
5,Quick and easy review,"Quick and easy review: What can I say, this has all the classics I saw as a kid.Porky Pig, Buggs Bunny, Twenty etc.Quality is great!"
2,Extremely Disappointed,"I ordered this item because of the Tex Avery MGM cartoons included in it. Wow! ""Red Hot Riding Hood,"" ""Swingshift Cinderella"" et al on Blu-ray! Sharp, brilliant high definition! Imagine my disappointment when the product arrived, I loaded up the disc containing said MGM Avery treasures, and it looked like I was watching them on VHS. Thanks for making it clear, Product Information, that these Avery cartoons are in ""standard definition"" (though they look even worse, with those intermittent comb-like parallel black lines that appear occasionally in the image in certain digital videos). My excitement face-planted to disappointment just like that.Caveat emptor... suckers!"
1,Blast and Whisper - waste of money and time,Extremely poor quality and acting. I only watched a few minutes. Too bad Amazon doesn't give money back on video's this awful!!!
1,Blast And Whisper,I found this movie to be very confusing and boring.I read my bible and was trying to find the biblical point of view with this movie. I guess I will give it another try and try watching it a 2nd time.
2,Blast and the Whisper,"I should have read the reviews before purchasing! I was disappointed because I had expected a higher quality level. I know that many Judeo/Christian movies tend toward B quality and I choose to rent them anyway however I do feel I was a bit mislead about this one. I tried to watch it, really I did, but alas after 25 minutes I had to turn it off. I think it was the props that did it. I just couldn't take it seriously. The makers meant well and I admire their initiative but to agree to rent it out on Amazon surely wasn't a good idea. The movie description should clearly state it is an amateur film. Had I known that from the get-go, I might not have bemoaned the loss of $1.99 because I would have had only myself to blame."
2,Boring/Bad acting,I didn't even get 10 minutes into this movie and was so bored by the cheap quality and rehearsed acting.
1,blast and whisper,this is a cheesy production! the picture quality looks like kids holding their parents outdated video camera. TOTAL WASTE OF TIME
5,Great,"Bosch bits are the same grade of quality as freud bits. The carbide tips can be sharpened with sand paper or a dremel tool many times before they are shot. Bits like these are great for making joints. Having the joint stepped is actually better than just a Tongue & Groove joint because there is more surface area to create friction, or to coat with glue if you wish. And it's a lot easier than dove tailing, which isn't any better than T&G; in my opinion anyway. Mortise and Tenon joints are the best, but also the most labor and tool intensive.Hope that helps."
4,Still want the movie!,"I read this when it first came out, and I thought someone would snatch up the movie rights because it is so cinematic. Sadly, it's been ten years and no one has. McDonald renders his world so visually in this book that you picture the scenes vividly while you read. The characters are quirky and fascinating, and the story is a lot of fun. This is a hidden gem that deserves to be more widely read."
1,Boring,"I couldn't get through this one. All the cult speak was nonsense. Also, a 40 page chapter describing a meeting of new cult members in a hotel is way too long."
5,Page Turner,"This is the second book continuing Tim Rackley's adventures after his involvement with the vigilantes who double crossed him and cost him his career with the US Marshal's office. This time he gets involved with a cult based outside of Los Angeles. I could not put this book down. I was happy that Rack could continue to heal after his daughter's murder by putting his energies into rescuing poor little Leah, who could not leave the cult on her own. Great book! I am now reading The Troubleshooter, which is the third book in the series and just as much a page turner as the first two books. I love Gregg Hurwitz books. Great, fast and exciting reads!"
2,"Okay, I finished it","Well I finished this story. A page-turner? Only because I'm stubborn and had paid good money for it, and wanted to get to the end. Near the very end, it finally got interesting, because THE ACTION FINALLY PICKED UP. Perhaps it's just me, be the rest was slow, slow, slow. I finished it, but I'll never read another of this series, or this author."
5,A Tribute,"Oh my God how this song touches my soul. I first heard it during the Gulf War, but this time around it fits so perfectly. It covers those who fought in the plane that crashed in Penn., it covers the firemen who went to their deaths at the WTC, it covers the rescue workers who labored day and night to try to find people at the Pentagon and WTC, it covers family members and friends who perished before their time because of insane terrorists bent on hate. ""Thank you, thank you, thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings."" Oh how so true and when she sang this at the NY Memorial Service, it was the most beautiful song of tribute song purely from the heart. God bless Bette, for inspiring her to create this song. Little did she know what it would do for so many."
1,Not as great as I thought,"I bought the DVD so that I could learn Chinese with my children. My children won't watch the DVD at all! I think that the characters speak too quickly and you have to use the book to follow along with the characters. It also bothers me that the characters don't move their lips because as a language learner, I read lips to see how words are formed. This DVD is not good for someone who doesn't know any Chinese."
2,"Poor pedagogy, worse animation","The video has a two major defects:1. Bad pedagogy--the new chinese words are presented to children in sentences, instead of word-by-word or in phrases. So a child hears long strings of sound (which I guess they are just supposed to memorize!) with few clues about what each word means--or even where one word ends and another begins.2. Poor animation (animation, of course, is always less effective than seeing a native speaker's mouth as you hear them pronounce--but the cartoons could have been used to capture children's attention: they don't.).We purchased this video at the same time as the first Learn Chinese with Jade! video and found that to be an excellent introduction."
2,awful songs,I am very disappointed after watching the first two scenes with my daughter. The songs are not helpful at all and are sung by people who don't know how to speak Chinese! The pronunciation in the songs is just awful. And the animation is of very low quality.
4,Fun and Learn,"With my eight year old son and infant daughter, I reviewed ""Mandarin Chinese Beginning Level 1"" presented by Language Tree. What amazes me the most is they make the language learning process entertaining, rather than the traditional way of ""pain"".Several songs throughout the video make the whole process fun! Literally, you can dance with the songs while you and your children are learning - that's what I did with my kids. The short sentences are easy to follow, and for every scene you get a quick review on what you just learned. The multiple story sessions are situations you bump into daily. It is amazing that all of the above is packed in just 30 minutes! I am waiting for Language Tree's next video to be produced.Martin Liu..."
5,Fleas begone!,"I bought this for my animals to use in conjunction with their other flea treatments. I had read somewhere that fleas don't like the taste of the blood when this is in the animal's system. Don't know if that is true or not, but I had to give it a try. Didn't have lots of fleas, but enough to be annoying.My adult cat and two dogs have these in their breakfast food each morning. One of the dogs and the cat eat them like treats, but the other dog doesn't care for them, so I just put them in the food. (1 tablet for every 10 lbs. of weight)I have not seen any fleas on my animals in over a week now and the scratching has pretty much stopped too.This is also supposed to be good for skin and coat. All of my animals have very nice coats and no skin problems."
1,Horrible product. Arm & Hammer needs to stop making this.,I purchased this at my local grocery store and it stinks. Literally. Does not cover the smell. There are many other brands out there that make your house smell better than if you didn't have a litter box at all.Accidentally purchased this product last week (in a rush) and I remembered that I had tried it a few months ago and it's horrible.Do yourself a favor and get FreshStep Multi Cat. It's far superior to this product.
1,Terrible litter,"I've been using this for a little while and it's the worst litter Arm & Hammer sells. It doesn't clump at all. I have to scoop out dark, urine-soaked litter that reeks of ammonia. It's really dusty, too."
3,"Sufficient clumping ability, but dusty and super strongly-scented","Cat litter is probably one of the things I hate most about having a cat. It is so hard to find one that has all of the qualities you need - scoop-ability, odor absorbency, non-offensive scent, doesn't track all over the house, etc. Unfortunately, while this is an ""adequate"" litter, it is so strongly scented that it gives my fiancé a headache when I change the boxes. The fresh litter also gives off a significant amount of dust as you pour, intensifying the perfume problem. Luckily, all of the fragrance manages to do a decent job of covering up urine odor, at least. This is not my favorite cat litter, but my cat prefers it over other types (newspaper pellets, crystals), so I will keep using it."
1,HORRIBLE!!,"This is the worst litter I've ever used. It did NOTHING for covering odors. Seriously, I've never used a litter before that couldn't even cover one day's worth of build-up. I actually ended up mixing in baking soda and powdered laundry detergent to help mask the smells. A way for Arm & Hammer to make more money? Don't waste your money on this. Use Fresh Step Multi-Cat instead."
3,Bodum Tea Press,"Plunger seal is a bad design. It will not hold up. After 2 months use,the plunger wants to keep moving up and will not stop brewing process.I think a back up seal should have been supplied with unit.You must also be very careful with this unit.It is fragile."
3,"Cool tea pot, but...",I love this tea pot. It looks great and it can stop the brewing process with the tea in it. But the down side to it is that it is very fragile. I lightly touched it against a bowl while removing it from the dish rack and it broke. I wish bodum makes another tea pot like this with metal reinforcement like the coffee pot they make.
2,Beautiful but broken,"Got this for Christmas, now it's Dec 26 and it's in shards. Beautiful on the shelf, but don't use it if you want to keep it in one piece. Or better yet, just don't buy this and admire it when you are in the shop...."
4,Teapot,"When I ordered this teapot, I thought I was ordering the same one that I had before, which was great until it broke. The wife hit it on the side of the sink when it slipped in her hand. Anyway, when I ordered this I thought it was going to be like the last one, as it turned out it was the smaller size one. When I opened the box I was a little disappointed. But as it turned out, it's a great little teapot. I just can't make as much tea as I could before. Don B."
1,Too fragile to ship,"I ordered this teapot, along with several Bodum glasses and two books, and, when the box arrived, the teapot was shattered into numerous small fragments. The teapot was not well cushioned inside the manufacturer's box, unlike Bodum's glasses. I reported the teapot as defective and Amazon replaced it promptly. Two days later, another teapot arrived, in its own box, and it was also broken, although in fewer, larger pieces. Amazon didn't put much packing wrap in the box, so it's difficult to tell whether the fault is Amazon's or the manufacturer's. In any case, Amazon won't send a third teapot, saying they need to contact the manufacturer about the problem.This teapot is pretty, but I'm not sure I would purchase it in a local store because of its extreme fragility, which is the only way I'm going to be able to get it."
1,"""original fit"" means one size smaller than you expect!","I ordered four of these jeans for my son, and had to send them all back (plus for S&H). Not good. My son needed 28x32 pants because when he tries on 30x32 pants, he swims in them. He's really skinny and tall (growing teenage boy) and he has narrow hips. It's tough to find 28x32 pants, so I was happy to see these jeans. But, he could not even get these jeans over his hips. When it says ""original fit"", be careful. Plus, the jeans are skin tight, especially across the waist / crotch area. A 28x32 of these jeans is really for a 26x32 person. So, order up one size. My son would have loved the jeans if they had actually fit him. Really good quality denim."
5,Fit great and comfortable,"Very sturdy, beat out Levi's in my opinion. I'll buy more in the future. Only drawback is in cold weather they dont feel as warm as Levi's, lucky I'm in the California Bay Area."
2,not stiched well,I like wranger jeans but these particlar pair where not stiched wellthe stitching in the crotch of the jeans came out after the second wash I wrote the vendor but they replied
2,Poor Fitting,"Like most of the old standards, Wrangler seems to have gone the same as Levi and other companies and manufacture in quantity rather than with quality....I've worn these jeans and Levi's for over 50 years and like so many products today, they aren't what they used to be...."
3,Good for the price,"This hitch pin was good for the price it was, but the lock did seem pretty loose, and the pin was about 2 inches too long for the hitch on my SUV. But like I said I am pleased with what I got for what I paid."
3,Decent Pin (If it fits),"This locking hitch pin seems to be secure once locked, but has several drawbacks.First, because it is longer than the average hitch pin (to accommodate the lock), it was very difficult to get it to fit on our Ford Explorer. We had to wiggle the lock in past the trailer electronics hookup (and a bolt), and eventually got it to connect. Normal hitch pins are no problem however, so most of this had to do with the odd length and layout of this locking pin. The weather cover will not go on at all, but in our case the bumper shields it from rain, so that works ok. Finally, once hooked on, the pin is a little bit loose, so it allows a small amount of wobble to whatever is connected.It will probably work well for its purpose, but I think I would research other options before settling on this one."
1,Battery eating PDA,"Palm IIIX can satisfy all your PDA needs at nearly no cost, and it is easy on batteries. Palm VIIX eats batteries for breakfast."
4,'Hex' was still the best...,"It's good and better than most of Earth's music. Hex is worth it, but you have to be a fan for most all of the other CD's, except this one 'squeaks-in' way under Hex and over the top of the rest."
2,Overrating,"I found this joke of a movie so degrading that if it weren't for the big stars, this movie wouldn't even be released in the lowest pits of hell. Also I think that the humour was that of a 3-year old and the type of comedy that was displayed was so simple-minded that a half-witted chipmunk would die of boredom. Once again, I belive that this movie is extremely overrated. Don't pay the price for this vomitisation."
1,it stunk big time,"In fact. thinking it over, it stunk even more than I originally said. Lloyd Bridges must be rolling over in his grave."
1,I hated this video! (I saw the video),"This video was pointless, and it wasn't even funny! My dad and I thought it was a waste of time and money to watch it. Mafia was disgusting and it didn't make sense, and I hope no one else will waste their time watching it."
3,"-Good movie, but very confusing plot-","This movie was good & funny at times, but at others I found myself having to rewind some parts to try to understand it a bit better. It's not the Mafia that I don't understand, I understand them and their ways of going about their business. For one, I couldn't understand if, when he meets the lady that later cheats w/ his brother, it was in the past or the present. I would recommend this movie, but it wouldn't have my highest blessing."
3,Were you expecting a masterpiece?,"Jay Mohr can be a very funny guy, but since he has to deadpan his role in ""Mafia,"" he can't really cut loose. Interesting that Leslie Nielsen, who's not a comedian at all, is so much better at these ""sight gag"" movies. I think it's because he looks so righteous and naive, he doesn't make you think he's above the joke. If you love these joke-every-second movies, you've already watched ""Mafia."" If not, this one's not essential. Of course, it's an improvement over the ""Hot Shots"" movies. My favorite bit was the goofy casino games they came up with!"
5,Endless Laughs!,"I think Mafia! was one of the greatest movies of all time! From the first scene to the last, I just didn't stop laughing! This has deffinitely made a spot on my all-time favorites list!"
4,Riverdance! Riverdance! Riverdance!,"Excellent movie! however, the only reason why I give it 4 stars istead of 5 is because like any of Jim Abraham's other movies, the humor in them tend to get a little dry every once in a while. Otherwise, this is an excellent movie! my favorite parody is the Riverdance one, I never thought a tap-dancing, 500 lbs white man would be so funny. Congratulations Mr. Abrahams!"
2,Sadly not as funny as it once was...could just be me,"I was so excited to get this movie since I remembering it being hilarious when it was first released. Despite my sophomoric sense of humor, this movie wasn't anywhere near what I remember and was at times cringe-inducing rather than funny. I actually shut it off twice and forwarded through a few parts. Off to the donation pile it goes, with a heavy heart..."
3,Bammer Mafia,"This movie is so silly...I wanted it so badly cause I didn't get to see it at the movies. Then when I saw it ..I was not pleased..It's a mix of Casino, the Godfather, and Goodfellas..Some parts are funny but it was too stupid for me to watch a second time.."
5,hahahahahahahaha,"when i saw this,i was on the floor laughing my a** off.when i saw the part where everybody in the casino dies,i said ""this movie is stupid! "".it was so stupid it was funny.i really like movies like this.there is a laugh in every minute of this movie.i can not believe it got 2 stars.i was expecting it to only get one,it was so funny and stupid"
4,Mafia!,"A hilarious comedy from the makers of Airplane and The Naked Gun. Anthony (Jay Mohr) is from an Italian family in the Mafia. It tells the story about how his father (Lloyd Bridges in his last film) came to America and started his family. Anthony marries Diane (Christina Applegate) and goes out on a mission to find out who killed his father. Often funny, and a little confusing at points. Anthony's disturbed brother Joey is quite silly, putting in stupid remarks and nearly getting his whole family killed numerous times. All in all, this spoof on The Godfather is very likeable and humorous."
3,Bashful's DVD Summary #004,"Best:1) The sight gags and verbal funnies come fast and furious.2) Many of the jokes are hilarious and will have you rolling.3) You get to see classic gangster actors spoofing themselves.Worst:1) Some of the stuff was REALLY dumb (as in not funnny dumb).2) Can you really have too many fart jokes? Yes.3) There are no special features on the disk.Recommendation:If you liked the ""Airplane"", ""Naked Gun"" and ""Hot Shots"" type of movies, then you should like this one too. I say get it due to it's high rewatch value."
3,"A little too slapstick, but still very ,very funny!","Mafia! was a hiarious movie, although there were a few parts were too digusting to be considered hysterical, such as a little boy being stuck up the anus of donkey. Even though in some movies, stupidity can be considered funny, some of the jokes just are too stupid even to giggle at. But there were some very funny parts, especially when... Well, I'm not going to give it away."
4,Lovely Piano Duets,"I love all sorts of jazz duets, this is no exception. Just lovely, dense music from 2 incredibly skilled pianists. Would love to see these guys live."
4,Awesome little pocket knife,The size of this knife makes it an ideal everyday carrying knife. I am impressed with how sharp the blade is on this knife. It is habit forming to play with. The thumb studs make it easy to open even for a left hander like me. The clip keeps it nice and secure as well as the locking feature.
5,"Strong, silent type","This is a great book, great criticism, beautifully written (charged with the same energy as her favourite writers). I read it non-stop. I would give it 6 stars if I could (one to go on her chest where the deputy sheriff's badge would go.).I confess I don't completely agree with aspects of the gender argument (that the western is essentially an anti-Victorian female activist genre), but I don't care. It is the best book about the West I have read since Ariel Dorfman's great essay on The Long Ranger."
2,More personal comment than literary criticism,"Ms. Tompkins makes many good points about Westerns and how they came to be, but she negates her best points with her personal agenda of modern attitudes and political correctness. She obviously appreciates Westerns, but she doesn't seem to really get them. If you are looking for a good book about Westerns try Peter A. French's COWBOY METAPHYSICS. He even discusses Ms. Tompkins key points so you can avoid reading her personal and political commentary which she blatantly weaves throughout the entire book."
5,Yee- Ha!,An interesting look at Westerns from personal and literary perspectives. Focuses attention on a rich genre that has not been looked at enough by the fields of literary criticism and literature.
3,"Tantalizing, but disappointing; the plot defies belief","The main characters are well realized and the scenes with Elizabeth and Joe are quite good, memorable, and do keep the book afloat. However, the plot is entirely unbelievable; it's as if London contains about 20 people--the figures in this book, all crossing paths, all knowing each other, all related in less than interesting ways. There is a sub-plot, which I could have done without; namely, mother and the vulgar rich American, of course, which did nothing to move the more interesting story along; that of Elizabeth and her past, dealing with her present and unknowable future. Also, a nit-picky thing: the volume I read contained too many typos and a couple of grammatical howlers. The book was that riveting that I noticed. I wait for the next and hope for better."
3,Nice cd.But could be better,"Cd where Daniela MErcury was considered ""FURACAO"". But,it could be better.It hasn't got many dancing music.And,even with the big hits like ""batuque"",""A verdade do Ile"",""Cotidiano"",and the great hit ""O canto da Cidade"",her most famous song,the cd tries to be more MPB than Axe music. After all,if she is ""Bahian FURACAO"",the cd MUST be Bahian."
2,There are much better options,"The centerpiece of this album -- the 1812 -- is shamelessly amateurish. Obviously recorded outdoors, it is played for effect rather than for musicality. The recording is third-rate, as is much of the playing: the trumpets are especially sloppy, with lots of intonation problems; the timpanist is a head-banger, trying to out-do the cannons; the conducting is a mystery. A lot of the tempi are to the extreme... for what effect... to be different? Different is clearly not always better. Don't be fooled by the marquee of players. The ""goods"" are gone missing."
3,bulova men's watch,satisfactory for an inexpensive watch. The diamonds are not very noticeable in person compared to the picture displayed online.
1,Ordered May 2005,"I just got another notice of a delay. Ordered this May 2005 and now estimated shipping is April 2006. Totally ridiculous. Why offer these if you can't deliver.UPDATE May 2, 2006- Just got off the phone w/ Amazon rep because I did not see my pending order for this item on my account screen. They cancelled it without telling me because ""we're probably not getting anymore"". I am very disappointed because they kept me waiting for 1 year on this purchase!UPDATE Sept 18,2006- Just called Amazon because I noticed this for sale by Amazon in ""Yellow"". It is listed for $124.99 plus free shipping. I explained my situation and referenced my past order number that was cancelled for $39.98 and 'Tony' at the Amazon 800 number honored my past order. Now I'll wait and see. Amazon customer service was efficient and polite. Thanks!"
1,Damaged Item received late,"I purchased this item several seasons ago for a Christmas gift. It arrived late. When I finally gave this item as a gift, the recipient discovered the crack inside. Amazon refused to do anything, because they said it was more than 30 days. Le Creuset is supposed to have a hundred year warranty, but that apparently only applies if you don't buy from Amazon"
4,Jim Reeves Memories,"Good video of Country Music stars from the early 60s era. Includes nice performance of ""Bimbo"" by Jim Reeves. Those of us who are Reeves fans would like to see more video of his performances but to be fair to anyone who produces a compilation of Classic Country there simply isn't much material available."
5,WOW,WOW! My son loves this and it has lasted him three weeks now. Great idea for low attention span 6 year boy! He can;t wait to build the dinosaur.
5,peaso disco,un disco q lo flipas de peña con mas años quel sol y mas marcha quel fabuloso fatboyslim
2,"Bachmann Passenger Car 85, Full Dome ATSF- N scale","This is a good looking model. The only problem I had with it concerns the tight curves I have on my layout. By reason of reduced space, I choose to go to N scale.I started with Bachmanns EZ Track system in a starter set. Alas, It seems that long cars over 60 scale feet will not operate as intended (for me). The long car will topple over on curves. If you have wider radius curves, then this is a good deal."
2,Not necessary,We purchased this but it is not exactly what we thought. It's okay but a knife works just as good.
2,very bleak.........,"Whle the crafting of this collection of short stories of life in Montana is skillfully done, the stories are very bleak. Mary Clearman Blew writes with an austerity that defies description. She is a skilled artist, painting a clear but bleak picture of life in the boondocks of Montana. The parallels of the lives of various women with the life of a female coyote was interesting, but the short story Sister Coyote was a depressing, hopeless tale that literally removes any breath of hope. While the stories were artfully rendered, this book was just to depressing for me."
4,great small LCD TV for the bedroom,"Ideally, I was looking for a small 23"" LCD HDTV for the bedroom, but was disappointed with the number of options available and moved up to 26"". Given the choices between Sony, Samsung, Toshiba, and Sharp units, I got a great deal on a Panasonic TC-26LX70 (33% off MSRP). Comcast is due for a significant HD channel upgrade in San Jose,CA so I'll reserve judgement about the complaint of only a couple of HD channels on Time/Warner (I currently receive 6 HD stations without the cable box). The Panasonic looks great with HD stations. SD color is a little less refined, but sharpness is quite good at typical viewing distances. Blacks and color suffers a little at large viewing angles. I would have loved the Sony Bravia, but wasn't willing to spend the extra $250 more for the privilege."
3,"pretty good, not as solid as Panasonic's plasmas","I have an early version Panasonic's plama set and am blown away by it's rich, detailed picture. So when I needed a smaller bedroom set I naturally went Panasonic, even though this was a flat screen LCD. It's pretty good but maybe I was spoiled by the picture on the plasma because it's just not as clear and sharp. Still recommended and a good set, just don't expect plasma performance."
1,A TV that requires a cable BOX,"I received my TV (Panasonci TC-32LX70 32"") 10 days ago. Since then, I am busy contacting Panasonic support, technicians and other personnel in an attempt to find out why my TV won't scan more than few channels off the cable connection (out of about 100 available).I tried to go through the channel scan a number of times (devoting almost one hour for each attempt)- to no avail. Still same few channels.After spending an hour or so trying to communicate this problem to Panasonic technical support, a technician came, but could not make the tv work.Could anyone reading this review advice me about what I can do?In the meantime my recommendation to those contemplating buying this TV is DO NOT BUY IT unless you are ready to use it only with a cable box ($6-$8 a month)."
1,"Panasonic 26"" LCD TC-26LX70 Poor Picture Quality","Just purchased this tv from Fry's. The setup issue was not that annoying however the picture quality is absolutely horrible. Granted the price was great, however my in store judging of comparable models was most likely skewed since all that was showing was a poor quality ""live"" rock concert. You never know in the store based on poor connections and people messing with them all day. I relied heavily on reviews from the internet which in most cases were good. Well, I'm telling you from my experience that the sound quality is not that good and the picture quality is very ""digitized"" looking and cannot handle sporting events at all. This set is going back ASAP and it's my last foray into the world of Panasonic. I'll stick with Sony."
5,Happy with flat panel Panasonic TV,We received the product quickly and in good condition. We are extremely happy with the TV.
2,Thomas the Tank Engine Colors,"This board book is fairly simplistic, and not the most interesting of all the Thomas books my children have. Using some of the engines at the station, basic color principles are shown. Bill and Ben are yellow, as are the rails of the bridge. James is red, as are the flowers in the flowerbox where he is stopped, etc. Unfortunately, there is little else to hold a child's interest once they've memorized that color and repeatedly pointed out the matching objects. There is no real text beyond the color written at the bottom of the page. All in all, not a very appealing Thomas book to budding and interested little minds."
1,cheap knockoff,"This is NOT the Milton Bradley product as advertised, but a sad, cheap knockoff. And to top it off, the monkeys are pink. VERY disappointed."
3,Doesn't Work for Caliper Slides,"This product, though labeled for use on caliper slides, just doesn't seem to do the job. For disc brake caliper slides I would look somewhere else."
5,Essential reading for all involved in helping groups work,"This excellent book provides a simple overview of the skills and tools needed when getting a group to work on a problem. Nothing is covered in depth, however I did not think that was the purpose. This books starts a learning process which people can take further if needed. The sytle is light and it has been written to maintain the readers interest. It adequately covers concepts, communication (questioning, body language, etc) and some simple tools with easy to understand examples. Most impressive was the straight forward treatment of writing a process map to identify and deal with problems."
2,You may want to consider a different product,"I just received these mineral & rock collections, and I cannot say that I'm impressed. I bought the ""Geosafari"" Mineral Collection ($16), Sedimentary Rock Collection ($16), Igneous Rock Collection ($16) and the Metamorphic Rock collection ($16). The inner trays are a flimsy plastic; not really suitable for displaying. In addition, the rock and mineral samples are soooo tiny, almost like pebbles. That was really disappointing. I would not recommend these for purchase. Amazon should consider finding a more complete selection presented in quality displays with samples that are at least 1 1/2"" to 2"" or larger. Thank you."
3,too much,"I think the Todd and Dana story was awful. The hole time was just so depressed and not having todd around made it so much harder, but I can't believe todd tried his hardest to not be around her. The Neil martin was a little much but it was ok. I have had enough with liz and sam fighting so much its starting to drive me crazy. The chloe thing was funny in the end but she tried too hard to be liked and that seemed to get her nowhere she was just liked even less. I think Liz and Todd should definatly get back together. I cant what yo read the next book to find out what happens with Chloe and Sam. I thought the book was a little too predictable. I think Francine just needs to think up a more suprizing ending to her books. The outcomes always end with someone getting hurt or the same person crying the whole time(Dana)."
3,Neil's running for office...,"Chloe always thought that college would mean a ton of friends. But instead she has hardly any. She could just go and live in the townhouse like her mother wants- and live the ""privledged"" life. She wants so much to get into Thetas, but why are they making so hard? Todd is in love with Dana, but living together isn't all he thought it would be....is this the end of them? Elizabeth is getting to close to Sam....and Sam has to push her away. This book is mostly about Neil's run for office on campus and the troubles he has with it after the word gets around campus that he is out of the closet. Can Jess, the campaign manager, fix it?"
2,TOTALLT BORING!,I'd just like to say that this book is not lik ethe others it is boring and so predictbale. i am ahuge fam of SVU and couldn't wait to read the next book the only intersting bits were Todd and Dana's and that makes me want to read on but could they please stop this Neil Martin rubbish about being Gay it is ridiculos and this fighting with Sanm has been going on in the last three books I must admit that The chloe scenario was funny but I am disappointed hope the other books to come are better
4,RP3200,"This product works great, I have used on items as small as balls up to car tires and it was astounding how well it performed."
4,for emergency use,"havent used it yet hopefully when i need it ,it will work good . seems to be built very good"
2,Inflatoe and worklight,"At the beginning it worked, then suddenly it stopped. I don't have the box anymore and adress to send it back. That is the reason that I did not like the product"
2,"Seems to work, but a little loud",I haven't had an opportunity to try the device yet. THe pump works and the light works. It is very loud though and pretty flimsy looking case.
2,short life,"""Please""do not waste your money.I have purchased (2) of these RP3200 in the pass year they work very good for a short time .but then they don""t work at all!"
4,Let the air flow,Works greatMay not fill as fast as some more powerful and expensive ones but does the job werateFound the gauge to be fairly accurate
4,"Powerful, rugged, handy, but small accessory compartment","This machine is a BEAST. It's so powerful that it bounces around wildly on the ground while inflating my bicycle tires. It has a dial that allows you to set it to automatically shut off after inflating a tire to a certain PSI. It has a heavy-duty on/off switch and flashlight switch, too. The whole thing is heavy-duty.My only complaint is that the compartment in the rear of the device for the cord and accessories is way too small to hold them. Every time I try packing the cord back into the compartment, I give up after five minutes and throw the whole thing into the trunk of my car."
5,Cordless inflater,First item did not work properly. Satisfactory replacement received very quickly. This is a prime vendor to deal with.
1,Useless Inflator,"This so-called inflator is a waste of money. I unfortunately did not test the thing until it was too late to return it. This item is noisy, barely produces a puff of air, and amounts to a poor quality $22.00 flashlight. The unit I received could not, even after 10 minutes of noise, inflate a small pool toy."
1,Bad Inflator,Twice of use and already this defective one so that the needle as crazy and does not work. I do not recommend it. What I do with this?
1,Defective unit,"Besides the fact that the product was defective, I would have wanted to know that the only power source for this unit is by plugging into your car. Instructions were useless."
2,Worklight ?,"I tried to blow up a huge mining dump truck tire with this thing, it took me 2 weeks to do it. Very slow. I even left it on during the night."
2,Not what described.,"The description of this product is not accurate. It is states that ""One 12-volt, 300 psi inflator with worklight that's ideal for roadside emergencies"" and I hoped to get 300 psi inflator. In reality it is 150 psi inflator."
4,Never travel without it.,"My previous inflator, another brand, which I had for 10 years finally bit the bullet. I ordered this and love the way it shuts itself off when the proper tire pressure is reached. At first I thought it was broken but I had the dial set improperly, it works great. I would never travel without one of these. Makes it easy to keep your tire pressure set without hunting down a service station that has a working tire inflator."
1,Had to return item,"Wish I would have paid more attention to reviews. Once I attached inflator to the tire valve, almost pulled out the valve trying to get the inflator off.Looks like it could be a good product if this issue were fixed. Purchased a Slime inflator and can easily attach and detach from valve.I expected better from Campbell Hausfeld."
1,Bogus rating!,The details given in the product listing claim 300psi output...the product user guide that came with the product specs only 140psi! Watch out!
2,"Well made, NOT","It worked great for the price for a short time, but soon stopped working. I only used it a few times to maintain the tire pressure on my pickup, no heavy use. Amazon's return policy was flawless though!"
2,Weak,"Works okay, but delivers very weak pulses of air. It takes forever to pump up pool toys; I wouldn't even attempt to pump my truck tires."
1,Not powerful enough for an air mattress,"Got this in hopes that it would inflate our air mattress we use while camping. We've used a four D-cell battery pump in the past to get it somewhat inflated, then lung power for the rest. Wanted to get further along the process before going to lungs, with a more reliable power source. Unfortunately, this product wouldn't inflate the mattress at all. It was not powerful enough to push through the one way valve."
2,Broken after after not so many uses,Worked ok for about 20 times. Now it stopped working. I would love it to be replaced. Anyone know how? It was very noisy and jumped around. I would prefer on that plugs into the wall and not into the car cigarette lighter.
1,Doesn't work,I purchased this item for its small size to carry in the car. The second time i used it it broke. Both times i was using it to fill a lawnmower tire. The tires max air pressure was only 10 pounds. Its a nice concept but if you want something to last its probably best to purchase a compressor a bit more substantial.
4,I like it,i use it for my 2011 kia sorento its almost 1 year now. no problem with it its not that stylish but it will do the job
2,Was never able to make it work,"I got the compressor and decided to give it a try before I put it in my trunk. I turned on the car engine to make sure there is enough power, connected the 12V plug and first tested the flashlight feature, works great. I then went and connected the compressor to one of my tires. First thing I noticed was that the reading on the compressor was off, it showed 28 psi on a tire for which a simple pressure gauge showed 36. Not a big deal I guess, it's a compressor not a gauge. The real problem was that the compressor never worked, turned it on and off a few times, played with the shut-off knob, but nothing complete silence. This unit is heading back to Amazon...maybe it's great when it works.On another note, the unit has a compartment for the power and air cables. It's extremely tight and pretty much once you take those cables out and stretch them it's almost impossible to get them back in there, would make sense to make the unit a bit bigger for easier storage."
4,Get the job done.,"Gets the job done, however is noisy and only works with 9 Volt cigarette lighter and takes a few minutes to fill the tire with air. For its price, no complaint. Has no carrying bag either."
4,Good value for price,"I bought this item to replace an old Interdynamics compressor that finally stopped working. The Campbell compressor inflates tires pretty quickly and is easy to use. However, a couple of warnings:1. You will have to fiddle around to get the inflation cut-off point right. I had to set it to about 40 p.s.i. to get 32 p.s.i. to remain in the tires. The air chuck makes a very tight connection to the valve stem and you lose at least 5 p.s.i. while removing it.2. The little compartment for the air hose and power cord is useless: You'll never get both back in there without a lot of work. I use it only for the air hose and just wrap the power cord around the unit.3. The unit is noisy and vibrates quite a bit. It was dancing around my concrete garage floor so much that I just hold it in my hand while it's working."
4,It inflates and does it fairly well,This equipment met my expectations. It is worth the money you pay for it. The automatic shut off feature is simple to use and works fine. It inflates fairly quickly too. Faster than few inflators which I have used before. I recently used it to fully inflate a totally flat tire. It took only about 4 minutes. I recently bought another unit for my wife from amazon.
5,Great buy!,I like this product because I don't have to worry about a certain amount of air pressure when inflating tires. I just select the amount of air and it stops automatically when it reaches the set amount.
1,Not a good product,"I had this unit for just over a month and only used a couple times with no problems. Then recently tried to inflate a bike tire, which it is capable of doing, and when connected to valve stem it stops. Runs when disconnected from stem so something shutting it done when trying to put air in a tire. No good and very frustrating for a new product that recieved such good review. Two thumbs down."
1,Defective Chinese POS,"The reason a person buys a product like this is to have the ability to pull it out of your trunk when you see a low tire and inflate it. The third time I tried to use it, it failed. I tested it on different cars, to see if it was a problem with the car's electrical power. It wasn't. I tried it on differenet tires with different valve-stems --- still wouldn't work.AMAZON should not be selling CRAP like this and then after 30 days sticking customers with a defect / non-functioning product."
1,Piece of Chinese made junk,"I should have known better, but I purchased this with points so that we'd have an inexpensive, portable inflator. After using it only 3 times over a month and a half, the compressor no longer works. I used it twice to pump up a car tire, and my wife used it to pump two bicycle tires. It worked fine on the first but died on the second. The light still works but no compressor. Why can't anything last? Very disappointed."
5,So far so good. Everything is OK with this Inflator,"So far so good. Everything is OK with this Inflator. Work as it should. I like it. Amazon forced me to write longer review, but I I do not have what to say more. Good is good, no problems."
2,It Tried to Eat My Fingers,"This seems to be a decent product with one huge exception. Removing the hose from the tire after inflating it is near impossible. Being determined, I pulled and wiggled and pulled some more as more and more of the just pumped air escaped and the skin on my fingers nearly shredded. I thought I could outsmart it and got some pliers and pulled it off and squirted some teflon spray on the rubber seal thinking next time it would surely slide right off with a reasonable tug but, no, it still can't be removed without the pliers which I'm afraid will squeeze and damage the hose end after a few uses. Does anyone know if it's possible to get a higher quality hose replacement or do I have to return this thing and start the hunt all over?"
4,Worked good,Took a little while but did a good job. Was a little tedious putting it all back together but it worked.
4,Limit Switch a Pleasant Surprise,"This inflator is quite convenient, except for the fact that the coupling to the valve stem does not come off easily, losing air in the process. I did not see a product spec. that identified the red ""circle"" on the inflator as a pressure gauge AND a limit switch, allowing the user to set the desired pressure and walk away, and not have to use a manual pressure gauge to check the tire pressure. This is a feature that I was surprised to find, and pleasantly so."
3,"Works well, a little shakey, short cord","I wish the cord were a LOT longer on this item, so it could reach around the car better, or from car to car. Will try to find a lighter extension cord..."
1,6 months later,"6 months later and this can't even generate enough pressure to inflate a soccer ball, let alone car tires. Don't waste your money. Spend a little more and get a decent inflator."
3,worked well...until it died,This was a very useful tire inflator - great price and very handy - until it stopped working a few months after we purchased it.
3,Worked as expected,After reviewing several inflators I decided on this one based on other reviews. It does vibrate some but did not pose a problem. I do like the clip on nozzle and had no difficulty removing it for a tire. It does inflate a raft fairly quickly. I only plan to use it for beach rafts on occasion and the check tire pressure. So it seems to be a good buy and will wait to see how well it holds up.
3,"Good pump, Dont Know if Nozzle Will Last","for the money, its a good product. only issue is that the nozzle that you attach to the tire valve stem has soft rubber lining the inside and the threads on my car's valve stem seem to cut into it every time I remove it. I suspect eventually the rubber will be gone and it will no longer seal on the valve stem."
3,Works well but hard to disconnect from valve,Bought this to replace a 20 year old Goodwrench one that finally died. It works well for a small portable inflator. Takes several minutes to inflate car tire to correct pressure from nearly flat and it also moves all over while inflating. The biggest issue I have had is that it is extremely difficult to disconnect it from the tire valve once the tire is inflated. I actually shaved some of the rubber off of the connection on the inflator to make it easier. I have not had it long enough to comment on durability.
2,Can't handle high pressure,"Item description say up to 120 psi pressure. Unit shuts off if i put my thumb over it while it's on after around 35 psi. I put it in my tire with a pressure of 40psi and it shuts off. This unless you're using for standard 32-35 psi car tires, it's useless. I have aftermarket all terrain tires that requires 40 psi and this unit can't handle it."
3,Peter's personal life trumps the silly villains.,"I really enjoy this era of Spider-Man but I could see how many would not. This collection focuses more on character development and personal interactions rather than fight scenes and cool villains. At times it almost resembles storyboards for some 1970s New York sitcom. You really get a feel of that gritty, filthy NY and it's inhabitants of the 70s, and there's a ton of comedy.I was never really quite sure how I felt about Ross Andru illustrating Spider-Man, but with any new artist to the comic it can take time to get comfortable with the character, and with the type of sitcom-like Peter Parker stories in this collection Andru really shines at making it his own.It's good that the character development works well in this collection because the majority of the action is pretty silly and many of the villains are just downright stupid. The Ghost of Hammerhead was a tough one to get through without rolling my eyes."
2,What a study of decay,The loss of Lee/Romita (Sr) was quite apparent and noticable when the team of Conway/Andre took over and completely butchered the series. Conway's writing is yet to be developed and Ross Andre didn't quite have a style worth mentioning. He partly attempted to be a John Romita (Sr) light and came up dry. The story lines are more noteworthy. Conway killed off Gwen and explored the post Gwen era with some success. The cloning of Gwen was an interesting take but the entire Doc Ock Hammerhead idea was painfully pointless. This of course was post silverage and Marvel looked at sales over substances (Spidy sold well despite the crappy material) and didn't see the need to improve the series. Len Wein took over from Conway and improved the story line but Andre kept on. Oh what a Jim Sterako or a Steve Ditko could have done to improve the series. Sadly the Lee/Ditko/Romita/Kane magic was long gone.
1,"Started at 785 on amazon, now its at over 900 USD","just wanted to let anyone who wants to buy this watch know that the price of this watch was around th 780 mark a month or so back and since then its skyrocketed to 900 plus. If you want to buy this watch, wait for a while till the price comes down to its original or go for another brand and/or model."
1,NO Bulbs....,"Well, I'd like to be able to review this kit but I can not use it! There are no bulbs/lamps in the kit. Adorama is NOT helpful. It 'appears' that the buld only costs $3.65. However, neither Amazon nor Adorama's websites show a 'fit'. The floodlight states that only compatible bulbs should be used.More once I can use this product."
4,Useful,"I bought this book mainly for the annotations of the books and, for me, the theory and application to classroom situations is a bonus. The part I will use the most is the annotation section, where the book is discussed and pointers are given on what types of issues are addressed. Discussion points, always useful for teachers, are carefully addressed for each book. I wish more books could have been included, but, of course, there are trade-offs in that - longer ==> more expensive."
5,If You Only Buy One Book About The Gifted Child....,"....It should be this one.What a wonderful find! This is the road map for everything regarding the intellectually gifted child. Guiding the parent or teacher through both the heart and mind of the gifted child.I was one of the parents in the book who always felt my gifted son was missing out on something by spending time alone, or playing alone at school. I would very much encourage him to spend more time with friends, make new friends, invite friends over. Now I have a much better understanding on why he needs so much ""alone"" or ""down time"".I definite must for parents of gifted children age Preschool to High School! Although it even helped me figure out my gifted husband!"
3,Good guide but too much focus on 'darker' titles,"THis book has been helpful to point one in the direction of some useful books for gifted readers, but again I find so many of our youngsters are encouraged to read the 'darker', evil and witches and wizards type stuff that is spewed out at every turn. Some more classical and humourous childrens novels would be better. DOnt we see that teen suiside and childhood depression is on the increase? Wake up world, children need light not darkness in their reading!"
5,Amazing!,"This band is a hidden gem! they are really really talented, you seriously wont be dissapionted!!Just listen to it, or check out there MySpace, there really really good!!!!Love em!"
5,Beautiful book,"The photos in the book are beautiful and enhance the humor throughout. The number of people who have picked this book off my coffee table and simply haven't been able to put it down until they have been cover to cover and then gone back to choose their favorite photos/captions. It oozes with fun, warmth and captures some of the magic of these wondrous critters. There are a number of books available on the care & maintenance of llamas but this book shows an insight of the joy of owning llamas. If you want to get people hooked on lamas give them a copy of this book."
5,Your Music Brings Me to Paradise,"""Another Day In Paradise"" is a very touching song and I remember listening to it on the local radio station during my teenage years. It is still one of my all time favourite English songs.Thanks uncle Phil for the memories."
4,Not the best shape for baking,"The pepper casserole is very cute, but I prefer the wider, shallower shape of the pumpkin casserole which I also own. The small, deep pepper tends to cook some dishes unevenly due to the shape. For instance, I used this casserole to bake egg custard. At the end of the recommended cooking time the middle remained liquid. By the time the center was firm, the edges were dry & overcooked. This same dish cooks perfectly in the pumpkin. I find that I use the pumpkin far more frequently due to the superior baking results I've achieved with it."
5,A perfect shape for the long hot simmer...,"Even though I purchased both the Le Creuset pumpkin and the tomato pots at the same time -- and they are wonderful and cute as well -- this is the one I go to first for most simmering recipes.Because the bell pepper pot is slightly narrower at the bottom and the sides are taller, the shape is perfect for jambalaya where the meats bake in a nest of rice and veggies -- they steam just right without burning or drying out. Also a great little pot for sauerbraten for 2.The seal is tight, the heat distributes perfectly, and the surface cleans up in a snap. Equally easy to use in the oven or on the stove.And if a pot can have a personality, this one does."
5,The other side of Israel,"We are not surprised to find out that Israel has its own secret agency. MOst countries in the world have the own national agencies and in the case of Jewish people, having a highly effective secret service is paramopunt for their survival. 6 millions Jews perished during the Holoucast and this can never be allowed to happen to any race .The books reveals that after centuries of oppression against the Jews, they( Jews) have taken matter into their own hands. This books shows how this agency( MOSSAD) despite being rather young in the spy business, have estableished themselves as a premier Spy agency in the world. It is also frightening to know that some of them have acquired the charcateristics of their enemies.This excellent book also shows how a common man can be convert into an important tool for the agency."
3,Look at this book as a novel,"If you look at this nook as being merely a novel, rather than the purported true story it is claimed to be, you will find it much more enjoyable. For me there are just far too many incredible fantasies depicted by Mr. Ostrovsky, for this book to ring true. I suppose elements of it are, as is the case with many good novels.Therefore, as a novel, I give this book 3 stars. If I reviewed it as a work of non-fiction, I would have given it the lowest rating possible (1 star), because it is simply unbelievable."
4,Not as strong as 'By Way of Deception',"This is a very worthwhile read but not as fulfilling as the original blockbuster 'By Way of Deception.'The ending is pretty weak, we are supposed to believe that Victors (book author) old friend send a kidon (Mossad assassins) group to 'take care' of Victor. It is also my opinion that the author over stretched when he vouched that Bush Sr had nothing to do with the Iran-Contra affair. Read 'Compromised' for a believable account of the involvement of many 'well placed' individuals in the Iran-Contra affair. Nevertheless, I find most of the book to present itself as being fairly credible.More thrilling stories of almost impossible levels of Mossad skulduggery. I'm sure most readers will find themselves very thankful for the fact that the Mossad is, mostly, thousands of miles away.The Mossad is simply too important to not get educated about. This is another good insider account by Victor Ostrovsky."
4,Very REAL...SCARY...TOUCHING.....SHOCKING........,"I have read many books on espionage regarding Mossad, MI 5, FBI & Mr Ostrovosky is very courageous to come forward to ""inform"" everyone of the truth. Unfortunately, I have not been able to obtain his first book - By Way of Deception. I felt a real sense of danger when he has to travel to Jordan & Egpyt.., I am sure he still ""dream"" about those operations. Struggling to live a normal life after leaving Mossad can be difficult and besides telling us the details of many operations, he also describe his emotions,feelings & aspirations - all of which helped to sustain him and you can't help but feel that he too like everyone else deserve a second chance in life."
3,"Avoid it if you like ""family films""","Blandness prevailed in this sequel without the sharp creative edge of John Hughes writing it. No nudity, swearing and a silly grade school pun about the Hoover Dam. In fact, climbing the Hoover Dam was one of the funniest scenes in the film (even if people could guess it was made with a cardboard cutout backdrop) and the plane scene resembled model seats in a room someplace instead of inside a plane. Ellen singing ""Loving You"" with Wayne Newton also grabbed some laughs. But it was funny in a sitcom and morality sort of way instead of the satire National Lampoon made famous in the three previous films."
3,Entertaining. Would make a great inflight movie.,"I thought this one was inferior to NL's Vacation, certainly a lot better than European Vacation, and I haven't seen Christmas Vacation so I can't compare it.I found this movie to be quite entertaining. Chevy Chase is funny as the idiot father, Randy Quaid is hilarious as the Jethro-inspired redneck cousin from the original Vacation movie, and it is great seeing Wayne Newton making fun of himself. My only real complaint with this movie is that it spends a lot of time pointing out the dangers of gambling, and then they rely on gambling to save the day."
1,DVD was not good,"I was expecting to see the movie instead I had a bad dvd ,maybe I`ll try to get it again someday"
1,DON'T WATCH IT!,"THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE DUMBEST I'VE SEEN YET. MY SISTER AND I HAVE SEEN IT SO MANY TIMES (IT'S BEEN ON HBO EVERYDAY) THAT WE CAN PUT THE TV ON MUTE AND RECITE THE WORDS. IT IS TORTURE. IF IT COMES ON YOUR TV, PLEASE PUSH POWER, OR YOU'LL SUFFER!"
4,"One of the better of the ""National Lampoon"" series","A great synopsis of what a typical vacation in Las Vegas is like. Believe me, situations all too similar to what the Griswold family experience in this film are quite common; except for Rusty winning all those cars! If you are planning to take a trip to Vegas or any other gambling mecca, this should show you what to expect and hopefully, how to avoid it!"
4,The movie that will keep you laughing.,This is a GOOD movie. My boyfriend just dies laughing everytime he sees it. This is a movie for all days of the year.
2,vegas vacation,"I do not know which of my family members chose this, but it is not the type of show I would spend my time watching."
3,It was funny,My husband watched this...enjoyed it and rated ot a 3. It was a fun movie to watch!! Not a blockbuster :)
5,Chevy on Vacation Again....,Chevy Chase does it again...I have seen this movie many times and it is pretty entertaining! He is such a crazy guy and has a way of keeping you wondering - what next?????
1,Vegas Vacation (Full Screen Edition),The product was suppose to me new but the movie including the case was slimy and nasty. This product was not even close to new and watched it once and now it doesn't work because all it does is skip. I am very disappointed.
2,ALL BETS ARE OFF,"The ""Vacation"" franchise has had some hits and some misses, and this one falls into the latter categories. The Griswolds go off on a vacation in Las Vegas, and what happens there is so minimal it's a wonder why they even bothered to make a movie. Chevy Chase seems tired and weary as Clark, this time finding himself becoming a gambling addict particularly at the mercy of the blackjack dealer, a whimsical Wallace Shawn. Meanwhile, wife Beverly D'Angelo finds herself a wannabe companion for a quietly lecherous Wayne Newton and the kids go off in their own directions, the son becoming somewhat of a mini-Mafia man and daughter a caged dancer. Randy Quaid returns as redneck cousin Eddie, who has become so predictable his character is merely a caricature of himself. The movie struggles for its few laughs and is far beneath the manic silliness of the earlier Lampoon vacations."
2,Doesn't live up to the original.,This movie didn't live up to its predecessers. There were some funny moments though. The dam was good. Randy Quaid's performance was better than Chevy Chase's performance. Rated PG
1,"Even though it's free to Prime, don't waste your time","It may be free, but how much is 90 minutes of your life worth, because that's what it costs you. You can read the synopsis provided by other reviewers, but the bottom line is: the situations are stupid and predictable and totally not funny. The Hoover Dam sequence is the worst of the bunch and really stupid, what were they thinking when they came up with this? You can see each set-up coming and the ""punch line"" is stupid. All the premises of the side stories each family member gets into is lame and yes, stupid. Oh, did I say stupid? Well, I guess it was me, because I was stupid to watch this movie all the way to the end."
3,Vegas Vacation,"I just bought this DVD because my Fiancee Sharon, is a paramedic in the Syd Ceasar scene."
1,why did they make this movie?,"For money, that's why. This film is sooo boring and unfunny...Chevy Chase is too old to do comedy anymore and so is Randy Quaid...the two of them just slosh around and say unfunny one-liners...Chevy Chase doesn't even try to be funny, and when Randy tries to be, it's just awkward and forced. Please don't waste you're time and money on this garbage. P.S. it comes on TV like everyday but still don't watch it!"
1,ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN,I have no idea what anyone who gave this thing 4 or 5 stars was watching. It is so unbelievably bad. So bad that I can't even fathom that anyone on earth found anything redeemable in this movie. Seriously - someone tell me how this piece of poo could get 4 stars! Can you list some other movies you all gave 4 stars? Operation Dumbo Drop? From Justin to Kelly? Garbage!
3,"3 Stars For ""Vegas""","I have never really been a big Chevy Chase fan, however I accidentally stumbled upon this movie when it aired on tv and enjoyed it so much that I bought it on DVD. Chevy Chase is moderately funny in this movie, however at times his humor can be a little predictable and annoying. But it's the other characters in the movie that made it more memorable. Randy Quaid had a small part in this movie and was probably the most comical and entertaining of all the characters."
4,Great comedy,"If you've been to Vegas you'll find this excellent, if not it's still a funny movie and will make you want to visit. Chevy Chase is still good as Clark Griswold and Beverly D'Angelo great as Ellen. Loads of good Vegas stuff and cameos from Wayne Newton, Sid Caesar and Siegfried & Roy. If you enjoyed the other Vacation movies check this out."
5,Very entertaining,"You really can't go wrong with any of the Chevy Chase National Lampoon movies. This was such a great movie, we had to buy it for ""anytime watching"""
4,Chevy still has it,"Don't listen to anything anyone else tells you--Chevy Chase still has it after all these years. He is a great physical comedian, and he still delivers successfully, even in the last of the REAL National Lampoon Vacation films. Remember that the real running joke in the Griswold family films was that the kids were always played by different actors and their ages were never really established, nor did they ever really age."
3,"NOT GREAT,BUT WORTH BUYING",THIS FILM IS PRETTY FUNNY AND VERY FUN TO WATCH. DON'T ISTEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE THIS FILM NEGATIVE REVIEWS.
2,Forget this,"Not funny in any way, shape, or form. It is pitifully awful. I can't believe this movie was ever released."
2,Not so funny,Story line is not very interesting or funny. Chevy Chase is his usual self but not as funny as he gets older.
4,Good movie night,"The whole crew brought some much needed laughs! Makes a person realize how crazy life can get when the ""Vacation"" crew is on!"
5,love chevy chase,quality was good. I've loved this movie for a long time. Only issue was the way amazon instant video changes the format on my tv. Don't know why...
4,Another Great One For Chevy and Beverly,I can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie. I hope Chevy and Beverly continue and make another. Lot's of great laughs. Not their best but it's still a great family movie. Love the Dam scene. Lot's of Dam laughs.
4,Worth Having in the Collection,"All in all a great movie. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because The first two in the series are my favorite (especially Christmas Vacation). I've seen it more times than I remember, but still felt the need to add it to my collection."
5,Vegas Vacation,"The last of The National Lampoon's movies. Not as good as the others, but still enjoyable. Different kids again."
3,This is my dam review!,"Either the film makers are getting tired of the ""Vacation"" movies, or the writers. This movie is on par with the other ""Vacation"" movies, but barely. It does have ""Holiday Road"" which hasn't been heard since the first one.The Griswolds go to Las Vegas this time. They see the Hoover Dam (""Take all the dam pictures you want"") and Clark loses all his money with gambling. Rusty gets lucky and wins 4 cars. Wayne Newton woos Hellen, but fails.Let's hope the next ""Vacation"" movie is better."
4,Not Too Bad,"yes, Chevy chase is getting old, and yes this wasn't as good as the other three, but on it's own, It is HILARIOUS! Watching clark Lose all his money is Very funny, especially with the Dealer(Wallace Shawn. that guy was a riot, And rusty getting the Fake I.D. and winning 4 cars was funny as well. The ""Alone Day"" sequence had me rolling on the floor, especially at the end where Clark says he can do a lot of stuff on his own in Las Vegas, and then promplty turns his pockets inside out. if you are a fan of the Vacation series, watch it. If you Love Las Vegas, watch it. you won't be dissapointed"
3,"Funny, amusing, though doesn't live up to it's hype.","I am a fan of The Vacation Series. Though I didn't like European that much. Vegas Vacation is funny and amusing. Though it's getting a little old. Chevy Chase just doesn't have that zing anymore, though he is still funny. This is just a small comedy to end the series. Rand Quaid surely brightens up the scene and is almost the only comedy relief in the film. Quaid does his best job out of the Vacation series in this one. Quaid does steal the screen."
2,They should have made a PG-13 film instead!!!!,"This is one of the most disappointing sequels ever made. I love the first 3 vacation films, but this ""Vegas Vacation"" feels more like a made for TV movie. Unlike the other films in the series there are no raunchy jokes and rarely any REALY funny parts. Eddie and Rusty are the best charcters here. Apparently, Chevy Chase has really lost his mojo since 1989. I can't remember any thing he has done in the 1990s or since that has made me laugh. In Vegas Vacation its just it seems like he is going through the motions with no real comical chemistry at all. True, to his credit the script is definetly inferior to the other vacations. If they ever make another Vacation Film like in Hawaii or what-not I hope the writer doesn't forget write in some good jokes and use some ""4"" letter words too. Those crude jokes made the earlier movies REALLY FUNNY!Verdict: This PG Vacation is virtually unfunny and too tame compared to the other 3 vacations......."
3,Average Movie from an above average series.,"Not nearly as good as the first 3 vacation movies, but still worth watching for Griswold fans. A lot of the same jokes for the 3rd or 4th time around, a few new ones. The Hoover Dam scene is probably my favorite part. I found all of the Vacation movies (except Christmas Vacation) at Walmart in the $5 bin the other day and picked them up. I even picked up Christmas Vacation 2, which is actually quite a bit worse than this one. These movies were great 20 years ago, not hearly as good now, but still worth passing on to newer generations."
2,dud,"this fourth installment in the vacation series is close to abysmal inmy opinion.it's cheap gimmickry at it lowest.the first three in theseries were all very good,pretty much at the same level of quality ofjokes and story.this one was neither funny nor clever.the only goodthing about the the whole travesty is Wallace Shawn who has a smallrole as a black jack dealer.his bit is quite funny.but that'sit.otherwise it's sheer tedium.it's worth noting that the words""national lampoon"" do not appear before the title,so maybe that sayssomething right there.anyway,if i had known how bad this thing was,iwould have booked myself self an appointment for a sinus scrapinginstead.it would have been more enjoyable.i'll give it 2/5 only becauseof Wallace Shawn"
3,"Funny, but it doesn't have that hilarious '80s formula","'Vegas Vacation'- a movie made 8 years after the 3rd National Lampoon's ""Vacation""(Christmas Vacation, 1989) just does NOT have that funny, original, and stupid '80s humor that the other 3 are filled with. Although it is funny when Ellen falls for Wain Newton, and when Clark goes to Hoover Dam with the rest of the family, AND when Rusty (their son) wins 4 cars,- it just can't beat those hilariously laugh-making 'Vacation' films that appeared in theatres about.. what?- 15 YEARS AGO?! I mean, if you are going to make a 4th one, make it a little better,...'cause people need it to be pretty darn good if you make a 4th 'Vacation'. Starring: Chevy Chase (as usual), Beverly D'Angelo, and Randy Quaid. I give it a B. Check out my other reviews for: 'National Lampoon's Vacation', 'The Family Man', 'Romy and Michelle's Highschool Reunion', 'CON AIR', 'Finding Forrester', 'SCREAM 3', and many many more!"
3,The original formula was tampered with,"Let's face it, what made the 'Vacation' movies funny was Clark Griswold's over the top 'family togetherness'. In this film however he actually encourages the family to 'do their own thing', something unheard of in the the former three films. The only real 'Vacation' type humor is at Hoover dam, where Clark gets into his bizarre and unbelieveable mischief.Randy Quaid again literaly steals the show as cousin Eddie. Highlights of the film are Beverly D'Angelo's outfits (she's still one hot momma), the casino of kid's games, and Sid Caesar's 'winning heart attack'. Not a bad movie and good for a few laughs, but not near the quality of the first three."
4,"Not as Great as the first three, but still worth seeing!","I loved this movie because after going to Vegas and the Hoover Dam, the Griswolds' experiences really brought back some memories. The only problem was the Chevy Chase is just plain annoying in this one (the Dam scene was one part... even a Griswold isn't stupid enough to do THAT!) I've always thought that Randy Quaid character was more disgusting than amusing. BUT, the person that made the whole movie pay off was Ethan Embry as Rusty, aka Nick Poppagiorgio from Yuma. His priceless ""duh?"" expressions had my husband and I cracking up through the whole movie. Best Rusty of the four, for sure."
2,Not a jackpot!,"Vegas Vacation is the last of the franchise and probably the second worst. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo look completely bored in this one, glad they didn't make another Vacation after this box-office flop. Randy Quaid reprises his role as the annoying and vile Eddie. The whole Vegas premise seemed like a good idea but to my chagrin this film isn't priceless."
4,Vegas Vacation,"I loved this movie! It was very funny, and entertaining. Ethan Embry was also a cutie! You also got to see lots of Vegas, which was exciting! This must be the best Vacation film yet!"
2,Video Review,This is very outdated! I do not recommend it for training purposes. It does not cover the history and current changes. I used it for a College class and was very dissapointed. Need to find a new video on history to date.
1,Meh...,I heard Crabs in the Bucket and one or two others of K-os and expected more quality on a collected CD. All in all I only ended up liking the Crabs in the Bucket song. A little disappointing after some of what I've seen on TV from interviews and such.
3,Braun Cordless Curling Iron,"I actually like this product very much. It has always worked well for me. Switching it on is kind of like lighting an old-fashioned butane lighter (i.e., you have to click it a few times). The only downsides are that it is difficult to find the replacement cells or the curling iron and, since 9/11 you can't really travel with flamable butane cartridges."
4,My iron is not steam!!!,"As I'm inclined to use cordless curling irons, this is a good product, however the one I purchased is not steam, it is just a regular curling iron/brush. It does take longer than some of my other irons to heat up. It is difficult to find energy cells for it as well. The energy cells are also getting far too expensive. Less than one year ago, I could buy a package of two for $6.63 and now we are paying around $30.00 for a pack of 2!"
1,Not worth the money,I tried to use this Styler on a European trip. It didn't work very well. I would never buy it again!
3,Barrel of Monkeys,"The concept of linking the Monkeys is interesting--but the monkeys are not. They feel and appear cheap, the facial features lack definition, and the edges are not well defined. This is just another toy with pieces to scatter."
1,Not As Pictured,Why would anyone who remembers these guys read the reviews?I hope that you do as I did not.Really disappointed to receive- Bad Blue Monkeys.
4,Classic Barrel of Monkeys,"Exactly as I remembered it as a child, I sent this as a gift to some soldiers in Iraq and it has held up in extreme conditions both hot and cold."
1,Less fun than a Barrel of Red Monkeys,"This game is not entertaining at all. Why would they put the monkeys in a blue barrel? It takes away from all the fun. If you want a good time, try the yellow or red barrel. I, for one, will be returning my ""blue"" barrel in favor of the superior ""red"" model."
5,Worthwhile for the Quintet,"Stoltzman's version of the Mozart Concerto is decent. It's not the best, but it's good. I find the Quintet, on the other hand, to be just great. While not everyone agrees with this, I think Stoltzman has a way with more lyrical music. He has a gift for expressive playing that I've found in few other recorded clarinetists. I think this very expressive playing also lends itself well to the more intimate feel of the quintet.Stoltzman has worked with the Tokyo Quartet on other CDs, and they seem to make a great team. I haven't heard many other recordings of the Quintet so I don't have much to compare it to... however, I don't need a comparison to know good playing when I hear it. As is usually the last line in ANY Stoltzman review -- it's not the most traditional rendition, but it's definitely worth hearing (more than once too!)"
4,Esquivel,"Esquival is one of my favorite Latin band leaders. His music is very fresh, crisp, and exciting. Many songs written by himself plus other hits from the past. His horns, woodwinds and piano make his music exciting to listen too. If you haven't heard Esquival you own it to yourself to try one of his many albums."
5,John Browning's Barber Concerto is First Rate!,"To have John Browning's interpretation (the concerto was written for him) on digital format is a priceless treasure. Samuel Barber was a devoted fan of Browning, and it would seem that Browning had an incomprehensible understanding of Barber's music. This collaberation makes for an exciting recording of an incredibly complex piece of music! The performance of the Symphony is straightforward and uncomplicated, though it lacks the luster of the Concerto performance. Overall, 5 stars!"
5,This is it!,"When it comes to the Barber Piano Concerto, the credit goes to the American pianist John Browning, who premiered the work with the Boston Symphony back in 1962 in New York. This rendition of the concerto featuring the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Leonard Slatkin has totally blown me away. Not only is it exciting but it is so neatly put together and well-delivered that almost sounds like a live performance. Highly recommended to those who are new to this concerto or who simply love this piece. Voilà! Salute to Samuel Barber."
4,Great video-poor quality tape,"My daughter got this video last year for Christmas. We are watching it today for the first time in several months, and I am complelled to write a review I should have written last January. The video is great- my 6 year old loves it- that was the problem. From the beginning, the tape itself had a few places where the picture would jump, but I couldn't pry it from her to return it for replacement. I fiqured we could live with the bad tape quality since it was only a few tiny places, but it has gotten much worse over time.Just beware that while the content is good, you may be better off with another video- or maybe mine is just a bum tape."
3,Good but not great,"Now don't get me wrong, I don't regret buying this tape, but it's just not spectacular. It basically has the 3 female medalists on each event and a few highlights of the men. They have a few little inserts, one about Kerri Strug's absence and one about the Junoir Women's All-Around. Overall, It was good but just wasn't great."
5,Great Purchase,"This is a very old video and kind of rare to find. It arrived in great condition, and sold for a good price. I was very happy with this purchase and seller."
5,A Brilliant Springboard,"I eat and breathe books on the middle ages, and this one is the best. Cantor uses a narrative style that brings these times, with their conflicts and achievements, to vivid reality.Make this the first book you read on the middle ages. If it's too late for that, make this the next book you read. It is simply one of the best books on any period or of any genre on the market."
4,The best one-volume to own,"In other reviews I have named several introductory books on Medieval philsophy, but Cantor's general-purpose book includes all this and more. A true do-it-yourself book on the Middle Ages, this relatively non-technical volume covers every inch of ground that the novice or intermediate-level student or general reader might need to know. A must-have for students and anyone who deals regularly with the Medieval era, since for cultural and political context Cantor's book is on the A-list. No notes and not much supplemental information, and this is a put-off, but for raw information (which is mostly all one needs at the intro level) this is the book to read. I also recommend that it be read in conjunciton with or immediately preceding Marcia Colish's book The Medieval Foundations of the Western Intellectual Tradition 400-1400. This volume is more for specialists, but is an excellent compliment to Cantor's work."
2,"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here","If you are a scholar, classicist, or Christian, this book will disappoint you. Dr. Cantor's book presents much opinion, few facts, and no citations. Typographical errors abound in what is billed as a 'completely revised' edition of this work. These typos were distracting, but that they were coupled with a polemical, bombastic style that left me more often enraged than entranced, made reading almost unbearable. It is a shame that this book has so exalted a reputation and doubly that it is used in universities to teach history. I like my histories, especially when they attempt so broad a focus, to be balanced and source-based. If you are looking for a brief overview and chronology of the middle ages, you can probably find it here, but you would be better served seeking them elsewhere."
3,Breezy Introduction to the Middle Ages,"This book reads as if it were compiled from Prof. Cantor's lecture notes. This gives the book a breezy, brisk tone; it reads quite quickly. It is not a reference-quality history, lacking footnotes or even a bibliography of primary sources. There are no illustrations or maps. Surprisingly little feel for the flavor of medieval life comes through. The basic history of kings and popes and wars is all there, however. For readers not yet familiar with the historical period, this book would serve as a decent introductory overview."
2,Disappointing,"This book is written in a engaging style that is fascinating and easy to read. I was really looking forward to reading it. However, with respect to the late Professor Cantor, I find his interpretation of New Testament history and early Christian theology so highly inaccurate as to make me doubt the authenticity of the entire work. I don't recommend this one."
3,The Revision needs a Revision,"As a history major, I was appalled by the the amount of theological and historical inaccuracies found in Mr. Cantors text. Speaking as a raised christian and converted Muslim, I agree with other reviewers about the authors woefully inadequate understanding of both Muslim and Christian dogma. The things most frustrating about the text, in my opinion, were the fact that such errors could have easily been corrected (they practically leaped off the page during my first reading), and that the text comes with no sourcing or bibliography, an absolute heresy for a text that claims to be about history.The book decently presents some of the underlying themes of the Middle Ages, but I would advise all readers to take every fact presented in the text with a grain of salt, and have several sourced history texts on standby as references.Caveat Emptor."
4,A great introduction to the Middle Ages,"This is a very readable and enjoyable introduction to the philosophical, religious, and belligerent currents that swept through the Middle Ages. Dr. Cantor, an excellent teacher of history, successfully points out how major medieval upheavals that took place largely in Western Europe will continue to exert their influence well into the second millenium A.D."
2,Great disappointment,"I was very disappointed by the book. More properly, it should have been named ""The history of the Roman Catholic Church"", since three quarters of the book are devoted to christian theology and church institutions. Very little attention is paid to agriculture, technology, mililary organization, diplomacy, etc. Moreover, the books never strays outside the Western Europe. The Balkans, Scandinavia, and Eastern Europe are hardly ever mentioned, and the Moslem and Jewish cultures are treated only as external influences on the ""civilized world"", not as parts of it. Throughout the book, ""civilization"" is implicitly equated with christianity, - and only one of its varieties, at that. I ended up learning far too much about obscure doctrinal disputes, but nothing about the real world that paved the way for our own."
1,Listen before you buy!,"Please listen so the samplers if you can to ensure this is the album you want. I didn't and instead of being happily whisked back to my youth I had an album with ""rapped"" up versions of his brilliant hits. Mega disappointed and have actually returned it. You have been warned......"
1,absolutely terrible,"Sorry, but this movie is a waste of time and money. From the begining, lameness abounds. I am honestly surprised that Tim Burton directed this mess."
2,Not my cup of tea,"While there were a couple of moments I laughed out loud, overall, I really disliked this book. I felt it was entirely to long, I didn't connect with any of the characters, nor did I care what happened to them. I won't be reading any more of his books."
4,A real reading adventure!,"You will enjoy reading Lodge's British Museum even more after you have spent an afternoon in its Reading Room. The novel is witty, funny and highly critical of Catholicism. If you like Joyce's Ulysses, you will love Lodge's British Museum. Lodge's use of parody and pastiche make you feel as if you were in Conrad's, Kafka's or Woolf's shoes. It is the best example of the neo-realist, anti-modernist writing of the 1950's. Enjoy it!"
5,"A brilliant, moody fusion of straight-ahead balladry and ""nu jazz""","This is a stunning, innovative album that deserves much more attention than it's gotten. Mainieri's sidemen here are the cream of the crop of the new generation of Scandanavian jazz players who have been influenced by electronica, including Nils-Petter Molvaer, Bugge Wesseltoft, Lars Danielsson, Jan Bang, DJ Strangefruit, and a bunch of other low-key geniuses who regularly play on one another's records. Moody standards like ""Naima"" and ""Flamenco Sketches"" fit perfectly with the reflective atmosphere of the originals. If you want to dip your toe into ""nu jazz,"" this is a great place to start. A marvelous album for late night listening, and a taste of the future of music."
5,Buy this now!,I agree with both of the previous reviews: a greatly underrated and almost unheard of album combining jazz and electronica. Consistently inspired!
4,It was great until...,"I got this scanner in January 2003 from Amazon. It was great, and worked cleanly and smoothly with my Windows ME. I reccomend it for anyone with ME or below, in fact--it was very easy to use and set up. However, don't listen to the claims that Compaq will make about this scanner being able to work with XP: it's not true. I recently upgraded to XP, and checked out the troubleshooting guide at compaq.com, where it says that you can get drivers to make this scanner compatible. It's NOT. They wanted me to reinstall my brand new Windows, which wouldn't really solve anything. Don't get this scanner if you have XP or plan to upgrade to it in the near future, it's not worth the struggle. On the other hand, if you have 98, 2000, or ME, it's an excellent deal and good quality equipment!"
4,Finally a USB Scanner that works with Windows XP!!,"Although I haven't used this scanner yet - I do plan to purchse it in the near future. The last review I read was very helpful to me. I have purchased (2) other scanners and neither of them will work with Window's XP. One was a Visoneer Paperport 6100 and the other was an older model Visoneer. They worked great with ME and Windows 98. Needless to say I'm very happy to find a scanner that will work with XP at a resonable price.Now if I can find a camera.. My Polaroid Photo Max 320 will absolutly NOT work with XP. I've tried downloading a driver from the Polaroid website, but nothing works."
4,Good features for the money,"I just purchased this scanner not too long ago. This is my first scanner purchase. The USB interface makes it very simple to install. The one-touch scanning buttons on the front make scanning quick and easy. The software that ships with the scanner can be a little tricky to learn to use, however it seems to have all the tools to edit a photo the way want it. Overall this is a good scanner for home use."
1,dont buy this,"This was my first scanner I ever purchased. I bought it mainly because of the low price, because I never bought a scanner before. The first day I had this scanner, everything worked out just fine and dandy, but the next day nothing. It did not work at all the next day I had it. I did what it said to do in the little troubleshooting guide that was included, nothing worked. I emailed the Compaq Technical Support about it, they gave me 3 solutions to try, nothing worked. The scanner would not turn on like it was supposed to, the power plug was properly connected and plugged in. The USB cable was properly connected also, but still, nothing worked. I even reinstalled the software disc 4 times, and still, nothing worked. After another 7 unsuccessful tries later to get it to work, I finally decided to just return it. I was not satisfied with just a days worth of performance.I will not purchase anything anymore from Compaq."
2,a variety of problems,"First the light stopped working. Then the red front cover broke off. The cords are hard to get into the backside and this made it impossible to get the back cover on. This is where the different blow up tips are stored so those were lost. It's noisy and it jumps around on the ground. Lastly, the cord is long enough to work on car/truck tires, but if you have an attached trailer, you'll need a cordless. I bought mine years ago and it did last for a long time. Just be willing to deal with various issues."
5,Great Portable Inflator,"I used this when I changed my winter tires to summer tires and it works great. I wish it had a psi gauge on it but I have a tire pressure gauge. My only complaint is the storage compartment for the DC adapter, cable and air hose. The compartment could be a little bigger, it is difficult to get the cable and hose back in. I had to leave the adapters for footballs and such out."
3,Works as expected,This item is very handy for inflating tires and athletic balls. It works exactly as expected - no frills or wows. My only wish is that it was a little easier to return the cords back into the storage area and/or it came with a storage bag. Other than that -- it's ok.
2,They've changed the design - does not include valve for gauge,"I had one of these before and I thought it was great, a definite 5 star item. One of the features I loved was the valve that allowed you to take pressure readings without having to disconnect the nozzle. Unfortunately I lost mine and thought I could buy another one to replace it. Unfortunately the new one does not have the valve any more, so I have to take the hose off every time to read the pressure, which is a pain in the butt. Unfortunately, I'm past the return window (by a couple of days no less) and Amazon will let me return it at my expense and will only give me a partial refund. That will cost almost as much as what I bought it for. I still give it two stars because it is a good little compressor and it does a great job of inflating things. It's too bad I have to pull the valve off to check the pressure now or else it would have definitely gotten 5 stars."
4,inflator,"Campbell Hausfeld 12-Volt Inflator. I have had one for some 20 years and have used it only occassionally. Each time it has workeed well but does take five to ten minutes to inflate a car or truck tire depending on the degree of flatness. Sure beats removing the flat and taking it to have it repaired. A great gift for a child, grandchild, girl friend or wife."
5,Mostly about the Black Madonna,"9 out of the 16 essays are about the Black Madonna. There is one essay on Lilith, one on Kali, and one on the Morrigan. There is a poem by Clarissa Pinkola Estes about Guadalupe. There is an essay on Mary Magdalene. A further two are from the christian perspective.This book is a mix of the religious and the jungian. It has essays by artists, pschoanalysts and priests. It works. The most valuble essay for me was ""The Dark Irish Goddess Morrigan"" by Sylvia Brinton Perera--it was worth the price of the book.Despite the fact that this book is skewed a bit toward the chirstian perspective--i still enjoyed reading it.The authors were most interesting when they spoke of their own spiritual and psychological journeys in relation to the Dark Feminine."
5,Great book,"Words cannot express the value of this book.This book is a must for anyone who is interested in the dark feminine and the psychology of the feminine. The book consists of essays, written by different authors, mainly about their personal experiences and their introduction to the dark feminine. This book provides information about the goddesses, which is not easy to find in other books.While reading this book, I was drowned to places, stories and tales that transformed my learning into pleasure. This is one of the books that effects the mind, but also fills the heart, the boundary between science and religion."
5,The Journey Inward,"I really enjoyed reading this book because it shows one persons journey inward and how it changed her life. Marion Webb-De Sisto, the author, does not attempt to convince others of her truth but encourages all to seek the inward journey and find their own truth. As she has come to know her true self her ability to assist others has grown stronger. She shows us a window of opportunity for each if we listen closely. Fay Pohaikawahine Graef"
2,Better Products out there,I bought this based on price. I had an older Black & Decker that eventually stop working after on to many falls that was much better. Campbell looks nice but it seems underpowered compared the the old B&D I had. Takes a long time to blow up basic things
3,Great Value,"Okay, so it is not the greatest of Goa, and there is some filler, but overall a great deal for 3 CDs, and there are some real standout tracks. I like to have it playing in the background, keeps me energized. One CD is rather short, but the others play for almost the full 80 minutes.A fan of the genre should be pleased with this purchase."
3,really bad and really good,"This collection is quite a mess. The liner notes include a list of ""love songs"" not even on these disks. The first 2 disks have some of the weakest, monotone, repetitious goa I've ever heard....but the 3rd disk has Psygone's entire first record: ""Optimistique"", which is some of the better, more powerful goa I've ever heard. I can simply describe it as a fat, pounding, creepy sex soundtrack for your craziest fantasies. You'll probably have a difficult time finding Optimistique (especially at this sound quality), unless you buy this collection.I recommend you look for this set for about 1/3 the price elsewhere."
2,"Good Start, Awful Finish","I bought this DVD years ago in a sale, and recently rediscovered it on my shelf. What starts out as a poorly produced but ultimately harmless concert turns into a dreadful combination of overdone remixes and embarrassing para para dancing. Ishida Yoko does fine with the singing, but everything else was just cringe-inducing. Shame too, because she is one of my favorite Japanese singers."
5,"Great musician,great actress,great woman......Bette!",Really makes me happy when i'm listening.Exactly i'm living the happiness and sadness together.No other musicians give me the feelings she gives.Really wanna thank her.And thank god for giving her us as a musician...
1,No way!!,"I think so I don't like that awful! look like Zombies. That werid movie look like 1980's. ok, thank you Good Luck."
1,"Shoulda been named ""Dreadful""","I am a sucker for any zombie movie, or was until I viewed this garbage. The acting was incredibly bad, record breaking bad....really, really bad. I mean you have to be trained to act this bad. Where does one go to school to learn to succeed so well in acting so horribly badly? Probably wherever President Obuckwheat bought his degree."
5,One of my favorite albums ever!!!,"My mother is from Boston, so I grew up listening to the Boston Pops. My father is Irish, so naturally this CD was a favorite in our house. For a recording that was made in the mid 1960's, this really stands the test of time (lots of time!) The music ranges from vivacious and mischievous to poignant, and on the later tracks you can hear the audience singing along with the orchestra. I am sure I know every note in it. One of the greatest live recordings of all time!"
1,Useless,Simply drop the idea of buying this book. Buy Polya's books which are really useful in giving the right guidance for aspiring problem solvers.
5,Great Kitchen Tool,Great for small jobs like buttering tops of rolls and icing cookies! So great that it is dishwasher safe and easy to store!
4,Arrrg! What a wild adventure,"A great adventure for all ages! I loved Corky! What a hero! Where do you next from here? Pirates, convertables, space lazers!"
5,great job,it's a soul revival with the new album call to worship by stephen hurd going to really be big in the future get it now and GET YOUR PRAISE ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,In Dulcci Jubilo,"James Galway is always a joy...this was a most welcome change in christmas listening .Although this is a bit too cerebral for the rest of my family's taste, I enjoyed it immensely;it would probably have been wise to listen to it first."
3,"Nothing special, but not unenjoyable","Yasunori Mitsuda's Hako no Niwa soundtrack isn't what we've come to expect from him, but it is a broadening of his musical output. If you're used to his work on the soundtracks for Chrono Cross and Xenogears, for example, I don't think it meets that quality, and it certainly isn't the same style. It's a lot more lighthearted and playful than that, and good for easy listening. Though I'm not an expert on the subject by any means, it doesn't feel like he gets into a groove with this album. There are some fun, almost childish tracks, and it's nice to listen to the whole way through, but there doesn't seem to be a theme in sight. No truly memorable tracks either. He's definitely put out better stuff in the past. Not a bad effort by him, though, if you can take the change in style or are curious about what else he has to offer to the musical community."
2,Deep Fry Basket,Handel does not lock into place and will fold back to storage position when dumping contents after being fried. This is a dangerous situation as the hot basket could come into contact with the hand or arm.
3,Crooked handle,"Due to the cheap manufacturing process (unlike the cast iron stuff which is Made in USA!) this item (Made in China!!!) had an issue right out of the box which I didn't notice until I used it once and the original packaging was long gone in the recycling bin. The issue is with the handle which due to the wrong bending of a side is crooked when locked in place while in use. Esthetically looks weird and I have to be extra careful while using it. I wish I could get it exchanged, but really don't want to bother with the effort too much. Would I recommend this one? Not really... :-("
5,Surrender: Give Him First Place,"My group has opted to do this book through the summer while other groups in our church take the summer off. Every book has been good but this one is great in taking away our excuses and in pointing out our responsibility for our actions and shows us that when we fall, fail, or fear, He will pick us up, wipe the dust off of us, and set us back on that right road if we will give in to Him."
2,Slightly Disappointed,"This was marked as very good, but it was written in almost half of the book. The CD was broken and it had a lot of cover wear. I was disappointed. I have ordered two other of these books that were just ""good"" and were much better ."
5,Easy to do & Profoundly moving & educational!,"One of the best Bible studies out there! The easy lessons pack a profound Spiritual punch. Simple & understandable, perfect for a new believer or the most mature. The Scripture memory CD that comes with the book is an awesome tool as well. Be prepared to be changed, inside & out!"
1,Horrible! Worst Book I've Read in Ages.,"I can't believe this book even got published. It was totally unrealistic and the characters said and did stupid things.Main character is Julia. The mother of two teenager girls, divorced from their ""unstable"" father. Father has been harassing the family, trying to scare his wife into letting him back home. So what does supposedly smart mom do? She jogs on isolated paths on a regular basis in between her SIX jobs. Julia is a real Martha Stewart. For work she paints/wallpapers, sells her fancy special occasion cakes and does flowers for weddings and special events. And she also takes aerobic classes. Where does she find the time? I hated her! ;0)Then dumb Julia gets involved with a MARRIED lawyer who has his own ""unstable"" wife. She also ignores evidence she sees about him possibly being a serial killer, chalking up everything to ""coincidence"".Don't waste your time. I would have given this book no stars if I could have."
1,Terrible,"This book was terrible. The writing was childish. This book would have been better if written with teenagers instead of adults. The story went round and round, and the situations she found herself in were ridiculous. I wouldn't recommend this book or this author's childish writing style to anyone."
5,Excellent CD and Excellent Customer Service,"First off, the CD was very difficult to find. So when I found that The Book Community was offering it, I jumped on it quick (my wife is a big fan of Townes Van Zandt).There was a bit of delay in the shipment, but that could be because it came from Germany. I'm willing to give The Book Community the break on that one. It was through dealing with their Customer Service through Amazon that they truly showed how good they were. They were prompt in responding to my questions and did an excellent job throughout the process.If I order a product again, I won't have any problems going through The Book Community."
2,Very poor,"If you are a reasonably skilled, have read other books on Bento, and have some Bento making experience as well, then this book may provide you with some inspiration. Beyond that, it won't be much use to anyone, especially novices. There is no introductory material explaining what Bento is, nor any of the underlying principles. The recipes are very short with little direction, and assume a lot of knowledge many buyers may not have. If it weren't for the pretty pictures I would have awarded only one star."
3,Gives good ideas,"I purchased this book to give me some new ideas to make lunches as well as dinners. The main problem I have with it, is there are ingredients that I have no idea what they are. At the end there is a description of some but not all that are mentioned. This book could really use a glossary. The pictures make the food look very appetizing and my son wanted immediately to try some things. But I have to research what I can subistitute with things that I can find and know what they are."
4,Mostly Satisfied,"The recipies in the book are wonderful and it's full of beautiful pictures. With the popularity of oriental foods growing, it's not hard to find most of the ingredients either! The only qualm I have with this book is that I would have liked it to have some cultural background on the bento box. It's such a curious tradition for us Americans and it would have been nice to have some sort of introduction for the book, explaining a little bit about bento boxes. Other than that I think it's a great cook book!"
5,Inspiring,"For people looking to have a more balanced lunch, this book can be an inspiration. Why not make the lunch box colorful in content AND nutrition? A lot of the pictures feature boxes with fruits that are not only eye-catching but also appetizing. Typical American lunchbox is so boring, making people think that American mothers do not have nutrition knowledge and practice."
1,Impossible to find ingredients,"I have yet to make a single recipe from this book. I live in a small town in the Southeastern United States, and these ingredients are simply not to be found. What a shame!"
1,Geared for Japanese (or Japanese Grocers!),"I like the concept of this book (small meals with a Japanese flavor that are made for taking and eating on the go). The recipes and ingredients are geared for those familiar with Japanese ingredients and cooking techniques AND who have easy access to a Japanese or Asian grocery store. I'm not familiar, and don't have easy access, so this book isn't very practical for me. Therefore, I decided to return it using Amazon's easy return policy. Instead, I'll search for a book that not only has great Japanese recipes but has ones that I'll actually be able to make!"
4,Good place to start.,"This book is a good place to start for traditional bento lunches, and has very nice pictures (always a bonus in cookbooks). However, it is a little cluttered, making it tedious at times. I would have preferred it to be a few pages longer and more spaced-out. Also, an ingredient list would have been helpful for those not familiar with Japanese cuisine. Occasionally an unknown ingredient is listed, and in parentheses (as explanation) is another unfamiliar word.Despite these issues, I am still very happy with it."
4,bento boxes made easy,"This is well planned out. and it actually helps you plan out your boxes. Although the bento display is not as creative or cute as some would like it, the dishes themselves are fantastic. A great addition to your bento box cookbook collection.Other recommended reads:Easy Japanese Pickling in Five Minutes to One Day: 101 Full-Color Recipes for Authentic TsukemonoHarumi's Japanese Cooking: More than 75 Authentic and Contemporary Recipes from Japan's Most PopularCooking ExpertHarumi's Japanese Home Cooking: Simple, Elegant Recipes for Contemporary Tastes"
3,"Okay, but a bit vague on the instructions end...","I bought this book based on others' positive reviews, but I was a little disappointed when I finally received it. While this book does have very good pictures, it doesn't spend very much time detailing the recipes or the ingredients, some of which can be a bit esoteric for Westerners (for example, it tosses around words like hijiki, mirin, lotus root, and aburage without giving much advice on what these are or how to judge quality when purchasing them).In short, it's a decent book, but I think the recipes could have been better written."
2,Sloppy & Over-simplified,"There's no introduction of what a ""Bento Box"" is. The entire book lists out about 40 recipes with over-simplified cooking steps. It contains no detailed instructions nor practical preparation steps. Besides the big & beautiful pictures showing the finishing bento box dishes, I personally do not find this book helpful at all on either making or knowing ""Bento Box"". Disappointed.(Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 28-May-2007)"
3,Not for the beginner,"While most of the recipes can be executed as described, some are missing key steps or oversimplifying. Case in point the directions for tamago. It says to combine the ingredients and make an omelet in a square pan.What is left out is that you are supposed to pour part of the egg mixture into the pan. As it sets up, fold it in half so it sits on one side of the pan. Then pour more of the egg into the bare part of the pan. When it sets up, roll the previously cooked half back over the newly added side. Repeat the process.This changes the texture of the finished product as well as the appearance.Also as a word of warning, these will take a while to make. Some of the lunches presented incorporate 3-4 separate dishes. However you can mix and match so the book is a great resource in that sense. In addition the photos are beautiful and helps to make up what is missing in the directions."
4,if you like bring lunch to go to work or school,This is good menu book to get more ideal what you can cook for lunch box. I like all the rice cook menu.
3,"Great photos, but short on practicality.","I was somewhat disappointed when I received this book. I was hoping for a more practical how-to guide for making bentos. There is absolutely no info in this book besides the recipes. I was also disappointed that the recipes were few in number and, overall, not very exciting. The recipes require ingredients that are not particularly easy to find. However, if you are just looking for some bento eye candy or you live near a Japanese grocery, this book might be for you."
5,Finally cute bento lunches I can make!,This book was a great guide! The helpful pictures made steps much more easier! I still have a long way to go before my bentos turn out like the pictures...but I have fun trying!
2,Mediocre Chow.,"If you expect another shootout-fest like ABT2, you're in for a big disapointment. Tsui Hark took over from Woo alright, but unfortunately he overdid the family values thing. This overlong film is more Drama than Action. That would be OK for any other film, but definetely *NOT* for the ABT series. If you want to see Yun Fat kick major behind in Vietnam, chose the superior ""Bullet In The Head"". And btw, Tsui Hark did much better with ""Peking Opera Blues"". Come to think of it, this is probably his worst movie ever as a director. Still, it is not a bad film, but 25 minutes too long and somewhat overwrought."
1,"Woo is ""Better""","Even though Tsui Hark is one of my favorite Hong Kong directors, this movie did not at all show his skill. The story was poor along with the actors performances. I may be a little biased since I love John Woo, and Tsui Hark killed their friendship by making this movie. Worth checking out but i would'nt buy it if I were you."
4,great but....,"well, its chow yun-fat, yes its a part of the better tomorrow series, but no john woo, tsui hark did a decent job directing but held off to much of the action and has action, chow yun-fat/john woo/fans hungry for more. The entire movie was a romance, which is alright, but when you mix chow yun fat and a better tomorrow, you get a good story which you got in this movie but you miss the playfull aspects from a john woo movie. Its a good movie but it doesnt get all five stars for missing john woo"
4,Batteries,The GMRS midland radio is great and the radiohas nice features and good rangebut this radio has bad bad battery life. I bought this radio and still have it but i had to go out and buy new rechargable batteries. i found that this radio workes the best in the feild with regular AA batteries. i have used other radios because i own a radio repair and rental company i use these radios in the shop. they are great.
2,please tell me why ?,if this walkie talkie is so good and the price is just to low to show then why there is no description of the walkie talkie...i mean does it go 5 miles....? can i hook up ear phones to it for free hand ablities ? do it have privacy channels ? how many channels does it have ?why none of that stuff is shown....?Are they trying to sell the walkie talkie ?
5,Wow!,"I don't usually buy a book that has several stories but I decided to give this one a shot and I loved every story and I hated to see each one end.Each character, from Cooper and Mary, Seth and Elizabeth, Tess and Joshua, Win and Cait, they were all believable and I could identify with each one. I couldn't say I had a favorite beecause I loved them all.This is a book I would recommend to all western romance readers."
5,A great book for anyone who wants to improve their voice!,"This is a great book for anyone who wants to improve his or her voice and articulation. Mayer does an outstanding job explaining all the exercises that will help you improve your breathing, pitch, enunciation, and vocal variety. It will also help you identify and eradicate vocal problems. It's a funny book, with enjoyable practice material that you will refer to for years to come.Enjoy!Jose OteroDisc Jockey & Entertaining Speaker"
2,Weak rehash of his textbook,"This is a watered down version of Mayer's excellent textbook. It contains very little inforamtion as it is so dumbed down that is is practically useless. Go with the bigger volume, which is very good."
5,Wonderful sci-fi!,"These are some of the best sci-fi short stories for the young adult market I have read in a very long time. I should know, as I am a school librarian. I not only enjoyed the plots, but Dickson's ethics. He doesn't clobber you over the head with morality, but rather shows that it is both logical and worthwhile. I recommend this novel to any school looking for decent reading material for pre-teens."
4,5 stars to the 1978 model year - 3 stars from 1979 to 2003,"Thomas Bonsall should be thanked for this book. The anecdotes he relates on the inner workings of General Motors, and how they impacted Cadillac, are worth the price alone. Unfortunately, his editors have done him a disservice as there is hardly a page without an awkward sentence, spell check-induced typo, misplaced end note, mislabelled photograph or inconsistency. Although the definitive book on Cadillac for the period from the 1979 Eldorado to the current Art + Science era has yet to be written, this book should be read together with Robert Ackerson's opus, Cadillac America's Luxury Car, to gain the most complete appreciation of the company's post-war history."
2,wow,"Very poor written instructions. Almost like #1- install #2 - spanish on reverse side. And the sleeves that are included with the boards are impossible to install, now I know why I never see them on trucks! Oh and this is AFTER the wrong kit was chosen and sent by Amazon help. Ad said "" NO DRILL "" I am disabled and had to hire to install and ended up on a lift in order to drill all the holes! I doubt the brackets will stay on through the winter. If I didn't already have so much invested before I even installed I would have returned and bought a lower truck!"
2,Things you should know,"In the instructions it says that you will use existing holes in the truck. We had an early 1997 F150 ext cab truck, it had no factory holes, we had to drill our own. The self tapping screws they give you are too short to work. They don't have enough threads once you go through the mounting bracket, and the backing plate. We had to get some new screws. Other than that, it was pretty straight forward."
4,THE EPITOME OF GLAM,"A unique and eye catching perfume bottle - curved with a marron glace copper lace corset for a luxurious wrap.Top notes are rose made even more mysterious by a tad of rum and orchid. Base notes include mere hints of vanilla, sandalwood and sweet amber.A rare scent best for evening and special occasions."
2,Nice but Label Completely Stuck,I have now ordered two of these and have had the same problem with the label as others have written. This stuck label has completely ruined this item (on both that I have received). I have even tried using a special solution designed for removing stuck labels and that did not work. What a shame and waste!
4,Stainlees Steel Label Holder,"This is the ideal napkin holder. However, WD-40 is my standard method of removing labels and it's 99% effective; but the only way to remove the huge label on this thing is by soaking it with laquer thinner and even that was tough. What a shame to have a perfect product tainted by the dreaded permanent-label-syndrome!"
2,Sticker does not come off cleanly.,"The napkin pinch portion of this works fine. However, the huge Oxo sticker on one side is very hard to peel off. And if you do peel it off, you can tell it's going to leave a lot of residue. Therefore, we just left it on. We love Oxo but are not very happy with this product."
2,Hard to remove label left oxidized marks,"I also had tremendous difficulty getting the label off this product. I tried to peel it carefully from each corner but couldn't avoid tearing it with paper and adhesive left behind. I then tried soaking in warm water, Windex, rubbing alcohol, and finally non-acetone nail polish remover. The residual marks from the adhesive will not go away and there does not feel like there is any adhesive left -- just oxidized marks on the stainless steel.Not recommended, since the marks left behind are so unsightly and obvious. Oxo clearly needs to reformulate the adhesive used for the label.Mine had a bottom sticker that says Napkin Pinch - 1067607, Made in China."
4,Good but sticker is tough,"Nice looking holder but sticker is very hard to remove and leave an impression that does not come off, even with paint thinner."
3,Holy impossible to remove LABEL!!,"1) Like the stainless finish2) Like that it holds dinner napkins upright and allows you to pull out only the amount you want.3) HATE that it took two days of rubbing with GooGone and soaking in a bowl of water to remove the label and the underlying adhesive. Was the WORST.But once you do get it cleaned off, makes a great table accessory."
2,Napkin Review,This was purchased to match our paper towel holder with the same stainless steel/chrome design. It is not functional at all! Finger prints remain on it and several napkins come out at a time when you pull for one napkin. If I could return it and get another one I would!
3,No sticker problem here! But not great.,"I decided to give this napkin holder a try even though I though I might be spending hours removing the sticker. To my surprise, it came off all in one piece! I don't know if they changed it or what. I really like the pressure of the holder. Not too tight and not too loose. You try to take one napkin and that's what you get - one napkin without messing up the others.Update: not sure why I thought this was great at first. Now everytime I pull a napkin out they all come out."
3,Mixed feelings,"I have mixed feelings about this napkin holder. IT is truly beautiful to look at though. I just thought you guys had pain in your hands or something. Got my napkin holder today and I have to admit--it's true, it's true, the label is unbelievable on this thing. However, not to be outdone, I grabbed an oven cleaner that is safe on stainless steel and an abrasive sponge. After leaving the oven cleaner on the napkin for three to five minutes, and using a little elbow grease with the abrasive sponge,the removal of the label was a done deal and the napkin holder is just very niceAfter reading the reviewer comments on how great this napkin holder is, I decided to purchase one from Amazon, ignoring the fact that several of you mentioned how hard it was to get the label off."
3,Came with a huge sticker on the side,"The napkin holder itself is fine. You can't tell from the picture, but the sides push together so your napkins are always secure. My complaint is that Oxo stuck a giant sticker on one side of the product. When I tried to take the sticker off, I discovered it wasn't one that removes easily. I had to soak it in hot water and scrub off the stickiness. What a pain."
2,Don't buy this,I bought this about two years ago because it look fashionable and modern for my kitchen. It's actually really annoying and pain. You can't just pull out one napkin without messing up all of the others. Not ideal for efficiency either.
3,Use rubbing alcohol for label removal,"Had trouble removing the label - still working on it. Did not peel off well, so I ran it thru the dishwasher, with no improvement. Tried Goo Gone (an old bottle) and tried dish soap, with a scrub brush. Rubbing alcohol is working much better."
2,Bad Warehousing...,"I saw this product in a coffee shop. Loved it. Found it on Amazon. Ordered it. However, the sticky stuff under the product label would not come off when I removed the product label. I believe others have commented on this problem. Returned it (which by the way is an amazingly simple process - Yay Amazon!). 2nd product had same problem. My speculation is that the supplier does not warehouse properly (I'm imagining really hot temperatures that ""bake"" the sticky stuff to the product).Again, great product...bad warehousing!OXO Good Grips Brushed Stainless Steel Napkin Pinch"
1,Beating a dead horse?,Let's look at the positives. Really nicely designed napkin holder which holds a good handful of napkins and allows you to remove just the amount you want without the whole lot coming out. The brushed steel finishes off the look.Okay - the negative and there's only one. And that's the brand maker's label stuck to one side. Nothing will remove that glue and I've tried several of the suggestions here. I even started off by heating it with a heat gun but it still left an ugly rectangular blob of gunk. It ruins the item canceling out any positives. I have no idea why the manufacturers are still selling this defective item.Rather than go through the return process I intend to wet-sand down the brushed nickel with increasing grades of glass paper. I'll post an update in the comments and also a couple of before/after pictures when I'm done. What a waste of time though. 1 Star.
1,Sticker doesn't come off,"I saw the sticker problem mentioned in other reviews, and thought it would have been fixed by now. But no, it's not - the sticker is not coming off, not with the strength of goo gone that is sold nowadays. I haven't even tried it with napkins inside - it's still soaking in goo gone."
2,Sticker Issues,While the product itself may have been useful there was a packaging sticker on it that would not come off without leaving unsightly residue. This was disappointing.
3,Good design but not robust enough,"I owned this product for over 2 years. It has a good design that holds the napkins just in right pressure.The only weakness is the brittle plastic hinge that holds the two metal plates at the bottom. If it fell from the table to the floor, it could break without possible to fix it."
3,Stupid sticker,The napkin holder works well and is good looking. Too bad Oxo decided to put a huge sticker over one whole side of the thing. It left a sticky ugly mess. I might still return this otherwise likeable item for that reason.
3,STUCK IN NEW YORK,"Holder is fine, but the two and a half by three inch Oxo label stuck on the side, is very hard to remove cleanly. I'm going to try some of that Goo-Gone stuff, but I think I may have already scrached the suface with a scouring sponge, trying to get the glue off. I also bought the Oxo utensil holder and that label came off in one piece, without leaving the glue on. Oxo should send a bottle of Goo-Gone with every order! Oh by the way, I didn't think I needed to read a review on napkin holders, so I guess I'm Stuck with this!"
3,The label is indeed a big deal,"The napkin holder is absolutely great! The look and the design is fantastic. But as all the other reviews here mentioned, it comes with a sticker label on one side that is incredibly difficult to remove (and it's not the kind of label you can nicely leave on as well). I thought I can just slowly and carefully peel the sticker off but no matter how slowly you do it it does not come off clean. I boiled the whole thing to remove most of the label and had to use WD40 to clean up the remaining sticky substance. Even then, there are visible marks left. I've tried different stainless steel polishes to clean it up further but it doesn't come off. Oh well, it's character I guess."
3,Great design -- But what's up with the unremovable label?,"The design of this product is great, and I'd really like to start using my napkin holder, but I have not been able to remove the adhesive from the large (4"" x 3.5"") labels that are on either side of the holder. One of the other reviewers had this same problem -- but her label was only on one side, my labels are on both -- did you ever figure it out? I've tried everything I could think of... Goo Gone, stainless steel cleaner, soaking in hot water. Nothing is removing the remnants of the label. I bought my napkin holder from Amazon a couple weeks ago and I may have to toss it out and get a different product if I cannot get it clean. (I'll update if I ever figure this out. Please post suggestions if you have any.)"
4,Napkin Troubles Solved,Perfect solution to an age old problem. All other holders either allowed the napkins to fall in a heap unless full or held the napkins too tight causing several to come out each time. This one solves both problems. The only thing that kept me from giving it five stars was the darn product label. Have tried 3 different kinds of solvent to remove the glue to no avail. OXO use a different glue on your stainless steel products.
3,Nice looking but sticker a bear to get off,"On one side, this looks like a lovely napkin holder. The shape is very nice and it holds the napkins in very well, yet they are easy to remove. I love the design. My big gripe is about the giant product sticker they put on the other side. It took a long time to get the sticker off, and I still couldn't get all of the residue cleared from the napkin holder. There are a few small scratches now from trying to dig off the sticker. I'll try some Goo-Gone and update this review if it completely clears the gunk away."
3,It's ok,"I wasn't impressed with the ""pinch"". I thought it would have a little more tension. It's just ok. I do like the look of it and that it's upright."
1,Don't waste your $$,"Very weak hinge system, absolutely permanent sticker takes up whole side. I used 1/3 bottle of Goo Gone, soaked overnight, and about an hour's worth of elbow grease - this thing is on there to stay, and in my opinion, for that reason only the product is defective, unusable and awful. I sent mine back."
2,Don't purchase this napkin holder!,"First of all, there is a huge sticky label on the side which is very difficult to get off and leaves a stain. Doesn't wash well and leaves water spots. Not very attractive with the spot from the label and water marks.Ellie"
3,I've heard better arrangements,"Don't get me wrong -- I still love it, but I;ve heard such beautiful arrangements of this piece that even though the piece itself makes the music good, I was dissapointed by the arrangements. However, A friend of mine who wasn't familiar with Pachabel thinks it's wonderful ... as for me, I'm going to shop again for this one."
2,Not so great,"Some of the arrangements on this CD are pretty good, but some are not. I get the feeling the producers needed to ""fill"" some, so they took some synthesizers and used those versions.I wonder where is the original organ version, or the string quartet version? its a sad thing that these versions are missing. I would keep to one or two favourite versions rather than the addle of those on this CD.This CD might be good for those obsessed, those looking for some better version of the cannon than what they have (the string quarted is by far one of the best), or people who have an interest in music and intend to compare and listen.Personally, I'd buy many, many other CDs first, though this one was interesting."
4,Good thing x 8,"If you'd told me that I could listen to eight consecutive versions of the same music, I would have been maybe just a tad skeptical. Yet, I just did exactly that and I am now a believer. I gave it four stars because although I do like Cleo Laine, I feel that her vocal version here is sort of like, ""which one doesn't belong?"" from this set, Galway's excellent flute accompaniment notwithstanding. If you find the Canon in D compelling, then by all means consider this CD."
3,Nice background music,I listen to this and other classical while I am working. Really helps me to stay focused and shut out the noise around me.
4,great melody,I thought that I would get tired of hearing the same song over and over but this cd keeps me listrning it over and over.
1,Pachelbel's Greatest Hits:Canon D,"I love his music, but this CD would not play correctly. I tried it on 4 different CD players. It played like the old vinyl when they would get scratched. Was unbelievable because I can't return it after opening it. Not buying any more CD's from Amazon. I didn't want to give it any stars, but had to in order to send this review."
2,Ehh...,"I am a big fan of the Landau book on Classical mechanics, but this one doesn't come anywhere near the clarity presented in that text. The notation in the book is archaic and does not process well into other texts. I do, however, like the method he goes about presenting material -- it's just necessarily more difficult than it needs to be. I would recommend Srednicki or Peskin for more advanced texts, and Zee for an introductory text."
5,The second best L&L book,"If you are a fan of the L&L series and you are taking a particle physics and/or Quantum Field Theory coarse, then this is an excellent supplement. My opinion, the second best L&L book behind the Mechanics book."
3,Photographic Emulsion Cleaner 4 oz spray,Does not work as well as I had hoped. Smell is really strong. I suggest using it outside!
2,Not so useful for hobbyist,"This stuff is just plain noxious. You can't use it in the house. I used it outside on the porch, spraying a tiny bit on a PEC Pad and wiping the slide. Some of the older (ca. 1963 Kodachrome) slides were damaged by the fluid. It worked well on newer slides. The best results were obtained when slides were so dirty that they were basically unusable any other way. Some had mildew on them and this cleaned them up pretty well. It also removes gummy deposits well. In most cases, just blowing dust off the tray-mounted slides using canned air, them blowing off the scanner platten glass and immediately scanning, was the best way to get clean scans. Also, light brushing with a lens brush can be helpful, as well as light rubbing with a PEC Pad. Using this photographic emulsion spray is definitely a last resort. After scanning several thousand slides, I still have most of the bottle left."
4,Excellent for what it is intended,"I have used this successfully for years on all types of color film. However be aware that Kodachrome (processed by Kodak) had a protective coating applied to the emulsion side after processing, which will be removed. This is OK so long as you remove the whole coating. Partial removal will leave streaks.Some who have written negative reviews seem to be using this on older celluloid-based films which most solvents will probably dissolve.Another reviewer complained about streaks. These will occur if you wipe repeatedly with the same cloth or pad. Don't refresh the solution - take a new pad and spray it with a fresh amount or Pec-12 for each wipe.And don't use this for water-based stains. The only ""solution"" there is a complete water re-wash followed by careful, dust-free, low-temperature drying. If you don't know how to do this, seek professional help.

1,Buy this if you want to destroy your negatives,"I used this cleaner, per instructions, on some old Kodak Tri-X B&W film and it ruined them permanently. It left a sprinkling of white dots all over the emulsion. I followed the instructions to remove the dots, and it made it worse. I wrote the company about it twice, and got no reply. Luckily I stopped after a few negatives, but the ones it ruined were irreplaceable. I threw this crap out the next day."
3,PHOTO,"I'M SURE THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT, IT DIDN'T WORK FOR ME, I HAD WRITTEN NAMES ON THE BACK OF SOME PICTURES AND STACKED THEM UP. THIS INK GOT ON THE FRONT OF SOMEOF THE PICTURES, I HAD HOPED THIS WOULD REMOVE IT, BUT NO SUCH LUCK."
1,not as described,This is described as a Makita Chuck Key but is is made by Jacobs and does not fit the Makita drill model that I listed to find it. The spindle is too large for the holes in the chuck.
2,makita chuck key,The description did not match the product so I had to file the pilot by hand to fit the 7/32 hole in my Makita chuck.
2,Odd novel,"It begins boring,but soon you discover that the main character,12 year old Julia,is evil and intent on murdering her father's new girlfriend because she doesn't like the dull woman.You will want to keep reading to find out if Julia suceeds and also if she gets what is coming to her."
4,You probably don't need all of these!,"I bought this set about three years ago and I simply would not cook without them. I am as enthusiastic as other reviewers who have given this set five stars, except that I only really use two out of the six pieces.If I had to do it over, I would buy the very attractive pot and three each of the medium sized spoonula and the small spatula. I simply do not use the others. They are gathering dust as we speak.Now if your cooking is a bit different than mine, you may have different needs, but I cook or bake four or five times a week, and I simply do not use 2/3 of this set. And, it is only the spoonula which gets used in high heat environments.For room temperatures, I often find more use for a spatula which is a lot stiffer than these silicone plastics.I recommend you find some way of buying only the pot and six of the medium spoonulas! Even these wear out from small nicks and cuts over time, and you do not want to find yourself without one at hand."
3,All features of usual silcone spatulas and triple the price!,"Good, but really no better than a typical silicone spatula. I prefer a maker that doesn't use wooden handles since they wear out quicker. All the other silicone spatulas I've used have had removable heads too so I don't see any advantage these offers."
4,Best spatulas I've ever used,"This is my first review, usually I read them but have never written one. I got my spatula set about 2 months ago and love it. I've even left it in the pan while I was browning ground beef and not the slightest mark to indicate so. I remember cooking with spatulas and the more I cooked with them the smaller and more bent up they got till I threw them out. Well, no more, I truly believe this will be the last set I will need to buy. The spatulas are made of quality material, I may not have tested them at the claimed 800 degrees but I have used them cooking up to 500 degrees and not a mark on them.I would have given them 5 stars but I think the handle could be improved. The heads are great but the handles are just thin wood. I don't have fear of them breaking but I think it makes them look cheap.Update: It's now 12/2009 and I still use these for my everyday cooking. 6 yrs later and they are still as good as new."
5,Very nice replacement shift knob,"Replaced the stock shift knob in WRX with this. Very easy replacement, took 5 minutes.Looks great, has a very nice feel. Lowers the overall height a bit too."
3,It's flubbin' family fun,"There are so many movies coming out these days , even ones that have a PG rating, that have profanity and otherthings that should have given them a more restricted rating.This is a classic style comedy that truly is good clean fun for the whole family. and of course, robin williamsbrings his usual wildness to the table."
4,NOT SO EASY,"On the strength of the previos review from France, I bought this book in the hope of a nice intro to group theory. Imagine my consternation when I read the preface in which it was clearly stated that the book specifically covers FINITE group theory and presupposes that the reader has had prior, elementary course in group theory. If you don't know group theory already, start with some other book, then try this one."
5,practical guide to Vancouver,"I bought 3 Vancouver travel books before vacationing in Vancouver. By far, this was the most practical. It was really helpful because it lists public transportation lines to get to recommended sites."
5,The Princess Diaries,"This movie and its sequel are pure food for your heart and your spirit. They are also a perfect antidote for the general overdose of violence, hopelessness, and emptiness found in so much of today's media. Anyone, at any age, can benefit from opening up to the warmeth, humor, adventure, imagination, beauty, and sheer fun of these movies. Watch 'em both and experience some joy!"
2,Diaries,Rather childish. Not really worthy of the talents of Julie Andrews and Anne Hathaway. Very predictable plot line. Wasn't impressed.
4,the princess diaries,"THE MOVIE ITSELF IS GREAT AND IT CAME IN GREAT CONDITION. THE ONLY THING WRONG WITH THE PRODUCT WAS THAT I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING ELSE. WHEN THIS DVD ARRIVED WE POPPED IT IN AND MY DAUGHTER WAS IN HER GLORY. WHEN WE PUT THE 2ND DISC IN, IT WAS THE SAME THING. I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS, THE PRINCESS DIARIES 1 AND 2, NOT 2 OF THE SAME MOVIE. SO NOW I HAVE A VERY SAD CHILD EXPECTING TO WATCH THE NEXT ONE. IT MAY HAVE BEEN MY FAULT, MAYBE I DID NOT READ IT THOUROUGHLY. I THINK THAT THE DESCRIPTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC."
4,Princess Mia........,"Mia Thermopolis thought she was just a normal,10th grader.She not popular or cool,just geeky....Well,one day her grandmother comes to town and wants to see Mia, so when Mia goes to visit her,she gets the surprize of her life...her grandmother tells her that her father was the PRINCE OF GENOVIA!!!!!!!!!AND MIA IS THE PRINCESS,AND SHE HAS TO MOVE TO GENOVIA TO TRAIN TO BE THE NEXT RULER!!AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!Mia is Freaked!I mean,Gosh she's almost 16 and no one ever told her she was a princess!Well,Mia makes a deal with her Grandmother,she will take Princess lessons for a couple weeks untill the royal genovian ball,then she will make her anouncement,to take the Royal crown,or Not.............Now she just has to survive untill then,sigh."
5,youll watch it time and time again,the best film of the yearmia is a geek with bad hair and her look needs to be thrown outbut after she meets her grandmother who is a queen and which makes mai a princessher whole life changes she is given a make over which turns her into a beauty and the most popular girl at school but all thiscomes with a price ........i wont give it away but it great its worth the money
4,Excellent Movie,"This movie was a very fun, enjoyable way to spend my time. Julie Andrews played her part beautifully, having all the elegance that was needed to portray a queen. Anne Hathaway turns from an ugly duckling to a beautiful princess, and learns an important lesson along the way. It is cute, clever film and i would recommend it to all."
4,The Princess Bride,This Movie was great for young girls!But wasn't that great for anyone older.But it was quite enjoyable!
2,Another Flop that Could Have Been,Putting a great like Julie Andrews in this type of setting with almost anyone by her side would have been a instant no brainer for the writters and director. Unfortunately the writters took the day off and the director was also absent. Therefore you have the making of a wonderful story with no lines worth reading and no continuety in a plot. Sorry but this was another flop that had potential.
2,Clumsiness is charmful ?,"The movie had a nice idea but how come a girl so clumsy is charmful and sweet? She is portrait like someone who should be locked in a mental institution, she is as clumsy as a toddler getting into things all the time that becomes annoying like the boy who acted in One Fine Day with Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney. Watch "" Legally Blonde"" the girl is sweet and naive, learns to be smarter but never clumsy like that, so much that she is really charmful. This Princess Mia is an insult to the actress."
2,I just didn't like it...,"I agree with the previous reviewer who says this film sends the wrong message about beauty and acceptance. But films don't always have to be PC, as long as they're good. This one was not. I found the story and acting corny and awkward. And the younger actors in this film were really, REALLY annoying--talk about overacting. What a bunch of spazzes!"
5,Modern princess in a modern world,"It's a wholesome movie, for young girls, where they can learn healthy messages thru a funny and very well done movie. I think in the crazy world we live in, we need more movies of this kind."
1,Princess Diaries,I would love to give it a great rating...but as yet I have not recieved it. It has been way over two months!!How long does it take to recieve this item. I can't beleive it can't arrive within a week to maybe 10 days!!!!
2,Very formulaic and sexist,"This movie does NO justice to the books. Not only does it make Mia seem like a total geek at the beginning, you notice Michael only ""falls for her"" after she undergoes her makeover. A great image to put out to young girls, ""You have to be pretty to get the guy you want, because who loves a girl who is actually comfortable in her own skin?"". Not.Although, on a lets-not-think-about-the-disintegrating-self-image-idea-here basis, this is a rather cute movie. The books are just way better. So go get off your lazy bum and exercise your brain by reading them! They are by Meg Cabot. And rent this, dont bother buying it. [See my review for Ella Enchanted...ew!]"
3,Cute- but nothing like the book,"Okay this movie isn't all bad. It is something I can watch with my little cousin, but it is not the book. The book was a lot more interesting and I liked it a lot better, but I guess Disney didn't want a mean snob grandmother and a dad with testicular cancer in their G rated movie. And practicly none of the stuff in the movie is anywhere in the first or second book."
4,CUTE!,"Princess Diaries isn't used to what you're usually seeing. Itis a nice, funny, appropiote movie that Parents will loveand kids will adore. I always concider G and PG movies kid'sentertainment but this one touches you in some unexpected way.It makes you feel good, it makes you laugh, it makes you want tosee it again. I know I wanted to. I reccomend it alot for thoseyoung and old. Rent this movie"
5,gOoD mOvIe To WaTcH,I lovEd this moviE! it wuz so good. I don't havE the dvd yEt but i will gEt it as soon as it comEs out on DVD. I rEcommend this for thE wholE family.
3,Royal Troubles,The Princess DiariesStaring Anne HathawayOkay so maybe not the best movie in the world but I think its still pretty great! This movie has some hillarious scenes and great acting. Anne Hathaway who is by the way A really great actress fits the character perfectly. My favriote of the sequal style movie is definitl the Princess Diaries #2 Dont get me wrong #1 is fantastic but #2 is Quirky and funny.This movie I think is as a rate of 3 stars because I felt as if the movie should have maybe clued the viewers i a little more. Dont get me wrong this movie is good but definitly not for all ages I think eight year olds might sit still throgh this movie I dont think that many teens would be to interested in this movie.[...]
4,Girls will love this!!,"Every girl who's always dreamed of being a princess will love this movie. Mia is a quirky teen who doesn't really fit in, but everything changes when she discovers she's a princess!! Buy this one and the sequel, very good!!"
5,The Best,The Princess Diaries has got to be one of the best childrens comedy in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I saw it the cinima 6 times untill it came out on vidio. Garry Marshall has produced a real stunner hear with this one!!!!!!!! Anne Hathaway and Julie Walters are (absoulutly by far) the stars of the film. I'm sure the laughs I gave were shared all around the world. Defintly a must see!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this movie as a gift for a young cousin. Although she enjoys the movie, we were both disappointed that it didn't contain both of the Princess Diaries movies, which is what I thought I was purchasing. Although I realize it is ultimately my fault for not taking a much, much closer look at what was being offered in this ""special edition, two-disc collectors set"", I feel that the title is very misleading. Booooo to the manufacturer."
3,10 and under,"I read the book and then saw the movie. I might have liked it more if I hadn't read the book, which was more PG-13 than G. It was about teenagers, and they had teen issues. It wasn't a bad movie, I just felt that too much had been changed from the premise of the book for me to enjoy it. Her grandmother was not nice Julie Andrews, she drank, was not very nice to Mia or Phillippe (Mia's dad, who was not dead in the book) and Mia had known her all her life, having spent summers in France with her. The move to SF from NYC didn't help a whole lot either. Like I said, it wasn't a bad movie, it just deviated from the book a lot. Which probably had to happen for it to get a G rating and be suitable for kids under 10."
3,Take the title to serve and be heard.,"Wow, this will be review 334, so I guess this was hardly an undiscovered movie except for me. A Gauky insecure 15 year old girl whose life goal is to be invisible finds out that her father was a prince and she is a princess. This is a very cute, family friendly movie from Disney that has some laugh out loud moments. This movie reminded me more of MISS CONGENIALITY than MY FAIR LADY, probably because of the way the Mia character was played by Anne Hathaway..Also, because of the make over turned a frogette into a princess.Mia must decide if she will accept the title. Ultimately, her decision is based on her ability to influence others, rather than be the invisible girl.My daughters like this movie and I give it 3.5 stars rounded down to 3 stars. My daughters love MISS CONGENIALITY, which we gave 4 stars. Either one will brings smiles and warm the heart."
5,Fun stuff,"The movie ""The Princess Diaries"" was so much different from the book! I loved the book, so I was very excited to see the movie. To my surprise, it was totally different! I actually liked the movie more than the book though, finding it to be more approperiate and lighthearted. In the movie, Mia Thermopolis is a gawky, funny looking fourteen year old girl. She thinks she has it hard enough as it is, having had her father die around three months ago. Not at all...her grandmother flies in right away from Genovia, for tea. During ""tea-time"" Mia finds out that she is princess of Genovia (the fictional country in Europe that her grandma runs), and she has to go to a fancy ball in a few weeks. Mia goes through a huge transformation and finds herself facing problems with her best friend Lilly, school, and her soon-to-be boyfriend Josh. This movie is hilarious, and much better than the book, because it's a clean, family movie."
5,Great Movie,"I loved this movie!!!It is funny and it really makes you feel good all over. Even my dad, who is not into these movies (like most guys), loved it."
4,A pleasant surprise. . .suitable for the entire family.,"In this day and age, it is very rare for an entire family to be able to sit down and view a movie together. ""The Princess Diaries"" is a wonderful exception to that rule. The plot can best be described as ""My Fair Lady"" in a teenage setting and stars the incomparable Julie Andrews in the role of the Queen of ""Genovia"" who must -- quickly -- try to transform her granddaughter from a shy ""nerd"" into someone who will be the next monarch.Compared to most of what is out there today -- even for youth -- this movie is almost entirely without offensive material, yet still manages to produce a solid plot and great humor.Recommended."
1,"Read the book, and save money and your sanity.","This has to be the worst movie I've see all year!!! If it was possible to give it no stars I would. The book is sarcastic and witty while the movie, sadly, is sachrine drivel. The movie script reads like it was based on a sixth grader's book report of the back of the book. Disney hacked a wonderful book to shreds and commited its burned peices to film. I can't wait for a remake, this book deserves much better than this film could ever hope to provide."
1,Books are way better,"I saw this movie before I read the books, but the books are so much better than this movie. I was surprised that there was so much stuff changed. The only thing they used was the fact she was a princess. In the book, Grandmere is completly evil but in the movie she is wonderful. Anne Hathaway was not good at playing Mia. The books were so much more funny, but Anne Hathaway lacked the quirkiness of Mia. Read the books!"
1,Disgusting.,"Am I the only person who was sickened by this film? A ""family film""? If I had a daughter, I wouldn't let her within 20ft of this movie. Mia (Anne) is supposed to be uncool- we know this from her frizzy hair and clumsiness. But once she gets a make-over, with her hair straightened and her eyebrows plucked, her life is suddenly better. Because she is pretty and a princess, people suddenly like her, and she gets the guy. Of course, we all know he wouldn't have even looked at her before she got her make-over. Is this what we are teaching young girls? That being happy depends on their physical beauty? The whole concept is disgusting."
5,great film,This film is one of the best ones I have ever seen because it is about ME and yes I am real!!:)
1,The Ugly Duckling meets Pretty Woman,"Disney movies have all the same plot elements, so I was able to predict the rest of the movie within 30 minutes of watching it...an ""ugly"" duckling girl turns out to be princess of some unknown country of people with an undeterminable accent who give her a makeover to look all fake and ""beautiful"" and teach her proper manners while she's going to high school and has always liked the jerk jock that didn't pay any attention to her when she was ugly unlike the nice quiet guy that did who she ends up blowing off for the jock only to be swept up in a series of embarrassing mistakes with the jock who she finds out what he's really like and has thought to have lost chances with the quiet guy but miraculously appears all slick and handsome at her special royal ballroom party and they dance and kiss and I puke. There, now you don't have to see it, because you already have (i.e. every teenage romance ever made)."
1,Are you kidding me?,"4.5 stars? I can't believe it! This movie is awful!I'm not a guy and I'm a teenage girl, but seriously who will love this dumb movie?Ok, there's a normal girl find out she's princess blah blah blah... so damn boring! The story is pointless, acting are anoying, not fun, not funny, unrealitic...etc.,etcI hate this movie."
1,"Is The A*teens Music Video ""Heartbreak Lullaby"" On The DVD???","I just wanted to find out and please let me know dat is the A*Teens music video ""Heartbreak Lullaby"" which is part of the soundtrack for the movie on the Princess Diaries DVD ..lyke as in the Bonus Features or something?? ive been trying find out but i cant so plzz lemme know cuz I just wanna get the DVD for the music video!!!"
1,Girl movie,Girls in this movie are portrayed as underdogs struggling against stupid boy bullies. It's a pretty way to boy-bash and promote sexist stereotypes that girls are good and boys are bad..
4,"Wonderful, if somewhat predictable, escapist entertainment..","I think this is a perfect DVD for mother and daughter to watch together. I actually watched it with my best friend during a ""girls only"" weekend. Julie Andrews is different than you've seen her before - as the queen of a small country who has come to ask her granddaughter to accept the throne in order to continue the line of succession. There is a catch - her granddaughter didn't know her father was royalty! Not to mention that her granddaughter is kind of a geek and certainly not concerned with etiquette, fixing her hair, etc. She does have a crush on the best-looking boy in school and you can guess that they get together once she is made-over as a princess. However, that is not the end of the story. I won't ruin it for you here, even though once you see the movie, you can probably predict the ending! It's still great, clean fun."
5,delightful,I found this movie to be a delightfully entertaining and well-done movie. I think the casting was perfect.
4,Enjoyable film,"I enjoy both of the films.Enjoyable but not perfect films. The reason I saw both in the first place was to watch Julie's performance.She is perfect in her role as Queen Clarisse Renaldi.Hector Elizondo was also god in his Joseph/Joe role in both films.I hated Larry Miller's character. It was SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY. I found it hurtful & rude.This special edition is good. You have both the wide screen & full screen viewing options.Extras good. Outtakes, deleted scenes good.The ""A New Princess"" on disc 2, the ""making of"" special was good as well BUT MISSING 1 THING. WHERE THE HECK WAS HECTOR ELIZONDO? A staple in Garry's films, why was he not spoken to? That I thought was disappointing not to have that."
3,"Lovely, but could have been better...","More love, a better Mother, a grandmother who might have loved her the tiniest bit BEFORE she's about to be princess.... ahem.None of the magic of the Sound of Music that's for sure.The best scenes are the pygmalion (sp?) scenes where Anne Hathaway's character ""Mia"" is transforming from ugly duckling into swan - that goes by TOO fast. It's downhill from there. It could have been really great with the love story made more of a part of the story."
3,Sweet and funny but no classic,"Julie Andrews and Anne Hathaway have a great grandmother-granddaughter chemistry, and Hector Elizando is always dependable and totally likeable. It's sweet and funny, total fluff, and a great movie for young girls who will really enjoy this. If it weren't for Julie Andrews I wouldn't have bothered to see this film. She's one classy broad! The handholding between Queen and Chauffeur was a little saccharin and a bit hard to swallow. Seems the best (funniest) scenes were in a very well-cut trailer."
5,Princess Diaries is great!,"""The Princess Diaries,"" starring anne hathaway and julie andrews, is an awesome movie. I saw it in august and can't wait for the dvd. Mandy Moore is also in it, which makes me proud. The movie is actually pretty funny for a ""G"" rated film, and is very cool. Plus the soundtrack is also awesome, so you should buy it with the dvd/video if you already hadn't (i bought it the day it came out:). The soundtrack has songs by mandy moore, myra, and a really cool song from the 3g's. so buy it! you'll be satisfied."
3,great yet bleh.,"I loved this DVD, that is , the first time I saw it. After that it got really boring. There wasn't enough action. I would not buy this if you are into action."
2,Princess Diaries,I didn't read the fine print with this purchase the region was the for dvd players that come from england so I had buy another copy that would work with an American made dvd player.
1,Don't waste your Money! Ripoff!,"I bought this movie for my daughters birthday, it turns out this isn't the actual movie, this is the kind of special featured movie were this guy talks about behind the scenes stuff throughout the entire film! My daughter was super disappointed! I want my money back! It doesn't even say on the package anywhere that this is a special feature behind the scenes directors cut or whatever! Don't waste your time, energy or money on this product......"
1,wrong choice,"Make sure you read about it I didn't know there were movies you could buy and not watch in the U.S. when you live here something about watching in different country. Sorry i thought if i lived is the U.S i would want to watch it here. It was easy to return it so they are good with that, and I learned something so it was a learning thing. This is the first time I has a problem with something i bought at Amazon but they were great about fixing it. I think its a great place to shop..."
3,Not LIKE NEW!,OK SO I BOUGHT IT CUS IT SAID LIKE NEW. THIS WAS NOT AT ALL NEW. LIKE NEW MEANS NO SCRATCHES NO DAMAGE. THERE WERE SCRATCHES ALL OVR IT. THE ONLY REASON Y ITS GETTING 3 STARS IS CUS IT PLAYED.
3,"Hathaway engaging, plot by the numbers","A predictable teen fantasy in which a downtrodden San Francisco 15 year old discovers that she is actually a princess of Genovia. Some of the conflict and giddiness seem believable and real, as when Mia (Hathaway) takes advantage of her popularity to go on a date with the most popular (and jerky) boy at school, or when Mia is embarrassed that her mother is planning a date with a teacher. There are also some touching moments between Mia and her bodyguard-turned-chauffeur. But there is too much that seems phony; it's a given that the climactic ball will be a chance for Mia to save the day and get a romantic moment with her true-blue boyfriend-to-be, but the filmmakers shouldn't have made the mistake of making Mia blind to the benefits of being a princess; more importantly, they shouldn't have tried to play off Mia's newfound royalty as a cause for derision by her peers."
3,"Okay, but Not as Funny as It's Credited For","If you can call being a clutz funny, you will think this movie is hilarious. Instead of clever wit, situational comedy, this movie relies on the constant clutziness or maybe clumsiness of the main character Princess Mia to sustain the story. She's a nerd, yes, and a fish out of water at high school, but so what. Instead of celebrating her unique heritage and who she is, she is completely transformed into what her grandmother wants her to be - a princess like Cinderella. Yes, she likes to listen to music, and dances like a teenager, but she is a teenager. Even royal teenagers are known to dance and listen to music once in a while. Worse, when they mingle with the commoners, like attend public school, they have a hard time fitting in. In this film, they made it seem like you have to be born a Princess in order to find happiness, in order to fit into school. Not so."
5,The Princess Diaries,"THe movie is entertaining through the whole movie. It shows how this one girl use to be a geek, then becomes a princess. The movieamny kids can relate to and is good for all ages"
3,"Most boys won't care for it, teen girls probably will","As a 40 something man I'm not really the sort of market this movie was likely intended for but I found it interesting to watch anyway. Although it wasn't as funny as I had expected Anne Hathaway did a good job as a young teen girl learning about and adjusting to her previously unknown heritage. Julie Andrews makes a fine Queen, good grandmother too. I didn't care for Heather Matarozzo's character or that of the stuck up girls but people like that really exist, they did well here. Princess Diaries would make an interesting movie for a teen girl or a woman to watch, maybe even to daydream about. As for the guys, they should take a look too, it really isn't that bad."
5,The Best Movie of 2001!,Anne Hathaway has gotta be the next Hayley Mills which Hayley Mills is my other favorite actress also this movie was the best I loved the two music videos on the dvd Krystal- SuperGirl Myra- Miracles Happen in fact I got this for Christmas with a matching crown and sunglasses but Julie Andrews did a good job to I love her acting ever since I watched The Sound of Music which I also have on DVD & Video Garry Marshalls films are good since the first time I watched Runaway Bride on DVD but this movie is coming in 1st place next to Runaway Bride. Please I recommend you buy this this is the #1 film of 2001!
4,Great movie for a girl of any age,"I really enjoyed this movie. It may not be amazing, but it's funny and just deep enough to pull you in. It's one of those movies I like to watch when I'm sick because it just makes you feel good."
4,Swan Story,"The story is not all that original. A long lost heir to the throne of Genovia has been identified as a klutzy teenager who lives in San Francisco. The Queen of Genovia goes to San Francisco and attempts to persuade her to come back to Genovia and take her place as a princess of the realm. From their the typical hijinks ensue. The princess gets an education in proper royal behavior & procedures. The Queen learns to loosen up and relax. Princess Mia also struggles between dating the school jock, who ignored her before she became famous and dating an unpopular guy who has been her friend for years.The story is predictable and hold no real surprises. Despite this I still found myself enjoying the film. Julie Andrews did well in her role as the Queen and it was a treat to see her in another Disney film."
5,Cute movie!,"This is a very cute movie! Well done! An alternative for those who don't like ""Pretty Woman."" The movie trailer basically tells you what its about and its very family appropriate. Nothing to blush about here. Its more for pre-teen and teenager girls, but still good enough for older girls to enjoy. Its a very clean and enjoyable movie. Anne Hathaway might as well be the next Julia Roberts! Kudos for Disney on this one!"
4,Delightful movie,"Anne Hathaway plays Mia,a gawky, self-conscious 15-year-old who lives with her mother in a converted fire station in San Francisco. She goes to school and is alternately mocked or ignored except by her best friend, Lily. Suddenly her grandmother appears in town from her home in Genovia and informs her that she is heir to the throne, since the death of her father, long since divorced from her mother. Mia reacts with revulsion and disbelief. Her grandmother convinces her to give herself a chance as a princess and begins grooming her for the throne. Julie Andrews strikes just the right tone as the regal queen who is still a loving grandmother. Anne Hathaway is excellent as the awkward Mia who is transformed by her grandmother. There are some laugh-out-loud moments and all in all this is a charming film."
5,Like A Pulp Adventure on Mescaline,"Joe R. Lansdale is never afraid to go where others won't, and here he stomps all over a dozen genre boundaries to create the damnedest mash-up ever. Kim Newman and Alan Moore and Philip Jose Farmer and Mark Hodder have been here before, but Lansdale's take on a battle royale between Victorian literature's greatest heroes and villains (mostly villains) is an amusingly absurd sockdolager.Will you enjoy this? Well, the more you know about the writings of HG Wells and Bram Stoker and L. Frank Baum and Mary Shelley and Jules Verne, the more jokes and references you'll get and the more it will appeal. It is intentionally and ridiculously pulpy, and it revels in that ridiculousness. I loved it."
5,Miraculous,"I discovered this CD set (2 CDs) at my local library. Stuart is not only enlightening, yet realistic in his approach. He has an excellent speaking voice. I highly recommend this CD set."
5,Excellent book,I have a number of Wilde's books and have enjoyed them all. Continually go back and re-read. He's a wonderful writer and knows his stuff. Highly recommend.
2,Not much substance,I can't say much about this book except that it took about 20 minutes to read and had very little in the way of substance.
3,"Crisp Daylight Images, Poor Night Vision","Pros: 2.4GH no interference, remote control, wireless, easy to set up, clear day time or daylight images, can hang on wall. Can hook into most TVs, cord included. Low Price. Cons: Short plug-in cord from camera to outlet, very poor night vision (picture was so grainy when trying to monitor sleeping baby in dimly lit room, I couldn't tell the difference between blanket and baby), casing (plastic) seemed cheaply made."
3,Not bad for the price.,"It works right out of the box pretty much as claimed. But...even though picture is ok if a little grainy, the sound is terrible and in less than a month the camera's power supply burned out. So, 3 out of 5 for me."
3,The 80's have not aged well ;-),"A few weeks ago, I had a burning desire to hear the ""B-Movie"" classic ""Remembrance Day"", and, since Napster has died, I had to buy this compilation to satisfy my ""urge"".Well, that song is NOT nearly as memorable as I recalled it, from back in the day when I was listening to the seminal ""New Wave"" station of Toronto, CFNY-102.1 FM, The Edge.There are a load of Edge classics on this CD (a German release), and many of them just don't sound that good to me anymore.The stuff by Visage, Yazoo, Tubeway Army & the Stranglers all stand up after all these years, but some songs (which are plainly re-recorded versions), to be blunt, suck !"
1,the charger that wouldn't charge,"I was wondering why whenever I tried to charge batteries using this charger, they'd never seem to be fully charged. They'd get real hot which is disturbing too. Now I see why. This charger takes over a day to charge batteries fully. Personally I've found that over a day still isn't enough time."
1,"A worthless Charger, save your money this doesn't work",This charger is totally a waste of time I install 4 AA batteries and let it charge for 3 days and it never did complete. Rayovac you should be ashamed of this product. I would suggest you fix it or take your name off it.
1,Cheap (as in poor quality and design),"The worst part is that there is no indicator that says that your battery is charged. my other charger turns green when complete. This one just stays red. Basically, I bought some very expensive batteries, which from what I understand aren't all that good either."
1,What a piece of crap this charger is...,"This is the worst charger in the world. I didn't even want to give it one star, but that was the least it would let me give. If this were my site, I'd give a lower-than-zero rating. 22 hours to charge? It's no wonder why after I charged my batteries for 8 hours(like most decent battery chargers require), as soon as I put them in my camera, the battery light started flashing. Rayovac should buy this abortion back from me. Total POS. I recommend no one ever buy this thing. I'm going outside to light mine on fire..."
4,Great advice at any age,"Whether you are starting your career or are a verteran, I think this is a great book for helping you to get ahea"
5,Incredible sound with DVD and Dolby Digital Receiver,"Good action flick. Unrealistic, but thoroughly entertaining. Comedy, suspense and drama all wrapped up in one. Best sound of any DVD I've watched."
5,AWESOME!!!! :-),"DVD makes all the differance.... What a great movie, funny and full of action. If action and humor is not your game don't bother, but it's an awesome movie overall!!"
1,The Worst Movie Ever,"This is absolutely the worst movie ever. The plot is not only ridiculous and far-fetched, but it tries to be serious in some parts. If a movie is going to be ridiculous it should at least be funny. Anyone associated with this movie should want to hide from the world forever, and be disgraced that they sunk to new lows in movie making."
1,An appalling &#65533;RIP-OFF&#65533; of &#65533;Deep Impact&#65533;,"The makers of this movie thought that they could make a good movie just by using an infinite budget, excessive advertising campaign, employing fat, lazy, aging over-paid actors (not mentioning any names - Bruce Willis), and by totally copying and ripping-off a movie - ""Deep Impact"".Well they have failed miserably; they forgot that it takes - originality and imagination too. Also, very shallow, superficial and tacky.The 1 star goes to the Aerosmith soundtrack & Aerosmith's frontman's daughter - Liv Tyler.A shamefull rip-off..."
1,Testosterone Overdose,"Absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Should have been titled Dumb, dumber, dumber, dumber and dumber. Plotless, overblown, offensive, and probably even too macho for professional baseball athletes. Deep Impact is far better ""rock hits earth"" entertainment."
3,I thought it was the Criterion Collection,"I have the Criterion Collection DVD of this movie and it is great. When the Blu ray was out for this movie, I thought it was the Criterion Collection, i bought it and quite regret to own this blu ray. Are they coming out with the colletor's edition? if they do, i will buy the collector's edition."
4,Exciting and moving!,"Vivid, well acted movie full of many exciting moments. And the comic and romantic moments are well handled. Genuinely touching and heroic at the end.The science aspects are at best so, so but you're carried away so much by the story you can ignore them. Also, its great to see characters who aren't whiny but do their bests to solve problems. The Blue ray is major upgrade from the rather so, so earlier DVD. Highly recommended."
1,it's so bad,"this movie is really bad. there is nothing good about the movie. the acting? nope. the actors are horrible and they look as if they are reading the script while acting. it's like cardboard. the storyline? absolute 5year old garbage. no normal human over the age of 5 can possibly enjoy this storyline. the special effects? it's nothing we haven't seen a million times. plus the directing it horrible. it gives me a headache. it mocks it's own self. Armageddon defines the average ""let's rent this movie for a family evemning"" movie. please. it is guaranteed to give you a headache."
1,Eyes in the back of my head...,"Why are my eyes in the back of my head? Because about every other scene I would roll my eyes and nearly gag. So sappy. So corny. So stupid. The special effects are OK, I guess, but who cares with a story so terribly written?"
5,one of the best sci-fi in life time,"I can understand how people complaint a lot about this very unscientific Sci-fi. I've managed to accept it at my first visit in theater. Mostly because they did it all the way to end like telling u right in the face ""this is how we wanna play it"". The diagnoue r very cartoony that actually help a lot to digest the whole picture, since the whole show is like a big cartoon. And I like cartoon and animation so I dun find myself having problem to accept it. Once u beyond that point, the whole show is really joyful, MTV grabage my ass, it rocks and thrill and its all that matter. The only thing that distingulish good movies from bads is, it doesnt matter which way they plot and design the show, the question is just ""how much"" can they pull off from the emotion they are trying to deliver originally, this movie is about rocking fun with space as its background and they do hit it right for me. Just sit back and enjoy 2 hrs cinimatic fun."
1,Bad Bad Bad Bad movie,"no good ideas, dumb plot, predictable, unintelligent and not entertaining at all."
2,Major disappointment,"""Armageddon"" stars Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi and many other likeable and capable actors. It is not their fault that the movie is a disappointment. It's not that I don't like films that have no ambition except being great fun, because I believe that this is a very high ambition. Only few recent pictues succeeded in being just that and ""Armageddon"" is definitely not one of them. It has great special effects, yes, but it has no real momentum. The editing is the worst thing of this film. Michael Bay mistakenly believes that the more cuts I have per minute the more exhilerating and relentless is the action. A fatal error. He should study the action scenes of films like ""The Terminator"" or ""Face/Off"" frame by frame. What's more, the screenplay gives us no characters to root for. The wisecracks of the squad is alternately stupid, unfunny or both. All this ends up to a rather boring film that also seems to go on forever because you feel already sleepy halfway through."
1,Possibly the worst movie ever,"This movie is pandering, predictable, awful. What was the point? So many people list this movie on their favorites list, which means the filmmakers did the job they set out to do - make a mindless, inoffensive, lowest-common-denominator film that the teeming masses of American consumers could get behind in their quest to cease critical thought all together. I say, let the meteor hit."
3,No anamorphic version? For shame!,"Although I think the movie is an over-loud, completely illogical and fairly disorienting piece of Hollywood claptrap, as far as big Summer blockbusters go it's hard to beat Armageddon. But I wanted to add a large, hairy and potentially sales-limiting aside to all the other reviews. If you're upgrading to a widescreen TV thinking this DVD will showcase the new technological wonders of prograssive scan and 16x9 flat screens you'll be sorely disappointed when you find that there is no anamorphic version on this disc. That's right, friends, even with all the other extras, they couldn't be bothered to include the one feature that truly showcases the cinematography and special effects (which are, let's face it, this film's halmarks cuz it sure ain't the acting and script). On a widescreen TV, Criterion's Armageddon provides black bars above, below and side to side yielding a postcard view of the ""big screen"" action."
3,Entertaining... but it's still a bad movie,"The problem with this film was that it had a lot of action, way to much of it, it doesn't give you time to ""asimilate the action"" you reach a point in which you say ""hey, everything this guys do goes wrong that's unbelievable"" it's lowest point is the scientifical aspect (how can the common people become astronauts in less than 18 days! , how can there be surviviors in an space shuttle crash carring a nuclear warhead?) For the sentimental aspects many scenes look more like a Coca Cola TV commertial. So I'm only saying that this one, is one of the worst examples of the popcorn B films."
2,Plot holes the size of the meteor.,"Oddly enough, most of those plot holes could have been elliminated with some decent editing. Extremely stupid, Bay & Bruckheimer try to hide the flaws by cranking up the noise level and jazz up their usual formula by ripping off the improbable Titanic love story plot. As it is, turn down the volume and those guys at Mystery Science Theater 3000 have their next feature film."
3,Definite Improvement,"In my opinion, this movie, with the exception of Billy Bob, Affleck, and Buscemi (one of my faves), this is the kind of flick you watch when there's nothing else on TV but infomercials. However, I recently got the chance to watch the Criterion edition, and it was a vast improvement over the other releases, largely due to the Behind-The-Scenes takes, the commentary, and the outtakes. You know a movie's bad when the ""Making-Of"" film is better than the film itself."
2,There's nothing great about the movie.,"How typical. Something extraterrestrial is coming to destroy earth and the United States has to save the earth. Sounds exactly like ID4, except ID4 was a lot more interesting and funny. The characters in Armageddon make me sick and I was hoping that they would all die. The Liv Tyler - Ben Affleck love affair is pretty stupid: who cares about them when the whole world is at stake? And Bruce Willis's sacrifice at the end was completely expected. Remember ID4 when that fighter pilot sacrificed his life to destroy the ship? Armageddon ripped it off. Take away the disgusting characters, the silly premise, the terrible dialogue, the breaking of the laws of physics and what do you have? Billy Bob Thorton, who is one ugly dude."
3,Glitches on DVD,"I wanted to give this DVD 5-stars. However, there were too many glitches on the DVD.There were exactly two(2) instances where the video would glitch. Then there was that 'long' pause during the layer change on thie RSDL disc.It's a shame that a good movie is wasted because of these stupid glitches. Can't forgive!"
3,Common sense need not apply,"This has got to be the silliest disaster movie I've ever seen. How can rocks from the same meteor shower strike NYC at different incoming angle? How do you fly a space shuttle like a jet fighter? How loud should those explosions sound in vacuum? In short, this movie defies all laws in physics. BTW, it was also much longer than necessary."
3,What?,"The inaccuracies in this movie were enough to make Newton roll over in his grave. How can they predict the point of no return down to the nearest minute unless they know with what force and angle the halves of the meteor would separate? What happened to the swarm of debris that should have super heated the earth's atmosphere after the explosion? If the crew was held to the asteroid by jet packs pushing them down, why don't they go flying backwards every time they bend over? Why on earth would they outfit a mining crew with machine guns and send along a madman? I could go on and on, but you probably get the idea.Still, the movie was entertaining and worth watching for a few interesting special effect scenes. Somehow, it managed to hold my interest more than many bad movies, perhaps because it was so interesting waiting for the next major technical flaw. I'd say you should be able to find one every 10 minutes or so."
3,there's a lot worse movies out there then this one people,"it was a flop at the box office but I liked it because I like Bruce Willis and he's great in this. certain people will find some of the story without logic but there's great fun with the supporters like, Will Patton, Michael Clarke Duncan, Liv Tyler, Billy Bob Thornton, Keith David, William Fichtner, Peter Stormare, Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi, Ken Campbell and Owen Wilson(especially Wilson, but did he have to die, huh). some of the effects are good but then again not so good. the end sure brought tears to my eyes when Willis died instead of Affleck."
5,i love this movie,this was on of the best action movies i have seen. the special effects were great. this movie is both funny and sad at times. i known i was'nt expecting to cry at a action movie but i don't care how many times i watch this i have tears rolling down my face right along with bruce's tears and they don't stop untit the credits roll.
1,NOT GOOD,THE CASE WAS CRACKED AT THE BOTTOM. WHAT DOES CRITERION MEAN. IS THE PICTURE QUALITY BETTER.I LOVE THE SERVICE I HAVE BEEN GETTING. JUST PLEASE LET ME KNOW.PAT
1,They'd have to pay me to watch this again,"When that crappy Aerosmith came on during the movie, I would have left but was oddly compelled to see if the movie could get any worse. This movie was on par with Weekend at Bernies II. As they say in Team America, ""Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies?"""
1,The perfect movie for stupid people!,Armageddon ranks up there with one of the absolute worst movies I've had the misfortune of seeing. It gives new meaning to the phrase 'over the top'. (Bigger is not better). Why is it that Hollywood insists on giving 99% of the attention to ridiculous special fx and 1% to the script/writing? Mega budget blockbusters like Armageddon are the most guilty of misappropriation of resources. Somebody please make Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer stop ...
1,Bleeeech!,"The movie was so hysterical I thought I'd never see a worse dog--until I went to see that lil' ole cutie-pie, will smith in the biggest dog of them all, Wild Wild West. Armagaddeon was junk from the first frame to the end. Even worse was the music video which showed crazy-faced Steve Tyler (father of that wondrous actress, Liv Tyler) rolling all over the stage and shrieking how he ""wakes up to hear your breathing."" Oh, brother, has he got a problem. I'm so sick of seeing Bruce Willis' smirking, sneering mug. I wish someone had smashed a bannana cream pie into his face during his big moments. Ben Affleck should have taken off his clothes to give us all a little entertainment. One idea: merge Armagaddeon with this summer's big bomb, Phantom Menace and see what comes up. A nuclear bomb of inconceivable size."
2,Criterion Collection bomb,"This movie has good special effects but an extremely weak storyline. There have been a million movies made with that combination. So, why was this movie singled out to be in the Criterion Collection? This film is average at best. I can think of hundreds better than this one."
1,This movie was bad.,"Nothing is good about this movie. Not only is the plot utterly rediculous, the acting disgustingly bad, and completely lacking of any intelligence whatsoever, but it can cause permanent brain damage. Anyone who likes this movie is an idiot. It is just another lame attempt to cram lots of stupid special effects together and ignore artistic concerns."
1,Typical Hollywood Trash,"This was by far and away one of the most moronic pieces of sophmoric trash of the Nineties. Pitiful screenplay, terrible acting, and amateur direction all painfully plague this horrendous flick. Everyone who enjoys this idiotic waste of film must have an iq of less than 2."
1,"Disgusting bluff, director ruined good story","Which was first, Armageddon or Deep Impact? Almost identical stories demonstrates how the director's vision (and beliefs, sensibility and professionalism) can turn a movie into a pathetic waste of time. In Deep Impact, we saw an incredible tale of the best and the worst of the human being. Top scenes shows human, real, credible reactions and situations. In Armageddon, screenwriters and director shows only one thing: their ""deep"" conviction on public ugliness.The Best Scene: kids in Sicilia (or like) celebrating with Space Shuttle toys 5 seconds after the meteor's destruction."
2,brainless entertainment,"watch this movie if u absolutely have no intention of using ur brain and u just want to see mindless unrealistic action for an hour and a half. under those situations, this is an amazing film. otherwise this is difficult to sit through. its ur typical american patriotism action sappy film. throw in unlikely heroes, in this case oil drillers sent to space to drill a meteor, (that idea in itself is just ludicrous). throw in a difficult decisions between the cast. throw in ur sappy manipulative dialougue. the list goes on, but apparantly this is what entertains the public. if u want to see a disaster movie like this, ur better off with the mediocre deep impact. how many times can u really watch bruce willis and his typed casted hero role?"
1,One of the most expensive...and one of the worst!,"Horrible script and horrible directing (Ebert said it best: it is the first 150 minute trailer). I can almost forgive the actors except they signed up for this awful movie. The special effects and the science are terrible. Even as escapism its bad. This movie is *boring*! ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or ""Jurassic Park"" or just about ANY other movie would be more worth your time."
2,Good special effects.,"I love Criterion DVD's but this one has poor extras,the one exception being the effects documentary which is very good.As for the deleted scenes and gag reel,*well* you only have to see some of the awful scenes left in the movie to realise that the deleted scenes and gag reel(unfunny)don't amount to much.They actually land on the barren meteor with skis(?)on the Shuttle!That would be impossible on a runway let alone barren ground.On the plus side this film has great special effects,such as the destruction of Paris when a meteor hits,and Bruce Willis does a good job in his role.This film actually shows the advantage of DVD because if you press fast forward past the poorly written scenes(the animal cracker scene is truly terrible),then you can have a very entertaining 50 minute movie!The ending is nicely done.This movie has extended scenes but they don't amount to much."
2,HIGHLY overated!,"This is the worst action movie I've ever seen. They overplay the action! The only goal of the film-makers was to see how many people they could kill and how much stuff could go wrong in the 2 hour time limit. It gets really boring after a while. Also, they try too hard to mix action-with-comedy-with-romance, and they fail. I'm very glad I didn't spend any money on this. The only reason I give it 2 stars is this: One for Bruce Willis, one for the fact that they feature an Aerosmith song on it."
2,Criterion reaches new low,"My complaint is not with the movie, which I knew ahead of time to be shallow and far fetched but with the Criterion release. I have been buying their Laser Disc releases for years and if nothing else they always had the best video transfer available. So here is a wide screen action film on DVD and they don't even bother to obtain an anamorphic video transfer. I should be able to see every crystal in the asteroid and every hair on Ben A's face. I'm not, after all, viewing this for the scintilating dialog."
2,Would you send Jesse Ventura to perform brain surgery?,"If you took all of the impending world disaster movies made during the last half-century and mixed them all up in a giant vat, the result would be this big-budget loser; the cinematic equivalent of that organic chemical substance that suposedly produced the earliest lifeforms about two billion years ago in the Pre-Cambrian era. The fate of the world is left in the hands of a bunch of undereducated oil drillers who appear to be World Wrestling Federation rejects. How could these flesh and blood versions of the Transformers complete astronaut training in less than two weeks when in reality, it takes the brightest of candidates many months? Just put aside your education, logic, and common sense for about two and a half hours and try to stay awake to see this film whose only qualities that earned two stars are its special effects (they appear to be borrowed from Independence Day) and its musical score."
1,"BORING,BORING,BORING!!!!!!!","I hate this film.It S*CKED.Stupid,ridiculous story.Try it if you wanna enter to boring zone."
1,El Stinko,"If your under 16 and want to see a pretty good cast sink to purely commercial, low levels of achievement you've got to see this one."
1,"Run, don't walk AWAY from this disc!!!","Banal garbage to the extreme. The whole thing looks like the negatives were thrown into a Cuisinart and when they were dumped out the director said, ""wow, it doesn't get any better than this!!""... after he'd downed five bar shots of vodka and rum.Nuff said.Dan"
2,Good Action. Good Theme Song. Not Much More.,"After watching ""Deep Impact"" this movie was rather lame. It's the same movie, only worse. Aerosmith song is great & the special effects are notable."
4,What are you looking for?,"Hey, what do you think this film is? It's a popcorn-action movie, so don't look ahead for a complicated plot and intellectual characters. All the ingredients for a good action - movie are given, a love-story, much action, great special effects and a exciting (not logical) plot. That's all what you should want when you want to watch a film like this. Only the ending is a little bit too exhausting for the viewer who is nothing more than a sweaty piece of nervous flesh after the film."
3,"Great special Effects, no plot",The special effects in this movie is really amazing but that's all the movie is about. But i knew what to expect before i saw this movie so i really enjoyed it.
4,Don't be ridiculous,"It was fun and you damn well know it. Fellow film buffs and critics, we all know anybody who said this is a great movie doesn't know the first thing about film, so don't write something negative in response. This movie didn't attempt to do any but entertain with humor and great special effects and it succeeded; why complain about it not having the elements of a serious film when it doesn't attempt to. You want a film to complain about for being pretentious and unrealistic, write a review of A Time To Kill."
2,Digging for a plot,"This movie is so painfully predictable that the only reason to rent it is to see Liv Tyler. Not for just the obvious reasons ;) but because she really does have acting talent. It's just too bad she got her debut in a flop.If you want to see a far better asteroid movie, get ""Deep Impact."" It hits way harder!"
1,a waste!,"the special effects were good but thats all. is it possible to train a group of stubborn, lazy, sex-crazed, obnoxious and out of shape idiot-savants in less than a month to be astronauts? I don't think so!"
3,the acting makes this above average,"This is very fun action scifi, with Willis as a macho driller with a heart who sets out to save the Earth from an asteroid crash with his crew. The special effects are extremely good, with memorable scenes like the destruction of Paris, but also the landing in an alien asteroid field. For realism, plenty of things go wrong in the desperate gambit. There is a great subplot, in which his daughter, who stays behind, is engaged to one of his team with Willis' disapproval. A lot comes out with that little melodrama, which shocks the dad and reveals a funny side that is always present with Willis and makes his films better than most.REcommended. This is not great scifi with some vision of the future, but it is adventure as solid as the asteroid core they have to drill through."
1,Oh my God what a bad movie!,"This movie stinks from the opening scenes to the last. I'm the first to allow a lot of willing suspension of disbelief, but this went to far. The begining explosion in space features flames and noise - neither are possible in space. The scenes on the asteroid contradict not only common sense but the movies own description of what gravity is like on the asteroid (one minute the characters sail off into space, the next they are jumping around and coming back down. And finally the heroic end of the movie is witnessed all over the world, shown with scenes from heartland America to Asia - all during day time! Daylight all over the world in Bay's mind. And you could see it shining through his ears. He's a moron with too much money. Well, I guess that sort of defines Hollywood. Beyond that, the portrayal of 'roughnecks' is the director's own idiotic imaginings, The love story simply got in the way and was infintile anyway. The music blew, too."
1,A Surrealistic Nightmare,"Michael Bay is the director who singlehandedly (with ""The Rock"") turned me off to mainstream movies. I used to be the target audience for this garbage, but something about his crass, sleazy, vapid ""style"" just got to me. Then I had the misfortune of being snowed in with this ""movie"" on tv. All I can say is, any film that plays the line ""This is turning into a surrealistic nightmare!"" seriously has got to be shredded lest it be unearthed centuries from now. And everyone (except Liv Tyler and Steve Buscemi) associated with this vomit should be gently put to sleep."
1,This is a trashy film.,This film is not worth watching - it's kids stuff. The action on Earth is simplistic but just about watchable. The action in space is plain trash. They seem to have gone for just about every movie cliche possible - too many to list here - but the 'stupid' Russian astronaut part is particularly tasteless.
1,Wanna good space movie? Watch Appollo 13,"Even for an escapism movie, Armageddon is just plain bad. Do this date, I can't figure out why oh why if you're gonna blow up a asteroid the size of Texas would you need a gattling gun? The film made no sense, to say the acting and dialog made no sense. Horrible film to watch. If you want a space adventure that is gripping and tense, then I'd suggest buying Appollo 13."
1,The worst action movie I've ever seen,"This is an extremely badly made movie. The only entertainment it provides is that you can laugh at the director's stupidity. The other comet movie (Deep Impact) is a lot better. If you have to choose one among the two, go for Deep Impact."
5,Amazingly funny despite seriousness of the topic!,"At first it seemed another testosterone junkie action flick. However, to my surprise it was very edge of the seat action, mixed in with lighthearted humor. The actors portrayed the meteor as the arrival of the pizza delivery boy. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes mass destruction special effects like those seen in Independance Day."
3,it was okay,"it was okay. i thought the whole asteroid thing was really stupid. i mean how many times is the US going to save the world. ID4, Deep Impact, MIB, and all of those other movies just made this one seem mediocre. the special effects were really cool though."
1,Complete Garbage,"Simply one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Instead of listing what was bad, I will list what was good: ."
3,GREAT MOVIE>bad tranfer to DVD,"I have had to get 5 different DVD's of this movie to get a chance to watch this entire movie. My 4th DVD skipped an entire chapter(14) and the others had problems around chapters 5 and 6. This is a great movie though I laughed and cried, I now have a new favorite movie and Armageddon is it. Fix the digital and it's a 5"
1,Biggest disappointment of the year,This movie stinks from the very beginning. The ending is so obvious you need not waste more than 15 minutes on this *&$. Is this the best Hollywood studio has to offer?
1,Save your money from Armageddon!,This movie was horrible!!!!!!!! I hated it! if you had half as many brains as a cat you would save your MONEY and not get this junky film!!!
1,You've got boo,"I don't know what this film is about.No suspense, no action,no sci-fi.What is it??? One of the worst film in 1998."
2,Worth watching but looks unreal,It appears director was always thinking about what could go wrong next
1,Did anyone notice it has better star-rating than Titanic?,Surprised!! It's very overrated and worst action movie ever
5,A Movie Everyone Can Enjoy,"I saw Armageddon this past summer in the theater. I went back the next week to see it again, and then again the next week. To me this movie was about more than just a ""global killer"" asteroid. If you are looking for a 100% accurate non-fiction space flick -- this is not your movie. If you like a movie where the characters have morals, real emotions, courage, inner conflict, and a sense of humor then this is a movie you need to see. Armageddon will make you laugh and cry while keeping you on the edge of your seat all at the same time."
5,OUTSTANDING,"This is a must see movie! It kept me on the edge of my seat for all 151 minutes of it! Action, wonder and a human factor that will touch all! Buy it or rent it...you will not be disappointed!"
4,Absolutely Brilliant!! Ignore the critisims - SEE THIS FILM!!,"Ms. G. Avery ""georgia"" (Directly below) is utterly right.This film packs everything that makes films great.Some have mentioned that the rockets are not the right size as they should be - however the rockets are new and experimental in the film plus. Who has that much time and that little to do that they have to argue about the size of rockets.Are we seriously arguing Rocket size guys, doesn't sound right.Makes me worry about those people.Anyway the film is great, the music is brill, special effects top notch, acting perfect, filmed amazingly. This is a very good film!!Reccommended and then some."
1,"Armageddon, one of the worst films to ever hit the screens","This movie is yet another flaw by the same guys who brought us Con Air, Gone in 60 Seconds, Pearl Harbor, more and more Hollywood junk, big budget movies with poor scripts,Armageddon proved to be the worst of the bunch, although having a good cast, the producers of the film should have run a second check on the screenplay before handing it off to the actors. The whole dialoge is too abrupt, the whole concept of the movie is very un-realistic, and of course based on a love story just to intice the younger generation of the audience.poor movie script indeedSincerelyAlfredo Blume"
3,REALISTIC.....NO! ENTERTAINING......YES! 3 1/2 STARS!,"I know there are a lot of people who hate this film, but no matter how stupid it may be, it's a very entertaining movie. If you are a movie lover who wants everything to be completely believable and realistic then this is not the movie for you. If you are on the other hand the type of movie lover who likes an incredible and fun thrill ride then should make film will make your day.It's an action movie in every sense of the word with liable characters and many over the top and unrealistic moments. This is a popcorn munchin' thrill/laugh and even get a lump in your throat at the end kinda movie! Well worth watching silly or not!....it's just a movie...right? so take your brain out and enjoy this film for what it is."
1,"God, no, make it stop...","Oh, man, I tried to find something useful to say about this movie, but all I can do is shake my head and wonder why this kind of movie exists. So empty and unsatisfying. So cold and improbable beyond even science fiction.And adding to the pain is an excruciatingly bad Aerosmith ballad on the soundtrack.Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay must be stopped.Just stay away if you haven't seen it yet. Run screaming. Save yourself."
3,Disappointing,"Both the original release on DVD and this Criterion edition, though having great features, aren't enhanced for hd tv's and the picture quality is so low and boxed in that you might as well get the Blueray. Recent viewings of past dvd transfers definitely shows flaws, look for digital transfer technology and not all packages are the same. Loved the film, a fun action flick with lots of silliness and fun effects typical of Micheal Bay."
3,"A Predictable Movie, But Fun",This movie starts off with some great effects and some good scenes featuring the drilling crew. It sets up a very predictable plot and is not that exciting by the end. But for a good price it is worth getting.
4,Bruce Willis back in sweaty vest mode! Yeeha!,"The third Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer collaboration, Armageddon sees Bruce Willis back in sweaty vest modein this spectacular sci fi asteroid action fest. And while this does have it's flaws, it's still a cracking high-octane film filled with action and humour. Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi are good make a great supporting cast and add some well-timed humour.The visuals and FX are fantastic and Bay's direction is thankfully lees frenzied than his previous films Bad Boys (1992) and The Rock (1995). Silly and jingoinistic in parts, it's still a great action film as only Bruckheimer could deliver. Enjoy."
2,DVD Lacks The Special Features,"Oh, come on! 1998's second best film (behind SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) needs more to it for the theatrical version's DVD release other than a music video and promo and two theatrical trailers. Get the CRITERION COLLECTION DVD, and skip over this one!MOVIE: Grade: A+THEATRICAL RELEASE DVD: C-CRITERION COLLECTION DVD: A+"
4,It is a great movie,I love Ben Affleck. He is a great actor. Bruce Willis was excellent. I love Liv Tyler. She is adorable
3,just have fun with it.,"The story line was a bit juggled, but it was fun to hear it on dvd(5:1).Besides, we watch movies for entertainment not for the gospel!"
3,"I hate this new genre of the ""action sob-story""","I enjoyed this movie largely because I am fascinated with the subject of planetary exploration and I readily bought the whole premise of blowing up an asteroid. To be honest, there were quite a few thrills. Also, the cast is superb. In particular, I liked the performances of Buschemi, Willis, and Affleck. Action films have tradionally been designed for male audiences. However, much like Titanic, this film seems intent on capturing female viewership (no sexism intended) by incorporating sentimental elements designed to get the tears flowing, instead of by actually adding more thoughtfullness and reality to the premise. If only the director had watched the excellent ""Contact"" before making this..."
1,HAD MORE FUN GETTING WISDOM TEETH REMOVED,An insult to your intelligence. Don't waste the $2.50 to even rent it
1,WORST MOVIE I'VE SEEN IN A VERY LONG TIME,"I can't believe people actually *liked* this movie. It was the cheesiest piece of fluff I've seen in a very long time. All the characters were so stereotypical, the jokes were trite and predictable and Liv Tyler CAN'T ACT HER WAY OUT OF A PAPER BAG. If the fate of the world rested on her acting abilities we'd all be dead. It was all predictable and utter nonsense. Anyone with more than three brain cells could pick through the inanities in the scientific parts. If you want to waste your money on a very bad movie then go ahead. I wouldn't get this movie if it were free. The only good part about it was the soundtrack."
1,so CHEESY its GOOD!,"if you have a brain you probably wont enjoy this movie. the movie completely insults your intelligence. the acting is either bad or mello dramatic. it is chalk full of corny jokes, cheesy one liners, every movie cliche imaginable and a predictable plot.the plot in itself was merely an excuse for a bunch of explosions. BUT I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THIS INTELLECTUAL TORTURE! this movie had the mandatory training scenes and your typical group of misfit heroes. i couldnt stop laughing throughout the movie, EVEN the sentimental scenes made me laugh. THIS WAS THE GREATEST B-MOVIE I HAVE EVER WATCHED! i actually feel dummer after i watch it! A MUST HAVE for all that love EXTREMELY bad movies!"
2,"is it possible to create a boring, mindless, non-stop action","This movie was full of bad acting tied together with good special effects, and lots of action. Stimulating for people without brains."
2,"Excellent Special FX. Lame Story, Cheesey!!!",The special FX were amazing in this movie and will sound terrific in Dolby Digital on DVD. Lame story and cheesy performances! Steve Buscemi is the only thing that saves this movie from being a bomb! He is hilarious from beginnig to end. Great one liners!
1,Amazon needs a DOG rating! WOOF WOOF,"Let me begin by saying that I originally went to see this movie with my husband at his request. Within 30 minutes we walked out of the thing with my husband uttering more apologies than I believe he would give me if he cheated on me! This is the only movie I have ever walked out on! Liv Tyler is no more than eye candy, completely void of any real talent other than looking pouty and vulnerable.This is an overly dramatic, poorly acted and all around terrible movie. Shame on Steve Buschemi! This movie encompasses all that is wrong with modern movie making. It also demonstrates the power of advertising perfectly. It's so hyped it HAS to be good, right? WRONG!!!"
1,THE WORST MOVIE EVER!,"Godzilla's phrase may have been Size Does Matter, but this movie steals it with its unnessecarily overlong running time! The FX are laughable, the acting stood out, and the costumes looked like they were going to fall apart! Hell, the Avengers was better than this movie! It was pure hell to sit through! Do yourself a favor, avoid this movie! You may die bye the time it's over!"
1,What a pile of crud!,"Why was this junkpile part of the Criterion Collection? This has to be the worst film since ""Plan 9""! I expected mindless entertainment, I got mindless trash.. SFX - lame (boom, boom, boom) Story - None Acting - Puleeese! Why would ANYONE like this clunker? I like dumb movies as much as anyone, but COME ON!"
5,This movie was great,This was a great movie - dont listen to these other people who say it was bad. They dont know a movie if they were in a movie theater.
3,"pleasing to the eye, but not the brain.","there is no way some of these things could happen. like the oil riggers going into space after only a few days of training, and one nuke can not blow up this asteroid. but this movie made me dry big time, and the special effects were awesome. Over all this movie was all right, and i'd rent it again."
4,ACTION PACKED!!,"This movie had it all, action, romance, comedy, suspense you name it! The special effects will blow you away! The DVD version looks spectacular! Some solid acting but a weak plot bring down the film."
1,THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!,"This film is a waste: It took millions of dollars, several actors and an actress who have done good work in past films, and two of Hollywood's most successful, if superficial, producers to make and what are the results? The plot is not only idiotic but totally predictable, the perfomances are laughingly bad and hammy, and even the special effects are boring. The entire film is more or less just a long Aerosmith video. The worst thing in this movie is Bruce Willis's speech to his daughter before he bravely sacrifices himself to save Earth from the big rock. It doesn't come off as a father who has always been unable to tell his daughter how much he loves her saying goodbye before saving humanity. It comes off as a jerk actor reciting lines, while thinking about his twenty-million paycheck and how he's making the audience cry."
1,Idiotic!!!,"Have an IQ over 50? Get a different movie. Have an attention span over 10 seconds? Get a different movie. Enjoy quality acting and a smart well thought-out plot? Get a different movie. But, if you want to see Liv Tyler and a bunch of monkeys this ones for you!!!! (no, they aren't really monkeys, just bad actors. Had they used real monkeys... that'd be entertainment!!)"
1,Too bad we can't give a 0 star rating...,"...because this piece of *%!? deserves it. It's one of the worst I've ever seen. Bruce Willis, who has proven he could act in films like ""12 monkeys"" or ""Pulp fiction"" give the worst performance of the year. I really think I should write to the Razzies foundation so that they can rename their awards ""The Armageddons"" because nothing in this film is any good. Stupid plot, bad acting, terrible directing, none of the character has any depth. This ""thing"" could make any film with Paulie Shore look like an auteur flick."
1,"Movies like this give ""Hollywood"" a bad name","God, I hated this movie. I've enjoyed many movies that snobs refer to as ""mainstream"" but this one truly reflects all of the worst elements of Hollywood--big, bloated plot and terrible, insulting dialogue. Stay away!"
1,"Why Steve, why the Teen Eye Candy????????","MR. Buscemi, why would you endanger your fabulous career while doing a typical, boring action film like this one. Armageddon had to be the most boring movie I have ever seen. There was one point in the movie where there were so much noise it was stupid. Was the acting so lacking that they had to fill in time with things blowing up.Steve, all I ask you is to stay doing film greats like Fargo, Raising Arizona, Trees Lounge and Living in Oblivion. These are the films that will send you in the ranks of the greatest actor of all time. I know you just sold out to do this lousy excuse for a movie. Armageddon was JUNK!!!!"
1,This is a No-Brainer,"Armageddon is not a film for moviegoers who like to think while in the theater. This is a film for people who like to just sit there while the film's visuals attack every nerve in their bodies with relentless determination. This movie is just too loud in every way to be enjoyable. Also, I found many parts of the movie highly implausible. For example, why is it possible at one time for the asteroid heading toward earth, on which Willis and his oil crew are drilling, to have similar gravity to earth, while at another time, a vehicle is able to float across a canyon as if the vehicle were weightless? Maybe that was explained, and I just couldn't hear it over all the noise."
1,Armageddon is right!,"Why, God, Why! This all I have to say for this sorry excuse for a movie. They blow up Paris and Shanghai and New York! All of the world's culture is gone. The science is pathetic. For example, why does NASA allow the astronauts to walk off the shuttle and into their girl-friends arms after they've been in space. They should be feeling severe problems with moving. The flag-waving reaches unbearable proportions. After the first two hours we wonder if they save the world yet. Everybody is just stupid. The best actor is probably Dotty, the woman who has the asteroid named after her. Why is there a Maxim machine gun if the general said he didn't trust those retards with a potato gun? And he let them jack around with a nuclear bomb. Don't be surprised if Las Vegas is nuked for July Fourth fireworks. I won't continue on the lack of plot, lame and impossible science, and other fallacies."
1,Armageddon really tired of this movie,"Firstly, (I honestly do not know where to begin) even Ed Wood could imagine a more cogent film than this cerebral fodder.I must admit, I am more upset that the film was even made, simply having Hollywood cash in on people's fears of the supposed 'end times' is bad enough, but if this is how you profit from it, at least make it entertaining and thoughtful enough to not feel like a lobotomy. Enough, Bruce, enough."
1,Non stop action killed any story plot that may have existed,"The movie had graeat special effects and the asteroid plot was good, but it all ends there. The continuous sequence of one action scene after another left no room for the development of a story line. The action scenes so prempted film scripting that I was left with the feeling that there was no script. It was like watching a very long video game. I am a fan of action movies and science fiction movies but this one is the worst that I have ever seen. I gave it a 1 star rating because there was nothing less to choose from"
1,This was a 2 hour video game made into a movie.,"The plot was completely unrealistic, and the continuous action just drowned out what ever story line there was. I rate this as one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I am a Science Fiction fan. I gave it a 1 star rating because there was nothing lower to choose from."
1,Criterion collection? why?,"More proof that special effects cannot carry a movie alone. Why did Criterion decide to add this tired genre movie to it's collection? If you ever want to know whats wrong with big budget movies, this is a perfect example. Stereotypical charactrers, thin on plot, and a truck load of(welldone) special effects. Get 2001 instead."
1,A Waste of Time,"The worst movie of the nineties. An absolute waste of time. So predictable it is laughable.If I hadnt bought a large soda before the movie, I surely could have had a nice nap during the movie. If you want to see Bruce Willis in a good movie, do NOT watch this catastrophe of filmmaking."
5,Loads of Fun!,This movie is pure entertainment from start to finish. The action keeps comming with special effects and sound worthy of 5 stars. You won't be sorry.
5,"Best space movie I""ve seen!","The special effects were stuppendous, and Bruce Willis was in his best form. I recommend this movie."
2,Deep Impact is much better,Not worth the time or money to watch. Saw it in the theater ONCE and that's all I'll be watching it.
4,great actors and effects as well as story,this movie put those three factors together and made a great movie this was the first Ben Aflek movie I ever saw and he is a great actor the story was very interesting and it came out at about the same time as Deep Impact Deep Impact wasn't a very good movie but this one was mainly due to its great story who cares if some of the stuff isn't scientific
4,Bless this Mess,"Jerry Bruckheimer crams American flags into every scene possible in this 'save the earth' flick that was the top money earner in the year it was released. The better of 2 killer asteroid movies that came out the same time (yeah, yeah... I know the other one was a 'comet'. So sue me.)Good date movie - action/explosions for the guys and love-story/tear-jerker ending for the gals.Actually, I think we all cried. Go ahead, it's ok to admit it."
5,How Armageddon Rules!!,"Asteroids, spaceships, and......... Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler! These two make a great pair! Having no trouble with onscreen acting. Wait! They are not the only reasons to love this movie. It is funny with a very good script. All the actors and actresses deliver it beautifuly! With great special effects! You'll just cry when... oh wait I cant tell! Even if you don't want to cry you will laugh alot!"
3,It was good in the middle but the ending could use some work,I think the ending was dumb. I liked it in the middle when the meteors hit.
1,Disappointing,"I've seen it before---bad movie,but it's just so hard to take when the actors I adore are in it."
4,reality sucks,"Yes, Deep impact had a more coherent story line. Yes Deep Impact was more realistic. But come on...did anyone really believe John Mclain was such a super cop in Die Hard? No, we went to be entertained. I like watching movies to escape reality, not live it. I can pick up the newspaper or watch the news anytime I want a reality check. Being a guy, I absorbed as much of the bass and sound effects that I possibly could and loved every minute of it. Excellent movie if you want action. Looking for romance? Get Pretty Woman or something, this movie isn't for you."
3,Can you Love it AND Hate it?,"This movie is so over-the-top and ridiculous, you really need to leave any sense of realism at the door. Every stereotypical, action-movie element, character and montage is here, complete with rock video editing and blaring guitars, women weeping for their men, tough guys with heart. On the other hand, you can't help but watch and then cheer when the good guys save the day, and our hero returns to the woman he loves. If you consider yourself a film critic, stay away, it's horrid (ack, that dialogue!) But if you're looking for a wild adventure in space, and you don't need to use your brain for 2 1/2 hours, take a seat and enjoy!"
5,"i loved the movie, it was really exciting!","The plot was amazing, whoever wrote the script should be very proud of themselves. I love this movie and i can watch it a million times!"
4,Armageddon,This DVD was a great value. It is the no frills version of a classic movie and it comes in at a lot cheaper than any of the competition.
3,I was little bit disapointed.,"This film has many good cast and sound. But this storyline is poor , makes me angry. I think this film makes audience a figure of fun. That's all."
1,"A Real Bad Weak Story Movie, in Six Words",Don't buy this. Weak story. Poor imagination. Not based on any scientific ground. Just nothing.
4,great movie wild effects and even greater sound,"The movie was great. i highly enjoyed it. The special effects were wonderful! I really enjoyed the picture! I liked the sound,too."
5,Great fast paced action style of the great 80's movies!,"This movie reminds me why I enjoy movies so much. There are great special f/x and the movie is well cast. The characters all seem to be lifelike individuals with their own thoughts and motivations. The cinematography was wonderful. Buckheimer knows how to film a movie (check Enemy of the State). The scenes seem sincere and keep moving. Unlike many other movies where the plot takes two hours to build up to a 5 minute ending with lots of talking (Deep Impact, Contact, etc...), Armageddon brought the action to you and kept you entertained. It reminded me of the great 80's movies where the action kept coming (Die Hard, Raiders, etc...) even if some of the plot was a little hard to believe. Overall the plot was immensley easier to believe than most current sci-fi/action movies released now."
4,I LOVED IT!!!,"Armaegeddon was a great movie. I saw it twice and each time it was just as good. It'll make you cry and laugh as well. The two lead male actors are outstanding with a fairly good role as the lead female played be Liv Tyler. There was a lot of good action sequences that kept you on the edge of your seat. The acting between Tyler and Willis and Tyler and Affleck was great. Overall, it was a great movie and I suggest it to everyone!"
5,A masterpiece that deserves all the stars in this galaxy and beyond,"Classic edge-of-your-seat psychological drama. Hitchcock would be proud! This one is sure to be added to film history syllabi. Steve Buscemi has never been better. Riveting, complex characters and a tightly-woven plot. I love the little boy who saved that starving alien. That alien was cute beyond comprehension and I cried all over my popcorn and it got soggy and I threw up on the floor. And then I went out on the road with Def Leppard. ARMAGEDDON-IT!!!"
1,Just as BAD as Phantom Menace,Everyone who have seen this movie would wish they were dead. This is a lackluster not a blockbuster. It has laction instead of action. It has Awful effects. Overall just as bad as Phantom Menace.
1,I'm insulted that Bruckhiemer thinks we're THIS DUMB!!!!!,"This has to be the WORST of Jerry Bruckhiemer's movies!!! I was a big ""The Rock"", ""Crimson Tide"", ""Top Gun"" and ""Con Air"" fan. But this movie insults our intelligence to think that we would send DRILLERS into space is ludicrous. Deep Impact is what would really happen. If you feel like being insulted by a high priced completely unrealistic plot...then GET THIS MOVIE!!! If you want to see a GREAT asteroid movie...rent ""Deep Impact'!"
3,Two good things,"Special effects and the all-american make it great for some people, but the only good things I found were the Tylers. Steven Tyler and Aerosmith did so much to make this movie popular. And Liv Tyler attracted the male audience. Aerosmith rocks!!"
5,I think that it is an on the edge of your seat movie.,"It was a very good movie, and I cried my eyes out at the end of it. I was crying not just because it was sad, but because it was a happy ending along with a sad ending at the same time."
3,Nice entertainment for a boring evening,"A film that combines both action, and romantic scenes. Suitable for all family members bigger than 10 years old."
3,"typical, yet exciting","The plot is nothing new, obviously they aren't going to let the meteor slam into the earth, but it's still exciting. The romance between Ben and Liv is corny, yet sweet. I loved the movie, but it wasn't the best I've seen. P.S. I LOVE BEN AFFLECK!"
2,Just More Hollywood Special-Effects Junk,This movie is just another example of Hollywood making movies that are big on special effects and scarce on plot. The sorry romantic subplot doesn't make up for it either. It is really unrealistic and would only fool someone with an elementary school mentality. You never once feel for the characters. This show was only made for money and no thought of being a serious movie ever went into it. By supporting trash like this we are cutting out movies that have actual substance and are leading Hollywood to make more garbage.
1,Probably the worst movie ever made,"This is the very worst movie that I have seen in at least 10 years. It is one of those rare movies where not even one redeeming quality can be found. The story is simplistic, stupid and worst of all is about as believable as your average national enquire story. The special effects are big, loud but they move from scene to scene so quickly that you end up seing next to nothing of what they are trying to show you. I fully understand that the movie was intended for a younger audience but it is insulting even to them. It is as if hollywood was saying that the newest generation of kids is brain dead and is unable to distinguish a good movie from a loud one. Hollywood should know by now that a good movie always starts with a good story. If a story is good, the special effects are not even necessary. Personally I consider that 2 hours and 30 minutes of my life have been wasted and I hope that it will be a long time before such garbage spills out of hollywood's bin again."
1,micheal bay and crew must die before they pollute the world,"This is hands-down the worst film I have ever suffered through. It makes me sad that it was a box-office success. That says something about the intelligence of the American public. Don't get me wrong, I like action movies (even Bruce Willis at times! see Die Hard), but action movies are supposed to make the unbelievable seem believable. This movie was just a horrible, soul-less, macho blather. I give it one star only because there is no other rating lower."
1,stupid,This is by far the worst movie i have ever seen. There was no plot. And the thought that the rest of the world would wait for a few idoits to save the world is laugh out loud funny. If you plan to buy a movie just move along. This one isn't worth the money.
3,"Great acting, no plot","I tought the story wouldn't be very good, but it was just insane! Everything else was great, the special efects, the acting, it had a few laughs. It would be the perfedt movie, if they only worked a litle more over the plot."
3,"Good, but not the best.","I felt that this movie had its good qualities, but it was also lacking in some areas. The special effects were great, but the storyline was limited. If you want a good story, you should see Deep Impact but if you're just there for the effects, see Armageddon."
1,Worst Movie of ALL Time!,"This movie was the absolute WORST of ALL time! Completely unrealistic and just down-right STUPID! I would have given it ZERO stars but Amazon.com allows the lowest of 1 star only. Buying this DVD will be the WORST purchase of your life, I guarantee it!"
1,Not worth seeing....,"Oh, what the heck, see it once so you can form your own opinion. Rent before you buy, please! Actually, I think I fell asleep in the theater a few times. Thank god my boyfriend was with me though, or I would have been really bored! It was a good laugh though..."
1,A disgrace,"This movie was horrible. I saw it in the theater with a friend, and it was the only time i've ever regretted spending 7$ on a movie. This movie was all special effects, nothing else. The plot and ""characters"" (I have """" because there characters were so poorly developed that they didnt's exist) both were there only to showcase the cgi. Sure, it was good stuff. But that was the only good thing. The writing was terrible, the acting was terrible...and don't ever get me started on the animal crackers scene. I almost left the theater. Please don't pay any attention to the other reviews glorifying this movie; they were probably high or something when they saw it. Save your money, I implore you!"
5,"If you want an Armageddon DVD, GET THIS ONE ITS WORTH IT!","I really enjoyed watching the first edition DVD of Armageddon, but when I bought Armageddon: Criterion Collection I realized it just didn't compare. The Criterion Collection added all the things that a true movie buff likes:-Production Notes -Storyboards -Commentaries -Gag reals -THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!!!!!!The gag real alone is worth the extra money. If you would like a taste, try this one for size.The real line was: (Billy Bob Thornton's Voice) ""We bring the world's best deep core driller.""The gag real line is: (Billy Bob Thorton's Voice) ""We bring in Bruce Willis, the best deep core driller in my a##.""The rest you'll have to see for yourself. I guarantee that it is well worth it."
1,Poor Amusement,"I amn't aganist the pure amusement or commercial movie. In fact, some products can be very funny and entertaining. It'sn't the case of ""Armageddon"". This film fails in its purpose. Director Bay stuffs his movie with a fair amount of visual excess to tire the espectator: Flashes,abuse of violent travellings, ruthless locate axes and continual changes of sequences. All finish to saturate the brain. Movie begins right, first part is good science fiction even, but all become upset when Willis and friends trip to the meteor. Storyboard turns weak and gratuitous with unnecessary trends."
1,This is the most boreing movie on the planet .,"This movie in my mind of realilistic NASA movies, is the most fake movie I've ever seen ,ever . How can a hot selling Movie Like ARMAGEDON be so fake , stupid , and Boreing . If I had my way , this movie would of got a 0 star!! I think this is the stupidist movie of all time!!"
3,End of the World,Good movie if you like the end of the world stuff or sci-fi; it's not serious but is entertaining and has some action.
5,Great story,An epic story about love and family. I was replacing my VHS and this one was not even an option I had to get this one.
4,GOOD MOVIE,This was a good movie with great acting plus special effects. But one downslide was it was a bit fake. Like the part when they fly in that rover thing. It all seemed fake there for me. Other than that it was very good.
4,"John Wayne, Wallace Beery, Jimmy Cagney & Co. Would Feel Right at Home","Drillers, Fathers and potential son-in-laws, Fathers and their children, Noble Sacrifice, Heroic Roughnecks, its all been done many times before. So What! It ain't what you do, its the way that you do it. This film does it pretty well, certainly, well enough to give the average viewer an entertaining 2 1/2 hours. Tough chief of a drilling company is asked in to save the world by blowing up an approaching meteorite with a nuclear bomb. The usual foul-ups, visual fireworks, interpersonal fireworks, ensue.Of course, Bruce Willis plays his role as The Boss with aplomb, Assorted character actors play as intended (not as lovers of fine art might like), heroism and love triumph, and a bit of tear-jerking works well. Not exactly avant-garde stuff, but hot dogs with sauerkrauant with mustard for the multitude."
2,Too Hollywood to be good,Did somebody say suck? This underdog-to-be-hero story is silly.Imagine those digging guys did their job in space.What a brainless movie! Good special effects have nothing to do with senselss and loose plot.I waste my time watching it and really want my time and money back.
2,A slick movie that is too dumb to be memorable,"Ok, I was guilty of forking out money to buy a DVD edition of this movie, but I did not see the movie in the theater, you see. If it were not for a dumb, cliched plot, this movie is very well-made (in fact, it could have been a lot better movie if they had simply stick to the pure action formula and none of those weak emoting attempts.) In order to enjoy this one, you have to check out your brain before reclining into your couch with your remote control in hand (you may need it because there are scenes too atrocious to accept viewing at normal pace - I like Liv Tyler, but I could not stand her in this movie.) Do not think of what you have learned in high school physics class. Do not try to make the connection between one scene with another. And *do not watch* a sensible action movie such as Road Warriors right before watching this movie. You may want to re-watch the other one instead of finishing this one."
2,Ridiculous and Adolescent,Luckily my husband and I saw this on cable and didn't pay full price! We DO like action flicks but this one became VERY boring -- with stupid cartoon-like events interspersed with tear-jerker scenes. You'll like it if you REALLY like Bruce Willis and/or you're 11 to 14 years old!
2,Number One Movie Does Not Mean Good,"No doubt, the special effect of this movie was outstanding. But that's all about, for $150 million dollars. Maybe that was the only reason I bought it on DVD even though I saw it in the theartre. It was just another ""corny"" movie in 1998, after ""Godzilla"" (*1/2) and ""Deep Impact"" (**1/2). Hollywood studios have spent a lot of money on visual effect these years, however, the stories are getting worse. Although ""Armageddon"" was the number one movie in 1998, by the box office gross, it does not mean it was a good one. I still have to say that the DD 5.1 sound is one of the best on DVD."
3,"Great Movie, Poor Criterion Transfer","This is a great movie. Specifically for the Criterion DVD: Criterion should have never put their name on this transfer. There is excessive picture flutter, like a flash of light noticable on the black bars. It's not terrible, but for a ""Criterion"" release...it's terrible.Criterion's main pitch is that they have exclusive director commentaries, and that's great, but the need to spend an equal amount of time making a transfer worthy of 30 plus dollars!"
2,"formulaic, uninteresting","when you know every step of the way what is going to happen, it takes the enjoyment out of it. the movie looks good and the special effects are impressive, yet the movie is boring. the plot is formulaic, the characters are uninteresting and steven tylers' daughter is just annoying. i like willis, but he just collected a check with this one."
1,Crow...Tom Servo...Where are you?,"If only Mystery Science Theater 3000 was still being made. I beleive I would actually be willing to sit through it again. On par with ""The Beginning of the End."""
3,Bruckheimer's involvement is what saves this film,"OK, this movie is not all that good. I liked some parts of it, but I found it nearly impossible to follow some of the action later in the movie.The only thing saving this movie is Jerry Bruckheimer. I am a huge fan of his, and I loved The Rock which was produced by Bruckheimer and directed by Michael Bay. I think Bay did a good job this time, but the movie just turned out bad."
2,Could have been a good movie...,"Armageddon is one of the best examples of the Hollywood machine. It has no real story to tell, Just a lot of FX, the acting is extreamly bad and the worst part about this 2 and a half hour long ""beer commercial"" is the directing by Michael Bay. The way he always keeps the camera in motion to make aveything more dinamic is pathetic and he has now proven that he is even mor worse with actors than George Lucas. The script is nothing more than pityfull and a story that otherwise could have been very exiting and entertaining, becomes nothing more than a big bunch of FX with no meaning to it. What you get for you money in the end is an empty, boring movie, with nothing else going for it exept the FX!"
2,"Bad story, too american","They couldn't get a whole out of that one, really. This is american-stressed and the story is like that... However, there are great special effects. That's all I was enchanted with."
2,Could Hollywood destroy New York City ONE MORE TIME?,"The special effects in this movie were good, but it completely lacked science! Why is it that meteors, godzillas, volcanos, and stay puft marshmallow men only attack New York or Los Angeles? If your more into realism, get Deep Impact. If you like cheese with your adventure movies, get Armageddon. I you feel you have far too many brain cells than you know what to do with 'em, you can either drink a gallon of grain alcohol or you can watch Armageddon. Just think! According to Armageddon, if we bury a nuke 100 meters under Texas, we could SPLIT IT IN HALF!!! The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because I love NASA and hate NYC."
1,Comic Book Mentality,"I cannot believe anyone can take this film seriously. It is strictly comic book. The characters are all stereotypes, the action is preposterous, and the science completely wrong. It is pure action and eye candy for the reality challenged. After you watch it you'll feel like you just pigged out on cotton candy at the fair. Yuck!"
2,Armageddon,"Just got this in today. It was shipped promptly, but the packaging and discs look somewhat suspect. The item was listed as 'new' but contained no booklet or insert which it should have. After playing the disc I would wager that it is a bootleg -- which was warehoused and shipped directly from Amazon. I can't say the seller knew this, but it is still disappointing. I own nearly the entire criterion collection and have come across several bootlegs in the past, so it's not a huge shock. I'd still probably give it 3 stars, but the film itself is terrible."
4,"I don't know about you guys,but i liked it very much","Well, i know, i know, i know that the plot is dumb, but so then WHAT?!, the acting was really very good, the FX great,and also i's very exciting, even more than Deep Impact, yeah, Deep Impact was good for me, but Amrmageddon it's better, i don't care about what some losers and critics think about this film, they can bite my (bleep), Armageddon it's not excellent, it only fails for the plot, but this film was made with the purpouse of entertaining people, and give them somehow a good time in the movies,i just can't wait to see ""Pearl Harbor"""
2,one of the worst acted movies of all time,"I gave this movie 2 stars because it IS entertaining in the movie theatre, but if you're looking for quality story and acting, this is not the movie. It seems like the talented ensemble (Willis, Afflek, Thornton, Duncan, etc.) went out of their way to do a horrible, unbelievable job. There was not one point where I actually feared that a meteor was coming to earth. The scene where the president learns of the asteroid is just laughable ""dear God..."" Ben Affleck and Michael Bay are supposed to be a part of Peal Harbor, so I realllly hope they don't mess that one up."
2,Nice Try...,"While there are parts of this film which I found truely entertaining, there are two things which ultimately cause its downfall...1. Script (bleh) 2. Liv Tyler (You call that ACTING?)Tyler's big final scene (Oh DADDY! <sob sob>) is SOOOOOO awful. Instead of inducing tears I found myself laughing hysterically.Get rid of her and you might have something worth owning here."
2,Music Video Logic Makes Armageddon Lukewarm,"Micheal Bay's Armageddon is one momentously special effectladden popcorn movie that attempts to bring in both the high mindedviewers and those just expecting to see expensive pyrotechnics and explosions. Though visually stunning and hyper kinetically edited for maximum impact, Armageddon is rambling piece of new age filmmaking that is excessievly long-winded, imprecise in its direction, cursed with an overabudance of sterotypical performances, burdened with inane and one-dimensional dialogue, and chocked full with hammy patriototic sentiment that makes this hi-tech pill too hard to swallow. I feel this kind of fimmaking is ahead of its time, but I have doubts about its potential. Thumbs up to Billy Bob Thorton for playing a new-age John Wayne. The Criterion Edition to Armageddon is a spectacular compilation of everythng you'll ever need to see about Armageddon. A must-buy for enthusiasts. END"
1,Who cut the cheese?!,This movie stunk worse than any movie I've seen. From the story to the acting this movie was incredibly cheesy. I think the move directers were a sleep during the making of this flim. The only thing good in the movie are the effects.
1,One of the Fifty Worst Films of All Time...,"Watching ""armagedon"" was like watching ""The Right Stuff"" dumbed down for an audience of subhumans. Bruce Willis ought to be condemned to living out his life in a garbage can for having had anything to do with this rubbish.I guess if you believe that it'd be easier to train twelve roughnecks to be astronauts than it would be to train twelve astronauts to be oil riggers, then maybe you'll be stupid enough to accept the premise of this peice of unadulterated drivel.What I want to know, is: Why can't Bruce Willis appear in films with a plot that has some semblance of reality to it? ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" are great films, but then there are films like ""Armmagedon"", ""Tears of the Sun"", ""Die hard III"", ""Last Man Standing"", ""Hart's War"" and so on, ad nauseum.If there really was a Hollywood Hall of Shame, Bruce Willis would have his own wing! Anyway, as of this writing, a used copy of this dog is selling for $.49 on amazon, but even that's too much..."
1,Bad,Unrelentingly stupid. Appallingly devoid of merit. It is unfortunate that Steve Buscemi would be in such a worthless movie. I'd rather watch a test of the emergency broacast system.
1,Just one big explosion,Oh why did I waste my money on this? I was rooting for the asteroid. Too bad it didn't get 'em!! Minus 10 stars.
4,WOW!!!,"Bruce Willis did a fantastic job of acting in this high suspense and action thriller. The movie had the makings of a smasher. The language was rough at times, and some scenes I would definately not let any kids see, but besides those faults, the movie was awesome! There was humor, suspense, action, amazing graphics, and tear-filled scenes at times. Very nice job."
5,repeatedly entertaining - fun and adrenaline,"I'm an engineer and the science here makes extensive use ofpoetic license. However, I find it completely entertaining andengrossing. The special effects are fine. The ""story"" is a realheart-breaker and tear-jerker. I continue to re-view it for the pureentertainment. Has some great characters. Besides, we get to lookat Liv Tyler a lot. Probably not 5 stars. Four in my book. I gaveit an extra star because I think it's been panned too severely."
1,Swill,Anyone who cried at the end of the movie is an emotional cripple who I wish I could manipulate in some way.
1,This movie just was too boring and long!,The movie was so boring I actually fell asleep in the middle of the movie. But I the end it finally got a little exciting.
3,Someone should give the editor a sedative....,"Usually when A Criterion Collection movie is produced, it's of a classic and important film. This film is hardly a classic, and I guess it's important only if you count its domestic gross.This movie is fun, but the story is week. There are way too many special effects that by the end of the movie, you are numb to them, and you don't even blink when an asteriod hits France. The editing is also too fast, and the camera is too shakey.This movie will satisfy action fans, but the story is overly patriotic, and the editing needs valium."
1,Why? Why did Criterion do this?,"Criterion says that they do ""important"" films. This film is about as important as speck of dirt. If they're going for ""worst movie ever"" importance, then why not do Plan 9 instead?"
5,based on a true story ...,"... that the IRS covered up in the 90s. The astronauts came back from the mission and then they started dying under mysterious circumstances so they wouldn't talk. I can't get in to how I know this, you'll just have to trust me. I might even be putting myself in jeopardy by revealing this. Hold on a second while I get the door, there's someone banging loudly and shouting my name. Man, sounds like there's a whole squardon of them. LOL. Be right back ..."
2,Typical Jerry Bruckheimer special,"Jerry Bruckheimer has proved to us that with filmmaking like this, Armageddon really is here. We're doomed.To enjoy this film you need to check your brain at the door and just really assume that anything is possible. It also helps if you're a very emotional person that can get lost in feelings quite easily. Unless you're wrapped up with the whole end of the world thing and not thinking rationally, you're going to find many holes in the plot, actors (some of them good) struggling with bad material and special effects done to the point where it just makes you sick. What I really enjoyed about this film was how clever Jerry Bruckheimer was to keep the ""action"" and ""plot"" (terms used very loosely) so fast paced and hard to follow that you didn't even notice that he totally avoided even trying to realistically simulate the conditions of space (or anything else for that matter).A worthy film for masochists."
1,why criterion?,"Of all the great films that Criterion has put out, I was wondering why on earth they did Armaggedon. Okay let's see, ""Seven Samurai, Last Temptation of Christ, Do the Right Thing, The Third Man, Grand Illusion, Henry V,...Armaggedon?"" Which one does NOT belong? I can understand ""Chasing Amy"" more, but PUUULEEESSEE. I've heard ""The Rock"" is also coming out on Criterion. It's a little better than Armaggedon, but not worthy to be among the other great films mentioned. Michael Bay must be slipping them some money under the table."
3,Rollicking Action and no Plot,"All right I enjoyed the action and the special effects were definitely fun. The plot was that of a space western including the jumps over the arroyo. Taken in this light it is good entertainment and great computer work. Perhaps the best to date with seamless integration of effects. On the other hand do not let reality intrude too much as the physics, chemistry and geology is something only a magician could love. The crew matches the science - ie improbable. Blast em Buck Rogers their still squirm'in"
5,You Have To Ask What My Comment Is???,I totally wish I'd of seen it in the theatres!! This going to be the best movie EVER!!!!!
4,It could happen,"To start off with, Can it Happen ? probably. Alot of people I spoke with said ""The movie is far-fetched"" I reply, ""we never had it happen so who really knows how the world would react to solve it or stop it"" My personal thoughts about the movie is INCREDIBLE. The special effects, the acting, and two people ( Willis & Afflect ) putting their diffrences both proffesionaly & personal aside. The script was well written Though I do imagine that if it were to happen for real, I think the men would be more assertive and less screwing around. No one can dispute the special effects, They alone were outstanding. The Acting, You have such diverse group of people all with diffrent personalities and yet they all work as a team. I enjoyed the movie very much and purchased it for my collection. As a big fan of Sci-Fi, Armageddon fits right in."
3,"Short on brains, long on action","No, Captain, there's no sign of intelligent life here, but who really cares? As far as action, special effects, histrionics, clever (but not too clever) humor, this film packs a punch. Sure, you notice it's none to bright, but the characters and the action are so entertaining that it really doesn't matter. Keeps ya from being bored!"
3,"good plot, but overall disappointed","while I liked the graphics, and I thought the performance by the actors and actresses were excellent, I have to say that overall I was disappoited with this movie. first of all, it reminded me too much of Deep Impact, and second of all, i couldn't understand why when something was fixed, (after it had gone wrong), something else went wrong. that happened way too many times for me. And although Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, and Bruce Willis are extremely talented, I thought their actions were way too predictable and so was the ending of the movie. Regrettably, this is not one video going in my collection."
1,Eye-candy for easy-to-please movie-goers,"This movie is perhaps one of the purest examples of producers knowing exactly what formula will draw in huge box-office activity from mainstream movie-goers.... A big budget, big names, and big explosions. The fact that the creators of Amageddon weren't ""big"" on the actual story or the characters doesn't seem to matter.And why should they care? It's obviously much easier to make a bad movie than it is to make a good one. Why subject themselves to the extra stress? Just throw in some popular good-looking actors, and make sure the camera captures sweat running down the sides of their faces while the American flag is blowing in slow-motion behind them. Mix in a lot of pyro and loud music and you have yourselves a winner!"
1,one of the worst movies of 1998,"Terrible acting, directing, and script. Everybody in this ""movie"" overacts terribly.The ""emotional"" scenes are so terribly overdone (with terrible dialogue) that it's hard to watch - just like the rest of the movie. This movie will give you a headache, not just because of the terrible performances and script but the camerawork - it's constantly moving! Almost all the cuts last only a few seconds at best! This movie is more stupid and meaningless than most action movies, mostly because it tries to fool the audience into thinking there is more there than there actually is - absolutely nothing! ""Armageddon"" is a movie to be hated with immense passion."
4,Just a Plain Fun Movie,"This was one of those movies you cannot take with a grain salt but you will have a good afternoon or evening just sitting on the couch watching. I give it four stars for the great cast and amusing script, and for the fact it is a great ""first date"" movie. BUY IT!"
5,Armageddon was such an exciting film!!!,"The movie armageddon was a tear jerking but amazing movie.It kept me on the edge of my seat and was full of action.I recommend this to anyone that likes action-packed movies...and most of you do!Bruse Willis is amazing and gives the movie its whole reason for being out on video.So, take my word for it you will not feel that its a wast of time,in fact,its a great way to spend your extra time.Oh,and you will love the music!!!"
1,Worst action movie,I spent 2 hours for nothing.Absolutely boring and perfect for insomaniac 'cause it gave higher effect than 5 sleeping pills!!
1,The Worst Movie Ever!,I would have put Zero. The most unralistic movie I have ever seen. I fast-foward thru most of the movie. The Tristar Godzilla was so much better.
1,Show me the money and I'll bomb comet for you,That's all the whole thing.It's just another bad movie to waste your money.
1,"Poor plot, painful action movie",I think 4th grade student can write a better plot! It's the most boring action movie I've ever seen.
4,Not all film has to be art,"Why can't some people take certain movies for face value? Let's face it, not everything needs to be Citizen Kane or 2001. Armegeddon is a fast food movie that delivers the goods to the core audience it was intended for. It was one of the few movies in the last year where I could justify spending $8 bucks for. If you want something with a little of action, romance and emotion and are able to take it with a grain of salt, this is the perfect flick."
3,Good Popcorn Fun,"It amazes me how people all of the sudden become these dare-I-say predictible ""film critics"" when watching movies like Armageddon. Do you people honestly feel the people behind this film were after the Acadamy Award for Best Picture?Unfortunately, films like these are not taken seriously anymore and should not be compared to gems like American Beauty. They are made for an entirely different purpose: To appeal to our basest entertainment needs and to make money.The action was excellent, the special effects mind-shattering, and the story was fun. And anyone who likes to eat popcorn while watching a movie is sure to enjoy it."
1,What the hell is that?,"I've never seen a mess like that, poor acting, unrealistic but fortunatelly, good specials effects. The script and the actors is for go to the trash. This is so stupid!"
1,"Starts out good,but goes downhill after the first half or so","This film starts out fun,but a while after they land on the asteroid,the fun goes away and the boredom kicks in."
1,Stupid movie for stupid people...,"See above, that's all there is to say about this movie. If you are a stupid person you'll like this stupid film, if you're not, however, you will realize just how stupid it is."
3,a Re-Evaluation,"It's hard to watch any Jerry Bruckheimer Production now, after seeing TEAM AMERICA. You always wind up laughing at scenes, that werent intended to be funny..."
5,Love this movie,"I was missing out not having this movie in my collection, finally looked to see if you had it & was happy to see you did."
4,Its Bruce Willis,"Action, saving the world from destruction, and setting off a big bomb, what else would you expect from Willis. Okay, brain cells are not in demand here. It is entertainment on the lighter side but the characters and special effects are enough to keep the viewer entertained when you just want to sit back and see the good guys save the world. I can suspend realism now and again. I enjoyed this movies, several times now."
5,Armageddon,Great action movie.All the stars were great in this movie.The story was well put together and produce.You wont go wrong with this one.
2,Bruce Willis-movie... oh yeah.,"What have Clint Eastwood, Chuck Norris, Charles Bronson and dearest Bruce Willis in common? Only on expression on their rich and talented actor-faces - and you just have to envy Bruce: how many times did he save the world now? Was it 50? I liked Bruce in just one, ONE, of his many films - Sixth Sence, he actually did a good ""face"" there - and up to recently, for some reason I just can't find, he has been offered many great film-deals - and I'm sure he was paid ""ok"" for Armageddon too, no doubt - Willis is a man I find hard to see as the big actor-star that he actually is, compare him to Sean Penn, Robert De Niro... Well, this is my opinion on him as one of the highest paid actors today anyway, I'm sure he's a nice guy - but I found both he and this movie a total waste of screen+seats in the cinemas around the world - will not ever watch it again - and Ben Affleck doesn't exactly tempt me there either..."
1,WHY DO I GIVE THIS ONE STAR?,"Because Zero Stars is not an option. This film is garbage in the Criterion Collection. I cannot understand why Criterion would put Michael Bay's run-of-the-mill hollywood brainless summer blockbuster movies (Yes they even took on ""The Rock"") on the same page as Fellini, Renoir, Goddard, Hitchcock, Bergman, etc. This is an insult to film as art (which I thought Criterion was dedicated to). And I'm not pretentious, I'm just stating the obvious. Why does Criterion pick up this movie and not other recent movies much more worthy of the Criterion label--Paul Thomas Anderson's movies for example (esp. Magnolia)? Or even Darren Aronofsy's work (esp. Pi)? The list goes on... this is ridiculous!"
1,Overrated,"I really did not like this film. Something supernatural like this happening is not totally un-likely, but the chances are quite slim. Most of this movie was situated tightly on the romance Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck had. The two ""love-birds"" turned this movie into a semi-chick flick movement, when in reality an enormous comet was supposed to wipe out the earth. Michael Bay truly disappoints with this film. His directing style is poor, as he literally believes that an edit every second is the best way to make a film. I don't think it's possible to physically count the number of cuts and explosions in his films within one human lifetime. The guy can't even make a decent movie with the insane budget he gets to work with. Honestly guys, stick to what's worth seeing, which isn't this movie."
1,A Waste of Film,"It's a great title for a movie, but sad to say the story is not there. The plot simply becomes ridiculous and maybe they should have thought about some editing. It runs too long. Liv Tyler is funny in this movie, unfortunately she didn't intend to be. If you like special effects then go with it. It's a popcorn movie, but the world in not any better for this film having been made."
5,"THIS is action, humor, emotion all in ONE","Special effects, heart-warming emotion, adventure, humor, an excellent score by Trevor Rabin--all in one spectacular film! This is definitely a Michael Bay / Jerry Bruckheimer classic. I don't care what the critics say!"
5,On the edge of your seat movie. A must own movie!!!!!!!!,"There is plenty of action & story to this movie to keep your attention. The music is also wonderful, however I'm a really big Aerosmith fan. This is a must own movie. You won't be dissappointed with this one."
1,A Dolby Digital Nightmare,As a lover of all movies I expect a bad plot when the title is Armagedeon. That way I am surprised if it is actually good. As an audiophile DVDs offer a higher level of quality. This DVD has perhaps the worst sound I have ever heard. The tracks are unbalanced and the explosions are normalized to match the voices. When I buy a DVD like this I expect a higher standard. I didn't recieve one. -5 out of 5!!!!!
1,Very Very Bad!,"I watched this movie, and it was the worst way to spend 2 hours!!! It was so fake how they would send oil drillers instead of astronauts, required only 2 weeks of training, and how they could only find it 18 days in advance. I reccomend you don't buy this movie, because it stinks! The movie just keeps going on and on and on!"
1,STUPID!!!,"This movie has got to be the stupidest movie I've seen since Con Air!! Bad acting, stupid plot, and cheesy love scenes. The one good thing this movie had going for it was the Aerosmith song, but then the radio started playing it over and over and over!!!!!! Now I'm sick of the song and I can barely watch the movie all the way through. Save yourself some time!!!!"
1,Everything about this movie is bad!!!!,"I rented this movie last weekend and boy was I disappointed. The plot is terribly unbelievable, acting is lame, and the script is juvenile. I think someone has to remind the makers of this film that they need something other than special effects to make a good movie. Also, why do we constantly have to listen to boring Aerosmith songs throughout this film????"
1,A hideous FLOP!,"It's like some American action-movie producers only rely on marketing and advertising nowadays. This film was well advertised, the trailer looked ok and the casting seemed to be very good. But that's not enough, this film is really Pathetic, the story is so hideous and unrealistic that I wonder how they could come up with such a pageantry. THIS FILM JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE!!!"
1,This movie was terrible!!!!,Pretty much summed up by the subject line but I can complain more about the poorly written and even worse acted movie I saw all year. I like Bruce Willis and Steve Buschemi in other movies but this was rotten and anyone who liked it has nothing to contribute to real life. Rent Deep Impact it gets 3.5 stars.
3,AWESOME,I have to say this is one of Bruce Willis' best movies. He showed the rough and tough side of his character but when the cards were down he showed the soft side of his character very well. Well worth watching.
1,armageddon needs another ending....,Where hypothetically the earth beings aren't saved at all.One of the worst movies I've forced myself to watch.I wonder if storyline may actually fit truth of our state on this planet.
1,What went wrong?,"Some people that enjoyed this movie may get mad when reading this, but remember, its just my opinion....How did this get in the theaters!? Are we going mad!? This was so FAKE that it was unbarrable! Lets actually think about this movie for a minute:-An asteroid is heading for earth--that can and most likely will happen.-NASA wants to split it in two with a nuclear warhead--ummmm...that's a little far-fetched, but it ""may"" be able to accomplish.-Send an oil digging team to the asteroid to drill a hole and place a nuke in it--No. Can't be done.This movie was made just for entertainment. No logic was used. People talk about the great sound-track in the movie, and I think it is nothing special. In fact, I can't take anyone of that darn Aerosmith song they play on the radio all the time from the movie!! I like those old James Bond movies better than this! So I conclude by asking, ""What went wrong?"""
1,The worst movie I have ever seen,"Why can't I give it negative stars? Whew! I had heard this was a bad movie but I coudn't think it could be as bad as everyone said. Lord in heaven I WAS WRONG!!!!!! Ask my friends, I've thought some pretty crummy movies were good, I let things slide a lot, but this was painful it was so bad. I actually got a headache after the 57th cliche, and we weren't even half done. Not one original line, shot, idea, characterization in the entire film. I was waiting for Willis' head to appear over the wedding scene nodding in approval. I literally felt queasy after this bomb. The sad thing? Some people actually liked it!!! Some people actually CRIED!!!!! 200 million dollars this toxic pile grossed. We the viewing public must truly be cattle, and I am sad to be a part of such a dumb animal."
2,This Movie Could Have Been Better Without Ben!!!,I can't stand to hear Ben Affleck's voice for more than a few minutes but dang this movie went on and on. Sorry but Ben is too childish and just sounds so dumb when he talks...
2,Very stupid movie.,"This movie was a total waste of my time and energy watching it, not to mention the fact that I shelled out twenty bucks for it. The only thing good about this is that Ben Affleck is in it, but even he doesn't make this video worth buying. Save your money; go buy Deep Impact, much better special effects, very interesting. This movie has no plot, nothing interesting worth watching."
2,Lame movie. Great special effects.,"This is one of the lamest movies I have seen. Lame story. Lame acting. Lame actors. Willis at his worse. Tyler should stay being famous because of her father and give up her acting career before we all see how lame she can really be. The only saving quality of this movie is the special effects and they are great. I give it 2 stars based on this fact and only this fact. If you are like me and enjoy watching movies for the sfx then you will like this. If you are deeper and need a good story, pass this one--with a wide gap."
1,Very very bad,"This movie amounted to a lot of flash and bang, but it didn't signify anything. A cheesy Bruce Willis action movie that aspires to greater things is still a cheesy Bruce Willis action movie. Even the romantic aspect of the movie was poorly done. This movie was a pretty poor overall effort."
5,Great Price!,Price was right for this movie. It arrived a little after Christmas but it was OK. Love Amazon!
5,No other Words than GREAT,Great Story line -- amazing movie -- holds you in your seat -- amazing music. There isn't a negative thing to say about this movie. Great movie to see during hard times in life.
2,"Good , Bad and Ugly","Armageddon has it's (small) moments but never really has a plot except blowing up some dallas cowboy meteor. And the 18 days that supposedly is left 'til annihilation is hopelessly inaccurate. Face it, if you want this amount of absurdity, watch WCW. Although it is better than Godzilla."
3,Great DVD of a so-so movie,"This DVD is so chock-full with useful and interesting gadgets and trinkets, it's a real pity that the movie is so incredibly mediocre! The extra stuff is simply astounding: You get to see the making of the movie, its marketing, and the people behind it. That's of course great and informative. However, why do they give Armageddon this treatment - of all movies! For the ""400 Blows"" or for ""M"" this treatment would have been exemplary and extremely laudable, but ARMAGEDDON?! The script drips of cheeze, the acting is bad (in parts only mediocre), the special effects are quite good yet by no means envelope-pushing! Frustrating!"
2,Watch Deep Impact instead.,"This was the MTV version of Deep Impact. Deep Impact was far more realistic, far more dramatic, had far better acting, and was just all in all a better movie. But if you want to watch a movie for the sheer visceral thrill of expensive special effects, this one is for you."
2,Pablum for the Simple Minded,Suspend belief? You'd have to suspend most of your mental faculties not to find this one insulting. Meteors whooshing through the vacuum of space? Not recommended for anyone above the mental age of 8 (nor for any of the brighter 8 year olds!).
2,Why why why....,"I really like Bruce Willis & Steve Buscemi & I was hoping to see a good movie...This one had a good beginning and all but suddenly everything changed. Steve Buscemi was terrible especially when he snapped on that huge rock. All the scenes on that big meteor were terrible. But the end was the worst and the most ""american"" end in the history of films. Perfect Hollywood ending. TWO stars because I like Willis and Liv Tyler was hot as always."
2,Immature. A pure money maker out to capture the box office.,"This movie sets out to do what so many other filmmakers are doing these days: make money, and lots of it. It tries its best to add to an already stale storyline by including a short and precocious love story, but alas, it fails. The special effects are good, which is expected from a potential blockbuster.This movie successfully shoved a sad and weak Deep Impact out of the way to prove to be 1998's best apocalypse/action/fantasy/romance/comedy/wannabee-a-blockbuster-shelfstacker movie of the year. If it weren't for Steve Buscemi's hilarious performance, this video would have garnered only 1/2 star."
2,OK but not that great.,"Story is too contrived, too predictable, and two dimensional. I never got involved in the story or the characters enough to care what happens to any of them. Special Effects are good, though."
1,The worst movie of the summer,"This movie is a compleat insult to my intlegence, and my will to be entertained. Bad acting, worse scripting, and logic flaws you could drop an asteroid through, this movie WILL disipoint. Mr. Bay sould really go back to directing school. I couldn't tell what was going on half the time because the camera moved every two seconds. And why the hell does everything blow up in this movie? I don't know. Maybe one of the ten screenwriters does. Overall this movie is booring and pointless crap. If Amazon.com let me give it 0 stars I would."
2,Blew Chunks,"Quite possibly the worst movie ever!!! Horrible special effects, bad dialog, and a terrible score. Don't buy it!!!"
3,Slick... but dumb.,"If you are one of those lucky people who can suspend ALL disbelief during a movie and check your brain at the door, then you'd probably love Armageddon. It's a reasonably fast-paced action/disaster flick, with some good humor and a great cast. However, if you demand even the tiniest sliver of realism, you'll pass out from hyperventilating at the constant breaking of every rule of physics known to humankind. Also, the character stereotypes get a bit deep at times."
1,Unrealistic and akward,"This movie was sooooo bad. The plot was stupid. Sure, a large asteroid with all of its debris heading towards earth and we can't pick it up on radar or telescopes until the last moment? Come on, who are they kidding? We all know that the solar system is pretty darn stable and we would know way in advance, more like a few years. But all said and done I guess watching this movie would be better than washing the dog or painting the house."
1,ABSOLUTE CRAP!!!,"This movie just shows what's wrong with motion pictures nowadays: All special effects, and no attention whatsoever whether the story is good... Don't get me wrong, I love SFX movies, but I only love those with at least a decent storyline, like T2, or Aliens. Geez... Even the director, Michael Bay, doesn't seem to know what he's doing with this one. Watching this movie, you get the distinct feeling that the guy can't assemble what is usually known as a COHERENT SCENE. This movie blows. I'm sorry I wasted my money to buy a ticket for this piece of crapola..."
1,Unbelievable and Bad!,"First, the plot was pretty unconvincing. I've taken some astronomy courses, and although a meteor could hit earth, I highly doubt that people could land on the meteor, blow it up, and save the world. And if someone were going to save the planet, it would not be people outside the U.S. government who have no experience in space!Second, the love story was pathetic. The movie was so focused on special effects that it never developed the relationships bewteen its characters. The scene where Ben returns and hugged Liv made me cringe. Both were smiling, and I wondered if both the characters had already forgotten the loss of Liv's father and all the trauma they had just been through.And all those set backs out in space? After the twentieth one, you know they're going to live and just want the movie to be over!"
1,Would give it -5 stars,"Nut much to say about this mess of a movie (can this be called a movie?). Bad acting, bad direction, frenetic edition, and no story. And it loooooong. It's offensive to spend all this millions of dollars on films as empty as this."
2,entertaining but predictable,I liked the special effects. It would have been more interesting if the female lead got sent into space while her love interest stayed on earth to worry.
2,Not an amazing Blu-Ray,"NOTE: THIS IS A REVIEW ABOUT THE BLU-RAY release ONLY, not the movie itself.Two words. UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT.It's really only worth a rental.Now on to the detail.The audio track is AMAZING. Very great sounds. The video aged pretty well for a movie that's more than a decade old. Colors are vivid.Now if you wanted this to see Aerosmith in HD, please skip on this. It's in 480i (or P if your blu-ray rolls that way). And aside from the music video, all you get is 2 trailers. THATS IT.If you wanted something that packs a punch in special features, skip this release of Armageddon. If you want an amazing quality of an actually decent Bay film, look no further!"
3,A Great Movie with an interesting look at the making.,"I enjoyed this movie. The original movie was spectacular. If you are thinking of buying this movie for added footage you may want just to buy the normal DVD, but if you want an indepth look on the creation on this movie get this. It has a great gag real and commentary."
1,Worst Movie of 1998 - Bar None,"Cheesy, uninspired disaster flick starring actors who, frankly, should know better: Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, and Billy Bob Thornton. It should come as no shock that this film is a bust; it's brought to us by Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer, the boys who gave us ""Pearl Harbor,"" which may be the worst movie of 2001. I mean, it makes ""Independence Day"" look like ""Saving Private Ryan."" Should you feel the need to watch a disater flick, please by all means avoid ""Armageddon."""
4,"Don't let the snobs convince you this is a lousy movie, it's not.","This is the perfect popcorn movie.The action, the humor, and yes, the emotion. When Liv Tyler cries towards the end, she at that one time enters into the ranks of film's most striking beauties.Yes, the movie is cheesy, but I don't always feel like ""Dinner with Andre"" as a way to relax.One of the reasons the film is hated by the snob elite is because it's a very Patriotic film. And lord knows, you can be chic and think anything about the flag or being a hero is good.Again, most likely you have seen the movie. Go ahead and add it to your library and don't worry about what one of your pretend critic friends might say about you owning it."
1,Not real enough,"I will consider this movie to be too black and white and assume that people are like sheep or cattle. The movie had people behave in predictable ways like line up perfectly on a road when the impact took place in the ocean - in real life the small number of explorer type people will take advantage and then people some more people would take advantage of the opportunities - cars will take advantage of ditches, shoulders, even the opposite lanes. There would be walkers, bicycle, pretty much anything that can move and garbage and stuff would be everywhere. Even the police or the military would have a hard time trying to keep the line neat. Then there's the corny patriotism line of farmers - actually the farms often showed in the media is a rarity - there are not much profit or motivation for younger generations to stay on the farm."
2,Watch Independence Day - it's more believable,"Hey, I like a blow-`em up blockbuster as much as the next person, but please, at least have a story to go with it. Why not just show a bunch of things being blown up and not insult our intelligence. I give this 2 stars for the special effects, there was nothing else."
2,Armageddon not as good as Deep Impact,"Well, not as good as the well written Deep Impact, but probably more entertaining then Deep Impact for the younger viewers.Arm. ***1/2 out of 4 DEEP. **** out of 4"
1,"The WORST science fiction, I mean fiction EVER!","The characters are extxremely flat and the emotion is so pathetic as to be unbelievable. The writing was, well, I can't call that writing. It was typing. But what really got me mad was that Bruckheimer and Co. went way out of their way to make the science absurd. It would have been more interesting if they had stuck to some basis of reality. I have never come to the end of the movie feeling more disgusted in my life and I've seen some pretty bad sci-fi! ""Star Trek V"" was genius compared to this! I know that such a bad review will probably get some people to watch this piece of crud to see what the hub-bub is about. It does come in pretty colors and if that suits you, fine!"
2,Disbelief,I wasn't able to suspend my disbelief during this movie. Nor did I care about the characters. Impressive special effects. That was the only thing that impressed me about this movie. They should have let the asteroid destroy the earth and put us all out of our misery if this is the type of film we are left to watch.
1,Silly plot makes silly movie,"It's a real prove that we can't make good movie from the very,very bad plot no matter how popular stars we have or how much money we spend."
2,Deep Impact is WAYYYY Better!,"Armageddon is a... sci-fi thriller (with big stars), which actually came after the way better and more emotional Deep Impact. Armageddon is basically about the special effects (which are pretty good anyway), and the ending is kind of sad, but it's not as emotional as Deep Impact. The acting is OK, but the plot is stupid! Why would be get drillers and send them to an asteroid to blow it up?! I mean, take some of the most inexperienced astronauts and depend on them to save the world. OK, maybe I'm being a little too much, but if you want a better movie and a better DVD, then I'd recommend Deep Impact."
3,Good action but weak.,Special effects were great. Action was high intensity. Too bad the story had too many faults and was very misogynistic.
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..................,that's about all i did during this disastre.your typical americans try to save the world movie.doesn't any other country try to help save the world?i gave it 2 stars because of steve buscemi and for aerosmith's song.
1,"Oh, brother...","Amageddon stands as a towering example of everything that is wrong with Hollywood these days. This is just an MTV music video expanded into a feature length film. If you have the IQ of a Forrest Gump and the attention span of a fly, you'll probably love it though."
1,Terrible movie.,"This movie has no basis in reality whatsoever. If you want a good sci-fi thriller, see ""Deep Impact"" instead."
1,One of the worst blockbusters of them all...,"I must refer you to the quite poignant comments by the Washington, D.C. customer enterered here earlier on June 30. I couldn't say it better. This movie is simply a step away from a farce. Folks-- just because it sells more tickets doens't make it a good movie. The people that like this drivel are the same folk that call ""Shakespeare in Love"" a best picture. (Shakespeare was a good film, but hardly worthy of the greatest honor--but that's another rant) Try watching a movie that requires the use of your brain."
1,"Slick, Hip and Cool","This film inspired me. . .Seeing something so awful leaves hope that anybody can make a movie. Now I am positive it isn't talent. . .It's who you know.Other than this. . .Should anybody be impressed with this poor excuse of a movie? The writing was embarassing. What plot? Unbelievable characters sounded and acted more like street wise punks recruited to save the world. (Let's face it, this movie was made as an excuse to do special effects).The acting was pitiful, too. Maybe this wasn't the actors fault. Casting couldn't have been any worse. I had never seen such a bunch of miscasts in all my life. That young woman (whose name escapes me like the purpose of this movie does) was not credible at all as the kiss-ass, wise-talking dame she was supposed to be. The words that spewed from the characters mouths were incredibly trite and boring. It's like the filmmakers were into being cool than having a good story to tell.Rate this movie a big, fat zero."
1,Waste of Time,"It is so sad that there were so many great DVD features wasted on this stupid film. I wish they would have put this much effort into the truly great films on DVD like Taxi Driver, Annie Hall, Bulworth, and many more not to mention all the great films not available on DVD at all. Sad comment on what the public watches."
1,Absolute load of crap.,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and since I am studying movies to be a director, I have seen a lot. Here are some creative adjectives I would use to describe this movie: Nauseating, offensive, terrible, rubbish, sad, depressing, catastrophic, foul."
1,A pitifully bad movie,"I am shocked to see ANY positive reviews of this movie. It has a weak plot, poor acting, and abundant cliches. The only redeeming qualities in this movie can be found in the special effects, which were pretty impressive. However, special effects alone cannot help this movie. Don't waste your money!"
1,Amazon should get a 0 star.,"I thought this movie was written & directed by Sean ""Puff Daddy"" Combs because it stole all it's ideas and dialouge from previous films before it! Also, is'nt Bruce Willis getting on your nerves lately, I think Roger Ebert is going to break his wrist from twisting his ""thumbs down"" on practically every movie ol' Bruce is in. I fell asleep in the theartre for about 20 minutes and was awoken by a very loud explosion, at first I was scared the **** out of, then I quikly realized where I was and fell back asleep. I've never left a theatre so well-rested!"
1,What's a shame of sci-fi's story.Just 0 star is not enough,"Did the director know the word called ""Science PHYSIC""?(cann't explain it was so many) Did the director know why the dynosorus was lost from world?(By winter because meteor not a flame from meteor) Did is real that NASA help them to devolop this story? What's a shame that NASA allow the director to release this story! Did the Director know sci-fi is reduce of word called ""science fiction"""
1,What a waste of 2 hours!,"A typical ""Bruce Willis Movie"" packed with boneheaded predictable violent scenes. In Armaggedon, this country's goverment, decides to put the whole worlds faith into the hands of a bunch of idiot dirtball Oilriggers, who according to the movie, didn't even pass high school! Gimme a break! This movie wastes a bunch of time and didn't get to the core plot of saving the world enough."
1,Puh-leez!!!,"Armageddon was the stupidest movie ever. After Ben Affleck narrowly escapes death 50 times in the first 10 minutes, the ending is so predictable. I mean, it got to the point that I actually WANTED him to die!! Plus everything else that could possibly have gone wrong went wrong, yet amazingly they overcome it all. The characters and dialogue were so stupid and the whole story was pointless, and it was completely unrealistic. Besides if those people were really hurling through space after crashing they would have exploded and no one can handle that many G's. If you want a realistic space movie, go get Apollo 13, and if you want a decent movie with Ben Affleck, get Good Will Hunting. Otherwise don't waste your money."
1,a waste of time,"Like most people, I like watching dumb action movies once in a while. I am sorry but, in my opnion, this one was just bad, really bad. There was a lot of action, but I found almost all of it boring. And the transparent attempts made by the director to pull the emotional strings were pathetic. The movie was neither exciting nor moving. I hated this movie with a passion."
5,I love this movie!,"Cheesy? Ok, yes. And I'm the biggest Armageddon fan out there, I'm sure. Is it still my favorite movie? Without a doubt! I'm pretty cynical when it comes to movies, too. I give this movie a 5 because it has all aspects that I love in a movie: action, stars, love and a teary patriotic ending. I agree that Pearl Harbor looks a little TOO similar to Armageddon, especially the end. The girls are practically wearing the same dresses!Yes, I'm sure there are a lot of bloopers, mistakes and aspects that are totally unbelievable, if not disbelievable, but I don't care. I didn't first watch the movie to look for mistakes, or look into my NASA handbook to make sure that everything was to code. I was entertained, and am still entertained even after having watched it dozens and dozens of times.I will admit to anyone who asks that this is my all-time favorite movie."
2,Bruce Willis fans only!,"I don't think anyone would have seen this movie if it wasn't for Bruce being in it. Without Bruce, this movie would have been flat! The story is silly, the acting is sillier. The best part of this whole movie is Aerosmith playing in the background. Just goes to show how a top notch actor and musical talent can change a dud movie into a hit!"
2,rinse and repeat,Fade in. closeup. action. cue music. close up. sentimental. closeup. closeup. action. cue music. close up. sentimental. the end.A typical over the top American movie that shows unity and pride. Ben Afleck desperate tries to be the golden boy and become Bruce's adopted son a la Ashton Kutcher.
1,"if swallowed, induce...","Michael Bay should be taking Ritalin.emptyAlthough, Bruce Willis has rarely looked finer..."
2,Boring,"This movie was too boring! The story was unoriginal and boring. Liv Tyler was annoying in this movie, and the oiler guys had TOO much fun. I would recomend Deep Impact over this."
2,Not as good as it seems,"I thing Armageddon had a good idea when it started, but it went downhill. I think that the movie is too long and drawn out. It would be uch better if it was 2 hours. Also, what the NASA people say would happen if the rock came crashing down to Earth is an understatement. Aswell as the number of nukes it took to blow up the asteroid. 1 nuke do destroy a rock the size of Texas!? It would take a lot more than that. In Deep Impact 4 or 5 did not do the job for a six mile long comet. Also when the two shuttles are flying so close, the egsaust would probly tear parts of the other's hull apart. A good idea, but too long with too many scientific errors."
3,DiViDed!?!,"Usually when watching movies, I try to stay away from the ""THAT COULD NEVER HAPPEN"" thoughts that seem to creep in from time to time.And several scenes did test my will in trying to stay in the ""MINDLESS SHEEP"" mode. This movie had GREAT = special effects and casting GOOD = acting and story POOR = music and realism For those of you who paid to see this movie and hated it, DISNEY THANKS YOU!!! And don't be too hard on yourselves, for it may say more about us ""brainless ones"" who paid and enjoyed this movie than you ""geniuses"" who were suckered into paying to watch this film. AGAIN, DISNEY THANKS YOU!!!(oh yea, NO REFUNDS!!!ha,ha)<<EVERYONE'S ALWAYS TRYING TO BE ""SISKEL""... OR IS IT ""EBERT""...>>"
2,A rank bad movie with good special effects,Armageddon is the latest in the series of sci-fi movies dished out by hollywood every year having thin plots resembling your wildest imaginations anf your scariest dreams. Or else how could one imagine one oil driller and his crew to save the world while only the U.S president and a bunch of smart NASA's seem to be concerned and the whole world is ready to suffer the holocaust. The stars did their best but how much better can one do for such a weak plot. The saving grace are the stunning visuals and breath-taking special effects and to the sound-effects which wouldnt let you have a catnap.
2,Wait for the Criterion edition,"Cross a rock video with a video game and what do you get? Armageddon! Yeah, I was hyped about it at first, but lost interest quickly. Like eating a fat piece of candy just for the sugar high, then you crash hard. Let's let oil drillers save the planet! If you dig this movie, wait for the Criterion Collection- you'll love it. If you hated the DVD, but liked the movie, again, Criterion will do it justice. Otherwise, rent a video game and watch MTV. You won't know the difference."
3,Too many holes and too predictable!,"I expected to see why Bruce Willis was the top dog expert for drilling holes. I don't think anywhere in the movie did it show how he uses his skills. In fact it seemed like he needed plenty of help. Not enough suspense, too predictable, and could have utilized Bruce Willis better. Still I liked the movie which is why I'm giving it 3 stars."
3,Somewhat entertaining...,"Armageddon is definitely not as good as I thought it would be. The acting wasn't very convincing (especially Liv Tylor's) and everything was quite predictable, especially since so many other movies have had the same basic storyline. When will Hollywood come out with something that's action packed and original?"
1,If you are over the age of 15- Skip it.,"An insult to your intelligence. Put together a goup of madcap misfit underdogs. Throw them into space. Have them save the world. Watch their crazy anti-establishment antics in MTV video format!Silly.""Deep Impact"" is a better movie with the same subject matter in the action/adventure genre.But, oh, Armageddon is horrible."
1,Winner of the Most Unrealistic Film Ever Made!,"Warning: Do not watch this movie if you are scientificly inclined. Do not watch this movie if you cannot suspend your disbelief at an asteroid the size of Texas being ""diverted"" from its course when it's less than 20,000 miles from earth (it's a gravitational impossiblility people!). Ok...so it's a fun romp. But don't expect it to inspire your children to become astronauts. More likely they will want to be oil rig workers. Good pay in that."
3,loud and crude this film is so bad that it's fun,"yes it's stupid and if you think about it for a nanosecond itis just beyond unbelieveable and into ""ah, come on guys what are you thinking"" but just like a jock that can't add 2 plus 2 , but plays ball like a god, you have to feel some kind of fun from this loud and just plain dumb action movie where oil drillers are sent into space to blow up an astroid the size of texas to save the world. what more can you say. i liked it even if it is just plain dumb,it's like junk food,watch it and forget it."
1,"Bad story, bad acting, great SFX!","Terrific special effects cannot possibly hope to buoy this dung heap of a movie. Unlike the similarly-plotted ""Deep Impact"", ""Armageddon"" is a shallow, explosives-laden snoozer, featuring too many stars speaking too much cheesey dialogue through too many painfully-scored and acted scenes. I'm not sure what I disliked more, the music video pacing or the ludicrously rubber ""science"" behind this piece of science fiction. Really, don't bother with this one, unless you plan to turn the sound off and enjoy the movie purely on its visual merits. In that department it is a home run. Otherwise, skip it, and go get a copy of ""Deep Impact"". Now there is a truly outstanding asteroid disaster movie."
1,Big Mistake Criterion!,"Ok, so i'm browsing through all the cool really good other movies in the Criterion Collection when suddenly I see Armageddon and i i'm like ""what!!!!???"" This movie was pure hollywood, a big budget film perfectly targeted to make money off of the current audiences and that's precisely what it did. Deep Impact at least had some sort of emotional conflict in it. However, I'm not giving one star to the movie itself, some people love this stuff and its beside me to criticize them, but really I have to give it to the Criterion Collection. I'm sorry Criterion, I usually love your movies and have a whole bunch at home and plan to order many more, but this was not a good choice for an addition to the collection. Many of your other movies are little-known, or ""art-house"", or simply clever and original in some way, little adjectives I refuse to assign to this.P.S. I have to thank the reviewer Fat Jon or whoever, I hadn't realized the ""metaphor"" of ""space cowboys"" before! J/K"
1,Bad Bruce strikes again,"Sorry, but I have to list this as one of the worst films I have ever seen. I enjoy action movies (even bad James Bond films) as much as the next person but I was cringing at the dialogue, the acting, the cardboard, macho posturing, the cheesy music score, the one-dimensional characters (does Liv Tyler do anything but look vague and pouty?). This is one of those Bad Bruce movies. You know, there's the good Bruce (The Sixth Sense) and then there's......this."
4,Never a dull moment,"Bruce is not one of my favorites and the concept is a bit hokey. That said, prepare yourself for a pretty good film. Special effects are superb and there is a more than a few warm moments. The ending is predictable but still very touching."
5,Great action-adventure movie,"This is one of my favorite action-adventure movies of all time. For one thing, you have Bruce Willis in a role that could have been created with him in mind: arrogant, cocky, inflexible, and the best driller in the world. Throw in a group of equally skilled misfits and a love story subplot between Ben Affleck and Bruce's daughter, and non-stop action with killer special effects and a soundtrack to match, and you've got a great evening's entertainment.The plot is simple: a killer meteor is heading toward Earth, and Bruce and his crew of drillers are sent to drill a hole in it, drop in a nuclear device, and detonate it as they speed back home.The visual effects are quite good, and the audio is outstanding, with excellent use of the subwoofer and the surrounds to create an entire sound environment. For action/adventure fans, this movie is essential."
1,The worst movie ever,This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. It does not have a single redeaming quality. Not even the special effects are good enough to make this movie worth seeing. It is real trash.
1,Terrible,"Special effects aside, this is an example of Hollywood at its worst. I'm not sure, but I think the writers of this film were purposely writing the corniest lines in the history of movies. (Maybe as a joke, to demonstrate how stupid and shallow American audiences have become) Great special effects, but after 20 minutes, who cares?"
1,"CAUTION - This move is not Armageddon, it is ""THE ROCK""","This is a streaming problem with this selection. You will not be receiving Armageddon, but rather, The Rock with Nick Cage."
5,"""One Of The Best Disaster Films""","Budgeted at $140,000,000, ""Amageddon"" was one of the most costliest disaster epics Hollywood has ever made. Released only a few months after another disaster film ""Deep Impact"", ""Armageddon"" deals with the fact that a giant asteroid is on a collision course to earth and it is up to a group of deep core drillers working for NASA to stop the dreaded outcome. Extremely well-produced with top-notch special effects and a cast of some of Hollywood's best actors including Bruce Willis, ""Armageddon"" would go on to be the top grossing film of 1998 and gross nearly $600,000,000. It was also one of Michael Bay's first films in which he directed, and the success of ""Armageddon"" would allow Bay to direct many remakes of former Hollywood horror films like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Fog"".The movie is well known for the song ""I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing"" and its video is included in the bonuses of the DVD along with the trailer."
4,#1 Popcorn Flick Of 1998...,"Armageddon was the most amazing thrill ride I was on all summer and it was cheaper than Six Flags. Sure, it's a formula popcorn flick, so don't expect any profound performances but with an incredible score and visually stunning eye-candy (Liv Tyler) you'll be in for quite a treat. Oh, and the special effects are alright too."
4,Major Tear Jerker,"This movie was completely wonderful. There were a few moments when the movie lacked reality, but the special effects and actors were great. It is a great date movie."
5,"A predictable, yet enjoyable movie!! Loved it!!","Okay, I realize that it could have been better, but no one can write that they didn't laugh when Bear sang ""Leavin' on a Jet Plane"" or when the drillers asked never to pay taxes...ever again... It's fun for the whole fmaily, a great showing by Willis, Affleck, Tyler, and Thorton. Two thumbs up!! I highly recommend it for Affleck-lovers, kids, adults, everyone!! It mixes action, sci-fi, comedy, and romance."
1,Tired of watching America saving the world one more time,"How many more times do we have to see the US gloriously saving the world? It's just so not original. Will Bruce Willis ever shave? Ben Aflek can not act, so can't Miss Taylor. BTW, do you still think America won the world war 2?"
4,I enjoyed the movie and the love story in it.,This movie had a great love story. I felt as if I was there and this was happening to me and mt family. I still cry every time I see it. Just to let you know I have seen it a total of thirteen times.
3,Armageddon,"O.k. movie, with an non-believable plot and silly premise, but the special effects are absolutely staggering. I pumped this movie through a Dolby Digital, six speaker surround system and this was the only saving grace. I gave it 3 stars simply for the FX.P.S. Steve and Liv Tyler REALLY do look alike."
2,typical american disaster movie,It's not good at all. The only good actors is Peter Stormare and Ben Affleck. If you want to see a better asteroid movie watch Deep Impact
5,"this great movie is not only thrilling, its got character",armageddon is a movie one can watch over and over and still be affected by it. its got life. the actors do a great job of making the feelings come to life... making them feel real. when you watch this you get sucked into it and you almost feel like its really happening
5,This movie was one of the years best,"This movie was so great that I had to see it twice in the theater, and I've owned it for only a week, and I've seen it 5 times. I'm so afraid that my video will get fuzzy. The action was unbelievable, and the plot was excellent. Some people say that it was dumb because it had too many things break down, but I beg your pardon, that's the reality of life. This movie was the best I've seen in along time. I want to commend the whole cast. This was a brilliant piece of work."
4,Overall Armageddon is a wonderful movie.,"Armageddon is a great combination of romance, action, human drama, comedy, and a bit of science fiction. It combines an amazing cast with loveable characters, a realistic storyline, and exceptional special effects."
1,michael Bay's work = cheese,"When I think of Michael Bay's work I think cheesyness, same content, and his postcard scene looks. The action is really boring, and u already know whats gonna happen. I can go on and on but the one star says it all. Peace"
1,Good Special Effects,"Not the worst movie i have ever seen but certainly close to it. The movie has some nice special effects but the story to me is just stupid. Every chance they get, they cut to some scene of children running around or people all together laughing and that helps us to realize the significance of the events taking place in the movie but they orver do it WAY too much! Every 10 seconds they cut to an unrelated scene with some kids playing with animals or something to that effect. I got sick of them trying to make this movie much more emotional then it should be. Otherwise the basic plot is good and some nice outerspace special effects."
1,Dull....,"Sorry,but no tear for Armageddon.It's so dull and boring.I wasted money(thank god,it's only $3 for renting not $7 in cinema nor $16 for vdo) and I mean WASTE."
3,John Wayne lives again through Willis.,"It has been awhile since we have seen a John Wayne type of hero. It's refreshing to see a hero put his family and country before his own interests. Granted the movie has some flaws but with the all-star cast, excellent soundtrack and edge-of-the-seat-excitement it is well worth the ride and the dollars for entertainment."
5,The ultimate save the world hero movie. B****y amazing.,"I saw this movie 3 times, and it remains my favorite movie in a long while. I've always liked the idea of ordinary people being called upon to save the world, and when I heard about the plot to this film I knew I had to see it. Who cares if the plot is not a complicated as other movies. Not all movies are great for the same reason. To me this movie was great because it UNASHAMABLY (did I spell that right) promotes camaradre, heroism, great sacrifice and a single minded determination to save lives. As far as being accused of being a 'God bless white male America' movie, in my opinion, and my opinion may not be right for everyone, the movie was not intended to insult anyone. I'm British, I saw the movie 3 times at the cinema, and enjoyed it more each time. I WAS NOT OFFENDED. I don't think any offense was intended. As for the humour, did I laugh? I nearly cried I was laughing so much. An exaggeration I know, but I can't praise this movie enough."
1,I'd give it zero stars if it was an option,Possibly the worst movie ever made. Watching this film is like watching a two hour long commercial/music video. There is not one single redeeming quality about the film.
4,Awesome movie,"The opening sequence to this movie is really good and gives a good setup for the disaster it mentioned that has happened will happen again. However, this time, the dominant species of the planet is smart enough to stop the asteroid from hitting Earth, though they have a slim chance and have to be really careful. Good combination of action and drama make for a rather memorable movie, and the cast of actors did a great job in their roles, in my opinion. Definitely worth watching at least once."
4,Excellent Movie !,"If you have not yet seen this movie, please ignore the negative reviews. See it for yourself and decide. This movie has incredible special effects, and very believable actors. I would have given it 5-Stars, but I reserve those ratings for movies such as ""American Beauty"", ""The Insider"", etc.Still, Armageddon is an excellent apocolyptic thriller."
1,This is one awful film,"I do not understand why so many people love this film. I know of no other movie in which absolutely no one acts or speaks like actual human beings. If you are forced to suffer through it, notice how everyone speaks in sound bites followed by an edit. I also really wonder how it took Bruce Willis and Liv Tyler so long to get to Washington in order to be briefed on the asteroid, but in the same amount of time, all of the riggers were able to travel the globe. I could go on and on about the implausibility of the film's ""plot,"" but why bother. You'll just have to trust me when I say that I would rather gaze into a full toilet than be sickened by watching this awful mess again."
1,Crap! CRAP! UTTTER CRAP!!!,"Boom, Bang, Ben, and BRUCE! A new film has dethroned Batman and Robin as the worst film of all time!"
1,WORST EVER!!!!,This movie had bad actors and an obvious ending. Of all the great movies and acting Bruce Willis has done this is his absolute worst!! Don't waste your time or money on this movie.I would have given it a 0 but this is as low as I could go.Arm. 0 out of 5 Deep. ***** out of 5
2,I'm just glad I didn't pay to see it,"""Armageddon,"" directed by Michael Bay, marks a new low in sci-fi/action cinema. The film tells the story of an oil drilling crew, led by Bruce Willis, which is recruited to blast off into space in order to help stop a killer asteroid from destroying the earth.The story is both stupid and unbelievable. The script is full of cheesy, embarrassingly unfunny attempts at humor. The obligatory romance between Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler is a waste. The action sequences are far too loud and chaotic; they seem like something conceived by hyperactive 4-year olds. And ultimately, the film goes for cheap, manipulative sentimentality, rather than believable emotion.""Armageddon"" is not a total waste. The hard-to-swallow story at least held my attention. And Steve Buscemi (in a supporting role) has a few fun moments. But overall, this is a disappointing film."
1,Wow this movie is stupid!,"What is Armageddon? Well Wrap your head in an American flag, loop ""dont wanna miss a thing"" by Arrowsmith at full volume, and have a friend poke both your eyes and box your ears.. there you have it"
1,Five-star movie...,"Hey, count it correctly. The previous reviewer gave it five stars, one star per review."
2,prodducton not upto- date,although the movie was good but I think it would not earntoo much of people attraction
1,"very LOUD, very FAST, bought a ticket, should have passed...","I was disappointed, very disappointed. I'm glad all of the trailers for ""coming attractions"" appeared before the movie instead of after or I might not have been able to hear them. Made a lot of money, sure. Summer blockbusters, name of the game, I guess. Very patriotic to die on a meteor about to blow up the earth. All that and Buscemi aching for a booty call. ""Killer soundtrack""? Sure, it killed my ears. I guess this was a movie you either loved or loathed. I don't remember seeing any 3-star reviews."
5,Vote for Adding this film to Amazon Instant Video for Prime Members,This is a great movie and I would love to see it available for streaming for Prime Members. Just thought I'd add a blurb.
5,MANKIND FACES IT'S GREATEST THREAT.,"ARMAGEDDON IS A MOVIE THAT COMES ALONG ONCE IN A WHILE BECAUSE THE STORY LOOKED SO REVEALING. BRUCE WILLIS AND BEN AFFLECK ARE REALLY ASTOUNDING ACTORS AND THE EMOTIONS THAT THEY PORTRAYED IN THIS MOVIE WAS JUST BRILLIANT. THE ACTION WAS WONDERFUL AND EVERY ACTOR HAD A ROLE THAT WAS RIGHT FOR THEM. OVERALL, ARMAGEDDON DESERVES GOOD CREDIT BECAUSE IT SHOWS YOU THE LOVE, HONOR, AND SACRIFICE THESE MEN HAD TO MAKE FOR THEIR COUNTRY. THEY WERE NOT CALLED HEROES FOR NOTHING."
3,Amageddon,My son liked it. It made a good Christmas gift for him.It was shipped on time and was in good shape.
3,ok movie,"I thought this movie was alright, but right after deep impact came out bam this comes out. Same story meteor is headed for Earth, and a rogue band of oil miners from the middle of the Atlantic are going to save the world? Maybe this meteor was the size of Texas whoooo im shaking i guess deep impact's meteor wasn't big enough for them? But all in all i guees this movie was enjoyable."
4,BEN AFLECK STINKS!!!!!,"DON'T GET ME WRONG, I LOVED THIS MOVIE EXCEPT FOR ONE THING, BEN AFLECK. I LOVE THE IDEA OF BRUCE WILLIS, LIV TYLER, AND BILLY BOB THORTON BEING IN THE SAME MOVIE BUT BEN AFLECK COME ON! HE HAS TO BE THE WORST ACTOR OF ALL TIME. JUST BECAUSE OF BEN AFLECK THIS MOVIE GETS 4 STARS INSTEAD OF 5."
4,Good disaster movie.,Fairly good story but rather unbelievable. Quite little extra goodies but I hope that the movie companies start adding some extra information on the dvd's.
5,i loved it soooooo much!!,"oh my god... 'Armageddon' was such a wonderful movie!! i should have seen this in theater!(i watched at home..) this movie made me concentrate from the begining to the end! 'Armageddon' was much better than those cheesy 'Titanic' stuff.. anyways, you really gotta see this movie~~"
4,Great Movie,Armageddon is a really great movie. It is definitely Michael Bay's best movie (I'm not sure how he went wrong with Transformers). The blu-ray conversion was well done. It looks really good. The disc also has some standard additional features which are good to watch.
