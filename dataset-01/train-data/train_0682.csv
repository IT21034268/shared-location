4,Magnificent Bach played to perfection.,"Nothing about J. S. Bach's organ pieces were standard fare. Few if any of them were actually written for church services. They were written for himself and for other musicians. They are far to long and chromatic to be useful for service. Bach was often critizised by the church eldars for writing noisy difficult music that was too distracting for their congregations.You can well understand when listening to this disc indeed. It includes a fair cross sample of much of Bach's music for organ, from transcriptions of Vivaldi, to the fantastic ""Great"" fugue in g minor which ends the CD.All played wonderfuly by David Higgs, on the organ of the Bryn Mawr Presbyterian Church in Pennsylvannia. Recorded in stunning sound by Delos. Very recommended if you want to know what Bach's organ music was about, or if you simply want to hear the g minor fugue played about as well as can be it can possibly be played."
4,respect it,"It's been two years that I waited celly cel album, having no news from him since he did not appeared on the latest sick wid it releases, so I wa quiet disspointed before listening this album but now I can tell U one thing : this album is dope too. All the songs have a bay area flava, celly cel keeps his orginal flow and there are less guets than in the g filez and that's better. few guests are Dub C, kurupt and young bleed and all did their jobs. THis album reminds me ""killa kali"" but with a more introspective and serious celly. That's the G filez best album."
4,Don of The Bay,The Album bumps as usual and Celly seems more comfortable with lacing the album with more of his vocals instead of alot of guest appearences. My favortie track is number 10. But i like alot of them and it's a very satisfying purchase. I'd advise you this is one of his best ones yet.
3,The least good of many from Tony Scot,A disappointment. Too arranged too boring. No one seems up to usual standard. A few good numbers for sure. But there are several very good albums to chose between with the incredible Tony Scott. Do not chose this if you look for Mr. Scott
4,a closed backed conundrum,"the problem that I have with close backed slippers is the support system(or the lack of it) in the heel.Afer three weeks of use (and mostly walking on rugs) the shoe heel(left) loses its structure and my foot begins to hit on the side of the shoe and after a time the side of the slipper becomes the distorted impact point. Maybe it is the rug surface, or my gait,but every closed back I have tried the same thing happens.As for woolrich mammoth slipper,for the price you cannot go wrong unless you have my particular problem with closed back slippers.(the inside lining could be more comfortable but not enough to subtract more than (1) star from the overall presentation."
5,Changes to come,"This book really made me ask the hard questions. I am 22 years old and I can see a lot of what she has said in reguard to children and how they are raised, which leads to inmuture and unnurtured children becoming unnutured and imuture adults it a cycle that must end.I am still processing the information in this book, and wondering where do I begin, what steps do I take to make a change. This book is a gateway, it makes you see what we have done as creators who have not taken responsiblity for what we have created,It gives me knowledge and hope.It is a bridge from detruction and ignorance to balance and creation with nature in all its forms. Which will we choose? I highly recommend the time and effort that this book will take to read, not because it is a hard book but because it will take many readings to grasp and assimilate the information, it really is something you must re-read as many times as it takes to reinforce the beautiful lessons it teaches."
2,Not for younger children,"I didn't realize this book of stickers was for older kids (should have read the reviews first) and found that dd did not like this book at all. She is almost 3. She loved other books, but not this one - the pictures (e.g, bugs in jello) didn't make sense to her."
1,NOT THAT GREAT,"My girls love stickers. I was disappointed. There are not that many in the book, and it is very thin. Not the HUGE book I expected. My kids will be through this in an hour tops. I bought it for a plane ride. Looks like I will be ordering more."
5,Fantastic!,"My 4 year old got this book last Christmas, but just rediscovered it. He loves it! He has been using it several times a day for a week and is almost out of stickers!"
4,For older kids,"Ok sticker book, just a little too much and some stickers too little for little kids. Think this would be good for proyects though."
3,"Great idea, sticker quality not so good.","Loads of great, fun stickers in this book, but we found they weren't properly 'cut out' so it was difficult to get them off the page and several ripped. My kids were very frustrated. Perhaps just a faulty copy?"
1,didnt like it at all,"i have buy sticker books used but this one was in a bad condition almost the half of the stickers of the book were used, how im i supposed to give tha o my little cousin?i wasted my money"
1,quilt book,this book is not what I expected it would beI have donated it to a charityI hope someone will be able to use it
1,10 minutes of reading the paper will get you more informatio,"Waste of money, as you can probably tell by everything from the title to the author's bio, to the fact that you never heard of him before, to the fact that the book is tiny. I wish I'd read Newsweek and donateed this money instead of buying this book."
1,Avoid - waste of money,"I saw the author on tv and wrote down his six elements for preparing for an emergency. I should have stopped there. There is nothing else of value in his book, and his six elements are rudimentary. Since he gave them on tv, I'll give them here so you can save your money: 1. Establish a network 2. Designate a team leader 3. Prepare a detailed contact list 4. Establish a command post 5. Choose a rendevous point 6. Pick a safe haven. I was already doing most of these, I just didn't call them what he calls them.I also agree with the other reviewers who state that this book was hastily put together to monopolize on the events of 9/11/01. The information on types of threats is simplistic to say the least. This book was a big disappointment."
5,Granddaughter loved this book,"My 6 year old granddaughter is into cooking and wants to be a chef in France when she gets older. I thought this would be a great book for her and, thankfully, it was. She loved the concept of the book and the great cake Jake bakes. She loved the book and I would recommend it highly."
5,Had it memorized,"Our family read and recited this book ""one more time"" every night for a long time when my three kids were young. Our copy is tattered and i'm replacing it and stocking up for (future) grandkids. Though i don't want to handle the damaged pages any more, i can still tell you that the bridesmaids' roses tickled their noses and the ushers' ties were all the wrong size. But cover your ears when Mrs. King begins to sing!"
3,Hitler - a study of ..,Another of a line in study of out of control power that changed the world. A study of Hitler that contributes to the greater picture of governmental agents of change.. Study with opinions.
2,Useless Readings,Book is pretty useless. Doesn't correlate to the lectures that well. Problems are overly complicated but help to understand concepts of they are completed.
5,A Must Read,"This is a MUST READ for any business leader serious about competing for the best of employees and the best of customers, for the long term. Joe Phelp's concept of ""self-managed, client-based teams in a full feedback environment"" is applicable to virtually every company aspiring to be great. Done the way Joe suggests in this compelling book, it can be powerfully effective both in creating the kind of organization you want to run, with the people you want working at their best, and in attracting and keeping the kind of customers you want--to everybody's benefit.Ann Graham Ehringer, PhDVisiting Professor, Trinity College, Univ. of Dublin, IrelandFormer Professer of Entrepreneurship, Univ. of Southern Calif.Business Owner, Independent Board Member and Business Coach"
4,Chaney Alarm Clock,"I purchased the Chaney Alarm clock because no wind up alarms are available in this area. I checked the other reviews about this clock and found the majority gave rave reviews. I kept the clock in a warm 70 degree room for several days and it kept perfect time but when I put it in our bedroom where the temp this time of year is around 55 or 57 degrees, it lost a couple of min in 2 days. Other wise I am perfectly satisfied with my purchase."
1,Don't Waste Your Money...,I really was looking for a simple wind up clock and based on reviews of all on Amazon I choose this one. Don't waste your money. At first trying out I wound it up and then about 3 hours after letting it run it dies. Yes it dies...I was like you have to be kidding me...I know I did not over-wind it and I set everything properly. It is a windup clock how much more simpler can you get. I had to tap it to get the hands working again and again and again. It worked one time for me and then died. The cheap leg on the clock fell off and the bell didn't ring when it was suppose to. I had high hopes to have a simple wind up clock and this was not it. I will not buy any other windup clock either. If China manufactures can't get this simple technology right is just goes to show the poor quality of the material that went into this product....it needs to be removed as an item for Amazon!
5,Play Therapy: The Art of the Relationship,This is an excellent primary text or personal reference for gaining a thorough and balanced overview of play therapy. It not only covers the theory behind play therapy but also contains the practical nuts and bolts of how to do play therapy and what items are helpful in doing play therapy. I use this as the primary text in a course I teach called Counseling the Distressed Child. I highly recommend this book if you were to only get one book on play therapy.
5,My birds are so happy,I purchased this toy for my 4 parakeets. While initially scared of it (this is normal for them with any new thing introduced into their cage) it didn't take long for them to hop over to check it out. Since that time they have spent a lot of time preening the toy and pulling the paper wrapping off of the wooden blocks. I will definately be purchasing more of these once they have finished with this one.
5,NOT BORED!,"Great disc by Budgie that I am proud to finally add to my CD collection. The band continues to rock in what would prove to be their final studio CD, although I would still like more! As always Budgie fills a disc with excitement and fun. Great tunes in this are ""Bored With Russia"", ""Don't Cry"", ""Give Me the Truth"", and ""Allison"". Get this....there's even a string ensemble on ""Flowers in the Attic"", which by the way is my favorite from this disc. It's amazing to listen to everything out by Budgie again on CD finally and still not understand why they never broke over the top. Don't wonder, pick this up, or, cry when it is no longer available and one of your friends plays it for you!"
1,The worse 2 albums by Budgie,Deliver us from Evil and Last Stage are 2 two worst albums by Budgie. It's a wonder how their music can degenerate of this awful level.
4,I love garfield and I love monopoly!,"This game is so adorable. It is educational for kids, as always for monopoly there is always math included in there. Plus with the twist of the theme of Garfield in there, it's hilarious! If you love monopoly, and you love garfield, this is it!"
3,Nice variation of the standard game,"The game is based on the original monopoly, But with the Garfield twist, Children find it much more entertaining, Creating an enjoyable evening with the family"
3,Ford Pick-Ups 1965-86 (Chilton's Total Car Care Repair Manual),"This book had some good information, but it wasn't quite what we were looking for. We needed more detailed information about the fuel system, diagrams, schematics, etc. This was very generalized information."
1,very little info for 65,if you have a older ford truck pass this book up. no info worthreading here for my 1965. example no 4x4 breakdown for the 65hayes book is much better
3,Its what we wanted,"It was the correct book, not damaged though it was used so all in all a good deal besides them leaving the sticker price on it showing that back in the day (or whenever) they bought it was for less then half we paid. That was a little upsetting but for all the use it gets it was still worth what we paid."
1,No info for fuel injected 86 f150,Should have saved the money. Chiltons has always been the worst manual available. Not sure why I went against my experience. Book was in good shape though.
4,A new twist!,"This is a great song, but it's a bit diffrent from the other songs that I've heard from them. This comes from the new album, Warning. It kind of sounds like an Irish drinking song. They did a good job, but it's lacking the stuff from the other albums. Buy it if you'd like to hear a new twist from Green Day, because it really is good."
3,Not Jamie's Best Work,"I have read all of Jamie Langston Turner's novels--she is my favorite Christian author--and this is the only one I have just really NOT liked. The story moves at a snail's pace and the story keeps changing venues and time frames, going from past to present, and the reader is left VERY confused. Also, there are umpteen references to poetry and poets and how they relate to things happening in the narrator's life, so unless you are a huge poetry fan, you may find this tedious, as I did. All in all, I would say skip this one and read JLT's other three novels!"
1,not like her others,"I, too, thought Turner's latest book was a bit on the boring side and not as good as her other books. I found myself annoyed at the poetry throughout the book and thought it took away from the story of which was already hard to follow. I did laugh a bit, but mostly from the fact that it seemed doubtful the author really had a notion of the subject in which she was writing."
1,Bare-bones rip-off,"Overly simplistic animation and I'm not entirely sure the developer has Mr. Lehrer's permission to sell this CD. Art Sussman's ""Dr. Art Does Science"" DVDDr. Art Does Sciencehas a superior animated version of the song plus a couple of extra hours of science-related materials. You can find the flash animation just by Googling ""the elements""."
5,Just what I needed,"The mailbox is the perfect size for those of you that receive alot of packages or flat rate boxes in the mail. I got tired of the mailman not coming to the door to deliver a package that I spent good money on to be shipped or me having to leave work early to be able to pick up a package at the Post Office. The mailbox is shipped as a box in a box with a couple airbags in the front of the box it sits in, but I received mine with a couple dents and chipped paint from the box being dropped,kicked and thrown everywhere by the Post Office. Luckily it is only a mailbox and not something of value and the metal was easy enough to straighten out and hit it with a rattle can for touch-ups."
5,"Otro libro fantastico de la ""Eyewitness Series"" en Espanol",Another fantastic eyewitness book in spanish. Projects galore can be made from the information given. Children can't put it down after starting to look in it. The pictures are the grabber and the information keeps them looking. Discussions of reptiles from various countries similar or the same as in the book keeps the interest high.
5,Another Good Crosman,"This product was not for me. I prefer either a bulk fill set up or a smaller 12gm CO2. But this is everything that can be expected from all the other 2250s. Unlike the 2250b this one comes with a steel breech. Great product to customize, a lot of after market kits of all sorts so if you are looking for something to customize and have fun with. or to have fun just as is and just shoot around without having to break a heavy barrel. This will do the job."
3,Men's traveling case,"It does the job, which there were inside compartments to slide and store toothbrushes, razors. You know the stuff guys use. Though honestly my husband was just glad to not have to use one of my female containers when traveling. Though I'm still hunting for a more versatile bag for him."
1,Don't hang this by the strap,"Well it certainly is big. I recently bought a hook to hang it off the towel rack as to use up less counter space. After maybe 4 times of doing this, the inner plastic lining began to tear. I can see this is not going to end well. Without this issue, I'd give it 4 stars."
4,exactly as described,"My bf was using a bag from a comforter set to carry his toiletries.. we travel a lot and he has many things. I had to force him to use this.... It doesn't really fit everything but this was the biggest bag I could find that was not a suitcase. I wish it was a little bigger with a few more compartments, but overall it serves its purpose."
3,Different than the pictures,The bag I received was a very light brown and not the dark brown/blackish color they have in the photos. I am not too particular about the color though so I am going to keep it. The travel bottles i received were different also. I received 3 small shampoo bottles and 1 toothbrush container instead of the 3 larger shampoo bottles.Overall the quality is excellent and I would recommend. Haven't had it long enough to comment on the durability but it seems like it wont have any problems with normal wear and tear.If it wasn't for the fact I received something other than what I paid for I would give it 5 stars. Hopefully you get lucky and get what you see in the picture.
5,Good Dopp Kit!,"This is a good Dopp Kit for the money. Plenty of space, with two internal pockets. The lower zip is a nice feature. The three plastic bottles in the lower drop compartment seem rather flimsy, and are probably more suited for more viscous liquids. The toothbrush holder is a nice feature. The bag also collapses on itself, which allows it to be compressed in a suitcase (especially if there is nothing in the lower compartment). Overall, I'm very pleased with the purchase."
5,Excellent,"I have been using a shaving case that I've had for 15 years, decided it needed to be retired. This case was a Perfect replacement. Much more room and looks like it will last a long time. Quality materials and craftsmanship."
4,Long overdue,"I spent way too many years jamming everything into a small, single compartment shaving kit. With two compartments and a couple of small side pockets in the larger compartment, this kit allows separate storage for all those things that used to just get tossed into a jumble. I like it."
4,Motorcycle Restoration Guide,"As someone in the middle of my first bike restoration, I can only say I wished I had read it before I puchased my two wheeled train wreck. Very good book, I recommend it for beginners or people like me who find themselves in water a bit over their heads. I would rate it a 5 star, but the subject matter of bike motorcycle restoration is very broad, and sometimes the book left me wanting deeper information."
4,How to Restore your motorcycle,This is a great book with lots of information for the novice and I am happy to say this book will be republished in April of 2010.
5,How to Restore Your Motorcycle,"This is an excellent publication, well written and well illustrated. An absolute MUST for any restorer."
2,Shi Tzu still eats poop,"My 8 month old Shi Tzu still eats her poop. I guess nothing works. I've tried everything. The product does, in fact, alter the dogs smell and the smell of the poop. As far as the oder goes, I got it right away and it is just what I ordered."
1,Didn't seem to work,This didn't seem to work for my beagle. He has super bad breath and eats poop all the time. I'm thinking there is no cure for him.
3,Can work if your dog will eat it...,"These are tablets not much bigger than an ibuprofen tablet. You get 150 tablets for the cost. I also purchased Breath-eze Breath & Gas Relief Mints. They are the same color/odor as this product but much larger, about the size of three stacked quarters. I've actually seen my dogs eventually chew those up out of boredom, and we are two for two on these NaturVet tablets - I kept putting it in my Maltese's mouth and even tried holding his mouth shut and stroking his throat like I've seen done to make an animal swallow a pill...no go. He spit it out repeatedly. I am not sure it would do much good for breath if he won't chew it up, but might help with his ""occasional gas"" - if I could get him to swallow it. Maybe I'll try putting them in with the food, but our other dog the Lhasa Apso will probably eat them all. They are both most interested in what the other one has, but she is the worst about it. So if your dog is not too picky, I'm sure these would do the job."
2,ENDANGERED SPECIES SHOULD BE EXTINCT,"THIS IS NOT THE BANDS BEST WORK. I AM A HUGE FAN OF Y&T'S OLDER MUSIC. SONGS LIKE MEANSTREAK, ALL AMERICAN BOY, MIDNIGHT IN TOKYO, BLACK TIGER, DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK & CONTAGIOUS ETC... THESE ARE SONGS THAT I STILL SING TO MYSELF. I REMEMBER THESE TUNES. THOUGH THE SONGS I LISTED ARE DIFFERENT IN STYLE, THEY ARE UNMISTAKABLY Y&T. AFTER 10 PLAYS OF THE NEW CD ""ENDANGERED SPECIES"" I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT THE ONLY THING I WILL REMEMBER IS HOW MUCH I PAYED FOR IT. SORRY GUYS, YOU SEEM TO HAVE LOST YOUR TOUCH FOR CREATING FUN IN YOUR FACE METAL. STILL, I WILL ALWAYS BE A FAN."
5,GREAT STORY!,"Rowena Avery cleverfully illustrates that when someone is afraid of everything, that someone missed out on everything!Unique dolls highlight Seth as he learns to try new things with his other doll friends.Highly original and entertaining. This is a must-have for any collection."
5,Awsome watch,This is by far the finest watch that I have ever gotten. Beautiful and classy looking. Thought I was sceptical at first as I popped of the back to see if it was a fake (I'm just paranoid I guess) turns out it was a kinetic and I was very excited to see that. All in all I just love this watch.
5,Nice quality,The product arrived quicker than I expected. It is of a very quality. I like that the cover is removable and washable. It is very comfortable.
3,Not a $100 live album....,"....but not a Jimmy Buffet disgrace either. (Has anyone ever paid that kind of money for this disc?) I saw JC&BBB at a small club show in late 1984 and it was one of the best concerts I've ever seen. The crowd was really into the show and the band came back for encore after encore to the point that we were saying ""ENOUGH!"" This record doesn't come close to generating the same kind of excitement, but it's still a credible piece of work. (A little short, but that's how cd's were back then.) If they were to tour again, I'd get back in line for tickets."
1,not much content,"This large print pamphlet can be read in about a half hour which was rather disappointing as I was hoping for more.With so little content, it is difficult to rate this""book"" but I was quite disappointed.The seller made out big on the shipping fee as it could not have cost more than 50 cents to mail this ""book"".Not recommended."
4,Fitting & Pattern Alteration,"This book has been used as a textbook. It goes into perhaps more detail about fashion than some home sewers are looking for. I appreciate the ability to see the necessary pattern alteration for just about ANY body irregularity. Example - the book shows the pattern alteration for prominent shoulder blades. It really has pretty much every possible fitting problem. I recommend taking this book out of the library first. If your library doesn't have it, they can probably get it through an Inter-Library Loan. You may not really need to own this book unless you are sewing for quite a few people. You might just want to copy a page or 2. It is a great book for sewers learning fitting."
5,Pattern Alteration book,"I have had this for quite awhile, but with Christmas and all, I haven't had time to read it. I have scanned it, and it looks like a good book."
4,Good technical support for adjusting patterns,I had to purchase this book for a couture sewing class I was taking. It was actually required. Couldn't find it anywhere for less than $125.00. Found it on Amazon used for $30.00- great deal. It shipped right away and is in excellent condition. It shows in detail how to alter patterns for couture sewing to cover irregularities tht occur in the human bodies and differences we all have.
5,Wonderful!,"the system is great! the sound, the look, the remote, the portability... it's great! i take it to work and my students get a kick out of it as well. it's a very impressive item and very affordable.all around recommended product! it'll get you compliments too :-)"
4,"Awesome player, awesome value",Great product. I've bought two in the past month! One for my self and one for a family member that like it after they saw mine.
1,iLuv 1552,"I only give this product 1 star. This unit eats batteries. Even without having the iPod installed this portable player still depletes the batteries quicker than other portable radios. BTW, I posted a review at the iLife web site a few weeks ago. They refuse to show it. All they want to post is a letter with a four star rating."
1,Junk,"This is an incredibly inferior piece of junk. Although it looks and feels sharp, the sound quality is just horrendous, both in the iPod and FM mode. What a disappointment! After thoroughly researching all the other iPod portable speaker systems with FM radio, it looks like the Altec Lansing im600 is the one to beat. Do not bother with this piece of trash."
2,Unmet Expectations,"Seemed to be just what I was looking for. But that was not reality.While the unit looks nice and had a good price, for use a low volumes in a room setting, it just did not but it. It had a constant hum when music was not play. The remote was difficult to change the settings. The sound waulity at low volumes was poor and had little base. The knob on the front were difficult to spin as they are flush to the face. In an outdoor setting this may work as intended but it was not what I needed. The blue light LCD is very bright in a dark room. Also be careful of the return policy and don't expect any reply to e-mails. Maybe my unit was defective, but I will never know."
3,NOT WHAT IT SEEMS,"THE STEREO IS NOT AS LOUD AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. I HAVE TO TURN IT UP TO 20 TO HEAR IT BY MYSELF. ITS GOOD FOR A BEDROOM OR LIVING ROOM OR SOMETHING, ONCE I HAD A GROUP OF PEOPLE IN THE ROOM AT MAX VOLUME 40 IT WAS HARD TO HEAR. I GOT IT FOR A PORTABLE OUTDOORS RADIO, I THINK ITS NOT GOING TO BE LOUD ENOUGH TO HEAR OUT SIDE WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE. I HAVE NOT GOTTEN THE VIDEO FEATURE TO WORK. THE SPEAKERS ARE ABOUT 1/4 OF THE SIZE OF THE SHOW SPEAKER SCREEN/COVER. ITS OKAY FOR THE PRICE."
4,iLUV i552BLK,The product itself is really good the only downside to it is that it doesn't operate on 240v.
1,Batteries go dead when item is not in use,This unit takes 8 C size batteries. New batteries will go dead even with the unit turned off. The first time this happened I assumed that I must have mistakenly left the unit on. When I tried again making certain the unit was off the batteries where dead again when I looked at again a few weeks later. It's fine if you can always plug it in but you must take out the batteries after use if you want to use it where it can't be plugged in. Don't buy this.
3,Does not charge nano 4g,"I really wanted this to work, but it does not support the charging function on the newer iPod nano, 4th generation. Really attractive system, but I had to return it since I needed something that would charge as well."
1,Broke on second day of use,This item broke on the second day of use. The antenna broke off after a little adjusting. It is poorly made and not worth the money.
2,Not worth the price,This Ipod dock looks nice and has some nice features. After reading a few reviews I decided to purchase it as I wasn't too concerned about sound quality and wanted a handy player that I could bring around where I needed. I also thought that it was nice that it came with a remote as well.Once I received it I was unfortunately disappointed. The sound quality is not great and I was surprised that the loudest setting was fine to fill my bedroom but that was about it. Using it outside on the patio with a group of any size doesn't really work and it doesn't really even fill a larger room.Also the remote did not work at all and just ended up sitting on my desk and never being used.It takes C batteries if you don't want to plug it in and the battery life left something to be desired.Overall this dock works ok and looks nice but I would not buy again unless the price was discounted around the $50 range.
1,Dosent charge,This product states it charges iPod 4th generation - it dosent unless it was made after February of 2007 - which mine was not - I sent it back to the manufacturer for one made after Feb 2007. The jobber that sent it to me was under the impression the unit was a recent one - they had no idea it was made 3 years ago.Its a nice unit besides that fact.
4,nice product,the product i was sent had no audio hook up but everything else worked great. my girlfriends ipod classic and her son's new ipod nano worked great with the speakers.
3,Good for the office,Although the material seems like it would break easily the performance is ok for a desktop if power is not an issue. It does everything it claims except AM reception is poor. Operation of the unit is not all that good but it is simple and the included remote is almost useless. The adapters for the ipod did not fit mine properly and there is no tech support for this. It does play the Ipod and charge it and the FM signal seems adequate. If you need a quality product then dig into your wallet and buy something else but for the money I thought I got what I paid for.
3,Sound quality,"Not too fond of this, but I guess you get what you pay for. The power button doesn't seem to work, only works on the remote and the sound quality is pretty distracting."
5,Good,"Good product, well built, Remote Control is nice but cant switch between playlist, for the price a really recommend it for anyone that needs a good quality player with lots of compatibility options."
5,Pleasantly surprised,"I bought this after my other ipod speakers (which cost much more!) stopped working after 2 months. I am very pleased with this product. While it's a little bit bigger than I thought it would be, the sound is fab. And it worked right out of the box...seemingly a miracle these days. I did come very close to throwing out the remote with the packing material, since it was taped face down to the bottom of the styrafoam and blended perfectly with the color. But the remote works from across the room, the sound is clear with the iPod, my video 30 fits like a glove in the dock, the radio comes in without issue, and even loud volume doesn't distort the noise. I can recommend this thing!"
4,Good system at a good price,"I purchased this after a long search. Owning a Jwin iLuv i277, I was happy with the somewhat cheap products the company puts out. From what I gathered from other reviews the major weak points are the sound quality isn't the best since the speakers are on only 2 inches and ipod fits too loosely in the cradle. One the first point they are somewhat correct. There isn't lots of bass and the sound distorts a little at the high end of the volume dial. On the second it was as wrong as it could be (at least in my case). I have a video and nano ipod and they fit snuggly and dont come free when moving around with the unit. The only other small minus is that the unit has a power brick electrical plug, but overall a great purchase."
3,Jwin Electronics I552WHT Ipod Portable S,"The Jwin Electronics I552WHT Ipod Portable S is adequate but not outstanding. The sound quality is disappointing. The FM reception is poor. Frankly, for the amount of money that we are asked to shell out for things that work with iPods, I am finding many of these products to be rip-offs. Why is it so difficult to have basic features found on less expensive conventional boomboxes, such as control of tone or even an equalizer?Jwin Electronics I552WHT Ipod Portable S"
3,Good entry-level book for PLC's,"Mr. Filer's book is an excellent choice for anyone beginning to work with Allen-Bradley PLCs,SLCs. It does discuss many of the complex functions and capabilities of AB's PLCs, however, it does not go into enough depth to be an aid in ""advanced programming""."
5,Tiger rug,Fits perfectly in a Tigers themed room. Perfect addition for my boys bathroom. Would go nicely as welcome matt to sports room.
2,Ethereal Vision of 18th Century Life - Too Delicate For Me,"The charaters were thinly portrayed so it was hard to identify with them - clearly the author wanted the reader to be afloat and not grounded in detail. If you can connect poetically you can enjoy a book like this; if not, it is pretentious clap trap. I loved The Book Shop: A Novel by Fitzgerald, but this one was just too vague for my taste. For instance, Fritz's brother starts out jealous of Fritz's love idol, but then falls in love with her himself. There are no clues given as to how this transformation took place, no insights into what was so alluring about this giggling adolescent. Perhaps it's an upper class phenomenon where people who are bored with life create in their minds a world where some invented beauty obscures all else. I imagine the failure is within me, but if you have but one book to read by Fitzgerald, I'd recommend The Book Shop: A Novel."
2,Way Too Thin,"For all its faults as a novel, The Blue Flower gets its prose right -- page after page of happy perfection. And I think Ms. Fitzgerald's rendering of the period German -- and the feel of that rare, long-dead cultural milieu -- into English, is absolutely perfect. That said...watch out! The novel is either a) too short; or b) short of adequate raw material. Ms. Fitzgerald's task was daunting -- how to make interesting this story of two star-crossed, half-formed provincial children in 18th century Germany. I didn't get a feel for Novalis's art (was there any really?) or his commitment to Sophie (notice he wasted no time after her demise in betrothing another!) or what they felt for each other (the little Sophie limned in this story would have preferred a cute warm hedgehog). Nor did I apprehend any calls to issues so often encountered in the humanities. Give dis one a pass."
2,Vastly Overrated,"I kept reading this novel, hoping that the conclusion would reveal the motivation behind the actions of the main protaganist and the people around him but I came away disappointed. Characters seemed to drift in and out of the novel, revealing little about what they do or are about. The epilogue could be made more poignant if only the reader could connect with the characters at some level but this was made difficult by the author's inability to reveal the motivations about the characters. The positive side to this novel is the brief exploration of European aristocracy in the 17th Century. Check out Penelope Fitzgerald's Booker Prize-winning Offshore instead where the characters are rich and heart-warming."
5,From an investment banker in New York,"This is a great novel. One should not read it - or rate it - based on such things as plot and level of adrenaline it produces. There are many other reasons for reading a novel. One of them is language. The other is ideas. The lines in this book are often delicious. The thoughts - deep and complex in their exploration of very fundamental values - are so neatly packaged in such a thin volume!!! She minces no words and yet manages to convey, with her masterful strokes, the feelings and realities of the times. Penelope Fitzgerald brings us a most refreshing style of writing, and brings some very important questions to the forefront. This is a highly recommended book for true lovers of great literature."
2,A big dissapointment!,"I purchased this book with eagar anticipation after reading several highly favorable reviews. I was so dissappointed with the story that I could not even finish it.The historical content was boring. The characters were insipid and two dimensional-even Lolita,a book which is highly overrated , had more depth to it. The writing style was satisfactory but not outstanding. I haven't read her other books and have no intention to. There so many other superb works out there to read so don't waste your time on this one"
2,Much ado about nothing!,"After reading the professional reviews about this book, I couldn't wait to read it. What a disappointment! It was a quick enough read, and not uninteresting, but the characters were underdeveloped and I never understood what made Sophie so beguiling. I won't remember this book a year from now."
2,Too Impressionistic -- Leave that to Artists,"The Blue Flower is supposed to be an award winning book, but it is certainly one of the most disappointing pieces of ""literature"" that I've ever read. The writing is beautiful, even sometimes lyrical, and creates an impressionistic picture of its time, place, and characters. But, it is too impressionistic. While I think I understand something of the main character and even, perhaps, his feelings about Sophie,I reached the end of the book and said to myself: who cares? Normally, when I've read a good fictional account of a real-life person, the fiction almost always inspires me to either seek out more fictional accounts about that person or to seek out a biography. The Blue Flower left me hoping that I'd never come across Novalis! I'm sure that cannot be what the writer intended. Too bad."
2,Zzzzzz....,"I'm desperately trying to get through this book. It's full of German language and history...not a bad thing but makes it quite difficult to follow. Thus far (nearly halfway through the book), I have yet to find anything compelling to keep me reading it."
3,"I hate to be a nay-sayer, but...","On the strength of the most positive NYTimes Book Review I've seen in recent years, I bought and read ""The Blue Flower."" It strikes me as the sort of book that only the British can write and only the critics (and other authors) can really love. The book is unquestionably finely written, and Penelope Fitzgerald is unquestionably a writer of extraordinary talent. I found it impossible, however, to become actively engaged as a reader when the main character is an early nineteenth century romantic poet in love with a 14-year-old girl with whom he has absolutely nothing in common. The girl's lack of intelligence, lack of experience, lack of education, and lack of any strong traits of character make her so unlikely a love object that I found I could not sympathize with Fritz, much less identify with his woes"
1,Yuck,"I could NOT for the life of me get into this book. I found the writing to be convoluted and confusing -- so much so that I couldn't follow what was happening. After about 60 pages, I finally gave up and never finished the book."
5,Convention and formality can be more than disturbing.,"The reader must follow this book through...to the very bitter end, where he will be disturbed not only by the closing, but even moreso by the wretchedness of the conventions and rigidness of the times. Ms. Fitzgerald takes us into 18th century Germany, from which we do not return untroubled."
2,Couldn't wait for it to end,"I wanted to like this book -- really. I tried and tried to until I got about 3/4th of the way through, then I had to own up to being bored. I wish I could have just appreciated the quality writing, but I couldn't get past dull characters and a slow plot."
2,The Blue Flower,"This book was not as interesting as I thought it would be the characters were not as exciting. The characters in the story were easy to relate to, but there could have been more drama, and more exciting things happening. The story is very boring at first then towards the middle there is a little excitement, but still not enough."
2,Disappointing,"I found this to be a disapointing book It's been lauded as bringing an earlier German period to life, but I don't find it more convincing than other novelists. The writing is terse, leaving too much to the imagination, and there is not enough details about the characters to care much about them. It portrays the early life of genius student Fritz von Hardenberg, before becoming the famous Romatic poet Novalis."
4,Sentimental,"An interesting book about love. The reviewer who comments on the feminine character being boring is correct, but love rarely has to do with mutual admiration.The word for that is friendship, or partnership.Just a thought."
3,I Tried Believe Me I Tried,When I started The Blue Flower I knew it would not be an easy read. But I survived and enjoyed Human Voices and I needed a thinking book. The plot and characters were excellent. I'm afraid it was my 57 year old brain that has denied The Blue Flower five stars. I simply could not follow all the characters and their different names. I have to ask myself. Was this book just too much for me? Is my brain just a little too addled to remember three names for every character? How depressing.....and to think that I once got through Crime and Punishment...but God Bless You Penelope. You do keep the mind challenged!
2,Tremendously overrated,"In my opinion, this book is/was over-rated. While Fitzgerald is a decent writer and many of the subcharacters in this novel have interesting lives and one-liners, this book does not add up to a satisfactory read. My fantasy is that after spending a few years translating Novalis's writings, Fitzgerald felt compelled to put her knowledge to good use -- there's nothing wrong with this, but it just didn't work for me. I didn't know who Novalis was when I started this book, and I had virtually no interest in finding out who Novalis was by the time I finished this book -- I didn't care."
2,disappointly shallow,"I had just finished rereading Thomas Mann's BUDDENBROOKS, in which he uses German titles and place names but without the confusion I found in THE BLUE FLOWER where I had to go back to find out who a character was or where a place fit into the novel. The book had no real plot, one dimensional characters and what is most important no real sense of who Novalis was as a poet or why he was admired in his time. There was no real description of Sophie, except that her hair was neither brunette nor blonde, and her stupidity was apparent from her journal entries and the few letters she wrote. There were some nice turn of phrases and descriptions but that did not compensate for the lack of interest I had in the novel."
3,Penelope is like retsina,"An acquired taste. She's acidic and ruthlessly matter-of-fact. She writes about the German Romantics without the slightest trace of romanticism in her prose.Her writing is an exercise in hiding. You have to turn over the rocks. This is not a ""great read"" if by that one thinks of a ""page turner."" She is not an accessible writer and doesn't try to be.Nothing actually happens in this book. That annoys a lot of people who seem to think that this is somehow ""shallow."" This is not a shallow book at all. The reader has to do some of the work, that's all. Historically, this is a strange and unaccustomed area for the American reader. My three star rating is actually very high. I never give fives (OK, to a musical group I like) so four is tops. Three is really good. (I wish we could give half-stars).It might help to read some other Penelope Fitz books first. ""Offshore,"" is one of my favorites. Blue Flower is not for everyone.EKW"
5,history not historical fiction,"one of my favorite books and the reason, i think, is simple. this book is not about plot, is not a character study, and is not a morality play, really. i don't think its purpose is any one of these; it's purpose is something else altogether, a pleasure of an entirely different sort. re-read the first few pages and something occurs to you--there's something very odd here, something off- kilter about the syntax of the sentences, about the flow of the ideas. you either love the book or hate it after the first few pages. for those of us who loved it, we could see, hear really, the seventeenth-century german talking; the clunky, awkward, verbose beauty of it all. what is extraordinary about this book is that penelope fitzgerald, in a feat of sustained imagination i boggle at, has written a book as it would have been written and imagined some four centuries ago. it's like discovering a book written by novalis, not just about him."
4,Engaging characters kept my attention. Lovely prose.,"The writing is extraordinary. Books allow me to experience different perspectives and widen my horizons. As I entered the world of ""The Blue Flower"" I recaptured that joy of reading (the last few books I read weren't very good). The characters were not predictable and I cared about them. During the day, at work, I pondered what would happen next. That is how I know I love a book. It engaged me when I least expected it (when I wasn't reading) and I was sad when the final page was turned. I recommend it."
2,Not an easy read.,I had so much trouble getting into this book it was painful. It is written about a time most of us are not familiar with and in a way that it is not embracing. Not a good choice for the beach or the train.
2,I just didn't get it,"I wanted to like this book. I knew it would be a hard read and was up for the challenge. I just didn't like it very much. After reading one of the amazon reader reviews, I feel I have a little better understanding of the book, but it still didn't do much for me."
1,"Pretentious, Shallow & Boring.","If one was trying to fight the old ennui one would not attempt to read The Blue Flower. Why do Fitzgerald's characters behave so? No attempt to explain their actions or emotions is made. What made Sophie so attractive? She seems to be devoid of personality & lacking in either charm or beauty. Frederica seems the most interesting character. She did, after all, have the intelligence not to be able to understand the parable of the blue flower."
5,This is an excellent CD,"This is a great mix of Aztec, Central American Music with pan pipes Very well played. If you want a taste of good andes style music, this one will spoil you."
3,"the mystery is lacking, but the romance is not","I enjoy Laurens' new series, though I seem to be one of few. In the second installment of the Bastion Club series, she continues in the vein of the first. Again, she isn't able to pull off the mystery element as well as she did in the Cynster series and that's a shame. They mystery plot just never seems to catch your attention, and it is (for me anyway) easily solved long before the official ""unmasking"". However, the characters of Alicia and Tony are compelling and well-written and I enjoyed reading their story. I didn't find the book hard to get through, but I am a fast reader. I did start skipping over long paragraphs of text when I got to the (seemingly) 100th time they kissed for 4 pages, but the sex scenes themselves were, as always, delicious. I hope in the next installment of this series that Laurens can sharpen the plot and give her well-written characters an equally well-written structure in which to fall in love."
5,Bastion Club,"I read all of Stephanie Laurens books. This set of the men of the bastion club was great. I liked all of the books, but this was a particular favorite because it show the problems that can occur without good communication."
4,A Gentleman's Honor,The perfect balance of passion and intrigue. This is a great series of books. I highly recommend them all! Must reads!
2,Redundant,"I like for the hero and heroines to have chemistry. What I don't like is reading four hundred pages of one continuous love scene. I don't know how many ways one can write about heart-bursting, soul-wrenching, cataclysmic maelstroms of passion, but after having read A Gentleman's Honor, I can go on and on... and on. It was so repetitive, I ended up skimming most of the book.More substance, less redundant love scenes, please.I also found the heroine, Alicia, to be finicky. She so deeply cares about her younger sister and yet engages in a love affair that has the potential to ruin everything (we know it won't because our hero is an upright, gentleman-y sort of a chap). She decides the passion and lust she feels for our hero is enough for her to remain his mistress - and yet kicks herself for putting herself in a position where she will ""indubitably"" end up hurt. Um..?Was disappointing, to say in the least."
5,Stephanie Laurens Is Back,"""A Gentleman's Honor"" is the 2nd Book in the Bastion Series. Though I enjoyed the 1st book in the series, A LADY CHOOSEN there was alot of background needed to get the reader up to speed. I feel with the second book, this book, that SL was able to focus on the story line and the hero and heroine more.As always Alicia is a strong and independent SL Heroine and is not likely to let our hero Tony come in and just save the day, not with out her knowing what is going on. We get to know more of the members of the Bastion club, sort of wetting our appitites for the books to come.SL also brings back characters from her Cynster series, nice to see characters we love before they are married, as well as the hero and heroine from her book ""Captain Jacks Woman"" Though its nice if you have read CJW it is not nessesary to enjoy ""A Gentleman Honor."" If you like SL you will more then like enjoy this book too."
2,Soooo Sad........zzzzzzzzz........,"It's just so so sad, so sad that I wasn't able to finish this book, I just hate it when this happens. It start out okay, I liked the intro, the 1st - 20 pages were interesting, liked Alicia and Adriana alot, then it went downhill from there, it just totally lost me. I kept telling myself over and over that it will get better but....I just didn't care anymore. I spent three days reading this, have not reached 1/2 of the book, then told myself, it just wasn't worth it, i could've read and finished two books during those three days i spent reading this one. This is my first Stephanie Laurens book and it will definitely be my last. Should've listened to the reviews but was too stubborn, thought it might be different for me but...zzzzz."
2,"Don't HATE it, but don't LIKE it either","First, I love Stephanie Laurens. I used to buy based on her name alone. This book is surely written by an imposter. I'm forcing myself to finish it, but under great duress. The man is not a gentleman, and the woman is not a lady. Dang it, that's why I READ these stories. She decides to allow a seduction because she'll never get to find out what its all about otherwise--ah, and then we're frequently (albeit quickly) told about all the potential suitors she waves away. I think I hate Tony. If he would stop mentioning he plans to marry her, I think I'd like him better. There is NO WAY he is in love with this woman any more than she's in love with him. Alicia is an idiot, and if I might add, possibly the worst chaperone EVER. I dislike these people immensely. Please do yourself a favor and skip this--read Ms. Lauren's ""On a Wild Night"" instead. (Don't bother with ""On a Wild Dawn"" or, do what I do, and read those 2 out of sequence...)"
2,Well below this author's standard,"I loved most of Laurens' Cynster books, they combined interesting characters and really good sexy scenes with well-written, intriguing plots. However, this book, along with her last three or four books, lacks the charm of Laurens' earlier works. The author has used passion as if it were some type of filler to stuff into all the empty space around the bland characters and limp plot. To my own amazement, instead of savoring the love scenes, I found myself skipping over them just to get on with the story before giving up on the book altogether."
1,Tedious and a bore,"I've enjoyed many Stephanie Lauren books. Regrettably, this isn't one of them. There is a remarkably stupid mystery around which Ms. Lauren tries to craft a plot. The humdrum details of this mystery are regurgitated every chapter -- to take up space, it seems. The main characters could have been more exciting.Save your money or at least get the book from the library."
2,No Fun,"I picked this movie up with the hopes of some cool fun park twist and turns. What could be more fun than watching some teens get chased through an amusement park by a psychopathic killer clown right?! Well...I wouldn't be able to tell ya cuz this film didn't deliver in that aspect. It was done in more of a memory sequence, not cool!! It did not keep my attention, it was pretty much a snoozer. There were a couple parts that I can recall that were a little squeamish, but other than that, nothing really stood out. At least it wasn't homemade with a camcorder and 1,000, that's one good thing. I'd have to say, skip this one......unless of course you LOVE clown movies and collect them. In that case knock yourself out...no really, knock yourself out! LOL"
2,Tension and the Spark review,"Darren Hayes' beautiful voice was mellow and enjoyable, but this CD isn't one of my favourites. There were catchy mellodies and great music, but by the end of the CD it all sounded the same."
5,Very Impressive,"I've been a fan of Darren's since he first came out w/ Savage Garden. I, fortunately, got to meet him in person at the release of his last album ""Spin"". The Tension and the Spark has impressed me way beyond any other work he has done, it is soulful, the lyrics are very strong; his vocals are the best I've ever heard. I like every song the CD has to offer and anyone who has given this CD a bad review is simply wrong."
4,Excellent effort!,"This is an excellent CD by Darren Hayes! I liked it better than ""Spin"". I found the songs a bit more catchy than his previous stuff. Many of the songs deal with emotions and emotional issues beyond most vacant pop songs. And there is no sappy stuff like ""I Knew I Loved You"" or ""Truly Madly Deeply"" from the Savage Garden days. Good job, Darren, and congrats on coming out! Hope you keep making music!"
3,Great music if you can play it,"I like this album - I would like it a lot better if I could actually listen to it, specifically on my iPod. But I can't, because this album is copy protected by Sony's new OpenMG technology. This will make it impossible to rip the music to the PC (trust me, it comes out all distorted if you try). Use the ""pre-ripped for PC"" feature (whereby you download from the web) and be aware that a recent edition of PC magazine warns users that these protection schemes will reduce the security of your PC. I wasn't about to take this risk, so I'm not listening to The Tension and the Spark. Sadly."
1,Doesn't play on Macs!,"I can't really rate this album, because it has built-in copy-protection that doesn't let me play it on my Mac! Bad move, Columbia Records!"
1,Love the music HATE THE COPY PROTECTION!,All I want to do is put this music on my iPod. The copy protection is a bit too stringent. I've had to copy their software onto my computer and I still don't know if I can get this into iTunes. I think Darren Hays is very talented but I'll never buy a CD of his again.
2,"loving darren, but i'm not impressed","I've definitely been a fan of Darren Hayes way back since when he was laying out records in the duo, Savage Garden. I was in junior highschool, and I am still playing their two albums, and it's a very sad thing that they seperated.Darren has a fantastic voice, as he's shown us all. But I am really, really not impressed with this album- the album's main single is a complete flop, with an over-repetitive chorus- not to mention the more-superficial-than-normal lyrics.His album ""Spin"" was very poppy, but had some great lyrical content. And it wasn't so sloppy!But I guess all artists have their days, and so I gave it two stars for his honesty: ""I'm willing to sleep my way to the top, I wanna be pop...ular.""Check out his first album..."
2,All the same,"The songs are good, don't get me wrong, but the fast beat songs... sound like the other fast beat songs... and the slow songs sound like the other slow songs. I wish there was a more unique tune to this cd, I think the techno-ish style is cool, but not when every song is like that.Good try Darren Hayes, but keep trying"
5,Pleasant Surprise!,"When I first listened to this CD, I was not impressed. However after listening a few times I began to see what Darren had done. Bloody brilliant I say! I truly enjoy this CD. It reminds me that we all have dark periods and come through them. What a cathartic the CD must have been!! Yes, this music is very different to that of the romantic side of Savage Garden but it is so worth experiencing! When you really listen, you will see the meaning and appreciate the album."
4,Mostly instrumentals but a nice listen,"This is a very nice listen, but I give it only 4 stars becuase of it's instrumental nature may not lead it to be a very memorable album.If you were looking for the synthpoppy styles of Pet Shop Boys )PSB)this may not be the album, but if you like the Pet Shop Boys I think you will like this album anyways. While it still unquestionably sounds like the PSB, many of the tracks are instrumentals and all of them are very laid back. Even the ones that do have a dancy best use very soft samples.While I usually prefer the PSB's more upbeat tracks from their past, I was surprised to like this album. The composition is very mature and it's obvious the PSB have been busy perfecting their skills between albums.Overall I have to say if you like the PSB, you wll like this album, even if you prefered the PSBs because of their synthpop background."
5,The book does its best with this perplexing software,"The author does his best to explain how to use this rather convoluted and counterintuitive software. It doesn't help that there are so many versions that it is hard to know exactly what your particular incarnation of the software is capable of, let alone getting it to actually do it. For the time being, I'm giving up on it and letting Photoshop take over where the epson software leaves off."
5,SilverFast Guide,"This book along with the downloaded software are very good TOGETHER! No matter what, everything takes time until we learn. Be patient, read, study, understand. It is worth it!"
1,The Guide that never arrived,"I selected Silverfast: The Official Guide because I wanted to learn more about this excellent software program, so I paid for it but it never arrived. It was due about the last week of August'05, but I've missed out, so whilst the Silverfast product is A1 I cannot give you an opinion re the Guide, sorry."
4,Chillin in space,If you could go on a spacewalk with an ipod or discman..this would definately have to be on your playlist. I've owned this cd since about when it came out and it is still frequently in my player. This minimalist space ambient is definately some of the best of the genre and if you want something very chilled and great for headphones this is a must for your collection.
4,Intelligent Abient,"I agree with just about everything the reviewer below states except the star ranking. I'd give a 3.5 but rounded up. This music is great for what it is, spacey ambient chill out music, but there is nothing really ground breaking or special here. Don't let that dissuade you though, it is a thouroughly enjoyable album. The best way to listen to it is with the lights out, on good speakers or headphones and with some cedarwood incense burning. I reccomend it to fans of this genre."
4,Musher's Secret works,"Our Irish setter has rapidly growing hair between her pads and Musher's Secret eliminated the need to be concerned about this during our near zero snowy conditions. She stays out for hours with no discomfort, now."
4,Works pretty well,"I would recommend this product to city dog owners like ourselves- we've suspected there's been more salt than usual on the roads and sidewalks this year, so we've used it often and had to stop lees frequently to remove salt from our dog's paws. She's still bothered by rock salt in her paws when we use Musher's Secret, but doesn't seem to be in pain, as she was before started using it."
2,Don't think it really works.....,"I've used this both last winter and the previous one because my Chihuahua doesn't really care much for his boots. I have found, that even after ""globbing"" this stuff on, he will still lift his leg and let out a little screech in stinging pain from the salt. If that doesn't break your heart I don't know what will! It also seems to come be worn off by the time we're a only a block down the road! Unfortunately, I think boots are the way to go. No questions asked. Perhaps if you live in a more rural area (not a city polluted with ridiculous amounts of salt), this stuff may be a little more efficient."
4,Paw Balm,"Balm worked well on the dogs paws. The snow and ice was irritating my little dogs feet so we got it for her. We ended up using it on the big dog too because his feet were just dry and cracked. I think it helped both with protecting the little dog feet from the salt and the big dog feet cracking. Overall good product and worth the money I'd say. It was easy to apply and had a nice scent as a bonus. No stains on any of the flooring, although the first time we used it the dogs wouldn't stop licking their feet, so the next few times I used it I'd apply it right before we went out for a walk so they wouldn't have the opportunity to just sit there and lick it off. The dogs seem fine, so I'd say it's non-toxic."
3,I am unsure of the application.,I am unsure of the application. It is a hard paste and I do not know if I am putting on enough or if it is rubbing off as I place it on the other feet.
4,Its up to you,"It works, but it is messy. Nice back up if the dogs don't want the Muttlucks on. Dogs don't seem to mind it on."
1,MUSHERS OR VASELINE,"I needed to get something to protect my dogs paws from all of the saltthat is used in Chicago during the winter. A friend recommended Musher's.I should have used vaseline instead, it's a lot cheaper.Don't waste your money!I purchased Paw Wax Protector by 8 in 1."
5,Musher's is best kept secret!,"The sub-zero cold snap and icy conditions during Chicago's early winter storms this year was particularly hard on our pug (who's paws are too tiny for boots) and even for our bull mastiff. Musher's really protected and insulated their paws, and I even noticed that after putting it on my dogs and rubbing the residue into my hands, the natural waxes kept my hands much warmer in my gloves!"
2,dog hates it,"or possibly likes it TOO much. I've tried several times to apply and she licks it off ASAP, so I can't comment on how well it works (or doesn't) She gives it 5 stars for taste though!"
3,Caution is still advised,"Have used this product on my weimaraners in the Chgo. winters on overly salted streets & sidewalks. Not impressed, but it does provide a thin layer of protection-it is NOT salt proof. Caution still must be used against the salt, tissue damage, and freezing paws. We are still dealing with living tissue which freezes regardless.Also, this wax makes for a very slippery surface on non-carpeted floors. My older dog fell in the house while trying to run with the wax still on his paws and on the floor-exercise caution with the senior canines esp."
2,Not very good,"I purchased this item to protect my 2 Yorkies feet from the snow and ice. They won't wear booties so I decided to try this. I will say I was disappointed in this product. They stated that the wax-based cream would dry quickly, which I didn't find to be accurate. Also, when I took my dogs outside (for even 5 minutes), they seemed to be bothered by their feet. They still got snow and slush stuck between their pads and it didn't seem to protect them from the elements. I don't know if I should have put more on them, but if I should have, it would've been extremely difficult because of the consistency of this item. I wouldn't recommend this item."
4,seems to work pretty good,"My poodle is good with shoes but I'm not - bending over and shoeing a small dog 4 times a day is not fun. So I tried this stuff. It seems to work pretty well with salt and snow, but when it gets down below 10 Fahrenheit, he still walks better with the shoes. The best part is that I only need to apply it once a day.Product has a very faint odor of citronella -but ten times weaker than citronella candles. Keep a rag nearby to wipe your hands after applying - it's not a great human glove, and dog paws transfer stink. Who knew?"
5,Musher's Secret Works Great!,"Taking walks this winter with my Newfoundland has been much more enjoyable for both of us due to Musher's Secret. Before we go out, I just put a bit on the pads and fur on the bottoms of his feet; it works great to keep the snow from balling up. Many times before using Musher's Secret, when the snow made it hard for Farley to continue walking, we'd have to give up and go home. So far, I have not noticed any residue in the house from the wax. I am looking forward to trying it during the summer for any time on the hard, hot pavement."
3,Heel care ointment,Musher's Secret - The Invisible Shield - 200 gm TREADWELL PET PRODUCTSIt is easy to spread. Although Rex is not a fan of having anything put on his feet. It feels very much like vasoline with a aeromatic and warming sensation. Now putting it on my heels.. as Rex gets up and trys to get away... and then licks it off.
5,Works to keep the salt out of my paws,"I was kind of surprised when my humans first grabbed my little paws and rubbed this stuff on them, but they do all sorts of crazy things and it didn't hurt so I let them do it. Then when I went outside on the salt and slushy roads, my feet didn't hurt so much."
5,The Mushers Secret is out!!!,"Have a Puggle that bites his paws till they Bleed, I have tried everything to get him to stop. After 3 years and many, many visits to the vet and having to neglectfully put him on medication I thought I would try a different approach. I went on Amazon to find some dog boots for his paws ( he also has trouble in the winter with his feet freezing) and stumbled across Mushers. I have to admit it seemed to good to be true, even though the reviews were very good, but at this point I was committed to help him out of the misery. Before the Mushers was delivered his paws were bright red, hard, and chapped. After 2 days about 3 applications they were 100 times better, soft just like a puppy. I do have to admit he loves to taste everything so he did continue to lick his paws. It has been a week now and has stopped licking his paws and is running free and having fun. Mushers is everything it claims and more. I would recommend to anyone."
2,not all weather product,"I ordered this product excited to see that it was all season protection even in hot climates. I have 3 dogs that i walk 4 miles a day on pavement and pads on one of their feet were getting thin and needed something to protect them, and why not add to all 3 dogs to prevent it from happening to them. Well i had each one lie down and applied 3 coats to their pads and had them stay down for ten minutes. When i let them up I had waxy paw prints all over the ground, glad i did this outside and not in my house! Think when wax gets hot what does it do-melt of course, so they need to take the all year protection off the description. We don't get snow very often here, but if it does I will try to put it on their paws then and see if it works then. So if u buy this don't use it in warm or hot temperatures. Can't rate it on the cold weather."
2,Doesn't work for snowballing,"We bought this for our Wheaton to try and prevent the snowballs from forming in his pads. It didn't work. Within an hour of starting to snowshoe, we had to stop and get the snowballs out. We re-applied, filling his pads with the wax thinking that might be the trick, but by the time we got to the halfway point (another 30 min), he had snowballs in his pads again. I do think the wax lessened the amount of snowballing, and they seemed a bit easier to get out, but we have decided to buy booties instead. Disappointed."
4,seems to work,We're happy with the product because it's easier than pulling on his boots when we walk in the snow and on salt.
4,"Great Protector, use other stuff to heal",Love this for keeping all that salt and chemicals from hurting my dogs paws and keeping the snow from between her toes. This stuff is awesome at protecting her feet. To heal her cracked and rough pads I use Tuf-Foot its great.
4,"Isn't quite magic, but a useful product","I live in Chicago where the winters are very harsh and they salt the streets, which is very irritating to my dog's feet. The Musher's Secret does seem to make him more comfortable, but it doesn't do anything to prevent the build-up of snowballs between his toes (which the packaging claims to).Overall it's a nice protectant against salt, but I don't think it does anything for snow."
5,By far his best!!!,"This is by far the best CD Colin has produced. Combining outstanding lyrics, and wonderful blues guitar puts Colin on par with the best of the blues players today. This is a CD which should be in every serious blues lover's collection. Thank you Colin and his band."
4,National Steel....National Treasure!,"I really would like to give this 4 1/2 stars, but just can't see 5. Rollin' Stone and Fixin' to Die, just don't get it for me, but National Steel and Before the Dawn showcase Colin's amazing talents. Two other fantastic cuts are Sombody Have Mercy and Please Baby. All in all a great CD for the Blues fan or someone who simply enjoys listening to a truely great guitar player."
5,Helps keep urinary tract healthy,"This product is part of my ""wholistic"" regimen to keep UTI's out of my life forever! Used it regularly when fighting off the last of a series of problems - now only need it very occasionally. Excellent form of d-Mannose."
3,I'm buying relief & time....,"I too, have been hammered by UTI's. Countless DR, specialists visits & $$$... I am doing everything I'm supposed to do short of locking my husband out of the house - Women, you know what I mean!I'm hoping for the best but will be prepared for the worse (ANOTHER DR visit $$$).Will keep you posted."
1,Using hot water is cheaper and gives the same results,"This stuff just doesn't work! After using it for a couple of months I noticed that my mugs were building up brown tea stains inside, and flatware usually came out with a film on it that looks like it wasn't rinsed clean.There's no problem with my dishwasher, because when I switched back to Cascade, the brown stained mugs got clean in one wash, and flatware comes out clean the first time.P.S. I'm getting much better results with other Seventh Generation products; their liquid dish soap and their spray surface cleaner both work fine."
5,Love this stuff!,"This is THE only dishwasher detergent I will use. I am sensitive to some chemical ingredients that give me headaches in normal dishwasher detergent, but this stuff doesn't make me sick. I love how it cleans the bottom of my pans that are copper-- they come out shining! No film residue and it doesn't take much (I use about a TBSP) to wash a load of dishes and I wash 2+ loads a day with my family of 8."
2,Not Ready for Prime Time,"I use this for washing full loads of wine stemware (which is essentially clean when it goes in the dishwasher) and it does a good job with that. But it is *awful* at washing dirty dishes. It leaves food stuck to dishes. And no, this is not a matter of my ignorance using a dishwasher. The same dishwasher using the same techniques -- quick pre-rinse; no dried-on food --yields perfectly clean dishes every time when I use Cascade (and has for years). I like being green when practical, but pre-*washing* dishes is not practical."
5,Great gift for the music lover,"This isn't for all age groups, but was a perfect gift for the ""hard to buy for"" guy over 50."
1,Britney Spears,"Yep, she's on this list...as well as many other mediocre/horrible musicians. That's beside the point though. This is honestly a waste of money. Save you self some bucks, time, and shame by checking this list out on google."
3,"MOVE OUT OF THE 1960s, PLEASE.","Fun reading, covering the decades from the 1950s into the 21st century, but I have some serious disagreements with many of the LPs listed here.The editors and authors are obviously baby-boomers who never got past the Summer of Love mentality. There are WAY TOO MANY releases from the late 60s that are fawned over. The Electric Prunes! Come On! And NOTHING by Ravi Shankar is a ""must hear"". Ravi's best release was the sperm that created Norah Jones.However, I do have to make this sobering observation: I have listened to more of the 1950s releases than I have the 1990s releases."
2,No Cher. No Musicals. No Good,"I have 3 books of series (books, movies , and this one), this one by FAR is the worst! I mean the selections they have there are totally unreasonable. I mean, you CAN'T die listening to some CD by ""Korn"" but you can perfectly die without listening to Cher's ""Believe"". I am a big ""Cher"" fan and there were none of her CDs in here. They should also have some musicals in there like ""Evita"", ""Phantom Of The Opera"", ""Chicago"" ,and ""Wicked"". But seriously no Cher!?!?!?!?"
1,And where is Beethoven?,"Ayuh......so how come Beethoven, Chopin, Brahms aren't on the list? I think I can die happily without hainvg listened to Michael Jackson, thank you very much..."
1,Profoundly misguided - authors lack understanding of Western Music History,"This guide is useless. Do not read it. The period it covers is highly over-rated. While some music from the last half of the 20th c. was important, most of this period can be disregarded. In 200 years no one will recognize Rolling Stones or Bob Dylan.The last half of the 20th c. was a mostly unredeemably coarse age for music.Mick Collins"
3,Interesting but seriously flawed and unbalanced,"This is an interesting book, if you're unfamiliar with alot of indie music and 80's underground and British stuff. The book loses total focus when the nineties start, however. The most painful omission is Tool, the most painful inclusions are Limp Bizkit and Britney Spears, among many others. Despite being the supposed work of many people, the book seems an awful lot like one (very knowledgable) person's list of individual favorites. It seems every thing Brian Eno was ever involved in, with Roxy Music or solo, is in here, as is every Radiohead album, every Coldplay album and just about every Smiths album. Heavy music is pretty much omitted from the latter half of the book, with grunge and nu-metal getting a few scattered mentions. That this book has no Tool album in it forces me to give it no higher than 3 stars. I did learn alot from this book, however, about albums I was unfamiliar with and genres I didn't know much about."
4,Interesting,"While it's not a perfect list, it's an interesting book with some good albums listed. One of the good things about it is that it doesn't stick to one genre or only to a few bands. It has rap albums, techno albums, rock albums, pop albums, many kinds. Though it isn't a really perfect list, I can think of many albums that would fit in the list perfectly, and it's a mystery why Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake are in it. But all in all it's an interesting book and has made me delve deeper into my parent's CD and Vinyl collection to find some gems."
1,Racist take on modern...and classic music,"This book starts at 1956 - the beginning of the LP record. This is the last fair treatment of album music this book gives our American music history.I have just finished reading the book and listening to...all of the music up through 1969. Interesting that not ONE album from Motown is mentioned. However about 30 come from the British invasion. Before the Beatles, there were the Supremes who were the biggest force in American music, and groundbreaking race breakers. No mention. Marvin Gaye...no mention. But every psychadelic crap artist is listed, including imitations from Britain, where the psychadelic movement was an imitation anyway. I'm inclined to believe that intense druggie music writers compiled this book. Alas, the General Editor is from Rolling Stone magazine.Very disturbing, and very poor example. He should have thought this through a bit more before printing. Now, I can't read anymore of it now that it's obviously a complete farce."
4,Entertaining book with some errors,"In the review of Miles Davis' Kind of Blue (p.42), considered by many one of the greatest jazz albums, the reviewer SJac writes, ""the haunting 'Blue in Green' with Wynton Kelly's subdued piano accompanying Davis' mournful trumpet."" Bill Evans would have a heart attack if he were alive since he played piano on all the tracks except ""Freddie Freeloader.""Other than the errors, this is an entertaining book that raises awareness of many great albums."
1,American-UK center of the world,"Come on, there is better and original music else where on the world than in UK and USA. COME ON! On the Muldial Ranking of Music, Where do you put albums from other countries with even a richer musical background( India, Japan, All Asia, Africa, South America), They pretend that all the music that you have to listen before you die comes from UK and USA. hahaha"
4,good compilation,I love this book. Whether you agree with their choice of albums is very personal. I am using this as a great resource and as a result am learning about music I never even thought to listen to. This is also a great gift for someone's library.
3,satisfaction,I am satisfied with the purchase of Pre-algebra. In excellent conditions and worth its price. The shipping target was excellent.I recommend this seller.Thanks in advance.Debra!
3,Impact taste,Got it to try for a secret to a secret recipe but it is overwhelming. Haven't given up on it but not what I wanted. It definitely kicks it up with the 5 spices.
1,Disappointing,"Filled with trite, soap opera dialogue and your obligatory love story. Even the technological descriptions are vague and boring. I got burned out on Dean Koontz after his book's characters all started to sound the same. This guy is a poor man's Dean Koontz. There is nothing about the story, dialogue, or background that makes this book worthy of the claims on the cover."
4,"""Not the best Pitt book, but still enjoyable""","Cussler comes up with an interesting scheme involving a Chinese shipping king's illegal immigrant smuggling operation and a plan to foul up the Mississippi River. Some good action, especially with the chase on Orion Lake and the battle between a suped up intelligence gathering ship and a Chinese frigate. As usual, Dirk Pitt is Mr. TCOB, Inc. But I thought the characters could have been handled a little better. I also did not hate the main villian, Qin Shang, like I did many other Cussler villians. Plus, Shang lacked a prevalent cadre of henchmen. There didn't seem a real sense of how evil these guys were. Still, an enjoyable read and a very interesting plan for the Mighty Miss. Again, Mr. Cussler gets an ""A"" for imagination."
2,Flood Tide doesn't hold to the Dirk Pitt tradition,"I've long been a big fan of Clive Cussler's work, but this onejust doesn't cut it as a good story. Most of the other Dirk Pitt adventures were fast-paced and full of surprises. This one was neither. I had to work to finish this book, much as I did when reading the first few hundred pages of War and Peace. It lacks brilliance, and I (correctly) figured out what would happen after reading about halfway through. It's also got some elements that are, to say the least, slightly discriminatory against Asian peoples. What I do like about the book is that it seems Mr. Cussler has finally got his military information straight. I always found it a source of amusement when he described weapons and units that are completely nonexistent. Hopefully, the next adventure will retain these improvements."
1,Pitt is the Pits,"This was my first and definitely last Cussler book. I could barely finish it. I'm all for escapism and fantasy but there's no need to be stupid about it. The guy isults ones intelligence. I am amazed that this guy sold a single book, yet alone 90 million."
1,disturbing negative stereotypes of asians,"I've enjoyed a couple of the Dirk Pitt novels. Not exactly high literature, but fun in an 'over-the-top' sort of way. This one I put down after I was turned off by the anti-asian tone. It was difficult to know if he was talking about the Chinese bad guy or Chinese in general. His comment slamming Chinese music was the final straw. Unnecessary and stupid."
1,Hey Clive - Go back to writer's school,"I started reading Clive Cussler's books with Raise The Titanic. It was a new spin on writing. But as his style ""matured,"" the writing went downhill. He made himself a minor character in the series. Then a not-so minor character. Then a major player. What an ego! Along the way the writing became cookie-cutter, and the imagination and uniqueness that made the books stand out slowly disappeared. The plots became totally predictable - no surprises anywhere. We knew how the book would end somewhere near the middle. I could not even complete this book. I swore to myself that his previous novel was the last I would read. I should have stuck with that promise to myself and saved the money. Good-bye Pitt and Cussler. You had a good run. Hang it up."
5,Great Book,"Having been to the South and to New Orleans many times, this one was really fun to read as much of the setting takes place in this locale. All of Clive Cussler's novels have been superb, so far."
4,Wow!,"Mr. Cussler is a world class storyteller. This book, ""Flood Tide"" is a page burning masterpiece. Well done sir! Rev. Dr. Roger R Dodds"
4,Entertaining.,"Another Dirk Pitt novel. Dirk & Al really manage to getaround, and their adventures are imaginative and enjoyable. I read for pleasure, not to look for hidden moral lessons or other redeeming factors in a story. I know Pitt will win out in the end and I enjoy, through reading, watching him get there through all the plot twists. Mr Cussler has exceptional knowledge of historical nautical events and through the Dirk Pitt stories shares them with us. This book did not let me down, It was enjoyable, kept me turning the pages wanting more. I sincerely hope Mr Cussler continues writing about Dirk Pitt and writing himself into the stories, self-serving or not."
3,Slipped Two or More Notches,"I didn't find Flood Tide to be on par with any of Cussler'sother books. I thought the concept of the story to be a great idea however, I took offense to his portrayal of asians as a racial insult. It was as if this were written in the 1940's and typical of the Hollywood racial stereotypes. Not even Clive's beautiful heroine could be all Chinese (half/half). We've come a long way since then Clive, so lighten up!"
4,Cussler delivers as always but not his best,"I had read reviews of this book before reading it and was predisposed to not enjoy it as much as others. I did enjoy it, as always getting caught up in the escapism and the action; yes its been done before, yes the characters never change, the settings do, but as always its Dirk versus whoever and as always Dirk comes out on top, satisfyingly so. Not Cussler's best but for easy, fast paced reading, its good entertainment that will not disappoint"
3,Cussler seems to be reaching....,"Clive Cussler seems to have run out of plot lines. This latest in the Dirk Pitt series has a tedious, contrived plot that gets in the way of the fun. This is not one of Cussler's better Pitt sagas."
3,Clive is showing his age...,"What has always worked best for Cussler is Dirk Pitt -- a character he introduced to fans of the action genre over 25 years ago. The problem is that Dirk hasn't really aged or develop very much, revealing the author's fascination with youth and his own middle aged self-loathing; Cussler refuses to let go of his macho stereotypes, he seems fully entrenched in a world where every man has a full head of thick hair, gleaming teeth and a hair trigger! The only fobiles Dirk Pitt has developed is an antique car fetish and a fear of intimacy. Cussler is a fantastic and prolific writer but I cringe at some of his discriptions, his ethic stereo-types and his thinly veiled fear of human frailty -- subjects when shored up properly would make his latest work outstanding instead of mediorce."
3,"Not Cussler's best effort,","That about sums it up. Try one of his other books if you haven't met Dirk Pitt yet as this one might lose you. If you enjoy action, I recommend Bob Mayer's special forces series. Mayer is a former green beret who has written six books about special operations that are fast paced, accurate, and fun reads. Check them out!"
4,A must-read for Clive Cussler's crazy-adventure fans!,"It took me 3 good days to finish Flood Tide, 3 nights to think about the illegal immigrants, 3 hours to disdain the greedy chinese businessman, and 30 mins to fall in love with the beautiful half-chinese girl!! Dirk Pitt does it again with even-more supermanlike skills and pure luck. (But I think he overdoes it sometimes) Well...Inca Gold was good, Flood Tide was better!"
3,Drik Pitt at it again,"As with all Dirk Pitt novels, this is an enjoyable read but not as good as Cusslers four previous - Shock Wave, Sahara, Inca Gold or Dragon. I felt that this one was written more to give Pitt another lease of life than the creation of another Cussler masterpiece. If you are a big Cussler fan then it is worth the read, otherwise stick to any of the aforementioned titles, particularly Inca Gold."
2,Old wine in new bottle.,"After reading all the Cussler's Dirk Pitt stories, this one makes the story predictable. Unlike the stories like cyclops, I was able to predict what happens next with out having to peep at the later pages. I am not sure if this is because I read all of Cussler's novels and am able to catch his rhythm. Dirk is being made more and more invincible, which makes it more of a fantasy tale than fiction. As usual, a new comer will like the novel, but for someone who has already read enough of Cussler's novel, this will be a big big disappointment."
3,Only a fair Dirk Pitt Adventure,"The story was only fairly written, I felt that while the story line was well researched, the plots were tired and repeated from other stories. Instead if Dirk being rightous and good he is becoming arrogant and vigilane like in his activities.In some was this story confuses Dirk with Superman.I feel Clive has produced a book more for commercial reasons than literary reasons."
5,A great read.,"While not Cussler's best, this novel won't last more than a night or two. Dirk and Al remain as indestructible and uncontrollable as ever! The plot is more realistic than most of his past books, but lacks the non-stop, can't put it down action of some of his previous offerings. It's still worth the money for a great read."
4,Cussler is back,"After being let down by 'Incan Gold' and 'Shockwave' Cussler has come back with a good story. Dirk is his usual ""role model"" self and the villian is enjoyably evil. The plot is timely and borderlines on believability. It is also good to see that Cussler remembers the Great Lakes and the contributions they have made to increasing the number of shipwrecks. This is the perfect gloomy day book. If ""Promise Keepers"" didn't inspire your manhood, this surely will."
2,I expected more.,"Flood Tide was my first foray into the world of Clive Cussler and Dirk Pitt. I expected much more from such a prolific writer, but what I found were contrived plot lines, underdeveloped characters, and prose loaded up with cliche phrasing (She stared up at him with pure hatred in her eyes), and way too many adverbs. I get tired of characters saying things caustically, shrugging smugly, and muttering contemptuously (all of which occurred on just one page: 78). I got to chapter 18 before I decided it wasn't going to get any better and put the book down. Thank God the copy I had came from my public library. At least I didn't waste any money on it."
4,Another excellent Dirk Pitt adventure tale,"Pitt is back with his trusty companions trying to thwart the evil plans of a Chinese madman whose intentions of diverting the Mississippi River. Coupled with a slave ring of illegal immigrants from China, a gang of ruthless killers stalking Pitt and a lovely Chinese American INS agent, Cussler weaves an interesting tale and even writes himself into this story that was both clever and humorous. Plenty of narrow escapes, witty dialog, a nefarious villian (but a close group of henchmen was missing) and a great story of a missing passenger ship fleeing the Communist take over of China and a fortune of vanished artifacts. Blend these together and it spells another terrific tale from Cussler. Not the best, but certainly entertaining reading and not to be passed over. Once again, Al, Sandecker and company work with Pitt who uses his charm, snappy come backs and his trusty .45 Colt to save the day."
1,A Little Too Self-Indulgent,"I used to enjoy Clive Cussler's novels; that is, until he started inserting himself into the story lines. Each time Dirk at some point has to take a break in his adventure to meet with some mysterious hermit-like fellow (Cussler) who just happens to be loaded with crucial information about the local area. In this book Cussler writes himself into the story line as the ""Bayou Kid""-- an old timer who knows every nook and cranny of the Mississippi swamp Dirk must investigate and who just happens to have a sophisticated and well-appointed undercover swamp boat (complete with comic relief guard dog) for Dirk and his lady de jure to borrow for his mission. Yawn! Cussler's habit of writing himself into the plot may have been cute the first time he did it, but at this point it's become downright annoying. Let Cussler have his fantasies--and his books--for I shall not subsidize him any longer."
2,"No, Thank You","I finished Flood Tide almost a year after I purchased it. Thefirst 100 pages were fine, but after that I had a tough time keeping my interest in the book, and that's uncommon for me. I liked the idea, but I didn't like the writing style."
4,still an entertaining read,"as a reader of cussler since discovering ""raise the titanic"" back in 1977, i eagerly await the release of a new dirk pitt adventure. and this book will satisfy the many longtime fans of the series hungering for more tales from cussler. however, for me, the last few books while still quite good, have not quite been on a par with his best work, from vixen 03 to roughly treasure. maybe i'm familier enough with cussler and pitt to anticipate where he's going, but it seems i can figure out where the plot is going, or how dirk will get out of his next seemingly impossible situation. perhaps it's because the plot twists are becoming too familier- dirk faces certain doom, wiles his way out of it only to face even greater odds. perhaps i expect too much. still, spending several hours with a new dirk pitt book is a very enjoyable way to spend an evening."
1,Eye opener,Not my favorite - used to be a fan - i found clive cussler's writing to show how full of himself and dirk he really is very pompus - i now dislike reading him because of his style in this book - his ego has finally exploded!
1,It's amazing!,"My title refers not to the book but to the idea that millions of people buy and, I suppose, read this kind of stuff. I made it to page 132 but could not bear to read another sentence. Mindboggingly unrealistic characters, dialogue, and action. Perhaps it takes a male reader to appreciate Cussler, Clancy, and Ludlum."
5,What else can you expect from this writer,"Is there a better action/adventure writer, anywhere? NO!!! Hollywood needs to consider a series of Dirk Pitt movies. The lines at the theaters would go for miles. Tom Selleck as Dirk Pitt, and Robert Forster as Giordino. I read and re-read Cussler's books, for obvious reasons."
4,Underwater Indiana Jones,"First it is a good read, it is set in interesting places (scenic northwest, Mississippi swamps / river, great lakes) and talks about interesting activities (Illegal Alien Smuggling, Ultramodern new harbour, Navigating the Mississippi, Navigating the Great Lakes, treasure recovery). However, after quick-reading the book, my impressions were too much like those of an Indiana Jones movie: quick action with the barest link between the scenes and a sense of outrageous disregard for even the most basic credibility. Dirk Pitt is too much the unkillable archetypal hero, with an archetypal ""Sancho Pansa"" sidekick and a loveable Dulcinea of Chinese descent. The archetypal villain Fu Manchu (Qin Shang) and his lieutenant are also true to type. For all these same reasons I would bet this will quickly become a script-book for a successful movie."
5,Adventure at its peak!,"Cussler has managed to do it again. His hero, Dirk Pitt, is themodern day James Bond. With his partners Al Giordano and Admiral Sandecker, the evil Qin Shang is no match for them. From Orion Lake to Pitt's climatic one on one showdown with Shang, Cussler takes the reader on a unsurpassed rollercoaster ride!"
3,Pulp Cussler,"As always, the joy is in the journey, not the destination.You know before you even turn the first page what the outcome is going to be, it's just a case of how we get there. In this case it's a cute chinese girl, a Dusenberg, and every type of marine vehicle - from a hovercraft to an enormous cruise liner. The bad guy (Qin Shang) is as rich and evil as ever and his cronies predictably dangerous and clumsy.I suggest you climb into bed with a cup of hot chocolate, turn on the reading light, and switch off your brain... Mr. Cussler will take over from there."
3,?????????,"Whatever the U.S.S. United States was up to on its voyage up the Mississippi totally escaped me. Even if it succeeded, it seemed to me that it could easily have been neutralized within a few days. The master plot of evil in this novel seemed to me, if it succeeded, would only have been a relatively minor inconvienence. Couldn't figure out what the big deal was all about. I did love the heroine though. The beginning of the tale was riveting. Thank you Mr. Cussler for getting me through these dark days of winter."
2,Didn't keep my interest - Plot unbelievable,This is my first Cussler book and I must say I was disapointed. The first couple of chapters kept my interest - but then I had to force myself to finish the book. It got very old to have the main characters get shot/stabbed/beat up etc. and be asked to go on to the next adventure immediately. I also didn't think it feasible at all that the research department that Dirk works for would be involved in ANY of the espionage type stuff that they were working on. The plot had possibilities - but I didn't like the style at all.
4,It makes you wonder how much is fiction,"If you are a long time Dirk Pitt fan, much of this book becomesvery predictable. It might be this predictability that kept me from giving this book five stars. But the story is action packed and raises a number of questions about things such as the influx of Chinese immigrants, both legal and illegal, into North America.As in all of his books, Cussler's writing style is easy to read and flavored with the right balance of humor, tragedy and adventure to keep you turning the pages."
3,Cussler should stop writing himself into the books,"As others have said, not the best of the Dirk Pitt books. But the thing that's really becoming irritating is how Clive Cussler thinks he's being witty by writing himself into the last 4-5 novels. It's stupid. It's contrived. It's self-indulgent. Stop it."
2,dirk pitt series,I have read several of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt books. I thought they were all pretty good until I noticed the repetitive pattern in them. They all involve Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino being in the wrong place at the wrong time and getting involved in some crazy guy's plot to take over the world. It is always the same. And as if to put the cherry on top it always involves a hopelessly boring section somewhere in the middle. I put this book back on the shelf after getting stuck in this one's boring section. However I have mainly been reading the later books in the series after having one of them recomended to me by a friend. But I have heard that some of the earlier books are much better so I think i will try those and see how they are.
2,Dirk Pitt is not Believeable,The biggest disappointment in this novel is the character of Dirk Pitt. He is a superman with no human frailties. The situations he gets in are preposterous. Suspend all rational thought if you want to enjoy this book.
1,Pitt is the Pits,"This was my first and definitely last Cussler book. I couldbarely finish it. I'm all for escapism and fantasy but there's no need to be stupid about it. The guy isults ones intelligence. I am amazed that this guy sold a single book, yet alone 90 million."
2,Bring back the Dirk Pitt that I know and love!,"In Clive Cussler's newest book Flood Tide, our hero Dirk Pitt is a tired shadow of himself. There is little excitement or derring-do in this latest adventure (so-called) novel. A very political story line spoiled this book for this reader. I read Mr. Cussler for the adventures that Dirk, Al and Rudy experience. Give me treasure hunts, fantastic sojourns and less reality, please. I strongly suggest that anyone interested in trying one of Mr. Cussler's books for the first time skip this one and start with an earlier and far better story ie Treasure or Sahara (the best he has ever written, in my opinion). Flood Tide is best left as a last resort."
1,Skip this one,"This is the first Cussler novel I ever picked up and I have to admit I couldn't finish it. The plot is inane and the dialog is simply terrible. How does tripe like this make it into print? Can't the guy afford to hire an editor? Is he holding the publisher's family hostage? I gave it one star because the system didn't offer any fewer. Do yourself a favor and read Graham Greene or V.S. Naipaul, not this crap."
3,Typical Dirk Pitt Adventure,"Flood Tide is your typical Dirk Pitt adventure. If you are looking for something more, look elsewhere, however, if you've enjoyed past Pitt books, you'll like this one. More of the same, with the exception that Flood Tide is slightly more ""real"". In other words, I finished the book without saying ""I can't believe Dirk survived in the heart of a nuclear explosion"", or ""I can't believe Dirk lived after swimming 50 miles of an underground river."" :-) I enjoyed reading it."
4,Cussler is Always Fun,"One reads a Dirk Pitt adventure for a fun time. Farfetched plot, laughable dialog, stereotypical characters - it's all here and more as Dirk and Al save America from another evil mastermind out of a 1940's casting agency. Those who are fans will forgive Cussler for this less- entertaing- than- usual effort and enjoy it like a visit with old friends. It is not great literature, just good fun."
4,A Rip Roaring Adventure,"Yet again Clive Cussler hits the mark. Another stormer of a story, that might not be far from the truth. Who's to say the Missippippi couldn't be re-directed. Our hero Mr Pitt is on hand to save the day. A great adventure for all DIRK PITT fans. You'll love this one"
2,Flood Tide doesn't hold to the Dirk Pitt tradition,"I've long been a big fan of Clive Cussler's work, but this one just doesn't cut it as a good story. Most of the other Dirk Pitt adventures were fast-paced and full of surprises. This one was neither. I had to work to finish this book, much as I did when reading the first few hundred pages of War and Peace. It lacks brilliance, and I (correctly) figured out what would happen after reading about halfway through. It's also got some elements that are, to say the least, slightly discriminatory against Asian peoples. What I do like about the book is that it seems Mr. Cussler has finally got his military information straight. I always found it a source of amusement when he described weapons and units that are completely nonexistent. Hopefully, the next adventure will retain these improvements."
4,Great read....,One great read from start to finish....I have only read a few Cussler books and so far I am very impressed. He really draws you into this story from the beginning and it's one of those books that you just can't put down. The storyline really makes you stop and think about how lucky you are not live in a communist country with a billion other people.
2,"No, Thank You","I finished Flood Tide almost a year after I purchased it. The first 100 pages were fine, but after that I had a tough time keeping my interest in the book, and that's uncommon for me. I liked the idea, but I didn't like the writing style."
5,Another good Dirk Pitt story...................... Thanks,"Like others have mentioned, I had to get out the maps to see if Clive had it right. Of course he did. Whether it's the desert or the ocean, your research is amazing. Thank you for a great series. I can't wait for the next one."
3,Politacally Incorrect,"I believe that the premise of this book is an intriguing one, but I believe it portrays the Chinese in a terrible way. I believe that this is one of Cussler's better efforts, but not as good as Inca Gold or Sahara which I enjoyed a great deal. Cussler doesn't pull any punches in this book. The Chinese characters seem to be cookie cutter stereotypes. I believe Cussler could have made a greater effort in making his villian in this story a greater counterpart to Dirk Pitt."
5,They are all great,"I have read every Cussler book about Dirk Pitt, for two reasons. One I love the plots and heroics, two I love the fact that the characters never change. I enjoy being able to read more about Pitt and Al than just one book would provide. To me the worst thing about reading a book is never seeing what happens after the book ends. In these books you can always read the next one."
1,Cussler is getting too predictable,"Now let us imagine how CLive Cussler wrote this book:""Well, I need some new geographical area I have not talked about before, we had Japan, we had South America, we had Middle America, we had Africa, yeah, we should do something about China. Let us put something in there which is historical: The Peking Man (Question to the dear reader: Who knows anything about the peking man being lost ? Who cares ? What happened to the beautiful legends Cussler used, like the Cyclops, the lost library etc ?) Let us put something in there which is ultimately xenophobic and of course, I have to turn up in that book as well (as I did in Dragon, in Inca Gold, and most of my last book)."" Put this into my word processor and what do you get? ""Flood tide"". How ultimately boring this is getting. Everything is too predictable, this definitely (so far) is the worst of the Pitt Novels. Try, for a change, something new, Mr. Cussler."

Try, for a change, something new, Mr. Cussler."
5,First-Rate Thrill Seeking Adventure,"Floodtide was the first Clive Cussler novel that I have read, and it has convinced me to read more! I liked the characters (definite parallel to James Bond characters), and the numerous plot twists within the story. I also appreciated Mr. Cussler's attention to detail in describing locations and certain mechanical devices related to deep-sea diving. I am looking foreward to the next Dirk Pitt novel with great anticipation."
3,More Romance Less Clothes,"I like Helen Bianchin but the development of the romance, love, and conflict of the two characters was missing in this story. The constant focus on the attire, hotels, and other expensive items overshadowed the characters. Tell me why he let her walk away, why did she walk away, and why did he come after her? The ""deal"" was too contrived and I didn't really care for either character."
2,The Marriage Deal,lThis book was not up to her standard.I got tired of the repetision. Helen Bianchin's books are usually much better than this one.
3,Not her best work,"I agree with the other person who reviewed this book. I first read Helen Bianchin about 7 years ago when I read a book by her that my grandmother had lying around. When I rediscovered her last year I was elated because I had really enjoyed her work. But ""The Marriage Deal"" was disappointing and I hope the next one is up to snuff."
4,"I really don,t like giving reviews !!",could I unsubscribe giving reviews ? I really enjoy Mills and Boon which do not seem available on Kindle ?
5,Wonderful product,"We love sugar free Torani syrups. Now Strawberry Sugar Free is our favorite!! We are putting it in yogurt, and making smoothies!!! It's great. And the best thing of all....it is sugar free. It still tastes wonderful."
4,Delicious,makes delicious fruity drink when mixed with seltzer and a slice of lemon or lime. I no longer purchase sodas.
3,color,"I think it was a nice canopy, however, the color was totally different from what it looked like on website. It's a bright pink and it looked like a real light pink on the computer which is what I wanted."
4,Illuminating,"Davies provides a new fresh translation and just enough commentary to help the reader do their own pondering of the mystery sayings found in the Gospel of Thomas. The translation is certainly more readable than the SV (Scholars Version) which is more interested in the historical Jesus than it is in the Gospel of Thomas itself. Davies allows Thomas' Gospel to speak on its own terms, and in doing so liberates for us another voice that witnesses to a part of the early church community.I found Davies' explanation of the two creations very helpful in understanding some of the logia in Thomas' Gospel. Sometimes, though, I found myself wishing for more commentary than is provided. For example, I hoped for more references to better understand the Greek and Coptic texts.Overall, though, this is a wonderful book for devotional meditation, for better understanding of, and a greater appreciation for this ancient gospel."
1,The gospel of Thomas,The Gospel is wonderful and this translation is OK. The comments however are strictly academic. He just doesn't get it.
2,Mildly Ripped Off,"This book is a rip-off. The actual Gospel of Thomas could have fit into a 10 page manuscript, but was instead chopped into little sentences in order for this publisher to rake in the dough. The gospel itself is interesting but the commentary is only sparsely enlightening. It helps to have some context for a few of the more esoteric of Jesus' sayings. But the author's notes are often overly simplistic, and their tone is pedantic. I felt talked down to as an informed reader. Don't waster your $17. Find the gospels online and let them do the talking."
1,Drunken Writer,I got the impression that this writer must have been drunk the whole time he wrote this. It doesn't make any sense.
1,Counterfeit Righteousness,"The Thomas gospel text is often silly, occasionally contradicts itself, and obviously attempts to mislead the gullible. The commentary on the text attempts to soft pedal obvious flaws of logic, and ignores reworkings of quotations that are presented in the universally accepted Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John."
5,This book helps us understand another facet of Jesus's message.,"This book was very meaningful for me. I believe ""The Gospel of Thomas"" should be included within the NT. Jesus demonstrates his depth of wisdom by presenting sayings that are difficult to understand, causing each reader committed to ""seeking"" to go through an astonishing self-discovery with Jesus's promise that ""finding"" develops tremendous powers within the ""finder"" to influence and transform reality (""move mountains"")."
4,Just churchin' by Dr. Bobby Jones,"I love the old gospel music, so If you are not a fan of old fashion gospel, this CD may not touch your spirit. I love the track ""he will carry you."
4,SPIRITUALLY UPLIFTING,THE BOBBY JONES SHOW IS VERY SPIRITUALLYUPLIFTING AND IT REMOVES ANYTHING PRESSING ON YOUR MIND AND GIVES YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE IN PRAISING AND WORSHIPPING THE LORD. YOU HAVE THAT IMMEDIATE PEACE AND CALMNESS THAT COME OVER YOU WHEN YOU ARE PRAISING THE LORD. AND YOU MAY HAVE NEED THAT ENRICHED ATMOSPHERE IN YOUR IMMEDIATE ENVIROMNEMT/SURROUNDINGS AT THE PARTICULAR TIME. IT MIGHT A WAY TO GET YOU REFOCUSED DURING YOUR WEAKEST MOMENTON THAT EARLY MORNING JOURNEY OF GIVING THE LORD HIS DAY AND TIME. SINGING AND DANCING UNTO THE LORD IS BIBLICAL AND WEALL HAVE AND WILL ONE TIME OR ANOTHER. THANK GOD FOR BOBY JONES AND HIS MISSION.
1,BOOM!,"Bobby don't make no more cd's somebody should pull your pants down and spank your naked behind for making this cd. You cannot sing. And what's up with these new ""New Life"" singers? Git rid of them please. What happend to Angie, Francine, Beverly & Nuana Dunlap? I see you still got Emily up there. We love you Dr. Jones but the truth hurts and you cannot sing."
3,English-Shona Dictionary Review,"I wish it was a Shona to English dictionary in addition to English to Shona, but otherwise I really like it. It arrived really quickly. I'm very satisfied with my purchase."
5,Love this series,I love The Universe series....It is awesome....I hope they have another one next year. I have all 6 seasons and it never gets boring.
4,Good But...,"... Lose the ""Top 10 countdown"" lists... this is intriguing science, not David Letterman.The entire series is engaging, though not quite as intriguing compared to Through The Wormhole. Each successive season seems to build upon the most recent scientific revelations, and so it is quite enjoyable to revisit various subjects in later episodes."
5,Collection of his newspaper column,"I loved reading Maxes stories in the canadian newspaper. If you want to know what this book is like try doing a search on Max Haines, and I am sure some archived stories must still be around. The focus will be more on story telling and less on scientific fact, Max takes old cases and breaths life into them, it is 100% accurate probably not, but it does make good reading."
5,Good stuff!,"Writers on Writing is full of tibits on how to write both fiction and nonfiction and how to get published. No matter if you are just beginning your writing career, or have been published--you can learn more about the craft of writing through reading this book."
5,love it,I love this book! It's amazing and a great read on a rainy day when im feeling depressed! I shared a link about Scientology that u may find interesting[...]
5,"A Basic Moral Code, Which Leads to Happiness!","I am a volunteer supervisor for Criminon, which is a program that takes prisoners through an extension course on this book. I have seen miraculous changes in the attitude and behavior of these students. This book gives them a chance to learn a basic moral code that they can then apply to their lives. Through this they learn the meaning of happiness. It is a rewarding job"
5,Great common sense moral guide!,"This book is really wonderful, in that it provides what is lacking in today's nonreligious culture. This moral code is up-to-date, and the concepts will not become outdated. ""Do not tell harmful lies"", ""be faithful to your sexual partner"" and ""try to treat others as you would like to be treated"" are codes that we can live with, despite the culture we live in!I recommend this book to anyone."
4,Very Practical and Sensible Advice,"This book contains very practical and sensible advice about how to be happy. I'm not at all religious nor do I follow any of L. Ron Hubbard's religious beliefs so this was not a consideration for me. I was just curious about the contents and I'm satisfied it's all around good advice on how to live. Of course, isn't that what all religions and belief systems should teach anyway?"
5,A Must Read For All,This very simple and easy to read book can be life changing. Its simplicity is its beauty.
1,"Pictures are very fuzzy, pass this one up.","I first tried taking pictures in Auto mode but those did not turn out very good. I then spent some time tweaking all the settings in Manual mode but nothing helps, the pictures this camera takes are fuzzy and extremely poor quality. Though the product comes packaged well and includes all the little extras (cables, case, strap, batteries) I would not recommend this product even to first-time or casual users purely because of the poor quality pictures.This was an impulse buy because of the price but I'm taking it back to the store first chance I get."
4,Alpaca Book 1,"I bit higher level reading than I expected, but wonderful condition and a good book. No real complaints."
1,Annabelle Alpaca Travels to Peru,"I found this book to be poorly written and with several errors. For example, on the page titled ""About Alpaca's"", the plural of alpacas should not have an apostrophe and cushing should be spelled with a c not a k! I noticed that Jan's website also has the incorrect spelling of the plural of alpacas."
4,Tomb of Terrors 50 movies,"I really love these B-Horror movies! All the movies in the set were exactly what I wanted, bad acting, paper monsters and funky sexual behaviors! Keep 'em coming I will buy as many as I can! After a while though I start getting doubles of movies, but I keep them for a rainy day! I highly recomend this Movie pack to anyone who loves the B-Horror Movies and has a lot of time on their hands!!!Randy and Rachel Grant"
1,Yawwwn....,"These movies aren't even campy, much less scary. The acting is not on par with the standard high school play; yes, it's really that bad. No entertainment value whatsoever. You will get more out of your twenty bucks by using it for toilet paper than you will from buying this dreck."
5,Old Testament study,"This book is helpful when undertaking an in-depth study of the Old Testament, especially when looking at the historical background of the writings. The photos and descriptions of ancient texts, cities and artifacts also added clarity."
3,Good but boring,"This book is kinda boring, i wish there was some sort of way that the ane texts would have some sort of commentary and if it has some more connection with the bibical writings, a correlation between the two would be more benefical to the biblical reader."
2,For mythological buffs!,"Readings... is a collection of ancient writings derived from the Babylonians, Egyptians, Assyrians, etc. that all tell of the mythological beginnings of the earth, mankind, and ancient history. The entire book contains these writings with some photos/lithOgraphs of their sources. Although it was required reading for my Christian Bible course, I found it totally un-Christian. If you are looking for truth or fact, I do not recommend it. However, if you are interested in what ancient tribes, peoples, fancied and wrote about, then you would find it noteworthy."
4,I would wait before buying this...,"Repertoire Records, of Gemany have remastered, in STUNNING sound, AAB, TOTC and SAOS in 2006.(REP 5078, 5079, 5080)I m certain this will get the same deluxe treatment soon, listed as REP 50 or 51xx, 2007.They come in a LP mini sleeve with a very nice insert.No FBI logo, no UPC code on cover-they put love into the above listed remasterings,and instead used a sticker on the outer cellophane wrapper instead."
2,Has Sylvia become a sell-out?,"Has mass marketing overtaken the true intent of her calling? I was really impressed by the content of her initial work. There is no doubt this woman has a tremendous gift. However, it seems she is now churning out some substandard crap. I found this one in particular to be a repeat (or suggesting you refer to another of her titles) of old stories. She also seems defensive throughout; trying to defend her views and beliefs. She claims to be open-minded but is rather critical of other viewpoints - especially if they are directed at her.Just give us the facts ma'am. Leave the preaching for your church and congregation.Check out her website...$$$$ Then tell me she is not selling out in the name of the almighty dollar.To quote U2 ""The God I believe in isn't short of cash Mister"""
4,Great Read.,"I really enjoyed this book. I didn't really like Sylvia Browne's other books, but this one was very fun to read. She discusses some haunting investigations that were so interesting. This book is a must read."
3,Not Read by Sylvia,"If you are like me, you love to HEAR Sylvia's voice and it is your main reason for getting her AUDIO books. The information in this book is 5 star, but unless you are blind, you might as well read the book because this is NOT narrated by Sylvia and lacks all the nuances of her wit and vocal style. Many of the reviewers here seem to have copied their reviews from the book to the CD or perhaps Amazon did so and that is why they don't mention this drawback."
3,Some interesting concepts,"I won't say I find all of Sylvia's ideas feasible, but it was certainly an interesting read.It's too bad more people don't have open minds when it comes to the possibility of life after death. Just making the information readily available is important. John Edward has done so much toward that end through Crossing Over. I understand he and Sylvia will be working together soon. Too bad Crossing Over was cancelled, although there is a grass roots effort through www.SaveJohnEdwardtv.com to return him to the air.Visit and sign the petition !!!"
3,Disappointing,"Out of the entire book, there was only one chapter that I enjoyed reading which was about celebrities who have died. She talks about Hitchcock, Marylin Monroe, Bela Lugosi and a few others. That chapter was interesting to read, but it still made me question her talents. In other chapters, she takes you deeper into The Other Side by detailing so called, true encounters, she describes visitations with ghosts, in-transition spirits and other troubled souls seeking peace and closure. She travels to locations as diverse as haunted homes and ships possessed by the forces who walk their deserted decks. Through these spiritual visits, she explains the reasons behind many of the world's most bizarre and mysterious hauntings. I was so disappointed when I read this book. I'm more skeptical of Syliva's ""psychic abilities"" that I ever was. While this is only the second book of Syliva's that I've read, I don't think I'll be looking for another anytime soon."
5,What a great book!,"The book takes you into the lives of the dead, it speaks of Elvis, Mrs.Monroe and I'll let you read the book to find out the rest. When I bought this book I could not put it down it took me 3 days to finish it. I was drawn into this book like a fly to a web I could not escape its words, it's style and the certainty of Mrs. Browne. It even speaks on how she met Montell. this book gets 5 stars from me it's one of her best works. The things you read in this book will not only shock the #$#$@ out of you it will amaze you! it's a great read!!!!"
1,Book Missing in the Great Beyond?,"The book never arrived! I contacted Amazon who told me to contact the seller, which I did. No response from the seller and no book! Very dissatisfied!I can't rate the book because it hasn't been delivered."
3,SYLVIA BROWN AGAIN,"AFTER YOU'VE READ SOME OF HER BOOKS, THEY TEND TO REPEAT THEMSELVES---STORIES ARE GOOD BUT REPETITIVE--I BELIEVE SYLVIA WAS TO THE OTHER SIDE"
1,Racist literature,"Jensen's book pictures white race as evil force of modern America. This is a racist, antiwhite book. White race has its own great achievements, which are not acknowledged in this book at all. For example, many white activists, such as the author himself, struggle for the rights of other races. Yet we don't see many non-whites who would lead such a struggle for the rights of whites.Don't buy this hate literature."
5,A great starting point,"This book is a good starting primer for those who are unfamiliar with white privilege. I especially like how the book is footnoted, so you can immediately look at his sources, and also how he suggests further reading. A must for every white person."
4,The Heart of Whiteness,"It's predictably laughable to see the self-righteous negative reviews of a work, though not perfect, nevertheless is courageous. I have grown up with, and have been negatively affected by the white supremacist attitudes ingrained in this country. It permeates every aspect of life, yet those who benefit the most, vehemently deny its existence. Of course, any system which places your group on top is worth fighting for. Who can be surprised at white males' use of every means at their disposal, i.e.(redlining, job bias, exclusive networking, full control of top corporate management positions, whining about affirmative action, benefiting yet complaining about illegal immigration, racial profiling, re-segregating the school systems, etc...)to maintain their place on top of the economic and social pyramid. This book simply proposes a bit of introspection and sensible awareness of the overwhelming privilege the white race enjoys."
1,How does it feel to be the problem? You tell us Jensen,This is garbage anti white literature. To read it you must already be brainwashed. But that's exactly what they want. That's who subscribes to this hogwash.
4,decent bag,"The bag is pretty nice. The pockets are generally big (although my size 10.5 cross trainers have difficulty fitting in one side-pocket when the main pocket is full). The side-pocket venting could be better. Also, the main compartment can be difficult to close: The flap that covers-up the zipper often gets in the way when I'm zipping-up. The one thing that really bugs me is the metal zipper pulls: When everything is zipped-up, they bang together when I walk, and it sounds EXACTLY like I have pockets full of change, and I feel like every panhandler is eyeing me."
4,When a congregation struggles....,"I think this book is great for bible study and helped me to see scripture from a different prespective. This is great for anyone who is experiencing congregational stuggles, not financially but spiritually."
5,very pleased with order,"My son wanted these for christmas, I place the order and recieved them 3-4 days later. He loves the shoes. I was surprised at how fast I got them and I didn't put a rush on them. Thank you"
3,Dysfunctional friends,"Four twentysomething men in arrested adolesence let foolish pride lead them to a hard fall in GRAVESEND, an interesting street picture. Without giving away what happens, I thought the film concluded too harshly, but such a story certainly challenges the filmgoer more than most commercial movies would. I'd compare GRAVESEND to GOOD WILL HUNTING for its theme of young under-achievers. But unlike GOOD WILL HUNTING, GRAVESEND offers no Robin Williams and no happy-happy, gonna-see-about-a-girl ending. See GRAVESEND."
5,Really Good Music!,"The music on this CD is outstanding. Although the movie could have done more to please us older Pokefans, (at least it's better than the show) this CD features great songs. Donna Summers' ""Power of One"" puts lyrics to the beautiful Guardian's Song of the movie, which is also in the CD (""The Legend Comes to Life""). O-Town's ""One Heart"" is equally beautiful. ""The Chosen One"" by The B-52's puts the Prophecy's words into a weird, cool techno-song. ""Pokemon World"" is an enhanced, and much better, version of the show's Orange Islands' title song. The songs ""They Don't Understand"", ""Blah Blah Blah"", and ""Polkamon"" are hillarious, so be careful not to burst out laughing while you listen on headphones; it tends to attract odd looks from other people. BEST POKEMON SOUNDTRACK! except maybe the 1st Movie's."
4,Alright CD not the best....,"I thought the cd was pretty good the only reason I even thought of buying it was Westlife. My favourite song is on this album! I love ""Flying Without Wings"" it is the sweetest, nicest song. I love how it is arranged the harmonies are brilliant. Mark has such a beautiful voice! I think that everyone should give the song a listen to. Westlife is very talented and they have great songs. I think the best part of this cd was ""Flying Without Wings."" If you like it I would buy their self-titled cd. Well, the rest of the cd seemed kind of boring...so I guess just listen to ""Flying Without Wings""! PS Nicky should sing some more he has a great voice!"
4,Pokematic on the power of 1,"I find it interesting. Polkamon is the reason I bought it. I like many other tracks like chosen one, blakh blah blah, comin to the rescue, dance of the bellosom, the legend begins, and a little of Pokemon world. Pokemon world isn't the remade version for the movie, so if you liked that version, it's great. The slow songs bored me though. It's good, but only if you are hard core Pokemon."
4,A worthy effort.,"With the likes of Weird Al Yankovic and Donna Summer, Pokemon 2000 - The Power of One blends inspirational tracks with uplifing pop tracks from today's up and coming stars.The movie's premise deals with one person's ability to make a difference in the world that they live in. The tracks on this CD underscore that premise with tracks that are uplifing and very positive. This is a worthy addition to any Pokemon fan's collection. Even if one is not a fan of this wildly popular craze, the CD has tracks from top name artists."
4,Mom and Dad approved,"My Pokemon-obsessed ten year-old borrowed this CD three times at the library. When the renewals were used up I decided to order it for his collection.What surprised me about this CD was that the whole family didn't mind listening to it over and over in the car. I have a short tolerance level for Pokemon. But this CD has some strong ""power ballads"", cute pop tunes and the very entertaining Weird Al Polka (everybody Polka mon-get it?) The song ""Blah, Blah, Blah"" humorously addresses all of the adults who don't understand the obsession.The production values are good too. Some children's CD's have second rate orchestrations, digital mastering, etc. This is a professional recording."
1,STUPID,"just some more lame bands like O-town,Westlife and Weird Al and some of the most untalented bands ever. POKEMON IS STUPID"
3,"It's OK, but could be better",It has less top-notch songs compared with the first CD (Pokemon: The First Movie).
4,The best of Dub music,"This CD was pleasently suprising. I expected nasty, icky dub stuff, but this music is actually pretty good..."
4,This book is good for people outside US,"I live in Asia. I watch a lot of movie that tell stories about court in America..but never really knew the system (trial jury...grand jury..) until I read the book..... thanks John.,,!"
4,A Time To Kill,"A Time to Kill starts out with a young African American girl who is only ten years old, and was rapedby two drunken and remorseless young men around their mid-twenties. The town of Clanton,Mississippi is mostly white reacts with shock and disbelief of the inhuman crime commited.A Time to kill is an excellent book to read, it is full of suspense. Read this book now by John Grisham; the best selling author of The Pelican Brief, and The Firm.I love this book because it is filled with suspense!"
5,A Time to Kill Is A Time to Read,"John Grisham has created a masterpiece. If you've seen the movie, do yourself a favor and read the book. You can feel the pain in Carl lee better than seeing it."
5,I hate it but I love it!,"It is my first John Grishams book. I get the book from myAustralian co-worker when come to US for a meeting. Thisbook turns me into a Grishams book fan overnight.The book is easy to read but hard to put down. It forcesmy hand to into a page turning machine. The characters inthe book can be found in real life. A kid, father, lawyer,judge, black folks, KKK members and journalists, all runinto each other life and create all the tensions and loves.It is a good book to read but you will hate it because itstop you from doing everything else."
2,"Entertaining, but I don`t support what happened","It was a well told story but I don't support what Carl Lee Haly did. I support the right to self-defense and the right to defend what's yours. I do not however support revenge. The difference between the two is like night and day. Had Carl Lee happened upon the two dirtbags raping his daughter and took them out (like a man in Texas did earlier this year), I would have admired that a lot more. And quite frankly I think that would`ve perhaps made for a good story.This whole book basically glorifies revenge and vigilante justice. The evidence against the two rapists were overwhelming. There is no way they would have skated.A story about self-defense and protecting your loved ones IMO has a much better message. This book was instead about revenge."
5,Wow!,"JG is the only author that is capable of writing on such sensative material, and yet still reach his audience in a compassionate manner. If you enjoyed the movie ""A Time to Kill"", you must read the book! The details within this piece provided me the experience of becoming a resident within this small communitiy in Mississippi!"
4,Nice,I orderd the book and got a good conditioned book. So I am convinced. I wanna buy another books in this company. ^^
5,Good Grisham book,"I haven't liked Grisham's newer books or the ones he writes in partner with another author. I hadn't read his first book and was looking for some good old fashioned Grisham. Crime, suspense and justice. A Time to Kill delivers. The uncomfortable subject of race in the south is at the center of this story and Grisham doesn't shy away from it. His characters have to explore tough questions and pass judgment on themselves and others."
3,John Grisham - A time to Killl,John Grisham has established himself as one of the premier American writers in the recent past. Almost everything he writes is gobbled up devoured by his fans and rightfully so. He has a great knack for drawing you in to the characters and then like a punch in the nose..he hits you with the hook. Time to kill already is a classic and will remain on the reading list for high schooler and collegiates for quite a while.
4,Grisham's Best,"""A Time to Kill"" is definitely Grisham's best novel. It's interesting that it was Grusham's first novel, but it was rejected for publication until after some of his other novels were published. The story deals with a number of issues that all intertwine seamlessly. Racism, murder, justice, revenge, law and order, etc. The story will hold you from start to finish. Most of Grisham's newer novels are simple, predictable stories that bash attorneys. That is not the case with ""A Time to Kill"". It will grip you, tear you and entertain you all at the same time."
5,My favourite Grisham,"Great book - beautifully paced, genuinely moving at times, and unlike some of his other works, completely unpretentious and totally satisfying. In my opinion - his best."
2,Lacking originality,"Certainly Grisham's best novel(excepting possibly A Painted House, which I haven't read yet), this appeals to the indignation we all feel at injustice in the world in general and specifically to that evoked by so much racial injustice in our country's past and by violence perpetrated on children. I am surprised that mystery and legal suspense readers don't recognize the plot, though. My belief is that very few people living today have ever had an original thought (and I seriously doubt that I am one of them). Yet the very striking similarities, the clear-cut parallels, evident when comparing this novel to Paul Travers' 1958 Anatomy of a Murder is uncanny, to say the least. I would be curious to know whether Mr. Grisham ever read that classic (also made into a movie)."
4,"Excellent book, bad language","I really am enjoying the audio recording of this book, but the one thing that really bothers me is the repeated use of the n word, to the point that it seems a bit gratuitous. I understand that sometimes authors feel language that is offensive is warranted for a period or regional piece, but I think there is a fine line between creating a sense of believability and just plain overdoing it."
5,Loved It!!,This is Grisham's first book ever published. One of the greatest storys I have read lately. Puts the reader on the edge of their seat
5,"""A Time to Kill"" is not just a book, it is history!","""A Time to Kill"" is the first and best book by Grisham. It is not just a book, it is a sad part of American history and unfortunately the American present. Racism, rape and the KKK will keep you up all night. You will be appalled and saddened by the statement this book makes about racism. The suspense is incredible. The crime is horrible. The book is awesome. You won't put it down until the last page"
4,A Black Man seeking Justice outside the system,"The continuance of racial discrimination in certain parts of the United States has resulted in the injustice of the system . Carl Lee , a black man sought justice for his young daughter outside the system when she was raped and tortured by 2 white men . It would take a miracle to save him even with a first grade lawyer ! Read It to find out for yourself !"
2,University Hard Cover Books,I was dissapointd to receive my order. I misunderstood what a university hard cover was. I have a collection of all John Grisham's books in hard cover The last one I bought was this university hard cover which turns out to be a paperback with a hard cove. Doesn't fit with the rest of my collection
5,A Must Read,"The book I read A Time To Kill was a phenomenal book it was an amazing story that could have happend to any one in the world. It was suspensfull and I could not put it down. In my words I think this book is about theese people that get ebtertainment out of killing people. In this book John Grisham writes about a little 10 year old girl from Clayton,Mississippi who gets killed by theese two drunken men and then they decide to get rid of her by throwing her in a stream. Then her father acguires an ausult rifle and takes justice into his own hands. This book is an amazing book that you will not put down, it is tense and emotinail and be prepared to cry.This is a great book for any kid or audult to read."
1,CRAP -- UTTER CRAP.,"Okay. Where do I begin? There are so many things wrong with this book. Grisham spends a great deal of time in this courtroom drama dealing with the protaganist's theory of defense in a criminal case. In the end, the theory of defense turns out to be irrelevant -- so the bulk of the book is irrelevant. Grisham introduces characters who are ultimately inconsequential. I kept waiting for the main character's law student sidekick to do something to justify her inculsion. In the end, she comes and goes without doing anything of significance. She could have been cut out of the book without the least impact on the story. If you distilled this book to its essence, you'd end up with nothing. Skip this book; your time would be better spent reading the label on a tube of toothpaste."
2,Dull and Boring,"A Time to Kill must have been one of the worst books that I have ever read. A Time to Kill is a book about two men that rape a little girl. The girl's father kills the two men, and risks going to the gas chamber. The reason I hate this book is plain and simple. I hate books about politics and court trials. A Time to Kill is just that, dull and boring."
2,Has to be Grisham's best--and that's not saying much,"The story does a good job of highlighting racial relation in the American Deep South, but that is about the only thing it does. Rather slow, it certainly did not hold my interest for very long. The best thing I can say about it was that the characters were more believable, not as cliched and certainly less hateful than in subsequent Grisham books."
1,BLAH!,This book was great at the beginning..but then at about the middle of the book it came to a haulting stop. I suggest that you go out and rent the movie. I couldn't even finish it...no matter how hard I tried!
1,Terrible!!!!,"I never recieved the product, and when I wrote to complain they said that basically, it cost them more to ship it than they actually made, so they aren't going to do anything about it."
3,I'm Lost,"The gripping suspense through out the book kept you turning. After reading most of the book, I realized that I had yet to come upon the conclusion. ""Why"" you ask? Well the last 15 pages were the conclusion. The verdict, his wife, Lucien, his law clerk was all answered in these 15 pages but left many holes! I wanted to hear how Carl Lee lived his life, what his wife's reaction was about her house, and what ever happaned to Row Ark! Yes we all know that she was in the hospital with her father by her side, but what now? Overall, for a first novel of a successful auther, the book was awesome. I just wish the conclusion would have been longer to fill in the gaps."
5,The best Grisham book yet to hit the book stores!,"Grisham shows his elagance for writting true novels with this piece of work. In this novel he shows that even wit and class can beat out the worst of evil. He shows true class with an ending like none other.The stores starts out in Mississippi where the daughter of Carl Lee Haley (Tonya Haley) has just been raped by two racial white men who don't care who they hurt. The sheriff goes, occuses them of the crime and they are arrested.I tell you that if you want the res of the story is brillant. Read the word but don't take my word for it!"
5,His first and best book of all of them,"This is the best book written by John Grisham. In this book he actually makes the reader feel as though they are part of the well written story. I have not read this book in quite some time but I remember much of the book, because it was a memorable experience being a part of the story. I was hurt to read some of the comments and to think some people thought it was ""crap"". I FEEL IT SHOULD BE MADE A CLASSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The only really good Grisham,"Back before Grisham got commercial, he wrote this book, and it is by far his best. Sure, it is a tale about race and racism, good and evil, and law and justice. But at its heart, it a tale of revenge, which is what animates the whole book. Otherwise it would just be another in a series of legal thrillers.Read this Grisham, you won't be disappointed. But don't expect it to ever be this good again."
4,His best.,"The story of Jake Brigance, a lawyer in small town Mississippi, is John Grisham's first, hirst first venture into the arena of professional storytelling, the vehicle that turned him into a big-league player in that very arena where few succeed, but those who do, often do so wildly; they get to play among the stars; they become one.Grisham describes, in a note to the edition I read (2009), how it was to peddle a good book on the back of a popular one (The Firm) and a slew of bestsellers that followed with the result that ""a good life became even better"".A Time To Kill is Grisham's best, by far, and he is the first to admit it. He laments the loss of Ford County and wishes he was back. He'd do well to take himself seriously and visit back, perhaps to stay. There's lots more there and he can, by his own account, afford it now. He has shown us that the proverbial grass is is not always greener on the other side. Sometimes there really isn't any grass at all."
5,Such a page-turner,"I'm not a fan of legal thrillers in general, but A Time to Kill is such a page-turner. John G really started a new genre with this book, and his subsequent novels. It's worth the read for that alone."
4,Very good condition and quick service,I was amazed at how quickly I got my book. The book itself is in excellent condition and is welcome addition to my library. Thanx!
2,A Time To Kill,The book was okay although a back top corner was broken. The jacket was in a very tattered condition. I have received a refund back from Amazon.com so I will try to obtain another copy at a later date. The service from Amazon.com was exceptional.
4,Very direct,"This book takes a very direct and open position on race and if a black man has the same right as a white man has. I randomnly picked this book out without really knowing what it was about, but I am glad I got it. It's worth it and you'll read through it quickly."
5,Wow!,"This is not just a book, it is a spectacle to behold. I was literally biting my nails as this book reached its climax, as Clanton, Mississppi, a small unsuspecting southern town becomes the home of the biggest trial in the nation. The racial tension is this book is palpable, and it is the driving force behind what makes this story so compelling. This small town becomes a virtual war zone. Fantastic! I can't even find the words to describe how amazing and unbelievable a read this was!"
5,Best Book I EVER Read,Great story. I couldn't stop reading it. It's a book where you say you're going to 1 more chapter but you read 5 more.
2,I was very dissapointed,"This is the second John Grisham book that I have read and found it very boring and very slow moving. During the first one hundred pages things are actually happening, but after that this book got very old, very fast.A young black girl gets raped by two white boys who are drunk and high. They get arrested after trying to kill the girl, and then the dad comes along and kills them both. Throughout the next four hundred pages it is all about the trials and tribulations of the black man and his lawyer.I would not recommend this book to someone who has previously read or this is their first John Grisham book. It is slow and looses you after page one hundred."
2,Binding not good,"I did not understand what ""turtleback school and library binding"" meant so I was not happy with how this book was bound and returned it."
3,a time to kill,A Time To Kill is set in Mississippi during racist times. The book a time to kill tells a story about a young black girl that gets rapped by two white guys. After the rape her the throw her out. Some people found her and took her home. Her father wanted to take justice into his own hands.One part in the book tells how he got revenge on the two white guys. He shoots them in his face on the stairs and then he is charged for murders of to white men. The rest of the book is mostly about his courts and if he's guilty or not.This book shows a lot prejudice actions and how the kkk was involved. I enjoyed reading this book and if you want to know more about racist times I recommend this book.
4,Bringing Out the Truth,"Readers who like crime and justice would love A Time To Kill, by John Grisham. This book describe in many details about racism between black and white people in a small town in Mississippi. It is about a trial of a black man who murdered his daughter's rapists, which are two white men. Most whites want him dead; but if it was a white man trial where he murdered a black man, he would be set free. Racism is very strong, and it could not be erased from these people. If you want to know what happened to the man who is a hero to his people and some others, but a devil to white people, read the book."
5,Wonderful!,"This is the first John Grisham book I've read and definitely his best. I started reading it at nine o'clock at night and stayed up till three to get it done. I loved it, I really did. Before I read A Time to Kill, things were black and white. Murder was wrong no matter what the cause. But now? I'm not so sure..."
4,Fatally addicting!,"This was my first book by John Grisham. It was very capivating, I had a real hard time putting it down. His writing is very easy reading and uncomplicated. The storyline is one in which as a parent you can relate to wholeheartedly. At numberous times I found myself getting very angry with the way in which the story characters were being treated, which is reality, but the outcome can be related to totally."
4,WOW,This is a book that if you can read it in more than one sitting I am shocked at you. This is a great Grisham book. Being his first I expected it not to be that good. But it seems from the being Grisham wanted to show the world who is king. It is about a girl who gets assaulted by some white folks and during their trial the father decides to ... them. Now it is a battle to determine if it was a legal move to do. They pleed insanity. And on top of all this the KKK is there. This book is everything that Grisham is I recommend it to anyone.
1,Wrong item sent,"Book was to replace one I lost that was loaned to me by a friend. Had it sent to them. What was sent was a ""Readers Digest"" type version. Very embarrassing and not what I thought I had ordered. If it wasn't a gift, it would be returned."
5,"Wonderful book, Movie is no comparison","This book was so much better than the movie. I read the book and was just absolutely in awe and couldn't wait to see the movie. The movie was disappointing in my opinion. The book is so much more discriptive than the movie. The book goes into character development and there are so many memorable moments that were left out of the movie. I would recommend this book to anyone, but I would warn future readers that there are a lot of racial references in the book and could be offensive to some people. It was a great book and John Grisham tells the story wonderfully."
3,A sensitive experience,I would have given it four stars had it not been for an exagerated preoccupation with drinking. This slowed down the rythm by spending page upon page on drinking and hangovers that added nothing to the essence of the story.
5,If only all of his books were this well written,Definitely the best Grisham book...and I have read them all (in the hopes that he duplicates the awesomeness of this one).
5,All I can say is Wow!,"How does Grisham do it everytime! Right when you think everything is okay, something big happens! Like his house burning down, or when the Ku Klux Klan took the law clerk. She was one of the main characters, who would have thought she was going to get hurt?"
4,Grisham's Debut,"A Time To Kill is the debut novel of the mega selling author John Grisham. Setting the basis of much of his future works, the book follows the story of a young Southern lawyer who has seemingly insurmountable odds stacked against him. Jake Brigance is the lawyer who represents Carl Lee Hailey in the small Mississippi town of Clanton. Carl's young daughter is viciously raped by a couple of rednecks. The rednecks are on trial, but Carl takes matters into his own hands and kills them. Carl is black and this incident has split the town along racial lines. Was is justifiable homicide or premeditated murder? Should he get the death penalty or be acquitted? Grisham is a lawyer so his intimate understanding of the way a lawyer approaches a case and how a trial unfolds is letter perfect. The book is a quick and easy read and highly enjoyable."
3,Much Much Better,"This album shows that No Authority has grown up in a way that most artist like to describe it. Their last album was full of ballads and up-tempos that just didn't catch anyone ear, except for their highest single 'Don't Stop'. This new album is now filled with great up-tempo beats like singles 'What I wanna do' and 'Can I get your number' plus 'Make you dance'. It delivers mid-tempo/mellow songs like 'Beautiful Girl' and 'I'm telling you this', and who could forget the ballads 'Faithfully' and 'Here I am'. Most No Authority fans are just happy that the boys finally got this album out after about a year delay. Still, NA is yet to find their way up to the higher 'boy-band' status like BSB, Nsync, and 98 Degrees...but isn't everyone else?"
1,Terrible,This CD is degrading. It rips me apart everytime i listen to it.There is little musical talent and just fun time.
1,do not buy this cd..,"i must warn anyone that is comtemplating buying this cd, do not do it.. i heard some of this album and i swear my ears actually started to bleed.. this is one cd you do not want to add to your collection. so dont say i didnt warn you!!casper"
1,Not for a serious puzzler.,"To be fair, this book does do a decent job of illustrating some useful, if elementary, techniques for solving popular classes of problems. However, most people who would find such a book interesting have already seen the old chestnuts in here and know how to solve them. A serious puzzler would rather complain about how the problems are ambiguous, well-known, trivial, poorly stated, and/or poorly solved. I'd recommend this to an elementary school teacher trying to teach a unit on logic. But for everyone else, I suggest looking elsewhere. Fortunately, I got my copy free from the publisher. To me, that's about what it's worth."
5,The forgotten building block of today's music,"In the past 60 years some famous artists and less famous artists have contributed in the sounds that we hear today. I consider this one of them. I bought this album some years ago on LP. When I left the store, some guy praised my choice ""Good choice"". Little did I know what to expect, I only knew ""I put a spell.."". I was blown away by this album immediately. The creation of new words that just sounded right, but absolutely weren't in any dictionary, such as Aligator Wine, and phrases that were starteling your ears just make this a very enjoyable album. As soon as I heard this became available on CD, I bought it. Jay has got me under a spell you know..... Watch out."
5,family treatment,"Great, no problems!However, the review process is time consuming and quite irritating to be honest. Got the book fine. How much can one say about a book experience, really?"
3,WTH?,"The previous reviews do NOT describe the product presented here...is there another album with the same name? I'd happily buy the set the other reviewers are talking about...on this one I'm just getting ""She Blew A Good Thing""..."
2,Expensive Alternative To a Free Version,"Ordinarily I would give the English Standard Version high ratings. It's highly readable, very accurate, evangelical, with a traditional flair.The only problem is that it's nearly identical to the Common Edition: New Testament that has been available online (for free) since the spring of 1999.Still, if you don't mind paying, the English Standard Version is almost as good as it's predecessor."
2,onion skin paper,"What I like: a good translation, cross references on each page, and a concordance in back. What I don't like: the paper is so thin you can see through to the next page--very distracting when you're reading. Why can't they use decent quality paper?"
4,Compact and savvy,"I think that this bible is great, it's compact, and savvy. It's nicely finished with a ribbon place-mark, has the words of Christ in red typing, and is small enough to carry in your handbag, though the font is quite small."
4,"The Down Easters, American Deepwater Sailing Ships 1869-1929","A great history of the Down East sailing ships including their captains, destinations, and comparisons to the Baltimore clippers. Of particular interest to readers of Patrick O`Brian`s Aubrey/Maturin novels."
5,Excellent coverage of typical viewpoints,"I am a nursing instructor and use this in my growth and development classes. It covers in 17 min. the typical viewpoints people give to justify spanking. It is a video that can be used in a class or by parents, themselves."
4,"Small space, right fit","This table was exactly the right size for the space available, by dropping oneof the drop leaves. One of the supports for the leaves was not a solid pieceof wood and came apart at one glued section. Had to get it repaired. Now worksfine for the particular space."
5,Bobby McFerrin The Voice CD,"VoiceMcFerrin's debut album is a real winner. If you love the voice as an instrument, you'll love this album. Before McFerrin got famous and fancy, this was his stand-out introduction to listeners. Simple and superlative."
5,An amazing tribute to the human voice,This is a truly inspired album that combines McFerrin's voice with several music styles.
1,AWFUL!,"A Bobby McFerrin song was used on a PBS special that I loved and so I thought I'd buy some of his CDs. For me, it turned out to be a huge waste of money. The PBS documentary must have found his one good piece..."
4,A purchase worth it...,"John has brought forward a number of real life parables to assist us in getting to the core of a common definition of courage. At times it might have been more useful to have fewer anecdotes and more of the blunt McCain we have come to know (and love). However, he appears to rally these thoughts in a powerful conclusion and makes the book a worthy read."
4,The last of the Samurai,"You have to have respect for this guy just for what he managed to survive. There aren't too many writers that can authoritatively whip off a book on this subject.McCain uses sharp and very elloquent English to account his experiences in the midst of courage greater than his own. He is modest and humble and, at the same time, his observations penetrate and enlighten with great effect.Very little of the book is about him directly. He speaks mostly of people he knows, respects and has learned from. From Eleanor Roosevelt to Roy Benevidez, numerous accounts of valour, honor, wisdom and raw courage are siphoned off from a master survivor.I may not be any more courageous now than I was before the read, but, what can I say...? A book that needs to be written needs to be read and I've got even more reasons now to respect political leaders that actually 'walk the walk.' Pity that so few of them are recognized now by the greater public."
1,This Book is Unreadable!,"Love John McCain. Don't love this book. Between wonderful stories of individual courage, this treatise on courage and what causes people to react without respect to fear is totally unreadable jibberish. It makes no sense at all."
3,Must have been ghostwritten...,"After all, how can it be that the author of ""Why Courage Matters : The Way to a Braver Life"" doesn't have the courage to stand up to Karl Rove.Sad, really.DCMCG"
2,Disjointed...,"This book is an interesting collection of stories of courageous acts. In between the stories McCain rambles about the meaning of courage. The ramblings sort of meander and are not well-structured. This would have been a better book if it were marketed solely as a collection of courageous stories, possibly including McCain's own story, and possibly with a BRIEF, cogent essay at the end on his thoughts on courage.I am an avid reader and a McCain fan, but this book was difficult, and boring to read, and brought him down a notch in my estimation. (My parents, both avid readers of fiction, non-fiction and biographies, passed the book on to me, and later confessed that they passed it on for the same reason)."
5,I absolutely LOVE this detergent!,"I got a case of the geranium detergent looking for an alternative to the all natural detergent I was already using (Trader Joe's). The one I was using just didn't seem to give a fresh look or smell to our clothes. I started using a half cup of vinegar in each load, which helped a bit, but with two boys and my husband and I being active with them (camping, biking, martial arts), we still ended up with some items that were too sweaty-stinky, stained to be handled by that combo. Mrs. Meyer's fixed that! Don't be intimidated by the smell of the detergent when you open it. By the time it goes through the washer and dryer you have a pleasantly subtle smell. Even when washing your clothes with stinky sweaty boys! I did the laundry from last weekend's camping trip and the caked on dirt and hot chocolate stains are history!"
5,Best detergent we have ever used,"Ok, so we have used almost every detergent known to man. We are trying to be more earth friendly and non toxic and bought a case of Mrs. Meyers based only on the reviews on Amazon. I have always had to soak dirt and grass stains in major chemicals. I used Mrs. Meyers lavender on a pair of baseball pants (white!), rubbed it in liberally and washed. This detergent actually got the stain out better than non enviro friendly detergents and chemicals! We will never use anything else. On our 2nd bottle in the case and can't wait to try the other scents too."
4,Great Abdominal and Back Support,I recently had Hernia surgery on 08/2010 and find this belt to be an exceptional abdominal support for me. The back alignment strips assist in a straight in line support for my back which I find to be very comfortable. I can wear my support for many hours in the day with little or no discomfort. Thanks for a great product!!!
3,did not fit right,"the instructions for wearing were not good. it did not fit right, unable to wear. wish i could return it"
2,UNSATISFIED,"I BROUGHT THIS BACK BRACE THINKING IT HAD BRA-LIKE HOOKS WHICH IT DID NOT. AFTER I TRIED TO WEAR IT, IT ROLLED UP AND PAINFUL WHILE SITTING IN THE DOCTORS OFFICE. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE OVER 150 LBS."
1,Not what I expected,"Know that feeling of disappointment you get when you take a chance and buy a CD because you like one song and you hope the rest will be as good? This is worse. It might be okay for background music in a club where no one's really listening. I bought it because I love the A3 song on the disc, or at least I thought I did -- it's nothing at all like the original version. Fans of techno synth experimentation may like this disc, as will those who think more bass will make anything a classic, but those who prefer more melody, lyrics and other, more ""pop"" musical attributes will not. Perhaps I'm just not cool enough to appreciate this."
2,cheaply made,"I bought this pan in order to make a panda cake for my daughter. The edges of the pan did not line up evenly, so I didn't even want to risk putting a cake batter into it. I figured it would leak all over my oven. The clips that came with the pan are extremely hard to get on to the edges, since they don't line up well. I will be returning this pan and buying a different one."
3,Reasonable Compilation,"This is a reasonable compilation of CH's GHs from 1967-1970. But although the blurb for this Disky release says its original release date is 1999, my EMI release copy says its copyright 1989 and it has a different title (""On the Road Again""). So if you collect compilations, make sure you don't already have it.I recently bought this in Melbourne Australia for $AUD[price] (maybe $USD[price]?). Its a useful addition to my 'shut out the office and boogie at the keyboard' collection at work."
3,"Fun to play with, but not for serious folks","This is an interesting way of learning some essences of wine. Unfortunately, because you have to drop it in water the ""flavor"" of the tap/mineral water has an effect. Use the same source always. It's really the nose that needs to learn, not the palate, but this is a good way to start and see if you have the ability to really distinguish things"
3,A bit of heavy reading,"This book about the Dark ages of Wales and Britain was interesting but a little heavy. With frequent Welsh wording and references, it was cumbersome. I enjoyed the story of Porius and his future bride and all of their complicated background but it is not easy reading and would not recommend it for the average reader."
5,Vietnam Snapshots,"Comments sent by readers to author: 1. What I found truly spectacular was that he was able to present many different situations and emotions of the war in a way that the reader could find interesting. 2. Dr. Etchison's book opened my eyes to the Vietnam War. The stunningly truthful stories brought me to tears. 3. I think the writer did a good job writing from both the American and Vietnamese perspective. I think all high schools should be required to read the book. I'm certainly glad I did. 4. The book gives the reader a clear idea of what the war was really like, and succeeds in arousing a good deal of sympathy."
1,What was the Message?,"Definitely not styled after Tom Brokaw's book The Greatest Generation, which accounts why the generation of the WWII era was one of America's finest. This movie was made with a sort of cynicism about our Greatest Generation that seems to only drain the audience's attention. By focusing too much on the 'bad' side of America during the War in the Pacific, Clint Eastwood overlooks the good that America can stand for leaving the viewer with their own battle fatigue. Jumping from the war to modern times and back again and again during the whole movie was like being drug through the mud having to endure another one of hollywood's cynical anti-American rantings.Poorly made and although it had potential, the movie will leave you wondering what message it is the viewer is supposed to swallow. The general message, I think, is: 'dislike your country for standing up to Imperial Japan, because underneath it all we were all just a bunch of jerks and that we should have lost'."
3,Too much bouncing around,"I'm a little bit of a history buff and like to watch movies about different periods of history to learn a little bit. I was disappointed with this movie. Seemed like we were bouncing around a little too much and it was hard to track events and people. In the end, I felt the movie was more about Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome than about Iwo Jima or the war.I would probably pass on this one and watch something else, unless you are really curious about it."
3,OK - but they should have stuck closer to the book,The book was excellent. The movie messes with the book big time. The book was pretty much linear in chronology. The movie jumps back and forth in time like crazy. Hard to understand the point - just confusing.
1,Movie was an insult to any service men and especially Indians.,"I would not recommend this movie to anyone except countries that hate America. It is a complete insult to the Marine Corps and and insult toIra Hayes and any Indian. Movie was not about Okinawa but the constantinsult to one man. Ira Hayes. I will not see his other movie,""Letters to Home'. I purchased both books and threw them in the garbage where they belong. It will glorify the Japanese just like it insulted a hero.Don't purchase either the DVD's or books unless you are Un-American.I do not know how the U.S. Government permitted these books to be released and movies made of them."
2,BORING AND DEPRESSING,"I like war films like Saving Private Ryan and Pearl Harbor, but I found this film depressing, hopeless (""everything is a lie!"") and downright boring. It seems interesting but after a while you just feel aweful about your own country and feel fooled. I love you Clint but you should have just changed directions of the film from the beginning"
3,a decent film about the greatest generation,"I wasn't blown away by this film. I thought it could have used some editing in places, no stand-out acting for me, served its purpose & told its story. I was kind of distracted by how goody-goody the main character was, starts feeling too cliche & wondered how that set with the descendants of the other less-than-valiant service members that hoisted the flag or from that company. On the other hand, I'm happy to watch any film made about this war & the sacrifices made. Definitely pulled my heartstrings & the checkbook to send a little something off to the Veterans."
3,"Good movie, horrible DVD","After watching this DVD, I am compelled to write this review, and I don't write many. First off, movie was good, but you can see that from other reviews. I am writing this to simply say that this DVD is horrible. there is absolutely no special features on anything. And if that isn't bad enough, the main reason that I write this is that there is not even a scene index on this DVD, so if you want to go to a certain scene, you have to fast forward. In this day, you think they would at least have the scene index."
4,"Nice, but flawed film","This movie was based upon a wonderfully patriotic concept...the raising of our flag and how this very action became a marketing tool even more important than the many men who sacrificed their lives. Of course, it was all about raising $$$ to fund the big V.As many others have pointed out, the problem with this movie is that it becomes somewhat confusing. This is often the reason why I prefer unbiased documentaries over these historical dramas. Out of respect for the men who fought at Iwo Jima, one should really do a bit of research and reading in order to give history the attention it deserves. This film could have been much better, but unfortunately it requires some polish."
4,good but book was better,"This movie has great scenary, I great story line, acting, etc. I preferred the book, which is usually the case with most adapted movies. I would recomend it to any WWII war buff. I would have liked to have seen a little less gore (yes of course gore is real in war but you can express it without being so blantant) Also, one minor complaint, I found myself saying after the first 30 mins, ""I get it, I get it, you are not a hero, I got it by the first 5 minutes, now can we move on and show more about the people that bravely fought for the island and how they won the island"" In short, I wanted to walk away from the movie feeling proud of the flag raising and all the marines, etc on Iwo instead of feeling ashamed to even look at the flag raising."
1,does not work,"The DVD came and does not work at all, in any of my DVD players!!! Very unhappy!! Did not send back because it would not be cost effective."
2,"Good War Action, Poor Movie Overall","Had high hopes for the movie after reading the book and since Eastwood was the directorAlas, the jerky editing, the simplistic messages hammered home in every frame of the movie marred what could have been an all-time classic. Even the war scenes, impressively framed, do not shed light on what was really going on - instead go for gore and shock. Eastwood should have spent more time on the war and less on the bond tour. He could have also done away with the flashbacks and used a simple linear narrative: training camp, war, bond tour and end on a high note."
3,Not as good as...,"Thinking this was done by Eastwood, I expected something along the lines of Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan. Sadly, I was disappointed. Though the story was good, I did not get totally wrapped up in it."
2,Revisionist Hooey,"This flick is just a bummer. If you're looking for ""Saving Private Ryan"" don't bother. There are no characters here to actually root for with the possible exception of Adam Beach. The battle scenes have no visceral impact. The film's worst sins are it's contention that the fighting men were not staking their lives for their country and that the homefront populace was sick and disengaged with the war effort. Doesn't director Clint Eastwood and scripter Paul Haggis realize that we were fighting an enemy that invaded our soil? I think the makers of this film are confusing the Second World War with subsequent U.S. military entanglements. News Flash!!! This was not Vietnam! It's also insulting to think that the civilian population of that time needed to be spoonfed propaganda to further the war effort. ""Where Eagles Dare"" and ""Kelly's Heroes"" have more credibility than this flick."
3,"Beautiful movie, but bare-bones DVD","Let me say I really did enjoy the movie quite a bit (was expecting more battle scenes and to be a bit more linear, but whatever), I've just got to warn people about purchasing this DVD. It might be better to wait.There isn't ANY special features at all! This is probably because the studio is planning on a big deluxe package sometime later this year. If so, I will then have a pretty useless DVD which I will need to trade in.Smart shoppers out there, do what I didn't do. Wait for it. This movie deserves some good special features.And if the Letters From Iwo Jima DVD is going to be just as bare-bones as this, I'm really going to be upset. That's my favorite WWII movie right there."
1,hamfisted directing,"Honestly, was this such a controversy over who exactly raised the flag on Iwo Jima that it warranted a feature film. The battle scenes are terrific but the whole angst over the three soldiers who are held up as heroes lost me. I just felt the movie was much ado about nothing. Worthy of maybe an hour documentary or investigative report on ""60 Minutes"" but not an entire movie.I also spent half the movie going: ""Oh, look, it's the crazy murderous husband from 'Desperate Housewives.' There's the guy from 'Mad Men' and the crazy neighbor chick from 'Two And a Half Men.' "" Very distracting to put such TV stars in the bit roles.I'd sooner have seen a straight war movie on the Iwo Jima invasion.I sure hope ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" is a lot better."
2,Where's the rest of the movie?,"It seems ironic to me that while this film was heavily touted, its sister-film, ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" has been nominated for an Oscar, yet we've heard relatively little of it being promoted, except for the ""now playing"" blip on television. As a former Marine, I honor the sacrifice of my fellow Brothers, but I have to ask myself, why isn't the other side being told? Why aren't theaters just as anxious to show that all sides in war know honor and death equally?Makes me wonder if the same thing is going on in Iraq. We have many brave boys dying, but what about the other side? They should be honored as well. Maybe we'll have to wait 60 years before we hear of their side of the story from an America that's blinded by its ""patriotism"" and paying for it with its dearest blood."
1,Flag of our Fathers,Very poor - the dvd did not function at all on several players - I sent it back and never received anything or a refund.
1,Fags of Our Eastwood,"The battle scenes were great, but too short, the rest of the movie is like a soap opera about 3 soldiers going on a fund raising tour w/ a drunken indian. The story jumped back and forth too much for me."
2,Wasn't that great.,The movie had a few touching moments and a few good action/war scenes but overall it was not that good. The story line was a bit weak and felt forced. It defintly does not hold up next to some of the great movies like Saving Private Ryan. I even think Pearl Harbor was better then this movie.
2,A 2 star reviw from Kill the Sky,"My favorie actor is Clint Eastwood. My favorite theme is World War 2 movies. This movie however just does not speak to me. The movie is slow and while it paints a picture of realism sometimes the viewer needs a bit of the far fetched. I found myself longing for for the very good fight scenes and sitting waiding through all the other garbage surrounding th flag berrors.Now the the second movie letters from Iwo Gima - the Second movie in this 2 movie set, I give 5 star review. It is truly an amazing human struggle story. Clint really pulled that movie off well. You be the judge, I own this movie and have only wathed it 2 times. I own Letters, and still watch it time to time"
3,Falls a little short,"A big ambitious film, this one tries very hard but ultimately falls short of being the majestic look at the meaning of it all that Clint strove for. The story behind the Iwo Jima flag raising is an intriguing one and this film lays it bare, though the structure of flashbacks may not help. Is it about the misplaced idoltry, the meaning of war, the Greatest Generation, the stories of the soldiers involved? Yes, yes yes etc. It just doesn't quite achieve those goals. Still, it's a valiant effort, well worth watching as Clint keeps cranking out the best work of his career."
1,Constant flashbacks make it difficult to follow and to be engaged with the movie,"Constant flashbacks make it difficult to follow and to be engaged with the movie. It also drags in many places. As a result I did not feel sympathetic, connected, and emotional for the characters. I did not enjoy it. The book is much more touching and enjoyable.Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, the Longest Day, the Lost Battalion, Gettysburg and Gods and Generals are still the only titles on my list of Best War Movies of All Times."
2,Slow and boring,"I am interested in this story, and the experiences that these men went through. But this movie did a terrible job of making it interesting. There were very few things to keep me interested and vested in the characters. Letters Of Iwo Jima was so much better. Watch that instead."
3,Flags is Ok,"It's good movie, based on a true story. Flashbacks within flashbacks is an interesting technique used by Eastwood. The acting is good, not really powerful."
2,dissapointed in film,"After watching ""letters from Iwo Jima"" I expected this movie to be the American version of the battle at Iwo Jima. I expected the movie to tell the story to be told in chronological order of the battle followed by the story of the bond drive made possible by the famous photo of the flag raising. After about 25 minutes Eastwood stopped telling about the battle & started telling about the bond drive by 3 men who raised the flag. After this the battle scenes were basically flashbacks about how the men who raised the flag were killed at Iwo. If I didn't know the history before watching this movie I would not have known who won the battle after watching this movie.Pete"
2,Read the Book - Skip the Movie,"Director Clint Eastwood's adaptation of James Bradley's ""Flags of Our Fathers"" makes the fatal error of jettisoning the book's linear structure. This ambitious Iwo Jima saga goes all over the map with its excessive flashbacks and cross-cutting distractions, thus keeping the audience at arm's length. Ryan Phillippe, Adam Beach and Barry Pepper try to rise above the narrative quagmire, but it's a losing battle. The film's artistic failure can be attributed to Eastwood's astonishing lack of focus - he never seems fully engaged in the source material. By striking contrast, the more-intimate ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" is better aligned with his directorial skill."
4,"Great film, poignant, moving filled, great take by Clint Eastwood","This movie was phenomenal. Wonderful characters, amazing cinematography. Brilliant. Job Well done by young talented actors, another directoral masterpiece by Clint Easthood. Highly recommend this film."
2,needs a history vs. hollywood segment,"the historical inaccuracies in this movie are ludicrous. we were not going broke fighting ww2. our navy and marine commanders were by and large thoughtful and caring men. the treasury department people in charge of the war bonds were nothing like those portrayed in the movie. the battle scenes shown are designed to horrify, not truly tell the story of what happened on iwo jima. there were a lot of heroes at iwo jima, not all dead on the field of battle. this movie seems to have been written by someone who wants to strip all nobility from warriors, and to denigrate any american authority figure from that time period. a lot of time and care went into this movie, unfortunately, in the service of anti-american propaganda. what in the world has happened to clint?"
2,1.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A failure on almost every level, Flags of Our Fathers is a slow, poorly-acted, stiffly-directed and leaden drama/war-film that hammers the viewer over the head with its ""message"" at every opportunity and *actually* ends with a tearful deathbed scene in which a son reconnects with his father; please watch the far superior Letters From Iwo Jima (or basically anything else) before you watch this overwraught corn."
1,Could have been a great movie but.......,"It is sad when you watch a movie like this and you cannot wait till the movie is over. It seems like movies now want to be negative and for sure not patriotic at all. These men were brave and hero's just like all fighting men are that are fighting for freedom and security of this country. But you walk away from this movie not feeling that way at all. And also if you noticed no reference to god and we know especially in 1942,soldier's were praying and reading the bible for sure on a average. Again it is a shame that so many movies now have great potential to be great but are lacking so much and fall short of being what those old movies had. Where is people like John Wayne, James Stewart, Clark Gable, etc....."
1,ZZZZZZZ,Too bad such a great historic moment was trivalized. Choppy. Too long. No substance. Phony. Suggest Clint return to being a mayor. His acting & directing days are over.
2,Pretty boring,I think it is almost a remake of an old movie about an Indian that was one of the soldiers at the flag raising.The story is terrible it is about the soldiers who raised the flag at Iwo Jima. Then tells how they were used as propaganda by the United States government to lift the morale of the American people and raise money for the war effort. It then allegedly shows the effect on the war on the veterans.The filming is good but hardly brilliant. The acting so poor that I don't think anyone performance is worth mentioning.
4,Iwo Jima,"Having read the book 2 times I was able to keep track of the names better than someone who had not read it. I had no expectations, consequently everything was great. Showed more war going on than expected, but I suppose that has to be considered."
5,Great Personalities,"I am reminded, in this case of the Ira Hayes character, played by one of the most ernest and sincere actors I've seen in years, Adam Beach, that even though a tough, unified Corp is made into team...it is really the individual that comes forth.I congratulate Mr. Eastwood, who has rounded into a solid and ambitious Director. I also look forward to the sequel, Letters From Iwo Jima and wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer (in this group) who suggested all films should show both sides.Perhaps then we can come to understand that when it's all said and done, the politician takes over what they started...and the men who were uprooted and displaced do indeed have to fight endless inner demons.This is an achievement I see here. I would favor more films like this. Naturally I know (given the time frame) that all stories cannot be told but some portions can...and it is then up to us, to take it beyond that.Well done and recommended."
2,Iwo Jima,"I felt it lack any meaning to the solder's lives, which the book covered so well. With the exception of Ira Hayes the others were left out.the book was outstanding. Only Ira Hayes life was followed, the others had lives also, but I failed to really see them as real people."
2,it ok but disc skips a little,i just got it and i was playing it and it skipped and screen got cube like at 24 minutes and ten seconds also the cover is cheap flimsy plastic. i know from is always flimsy but were DVD goes plastic is flimsy. i reccomended but be warned DVD case is flimsy and dvd may skip a couple times. and a great education movie. itr best movie ever put into heart of the action
2,Flags of Our Fathers,"I bought this movie for a friend, but he and I watched it together, totally immersed in the vivid scenes of the horrors of war. The acting was superb. The cover-up not a surprise knowing how politics these days works. I strongly recommend seeing this film and hopefully seeing it will help us all to honor the dead who willingly gave their lives for their country. It's riveting - and the young man who played the ""Chief"" was superior."
1,"An important subject, but lousy movie","1. Yes, I'm comparing this movie to the book, but it's a natural thing to do... because this movie is based on the book.2. With the above obvious fact being duly noted, this movie just doesn't do justice to the book. Perhaps it's impossible for a movie to match a book; if that's the case--> then just don't even try to make a movie.3. Bottomline: just please read the book."
3,Great film - wait for the combo with letters from Iwo Jima,"This was a great film. I saw it in the theater. However, the DVD edition is a short changer (why I gave it 3 stars). For certain, within 6 months there will be a box set out with this film and the companion piece ""Letters from Iwo Jima"". Save the money and purchase it then. I predict that package will also have plenty of extras. Don't fall for the old marketing trick of forcing you to purchase a film 3 or 4 times."
4,Blu Ray Flags of our Fathers - Clint Eastwood as an amazing director,"I have been a fan of Mr. Eastwood for a long time. He, as an actor, I think is amazingly talented and can play a diverse set of roles. He is very comfortable in front of the camera.With this movie he made me understand that he is just as comfortable behind the camera. I was shocked and amazed at his talent for telling the story and I believe telling it right. If you haven't seen this even though its about 4 years old now I think you'll be as taken by this film as I was. I only gave it four stars and I don't like to just dish out five star ratings. There were a few bits I felt could have been better from a technical standpoint of film making but from the story telling side. VERY good.[...]"
4,Flags of our fathers,"The movie helped personalize the fight of the generation that went before me. My father was a career man in the army and fought in WWII and the Korean War. Clint Eastwood did a wonderful thing by making this movie and the companion film, Letters from Iwo Jima. Both entertaining, informative, and insightful."
4,A Thought Provoking Film,"""Flags of Our Fathers' is a thought provoking historical film. It consists of two basic segments, scenes of the battle for Iwo Jima and the story of the War Bond Tour on which the survivors were sent.The battle scenes are excellent. They skillfully depict the horrors which must be war. The Bond Tour segments tell a different story about how the ""heroes"" were treated by others and how they viewed themselves.This movie is thought provoking in that it makes the viewer consider the nature and happenstance of ""heroism"" and its fleeting nature. The heroes did not consider themselves to be heroic and their post war lives were determined by their post-war actions, not their status as ""heroes."" In a sense, all on Iwo Jima were the heroes and a few were sent on tour. A movie that leaves one thinking is a worthwhile watch."
5,War Up Close and Personal,"Flags Of Our Fathers DVDFlags Of Our Fathers directed by Clint Eastwood and produced by Clint Eastwood is based on true events surrounding the Battle for Iwo Jima during World War II. It follows the activities of two marines and one sailor who supposedly helped raise the U.S. Flag on a hill on Iwo Jima, a picture of which was shown in just about every newspaper in America. A signal of success after one of the bloodiest battles in the Pacific campaign. The ""Powers that be"" eventually turn the picture into a publicity stunt to raise money for the war.Warning, contains some blood and guts. Not recommended for young children. It is recommended for those who want to see what war is like up close and personal.Gunner December, 2007"
3,Not the success it should have been...,"I read the book twice in recent years, so I was much better prepared for the movie than most in the audience. I think familiarity with the book is essential in this case. Eastwood tries to tell too much, I think, and the flashbacks get annoying eventually. While Adam Beach as Ira Hayes was fine, there could have been two films here: the heroic struggle for that damn island, and a sequel about the exploitation of the surviving flag-raisers. Two separate 90-minute movies, along with the third part of the trilogy, ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", giving the Japanese point of view, would have worked better. Still, this battle was ferocious and deserves to be honored for more than the 15-seconds of flag-raising on the fifth day of a 36-day fight. Read the book first, then see the DVD, if you are interested at all in the next-to-last great battle of the Pacific War."
3,Flags of Our Fathers : Falls Short,"I really wanted to love this movie. I love Clint Eastwood, and I love movies based on fact. Don't get me wrong, it is a good movie, and I did enjoy it, if only on a superficial scale. But maybe I was expecting something more, I wanted it to warm my heart, then tear it apart and eventually heal it again, but I didn't get that. The main characters just didn't engross me. I felt wanting more in the end. I still love Mr Eastwood and I'm looking forward to Letters from Iwo Jima."
2,No Extras,"I love WWII movies and was looking forward to Flags of our Fathers on DVD. I was especially hoping it would include commentaries by a war historian and veterans of the battle. The DVD came out today, but I did not buy it. I didn't see one tiny extra listed on the back. Since the DVD is so plain, there has to be a ""Director's Cut"" or ""Special Edition"" coming out in the near future. Like an earlier reviewer put it, I am tired of buying a disc only to have a more extensive copy come out a little later. I didn't see the movie in the theater, but I will be patient for a change and wait for the more extensive version that is sure to come.Like I said, I have not seen the movie, therefore, the 2 stars are only for the bare bones disc.pk"
3,Didn't know what it wanted to be when it grew up,"Was the film supposed to be a war movie in the ""war is hell"" mold, a biting social statement on wartime and post-war ethnic prejudice, a cynical commentary on the policy of funding war and maintaining popular enthusiasm for war, or a multi-stranded biopic? Like Rodenberry's constantly-transforming Martian, it tries to be everything, and therefore succeeds at nothing."
3,Read the book then see the movie,"As a retired Marine who served in combat in Viet Nam and have read about Iwo Jima since the day I joined the Corps, I must say I was disappointed in the movie - especially since the book was so well done. The combat scenes are quite impressive a' la Saving Private Ryan, but as the story unfolds it is difficult to follow the characters and understand exactly who was where and who did what. The acting is good but not great. Not Clint Eastwood's best effort. If you liked the book you will enjoy the movie, but not as much."
2,"I don't know if I'd call it ""essential.""","Granted, this is a book on human resources, a naturally mundane subject, but my GOD! It is so much more boring than I could have ever anticipated. I'm only a few chapters in, but the thought of returning to this text week after week, throughout the semester, kind of makes me want to shove bamboo splinters under my fingernails. There aren't a lot of textbooks out there on HR for nonprofits and public service orgs though, so...thanks?"
2,Reformatting needed on Kindle Edition,"The kindle version has everything the paper version does. Unfortunately, there is a significant number of formatting issues that take away from the content of the book. Anyone purchasing the kindle version should be aware that page numbers are not included. This makes creating proper citations difficult and otherwise referencing the materials a challenge. There are also many issues with multiple words running together in the kindle edition, meaning that all of the words in a sentence will be pushed together as if the sentence were one word. Overall the book is informative and an excellent learning tool, but save your money for the paper version as the kindle edition is less than hassle free to read."
3,Easy Read,"I bought this used but it showed up in brand new condition, which may say something for the book. It's extremely easy to read and offers good information about HR but is fairly elementary. It reads like a high school text book; that can be a good or a bad thing depending on the student."
2,An Instructor's Viewpoint,"Human Resources Management for Public and Nonprofit Organizations: A Strategic Approach (Jossey Bass Nonprofit & Public Management Series)This book has the essentials, but for the price is not worth the money for my students. There are absolutely no instructor or student supplemental materials with this book other than a file that's called an instructors manual that is a digital copy of Joan Pynes' syllabus. This textbook was the wrong choice to engage undergraduate students."
3,Rough Sailing,"In addition to the Patrick O'Brian series, I have read several of the Heary-of-Oak series nautical fiction novels and all have been excellent. This one, however, falls short and the nautical fiction fan may grow weary of Cooper's long winded laborious style of writing. I have to admit, I couldn't get through the entire book but admit the author to be a talented writer. Nevertheless, I think the purist nautical fiction fan may prefer a less pretentious style of writing a la Forester, Marrayat, James Nelson or Richard Woodman."
3,Good but.......,"This is a great collection of music from the folks in South Carolina, home of Carolina Beach Music. The box set is worth every penny you pay but all the songs that the package listing shows are not on the discs. It also should be noted that many of these recordings are needle drops and have a lot of compression added. If you're a beach music fan you're sure to like, but if you are thinking that everything is as listed, it's not."
5,Worn out disc #1,This set is incredible. We have worn out disc#1. Some great shaggin music. Missing an all time favorite - Under the Boardwalk!
3,"Great tunes, poor audio quality","This box set simply does not come close to the quality we expect of oldies on CDs nowadays. Especially because reissues that are remastered with care, from original master tapes, can sound so great. In terms of audio quality, then, this box set is out of date. It is mediocre sound quality at best. I work as a mobile DJ and when I play a track from this box over my professional sound system, there is a noticeable drop-off in quality compared to the vast majority of my other ""oldies"" CDs!!! If you're just listening to it through a ""boom box"" or other cheap stereo system, however, you might not notice as much of a difference."
2,Big Head Todd Avalon in Boston,"The music is fine, they played really well at this show. But the sound quality sucks and this set is massively overpriced because of the crap sound quality."
3,Major omission!,"This recording is missing ""And the Glory of the Lord"" !! How can that be? I agree with the others that ""For Unto Us a Child is Born"" is fast, but it certainly doesn't sound like the Chipmunks. It's been performed fast by others in the past. Conductor's discretion.Best part for me? Robert Hale on tracks #19 and #20. I knew him when I was a little girl -- my mother would accompany him.......long time ago but the strength in his voice still stirs something inside me. These tracks alone make the CD worth it for me."
2,you get what you pay for,"I was misled into believing that the rudder control was a twist on the yoke, like the more top end joysticks, instead it's a dial on the front of the joystick, which I don't like. I end up using auto rudder on the my flight games, instead of coordinating my own flight."
3,Lauridsen,Morten Lauridsen is beautifully unique and deserves the very best. I don't think this group was. I was expecting more.
3,"Not impressed with music but singing is excellent,","I came across Lauridsen on the Hyperion compilation ""Dreamland"" but was not sure about him - I thought the tune on the compilation (Ave Dulcissima Maria)was emotionally manipulative. Anyway I decided to give him a try and with naxos there is hardly much of a financial risk! However, this music did very little for - I have listened to it three times and come away with no real impression."
5,Great Product,I already had one before and got this one for one of my family members. the only flaw is that pictures taken inside rooms are not that of high quality as compared to the pictures taken outside.otherwise a great product.
2,2 months of gentle use and now it has a snag,"I bought a new piece on amazon and used it for not more than 2 months and it doesn't work anymore. I haven't droped it or mis used it or anything. One day I was clicking as usual and instead of taking the picture, when i click it zooms in and stays like that. I called up Panasonic, and they had me send the camera at my own shipping expense and re-soldered the parts (thats what they told me they did) and sent it back after 20 days or so. Please make a better choice.. Don't buy this camera."
3,Convenient and fast but nothing spectacular,"For the price, this camera is pretty good value for the money. Then again, after having used it for about two weeks and having shot under various circumstances, from bright sunlight to low light, I am not impressed. In fact, I used a Canon S230 Powershot before. I am happy that the Panasonic is so much faster and responsive. But that's to be expected. Other than that, I find no remarkably different picture quality. And the lens is virtually the same."
1,Poor customer service - item broken,The clock didn't work and I haven't heard anything back. It has been over a month. It was supposed to be a gift and I am very disappointed.
3,Smaller then what I thought,We had an older cat clock and I thought I was ordering the same one. This clock is almost miniature in size compared with my previous one. Not a huge deal as shipping was very fast from the seller.
4,Everything old is new again,"A devotee of 60's pop, edward roger's debut album is a guided tour of a distant New York through the eyes of a London transplant. rogers, known to hip New Yorkers as the curator of the Beat Goes On series of shows at the ironically shuttered Bottom Line, is both muscial archivist and smart mimic. The list of guests here is a who's who of baroque pop: Colin Blunstone and Rod Argent from the Zombies; Marty Wilson-Piper from the Church--to name a few. Cellist extraordinaire Jane Scarpantoni's tasteful and tuneful strings always add, rather than overshadow the songs. Producer Josh Tyler has extracted fine performances from rogers and partner George Usher. I wish there was more breathing room in their vocals, but knowing the passion and single-minded drive that went into this album, I'm willing to forgive slights simply because as a labor of love, this record shines. Catchy, driving, gentle and lush. Tune in and enjoy."
5,An enjoyable read,"This is a very old book, I remember reading when I was perhaps 18? Seemed much racier back then, in 1973, pretty tame now by todays standards. Entertaining story and I enjoyed reading it again after all these years."
1,What A Waste of Dough,"This album was pretty stinky. I must sadly admit it is one of the worst CDs I own. Buffalo Daughter can't sing for their lives,and although this was at times charming, it proved to be too weak to earn this album any significant starring."
4,Designer Drone Quaalude Post-Rock?,"Having purchased this on a whim, I must say that I do find it a refreshing soundtrack to keep in the background while I engage in a variety of household activities. That said, I think this is the point of Post-Rock: Keep it minimal, interesting and explore only so much foreground. I would argue that this latest offering from Buffalo Daughter will seem much like Martin Denny-esqe exotica from the 50's in 20 yrs or so: information-age (Bachelor/ette) music to whir and hum to the veneer that covers our bland, design-driven existence."
5,still good a year later,"i've been listening to this record for a while now and unlike a lot of the crap i bought last year this is still excellent. if you have a chance to catch them live, don't miss it."
2,Could have been much better,I wasn't nearly as wowed by this book as others were. The book really didn't pick up until the last seventy pages or so.
1,This might be the worst book I've ever read.,"I didn't have a problem with this book for about the first half. The plot was alright, despite being utterly and completely predictable. Then came the terrible ending. If you don't like spoilers, don't read any further.SPOILERS BELOW!!Okay, so the whole raising of the Titanic is worthless. Why couldn't they have just found the freaking byzanium in the vault? Would have wrapped up the story nicely and not been the worse ending I've ever read. The whole ending was based on a minute, chance comment made to Pitt, that no one even remembers reading. Also there's the whole ""Dana's a whore so we're going to have her have sex"" scene. Okay, obviuosly Cussler isn't getting any and just wanted to write it in. Otherwise, it was pointless and really random.To all the English teachers out there, please don't make the mistake of my teacher and assign this book. It's horrible and your students will hate you all the more for it."
3,Titanic risen!,"His later books are much better written, and of course, at the time of writing, they did not know that the Titanic had broken up on sinking."
4,great job...by the master......Clive Cussler,"Considering the book is written long before the Titanic was discovered, this is a fascinating book. i agree with one of the review that the Titanic is impossible to raise, since it's seaperated in two parts and the idea of running the derelict boat through a hurricane is certainly a bit inconceivable, which is why i gave it 4 stars instaed of 5. Anyway, Mr.Cussler did a real nice job in wrapping it up - answering all the question at the begining of the book and tied up all the loose ends. It's just a masterpiece."
3,Best known sea tragedy gets the Dirk Pitt treatment.,"The problem with combining the Titanic and Dirk Pitt, is that the event is to well known. Cussler's most successful books have dealt with those legendary or mythical events which can be elaborated with out every historian crying ""foul""The fact that a movie was made of this novel gives creedance to the subject matters mass appeal. It remains however, the most unfulfilling of the Dirk Pitt adventures in reference to pure escapism."
1,Worst thing I have EVER read.,"Completely unbelievable plot. Total lack of understanding of anything remotely connected with science. Abysmal characterisation, junior-school dialogue, this book almost completely drained me of the will to live. I regret deeply the afternoon I wasted reading this turgid excuse for a novel, as I will never be able to reclaim it. Little wonder the movie based on it sank without trace, how could anyone have been stupid enough to have thought that this noisesome mess was worth more than the effort of pulping all exsisting copies. I had to give this one star to get my review submitted, the form requires that field is filled, but I would really like to give it a massive negative rating."
4,"Raise the Titanic, fast paced page turner, that compels the reader to keep reading.","Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt adventure's have captivated me from the first book I have read. As with all of the other Dirk Pitt adventure's, Raise the Titanic,did not disappoint. I will say however, that there were parts of the story, that seemed to drag on. I will not go into specifics, so I do not spoil anything for future readers. I highly recommend this book, as well as all other, of the Dirk Pitt adventure series."
5,Rasie The Titanic,"Well what can one say. This book was great from start to finsih, all though must have been written before the finding of the Titanic truely an amazing story would read again at some stage highly recommended."
4,Action packed!,"This book was written before they found Titanic. That didn't take anything out of the story though. It was action packed, and had a great twist ending. This is my first Cussler book and I feel that I will read more adventures of Dirk Pitt!"
5,Raise The Titantic,"The novel ""Raise the Titantic!"" is the most intriguing and exciting book of the year! It has got to be the best book by clive cussler to date. The star of the story, Dirk Pitt, is under the sea once again searching for the famed Titantic. Clive Cussler, the author of ""Saharah"" and ""Deep Six"" send's our hero Dirk Pitt in a race against time and other countries to salvage the giant ship with a secret cargo that could prove to be the key ellement to the defense of the United States! No one can do it like Clive Cussler, no one!"
3,Good if read during the Cold War.,For the most part not much really happens. It was written in the 70's when people were still terrified about Communism. I could of seen this book a good read if I was older and actually lived during those times but since I didn't I found it hard to connect with the book. This is the 16th Clive Cussler book I have read and still think he is a great author and find it interesting to read how much Dirk Pitt has changed. In the more recent books (mid 80s and on) Pitt has more of a solid typical hero vibe. In the older books he is more arrogant and kind of a jerk. Just interesting to see the character development there.
4,"Wonderful writting, wonderful suspence, a great book.","I should have put down four and a half stars, cause it's that good. Someone wrote down about how the facts about the Titanic are way off. Yes, they are, but this book was written years more than TEN years before the Titanic was found and studied. He was writting what he thought the Titanic would look like after 76 years under water, and he did a fine job in discribing what the hull looks like after all thouse years. Plus, it is a work of FICTION, ok, as in ""Not real"". Being that it is fiction, it is a fine one at that. The suspense keeps you turning pages wanting to find answers, and the characters are believeable. The downfall of Gene Seagram was very well done. Imagine if all you lived for, all you worked for, what you put all your money on, was found to be worth nothing, disspossed in less that a day. I would probably break down. It is a great book, a very enjoyable book, and one that keeps it's head-on pace right to the very end."
2,A Boring book By a GREAT WRITER,"This book starts off good, but gets worse and worse! The title lead me to believe it was about the Titanic and I mean hardly! But Cussler is a good writer and many of his books are great. This book just wasn't interesting."
3,Not Getz's very best,"It is very clear from the first three tracks that these recordings are not Stan Getz, the master tenor sax, best. He deserves better. Although, there are a number of compilations on his career that are noteworthy, none of them hold their weight to his albums. These selections are adequate, but so much is missing from his bossa nova days, and this selection tends to emphasize his other works on standards.Many of these songs seem choppy, and too free-flowing, but there is a lot to be said about his passion to improvise, like""my funny valentine"". I was rather surprised by ""blood count"", and it's soft almost structured texture. But I was disappointed in how many times the piano players, and guitarists, overshadowed Getz' sound.If you are interested in the real Stan Getz, and you want a great compilation, try Verve Jazzmasters 8:Stan Getz, or Verve Jazz Round Midnight."
5,FRESH SCENT OF RAIN in a bottle,"This is great stuff, smelling clean and fresh, heavenly. I find myself wanting to use it as air freshner. It is a light fragrance, not overpowering. If you've ever used Rain fragrances before, this one is the best in my opinion. I use the body lotion also, which is light, and feels great on the skin, not greasy or heavy at all, and leaves the same, fresh fragrance. For those of you who don't particularly like heavy smelling perfumes, this is a nice alternative. eBubbles shipped mine promptly and packed it in lovely turquoise tissue. The bottle comes in a lovely round box (see the picture) that would be perfect when giving as a gift. I am very pleased, and will order it again, and again."
5,Perfect Summer Fragrance,"Rain by Terra Nova is the perfect summer fragrance, it is light and clean. I have purchased from this vendor in the past because they carry Rain which is really not an easy product to find. Shipment was prompt and an added little sample packet was a bonus. Thank You ~~~"
3,"Doesn't rock, okay for Barney fans","My big objection is that the voice of BJ is too shrill on this CD, to the point of being painful during the more Rock n Roll section. Some of the songs are pretty good Barney songs; I prefer the second half with more traditional Barney songs, especially some of my daughter's favorites like ""Squishy, squashy Washy"" - a song we always have to stop and dance for."
2,Rocks?,"This CD does not rock. It is filled with soft, kiddy ballads that CANNOT, in any way, be called rock. BJ's voice is horribly shrill, and Barney's ""Oom-Day-Day-Doo"" is annoying on the song Rock N Roll Star. Not a rock album at all."
5,Most thrilling version,"Like your first and only other reviewer, I heard the Waltz Sequence (don't know if it was #1 or #2) on the radio, unaware of who was playing. I paid close attention at the end to find out, and was very surprised. I come from Bavaria, and Strauss' music is in my blood. I can truly say that this single audition impressed me as the most thrilling of ALL I've heard. Generally, this kind of music is mastered only by natives but it looks like these Americans ""got it."" BRAVO! I'll buy the record with my next order (I have not heard the other selections, but the waltzes suffice)."
1,DO NOT BUY,Here is how you can save a ton of money:1. Do not buy this Ink.2. Throw away your Sharp fax or printer (actually smash it so no other poor sole finds it and gets into the same trap).3. Buy something else that does not need $34 ink for every 50 pages you print.I have used this ink catridge and I am really-really disappointed.
2,Good Cartridge-Can't refill,"The cartridge is ok, but it was built so that it cannot be refilled. Maybe you should stay away from products that use this type cartridge if refilling cartidges and saving money is your thing. I paid $49.00 for the fax machine it goes in and the cartridge is $35.00 + or -."
3,It's an Ink Cartridge. What Else Is There To Say?,I bought this ink cartridge. It works. They run out too fast and cost too much.Anything else you need to know?
1,UX-B750 Sharp Fax,"I thought this was to good to be true and I learned the hard way. Now if I want to know what a SUCKER looks like? Anyone who is stupid enough to buy this junk. Sharp, you got me once but rest assured you won't get me again. I will not buy any sharp product again."
1,cynical marketing strategy,"i agree with virtually every review posted here. They sell the fax very cheap, then charge almost the same full price for an ink cartridge. Trouble is, the cartridge is used up in no time at all. Is their ink really so poorly formulated that it evaporates, or do they use a stingy amount of ink in the cartridge? Very, very expensive cartridge at that. Maybe Sharp thinks they're marketing-crafty. To me, it means I won't be loyal to theSharp brand ever again."
1,Nothing but Trouble,I purchased this cartridge for my Sharp Broadband Fax and have called tech support twice just to get it work. Turns out it is defective and theyy wil be shipping me a new one.
3,Reliable but expensive,"Expensive cartridge but does its job. Not able to find anything but OEM so something to consider if you run across one of these older fax machines, even if you're given one for free, you have to spend a lot on this cartridge if you print faxes. I only use for sending and occasional printing so not a big deal."
5,What can I say,It's an ink cartridge for a fax machine. It did outlast the fax machine so I'd say that it was worth the cost.
3,Could be better,"This is a heavy-duty cord, but after several months of use the yellow outer insulation is beginning to slip away from the plugs exposing a fibrous inner material. The cord has not been pulled by the plug, so I am at a loss as to why this is happening."
5,this is the best little book I've seen in quite a while,"This is an excellent book for kids (and adults, too). Too bad it is so hard to get in the US."
3,Okay...,These are okay shorts. I like them. The underwear inside of them are uncomfortable so I'd recommend cutting them out. They do have a convienent side slot for a key or ipod.
3,"A great collection, BUT . . .","This is a great collection but the tracks listed here on the website are slightly different than the ones actually on the CD. I had the ""original"" which did have these exact tracks but lost it. I have been searching for the ""original"" but have not been able to find it. I ordered this one but ended up returning it because it was missing some of the key songs I wanted. Beware."
4,this is the one !,This is Budgie at their best.With this album they changed directions and entered the world of British metal. The result: a milestone ! Every song is a must and that also goes for the four bonus-tracks on the cd. Sadly enough they never reached the same level again on any other album ...
1,POOP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS CD IS GARBAGE MF DOOM'S BEATS DOESN'T MATCH WITH MF GRIMM'S LYRICS THIS THE WORST MF DOOM CD IV'E EVER HEARD COSIDERING THAT ALL HIS CD'S I EVER HEARD ARE THE DOPEST SH?T EVER. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR DONT COP THIS CRAP
3,"easy to use, fair performance","The best part about this transmitter is that it works with so many different ipods, you don't have to worry about which generation you have. It's also super easy to use, although you wouldn't want to be driving if you need to change the channel. Of course it works best outside of urban areas, where radio signals aren't as strong; great for road trips."
1,THE SOUND IS VERY BAD,I don't like the quality sound of this FM transmitter for my ipod!!!I won't recomend it
3,better than others,This was the second FM transmitter I purchased since the previous one of a different brand did not work well at all. This Belkin did not work well on my Mother's car stereo and was about to return it until I tried it on my car stereo. It worked great on mine. I drove a 20 mile distance with clarity and without having to change the FM station once. I am thinking it depends on the stereo and location and not so much this product that may cause problems. I'm satisfied.
1,Faulty,"This product didn't work at all, i'm currently seeking monetary compensation in exchange for the return of my product."
4,metal edge,"There is an increase of attitude and volume on this one, the galloping charge of the title track is insane. The power crunch keeps up but the material takes a dip and gets a little blusey and unoriginal. But the jams are pretty good. Also second ""temporary"" drummer Pete Boot is slamming away on the drums with loud production keepin the intensity level up. A good follow up to ""Never Turn Your Back..."" but it really lacks in the song department. It had the metal edge needed for the upcomin' N.W.O.B.H.M. that was around the corner. A unique one in their catalog. Not like the three before it or the three after it"
5,It pounds like a hammer.,"If there was ever a Budgie Album that needed to be listened to; this is it. The title track was once covered on stage by Van Halen during their early years of touring--before they made it big.But again, you've gotta listen to the original song and the original album. If you want Heavy Metal at it's bona-fide best, you can't beat this album. Turn the volume up, and destroy your ears. It's worth it."
5,Yet another gem from Budgie,"This is yet another ""complete"" album from Budgie. By this I mean every song is good. There is not one bomb in this collection. This re-release also includes alternate versions of three of these songs and a PC video. This is great music on a very underrated album from an extremely underrated and underpublicized band that blends beautiful ballads with blazing rockers. I highly recommend this and any of Budgie's works."
5,Secondary Victorian treasure pieces,"During her nearly sixty-four-year reign Queen Victoria produced a cultural and fashion following particularly notable in the jewelry world, where English and European Jewelers produced less expensive pieces mimicking the queen's, which were worn by the middle class of her times. These pieces were long ignored because of their low value and cheap materials - but today are prized for their workmanship, which VICTORIAN JEWELRY: UNEXPLORED TREASURES reveals in chapters of history following designs, materials, and lovely secondary pieces. Styles presented here have been selected from collections around the world and are displayed through specially commissioned color photos just for this book."
4,Interesting Book,"This book looks at the 'secondary' (lower priced) jewelry of the Victorian era. These are pieces made of non-precious metals & gemstones. The pictures are lovely, showing items made of silver, steel, jet, hair, & other items. There is some interesting information given - the only thing missing is some sort of price guide."
3,"I laughed, I cried, I put in a different movie.","This video was made by a bouncer with a camcorder in the back room of a strip club. That is my guess anyway. The fighting is much better than some of these chickfight videos, but none of the girls were in danger of getting a fat lip. Surprisingly, there are actually a couple good looking girls shown here. There is nudity, and there are even a couple good punches. If you can look past NO production value, and bad acting, you'll probably finish this thinking to yourself, man, that wasn't too disappointing. I know I did."
3,Warning: Not the Hit Single Version of Human Nature,"Question: Why would a label name a greatest hits album after the biggest (and pretty much only) hit an artist ever had, and then include a 12"" remix of that song instead of the original hit version?I don't know, but I have to admit, after searching for this song for many years, that I was one disappointed buyer when I discovered that was the case here.That said, the remix isn't bad, and if you're desperate to own this song (albeit in a different form), you may wish to purchase the album. Hey, it's a great song! But, on the other hand, if you wish to do your bit to stop obnoxious marketing practices such as this, I suggest you stay away until the hit version of Human Nature is re-released.The rest of the album is in a similar vein, although not up to the quality of the title track. However, I deducted one star from the rating on account of the selection of the alternate mix."
5,No Authority has a cool new sound,From their upbeat songs to their ballads No Authority's Keep On is a C.D you must have. No Authority should KEEP ON singing.
1,The Music Was Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!,"The love songs, if you'd call them that, were horrible, they sounded so simple and common. Couldn't this group have been more creative with they lyrics and tune? Oh, I'm sorry, they don't have control of what they do, they're just puppets in a band controlled by their manager."
1,YUCK!!!!,this cd is REALLY REALLY bad. What can you expect from a bunch of M.F.'S who think they're the new kids on the block who werent so great to begin with?
4,Not bad for a debut cd,"The 4 lads from So. Calif did a fairly good job on this one. It's a fairly good album, a little heavy on the R&B for my tastes, but I think that alot of people will be very happy with this one. The enhancements included on the cd will give you more information on the group"
1,Keep On,A nice debut by the band (No Authority) but it could have been better. tis on Michael Jackson's label..not that greeat at all. I feel bad since my friend got me this all the way from the phillipines. but i can't lie anymore haha
5,The only choice for commercial management and geospatial eng,"The Civil Engineering Surveyor is fantastic! It is the only trade journal in this industry that caters solely to the people who have to make the decisions that matter and is unafraid to speak the truth, no matter how many feathers are ruffled. What I didn't know was that the Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors is a registered educational charity, and all profits are ploughed back into the industry. The articles are impeccably researched and entertaining, and I find the advertising to be unobtrusive yet irresistably pervasive, which renders me unable to finish reading without picking up the phone!"
4,"fun, fun, fun!","I recently purchased this video thinking all the songs were from Disney's 'The Little Mermaid' but they only have two from 'The Little Mermaid' which includes 'Besala' {Kiss the Girl} and 'Bajo el Mar'{Under th Sea} so don't be fooled by the cover. The ten Disney songs featured in this video are: 'The Little Mermaid', 'Peter Pan', '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea', 'The Rescuers', and more. This video is fun and educational for kids or any one who is studying spanish. I now know some of the songs by heart in spanish with the help of this video. Now me and my Mexican friend can sing together. This will keep kids occupied for days while teaching them! Also you can check out other 'Canta Con Nosotros' videos featuring other popular Disney films."
5,Must have in any spanish library,The music is just what it originally is in english. There's follow along lyrics which makes it real easy for the parents (if they speak spanish) to follow. The songs do not change at all. This is truly a must have for anyone that is trying to learn the language.
2,Not much to learn from,I am a life coach and thought that this would be a source of additional information. I could not find on these DVDs any new information or any tool. These DVDs are really just a basic intro to psychology.
3,Only for beginners.,"This book gives a brief outline of the different cosmic models (steady state, Big Bang, the anthropic principle) and an explanation of the instruments and techniques used to explore the cosmos.It is a little bit out of date.I also missed the swinging style and the speculations of John Gribbin's 'In the Beginning' or Martin Rees' 'Before the Beginning'.For a more profound and up-to-date introduction to cosmology I recommend the more difficult book 'The elegant Universe' by Brian Greene."
2,Dissapointing...,"I read this book after finishing ""State Counselor"" (which I liked very much ) and was quite disappointed. It starts with a murder of an English Lord and his servants in Paris and a most inept and financially-broke French Police Officer is dispatched to the ship ""Leviathan"" to find the murderer. I don't why people say that it is a tribute to Agatha Christie for I found it similar to Wilkie Collin's Moonstone right from the narrative style to the plot. Fandorin is not in his element meaning that the author himself is not very easy with a non-Russian environment. After all the Author, apart from the last 20 years, had been living in an isolated vacuum of sorts - a hallmark of Soviet Russia. I think he (Akunin/Fandorin) had better not move out from Russia. We will try and learn to deal with those long Russian Names. I must say that his two Sister Pegalia novels were much better than his Fandorin series."
1,Beyond bad I have never stoped reading a book till this,I actually did not even read the whole book it was so bad I stoped reading it after 100 pages. The story is confusing and boring. There is no life to the charactors. Bad bad bad this book is just bad dont read it. I would give this 0 but you have to give it a 1.
4,"Third in the series, no sagging yet","Diverting entry in an ongoing series. Erast Fandorin is a charming, nineteenth-century Russian James Bond-if-he-was-fathered-by-Nero-Wolfe sleuth trapped on board a huge new luxury liner with a greedy, murderous genius who is after the world's greatest hoard of gemstones.People die right and left as the sleuth, ineptly assisted by seemingly every passenger assigned to eat in his dining room, closes in on the inevitable identification of the killer/fortune hunter. Much entertaining diversion available, though the novice to the series can pick this volume up and start right here with no fear of missing a step. Akunin is a master of the enriching aside, the grace note that adds a little something to the series' fans' pleasure, but isn't required for the newcomer to understand to get the full impact of the story or the characters.Genially recommended."
4,More fun with Fandorin,"Ten people murdered in the Paris household of an English lord, a hidden treasure to be found, a steamship full of suspects and ""Papa"" Gauche, France's top detective is on the case. And who is the strange Russian diplomat who is exceedingly competent and seems to know more than he should. Yes, Fandorin is on the case again.Yet again, Akunin has produced a fun detective story with a cast of diverse and interesting characters and several good twists. Based on this book, I have included the Turkish Gambit on my must buy list.I notice that some previous reviewers have classified this book as a ""Wanna-be Agatha Christie Tale"". My reaction is that it is not a ""Wanna-be Agatha Christie Tale"" rather it is a rather loving homage to Ms Christie, just as the first Fandorin story was a loving Homage to Ian Fleming."
3,"Good intro, but not enough details","I have a copy of this book. It covers popular credit risk models and things like RAROC, etc. These concepts have been discussed extensively in the industry but I assume this is the first in the book form. The book does a good job in presenting basic ideas. However, if you are looking for technical details, you best bets are still the original technical documentations (CreditMetrics, CreditRisk+, KMV, etc). Nevertheless this book is a useful survey of the current stable of models. Besides, it is not very expensive."
1,Don't waste your time,Working in the banking industry I was turned on to this book by a colleague and what a colossal waste of time reading this was. The vast majority of this book's models are outdated and if Mr. Saunders was trying to write a historical piece he has accomplished that in spades. Nothing in this book is relevant and it is obvious the esteemed Mr. Saunders lent his name to a very poor book that he probably should have glanced through if not read. Linda Allen should probably get some real world experience because she is wasting people's time with her research.
2,"Very abstract, very high level, very old","If you have to buy it for a class, get it. Otherwise, find something that was written more recently. Although the 2nd Edition shows a 2003 date, the vast majority of the text is obviously out of date and was written about 20 years ago. It has one chapter on object oriented design and it discusses it almost as if it were a passing fad. If there's a 3rd edition, let's hope it gets rewritten and doesn't just get a few references updated."
5,exceptionally fine singing by talented dramatic soprano,"The powerful singing of this artist is well-documented here. Exceptionally fine singing by a talented dramatic soprano. Cover artist, August 1998 Opera News, where it was asserted Marc is one of only four dramatic sopranos on the scene today (the others being Voight, Eaglen and Sweet). Very impressive in performance with Dallas Symphony Orch. & Chorus autumn 1998 (recorded for future release on Dorian). The recording itself is a little bright in an overly-reverberant accoustic. However, this defect detracts little from the whole. Give this one a listen, she deserves to be heard."
5,Best soprano around and a beautiful collection of arias,"This is one of my favorite CDs by my favorite soprano, Alessandra Marc. Believe me, if you want to hear a lush and powerful voice, Ms. Marc is the lady you need to be listening to. This is a great collection of popular arias that are sung beautifully here all on one disc. Also, her artistry is astonishingly meticulous."
4,The original Ricky,"The original Ricky Ricardo - cuban style - lots of mambo and rhumba.Another time and era that affected the US music market, but we never really knew where it came from.This is the real thing."
5,Break Through to the Other Side,"I long suspected a hidden treasure, a list of books closely guarded by academia. This is the list. What a joy, delight. Inspiring. Like finding a private library. Just, don't tell Oprah. Something For Everyone, might be a suitable subtitle, for the list within could launch several genres of works. This is a thin antidote for writer's block and tepid literary challenges of your local lit club for sure. Overlooked gems."
5,Volume 2,"I have at the moment two box sets and they're both excellent. A revelation! The colour is faultless and is certainly the best enhanced patented process I have ever seen. All in keeping with the wonderful Shirley, her storylines and cast. What a blessing. I encourage anyone with a brain to buy any Shirley items, and look forward to buying more"
2,Terrible quality,"The 3 movies were such bad quality, they were difficult to watch. Bright Eyes was so bad the entire film ""jiggled"". They had the look of pirated films."
5,Shirley Temple DVD's,"The three sets of DVDs I had you send to my daughter and her family were extremely well received. The relatively fast delivery along with the quality of the DVDs themselves, at least the ones they viewed thus far, are indicative of the good service I've had with Amazon in past purchases. I plan to continue as a customer for books and DVDs.Joe SchweyerIndian Harbour Beach, FL"
5,Great Classics,These are great movies and timeless classics. The picture and sound is great and we really love to watch them.
5,Wife is very happy,My wife is a long time fan of Shirley Temple and was so thrilled to receive these wonderful remastered movies.
5,Loved this!,I bought these videos for my niece for her birthday because she is like a little Shirley Temple. I was a little worried since they weren't animated like her favorite shows she wouldn't be interested in watching them. I was however happily surprised as she watched in amazement and danced around the living room. I also had no idea when I ordered these videos that you can watch them in black and white or in color which I think makes them even better!
5,Shirley Temple- America's Sweetheart Vol. 2,My husband and I both love all Shirley Temple memorabilia and were excited to receive Vol. 2 of her movie collection.The quailty of the CD's was exceptional and the pricing was much better than we expected.The product was shipped quickly and we will definately order again as we expand our collection.....A must have!We would highly reccomend it to all Shirley Temple fans.
5,film rematery and colorization,"Above average quality of film remastery and colorization. I am a pleased consumer and would recommend this product for any one who remembers, or wants to share 'curly top' with someone who didn't get to see her movies.Shirley Temple movies were something we looked forward to every Sunday afternoon growing up here in Detroit (Michigan). Enjoy!"
3,misleading,"This is a pretty good book and the author does a great job of evoking Arthur Canon Doyle's legendary characters but the title is a misnomer. For any reader expecting a return to the Scottish moors and the House of Baskervilles, they will be sorely disappointed. The hound in question is really just a minor subplot that felt hobbled on. It's as though the publisher came up with the title for sales purposes and the author complied by tacking on a side trip concerning a rabid hound but it covers less than maybe twenty pages if that."
1,DO NOT BUY IT,"Its does not ""Replaces Nokia BL-5F"" as the ""Product Features"" say. It is a ""BL-6C"" as the ""Product Details, Item model number: CLKBL6C"" state.I ended up with a BL-6C that did not fit my N95. Customer support argued that I was wrong ordering the product even after I pointed them to these incongruences on the product page, but if I send them the battery back they could refund me.Since I live in Buenos Aires the price of shipping it back was more then that of the battery and they said they will not take care of that, so I had to go directly to Amazon for a solution. The credited my card soon enough. Great Amazon customer service!Horrible Seller customer service. They didn't even corrected the page!Stay away from them!"
4,Good for the price,"Not super soft and they get pretty wrinkly out of the dryer, but they fit fine on my sons thick crib mattress and have held up so far."
5,a must for the serious dancer,"This DVD is one of the best on the market for veil work. The technique is clearly demonstrated from the front and the back and the movements increase in difficulty as the video progresses. Learn: the Roman Cape, the Burrito, Sharita, the helicopter, etc. Aziza is a true belly dance master and a pleasure to watch teaching and dancing."
1,Disappointing CD,"This CD is a huge disappointment to me. I love the organ music of Reger and Vierne, which is why I purchased the CD. David Craighead is a fine organist, from the famous Eastman School of Music of the prestigious University of Rochester. So, what went wrong? The organ and its acoustic space. The recording sounds as if it were made in a Kleenex Box underwater. There is no spaciousness,no reverberation. I would definitely not recommend this title to anyone."
4,"Excellent Peformance, Recording","The previous reviewer must have been listening to a different recording, or listening to it on inferior equipment. There is nothing wrong with this disc. This Reger/Vierne CD was engineered by the great John Eargle. The sound is clean and bright. That said, I prefer the sound of the Vierne Finale as played by Michael Farris on the Delos CDFrench Fireworks: The Symphonic Organonly because I like the sound of the Casavant organ used there more than the Rosales used here. David Craighead is the consummate organist. If you want an excellent CD with the Reger Sonata and the Vierne 6th Symphony this is as good as any, and the download price is excellent as well."
5,Kickin Drum and Bass beats!!!!!,"This has the most kickin drumm and bass beats that you'll everfind on a CD. The only thing I find weird about it is that they areall American originated,this is one of my favorite CD's."
1,DO NOT USE for a first course in abstract algebra,"The major problem I have with Artin is his stubborn reliance in teaching group theory via linear algebra. In my experience, undergraduate students encountering group theory for the first time have only a limited background in linear algebra, so using this text book forces students to cover two (albeit closely related) subjects at once. Also, Artin's discussion of the major areas (groups, rings, fields) is sufficient for the geometric applications that he enjoys, but feels lacking in the general theory. This book could be useful for some classes, but using it for a first course in abstract algebra will be a major disservice to students."
4,Good but needs a different organization,This book has an approach that is not intuitive. One commenter suggests to change how the chapters are organized. I heartily agree.
2,Dummit and Foote is the Better Text,"According to other reviewers, Dummit and Foote is dumbed down and easier to read, whereas Artin is for the very elite. The simple fact is that ""easier to read"" means the book is better. Artin is stenographic in brevity. If you cannot figure something out on your own, Artin will not help you. You will need your instructor or a better book to explain it. And later, when you have finished a semester or two of algebra but you need to recall whether a certain group has normal subgroups or how to prove some boring, tedious thing about rings, Artin will have your question listed as an exercise (completely useless to you, as always). Dummit and Foote will have the proof you need or an example very similar worked in full, concrete detail. Perhaps that is dumbed down, but it's useful and it's better. If you didn't need help, you would not have referred to a book at all."
4,fine,Book is in good shape as advertised. Don't particularly like the big USED sticker right across the middle of the front cover but the rest is fine. Slightly slow delivery but it arrived within the estimated time.
2,Classic.......,"My professor started the course by telling us how this was not only an amazing textbook, but one that we surely would want to keep and reread from time to time. He then went on to show himself to be the worst teacher I have encountered in college. This book may be beautifully written but is not a good textbook. If I had a great knowledge of the material (for example, was a great and self-absorbed mathematician with little to no teaching skills) I am sure I would enjoy this book. However, it is an awful way to introduce already difficult material to undergraduates. Hopefully, with multiple supplementary texts and additional courses on Algebra I will be able to go back and enjoy this book."
2,"The book was thoroughly confusing, and poorly written","This book is considered by many to be a classic. I consider it a classic waste of time. It does make an attempt at covering the whole gambit that is modern algebra, but sacrifices content to do it. There is a total lack of good examples. I CANNOT understate this. There are no useful examples in this book."
2,Paradoxically useless,"This book is useless for students enrolled in a college or university. As others mention, this book mimics lecture notes and doesn't follow the theorem-proof-example-excercise format. Why make a textbook of lecture notes? The students who learn from lectures don't need this book because they can attend real lectures, and this book is unusable for students who don't learn from lectures.EDIT: The presentation of the material is non-axiomatic, yet an axiomatic style is often what students are seeking when they turn away from lectures and turn to textbooks."
4,"Scissors are great, packaging was not","Just an inexpensive pair of lefty scissors, safe for my four year old to use, but when the package arrived, the scissors had escaped their package, which had come apart during shipment. Not a big deal, since my four year old didn't care whether it was in the packaging or not, but worth mentioning."
3,WARNING: BRAVO CASE IS NOT LEATHER,"The Bravo Case is not constructed of leather, it is made of vinyl material. Although not leather, the case fits the Blackberry very well, with an excellent magnetic closure, and a great belt clip that allows the case to be rotated and locked firmly in various positions. The three star rating is based on false advertising."
4,"Increasing the Odds, Sales is not a Numbers Game","Reading this book is like a trip through my sales carrier, but more. While reading I could relate to the situation, but see new ways to reach a positive result instead of hitting the wall.The author has a way of relating real situations. To often self-help sales books don't relate to real life.This is an easy read, keeps your attention with humor, and makes you take a good look at yourself, and how you go to market. Read this book if you want to feel like your there, and learn how to eacape the numbers game and the pain that goes with it, learn to have fun selling."
4,Spiritual Essence,"One of the things I enjoyed was how simple the book explained the Spiritual Essence of Angels. Throughout the book as you read, you'll begin comparing and finding similarites between what the author wrote and what you're experiencing. It's also good if you don't have the time to read because it's a small sized book yet it contains so much interesting information."
2,"Overview of every DBMS buzzword, but lacks of substance","Despite the size of this book, no in-depth details are given about Data Warehousing or OLAP. Product evaluations are minimal to the point of being useless. (OLAP product descriptions include Powerplay , but not Essbase or Express.) The data mining chapters are useful, but other books contain much more detail.I would recommend sticking to books dedicated to single topics such as Kimball's ""Datawarehouse Toolkit"" and Thomsen's ""OLAP Solutions"""
5,Great book- the olapmessageboard highly recommends this,"As some one who makes a living doing OLAP development, I thought the Author does a great job explaining the similarities and differences between OLAP and relational analysis. An emphasis is DW and DM was obviously present. So not the best OLAP book but maybe the best (or one of) in total architecture."
3,"Good breadth, little depth.","If new to the domain of Business Intelligence/Data Warehousing, this book will provide a better than average job of arming you with enough technical information to make you dangerous in your ""new territory"". However, if you're seeking more depth in any of the title's areas or are looking for something ""less-technical"" (e.g., more of a business justification), other books would serve as a better reference. Nonetheless, for its broad coverage, this book is a good addition to any BI/DW practitioner's technical library."
5,Excellent general explanation of Linux kernel innerworkings,"Excellent book, one of the best explanations of the inner workings of Linux kernel in general, goes way beyond IA64-specific issues. A must-read for anyone who wants to understand the essential kernel structures and responsibilites."
5,If Nick Cave did Alt Country This is what it would sound lik,"If Nick Cave did Alt Country This is what it would sound like. This CD is wonderful. Great dark moody pieces. The opening track is on a lot of compilations and I feel falls short of other tracks on the album like The Giant of Illionis, or My sisters Tinys hands. Great CD. Pick it up if you like Alt Country. It's indispensible if you like dark music and Alt. Country."
2,Not differentiated...,"You will hardly differentiate this album from many others sounding alike. Check Theo Bishop's Newport Nights - same tunes, same tempo, same lack of feelings. It is like chewing a piece of gum that has no taste."
3,Written by Youth for Youth!,"This book was writtend by Youth for Youth. If you with with experiential learning/activities and youth -- this is a good book to have. However, it is NOT a MUST BUY. There are better books out there -- but if you have some extra money -- this is an OK book. I don't regret purchasing it -- but there are better books."
4,Nice sign but it's pretty thin.,Nice looking sign but it's a little flimsy but I don't think it effect how it functions on the car.
5,Love this book & the sequel...they both bless my soul & my little animal lovin' heart,"My aunt was a licensed raptor rehabilitator and hearing her talk when I would visit... was a lot like reading J Allen Boone's book about Human Animal bonding... and what we can learn from animals. Easy to read, short chapters, hard to put down. I read this book & the sequel in one sitting each... but then I reread my fave parts! I was unfamiliar with these books & an older person recommended them. Surprised he was writing like this in the 1950s... less research on human/animal bonding then. I can't imagine an animal lover who would not enjoy both of these books."
5,Kinship with all Life,"My friend has a dog just like Strong Heart written about in this book. She also has a pet fly called Gerry. I would not believe it except I saw it for myself when I stayed with her recently. Gerry always greeted me in the morning. I just heard a buzzz near my right ear but I didn't see him/her until later on in the day or evening. The day I was leaving he/she spent more time buzzing near my ear, but again I didn't see him/her. My friend told me how nosey Gerry was to his detrement, one day he nearly drowned in a glass of her orange juice. She rescued him, he shook himself off like a wet dog and flew off. He is just an ordinary housefly but I don't remember hearing others buzzing the way Gerry does. She also has a Robin who comes into her kitchen and eats the crumbs on the floor."
1,ZZZZZ !,"I expected more from two of my favorite authors, but either it didn't gel between them or neither really wanted to put some effort into it. The premise is thin and the story line starts off slow and gets slower. You can't identify with any characters, (which are more two-dimensional that I've seen in any published work in years.) The finish is almost a relief, and you can see it coming by the third chapter. I'd avoid this book, even in paperback. Anyone want my copy? Cheap?"
3,A bit disappointing ...,"I've read most of Robert Asprin's books, and a lot of Esther M. Friesner's work, and I was disappointed with this. I wish I had waited for it in mass-market paperback, because I feel I paid too much for it. I have always liked Asprin and Friesner, and think they are both fine authors, but feel that this one was predictable in too many places, and not anywhere near as well crafted as I've come to expect from either of them. There were a couple of pleasant surprises, and it was a fun read, but not up to the quality I've come to expect from these authors."
4,Sibling Rivalry,"While I agree with other reviewers that the book ending was a little weak, I found myself really enjoying the character development. As the siblings each met with the same characters in different order, it gave the book continuity. The humor was more subdued than the two authors usually use, but it was perfect for this book."
5,BEAUTY AND THE BEAST,"I was thrilled to find the saga continue with Gerard's own storyline. I learned to love him as much as Louis (well, almost as much). To look past his darkness and find he truly has a heart...and the heroine, a woman that looks into that heart and finds the love of her life. A vampire at odds with 400 years of practiced survival skills, not remembering what it was like to be human and despising the weakness of ""love"". Laure, a strong and intelligent woman, who doesn't back down even when in the company of her husband, a self-proclaimed monster. I didn't put the book down until I'd devoured every bite. I eagerly await Midnight Gamble. I'm going to reread the first books in this vampire romance series, again. Thanks again Nancy Gideon! I'm glad Gerard did see the ""Light of the day!"""
3,Not Bad,Be careful when you first purchase this book. The copy I received was missing pages 65 - 96. Of the first part that I read I would have like to see Laure (the heroine)be stronger and smarter with regards to her step brother. I have read many other vampire/romance novels and I think more depth could have been put into the characters in this book.
4,Worth Reading!!!,Gerard is not necessarily a nice vampire normally but especially so when he has a human bride forced on him by a human blackmailer. He has no real regard for the humans around him except as food but yet we fall under his spell as he falls under the mortal Laure's spell. His dark and coldly brooding nature dissipates as we come to understand his behaviour hides a loving heart. Vodoo magic brings the action to a well deserved ending and we are left satisfied as we should be. This is quite nicely worth the read.
1,What a waste of money.,"I was really surprised with this book. I expected a great deal, but my expectations were not fulfilled. The story is slow, the characters uninteresting. I skipped pages and entire chapters just to finish it."
4,Stay - Sash! feat. La Trec,"UK CD Maxi Single Track Listing for -""STAY"" - SASH! feat. LA TREC1) Original Single Edit - 3:292) Eat Me Edit - 3:523) The Lisa Marie Vocal Experience - 8:374) Magnificent 4 Remix - 6:015) 2 Phunky People Remix - 5:546) Original 12"" - 5:551997"
5,Great!!,Very great quality product. One thing I noticed is that the slide out the handle end is a little wide to fit in some holes compared to ones of my co workers. Am very satisfied overall!!
2,Rudie from San Antonio,"It's the same old Pop-Punk that's become extremely popular as of late. The songs sound just the same as anyother band of their type. But I have seen them live and it has made me hate this more then anything else for every single song they donated it ""to the girls"" and I can never forgive them for sitting thru that hour long set of hell."
3,"Hey man, what's the dillio?","I went out and bought this cd last tuesday. When I popped it in, I can't say I wasn't a little dissapointed. I listened to clips of a few of the songs before I bought it, and it sounded pretty good. When I went out and bought the cd, the music, style, ect was good. But when I listened to the lyrics, thats when I was dissapointed. I believe someone already pointed this out, but they're the same old same old you've been hearing for nearly a decade, only cornier. You've gotta cut them some slack though. This is their debut album and I'm sure I couldn't do any better (very sure). I still like them. What's the Dillio is one of the coolest songs ever, but I should've just bought the single."
5,Mest - Wasting Time,"This cd is a must for anyone who's into punk music such as Fenix-tx, Blink 182, Good Charlotte, Goldfinger, etc. I saw Mest live for the first time a year ago and have been a die hard fan ever since. This album is beyond fantastic, and they are better live. Personal favorite tracks are ""Drawing Board"" and ""Richard Marxism"". Give it a listen and you won't be able to put it down, I promise!"
4,fun pop/punk,"these guys aren't real punk, their lyrics aren't emotionally driven and their sound isn't original...BUT...this cd is still worth buying just for something to listen to in the summer. it's fun pop/punk, just right for hanging out with friends or driving with the windows down, it's worth it"
3,The Pop-punk son Goldfinger never(?) had,"I bought this CD after hearing about it from a Goldfinger fan, who called them ""mini-Goldfinger."" I'm a ska-punk fan, so I went out and bought it. It turns out that the CD went much further in the way of MxPx than Goldfinger, due to the lack of ska sound on the album. Don't get me wrong, if you like MxPx AND Goldfinger, then you'll like this CD. Personally, I feel it's a little too pop for me, and end up listening to only the first half of the CD normally. Thankfully, it didn't turn out as bad as SR-71, but it's still no Goldfinger. ""What's the Dillio?"" isn't the best song on the CD, but I personally think it's one of the better ones; my favorite is ""Hotel Room."""
5,Excellent songs,"This is a cd you can leave in and listen to every song, because they're all different and they're all good. You won't get bored. John Feldmann did an excellent job producing this record."
5,Milwaukie's Best.,Mest owns. This album is their best yet. A huge improvement from MMM40s and I think the album is better than destination unknown. Support those messups and buy their music.
4,mest is the best,"Alot of you probley are wondering who mest is. Well if your a goldfinger, green day and yes even a blink 182 fan then you will like these guys. Their on the verge of something big, I can promise you that. I'm a fan of blink 182, green day and golfinger. But mest not very well known. I would have to say better then all 3 of them. Buy their cd, give it a try you wont be dissapointed."
1,this CD is mest up,"every song is a stupid, poorly written love song. they have such simple lyrics like rhyming day with day, you and do, see and me. dont buy this!!!!!!!!"
3,"Certainly not inventive or original, but a good listen nonetheless.","I agree thoroughly with the comments that MEST are similar to and interchangable with their pop-punk contemporaries of the same era (Blink-182, Green Day etc) and they are certainly not breaking any new ground with this album. Despite the desperately immature lyrics that could almost be believed to be self parody, it is undeniably an album with many catchy songs such as ""Drawing Board"" and ""Change"" and is well worth a listen. Despite the connotations of self-centred teenage life, MEST are certainly a class above bands of a similar breed that followed later such as Fall Out Boy.In short: this album will not change your life or change your musical direction... however, taken at face value for what it was meant to be (a simplistic pop-punk album) it is certainly enjoyable to put in the stereo every now again."
2,Was this a high school project?,So the subject is far fringe..get that. I even get the whole Harry Potter wizard rock thing. What I don't get is fifteen minutes of footage of trees.....
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I've read several of Angela Elwell Hunt's books before and always enjoyed them, but I picked this one up the other day and couldn't put it down! All of the sudden I looked up and realized it was 3 am and it took everything in me to put off finishing it until the next night. From the first chapter this book draws you in and takes off at a pace that never allows you to get bored. This book has the suspense and pacing of secular books like The Da Vinci Code, but this one is grounded in God's love and truth. I guarantee you willnot be disappointed if you give this book a try."
2,Not Believable,"This book was interesting but one that I could walk away from. I finished it because I finish 99.9% of the books I begin. It was predictable and a bit silly. I call it silly because that is the word I use when things are unbelievable. I am not talking about the little boy's special gift. I am referring to many of the events that occur, especially toward the end of the book. Not one I would care to read or even recommend. Sorry, but true."
2,"A New Guitarist, A Bland Sound","Gone were all the unique qualities that set Budgie apart from other heavy rock acts. Tony Bourge's guitar was the key to the greatness of their early material. Nightflight is just an attempt to get more commercial, with a guitarist that sounded just like everybody else circa 1980. This record is bland, yet still listenable; I understand that things got much worse."
4,Some of the best work of their career,"Budgie went for a more pop style on this album, but also mixed in a greater degree of AC/DC style metal, going from a blues/rock band of inconsistent output to an excellent pop band wielding its metal well. The last three tracks fizzle to some degree, but the rest are some of the most imaginative from this band, even if the guitar steps aside to let the song and not the riff create the atmosphere."
5,Great,"This is a great book. It gets you right in with the action and keeps you reading. What is amazing is that it is real reality and not fiction. Lots of little details are thrown in at the appropriate times, for information and education. Really easy to read and also easy to read in small sections at a time."
1,WTF?,"Ollie North, distinguished in war as he may be, was shown to be a criminal who has the ability and does lie to Congress, as evidenced in the Iran-Contra hearings. His viewpoints on anything beyond why he isn't in jail are not taken kindly."
1,Wertheim's assesements were groundless and unsupported.,"As a student of an Ivy League Institution, I thought that Wertheim's ""man-bashing"" was inappropriate and unfounded. Her interpretation of historical facts were deceptive and misleading. She twisted these facts in conniving ways to support her feminist thesis."
4,strathwood teak two-seater bench,"Look Good, but needed a small alt. to make bottom fit. No big problem that a small jig saw can't fix. Over all a great bench."
5,Amazing music,"I have the casette of this album, and I wish I had the disc. It has some of the most vibrant and unique melodies in existance. They really have a life of their own, and there's nothing quite like them on a long quiet drive. I highly recommend this, it's unlike anything else I've ever heard. Beautiful."
2,Audiophile wannabe.,"This is one of those sad attempts to create some audiophile excitement with an totally impractical dynamic range. There is even a warning on the back that the gunshots in Billy the Kid can harm your speakers! The secret to this is to record most of the music at such a low level that you can hardly hear it, so you have to crank up your volume control, and then they can let loose with those ear-shattering and speaker-blowing effects. Why? I'm reminded of Monty Python's ""spring surprise"" candy.I can't say I'm at all impressed with the performances, either. Soporific is the easiest way to describe them. My mind completely wandered off during ""Sunset"".Track down a copy of Paul Whiteman conducting the Grand Canyon Suite. That's the way it should be done."
4,great playing but recorded too low,"My review is mainly just to second the other review. Schwarz and the Seattle Symphony do a fine job with these pieces. It is so unfortunate that the recording level was set so as to make for a lack of presence. The engineers did pick up bass drum and timpani very well, and a system with a good subwoofer will really bring them out--it's just that the faithful reproduction of percussion is somewhat jarring because they come out great but everything else is still too distant. For the performances on this CD plus the low price I paid I can recommend it; just be prepared for less thanperfect sound."
5,"FANTASTIC ALBUM, BUY OR DIE!","THIS IS A MASSIVE MELODIC PROGRESSIVE OPUS OF AN ALBUM, COMPARE WITH THE BEST FROM DREAM THEATER AND QUEENSRYCHE....AMAZING!"
2,Disappointed,"Given the wonderful work in secular education (pedagogical and andragogical)that is available and the great reputation of this book, I was very disappointed in the content. It is simply a random collection of articles and perspectives. Great thought, but not much use."
4,Excellent Movie,"The person or rather the ""Kid"" wrote the review telling people not to see this movie I think missed the whole point of the story and should watch it again. This story was not about giving up. Alzheimer's Disease is hardly one that I would say so far no one in the medical world has found a cure for. It shows the deep faith and deep love the husband had for his wife and for his belief in Christ. We are all handed some cross or burden to bear and apparently this ""Kid"" has yet to go thru something so strong as this story to test his faith. And if nothing else, it holds value as a family movie for once with clean language.Please, do watch the movie."
4,good tear jerker heart pricking film,This film gives a great biblical view of marriage and really brings home a godly view of commitment in marriage. I use it for marriage counseling sessions.
5,Joshua Series,"You don't have to be a Theologin to appreciate the series of Joshua. Faith has nothing to do with it. If we simply research the writings of Christ and verify the facts we'd see. Therefore, reading about a Christ like figure should not give people disdain feelings. If Christ was to come back today amongst us as in the Bible we would see simialar events as in every Joshua seried writing. Therefore, we should not feel some state of nausea or that we've been cheated by a fairytale.. To me Joshua and the City along with the rest of Father J. Grizone's books are uplifting and beautiful in it's depictions of all things that are good in this world."
1,Unfortunate for the City,"(The reviewer is actually Joy Class. I don't understand how my son's setting up my account would make it appear that he's the reviewer, when Amazon requested that ""Joy"" review the book.) Since I'm part of a world-wide movement to observe the Luke 10:10 principles for prayer evangelism to Transform Our World, I can't subscribe to the unbiblical concept of relegating leadership of help for the city to Mary. The Holy Spirit gives gifts and callings to all Christians to be marketplace ministers -- in education, government, and business -- for bringing the Kingdom of God to their cities. I so enjoyed and believe the JOSHUA book because it took personally the call of Christ, but this one is too focused on Catholic doctrine for me to share or apply to my experience of Jesus' love for our cities. Catholics might really enjoy this book, and the author is great. But had I known the Mary doctrine would appear, I would not have purchased it."
3,A little too sermony; but still good.,"I fully enjoyed the movie Joshua which led me to buy this book on tape. I am glad I have it. It only cost me a few bucks; but now, these were my disappointments: I thought the movie Joshua had a too propagandic ending and thought that it should have been cut. The book was far worse, and actually on occasion out right interrupted the story line to tell the reader what was right and what was wrong about religion and life in a sermon style. Okay so that was my first big disappointment. Second was: this spun a whole fairy tale world around Joshua that was so outrages I couldn't even believe it for a fairy tale. But I still did and still do enjoy the book just be ware of some propaganda."
1,Don't buy Air Venturi!,"They did not puncture or pierce correctly inside my rifle, and leaked inside the rifle's frame. Then, I tried the second one. The second one did not seat at all, and had a slow leak which I was able to get off two rounds before it died. Go with Crosman!"
4,Scary read,"This is a review for the free Kindle version.A good psychological thriller. What really happened in the forest? Especially once the tracks are covered by snow.The Wendigo is very short, but it does a good job of taking you into a primeval forest, knowing that there is something out there. And you really don't want to find it. And the poor guide, ugh.Considering how quick a read it is, I would suggest that anyone with a Kindle give it a shot. You only have a small amount of time that you will be out."
1,Great book! Don't buy this version.,"The Wendigo is another shining example of the mastery of Blackwood, Algernon Blackwood. Not Albert. This publishing company doesn't deserve one cent for the reprinting of this wonderful book. They're so lazy and uninterested they didn't even bother to check what the author's name was. Shame on them. Shame! Buy this book by all means but buy it from someone else."
5,Excellent Series - Insane Price!!!,"If you teach American History in high school (or college), this is a fantastic series of videos that take the viewer from 1492-2000 (if you buy both sets). You can also buy the book that correlates with the DVDS. I have used this series for years and originally purchased them for about $40-50 each. Now they want $800! I am going to assume that this is because they are out of print and thus the price has become exorbitant. I would encourage teachers to clamor for a reprint so that this highly valuable resource can be made affordable and therefore much more accessible. Easily the best video resource for American History out there."
4,Atomic 50s thriller,"Very good print of an obscure, well-made kidnapping film with good performances by some old pros and an atmospheric score by Leith Stevens."
4,"Your Brain, The Perfect Instrument","Wattles, in all his writings, is the master of simplicity in explaining that we are gods amongst gods, provided with everything we require in discovering our destiny.""That which is in you impelling you forward is in the things and people you need, impelling them toward you.""""Nothing was ever in any man that is not in you; no man ever had more spiritual or mental power than you can attain, or did greater things than you can accomplish. You can become what you want to be""First published in 1911, it is tinted with language of the day, but do not let that prevent you from discovering gold. It is one of those old ""secret"" books that have been fortunately reprinted. You need to read it at least twice before you appreciate what is transpiring. Behind the transparent words is an empire of knowledge."
2,"There is a better, cheaper product available","For [$] you can get the book ""Learn to Program with Visual Basic 6"" by John Smiley. It is for beginners, comes with a CD, and is very easy to understand."
1,Review fo your product description,I'd like to see a succint description of the differences between VB6.0 Profeesional and VB6.0 learning edition. I haven't seen this any where.
2,Disappointing,"This product was very good at showing the basic principles of Visual Basic but after the initial example program, the text became very technical, defintely not for the first time programmer ( there was absolutely no help in learning to write code).The examples were next to impossible to find on the accompanying software. File names were different from those cited in the book.Overall I would not recommend this product but would steer the beginner towards John Smiley's products."
4,"If your a beginner, read this","This product is visual basic 6 for beginners. Do not think that this software will teach you how to write vb code, it wont, I know, ha ha. Im a senior in college who learned how to write vb from a book called, visual basic 6.0, step by step, the author is Michael Halvorson. This is an excellent book for the ""beginner"", who wants directions on how to do everything. Its a very well written book, and if you by that book with this software, youll be and intermediate level vb programmer in no time. Just remember, buy the step by step book, unless your not a programming beginner."
3,Visual BASIC,"This product is excellent to learn to program. It gives you the feeling of the internal workings of a program. But, once you get past the beginning stage, it becomes very annoying. There are too many variable types and makes programs slow and take up much memory. Must use good programming style and techniques to prevent many possible errors. Still, I use it for a lot of my programs using large databases."
4,Kindred Spirit,"As a child of the praries I could relate to Claire Drainie Taylor's early life. It was almost like reading about my own upbringing. The bone chilling winters and the vast expanses of prarie sky and field. But it was the rest of her life story that really grabbed me. 3 husbands, 6 children, and an acting career - this woman had an interesting life! I liked her breezy and witty writing style. I thought this would be a womans book and I had intended to give it to my mother, but as I got hooked into it, I realized it had broad appeal. I would recommend it for anyone who wants an entertaining read about a person you never heard of."
3,There are Better,This syringe case does what is was made for. I just wish the quality was better.The case is hard to open and doesn't hold the plunger very well. The hinge wears too quickly if carried in a purse or suitcase.Medicool has much better quality for about the same price.
1,horrible trash,I friend had this cd and made me listen to it. It was the worst CD I ever heard. She has ruined great songs with her slow morbid style which would put anyone to sleep. Thank God I didnt buy it.
1,horrible trash,A friend let me listen to this CD and it was a very bad piece of trash. Very slow and maudlin and no zip to it at all. Avoid this at all costs.
2,Snooze,"I just thought this book started out with promise, but really started to lag during the middle all the way towards the end. It was just so slow and I kept yelling at myself that something needed to happen! I didn't feel the main character solved anything especially when it seemed like Jackson was supposed to be some big thing to her. Then at the end I got totally bored and I was expecting to turn the page and at least have 10 or so more pages, not a couple sentences. It really caught me off guard how abruptly it ended. This is my first read from this particular author so maybe it was just this one book, but to me wasn't worth the try."
3,Word Families,This is a little difficult for the kids I was going to work with. Maybe I will be able to use it a little later in the year with them.
2,Not what I expected,"I recently switched to 2nd grade, so I bought this book to review phonics and spelling skills. However, I found the pages very similar to the Four-Block making words activities (by Carson Dellosa), which our school had already purchased. I ended up not using the book after I purchased it due to that fact. If you already have/use the Four-Block activites in your classroom, then this book would not benefit your class. If you don't have the Four-Block working with words book, then this would be a great substitute."
5,Great introduction to reading,"I found this book extremely helpful for young children in my resouce program. It was especially easy to use with learning disabled children who need a hands on or kinesthetic approach to reading. It can be used with a variety of reading programs including LiPS, Project Read, or Corrective Reading. It can also stand alone in your reading program."
5,"Review of ""Inspire...""","Within 5 pages of beginning my reading of ""Inspire..."", I was enthralled. Lance writes so eloquently and powerfully of a way of being in corporate life (and life in general) and how each of us can impact positive change as leaders in our individualized way. Want to make a greater difference in your life's circle? Read, read, read this book!"
5,Fantastic!,At first it seemed like another textbook on economic growth with the good old end-of-chapter questions. After a closer look I realized this is a really sophisticated piece of economic literature. I believe the main difference from other books in the field lies in the blend of rigorous mathematical analysis and necessary - but always forgotten - historical perspective. A must read!
1,Find someone else to read this great collection of poetry,"Loose Woman is a gathering of earthy, sexy, raunchy, cool, and lyrical poems. Celebrations of the pleasures of being a Woman, they cry out to be heard aloud, so when I saw this cassette I snapped it up. If anyone could do justice to this poety, I figured, it would be the Gal who wrote it. Imagine my utter dismay at hearing Cisneros' thin, high-pitched voice attempt ""You Bring Out the Mexican in Me."" Cisneros' voice is so annoying I couldn't finish the cassette; it set my nerves on edge. I ended up not only disappointed in my purchase, but disgusted at the conceit of Cisneros reading her own poetry rather than acknowledging that she did not have the voice to match her smoky pen."
2,weak,"Cisneros created The House on Mango Street, which is in my opinion, one of the great modern masterpieces. I'm not familiar with her other fiction, so I don't know if she is a one hit wonder or not. I do know that her poetry is not very well done. I don't know, I expected a group of sensual or sexual poems along the lines of Sarah Cortez or Kim Addonizio. What I got were substandard poems, that were a pain to try to read. Pass this collection on by and pick up Cortez's How to Undress a Cop or any poetry collection by Kim Addonizio."
5,Great CD!,"This is a great CD, with many great artists, and not completely focused on one format of music! I love it! It has rock, (Smash Mouth, blink-182, Train) teen-bop, (Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, Mandy Moore, Hanson) R&B, (Aaliyah, Joe, Montell Jordan, Sonique) Latin, (Marc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez) and a few other cool artists! (Ben Harper, Macy Gray, Eiffel 65, Savage Garden, Lenny Kravitz.) It is great for the pop listener who likes all types of pop music!"
4,Pretty Good,"I thought the three previous NOW cds were not that great. NOW 4 however, had a lot of great songs that you could listen to when you were sad or you needed needed something to dance to. The only thing about this CD that sort of was annoying was that some of the songs are not really new, (being 3 or 4 years old.)"
1,Item never received,"This cd was never received by the person I sent it to, Neil Lilliedoll at 24439 Fairway Dr., Davis, CA 95616. I did pay the VISA bill before I realized this. I didn't know how to complain to Amazon because I didn't have my order number. I just looked it up & it was sent so I don't know what happened to it. B. Peck"
2,I couldn't give anything with Blink-182 on it 1 star,"""All The Small Things"" is the only good song. Now I know why people say Blink-182 are a boy band. They should not be on this CD. They should be with Sum 41, Green Day, and New Found Glory, not Nsuck and Backstreetgirls."
4,NOW 4 ROCKS,this cd is great! here are the songs. 1. bactsteet boys larger than life. soso song . 2.britney spears. drive me crazy. she drives me ........ !3. mark anthony i need to know. you need to know how good he is!
2,Not so good...,"...well maybe more like mediocre. This album might be OK if you don't listen to the radio a lot, but if you do I wouldn't bother with this. Almost all of the songs have been so overplayed on the radio it's ridiculous, and the ones that haven't just aren't good. I am so tired of hearing the majority of these songs. Most of them were good at first, but have just gotten more and more annoying ever time I hear them."
4,A huge suprise for success,"I bought Now2 because it had some songs that I thought were pretty good, but one hit wonders, I then bought Now3 because I thought it would be as good. It has a couple of good songs but I was thoroughly suprised when Now 4 came out. I watched the preview on tv and said ""Oh my gosh!"" They have Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, Mandy Moore and Effiel 65 on the same cd!"" Then I looked at the whole album, they had Train and Blink 182 and even a bizzare Maci Gray. For the R&B lovers there is Sonique, Joe, Aaliyah, and Maci Gray.Whatever your interest in music is the is a cd for fans of any type of music."
3,Now's weak link,"This is probably the weakest of the US Now compilations. Songs are not hits (Hanson & Ben Harper) and are annoying (Backsteet Boys & Eiffel 65). This compilation would be better if it had been released EARLIER! By the time this was out most of the songs had already been played to death on Top 40 radio (save the then fresh, but also soon overplayed ""Try Again"" by Aaliyah). This album did reach number one, and it's follow up number 2, so maybe Now 6 will be fresh..."
5,Get this CD! its great,i got this CD because now 3 rocked. i got it because i hate switching CDs it gets so anoying when you have to. So i can just put in 1 CD and keep it in. BUY IT TODAY!
1,you have to be kidding?,this is a Sorry Excuse for a Disc&To be Charged for Everything that you can Record off of Tv or The Radio&then Burn it onto a Disc.it's Sad when a Compilation is The Best Selling Record in The Country Where are The Artists At?this Makes those old K-Tel Records look Legit.these songs have been played to death.
1,Definitely for TRL fans,"I don't have this cd (and I don't plan to get it, either!), but I've seen the ad enough to know what's on here and I have to say something. Come on. Annyone who listens to the radio has heard these songs. Most of the songs are teeny-bopper pop (ie,Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, etc.) Blink 182 is on here, but the song is All the Small Things, a HUGE victim of overplay. And the songs by Macy Gray & Savage Garden are awful, even though they've both had good songs before (see ""Do Something"" by Macy Gray, ""Crash & Burn"" by Savage Garden).The kids who watch TRL religiously will probably like this for simply not knowing better. Everyone eles will roll their eyes."
3,only upto ntwicm 4,"come on you yanks, (thats the music big knobs not the general population)this concept was obviously born in good old blighty. we are currently on volumn 46 and most of these are double cds not just singles. you are obviously dragging your heals. anyway, enough of trivial matters the british versions also cover a good selection of music tastes. and on a broard spectrum of tastes too. my collection of these cd's started at volume 20 that was nearly 10 years ago!! i am still bying them as they are released to.happy listening"
1,MORE pop garbage shoved into your face,"If you call this music,then you need to have your head examined!this is just a bunch of pop trash slapped onto a CD-a real waste of a good CD,if you ask me.This is'nt REAL music like Mamas&Papas,ABBA or Alan Jackson-this is just cheap garbage produced by money-hungry artists.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,A great CD with good tracks,"Some of the best songs are on this one CD--Mandy Moore's ""Candy"", Britney Spears' ""(You Drive Me) Crazy"", Backstreet Boys' ""Larger Than Life"", Aaliyah's ""Try Again"", Smash Mouth's ""Then The Morning Comes"", Blink 182's ""All The Small Things"", Eiffel 65's ""Blue"", and a few other great tracks. I own this CD and I'm proud of it."
3,"Ummm, well it's okay","The CD itself is just kind of late. I bet most people already heard the songs one too many times already such as ""I Need to Know"", by Marc Anthony, or ""It Feels So Good"" by Sonique. There are also some songs that are just stupid like Blue, which if u just heard it for the first time, u never want to hear it again. There are also some classics like as the Backstreet Boys, BLink 182, and Mandy, and also some new ones in there too. So, if u really want to get a CD (I MEAN REALLY, REALLY WANT ONE), buy it even though it's only worth half the money."
4,andrewman,"this is the best cd ever.because there are a lot of artists on there like smash mouth, and blink 182. my favorite song is ""Blue"" by Eifel65"
5,Now That's What I Call Music 4,I received this disc as early as I expected. I enjoy listening to this disc over and over again. What an EXCELLENT JOB that you did! Thank you for taking care of your customers first. Keep it up!
4,"Pretty Good CD, at all","This CD is good at all. I Rate it 4 stars because the songs are very old for the date of the release April 2000. Backstreet Boys - Larger Than Life (4 stars/ Very good but old!) Britney Spears - Crazy (5 stars/ I love it but it is really old for this collection (series) because the original release date is September 1999). Eiffel 65 - Blue (Da ba DEE) (5 stars / is the newest of the collection!) OK, The CD have rated 5 stars if it was released in November 1999 but April 2000 must have hits like ""Show Me The Meaning"" by BSB, ""Oops!... I Did It Again"" by Britney, etc. It is a good CD to listen, if you don't interest the relase date. Pretty good to buy it! AMAZON.COM! Thanks for your attention... Luciano"
2,Not too great.,"I would say from 1-10, I would say 3 or 4. By now people say that these songs are old and they are right. Now, people listen to Now 14 or Now 55. I would probably listen to this cd about maybe once every three weeks."
3,Good for 13-14 year olds,"The NOW series has generaly safe music that is popular among young teens around 13-14 years old. This is pretty much ""Back Street Boyz"" type music - harmless and little kids love it. Some of the songs are even catchy (though honestly most of it wouldn't appeal to anyone who's been out in the world)."
3,"Now 4, It's OK",i thought this cd was sometimes interasting to lisen to but about half the songs i have never heard of. the best songs were probily the one by the Backstreet Boys and Britany Spears. But If I were you I wouldn't buy I did and i thought it was a waste of money!
4,A Gem Of An Album,"This CD dates back to the 1980's, but its roots are far deeper than that. Here the Welsh rock 'n' roll legend trawls through the jumpin' jive back catalogue to produce a swinging, powerful album. It leaves his former co-star, Shakin' Stevens standing, as Louie blasts through a rockin' good repertoire of hits from the likes of Bulmoose Jackson and Wyonie Harris . Rockin' Louie offers us a perfect pastiche and his ""recreated"" sound leaves us hankering for more. Its a shame that Charley Records (the original label) didn't persuade Louie to follow through on this stunning album."

4,True. Independent. Creative. Metal.,"This album is crafted very meticulously. Each sweeping pass with Marc's guitar, each insanely fast drum fill, and ""The Higler's"" wonderfully light bass style display how well this band works together. The recording quality has a great ""grit"" to it that only truly independent recording artists can use to their advantage. The complex rhythms coming from the the guitar, bass, drums, and vocalist are very tightly executed.If heavy (and VERY melodic) progressive metal with a subtle, yet clear influence of progressive jazz is your style, this album will not come out of your cd player (or MP3 Player) for a long time. Make sure to note that Marc is the only ""ONE"" playing guitar throughout the entire album. This is a truly talented group of guys.OTHER BANDS TO CHECK OUT:* After the Burial* Born of Osiris* The Number 12 Looks Like You* The Faceless* Meshuggah* Between The Buried and Me"
5,"a must have cd for onj fans,superb,a collectors item","i have been an onj fan since i first heard her songs way back in 1972.i have all her early recordings recorded in vinyl, to eight tracks,cassettes and of course the latest in cds.i have watched her performances on tv specials and last summer of 2003,i saw her live performance in seattle,washington where i now call my third home.what could i say? it was an experience of a lifetime.she moved me,she took my breath away!..and now this cd, i bought it right away when it hit the music store..and i rate it a five star.."
4,A Welcome Return - Classic ONJ,"With a stunning vocal performance, Olivia Newton-John once again proves her lasting style with a sophisticated tribute to women in music. From the dreamy vocals of ""How Insensitive"" to the freshly drawn ""Alfie,"" the singer's depth and range has rarely sounded better. Soft and whimsical, then heartfelt and gutteral, ""How Glad I Am"" is a standout, bringing to mind Petula Clark AND Alicia Keys. Newton-John has been criticized for playing it safe and sounding whitebread. But here she once again breaks the mold, delivering emotion-packed phrasing that serves each lyric in intimate, sponteneous ways. A wonderful collection for any ONJ fan, new or old."
5,Excellent book on K-9 Tactics,"This book is filled with great information. It is helpful for the Police Administrator, Back-up Officers and K-9 Handlers. It fills in the void from Technical Training of the Dog to actual street application. Through this book you can learn from others experiences. It is a great starting point for new handlers and some new ideas for seasoned ones. With the info given you can easily adapt it to your current program."
4,Great Book,Deliverd as promised.Great book with greater insight into the rulers of Rome as they more likely were.
2,Historical Hatchet Job,"The classifies as rewriting history with eggs on the faces of all the great men; some deserved it, others may not have.Like the books that 40 years later talk about the sex livesof famous presidents, this book sets out to make people like Octaviusand Julius Caesar look bad. Like saying Jesus had a son by Mary Magdaleneor saying Jesus was a magician who used ""tricks"",this book takes men who were deified and tries to make them look as black as possibleby telling all the rumors and lies that went around.These are not the biographies you find in the history book or encyclopedias,but what their enemies might have said about them.Today, we don't call this writing history, but yellow journalism.It sold books even in ancient times."
3,Brief Review of Suetonius,"Suetonius' achievement is his brevity. He gives us the significant events in the rulership of each Caesar, some of their virtues and vices, and a few opinions. Plutarch is the better writer of style and narrative, but Suetonius suffices. The book is easy enough to read, and has a lot of anecdotes that are memorable.His history makes Seneca's tragedies more realistic in the savage atrocities committed. The sacrifices of Astyanax and Polyxena in Seneca's The Trojan Women are believable. In light of Suetonius' history, I don't know that Seneca's tragedies had the shock value then that they have since. The use of ghosts are consistent between Suetonius and Seneca. Suetonius does not mythologize, except perhaps in stories of omens. If he reports legends or rumors, which is infrequent, he will usually say so."
5,The Best of Roman Tabloids,"Don't be put off by the antiquity of this book, its a fascinating look at the tremendous heights of empirical glory and despotism that kicked off the Roman Empire. From the ravenously ambitious Julius to the brilliant government of Augustus to the mad and criminal excesses of Tiberius, Caligula and Nero, Suetonius brings the first 12 emperors to life in brilliant detail and color. This book is the perfect meeting of History Channel and tabloid, a must read for any history buff, or anyone who wants a taste of the fantastic world that was ancient Rome."
5,Simply Epic,"I had heard that Seutonius' usage of what were household names referring to prominent Roman citizens could be initially slightly discouraging for the casual reader - but they weren't. It is simply an epic read. Structured, to the point, at times gory, but gives great insight into the personalities of Julius Caesar and the following 11 emperors, and a glimpse into Roman life at the time. I couldn't put it down. It may be difficult to dissect Seutonius' own influence from the writing, but that just adds to the drama..."
4,Fun Roman gossip,"The Twelve Caesars is notorious as a source of gossip about the Roman Emperors. Unlike many histories written by ancient historians, this makes it not only lively but a fun read. Not everything Suetonius says can be believed, but I've heard many of the most salacious anecdotes recounted in other more reliable histories.Twelve Caesars isn't an introduction to the Roman Empire, as many readers seen to believe. I'd recommend reading a good general history before venturing into this book because Suetonius doesn't provide much context and sometimes tells biographical details out of chronological order. Still, if you want to dig deeper into the Roman emperors' lives, Suetonius is a good choice."
1,Disappointing,"While this is a very talented group with excellent harmony, their second offering was a big disappointment. After listening to this CD several times, I just couldn't find a title that ""caught on"". It was almost like they were looking for a new sound. Their first album, DAKOTA MOON was far superior. I couldn't believe the two albums came from the same group."
3,"Good book, but unremarkable...","I mentioned to a friend that I was reading this book and she asked what I thought about it. I said that I liked the book, but that it was not one that I would probably remember months from now.This book tells an interesting story, and I liked the way the chapters alternated between characters, but the reader really needs to suspend disbelief in order to buy into the story. A pleasant enough book to read with interesting characters, but unfortunately entirely forgettable."
3,"Beginnina was Great, ending, Not so great!","I was really looking forward to reading this book. It was recomended in Newsweek Magazine I think or maybe Time. Anyways I read it in two days. I loved the beginning of the book and even in the middle I was thinking ""this book is great"" but I will say this..I was very dissapointed with the ending. I guess I was waiting for something to happen OR I was waiting for the author to elaborate on Francesca's ""mental illness"" a little more or SOMETHING! I felt like I was reading and reading and awaiting something wonderfull and I felt totally let down by the ending. I did enjoy how the story was told by diff people. I would have liked to know more about Chester and Francesca. I thought we learned too much about Anne and Sid and they were not REALLY the main characters of the book. I have to say I was dissapointed when I finally put the book down!"
4,A mystery in these pages...,"Throughout the book, you'll be asking yourself if Francesca truly is the religious icon her community comes to believe she is. Is she carrying an immaculate conception? Can she heal people with a touch? Well told, this story is one you'll find as thought provoking as it is entertaining."
3,medication is the answer,"**Spoilers in here, so don't read this review if you don't want to know what happens.I enjoyed the book and was anticipating an ending that would leave me pensive for a few days - it seemed it could be heading that way. Instead, Chester gets medication that cures the reasons for his homelessness, Francesca gets medication that results in her realizing she's not the Virgin after all, and the kid who was denied medication ends up dying. The message I got from the book is that medication is very good.So, I was a bit disappointed by the time I got to the end. For a book that was otherwise an enjoyable read and which had potential to step around the usual notions of holy figures and spirituality, it seemed a bit of a cop-out to tie up all the loose ends so neatly."
5,Not what I expected...,"This book was not what I expected but was wonderful nevertheless.. Francesca Dunn is a 14 year old girl on the cusp of becoming a woman but still very much a child, her parents have recently divorced and she feels abandoned by her previously doting father whose dream it was for Francesca to be a famous celloist.. She begins to realize she is not the prodigy her father had hoped for, at about the same time as a homeless man at the soup kitchen where she works announces that she is the virgin mother.. a frenzy of adulation ensues.. making Francesca feel special once again and her mother doubt her daughters sanity.. told in the alternating pov's of Anne the mother, Francesca, her bestfriend Sid and the homeless man Chester.. Excellent I highly recommend this book."
3,"Nice read, interesting first novel","Not the most remarkable book I've read recently, but an impressive debut novel with unusual characters and a theme (i.e., what is God? Is God mental illness?) that I found very appealing. Book seems to assert that what our society labels mental illness is what past societies would have labeled mysticism or sainthood. A nice light summer read that still makes you think."
2,No wonder it's out of print,"I found this book at my parents house and asked to borrow it for some reading material for a plane trip. Parts of it were interesting and I actually liked the authors unusual sense of humor, but it really didn't hold my attention the whole time and the transitions between the different scenes were pretty jumpy and didn't flow well. It wasn't a bad book at all, but certainly nothing special."
2,Cute - But Inferior to the source,"The high point of the film is when Robert DeNiro, as Fearless Leader, confronts Boris (Jason Alexander) over the news the ""Moose and Squirrel"" have escaped again.DeNiro adjusts his monacle, and asks:""Are you talking to me? Are you talking to ME? You MUST be talking to me, because no one else is here!""Of course, if you've never seen 'Taxi Driver' it's not funny.Since I have, I fell off the couch..."
1,Childhood Memories Destroyed,"Oh how disappointing!!!!!Rocky and Bullwinkle should have been a natural for those of us who grew up with the cartoon. The simple, yet endearing, themes of the cartoons could have been produced via the marvels of modern computer animation into a funfest for both kids and adults. Sadly, this attempt missed every single mark.The story line had promise, but it was left unfulfilled. The implementation appeared to be clearly aimed at 4 year olds, except the adult themes and gimicks wouldn't have been understood. The characters were petty, lacking in charm, and poorly acted. How, in the name of heaven, did they miss the opportunity to cast Danny DeVito as Boris???? Would have been a natural. The female lead came across as selfish and inept (but not in a funny way).It's hard to imagine how they could have made such a stinker out of such a beloved cartoon."
3,Are you talking to me??,"Rocky and Bullwinkle are on thier way to New York City to stop Fearless Leader (Robert DeNiro), Boris (Jason Alexander) and Natisa (Rene Russo) from turning all of American into vegetables with RBTV! Just usual, Bullwinkle has all the great lines. This movie is filled with comedy, adventure and...more comedy!"
3,Blast from the past,Now my boy knows who Rocky and Bullwinkle are. It was nice to see an old standby updated for a new generation.
1,Wasted potential,"A movie based on Rocky & Bullwinkle could have been a really funny movie and still have been kid safe, but this was not the case. Mostly because it wasn't funny, but also because there were too many slow moments and just too many things that did not need be in the movie(do we really need to be told what a fax and e-mail are?). There were a few funny moments in the movie, most of which was acknowledging that a previous joke was bad, but the movie lack too much of the cleverness of the orignal series. Also the animated sequences are a poor attempt at recreating the TV shows animation style. The only thing that I like that really stode out was the Dudley Do-Rightish type name of Piper Perabo's character."
3,"A Bit Misleading, But Still Decent","One thing that was misleading: the cover of the DVD shows Robert De Niro, Rene Russo and Jason Alexander but those three do NOT have major roles or a lot of lines in this picture. Most of the lines are by an unknown name: actress Piper Perabo (""FBI Agent Karen Sympathy)"" and the two cartoon characters.This is another one of these live-action cartoons in which some characters are real-life and others are cartoons and the all interact on screen at once.This comedy has a lot more subtle than laugh-out-loud lines. It's decent, and does have a certain appeal but is not as good as I expected after reading a couple of reviews prior to its release. I think it has an equal appeal for kids or adults."
4,Nowhere near as bad as they'd have you believe,"While not a classic, and certainly not up the source material, the movie will still win you over with its undeniable charm. The jokes come fast and furious, Hollywood cameos abound, and Piper Perabo is simply adorable as agent Karen Sympathy. Do you NEED to own it? Probably not. but if you enjoyed the live-action ""George of the Jungle"" (and I sure did), you'll like this one too."
1,Simply Awful,"This is maybe the worst movie since ""the Invasion of the Killer Tomatoes."" It is boring and lacks any creativity. ""The Killer Tomatoes"" was much more creative and interesting.I enjoyed the original Rocky & Bullwinkle cartoons. Unfortunately, the transformation from animation to real human and animal characters does not work in this movie. The characters are real goofy and boring and simply awful. This movie does not do justice to the original cartoons. I do not see anything of what others describe as ""whimsical, funny--at times hysterical."" This is simply not true. I suggest that you save your money and buy a different movie."
1,"Is real lead balloon, Natasha. Watch old originals instead.","The TV show was fast, sharp, and funny, but the movie is slow, dull, and pointless. Fans may have a hard time reconciling the original cartoon characters with these pale carbons: Rocky, formerly the brains of the outfit, is now a forlorn wimp, and Bullwinkle, who used to fire off hilarious puns anytime and anywhere, now offers a few tired one-liners as tedious live-action characters monopolize the footage (the only bright spot is Robert DeNiro's Fearless Leader). This effort would almost certainly have worked better as a 100% animated feature. If you don't know the Rocky & Bullwinkle cartoons you might get a few laughs out of this, but you'll wonder how the show ever got such a following. Diehard fans of ""moose and squirrel"" will be disappointed. Sadly, Bill Scott (the original voice of Bullwinkle and co-creator of the TV show) does not get any screen credit at all."
5,Unrecognized Masterpiece On An Axiomatic Scale,"Rocky and Bullwinkle have been retired for a long time, but Bullwinkle has issues. His depression stems from missing the lush forest near his home. All that is left are tree stumps that have never been replanted. When they are summoned to help subdue ""Fearless Leader"" and his two associates, the mustachoed Boris and the femininely beautiful Natasha, Bullwinkle begins the healing process that he so deservedly needs for closure."
2,Not great,The only good thing I can say is I did not fall asleep while watching it. Poorly acted and directed with the question 'are the old cartoon worth changing into movies?' If this answer is movies with little to not plot and extremely poor taste here you have them.
1,Barely listenable.,"Of the many John Sinclair-""produced"" old tapes released on CD in past years, this is one of the worst. The sound quality is bad, the packaging is fair, the performances are average...you get the picture. It's difficult to listen to for a variety of reasons. There's even a warning on the CD for anyone who would take time to read it, stating this is raw material and directing newer MC5 fans away from it and to their 3 original albums. Take that advice and skip this mess."
3,meh,"I suppose if you're really new to opera, or would like to have a book around to quote definitions from this is a good book to have around, however as someone who is a step above neophyte and a (few) step(s) below expert, there are rare words in the book I couldn't give you the definition to without the book. There is a serious lack of musical terms in the book too. It's been a while since I've looked, but I don't think for instance the word portamento is in the book, which does seem like somewhat of an oversight."
5,Works fine,"It is bigger then the last filter I had on my car. This made it a little difficult to fit in the clamp, but it fit in there and works fine. Change these or check them every 20k miles!!! Otherwise you risk wearing out your fuel pump which is about $300 , time consuming to put in and could leave you stranded."
3,Texas Blues Artists Deserving Wider Recognition,"~ This CD was recorded in 1997, released in 1998, and subsequently reissued in 2010 with three bonus tracks. The 2010 reissue with bonus tracks is a better purchase because of the additional tracks by Bob Kirkpatrick. See my review ofTexas Guitar Summitfor a detailed discussion.~ I gave this CD a rating of 3-stars and the reissue a rating of 4-stars because of the additional music."
5,"""Flash"" lingers","A debut recording to be proud of, this is a wonderful album that transcends genres to make a fun, soulful, inspirational and vocally impressive listening experience. Her writing is true poetry and this girl can sing."
4,"Interesting, varied, album- worth owning","I bought this CD on a gamble and was pleased to find that it's actually pretty good. Jana has a great voice and apparently cowrote (lead credit)11 out of the 16 songs.There are four instrumentals, #1 ""Tana'ke"" has some vocals but no lyrics listed in the liner notes (for the quote the English part is based on look under the CD), several pop or pop/dance based tunes, a country tune and even a couple of songs with gospel influence.I think I especially liked #3 ""Survive the Night"", and #4 ""I'll be with you"" but for someone unknown to me Jana Mashonee seems to be a very good singer with a varied style and a lot of creativity. I don't regret buying this CD and think it is worth owning."
1,Cheap Lights & DOA,"These lights are not the highest quality. They do not compare to the Camco RV lights we bought. The plastic housings are really cheap and detail on them is poor. Really about a $1 - 2 set of lights, if they work, since ours were DOA."
4,Fiesta party lights,"Some of the cacti and sombreros keep falling off, but the price was low- so it is to be expected. They got the jb done. May not last many seasons- but that is ok"
5,Exactly as advertised,Purchased this product because my deck sits too close to my water spout and I would always have a hard time hooking and unhooking my hose. I have had no problems with it since I have owned it last year.
3,Warm and Noisy,"This heater works well. It heats consistently: turning it self on or off to keep the room we have it in warm. But, it pops and clicks and clanks and makes what sounds like dripping noises very loudly. It is so noisy I can't recommend it to anyone. I thought at first I would get used to the noise but it seems to be getting worse. Any suggestions on how to make the thing work more quietly would be appreciated."
2,Could Have Been Better...,"The book is useful only because of its historical references. I think, however, that the author goes too far in assuming the intentions of the Second Vatican Council. His interpretations are clearly biased, often presented in vague statements that border on pluralism and indifferentism. If you are looking for an objective account of the Catholic Church, try another source."
1,Bad book,"This book is like reading a history of World War II written by Mussolini. In other words, there is some accurate information, and the facts in and of themselves are usually correct. However, the bias is terrible. The title of the book is misleading, as it makes the book seem to be an unbiased historical account of the Church in the 20th century. It is, rather, one man's opinion of the Church's actions and its motives behind them, and furthermore (and this is the worst part) what the Church ought to do in the future. If you want to read an editorial with bad logic, this book is for you."
3,Slippery bottom,Looks and feels good but has an extremely slippery bottom so that needs to be fixed. Maybe a stickable sole will work??
2,Incomplete,"David Ball had three Top Ten singles, only two of which appear on this collection. Missing is ""Riding with Private Malone"" which came out in 2001 as Ball's last gasp of fame. That's not exactly the fault of this album, which was released in 2000. Still, it's no longer the comprehensive collection it set out to be."
4,David Ball Super Hits,I like David Ball's music and the honky tonk feeling I get from it. I love good old honky tonk and that is what he plays. I have several of his cd's and like all of them. Love his music.
1,Could have been better.,"Nowhere as good as the first two or three in the series. If he would have stuck to the main story and not put so much opinions, the book could have been better. For every two sentences of the story, two pages were his personal opinions that we have heard before."
1,"Doom on you, Dickie!","Arrgh, another formulae bookie, by Dickie. If the author would drop all the finger salutes and the gutter language, which slows down the plot, the stories would read much better. The way that he portrays spec ops folk, makes them all to be pyscho paranoid people. Any language has its own dignity, and the use of its lower class slang has a dimunitive effect on it. Try replacing f--k you with fornicate you. Not as much punch for the semi-literate, I guess. There are plenty of adventure novels that so not resort to constant sexual referrals! If the hero would keep his mouth as clean as his gear, it would be great..."
1,Time for retirement,"OK. Enough Dickie. The book was so boring, I did not even finish it. The only thing different from the past books is the location. Same characters, same plot, same amount of ammunition. Come on Dickie, expand your horizons some. This is comic book material. Doom on you for downplaying to your readers. At least Red Cell was believeable."
4,Designation Gold (Rogue Warrior Series),"Very good story, much better the second time I read it. That was right after reading something in the news about some terrorist getting his head blown off by a cell phone..."
5,Excellent as usual,Dick brings us another impacting novel as usual. I am a big fan of Dick's work. I am origionally from Dick's hometown which makes him all the more heroic. I look forward to many more stories. May the Legacy of The Rogue Warrior live in all of us.
5,Marcinko has written another great addition to his series.,The book that I just finished was quite entertaining and realistic although it is not my favorite from this author. The plot involves following a corrupt Israelis intelligence guy and a group of Russian Mafiya who plan to market nuclear materials to terrorists. This book is veru realistic although a bit far fetched at times but nevertheless COOOOOOL. The author has a not so subtle way of saying what he thinks that I think is refreshing because of so much sensitivity and political correctness is today's books. I would highly recommend this book to those who have enjoyed Mr. Marcinko's other books.
1,Don't waste your money,"With all the negative talk of non-stick pans I thought I'd go back to pure stainless steel. Well, it's not worth it. It had uneven heating and burned my omelette before it was done cooking inside. I think any stainless steel pan will give you the same results. That's why it's so hard to find pure stainless steel anymore. I will try the stainless steel with the aluminum core but I wanted to try the original pan from days gone by."
1,Waste of money,"I usually have good luck w/ Olympus cameras. For what we needed this seemed economical and a perfect fit. First, this camera has NO CARD SLOT. You cannot install a new card. Olympus doesn't have any information on this model number either, so don't bother calling them. They told me to ""Google it"". I ended up sending it back. Spend a little more money and get another model."
2,Didn't understand either,"The main characters did not hold my interest. Scott Phillips and Jenny Cannon where childhood friends until a tragedy pulled them apart, the death of Jenny's little brother. Years later Jenny moves back to town after being offered a job at her old elementary school where Scott is now the acting principle.Scott and Jenny where just not believable characters, I couldn't understand how they didn't have some form of contact for so many years especially since their parents had once been close friends."
2,"Uhhhh, did not understand.........","This book failed to capture and maintain my attention. I didn't get a good hold on the characters. There descriptions vague, so I couldn't picture them. I know the object of it was forgiveness, especially forgiving one's self. But the logic of holding on to something for 18yrs and blaming not only yourself but your childhood friend seemed unrealistic. Especially when the parents have been their for the children so that they could heal. Although Ms. Reeves weaved in another plot along with it, that was more interesting than this inner turmoil her female character had going on."
4,A Classic,"Even if there is only 3 mixes on this cd single, it's simply the best SONG the Propellerheads have managed to create. Bassey, of course, sells it like her life depends on it, et voila! Instant Classic! Play it for any age group: 3 generations of my family have grooved to it."
1,Lame plot,"This was an exceptionally lame offering, not up to the usual standards of a McCaffrey story. The plot has great gaping holes, and the writing in general makes it much harder to believe in the events of the story than is typical for Anne McCaffrey. Definitely not worth the cover price, no matter what the discount! Now I am wary of anything Todd McCaffrey collaborates with his mother on, if this is what he brings to a book."
1,A real disappointment,"I have been an avid ""Pern"" fan ever since publication of the very first book. Granted, not every book in the series has lived up to expectations, but none were total disappointments until now.Dragon Kin seems written for children, not for an adult audience. Hollow stickfigure characters and unbelievable action. I'm very glad I read a library copy rather than wasting my money."
2,Watchwhers can do *what*?,"I bought this book with high hopes for the continuing saga of Pern. All I can say at this point is that Todd obviously has a ""get out of canon free"" card. The characters were mildly interesting, but I found myself shaking my head over the number of times he ""Mary Sues"" the watchwhers. Part of what makes Pern, Pern, are the dragons, whers and firelizards. When the basic design and function are changed, and extra abilities are added to the unique creatures (like the whers), it makes me not want to continue reading the series.I have just about *every* Pern book out there (including the hard-to-find ""The People of Pern"") but I will not be adding any of these collaborations to my collection of Pernese gems."
3,"Fine, but definately not as magical as the others!","This was an enjoyable story about a part of life on Pern that hasn't been explored much in the other books. Nuella was by far the most interesting character, and I have hopes that she may return and gain some depth. Although it was necessary for the story, I was somewhat disappointed by the choices the authors made regarding her role.Overall, the characters just weren't as engaging as Jaxom, Robinton, and Lessa (or even F'nor or Tai, in my opinion). Part of the problem, I think, is built into the subject... mining just isn't as thrilling as the topics of many of the other books. It is also difficult for me to accept a Pern book that doesn't have a dragon & rider as a main character. I will read them all, but this is not one of the best."
3,Hmmm. . . . .could have been better,"I'm rather fond of the Pern series by Ann McCaffrey and am happy to see the story continued by her son. That said, I must say that this book does not quite live up to the same standard as his Mothers. You have a situation where tragedy strikes, a solution is presented and then....abruptly it ends on a happy note, without tying in all the little 'sub-plots' throughout the book. The storyline as well the characters need to be furthur developed and polished. Perhaps reading the original series would help. . . . . ."
3,It's OK so far,"Whilie in a bookstore the other night I saw Dragon's Kin and got very excited to see a new Pern book out. I sat down at the bookstore and began to read. The book brought me right in like every Pern novel I've read, but the dissapointing thing was when I stopped reading I checked the page number and I was already 200+ pages into the book, in an hour and a half. Most other Pern books at least take a couple days of reading it. Good book, glad to see another come out, but you may want to wait for the paperback because this one reads at about a third or fourth grade level and finishes way too quickly."
4,watch-wher,"This is the first book (at least that I know of) that has ever been devoted to a watch-wher. And I have to say, it's about time. They are the least covered of the 3 draconic types. I've always felt kind of sorry for them. And this book shows that they deserve more respect than they get. They help to save lives in their own way too. I didn't really like the ending though (even though everything really worked out for the best), this probably has to do with an established respect for the bonds between human and dragon as well as human and fire lizard. It just seemed wrong on some level for a watch-wher to be able to change that. Anyway, I would gladly reccommend this book to any McCaffrey/Pern fan."
4,Good story,"This was a good story for those who love the Pern series. The characters were well developed and the story was intriguing and interesting.There are a few disconnects, however. Nuella explains her predicament at least three times, I got it the first time. She travels all over Pern to train other watch weyrs but doesn't spend the time at home. There is a disaster at the end but the dragon and weyer leader who bring her have no part or mention in the conclusion nor is the perpetrator mentioned as to punishment or anything else. He was very obstructive before her arrival but disappears from the story at that point.Overall it is a good story that deals with miners who have not been previously talked about much."
4,Dragon's Kin,If you are a fan of Anne McCaffrey's dragon riders and want a different trip to Pern then this is a worthwhile addition to your collection. Difficult to tell the difference between the two authors.
2,Disappointing,"I love the Pern series that Anne McCaffrey has written, but the writing and plot in this book does not measure up to the original series."
5,A fan of McCaffrey & Pern,"This book is ""in the tradition"" of the great saga of Pern & it's dragons. For all of us McCaffrey fans the book/the story fills in the gap between significant events and storylines in the lives of ""dragonfolk"" and those that they protect. For fans who found the books that delt with discoveries and pioneers of ""First Landing"" in the Southern area of Pern the story is plausible and pleasing.I'm far from being a child, I am a fantasy fan who prefers not to read about odd ugly creatures(to me the dragons are odd but exempt from ""ugly"") so the stories of pern create another world that is not too bizarre to be entertaining. As a former libray assistant I got hooked because McCaffrey's books were in both the children's collection and the adult collections. I started reading to find out why. I'm hooked for life. I hope that Mom And Son persevere."
4,ok,"Anne McCaffrey is the quintessential writer of fantasy books pertaining to dragons. These books are always wonderful, well written, and perfectly characterized. All of her series are great but the ones that take place on Pern are the best of all."
3,COULD BE BETTER!,"I love Pern so the newest novel was an instant purchase. The problem with this novel is that nothing happening until the last chapters when a egg is obtained, hatched, grown, saves people from the mine and gives our adolecent hero a chance to be a Harper. Whew! I wish they hadn't postponed all the action until the end. Perhaps the authors felt the need to develop the watch-wher story before proceeding. I hope the next story clips along a bit more quickly."
3,Not up to standard set by rest of series,"The story was OK, but the McCaffrey flair for character and story development was not there. I own all the other books in this series, and many of Anne McCaffrey's other series as well, and her ability to make realistic characters that readers actually like and care about is missing from this latest effort. Reading this book was like eating cotton candy -- you know you're eating, but you're not getting anything of substance. The idea was good, but this looked like a skeleton outline of a book that needed fleshing out."
2,Too many inconsistensies!,"I did enjoy Dragon's Kin by Anne and Todd McCaffrey, but I thought that it had alot of inconsistencies.*spoilers*At one pointt in the book, Anne(or possibly Todd) tells us that whers always base their name on their handler's name, hence Kindan's wher calling herself Kisk at first and later Nuellsk when she bonds with Nuella. She also tells us that their names always end in -sk. This really irritated me because in another book(The Masterharper of Pern, I think), there is a watchwher named Burr. Did anyone else notice this? It was almost as annoying as the mixup involving Larth, Lytol's dragon."
3,Glad to be back on Pern,"I hadn't realized more books were being written about Pern so I was happy to check this one out. I thought it was pretty good. It was a little predictable, but still it was nice to be back on Pern."
1,"A ""filler"" novel","I read this book with some apprehension when I saw that Ms. McCaffrey had let her son co-author it, and the apprehension was completely justified. I think the series got so huge that she gave up on writing with any elegance or style (not that she was an amazing writer to start out with, but her teen fiction series Dragonsong, Dragonsinger, Dragondrums was very nicely executed) and just wanted to fill in the gaps in Pern's history. That's why I kept reading her novels after the first few - the world is addictive, and it's not often an author gives you such a complete picture of a universe. However, that's no excuse not to put some effort into making the stories readable. I don't care if he's her son - she should be able to tell him, ""Son, you need to learn to write."""
3,Dragon junkies will get their fix,"I've been a dragon junkie for over 30 years. (My cats have been named after Dragons & my daughter's name is Kylara). If this was your first Pern read you would not be that impressed. The writing is not up to Anne McCaffrey's normal level. The story is very good, but the vivid descriptions that grab you and take you into the story are not there. The characterization is done very well, the plot kept me interested. And you know there could possibly be more stories following this line.For Todd's first attempt it's not too bad......but it needs more color and life."
1,A waste of time,"I was EXTREMELY dissapointed by this book. I expected something similar in style to the previous books. Instead I found a book with passages that were blatant copies from previous books, and an attempt to imulate their style. It failed miserably. I realize Todd is trying to make it in tandem with his mother, but their styles are too different, and it turns out to be a miserable mix. The book doesn't keep in sequence of events. There are way too many inconsistencies and disagreements. For anyone who's been following the Dragonriders series, BEWARE!!! You'll probably be as irritated and enraged as I was. I was never more dissapointed with any other book as I was with this one."
2,A real disappointment,"I was really disappointed in this book. Unlike the other books in the Pern series, this book was written through perspective of children and seemingly for children. It was lacking any of the complexity of a book written for adults. On top of that, the first half of the book dragged with little to no action. The pace picked up in the second half but the plot of the second half seemed poorly developed. Throughout the book, the reader is continuously ""told"" what is going on and rarely allowed to ""discover"" anything new about the story or characters. This is especially true in the second half and gives the book a very shallow feeling."
1,Not quite the worst,"but definitely fighting the Dolphins of Pern for that title. There is nothing much to be done about it; it might be a nice present for children but it is lacking about everything that made books like ""The White Dragon"" so special. I guess Pern just ran out of news."
3,"A bit of a deviation, but not bad","I'll admit I'd rather read about the dragons of Pern, not the Watch Whers, but this was a decent book nonetheless."
5,A Young boy gets an unexpected challenge,"A young miner's son is musically inclined, but his home a mining community needs him to adopt a special animal to protect the mine. From there the twists are the best part."
2,Dragon's Kin,"Watch Whers are perhaps the most scorned creatures on Pern. With neither the cuteness of firelizards or the regalness and majesty of dragons, these ugly creatures are looked down upon, relegated to darkness both because they can not bear the light and because no one can stand to see them. Yet, they are essential to the survival of Pern, especially to the mining communities were this book is set. With their handlers, their relationship somewhat mirrors that of the dragonrider and dragon, but not totally. Still, the mother and son team manages to mine a story from the bond between one handler and his beast. However, none of the characters, human or otherwise, wins readers' allegiance as Lessa, Mennolly, Robinton, or F'Lar has in the past. The main point of this novel is apparently merely to return the readers to Pern, but re-reading one of the older books would suit that purpose better."
2,Disappointing,"This felt like a short story that they tried to stretch to a full novel (less than 300 pages). Really fluffy, nothing story and seem like a very rushed ending. All in all a disappointing addition. Maybe the Pern story is just mined out."
3,The Passing Torch Sputters a Bit,"I've loved Pern, her drangons and her people for years. I was thrilled that the stories would continue another generation, but Todd simply doesn't have his mother's gift for writing. The books he's writing are ok, but they aren't the free flight of Anne's books."
3,Mixed feelings,"I've read every Pern book written ever since I discovered Dragonflight, Dragonquest, and The White Dragon years and years ago. While I've enjoyed every one of them, I've liked some of them less than others and this is the case with Dragon's Kin. As compared to some of her earliest and best work, like The White Dragon, this isn't so good but it is an enjoyable story. Thankfully, the collaboration between Anne McCaffrey and her son Todd McCaffrey gets better in the later books.In ""Dragon's Kin"", we are introduced to the coal miners living in Camp Natalon near Crom. In this story, Kindan, who is important in the later books, is an orphaned miner boy, and we learn about the early days of Pern. Coal has been getting harder to find close to the surface. We also learn important details about the watch-whers which are comfortable only in dark places like mines."
3,"A Good Guide, But Know How to Sew","I was toying with the idea of making my own dress and bought this book. The author is very knowledgeable and the text is well-written. However, if you are a novice you do not want to ACTUALLY attempt a dress without either a.)guidance, or b.)other books to walk you through. This is written for those who truly understand patterns and sewing. However, if you don't sew it is a great book to understand what things you should be looking for if you are having it made by a dressmaker, and the types of fabric/necklines/veils, etc. If you're expecting a step-by-step this is not the book for you."
3,Good tricks for gown making,"This book covered the basic Palmer Pletsch pattern fitting techniques (though Fit for Real People is more thorough), and features some tricks for veils and bustling that are wedding gown specific. It would be particularly useful for making a gown for someone with fitting challenges, but it's not a great resource if you're trying to clone an engineered gown from a bridal salon. That's where ""Bridal Couture"" comes in handy."
5,Something for everyone,"This video is unbelievable! I got 2 copies one for a gift and one for me and decided to check it out. Next thing I knew I had been watching for almost 2 1/2 hours!If you are true Boston sports fan this video has it all from the Sox to the Pats and Celtics, Bruins, BC, Marathon...the list goes on. The footage is great and the way the pictures are used is cool, you get a slightly different perspective of the events you know so well and the stories that are told by the writers who covered the events are very engaging. The best part is the section on the 2004 Red Sox section which includes somethings MLB did not have (read good LCS coverage, A-rod play & more great photos).Highly recommend this encyclopedia of Boston sports."
2,It's about the writers not the players,"This DVD was disapointing to me because I wanted to see the greatest games and series of Boston's history. Instead, it interviews the reporters about where they were and what they did when the saw the Buckner play or Vinatieri's kick. I live and breathe for Boston sports and this DVD bored me."
2,Too much talk...,"If you like lots of talking and pictures, then this is the DVD for you. I was expecting much more footage and excitment, something this DVD was sorely lacking. Instead of feeling the ""goosebumps"" I was yawning. I thought this was going to be more like the DVD ""City of Champions: The Best of Boston Sports"", but it was anything but. City of Champions uses music from bands like Aerosmith and Pearl Jam to bring the moments to life. Here, they just sit there. Almost unexciting. If you want a grandfather's tale of boston sports legends, then this is for you. If you want to scream into your TV and get out of your seat and cheer, then get City of Champions. It's by far the best Sports DVD I've ever seen."
2,Don't buy this book,"This main character in this book didn't need a man as much as she needed mood stabilizers. Every other page was how she ""flew into a rage"" about a comment from her love interest. Also this book has only the slightest relationship to the Titanic. Very misleading."
5,Great shaving cream.,Great scent that's not overbearing. I prefer it to the much more expensive Trumpper's brand because this one is not so overly colored and still give a great shave.
5,Smells great,"I thought this was the soap shaving cream, but it is actually a tub of highly concentrated paste like cream. Smells wonderful!!!"
1,Lil Zane got no skills of his own,This song is horrible because this fool Lil Zane doesnt even have a style of his own so he went and jacked 2Pac's style. All he is is a Pac biter. Don't buy this garbage
1,Unreliable Seller,Don't buy from this seller. You might not get your product. Shop around for a different seller.
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,Seller isn't dependable. Didn't get the order that I placed. Be very careful when ordering from this company.
2,bummer,"First off, let me say that every other Mrs. Meyer's product I have tried has been fantastic. I purchased these thinking that they would give a lovely scent to my laundry. The cabinet in which I store them smells wonderful. However, even using 2 or 3 sheets, I can notice no significant trace of the smell on my laundry after drying. I am disappointed. I have found that when I wash a rag doused with the countertop spray, the whole load has a nice smell."
2,Newly modified version does not reduce static,"We used this for several years and loved it until they changed the sheet material. Now it's a total static nightmare. Really disappointed as we use Meyer's for almost everything. Unless they change to something that works, I wouldn't spend a $1 on it now."
5,It gets better with each listen!,"I read about Deisel Doug and the The Long Haul Truckers in Entertainment Weekly. Stephen King was giving them their props in an article about a band that should and could have made it big. He was right. They are great! The lyrics are funny, thoughtful and just plain fun. Get this honky tonkin CD, you will not be sorry.If I'D Shot Her When I Met Her (I'd Be Outta Jail By Now) 3:59I'D Like To Quit Drinkin' (But I Live Over A Bar) 2:51Not Much To Say 3:58Picture Of You 3:18Circles 4:52Never Lookin' Down 4:42Merry Christmas From The Family 4:0118 Wheels Of Love (Live) 2:40Pride'S Corner 4:11Another One Like Me 2:49An Angel Not A Saint 3:25Because Of You 4:34One Light 5:17Thin White Line 3:25Daddy'S Drinkin' Up Our Christmas 2:28My Girlfriend Is A Waitress 3:23"
5,Second Edition now available,"Be sure to check out the Second Edition of this title. It's fantastic! Search for: Body Mechanics for Manual Therapists, Second Edition."
5,A Gem,"I've been teaching massage for over 15 years, and in all that time I've never come across such a wonderful book on body mechanics. This book is a gem. As a teacher I find its content up-to-date and concise. The photos are clear, the exercises are brilliant, and the tips for students are an extra bonus. My students have learned an incredible amount from this book, and I see it in their work with each other. I wouldn't be without this book in the classroom, and my students will be so thankful for it after they graduate."
2,Its ok,"I was expecting more, new information on LMT biomechanics. While the book is well laid out, presents itself with colorful and attractive photos and diagrams, it didn't provide me with any new information. Just more of the same antiquated info taught in massage school. Disappointing."
3,Did not work,I took three capsules a day but could not see much results.I will not recommend taking this as sole supplement to reduce body fat.Some of my friends told me their energy levels improved but these are very psychological things. For me no change...
5,High quality CLA from NOW Foods,"NOW foods has long been amongst my favorites when it comes to supplements, and here again they have done it with this CLA. I have chosen to start taking this particular product for its benefits and/or abilities for the way that the body absorbs and stores fats from the foods that we eat as part of my new way of healthy eating in my attempt to lose some excess pounds.Thus far, I have indeed lost a couple of excess pounds since starting on this with no adverse effects, and have been pleased with the packaging and presentation of the product. The recommended dosage of the CLA is 3 capsules 1 or 2 times daily (your choice) 1 hour before meals, and there have been no harsh tastes, stomach upsets, etc, whatsoever to deal with while taking this supplement."
4,Works well,"I won't say that this is a miracle worker, losing weight while using it did take other work. I will say that I noticed a drastic improvement in how well my body got rid of ""excess material"". Ordered another bottle to continue taking."
2,Important but disappointing,"This film was a key element of the ""Jim Thompson revival"" of the late Eighties and Nineties, following the reissue of Thompson's novels and just preceding the great film version of The Grifters. Unfortuantely, most of the novel has vanished in the transition to the screeen. Thompson's great strengths were his ironic plots and pyrotechnic language: Greenwald's movie eliminates about half of the twelve intertwined plots that run through the book and contains very little dialogue. All the viewer is left with is a bleak and cynical tale of violence that smacks of daytime television."
4,Excellent movie,"This movie tells a sad yet heart-warming tale set in Australia in the 70's. It's a classic Aussie movie, and watching it, it's easy to see why."
2,Not the recording you're looking for...,"While the music of Machito and the Afro Cubans is excellent and mesmerizing no matter the conditions under which you encounter it, this is a poorly recorded transcription of a radio broadcast from the early 50s, featuring an annoying announcer before (and over the intro to) each song and dated and inferior sound quality.As a time capsule this album is interesting (features Zoot Sims and is recorded at Birdland during its heyday), but there are many, many FAR better recordings of the amazing music of Machito and the Afro Cubans. Seek those out and skip this one, unless you're completing a collection of Machito recordings."
2,"great voice, bad lyrics","One of the most stupid rock albums I ever bought. Other than catchy hooks on ""Everything Zen"" and ""Comedown"", the album is quite a failure, considering the poor lyrics-writing skills coming down on all the songs. Here are some examples: ""14 hairdryers swimming to you"", ""all police are paranoid, so are you--be a creature"", ""I need you more when we wanted us less""(?). All these trashy, unimagitive, unpowerful phrases are forced to come together to form so-called ""songs"" in this rock album. Not worth a penny."
3,Good But Not Original,"Most people will say that this is Bush's best album and most will agree. I do not however. This may be their most successful album with their most catchy songs but that is not necessarily a good thing. It comes at the expense at taking the sound off of pretty much every early-90's Seattle band and trying to jump-start a career with it. This is not a respectable thing. The songs themselves are good but they seem like a collection of lost Nirvana and Pearl Jam songs that you haven't heard before. With their next two albums Bush develops a more original sound and it suits them a lot better. Those are the albums that are really good, this one just isn't. However if you don't care about any of what I just said then you will most likely highly enjoy this album."
3,the grunge knock offs had a voice and some hooks,"bush i liked solely because gavin rossdale. With that british raspy voice thast was more or lessa british kurt cvorbain it worked and by listening you knew it was him not Kurt. The band may or may not have been a knock off of nirvana,but in my opinion gavin rossdale made bush sound liek themselves. The band had a decent knack for craft and delivered a handful hooky tunes on their debut. The anthemic build-release of ""comedown"" worked, ""little things"" was a nice noisey punk rock number, ""alien"" had nice a ambient semi epic touch to it. and ""glycerine"" was thier big string / guitar jam. The rest of the album sadly is middle of the road filler, the guitars ring with sloppy tuneless riffage, and gavin roissdale voice fails on him when he cant think of any hooks. while it would be almost a decade before they came up with another good album. this still remains the one that was there msot bareable"
2,dull,"Excellent songs: GlycerineGood songs: Little Things, MachineheadGeneral impression:dull, boring,not interesting; Glycerine is the only song that rises above mediocrityRating: **Conclusion: not recommended"
1,"...From the band that couldn't spell ""Shrubbery""...","This release is boring. What passes for angst is mere whining. Any hooks are few and far between. If a melody should occur, it's telegraphed well in advance by the guitars. It's sort of a musical equivalent of a dying lawn mower - there's a lot of racket but it can't cut it. Sixteen Stone is just what we didn't need more of in the mid-90s: One dimensional primitive blockhead raving. Makes a great coaster, though."
1,Dykes who hate Bush,"ZERO STARS no redeeming qualitiesI forgot about this piece of crap until it came on the radio a minute ago, and got in an argument with a coworker about when it was released. I can't believe people are still writing reviews (5-star reviews?!?!) for it, 10 years later. Save your money, it's garbage (actually, not as 'good' as Garbage), and if you must own this I'm sure you could get it in the used bin at any record store for less than a buck.This album makes me want to puke. I was going to call all of the reviewers below 12 year old boys but I see that Amazon requires you at least be 13. Which leads me to think all these reviews were written by Gavin himself. That wanker."
1,Forgot how bad this was,"Just heard one of these ""songs"" on the radio the other day. This band is no less contrived and un-listenable today than it was when they ""hit the scene"" over a decade ago. Awful lyrics, terrible musicianship, ripped off chord progressions, crass commercialism at it's most glaring. Terrible, terrible band."
3,Avearge,"Being a big Nirvana fan, I'd say Bush DOES have some of their stuff, especially the base guitar cords. Even though Bush fans try to deny it, most of Bush's music has got some Nirvana edge to it. Though 'Glycerine' is still one of my persoanl favs. And I don't think that Gavin is that great a song-writer......not if u compare him to writers like Billy Corgan(the best), Kurt and many other alternative bands around the world. But overall, the Bush boys have worked hard so let's give them some credit for that. Afterall, 16Stone has sold over 3 million copies world-wide!!!"
2,4 well crafted songs does NOT make a great cd,"Sorry folks, I hate to burst everyone's bubble - But this release is just not that good. I have listened to this off and on for about six months, waiting for most of the songs to catch on, and what I have found is that most of the cuts are to 'noise orientated' and sloppy. Songs that are plain awful are 'Bomb', 'Testosterone', 'Monkey', and 'Alien'. To much ""whining"" from the lead singer and not a mealody to be found from the guitarist ! I call this a dirty trick, figuring that this is the same group that came up with excellent songs such as 'Everything Zen' and 'Comedown'. These songs show so much craftsmanship that I would expect the same from all (or most) of the songs. It just doesn't happen ! Figuring 'Razorblade Suitcase' and 'Deconstructed' are failures for this band - I think we will be seeing them in a few years on VH1's WHERE ARE THEY NOW segments."
1,Haven't We Heard This Before?,"The biggest problem with this album is not the meaningless lyrics, nor the uninspired vocals of Gavin Rossdale. Nope, the biggest problem is the lack of originality and creativity exhibited in a majority of the tunes on Sixteen Stone. We've heard this guitary, angst-ridden slop before, and it's at its worst here. Playing loudly is not a substitute for playing well, and, unfortunately, Bush does not seem to realize this. It's music your local garage band could reproduce quite easily. The most disturbing thing about Sixteen Stone,however, is the way the lyrics feign depth through a series of non-sensical lines. I would say it's a shame for all this talent to go to waste but..."
5,THis is the greatest CD Bush has made yet,"this is one of the greatest CD's ever, with Bush coming out with in my opinion their greatest CD. Although all Bush cd's are great, this one u should buy!!!!!!!"
5,Coolest cd ever,This is the coolest cd ever put out by Bush! I haven't found a better cd in this type of music so far.
3,Not a bad album,"The only reason I bought this cd is because my girlfriend made a cd for me with the song MACHINEHEAD on it, and I liked the song. I never really gave BUSH a real listen to, but this album is pretty darn good. The singer has a pretty good voice, and musically the band sounds pretty tight. SIXTEEN STONE is a good modern rock album and I can say that buying it has not been a bad choice for me. Besides MACHINEHEAD, some other songs on this album that I think are good are EVERYTHING ZEN, LITTLE THINGS, COMEDOWN, TESTOSTERONE, GLYCERINE. This album is a breath of fresh air compared to some of the junk that is popular today. While they might win points for being original on this album, they are still good at what they do. So I think that this album will be a cool addition to your collection. I would actually give it 3 1/2 stars."
3,"Impressive first album, not a great one though.","But their are some killer tunes on here that will just blow your head off.Best ones? ""Everything Zen"" ""Little Things"" ""Comedown"""
4,ahh....the days of 7th grade,"this cd takes me back. back to the days of antioch middle school. oh, the good times. sitting im my room listening to this cd. i think that this cd changed my life. i know, i know. how the heck can some stupid wanna nirvana band change the life of someone? well, lets just say i was young. young and in love. oh wait..different story. anyway..this album was a life changing expereince, simply cause i got to look cool by putting a bush sticker on my notebook. i was such the cool kid. me and my jnco pants. anyway...the cd is actually OK. even if you aren't in middle school. decent rock tunes that will get you singing along, or someting."
5,Excellent album.,"This is easily Bush's best album by far, the sonics take this album to a new level for Bush and its a stonger listen than any of their first three, every track delivers pretty much and back in 2001 it got no airplay hardly at all, despite ""Inflatable"" being another more radio friendly and much better song than anything other on the radio at that time.Get It!!"
3,Agh...,"I can't decide what to think of this. As many others have already said, Bush is a damn dirty Nirvana cover band, their latest album being no exception. But their songs are just so catchy, ""Glycerine"" and ""Machinehead"" (both of which have been rotated to hell and back on commerical rock stations around the continent) especially. If I could use the phrase ""hurts so good"" to describe one thing, you can bet that it would be Sixteen Stone. Overall, I'd say it isn't that bad a way to drop 14 bucks if you're into grunge and don't mind crappy lyrics and imitation almost to the brink of plagarism."
3,"Gavin, Gavin, Gavin.","Sixteen Stone by Bush was a average album and some of the tracks are still catchy to this day such as: Machinehead, Glycerine, Everything Zen, Swim, Monkey, and Comedown. Bush wasn't a band that had staying power but the 90s wouldn't have been the same without that handsome face, Gavin Rossdale."
1,"""Everything"" is your fault Gavin...","I blame everything on BUSH for destroying good music and paving the way for all the fake, untalented, unimaginative, low-frequency bands that would generate hence forth after 1994. You are guilty Gavin and for this you are a shameless counterfeit musician. YOu know, people are always knocking the 80's saying how shallow it was...well....what's the difference between the current rock scene now and of the 80's? They both suck.Long live NIRVANA, ZEPPELIN & HENDRIX."
3,Listen here!!!!,"I know alot of you say that Bush is just a copy cat grunge band trying to sound like [other bands] and that there's nothing that you haven't already heard on this record. I tend to agree with you but what makes this album so desireable is the the togertherness or tightness of the band. Every groove, every riff every beat is so well orchestrated and fits in perfectly at exactly the right time that you do at least get a kick out of hearing it. I won't lie to you I don't listen to this record that much anymore, since discovering greater talent such as TooL and Kyuss (to name a few) but it isin't such a bad album after all though it is simple."
5,THIS ALBUM ROCKS!,"I love 16stone! It's my favorite BUSH album! (I like razorblade suiutcase, but this one I think rocks more!)....nothing beats this album........the reason I'm reviewing this album, is cause I wanna tip the star scale...I hope it works...BECAUSE THIS ALBUM IS #1!"
3,What? 5 times platinum?,"It's a great CD, but 5x platinum is a bit too much for it. Good guitars, and adaquate vocals."
4,Great CD,"A great album, good to listen to with a variety of rock stylings. I was impressed by their sound and power."
5,THIS IS THE BEST CD EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!!,"I LOVE THIS CD. PLUS BUSH IS MY FAVORITE BAND IN THE WHOLE WORLD.EVERY SONG IS GOOD AND HAS MEANING IN EVERY WORD. I LIKE RAZORBLADE SUITCASE, BUT THIS CD CANNOT BE TOPPED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Gets better every time I listen to it,"Really, it does. Clean, memorable melodies. This is really all I ask for. And here's the interesting part... they're here throughout most of this CD. Go figure."
5,not a nirvana rip off,"they say that Bush is a lot like Nirvana. I think not. Thats an insult to both bands. Nirvana cannot be compared to anything. And Bush is more upbeat than Nirvana ever was.Everything Zen - is one that most know. It still to this day gets often radio play. a good start to the album.Little Things - One of the best tracks by Bush, this gets a lot of air play still. one highlight of this album.Comedown - of course this one is a great track. It just flows and i don't know too many people that don't like it.Machinehead - the most recognizable Bush song. This is jsut one of those songs that sticks in your mind a long time. A good song. A little overrated considering the rest of the album.Glycerine - a good slow track. One of their more popular tracks. A good one. Worth the time.A decent album. I give it a five b/c its their best album to date. Usually teh first one is. The others get a little bad. their recent one thoguh is good, ""Golden State"" is a good record.recommendedpeace"
1,This CD signaled the beginning of the end for alternative,It's bands like this that took alt-rock from being important to being superficial and irrelevant.
1,crap.....,"Ever see that star trek episode where Jim and Spock have to fight to the death with those neat pole axe type things? Well I would like to have myself and (pretty boy) Gavin have the same type of scenario. I really think this band sucks, I mean to jump on a bandwagon as it's already fading is so weak.... but hey so are they.....p.s what's with the name ""bush"" are they trying to be clever???? my message to bush... not happening ladies...."
1,Save your money.,"I listened to this album as a favor to a friend. It was horrible. I'm just thankful that I was washing dishes when I listened to it, because at least I was doing something useful at the time."
1,Boycott Bush (take that anyway you want)!,Why did a band with so any decent singles yet so many pathetic non-singles have to name itself after such an incompetent president? Maybe because Gavin is such an incopetent guitarist. Boycott Bush (take that anyway you want to)!
1,What if Nirvana sucked?,"For anyone who ever lay awake at night contemplating the above question, this CD provides the answer."
5,One of the best bands of all time.,"This probably their best album, has some mega mega songs on it, the guitars a raw edgy and just blow you off your seat.Brilliant debut record as well, just awesome."
3,I can still listen to it now & then....,"I used to be a really big fan of Bush, but sooner or later I just kind of lost interest and found that they get kind of dull after a while... however, recently my cousin had a bunch of cds he didn't want anymore, and this was one of them,, and I took it.. I can still listen to this cd now & then- ""Everything Zen"" & ""Comedown"" are 90s alternative rock classics, as are ""Little Things"" and ""Machine Head""- thats pretty much all that the album is worth though... other than that, well that's why I don't really like Bush anymore..."
3,"Some Good, Some...well...","Bush, on their first commercial release, showed they had the chops and the wherewithal to make some good alternative noise. The band plays well, and even if the lyrics tend towards the obtuse (""Everything Zen""? I don't think so), Gavin can sing them well enough that it doesn't really matter. Unfortunately, the album is rather hit and miss in all the parts coming together. Some songs don't make much impression even after several listens (""Bomb"", ""Body""), and some have lyrics that are silly enough to intrude (""Machinehead""). However, when it all works, it's quite good - ""Comedown"" is my favorite here, along with ""Alien"", ""Glycerine"" and the silly short ""X-Girlfriend"". Pick it up if you like this sort of thing."
1,"Millions buy boring, uninspired record!","What a piece of crap! Completely copying Nirvana and any other ""grunge"" band that happened to be popular at the time, Bush add some pseudo-intellectual lyrics and assume they have come up with ""art."" Well, let me tell you something boys, ""art"" is the result of hard work, effort, talent, and a desire to create something that lasts. Instead, this band hopes that selling millions of records to Americans hungry for ""the next big thing"" will justify their presence in the music world. Hopefully, this band will soon be working at a gas station next to Milli Vanilli, A Flock of Seagulls, Vanilla Ice, and the countless other groups who thought they had what it takes to make it in the music industry. While real bands like Sonic Youth will continue to do what they love for a living, making art and inspiring hundreds of thousands of people."
4,"Good, but I was a bit dissapointed","Good, but I was alittle disapointed I bought this CD expecting it to be the best CD I have ever gotten, but it is only amongst my top 10. Don't get me wrong, it was worth the money, I just wouldn't get my hopes too high if you buy it..."
5,Ryan's Review,"Bush's first and best album, ""Sixteen Stone"", is a blend of heavy music to quiet and calm. Bush though is not an average band. Like Nirvana, and Fear Factory (which are great bands too.) their music sounds like they are just screaming out the lyrics, but with Bush's music you can feel and picture what the band is playing.(ex. Glycerine- heart break. Comedown- he has achevied so much but something or someone let him down.) Think about what I said when listening to the music and I garentee that you will feel something too."
4,Pretty good debut CD,"Yeah Bush does have some music sounding alot like Nirvana but there are alot of differences. I still recommend this CD. Huge hits like Everything Zen, Little Things and Machinehead make this album worth a try. Unlike Nirvana this Cd holds some good soft songs. I think this CD sounds more like Pearl Jams music. So if you like Pearl Jam i recommend this."
5,arguably one of the best albums of the decade,"This is surely a masterpiece - art at its finest. The best song is ""Alien"". It is perhaps one of the best songs ever written, as it is more than just a song, but actually an experience. It makes you feel fulfilled. Then there is Monkey and Comedown and Glycerine and Little Things and a whole heap of other bitesize experiences. This is an excellent album and Bush will never beat it - if they do, then they will surely grab the world's attention once again."
2,Very thin and low quality. Broke second day.,Not for anything but very dainty type of use. Maybe delicate desk work only. Do not travel with this anywhere as the slightest thing will break these templates.
5,A surprise,This is a surprisingly solid piece of furniture. I had assumed that the top would be more like a lid piece that fit snugly onto a base. Instead it was a hinged piece and the hinges were substantial. The inside wasn't as deep as I'd hoped; it's perfect for blankets and a board game or two but you can't hoard stuff in there. If you buy the sofa that this goes with I recommend you buy two of these.
3,Leather Ottoman,"The ottoman is OK, but I would not purchase it if I had seen it in person. Delivery was very prompt.On delivery, I took the ottoman out of the packing and inspected for any damage. It was good. After the delivery man had gone, I opened the lid of the item (it's a storage unit ottoman), and one of the hinges was not even connected at one end, so the top wouldn't close and it just flopped to the side. This would have been an assembly error, not a delivery issue. My husband fixed that, but I wonder if we will have trouble in the future with it.The item is heavy and cumbersome when I'm vacuuming. My husband has removed the legs and installed casters on the bottom so it can move with ease."
3,Not five stars but OK,"I offer three stars for this movie to balance, in a sense, the straight five-star run it seems to have had so far from ... reviewers. It is a nice film but not too gripping, a reasonable evening's entertainment that is neither too gory nor terminally boring. And the cinematography/photography IS a treat.The Mormon religion figures highly in this film in a respectful, sympathetic fashion. I suspect, but of course could not prove, that the film's five-star review run stems from people of the Mormon persuasion who liked what they saw and want to get the word out. To a non-Mormon such as I, Mormon Brigham City as depicted herein came across as a reasonably benevolent yet rather pervasively suffocating religious city-state. And they are all so clean-cut! Would that real life were so.Too bad Wilford Brimley is offed by the killer about two-thirds through the movie. I would have liked to see him go the distance.Bottom line: an OK story OK done but not five stars."
1,Frightening fascism,"This film (unintentionally, to be sure) presents one of the best arguments for separation of church and state that I've ever seen on film. I am amazed that no one else writing reviews seems to have been disturbed by the film's ""hero,"" a small-town sheriff who is also a Mormon bishop, sending out church elders--not deputized and without warrants--on a search of the interior of people's houses. The film seems to not only countenance, but espouse, egregious violation of the U.S. constitution's guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure. If this represents Mormon-ism, then there is much for citizens to fear from its practitioners."
3,I'm not sure,"I thought it was an OK movie, but a little weird for an LDS film. The ended was shocking but then made you feel good. I wouldn't watch it with kids, but it's a good one."
3,Makes you think.,"Substandard by the best movies coming out of Hollywood, but still worth watching. Just think about it as you watch. This one isn't for stupidly sitting there wanting to be entertained: it asks you to think. And then it climbs above most Hollywood products. This is a really good ""who-done-it."""
4,Quirky film yielded good things,"At first glance, I had zero interest in seeing the film until a friend recommended it to me. Hey, since there'll be food at her place, I said yes. I really liked it! It had me going to the end! Albeit, not everyone will entirely understand the internal working of a small Moromon community but I thought the director gave us a good idea of it! And lets face it, it doesn't need to be a Mormon town--it's like any small town with its quirks, and dynamics, where everyone wears many hats! I liked the fact that I recognized no one save Wilford Brimly. Very refreshing! The sheriff/Bishop is a little low-keyed but hey, he's a widower with a murder on his hands. All-in-all a great 'indie' movie by director/writer/actor Dutcher--a one-man-show. I'm buying this one for Christmas!"
3,Brigham City,"Brigham City, a much anticipated and acclaimed independent film, truly appealed to my inner detective, being at once dark and film noirish and presenting a view of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints' process of repentance and forgiveness. The completely unexpected plot twist was certainly a bonus. This film is great for families and the future of Richard Dutcher as an actor, writer and producer is more solid than ever with the release of this great film."
5,English,The book was exactly what I needed for my class and I'm happy to say that it was in great condition and I would definitely buy again from this user.
4,Applications of People Types and Tiger Stripes,This book is an excellent resource for classroom teachers who want ways to apply the concept of personality types to their instructional planning. It contains a quick and dirty survey for students use that identifies 4 out of the 8 preferences of the Myers Briggs Type Indicator. I have found it extremely useful in my work with pre-service and in-service teachers.
1,Not Great Nappy Brown,"This cd was a good idea, but it just doesnt work... Simply put, bad performance bad production, dont waist your time on this, its boring.... there is much better Nappy Brown out there... Not Recommended!!!!!"
1,thinking this is a good record is just flat-out denial,this record is so bad it almost makes you long for the laurence archer years. i am a longtime ufo/schenker fanatic and was shocked to hear how lame this record is. all of the negative reviews here are accurate and the ufo/schenker legacy has been desecrated with this rushed release. all of my ufo loving buddies completely agree.this review is the safest way i could think of to let out my anger.
4,Great CD,"I read a negative review of this CD elsewhere but being a huge UFO fan I was going to purchase it anyway. I put it on expecting the worst and it never came! I like it even better than Walk on Water. It's catchy, it's Schenker, it's Moog, it's UFO for crying out loud! I liked every song and some stayed in my head. Of course, I was listening through headphones. But really, if you are a fan of UFO or this genre of music you can purchase this without hesitation."
4,They're Back!,"One of the greatest hard rock bands of the '70s and '80s is back with its classic lineup (Michael Schenker-guitar, Phil Mogg-vocals, Pete Way-bass). And UFO is back with a vengence. Covenant is a two CD set. The first being 11 new studio tracks. Schenker's guitar is flawless and soars on tracks like ""Unraveled"" and ""Fool's Gold"". The sound is a bit rawer than most UFO albums, but still manages to capture both the power and melody that is UFO. The second CD has 7 live tracks from their '95 US tour. 5 classic UFO tracks plus two from their underated Walk on Water album. Covenant isn't Strangers in the Night or Lights Out but it is a good buy."
3,"Good,but not great like W.O.W.","I just got Covenant yesterday(7-28) and have listened to it all the way through 3 times now.I guess because I was so blown away by 'Walk on Water' that this disc is somewhat of a let down.The first song(Love is Forever)and the third track(Miss the Lights) are my favorite songs on the disc.Like another reviewer said,if THIS disc was their reunion disc and not W.O.W..I would be more impressed,as it is it's a very enjoyable 48 minutes of hard rock but it leaves one wondering where is the fire and passion from W.O.W.? I'm a big fan of UFO since their 1st lps 'Flying' and 'One' and and I would rate this release as somewhere between 'Force It'and Mechanix' as my fav. UFO albums.(top 5 being..Lights Out,Obsession,W.O.W.,No Heavy Petting and Phenomenon.It's still worth the money tho because of the bonus live disc which has 'Love to Love' on it which happens to be my all-time favorite song by ANY band."
4,Classic rock....never fades away !!!,"I just want to say that no matter what style of music becomes popular(grunge, hiphop,thrash,etc...) good old rock and roll is always there to stay!!! While this album from UFO is not one of their best, it rocks harder than most of the stuff out there today. You can hum to the melodies unlike new music nowadays. This cd is more harder edged than most UFO cds but still great for UFO fans. I think that they seem to get along better than in their heyday of the late 70's and for that reason this album stands up to most fans wishes. It's been 5 years since Walk on Water and 22 years since Strangers in the Night but they stiil rock with no end in sight. Can you see Korn or Limp Bizkit rocking 25 years from now? I don't think so!!!"
3,"Ufo, Covenant","I only gave this 3 stars becasue of Schenkers lead work. The production is dated and Phil Mogg's vocals are annoying. I can't speak for all UFO fans, but I want to hear songs like Space Child and Queen of the Deep. I want to hear Just another Suicide. Walk on Water is one of the best sounding albums I've ever heard. When I heard the production on Covenant I was very disappointed. It is the year 2000. I don't want to hear something that sounds like it was recorded in 1982. These guys have made some of the most amazing music in the history of rock. But not on this album. When they SIT DOWN and write their next album, it will be a classic."
3,Schenker should stay solo,"Walk On Water wasn't a bad reunion effort; but, Michael Schenker has been prolific of late in his solo career. His last several releases show his incredible virtuosity and drastic improvement in songwriting. This UFO effort seems a little tired...perhaps because Phil is. It's a musically average album. Disc 2 has live versions of older hits...most of which appeaer on The Michael Schenker Story Live (where they are done to perfection) and even these lack the punch they've had in the past. I'd go see this line up live but mostly out of respect for past excellence."
2,COmparison are unavoidable...,"The problem with this album is that we cannot avoid comparing it to the far superior WLAK ON WATER, written back in 1995. Also, Andy PArker and Paul Raymond are not on board. Thismake a llthe difference in the world, when you add to it the fact that the songs are simply inferior."
2,SAD ...,"IT's sad to see an UFO album in which the opener tune has the title of ""LOVE IS FOREVER""... This is more in style with the sad phase that marked the decline of the group when Schenker left and also in the lousy phase of Schenker's solo career, whe he joined forces with the awful Robin McAuley ... Anyway, UFO tries to survie, but forget it. THey'll never be even the shade of themselves again..."
1,UFO low point,This has to be one of the very worst cds the band has put out since 1974 when Mr. Schenker joined the band. I worship Micheal and Phil for their respective talents over the years but to praise this very boring set is well beyond reason.
1,Better luck 15 years ago,"Alas, UFO is the victim of faded glory. ""Covenant"" may well prove to be one of the most egregious and half-hearted attempts (and a majorly lame one at that) of a once great rock band to save its members from total obscurity as the years roll by. File this one under, ""Either put out next time or retire gracefully."" Caveat emptor: serious UFO fans that know anything about anything should forego the ""Covenant"" CD in lieu of insomnia over what used to be. As an aside, and for those of you that need a taste of contemporary UFO (as opposed to, but necessarily in contradiction of ""classic"" UFO), check out ""The Wild, the Willing, and the Innocent."" Despite the absence of Michael Schenker, this album is worthy of Friday night contests with neighbors residing between thin walls about who can out-crank the other. In short, ""Covenant"" doesn't cut it by a long shot. And that's the brutal truth."
2,OFF THE MARK,"THE ONLY WAY I CAN SAY IT IS THIS CD FLAT OUT BLOWS.AFTER THE FINE WALK ON WATER CD,I JUST DON`T SEE HOW THEY COULD PUT OUT THIS...EVERYTHING IS OFF ON THIS MAMMOTH DISSAPOINTMENT.I CAN NOT BELIEVE MIKE SCHENKERS GUITAR WORK,OR SHOULD I SAY LACK OF GUITAR WORK.WHERE ARE ALL OF THE BRILLIANT SOLOS THAT WE ARE SO USED TO FROM UFO.THE VOCALS BY PHIL MOGG ARE ALSO A MESS.IF YOU ARE A BIG UFO FAN,STAY AWAY FROM THIS BLOODY TRIPE.THE NEW CD SHARKS IS MUCH BETTER THAN THIS."
2,This cd just lacks something,"Well, I don't know what else to say except the maybe they were trying to do too many cd's in too short of space of time. Mogg/way choclate box is a very good cd and so is schkener's adventures of the imagination but this doesn't quite get there."
1,Thank you UFO fans,"I just want to thank all the true UFO fans who sent in these negative reviews. As a total UFO freak I was at a fever pitch for this box set, since I was blown away by how excellent ""Walk on Water"" was. The sound quality and song writing on that album is seriously ranked w/ the best UFO ever did. I came on amazon to order my copy of Covenant, but after reading what was said will not buy (no Andy Parker?......forget that!). I was totally bummed to read the reviews but they were obviously written by people who know their UFO and will not accept a substandard product. Get ""Walk on Water""!"
5,Fun game.,"this CD is great,and fun game to enjoy your time,fun game that you can share with your family and friends."
5,Wonderfull and pleasant game!!,"I have this game at home and this is a game I took from my little nefew, he wanted me to try it, I told him at first, this is for kids, but let me tell you this is not just for kids, the more you play the more you want to play, it a patience game but let me tell you, each time you say I will only be on it for 1 hour, you never quit after that, you do not see the time go buy, it goes by so fast. In my opinion, this is a wonderful and pleasant game. do not hesitate to buy."
4,IT's actually PRetty GoOD,"THe movie didn't start off that interesting but after about fifteen minutes I began to get interested. Although the movie is a bit cheesy, I enjoy a bit of cheese now and then. It's just another I love my family I hate my family type of movie."
2,A bird's eye view -- at best,"To me, this book seems to have been written from a great distance. When are caucasian writers going to stop calling themselves ""bold"" and ""daring"" when they ""lift the curtain"" on Chinatown? Stop all the self-congratulation. This is a book written from the point of view of an OUTSIDER, which is okay, but let's call it what it is. Read ""The New Chinatown"" by Peter Kwong or ""Born to Kill"" by T.J. English, both books about the Asian community written with compassion and understanding."
3,Sometimes confusing but entertaining,"I live near New York's Chinatown and walk through it almost daily. I'm intrigued by the subject of a society that IS very much closed from the rest of America.This book answers a lot of my questions and is very entertaining and informative; however, it obviously went through several re-writes. Some paragraphs seem stuffed in without any rhyme or reason to them. Confusing. Sentences don't connect with each other.I hope this book is reprinted with more-recent facts."
1,Instructions are unclear,"We just got this notebook stand but we were not able to open it. The instructions have no written words, only pictures. The stand was supposed to open like a book but it does not. We tried every movement and nothing and there is nothing in the web site either. Maybe one of you, guys, could help? :)"
4,Thank you!!,"I was given your book ""Amazing Cat Stories"" as a gift and absolutely loved it! I wanted to thank you for your wonderful talents and allowing me to go back in time. I had to send my ""Buddy"" to kitty heaven this past August and I can honestly say that was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. After 15 1/2 wonderful years of companionship I felt lost without her. After reading your book, so many great memories came flooding back to me. I would defintely recommend this book to any animal lover or for that matter anyone with a heart! Thank you and keep up the great work!!"
5,A must for any serious flamenco fan,"The recording itself has a lot of noise and its dynamic range is quite limited. All this is quickly forgotten as the music takes you on an emotionas ride. If you love flamenco, you must listen to The Grand Master Sabicas."
3,Another deadly season in Milwaukee,"Beth Hartley now thinks that sleuthing is her new hobby. Her homicide detective boyfriend seems to be jealous of her skills. So, when a new murder of a law school buddy seems to just fall in her lap, he gets angry. This murdererseems to be following her wherever she goes and sends threatening letters with the pictures of her going about her investigation and her normal life. Now that the situation is getting personal, she is afraid of what will happen if she doesn't solve the murder.The mystery angle of this story is pretty good, although I find Beth Hartly annoying. I can understand why the detective is always angry. This is a quick read but there isn't that much to it."
5,It's About Time,"It's about time that someone brought together the illest emcees and introduced them to the world. Rawkus has an established reputation among underground heads as the best and most reliable label around, and it's nice to see both the label and the artists receiving the respect and recognition they deserve. Props to everyone at Rawkus, all the artists involved, Ecko Unlimited, and especially Anthony Marshall and Danny Castro - the founders of the Lyricist Lounge."
4,rare survival soundz production,This albulm is a must have in that it captures a classic era in NYC Hip-Hop. I would say Saul Williams 'OHM' and Talib Kwali's 'manifesto' is reason enough to cop this CD. The second CD is hosted by Menalick and kool keith with brilliant Survival Soundz providing the soundscape..
4,Solid (but there's too much talking),"I'm sorry, but it has to be said. The first time listening to this album is supposed to give the impression that you're really at the Lyricist Lounge. But after every song ending with an applause and two minutes of talking by the hosts, I felt like saying, ""Get on with the show!"" I feel like if all of the interludes (and poetry) were cut out, then it would have been a solid single album instead of a double album. If you're like me and just want a strictly rap album, this may not be for you. But for everyone else, buy it. It has good joints by Kweli, Punch and Words, and a host of others (my favorite joint is ""Keep Pourin'"")."
4,Solid golden-era Rawkus release,"I'm amazed only two other people have written a review of this album. I bought it a few months ago and I remember all the good times. A nice collab with OC and Ras Kass, and some impressive cyphers with a vicious beat from William Tell. 88 Keys, Ge-ology, Shawn J. Period, and Hi-Tek all add some dope beats as well. A classic song in The Manifesto where Kweli breaks down the composition of the culture. 8.6/10 for a good B, solid beats and rhymes."
5,Great job Rawkus,"When i first listened to this cd i was blown away it has great beats and the lyrics are off the hook! Rawkus did a great job making this cd they bring in a mix of underground and mainstream musicians. With the classic Rawkus crew Mos Def and Talib Kweli and DJ Hi Tek as Reflection Eternal, Skillz and Pharoahe Monch. They also throw in a of the hook freestyle. But by far the song that i enjoyed the most was A.L. Lyrics on the second disc, i have never heard of him before and he just came out with some of the best lyrics i have ever heard he flows to the beat and he makes great ryhmes that blew me away i have been tryin yo find more from him but i cant find a thing he has to come up with something else. Overall i highly recommend this album, its another hit from Rawkus the number one record lable in my mindTALIB KWELI & DJ HI TEK (REFLECTION ETERNAL)MOS DEFPHAROAHE MONCHSKILLZNOVEL"
4,Web TV Plus,"Sending e-mail is very simple and quick. It's also a quick way to check sports scores, stocks, weather, etc.Surfing the web can be a strain on the eyes. It's better to use a computer for detailed internet surfing. It's nice to be able to use your own ISP through WebTV and save $10 per month.The wireless keyboard is the only way to go!"
3,"Comes with ""everything""","I ordered this as a gift for my brother because it says it comes with everything and the price is great. Unfortunately, ""everything"" does not mean what it implies. The keyboard is not included so now I have to order a keyboard for him which will come later."
1,WEBTV.PLUS,"it worked for about 3 months, was working when i pluged in the electronic eye, power shut off, unplugged electronic eye, and have never been able to get it to turn on again. not dropped, or abused in anyway, port for electronic eye very visable, no problem plugging it in, than no power. took electronic eye off, and never has had power again. i'm using an old classic that my mom gave me. so limiting. but better than nothing. keyboard that i bought seperately through beverley roake did same thing. put in batteries, most keys work, next day dead.what a bargin ! we live on disability and we can't just go out and buy a new one. ..."
3,Order webtv plus mat976a1 ..got webtv mat960a101,"got the product quickly. it was a different webtv model than picture.Webtv is just a backup for the backup. order was for a phil.mag. webtv plus mat976a1, recieved phil. mag. webtv mat960a101"
2,for kids and perhaps the elderly,"want to email, how about chit chat, watch TV (pip), then buy this unit. Want to write a letter, download ANYTHING etc. etc. then buy a computer for $.... I`ve owned this exact unit now for 6 years and over time its become very unrealiable. Can`t access ALL webpages, (some you can`t even read ) disconnects frequently and is so slow. The only good thing about it is its very easy to navigate, thats why I would recommend it for the elderly. Maybe the kids, but to be computer literate in this computer world, you`re better off buying them a computer so they can learn the right way. NO CHOICE for a cheaper ISP"
1,UNACCEPTABLE - ONE STAR MINUS,"NO POWER, MINOR BUT I CAN'T FIX IT.UNIT ONLY, NO CABLES OR WIRES. DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS YOU OWN A SCREWDRIVER AND KNOW HOW TO USE IT. POWER WENT OUT WHEN THE WEB EYE WAS PLUGGED IN FOR THE SECOND TIME. WHEN I BOUGHT IT, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN LIKE NEW CONDITION. ALTHOUGH, IT DOES LOOKS LIKE IT."
5,Better than Sony W100 and PhilipsMagnavox MAT965,"I love WEB/MSN tv.Give it back to Bill Gates and Microsoft.There,i said my peice on that subject.Anyone know where i can get an IR Blaster for it?Where is my two cents for my thoughts?"
1,Buyer Beware,Ever since Microsoft purchased Webtv the service has gone straight down hill. Buy a cheap computur and save yourself the frustrations of trying to surf the internet. Also the 24.95 monthly service fee is outrages since you don't even have Java Script.
2,My review: Webtv Plus,"I have never been so frustrated with a piece of electronic equipment in my life. For the price difference between 'classic' and 'plus', you would kinda think that you might get more than just a freaking freeze frame. At this rate, by the time webtv comes out with more pieces of 'better and better' stuff, (like a harddrive, or maybe something that does not give...""this site has info that is not compatible with...""), the thing will cost $6000. And, not to mention the monthly access charge, which will(by then) run about $489.95."
5,A Gift from the Gods!,"I love this machine - my WebTV Plus is wonderful, works perfectly, no problems with anything. I had the Sony Classic before this and it is still going full blast in my Sis's home. You never get a virus, you move around anywhere you want to go and it has saved my legs in shopping on line. I am furious that they are discontinuing it and what is with the price gouging on the used ones? They ARE more expensive than mine was new. If you can find one - buy it fast for a backup."
5,Webtv Plus,i think it's great! for getting on the web pretty fast i couldn't live without it..it's alot better then a computerit's by far better to surf the net with :)
5,Encouraging and practical - a must read!,"This is the most encouraging and practical book I have read on sharing the Good News of Jesus Christ. It showed me how to make the Great Commission a do-able, natural, part of my life - something that simply flows from my relationships with others. This book is a must-read for those who want to make an eternal impact in the lives of those around them."
2,very dissapointing,"i bought this book because of its two great authors but when i got it i found that other than the finished product all pictures are B&W; which is a shame when doing a book on polymer clay which is such a colorful medium.in addition, most of Barbara's projects shown in this books are projects that i have from her other (very good) book ""stamping with clay"""
2,Needs more color,"The book gives you a rundown of what kinds of clays there are, what tools to use, and walks you through various craft projects. Though there's pictures for just about every step, they're all in black and white. The pictures don't really do much for such a colorful medium like polymer clay.The table of contents doesn't reveal much about the book's contents. Chapter titles like Sentimental Circle, Bangle Beauty, Cute as a Button, and Crazy Daisy are cute enough, but you have to browse through the book to find out exactly what all these things are. Browsing would be more fun if the pictures were all in color.There's not that much focus on technique and how to make your own unique projects. It's mostly about how to make various objects in a very specific way (a starry clock, a haunted candle, etc.), though I suppose there's nothing to stop anyone from tweaking the projects and taking away ideas or tips that can be reused.Overall, it's not a book I'd recommend."
2,It should be in color,"This was such a disappointment. I expect to see a lot of color in an art illustrated book, but it is almost entirely black & white. It really takes away from the integrity of this book.I have other books by both of these authors, and the others a beautifully illustrated.This was not a good idea."
2,Soft metal is not a good choice for a screwdriver,"Given the price, I probably shouldn't be surprised - but these things don't hold up worth a darn. If you're trying to move a very small screw that's being stubborn, be careful - it's easy to damage the tips of these drivers.If you want a cheap set to just have around, just in case, these probably are a decent purchase. But don't expect them to last."
3,A lot of screwdrivers for the price,"I bought these a few months ago and have used them several times. For the price they seem to be of a decent quality. The biggest drawback is the case, the screwdrivers fell out of case and were all over the shipping box. One driver came up missing. They also fall out every time you try to move the case because of the cheap plastic. but you get what you pay for and overall the drivers are ok."
2,Beautiful and professionally written book,"I bought the book and read it thoroughly, word for word. The perfect revovery book for someone in need. The issue is who actually wrote the book.For anyone knowing this individual well, it is quiet obvious that very little of the book's content was actually composed by the author.But professionallly done, I must say."
1,Clean,I bought this book for my son when he was toying with drugs. I'd seen a presentation of the book and author on Good Morning America and thought it might provide some personal insights for my teenage son. I don't think he found it helpful and neither did I.
4,What I expected,This is exactly what I expected from the set. It was great to see these old movies again. Thanks you.
3,Boughtt as gift for granddaughter...,"Gave my granddaughter for Christmas a Shirley Temple package (collectible doll, DVD and Shirley Temple paper doll book) Unfortunatelly, she lives far away and I cannot show her how wonderful Shirley Temple and her memories are. To date, I don't believe she has viewed the DVD/movies."
3,damaged DVD,"One DVD skips so much it can't be viewed. The cover of ""Dimples"" had a yellow round circle sticky attached (the others had no sticker). Wonder if that meant it was damaged and was sent as an oversite. Other 2 DVDs were fine."
5,kids,Bought the DVD Set one to three for granddaughters they are enjoying them after Christmas plan on getting more thanks
4,True to form goodness,As always little Shirley Temple delivers a stellar performance in this depiction of life in the Civil War South. Worth the price.
3,Who Best But Shirley To Melt A Crabby Old Man's Heart?,"It's odd that Shirley Temple made two Civil War-era movies in the same year, with her charactesr being very similar. ""The Littlest Rebel"" took place during the Civil War and ""The Little Colonel"" took place right after the war.It's usually touching to see Shirley melting a crabby old man's heart as she did in some of her films, this being one of them. Here, it's Lionel Barrymore she converts into a good soul.The lead female role was played by Evelyn Venable and she really wasn't up to the standards set by previous Temple adult feminine leads such s Gloria Stuart, Karen Moreley, Rochelle Hudson, etc.. but that's not important.Temple, meanwhile, is so cute that she's even likable when she's a brat, as she acts several times with the old man (but apologizes later for her behavior). All in all, the lesser of the two ""war movies,"" but still a decent film"
5,late night viewing recommended,The little colonel is a very dark drama about a very old dirty old man and a young sex pot Lolita that draws the man into late night sex adventures. well written and a compelling tale that is bound to become a soft porn classic.it does however require the ability to understand innuendo and reading between the lines.
4,"Great showcase of Shirley's talents, a must-have.","The greatest showcase of Shirley's many talents there ever was! Tap-dancing up the stairs with Bill Robinson, crying on cue, being angry and sad and happy, is what makes this movie worthwhile! A young Southern woman defies her father and marries a Northerner right after the Civil War. The couple returns to live in the cottage next to the hot-headed Southerner's mansion, and, of course, with her many charms, Shirley becomes friends with her grandfather and convinces him to reunite with his daughter and her husband."
3,"Originals, But Too Many Are Missing","I'm an oldies DJ in New England, and I'd like to correct a misimpression offered by the sole reviewer posted here (2/25/04). The tracks on this CD are indeed original recordings--not recuts. You do need to watch out for recuts with the Platters--but not here. Problem is, though it does contain all the biggest Platters' hits, virtually all the lesser hits--those that peaked lower than #12 on the Billboard charts--are omitted in favor of some odd selections. You may be interested in hearing the Platters' rendition of ""Sixteen Tons"" (I wasn't), but where's 1959's ""Enchanted?"" Some lovely non-top-10 hits are sacrificed, and some pretty iffy material included. A better, more complete collection can be found elsewhere. But if you're looking for original recordings of the group's very biggest hits, this CD is perfectly adequate."
2,Interesting but ultimately unsatisfying,"The Irish famine is one of history's great tragedies. If you are looking for a brief description of the famine and the dangers faced by the emigrants in their travels abroad, this is a decent narrative. If you are more interested in the causes and the political back drop behind the Irish diaspora you should look elsewhere."
3,Engaging stories of hard times,"Mr. Laxton offers a well-researched account of the incredible challenges that each Irish immigrant must have faced in the most trying of times. The book's portrayal of the misery, hunger, and despair suffered during the long Transatlantic voyage was palpable. However, the lack of an identifiable and coherent theme over the course of 24 chapters was disappointing and often frustrating. Nevertheless, the book was compelling and a must for descendants of Irish immigrants of that period."
4,Tells the human stories of the Irish Famine tragedy.,"In 1840's Ireland, the Potato Blight was the immediate cause of the departure of thousands of ships, carrying the nearly one million emigrants escaping the Irish Famine to America. In The Famine Ships, Laxton narrates the stories of these emigrants and the many ships that brought them to the New World. It is a fascinating compilation derived from family histories handed down through the generations, describing the tragedies of the American Wakes (the morbid farewell ""parties"" for the emigrants), the horrible conditions aboard the ships, and the boundless optimism concerning the freedom of America.This is a well-written supplement to the various works on the Irish famine exodus, finally drawing attention to the human tragedy and the ships that defined a moment in Irish and American history."
3,Lightweight handling of a great subject; poor editing,"The ""Famine Ships"" is not a scholarly work on an important time in Irish and American History. Readers interested in fairly light, shallow treatment of the subject may enjoy the book. Readers interested in in-depth treatment of the subject should look elsewhere. As noted by other reviewers, there are technical problems with the book including poor copy editing and some writing problems. It is about one-draft away from being a better book."
2,Great research; compelling subject; poor editing,"The author has clearly done great research. The primary sources he has used allow him to present a very compelling story. Unfortunately, it appears that he published his first draft: full of typos, grammatical errors and contradictory statements. Too bad, because the content suffers from the complete lack of copy editing and ultimately it is an unsatisfactory read, no matter how good the material and how arduous the research"
3,Patrick Kennedy did not have a birth certificate,"In the chapter regarding the ancestors of JFK he mentioned that an amateur genealogist figured out which boat the immigrant Kennedy sailed on, on the back of his birth certificate. Born c. 1826 Patrick Kennedy did not have a birth certificate as these did not begin in Ireland until 1864, 6 years after his death. Maybe Katherine O'Brien viewed a naturalization certificate but who knows? I like this book since it is a quick read and I read it a chapter a day. No footnotes and definitely not as scholarly as other Irish books can be. This is not always a bad thing. It would give a good beginning to Famine history and then one should read deeper resources."
4,From Renaissance to Nutcracker is brilliant.,"The Los Angeles Guitar Quartet's Nutcracker Suite is a triumph for guitar arrangement. This selection is an excellent choice for one's holiday listening enjoyment. In the Renaissance dance suites included here, the L.A.G.Q. masterfully utilize a number of the percussive timbres available on the body of the classical guitar to complete the instrumentation and invoke the spirit of the pieces. Though the recording is not as loud as most of the other L.A.G.Q. recordings, the quality of the performances more than makes up for it."
5,wonderful music,"It just doesn't get better than this. If you want to hear Tchaikovsky played by super classical guitarists, this is the CD for you. Its the BEST!"
3,Love the product,The only reason it got 3 stars was because one of the boxes were opened and spilling out in the delivery box. It wasn't the post office. The external box was in good shape but the Ever Clean box was opened at the spout. I hate having to clean up a mess.
5,Favorite Cat Litter,This is great cat litter. I almost didn't buy it because of another review complaining about the scent. I guess to each his own but I personally really like the scent. I like this much better than the unscented.
1,WARNING CAT OWNERS,"I did not buy this litter on Amazon but rather at a local grocer. Let me tell you, this stuff clumps a little too well. My apartment was nice and odor free (yay!) with this litter, but after a while my cat started acting funny. I took her to the Vet and it turns out she had ingested a bunch of this stuff and it was clogging her up! I had the perfume kind (which has a very strong scent) and the cat liked the smell apparently and thought it was food or something. So, after giving her some laxatives, she continued to eat it. After this she acted normal, then suddenly dropped dead! WITH CAT LITTER IN HER MOUTH. Now you tell me whats going on here!"
5,Great DVD. Shame about the packaging.,"A wonderful, very professional documentary of Mother Teresa's life. Not only does she speak but also her niece & members of her congregation that were close to her. I can't recommend it highly enough. A word of warning about ordering though. My copy was mailed in a thin cardboard envelope with no padding & the cover was totally smashed. I would request they at least bubble wrap it."
1,Disappointing-- too much on the funeral,This video was a great disappointment. The whole thing keeps coming back to her funeral punctuated with snippets of her teachings. But after every snippet of teaching there is a return to the funeral. Really not very inspirational and quite a disappointment. Her funeral events should not be the focus of such a movie. Her legacy went beyond the funeral.
3,Live On Lenox -Dame Grease,"Producer who produced many hits for Dmx is here with a compilation album. Live On Lenox is a good compilation feat. DMX,Scareface,Drag-On and some new cats as well. Album has few bangin tracks and production from Dame is good as well so this album should make it's mark in the game. If you like Dmx's first album then you should like this one as well."
1,WARNING! Do not buy this!,"Yo! This CD is no good! The beats are weak, and so are the lyrics. It is a complete waste of money. Why do you think people are selling it for $7.99? Because it is weak. I bought if for a party I was throwing, and I got completely laughed at for playing such a weak album. So don't buy this dumb music!!!!"
5,Very basic realities of how advertising really works.,The video vampire is one of the most common errors in advertising. Trying to be cute and sheek is often given more weight than the advertising message.
3,Lacks Photos,"Be forewarned, this paperback edition lacks all the original photographs that appear in the original hardback edition. It has the color maps of the original edition reprinted in b&w. Search out the original edition."
1,Terrible,Tasted terrible and I do not know if I would ever get this type of jerky again. Meat tasted as though it was bad and the flavoring tasted like chemicals.
3,Poorly organized fluff,"This book has an interesting premise, but unfortunately the execution didn't live up to it's promise. First, it was poorly organized. I found myself thinking, wait, didn't she say the same thing 50 pages ago? I realized after a while this was because she really only had about 50 pages of content but needed something to fill the rest of the 250 pages. As many of the other reviewers pointed out, the tone was a bit self-serving and condescending, and also she dips into unnecessary political commentary. Why turn off half your audience if you don't have to?"
5,SMART WOMAN. SMART CONCEPT.,"I've seen Lis several times on television commenting on things of national importance, and I've always been impressed by her sharp mind, but also her kindness. She's not your typical tv pundit. This book shows that what we should all do better: approach our arguments rationally, rather than irrationally. WIth 8 Steps, Lis shows how lawyers do this in the courtroom and you can do it in life. I'm giving a copy to my mother for Mother's Day. It's a book that everyone can learn from."
1,"""Winning Every Time"" is a loser","I cannot disagree more with the previous reviews of this rubbish ""pep talk lit"" posing as a self-help book. The conclusions Miss Wiehl arrives at are hackneyed while being condescending. The material is contrived, and her delivery is fluffy. The whole ""court room as life"" bit is more depressing than anything. Miss Wiehl's cheery presentation of this constructed reality is nausiating."
1,Handle the Trials of Your Life Sans the Tripe in This Book,"I found Winning Every Time to be improbable, hard to stomach, and written in a condescending tone. This book is filled with the ""what ifs"" of a perfect world. It is a sad and scary thought that lawyers think that the public wants to think as they do. It is equally as scary (and dangerous) to find an author who thinks she has the answers for every problem or situation. This book espouses self-help rhetoric without adhering to a rule of social services which is -DO NO HARM. These `blanket' one size fits all solutions just don't work in the real world. This generic psychobabble is full of cheap sentiment and contrived conclusions. This is self promotion masquerading as self help."
4,Brooklyn Heights History,"This is a wonderful book as we are new to Brooklyn Heights and are eager to learn it's history. However, the condition of the book was less than what i expected. Just a bit disappointing in that respect."
4,Mr Bungle Fans Beware,Any Mr Bungle fans looking to explore more into the world of bungle I must warn you this album may not be exactly what you are looking for. With that said and done it is an absolutely incredible musical experiance. At first its extreemly heavy middle eastern influence through me off but after several listenings a definate good addition to a music fans cd collection. The reason for only 4 stars is do to the lack luster final two tracks of this disc that left me with a very bad taste in my mouth
2,Half involved,"2 1/2SC3's special concoction can be fun, but more often then not songs do not go past mere experiment into the realm of involving music. Isolated, these elements can be indulgent, which is mostly what occurs here. It is only when everything is brought together in the rarely achieved fully-fleshed track that any potential is realized."
2,Japanese? Appears so. Copper? NO!,"I was under the impression that this would be copper connections because of the 'copper' looking bolts, the brown hughe.. and other B&A; product pictures having pictures. Copper is a better conductor, thus better spark, better efficiency. mpg etc.. makes a big deal over the course of tens of thousands of miles.That is unfortunate. Keep shopping if you want copper. Not sure who still makes them."
3,"OK, if you skip the frustrating aerobics part","The warm-up segment of this video is fun and effective. The mat work, while I found it difficult at first, by sticking with it, did really strengthen my abdominal core and yield results.HOWEVER, I have to agree with the other reviewers regarding the aerobics segment. I also found it incredibly frustrating; I tried over and over again to ""catch on,"" but I never did. Now I do the warm-up and mat work, and skip over the cross-training section and instead, do some other video or exercise for my aerobic workout."
4,Great Intense Workout,"This is a great DVD for those who are looking for a combination of cardiovascular, strength-training, and flexibility. There are three segments, each working a different area. It's vigorous, and hard to keep up with the first time through. But, as your strength and flexibility improve, you'll find it easier with time. I've tried several of the videos featuring Jennifer Kreis, and they are a great step up from the easier videos if you're wanting more of a challenge. I would highly recommend this video. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I had some difficultly keeping up with everything, and the drummers in the background are kinda cheesy!"
1,"If I could give it less than a star, I would...","I love working out to videos, but as has been said by other reviewers, the cardio portion (which is a major part of my workouts) is terrible: there is no time taken to instruct on the dance moves, the steps change without warning. I get irritated within the first 3 minutes of the cardio and turn the video off in disgust, with only the 15 minute warmup under my belt for a work out. I have come back to this video every year, to determine whether I just gave up too easily, and the same outcome occurs. The warmup is good, the pilates part is pretty challenging, and the stretch at the end is nice, but without the cardio, I just don't feel like I've had a workout."
1,Terrible,"Despite some really good core-strengthening moves, the choreography in this video just makes you feel ridiculous. They ruined what could have been a good workout with boring, repetitive bongos and moves that just make you fling yourself around the room. If you don't have lots of space, forget it."
2,disappointing,"The warm-up is short and really not adequate if you plan to do the centering mat exercises (which I found amusing toward the end!). The verbal cues are terrible during the crosstraining dance section. The 3-5lb. weight workout is good if you're a beginner. The centering mat workout starts off good, but quickly gets very difficult--it would take me many years to be able to do most of those exercises!"
3,Its acceptable,"I did this video for years before I got into Rael Pilates, it is good, but if you are going to spend your money for Pilates buy Rael pilates."
2,Discouraging,"I love to work out; I enjoy dance and pilates. BUT--this video was not for me.I liked the weight segments but the dance ones are only good if you have a LOT of room in your living room to travel (otherwise you must compromise the moves). Also, the dance moves are awkward and dorky, not fun or fluid."
3,Only for dancers,"I love aerobics and was willing to give pilates a try so I started with this one. Holy moly. I, unfortunately, never took a dance class as a kid. With ineffective cueing and the absense of a 1-2-3-4 count, I was completely lost. I didn't feel that I'd gotten a very good workout when all was said and done. I would have liked more aerobic movement if I could've actually done it.With quite a lot of work, I think I might be able to get some of these moves down, but it will be a while until I can get a good workout from it!"
5,what does the audio in the back of the unit mean,can i connect a digital camera in the audio in the back of the unit
4,Great for KIDS,"If your kids stay on your PC all the time, download wierd stuff, mess with your settings, have TV's in their rooms - then this is GREAT for them! It is nearly impossible to mess up and you can't do a lot of stuff (like download) with it. It is great for general surfing and checking email. Perfect for a child to keep the adult's computer free!If you are an adult and want to use the internet, buy a PC. This thing will aggravate you to peices."
4,Dark and Stormy....,"Royalty Ginger Beer is great to make a Dark and Stormy... Ice in a tall glass, 1.5 oz Dark Rum, juice of 1/2 a lime, fill glass with ginger beer and garnish with lime wedge and serve with a straw.... yum... enjoy!"
1,Sent diet,Did not order diet but that is what was sent. Buyer beware I guess with this company. Don't see anything on the desciption that says diet.
3,??,"I am not as happy with this shoe as I am with the other Clark's sandals that I have. Clark's is my favorite kind of shoe. This sandal must need breaking in, unlike their other sandals. The straps are uncomfortable to my feet, hurts my toe. I do like how they look though."
1,Avoid especially if your a die hard fan,Sound is incredibly horribly terribly bad. Video is ok. Extremely dissapointed. Feel I should destroy my copy to protect real fans of a great band from seeing it. Rhino video is a name I'll avoid in the future if possible. Very lazy indeed. Just horrible and painful even for a die hard fan of one of the best bands of all time. Thin Lizzy. Looking for something better on the boys.
2,Thin lizzy,"Interesting as an earlk lizzy document,sond and video qualit preet poor but what the hell it was 4 and ahalf bucks"
3,Great Show Crap Sound!,This is very much a take it or leave it DVD. This was shot in Australia with a different drummer because Brian Dowwney was not able to play due to an injury. It's a short set (about 40 min.) and it's shot during the day which I feel always detracts from concert films. The bonus here is we get a show with Gary Moore in the band. So that alone makes me like it. However the sound is horrible! Even for something as cheaply shot as this. It's thin in parts.. Lots of distortion. You name it.This film is not for the passive fan but for major and I do mean major Thin Lizzy fan. I can never figure Rhino out. They put out amazing CD's but their DVD's always are about bootleg quality. Happy I have this in my collection but it will be years before I sit thru it again.
4,Raw but Cool,Not the greatest sound quality but for what it is it Rocks. Just watching a young Gary Moore is worth price of the Disc.
3,A rare view of a great band!,"I just wish the sound was better, other than that, it rocks!a must have for all Lizzy fans, imo."
2,At least it looks OK.,"I held off buying this on VHS because of the so-so reviews of the sound quality. When I saw the DVD was enhanced to 5.1 surround, I thought it had been remastered and the sound would be great....WRONG!!!! It still sounds terrible. The footage is classic but i've heard bootlegs that sound better. Why watch if you can't enjoy the music."
3,Only for die hard thin lizzy fans,"the sound of this release is just awful! One of the poorest I've ever heard for a ""remastered"" disc. The camera work is okay (you have to remember the year it was) you can actually see a small crew pushing a large television studio camera back and forth in front of the stage. But the sound just kills this disc."
1,A Tribute?,"Giving a tribute to this no talent is like Giving Bush an award for peace. Maybe if she got some actual talent, wrote her own songs, and became a popular artist with actual staying power, then she would be deserving of a tribute album. Last as long as the Stones or Madonna and we'll talk.Go back to being your sister's shadow, Ashlee."
3,They Disgraced Big L With This,"Big L put out a classic with ""Lifestylez Ov Da Poor & Dangerous"" then after he got shot the vultures released this half real-half fake album. ""Holdin' It Down"", as commercial as it gets, had L turning around in his grave, a disgrace to his person and everything he stood for. How much did they pay Dalton Higgins for saying the whole album gells well??!! Nothing gells well on ""The Heist Revisited"", ""Games"", ""Holdin' It Down"" & ""Deadly Combination"". On ""Deadly Combination"" they use some wack verse of L completely unappropriate that was never meant to be released anyway, that makes L look like some average MC after you hear Pac. ""The Heist & ""Casualties of a Dice Game"" were older tracks, you can hear how young he still was when he made them, that were left off the first album with a reason."
5,RIP Big L,"""the big picture"" by big L is a great album to remember him by. unfortunately L didnt live to see the release of ""the big picture"" this album ranks very high with 2000's other top rap releases. some of the highlights of the album are ""ebonics"" and ""deadly combination"" with 2pac (RIP). there are other guest appearences by DITC, sadat x and others.L boasts on 98 freestyle ""i'm older and better this is me at my best"". this was true. L died in his prime. its sad that he never made it to roc a fella records and will never drop any new songs but at least we have albums like ""the big picture"" and ""lifestylez ov da poor and dangerous"" which ensure that he will not soon be forgotten."
4,BIG L without a mic is like China without rice,"This new release is D.O.A.(dope on arrival), packed with ""BIG L yrics"" and beats. Shocking hip-hoppers since ""Lifestyles of the Poor and Dangerous"", he fell short of a lifestyle of the rich and famous, being murdered in Harlem World in 1999. He's was well on his way to reach that superstatus, and ""THE BIG PICTURE"" is living proof that his music will live on. Tracks with Tupac, Kool G, Kane, OC, Guru, plus a freestyle he kicked on the STRETCH AND BOBBITO radio program dissin' Canibus (on August 11, 98') make this one of the hottest albums for the summer 2000 (and there haven't been many if any). BIG L is internationaly known so true hip-hoppers worldwide will have no need to dig in the crates for this one. Add this work of art to your cart and explore the legacy left by BIG L."
3,sorry,"Alright Big L had descent skill and a nice style. I don't know why people jock him like he's God with a mic though. Seriously, his songs weren't very creative at all, his lyrics were just o.k., and the cd overall just doesn't impress. In my opinion it sounded like Big L was always three lines away from turning into Jay-Z(garbage). I liked the track with 2PAC, and a few others, a very few others. It for the most part just sounded like mainstream garbage to me though, with all the talk of cash, jewels....It's realy only a 2 1/2 star album, but what the heck. To anyone saying that i'm hating or whatever that's not even the case, i bought this album expecting it to be good and even tried to justify it at first but i'm sorry, it's just not. R.I.P. Big L.P.S. if you like music about... and that kind of ish (i don't know why you would) but if you do he's stil better than Jay-Z and most mainstream craaaap."
5,Very Dope Album,"i love this album.it has some classic tracks on this, still i they messed up with 1 track IMO which is ""Games"" a/k/a Games Females Play which is the Original Version of this song.4.5/5"
5,"wow, just wow","ive never heard anything like this, the whole album is just amazingthis is god disguised as big li hadnt heard of him until just a little while ago when one of my people showed me ""da graveyard"" from his first album which just blew me awayhis flow is unbelievable, his rhymes, the beats, everything there isnt enough i can say about big lif you like real rap, like biggie or wu tang, you gotta get what you need this album is hot"
4,Holdin' it down,"All in all, this is a good album, a final project Big L would have been proud of. Many artists make key contributions; Tupac combines with L on ""Deadly Combination"" and Big Daddy Kane on ""Platinum Plus"", one of the albums highlights. However, with his untimely death, Big L left some big gaps on the album. On ""Fall Back"", Big L raps for approximately 30 seconds while Kool G Rap carries the song for the duration. But worth buying? Hell yeah. ""The Heist"" alone is grounds for buying this album (the second version though could have been left off). I gave this album 4 stars because the shortened songs put a damper on things, but if you're looking for creative, catchy lyrics with tight production, get this album. Your collection isn't complete without it."
4,If you like this...,"just wanted to put my two cents in. big l could have and would have been the best. to me, this is an absolute essential album. he rhymes like no other has, and apparently someone didnt like what he had to say. granted his lyrics were rough, but they never lacked emotion and humor and an overall vivid picture of what life was like... the only album to top this is harlem's finest, a freestyle history. truely amazing. even jay-z is at the top in this album. big l makes it an art to tear into and burn up everyone with the mic."
4,R.I.P. L,"This is a real nice album. Big L really comes hard on his lyrics, gotta love the freestyle.Notable songs are ""Ebonics""""Deadly Combinationz""""98 Freestyle"" and my personal fav ""Fall Back"" Which features my boy Kool G!If you've been curious about L and wanna hear him I would suggest this album first to turn you onto L then you Gotta pick up ""L.O.T.P.A.D.""R.I.P. L"
5,Stories for the Children's Hour,This is a great book full of short stories. They are perfect for bedtime. There are also questions at the end of each story to create discussion.
2,"At Best, A Single","I'll grant David Jacobs one thing (or even two) -- Jeff Rovin's fine ""Return of the Wolf Man"" was definitely a hard act to follow, and Jacobs does toss in some allusions to other Universal Horror (even Boris Karloff's mad character from ""The Black Cat"" appears). But all in all, this was a muddled book, trying a little too hard to bring in the Bride of Frankenstein and other ""second stringers"" in the Universal mythos. Some of the reasons the Universal horror series ran out of steam in the 1940s are evident here -- last minute appearances by the Frankenstein Monster (just for the sake of showing him) and back stories that underemphasize the monsters. Jeff Rovin is definitely missed. Too bad, but I'll give Jacobs credit for trying. Hopefully, the next volume (if we get that far)will change the course for a series that looks headed into oblivion."
4,GOOD OL' PULP HORROR!,"This long-awaited sequel to RETURN OF THE WOLFMAN (1998) is a campy tour de force that harkens back to the days of the old serials and pulps, yet with a modern twist. Mad scientists, mad labs, Countess Marya (Drac's daughter) out to rule the world with a cartel of satanic-Scientists...PLUS the Bride of Frankenstein AND the grandson of the Werewolf of London...Holy Moley! Saturday afternoon creepies at their best! Enjoy! CAN'T WAIT FOR THE THIRD INSTALLEMENT(and hope I don't haveta wait 2 more years! )."
2,Who are these guys?,"The song titles are very familiar, and those who grew up listening to the originals will no doubt know exactly what they expect to hear. Unfortunately, they will not hear it. These are remakes, doubtless made at a much later date than the originals with which everyone is so familiar. The Drifters went through lineup changes every few years, and this lienup just doesn't have the ""snap"" of the originals. The tempo seems to drag, and the notes aren't quite as high as you expect them to be. One positive note is that with today's more advanced recording techniques, the recording quality is better than you'd expect the originals to sound (though not as clear as it should be). If you're looking for a quality re-issue of the original tunes as you remember them, you should look elsewhere."
5,titanic series,"although I already knew that the ship sank, it was nice to know the feelings and thoughts of the people that survived, I liked the book because it showed how the characters overcame their fear and went on with their lives, and how a high society patron helped those that needed to be helped and that people are people no matter what ""class"" they belong too. It was a beautiful book and I would recommend it."
5,Oh wow!,"Well, i LOVE this group. Even though i only own this cd i've heard others and thats what i think... OH WOW. Im a musician (classical) and hearing this its like rock has always been a part in an instrument as classical as the Cello... If you havent heard of them before this is a cd that represents what they are...... i've just heard they are coming to my country (venezuela) in just 2 months..... i cant miss it!!"
5,Luv it,"I am new to the band still, and have only heard some of their songs on youtube before. Originally, I bought the CD for the ""Farewell"" track, but now I am liking the others as well. There's something about a cello that connects to the deepest, most meditative reflection and sometimes melancholy in the soul. Pairing that with Apocalyptica's metal twist makes for a band that can be enjoyed by both classical and hard rock audiences."
1,Disappointing purchase,"I bought this ""massager"" with hopes it would enhance the play time between me and my fiance. Plus it was a good deal for the price, so I thought. Well, you get what you pay for. This Aphrodite lacks power and won't even be that good for massaging an aching neck because it's silicone interchangeable heads prevent you from getting a solid point of pressure. I do not think I will ever buy this brand of product again. I am sticking with the wee vibe or Lelo products."
3,"This was a bday gift, works great jus SUPER LOUD, lol","I received this as a bday gift, it works great, but sounds like a lawnmower, lol. No discretion here! Love the color too."
4,bang for your buck.,"purchased this on a whim (it was 75% off). the initial charge up didn't take that long. i don't think it's as bulky as most users say it is. it's a plug-in massager, what do you expect something the size of a cellphone? the infrared is a nice touch if your muscles ache. speeds are fine, it's worth the buy."
1,Useless,"This vibrator has 2 speeds & is noisy. I loved my old one by Sunbeam, but it broke after 20 years, & they no longer make them. I ordered another one yesterday from Conair. The Aprodite is not what I was looking for. I wasted my $."
1,Poor Quality - Buyer Beware,"This was purchased after seeing it on Oprah's show. Bad decision! It arrived on time and is nicely packaged. If that is all you need this will be perfect --- however if you want it to work beware. After following the directions to charge it overnight before use it worked for about two seconds and quit. Thinking that it may not have been fully charged it was plugged back in for a full 24 hours. After wasting electricity on this piece ""made in China"" junk it still did not work. Of course the good news is that this product is not returnable. Maybe it can be used as a potato masher or kept at bedside for home defense since it large and heavy, oh but the cheap plastic construction will not take much abuse. Beware - do not buy!!"
2,Much ado about nothing,"Save your money, I know Oprah recommended it, but there are far better for far less $. Infrared is better as a night light then it is to warm you up and about the time you might actually start to like the massage the charge wears out."
1,STARTED SMOKING and Blew Up,"I bought this item because I have shoulder pain from the port that was installed for chemotherapy. The warming feature seemed like it would relieve my pain and the vibrating feature might move the chemo along. I was using it on my shoulder when it started to smell funny, and thank goodness I put it down so that I could get up off the sofa because it then began to smoke and gave a loud pop. There was no need to turn it off because it was truly dead. When I communicated this to the company so that this danger could be avoided by others, I received a return note saying that the warranty was past the date of return. Obviously they read their complaints for content. I would NOT buy this again and wouldn't recommend it either. Instead, I bought a warming device that you put in the microwave. Works better for my purposes. It's a good thing I wasn't using the Berman for the other purpose it's advertised. I might have an overinflated idea of myself, smoking hot and all that."
5,Think It Is Great!,"My husband purchased this for me for my birthday and let me say that it is the gift that keeps on giving! I love it. I use it as a ""personal"" massager and compared to other massagers of the same type, this works better. I especially like the high setting. (It is noisy on high.) I have never felt it heat up as it claims to do but that is not why I wanted it."
2,Semi-satisfied,"The Aphrodite is relatively heavy and a bit bigger than I expected. Also, it's fairly loud and looses charge quickly. The infrared barely heats up at all and only heats up on the slower of the two speeds (turtle slow and rabbit fast); this lack of range leaves a huge something to be desired somewhere in the middle. I wouldn't recommend the product or buy it again."
3,B+,Well I guess you get what you pay for. I bought this item for about $20 less than other sites listed it for. I'm pretty certain its a chinese replica...the heater never worked and the product is an inferior plastic. BUT the silicon is real and its an awesome change from the hitachi magic wand. I see now the price has been jacked up to other sites so I would say buy direct from Dr. Berman unless you find a deal that makes it worth it. Amazon.com no longer accepts returns on this item (although I wouldnt have gone to the trouble even if they did)
1,Buyer Be aware,Poorly made. Never was able to get it to work properly. Best if you use it while plugged in. The company will not exchange it after 30 days from purchase even if it's on backorder for 3 months. Poor communication from company (still waiting).
3,Nice,Nice product. It does the job for a good while. BUT !!!! The longer you have it the weaker it gets.
3,It's huge!,"I thought it was going to be at least half the size of what actually came in the mail. It's about the length of my forearm which makes it very bulky. but it does do it's purpose although only the pinpoint head is of any use, the others are too broad to make a difference."
3,OH NOOOOOOOOOO,DOES NOT TURN ON FRESH OUT OF THE BOX TAKES 12 HOURS TO CHARGE. AFTER THAT CHARGE ONLY LAST 30MINS IF THAT. ON A SCALE OF 1-10 VIBRATION IS A 6 FOR A QUICK SECOND. GREATS AS A MUSCLE RELAXER OR WHAT EVER. WILL DO IF ITS YOUR ONLY OPTION.OVERALL GOOD BUT NOT GREAT.
1,"Not what I expected, I fell for the ""Oprah"" buzz.","I fell for the Oprah buzz on this product. I wish I had checked out other vibrators before I ordered it. It is very heavy, bulky and mine did not heat. Amazon's return policy is great, I was able to return it and get a refund because it was defective. I see others have had the same problem.My advice is to shop around and read the reviews."
2,Disappointing,I was disappointed with the strength of this. It was not as good as advertised. I got it for a good price and now I know why.
3,It works!,"It definitely works for me, but it is cumbersome having to plug it in to charge it up. I would prefer to go back to the battery operated one personally. It is quite large, I don't really think you need something that big to get a great response. I think it is o.k."
1,Order Incomplete,"There were no instructions with the product. I have tried repeatedly to get someone to send me the instructions for this item and after three weeks, I still have not received them. I will pursue this until I receive them but you can be sure it is the last time I will deal with Amazon."
3,Not too happy,"Sadly, the music over shadowed the choir voices. Other than that, it would have been a good recording/CD."
2,Big and Cheap,"Good things.Works.Looks niceFloatsGood with 6"" size waves.Water cooling even works.Bad ThingsVery slow about 5mphtwo motor designcontrols are off, Right engine on, Left enigine on, Both engine on. NOTHING IN BETWEEN."
4,ADMIRAL Miami Vice RC Electric 3 1/2 FT Boat,Have not got a chance to try it out yet but this is my first RC Boat and it seems to be made out of vary thin kinda cheap plastic. I don't know if all the rc boat are made out of this but its durably i question. also the water cooled motors tubing was all kinked so i fix it but if no water could get in the tubes it might have over heated and broke. i don't know it just seems cheaply done but will see it might be me and the boat might work grate! can't what for winter to be over ;)
5,Mom loves cooking on it,My mom loves this newer model. Its sturdy and solid and easy to operate and change out the fuel tank
2,Not Good,"I liked how this movie started out. Then it turned into an overly sentimental, horribly acted piece of trash. I don't understand how anyone could give this movie 4 stars or better and have even a decent taste in films."
4,Intersting Korean Movie,"I had to watch this film fro a group project in a sociology class. Very intersting look into korean film making. Kind of slow with intense random bouts of violence. Check it out for an interesting foreign film, although I felt the story wasn't too fleshed out. Shows how much they really value honor and friendship above all else."
5,Amazing movie,"This movie is fantastic. It shows the love of four friends and what they go through throughout there progessing lives. I love Jang Dong Gun and he is one of my favorite actors. He was awsome in Tae guk Gi,(which is my favorite movie of all time) and 2009 lost memories. amazing film!"
2,Some dreams don't last,"Bought this for my son's friends to use when they got together to play his xbox. Since it wasn't the main controller, it did not get that much use or abuse, but it still failed after a short time. Wouldn't buy it again."
4,Xbox xDream Pro Controller Green,The xDream Pro Controller is a wonder and excellent product! The joystick is very easy hold and control. Thank You!!
3,Cute but a little irritating,I got it since it was on sale and pretty cute looking but I've decided frills are just not for me. They itch at times.
3,"""Mrs. Burke, I thought you...were Dale!""","This episode is just one of many that contain the ""deathless"" line: ""Mrs. Burke, I thought you...were Dale!""Naturally, our whole family likes these episodes, because we starred in the original 1968 Grape-Nuts TV commercial from which this riff comes. (Yes, Mrs. Burke AND Dale are real, alive, well, and living in the USA.)Many thanks to MST3K's Best Brains for riffing our commercial decades after it ran (and to Mr. Murphy for helping to clear up the trouble about the origin of this riff)!"
4,"At its early best, MST3K delivers many 1st season laughs","Although MST3K would really hit its stride as far as pacing, themes, sets, cast chemistry and joke writing in season 2, this is one of the best episodes from season 1 and it's the only one you can buy on DVD at the time of this writing. The jokes run a wide range of topics from the absurdity of an animated severed hand to the acting ability of Alan Hale, Jr. Although the humor is not as dense as in some later episodes like Cave Dwellers or Pod People, there is still no shortage of humor tossed at this B grade science fiction/horror film. If you love MST3K, you'll want to see this early gem."
2,Not What I'm Used To,"I am a huge fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but I was disappointed with ""The Crawling Hand"". At first I thought it was really cute because this episode was taken from the first season, so it was interesting to see the really corny sets and even cornier special effects. However, as I watched the episode more, the more bored I became. Granted, ""The Crawling Hand"" is not the most exciting movie to watch, but it just didn't seem as though Joel and the bots were as funny. Tom Servo had a completely different voice and Dr. Forrester had a different assistant.I know that this episode is a part of MST3K history and for that I give it respect, but I personally just could not get into this episode. I would suggest it, though, to other fans of the series so they can make their own decisions about it. Like I said, since it's one of the first episodes, it should be watched, but don't expect to be rolling on the floor laughing very much."
4,True drama!,"This movie was excellent! To appreciate this film, a person has to know what great acting really is, and this film shows just that. This all star cast of 10 women telling their ""LOVE"" stories play with your emotions till the end. They tell you everything that comes along with being in love, in the raw!NOTE: If anyone says anything distasteful about this excellent film, they don't know film. Trust me, I'm a writer/director"
4,I Thought I Was Watching Interviews,"I Thought I was watching actual interviews but found that the whole thing was an written story. I find the style unique and refreshing. Each story has its own philosophy in itself, and I see womens' strength to be honest."
4,Canon Powershot 550,This camera came with the complete box of accessories and booklets. All were in the original wrappers. I was very pleased with the quickness of the order and true to the info that was supplied.
4,"Beautiful sound, and a really interesting CD","This really deserves 4 1/2 stars, but I agree with William Coburn, especially with regard to the sound, which has great depth, bass and resonance. Fine was certainly eclectic, moving easily among many different genres. His approach to twelve-tone, shows, like that of George Perle, that serialism did not have to become sterile, or academic."
2,Beginners beware....,"Forget the cover's hype, this intro to what Symanantec touts as ""the easiest way ever to create Java applications"" is best suited for the experienced programmer. Rather than build on Cafe's strengths, the authors bog down in detailed descriptions of Java and C program languages, virtually ignoring program functionalities. The format does not help either, riddled as it is with check marks and bonus sections to satisfy the publisher's series outline. More bones here than meat.How much better to help beginners learn by doing, with practice problems that focus on solutions that lure readers further into the mysteries of Java programmming."
2,A fair reference but a poor learning aid.,"After spending time with ""Discover Visual Cafe""I have come to regret my purchase. The first half of the book is little more than a Java reference which may be fine for someone who is an experienced object-oriented programmer, but if you want to learn how to PROGRAM in Java this book provides no guidance.The second half of ""Discover Visual Cafe"" is even less useful in learning how to create Java applications/applets in Visual Cafe. You would be just as well off with the Help function in Cafe.Like most who write computer programming books, the authors of ""Discover Visual Cafe"" assume that just describing the elements of a language or application is sufficient to be able to use it productively. Merely describing what the parts of a car do is of little use in learning how to use those parts to accomplish the task of driving the car.""Discover Visual Cafe"" has bells and whistles but no substance. Don't waste your money!"
2,Enclosure ripped within a year,"We bought this trampoline from a local dealer. We thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread, however, the enclosure began ripping within the first year. No one has ever hung from the top of the enclousre as the manufacturer warns not to, nor have we ever exceeded the weight limit on the trampoline. We planned to replace the enclosure only to learn that there is no way to do so without getting an entire new unit because the enclosure is sewn into the mat. Magic Circle boasts a 10 year warranty on the frame with a 1 year warranty plus 4 year prorated warranty on the mat and springs. What they fail to mention is the enclosure is not covered and even if it were, you have to ship the unit prepaid to them for inspection before they will even make a decision on warranty coverage. Bottom line, we got only one year out of this product before it became a safety hazard."
5,A Fun Fairy Tale,"Grace Kelly MacGuire is a romance novelist. She writes a series in which a trio of eccentric fairy godmothers help couples find love. Suddenly, she finds that the trio has come to life, and only she can see them. Naturally, she goes for psychiatric help. She picks the doctor most likely to be old and grandfatherly, Dr. Artemus Aaronson, who turns out to be gorgeous and young, all this after winning a free makeover from a radio station she doesn't listen to. Later she wins a new wardrobe, obviously the fairies have been busy. She has both an evil stepmother and stepsister who want her trust fund and an evil would be husband, who wants her money. All in all this is a really funny book, and I look forward to finally reading the rest of the series, Max's brother and sister are featured."
2,Way too much Syrup,"Although the dialog is well written and I was excited about the fairytale premise, I felt like I was watching a bad Lifetime movie. You know the ones where you just want to throw up your hands and rewrite the screenplay. If you are into that Lifetime super, sticky-sweet romance that is so predictable, then this is your romance book. As for me I like some edgyness to my kidnappings and not the over the top psycho that deserves laughs more than shudders and gets off scot free in the end.I think this author has promise if she would please tighten up the plot and leave off some of the syrup. Since this one was written in 2000 she may have done just that."
3,A little more meat,"I always love time travel stories, and I've read some great anthologies, but this one left me feeling that there could have been more. ""Time Machines"" by Bill Adler, is a great anthology of time travel stories. Or if you want a full novel, I'd go for ""Timeline"" by Michael Crichton or ""Twilight"" by Nicholas Stember, both excellent reads."
3,9/12ths of a good collection,"Time travel is one of my very favorite topics. This anthology of time-travel stories contains works by some popular writers, Diane Duane, Dean Wesley Smith and James P Hogan, for example. As with any anthology, I enjoyed some stories more than others and for the most part I enjoyed each of the stories. Some - like 'Mint Condition' are more innovative than the rest.Three* of them, however, do not belong in this collection. They are good stories but aren't really time-travel stories. It is as if the author wrote a story and then made a couple changes to slide them into this sub-genre. The editor should not have included them (IMHO).Here are the stories ranked in my personal preference:Mint ConditionConvolutionsBlood TrailTheory Of RelativityIn The Company Of HerosDoing TimeA Touch Through TimeJeff's Best JokeIterations*Things I Didn't Know My Father Knew*Palempest Day*The Gift Of A Dream"
3,Only if you LOVE time travel stories,"Past Imperfect has its ups and downs. Of the twelve stories included in this anthology, only 4 are first rate: Blood Trail, A Touch Through Time, Mint Condition and In the Company of Heroes. These stoies made me devour them, only as a good story can. The rest vary from dull to awful. If you are just getting acquainted with time travel, avoid it."
2,The title says it all,"A compendium of short stories about time travel. Some intriguing ideas, but most end just when they're getting somewhat interesting. It felt like the short-story format was a cop-out for writers who couldn't flesh out a full narrative or really dig into the past or the future beyond a superficial description. (BTW, the stripe of paint on the house in ""Palimpsest Day"" seemed very familiar -- does anybody remember this being in another story, but to cooler effect?)~Addendum, 9/17/04: Thanks much to Hilary for IDing Jack Finney's ""I'm Scared,"" from his excellent short story collection ""About Time,"" as the origin of the timeslipped paint stripe concept."
3,A Mixed Bag,"All anthologies have stories that are terrific, stories that are deadly dull, and stories inbetween. For me, there were too many stories in this book in the second and third category and only a very few in the ""terrific"" category. If you're a time travel bug, then okay. If you're not, then find yourself something else to read."
3,Good Time with Jimmy Jones,"I love this album and believe it is a worthy album if you are a Jimmy Jones fan. I am a diehard fan of this man and have been since I was a teen. Both he and his songs are very unique and original. I have a lot of the old Cub 45's and would give anything if someone would release all his work, including his VeeJay material such as Mr.FixIt and No Insurance, on CD. You have to find the original recordings of Good Timin' and Handyman on compilation discs (best are on Mercury), but the updated Good Timin' and Handyman on this disk are great fun. Keep up the good work Jimmy!"
4,GROOVY!!,"A nostalgic, campy marvel, PUFNSTUF The Movie is a sign of its time. The wacky Kroft humor matched with a hippie sensibility and tuneful songs should be entertaining to both children and their parents who were fans of the original series. Both Mama Cass and Martha Raye are great and add a level of adult humor to the film that was such a staple on the show. Although Witchipoo spends most of the time screaming at her henchbeasts, and the plot is thinner than a pancake, PUFNSTUF still grooves along with it's fun characters, atmosphere, and music.(Sadly, the theme song is nowhere to be found in the movie)."
3,Great Kiddie Fare.........,"Jack Wild Was Discovered By Talent Agent June Collins (Phil's Mother!).He Began On The London Stage In ""Oliver"" Then Was Awarded The Film Role....After That Success He Took On The Pufnstuf Show In Hollywood... He Also Put Out Three Albums...His Career Took A Dive After That........He Did Make Several Films In Bit Parts Later In Life Before Developing Throat Cancer...Jack Died At The Age Of 54 On March 1st 2006....."
5,HR Pufnstuf,"GREAT choice, bought as a gift for my brother, he grew up watching this show, and had heard the movie was available. I received it in stellar time. And he has since watched it 3 times, very enjoyable. All will appreciate this movie. Great for all ages also. I highly recommend this purchase."
5,What a flashback,"I love this movie I can remember seeing it at school for the first time on a reel to reel projector and we never got to see the end of the movie. Thank you Video gods for giving me a chance to share the fun and ""groovieness"" of this movie with my kids, who by the way love this movie. They get the camp and the silliness from the 70's and think it is wonderful. I just wish we could get this on DVD. I have the series which is great but need the movie on DVD too"
4,So fun to remember...,"When I was young, Sid and Marty Krofft were a large part of Saturday morning fun. From H.R. Pufnstuf to Lidsville, the songs and the colors were endless. I purchased this DVD because for years, my sister and I would make a reference to looking like Witchiepoo whenever we were having a bad hair day. I wanted my girls to see her (Billie Hayes), and hear her. And of course, I remember Jimmy (Jack Wild) as my first crush...We loved watching and laughing together. This DVD does not disappoint."
2,Disappointing,"I didn't think this was a particularly great book. The storyline/mystery was pretty basic, with no interesting twists or turns. I didn't buy the motives for any of the characters; particularly August Riordan --no reason really for him to keep on the case after he was canned. Some might see the dialogue as ""classic detective"" or ""witty"" but I found it really contrived, cliched, and tedious given the fact that ALL the characters talk the same way. The book's only saving grace is that it's cute and small, and if you're from the Bay Area it's kind of fun to read about some of the places mentioned in the book. Really a disappointing read, though."
1,Indulgent mess,"As with any avant-garde creative work, this one has created a coterie of fans who say: ""If you don't get it, then there's something wrong with you, because to someone who has reached my higher level of perception it's obviously brilliant."" Don't be bullied. Just because people can listen to something dozens of times, until the point that they've memorized the string of notes the way some kid memorizes the string of digits that make up pi, doesn't make it good; it just makes it familiar to them. But there's not much here worth investing so much time to internalize. Lots of noises. Lots of undeveloped ideas. (Notice how the positive reviews are stuck defining the supposed virtues of this CD according to what it isn't.) Experimental music is great but this experiment failed, except insofar as it helped lay the groundwork for the compelling Secret Chiefs 3 recordings that followed."
2,Don't bother,This is more like a warm-up belch than a fully realized album...theirsecond one is so much better it'll make you wonder if these are the same people...I'd definitely start with that one.
2,Useless compared to the other SC3 albums,"In a sentence, Get Book M, 2nd Grand Constitution/Bylaws and Book Of Horizons and skip this one because it is nothing usless noise. PERIOD."
2,Azz rock,"Plays out like a third rate Bungle/Secret Chiefs throwaway disc, at times a downright literal one. Too many types of undereducated spazz lead to nothing but unintentional awkward pity. But yes, there is enough derivative freakout spunk for meriting at least one headphone excursion for the rare moments they aren't solely intent on masturbatory microphonics."
1,"Unlistenable, period.","OK, I love a bizarre and interesting musical journey as much as the next person. But people, give me a break. I could make this record myself. Throwing together a bunch of random noises and sounds is not, I repeat NOT musically creative. On the contrary, it's quite lazy. I've heard enough of Trey Spruance's work to know that he has quite a lot of talent. Unfortunately, none of it shows on this record. While there are probably 3 or 4 tracks that could've been very good, had they been fleshed out a little more, this album is pretty much a waste of time. I've heard Mr. Bungle's music occassionally described as cartoonish, and that's fine. Because at least with Mr. Bungle, the cartoonish nature was balanced out by some actual musical compositions. Here that is just not the case at all. Bottom line...being daring and innovative is one thing. Being random and uninspired is another. This CD, I am sorry to say, falls squarely into the latter."
3,Bass strategies,"This book doesn't give many useful tips or techniques, it's more of a general approach to bass fishing. I would sum it up this way : ""...be prepared to experiment, there's always something better you can do when the bite is off""."
4,"Bass Fish'n in Central, West & South FL","A book for even non-experienced fisher persons; it provides both interesting well-weathered opinions, as well as detailed and basic information /insight, that despite my decades of seasoned on-the-job-fishing, was able to gleem things new: After browsing pages for only 15-20 minutes, the next day's fishing trip employed new tactics that instantly led to more bass! WoW. Guess goes to show it's true, we can always learn more."
2,Disappointed,"In browsing the jewelry section of amazon.com, I came across what appeared to be a great deal . . . this Floating Heart Pendant with Diamond by Samuel Jewelers. The online image looked lovely and the thought of a diamond and white-gold combination for under $50 was very appealing. I purchased the item. . . . I received the necklace earlier today and I must say, I am VERY disappointed with it. The piece is much smaller than I thought it would be -- diamond is practically invisible, the white-gold chain itself isn't at all elegant or eye-appealing, and because the chain is so delicate, thin, it makes it very difficult to put on and remove the necklace. Do not waste your money on this. Buy your girl/woman a dozen roses instead!"
5,Great Value,"I bought this pendant as a Valentine's Day gift for my girlfriend, and we are both very happy with it. It is small, but the item description is not inaccurate. Pay attention to the dimensions, make sure it's the size you want, and then buy it! The price is very reasonable. Most of what you'll pay for is the diamond, itself (which is worth $20-$25), and you can always buy another chain separately, if you want. It is a great buy for your loved one!"
2,Diamond pendant,"I purchased this for my 88 y.o. grandmother for Christmas...Came giftwrapped, so I didn't see the product till Christmas morning...I was quite disappointed. The diamond grade is poor, and the pendant is white gold, yet the chain is silver and is so fragile and small, that I nearly broke it when I took it out of the box for her. The clasp are so small, that she cant put it on herself....I bought a white gold chain that is bigger...looks great now."
2,"Item is great, seller is HORRIBLE.","Got this for my wife for Christmas and the item itself is very nice. There was a glitch with the Amazon site and a duplicate order was placed for the item from Samuels Jewelers and an item directly from Amazon.Amazon fixed the issue with their item right away.After making five attempts (both via email and voice mail) to contact Samuels Jewelers I got zero response and have STILL gotten no response at all.I had to refuse the order and only got a partial refund, I'm assuming it was partial because of shipping fees. I would contact the buyer about this but it seems pointless as they don't respond to their customers anyway."
1,don't buy,bought this for my wife and she got to wear it twice and the necklace broke. Fixed it and it broke again. It is very weak where the chain attaches to the hasp.
5,Beautiful.. for the right person,"I noticed the other reviews described it as tiny. It IS small, and the image would obviously magnify it to show more detail. The product specs are on dot; the pendant is exactly as described.A word about the packaging is appropriate here. The product went to my recipient with pilfer-proof packaging, and inside was a red box with a cream bow, accompanied by a rose with my gift note. Very impressive.Definitely recommended, if you like understated jewellery."
4,Good Value,The pendant is a little small but over all nice size diamond and good quality for the price.
4,Don't expect the angle,"The necklace is nice, though a bit smaller than you might think. I would like to point out, however, that you can NOT actually have it at the angle shown in the picture. The chain clasps are too big to allow it. in fact, contrary to one review, you can only hang it one way, which is ""straight,"" which is put in quotes because it actually still hangs at a slight angle due to the shape of the pendant. Actually, I lied, you can hang it sideways (not just angled, but SIDEWAYS) if you want, but...not really attractive in my opinion. It's a pity, because i thought the angle the picture showed was really nice, and although the straight is still nice, it is not AS nice."
2,Consigned to the bottom of my bookshelf,"1. Good coverage of SOAP2. Uses GLUE (acquired by webMethods since acquired Software AG), whichis no longer available. As a result, when it's time to test yourWeb Services, you are on your own.3. Author's web site is non-existent, so you can't email him to finderrata/ work arounds.My suggestion, buy a dfferent book (or if you like O'Reilly as I do,buy it used. At least you won't pay as much). I am usinganother O' Reilly book for SOAP Programming with Java."
2,Nothing Special,"This book came out from O'Reilly in Spring of 2002 about the same time they published Java Web Services. If these had been combined and editing together, they would have had a star book on their hands instead of two average books. I can't say anything particularly bad about this book, but nothing particularly good either. If you're getting started with Web Services using Java, this and the title above are both decent sources to get you going."
3,Out of date,This book is out of date. The SOAP standard part is fine but the Apache SOAP implemention sections not useable unless you are using Apache SOAP instead of moving on to AXIS.
2,FYI to Takeshi fans...,"Takeshi Kitano is in exactly two scenes in 'Tokyo Eyes,' both at the very end of the film. Only one of the scenes involvesdialogue."
3,"Well made, but be awareful of th extra space","I love the design of this product and the construction is quality. However, what the pictures don't show you is that the back support comes straight out more than the average futon, requiring more than a foot of seemingly empty space behind it. For a small room, as mine is, this is a problem. On the other hand, that support structure is solid for when the futon is open and the opening & closing mechanism was a revelation. Overall I really like the product, I just wish the advertising pictures had shown the back."
1,NOT EXACTLY METAL,"The look of the futon frame looks sleek and its inexpensive.. when you get the frame you notice its more then just inexpensive, its CHEAP.. and thats due to the wooden slats that are used for support.. the slats break easily. We werent happy that the frame wasnt as much medal as they had made it sound"
3,not too good if being used for a couch,i purchased two of these and only kept one. i have one in back guest bedroom and as long as you only use it as a bed it will work fine. if you trying using as a couch the plastic supports for the wood bracing will consistently split in two.
3,Really comes out far from the wall.,"This futon looks great, but it would have been good to know in advance that it is a ""wall-hugging"" futon, meaning that the legs extend far towards the back so that the futon does not need to be pulled out from the wall to open it up. The other reviews allude to this, but it really sticks out pretty far from the wall and takes up a lot of floor real estate. We actually ended up sawing off the rear portion of our legs and replacing them with verticle pieces so that the futon could sit back up against the wall when in the upright position, but this was obviously a lot of work. Doing this allowed us to move the futon back towards the wall by about 10 to 11 inches -- a substantial amount in a small room!"
4,The best futon I've ever had.,"This is a great futon frame.It's metal, has no arms, and is extremely comfortable. I have the Day Dreamer Luxe 6000 mattress, and I think it's a perfect match.The slats are made of wood.Some of my slats came broken, but the company replaced them free of charge.The reason this only gets four stars, instead of five, is because there isn't anything on the front side of the frame to keep the futon mattress from sliding off.However, it hasn't been much of a problem thanks to the way the wooden slats are.It would still be better to have the stoppers that you see on other, lower quality futon frames.I am very lucky to have this futon frame."
1,DO NOT BUY! KEEP LOOKING!,This product will decieve you! it has wood panels to sit on with no included cushion. These panels break very easy even when installed correctly! a work around i did was to just lay a piece of plywood across the frame which works but is terrible! just do the right thing and keep look amazon has plenty of products in this category dont settle for something that wont hold up for even a week.
4,Futon Slats,The futon slats are not that strong. If you put pressure on them they will break. =\ that's the only lame thing about this futon.Everything else seems to be very good.
1,Avoid,"I bought this on the high street yesterday and I'm taking it back today. The book is full of errors and I already wasted an hour debugging two of their examples. It's just unacceptable. Look at the code halfway down page 599. There are at least 4 showstopping bugs in just 9 lines of code.At the bottom of page 622 the reader is instructed to download the files for one project from <INSERT DOWNLOAD SITE HERE>. I guess they never got round to inserting it.This edition feels like an early draft of what might have been a decent volume, but I'm not paying this amount of money to have my time wasted.I'm a programmer - not a designer. I think that in the hands of anyone who doesn't know how to approach broken code and fix it, this book would likely cause a lot of frustration and dissuade them from continuing. Please avoid."
3,I can't give this book anymore than 3 stars,"There is good about this book and there is bad about this book. The good: This book has many examples and explains to the reader how to do lots of different things with flash. Take a look at the contents of the book and you will see that it covers a great deal.The bad: This book is full of mistakes. The editor should be fired for what he did with this book. One or two mistakes in a book is OK BUT this book has an average of 1 mistake per chapter and this is NOT acceptable in a professional book. My advice is: If you can find another Flash MX book that will cover all of the same topics as this one, then get it otherwise buy a USED copy of this book."
2,INCORRECT TUTORIAL,"I have just begun reading the book, and on the simplest example, there are incorrect steps. I know A LITTLE about the concepts used in Flash, so I was able to get around the tutorial, but I would not recommend this book. How are you to know what is right or wrong if you have never seen it before? It is obvioulsy hard to tell if a book is accurate until you have spent your money, so choose wisely!"
2,I am not sure what to expect:,"I purchased the book to learn about Flash from a beginners standpoint up to intermediate. Early into the book, I found errors in the steps for the tutorials. I am in the process of reading it through, but it is discouraging that steps are incorrect in even the simplest examples. Obviously, it is hard to tell if the tutorials are accurate until you have already spent your money. So, for those of you reading, maybe look elsewhere for accurate info!"
1,"shame, shame, shame... waste of time and money","i give this book(?) a minus 5-star rating...this book is waste of money. you would be well served elsewhere. examples are not finished. tutorials are not complete. its home-page is slow to download files...all and all, take my advice and spend your hard-earned money for another book.i wrote pizzi a few letters that were never replied properly.shame on all the people who have put this book ""together."" why they have bothered to do so is beyond me..."
2,Too many mistakes...,"I spent a good amount of time trying to get around the editorial mistakes in this book - one can even look at two diagrams (page 265, fig 10.16, 10.17) only to realize they are the same with a misplaced image. Did anyone proof this book? When I found a project (Advanced Interactivity Chapter, page 600) that was of particular importance to me, it abruptly ended after the intro and jumped to the next project. I thought this book would be great, but It just seems too much - weeding through this stuff and trying to second-guess the errors at the same time."
3,"Well written, lots of mistakes however","Overall I found this book to be well written and a good source of quick instruction. My major complaint would be that many of the examples have mistakes in them, some of which are significant. For instance, in one sample he tells you to insert a ""frame"" but he means to say ""keyframe"". It was a fairly obvious mistake but a newbie who follows the instructions verbatim may be left wondering why the sample doesn't work. I can let a few mistakes go, but the number of mistakes in this book is unacceptable, especially considering the $50 price tag. Still, this seems to be one of the better Flash Mx books out there."
1,"Did you say something, sorry i couldn't hear, I fell asleep.","Turok 2 is so BORING - sprawling sparse levels barely populated by the occasional annoying bad guy - the sniper weapons are a poorly executed add on , and the multiplayer option is one of the WORST i have ever played. I cant emphasize enough how dull this game is. ... its more fun playing it with the power turned OFF!The graphics are actually very nice. Textured skins and lovely scenery. Would do well as a landscape gardening game.Nice weapon sounds. Terrible music. What is it with Acclaim and terrible music?"
3,review,The book had some interesting things in it but overall was not as helpful as we had hoped. There were marinas not listed that we saw and some of the marinas that were in the book we couldn't find. It also failed to tell us that at one point there is a sharp turn that is not clearly marked at all. Thankfully there was another boat nearby that we could ask. We were glad to have the book but wish it was more acurate.
2,Too much for too little,"Found this to be fairly useless for traveling unless you are bored and just want to read about area attractions. Found the Skipper Bob books and Active Captain far more usefull tools.YMMV, no affiliation to any guide book or publisher"
3,"Beautiful singing, poor accent","This is an enjoyable disc featuring beautiful songs of the Belle Époque. Vinson Cole's tenor voice is well-suited to this repertoire and he exhibits a lovely line throughout. His pronunciation, however, leaves something to be desired."
1,Nano Tank from Hell,"You all think YOU have issues with the Nano Cube, ha , you haven't seen nothing yet. I got mine brand new, it took an hour to setup on the stand and fill with water, once i plugged in the lighting smoke and flames (no kidding) came out of the hood! Not only that the ballast also had smoke billowing from it, so don't talk to me about a rusty filter! That is nothing compared to the Nano from Hell! I have lost time, money and my sanity all do to this stupid tank. Oh wait, I forgot, the stand is just as bad because its the worst piece of furniture i have ever had the displeasure of trying to put together. This is the worst decision and investment we have made in all our aquarist years. Please notice that i am not allowed to rate less than 1 but this is a -------0."
3,"Beautiful tank, OK for saltwater with upgrades","My friend purchased this tank a few years ago and developed it for a saltwater tank. It can be tough to use for saltwater, but it is do-able. She made the required equipment upgrades (lighting, etc), and I believe later on the pump did have to be replaced. I am not aware that rust was an issue. It is a beautiful tank with a crystal clear view on three sides. We have noticed one problem: the fish are able to ""jump"" over the interior back wall, where they end up in the reservoir area with the pump. I've seen it happen a few times, and we have yet to resolve the issue. She keeps corals, red & blue legged hermit crabs, snails, clownfish, and a seahorse."
3,Be Warned: Best Suited For The Hardcore Wargamer,"The other reviewers are more articulate than I, so why am I bothering? Mostly because if you're reading this review, then you're probably interested in buying EF 2 and maybe already know something about it except the most important thing: will YOU enjoy EF 2? I think EF 2 is the sort of historical military game that usually only hardcore wargamers love: detailed unit statistics, complicated supply and movement restrictions, and so on. If you're not a veteran, this EF 2 is not likely to be as enjoyable. For one thing, it is sloooooow: waiting for the AI to make its moves can seem interminable. I find the drama greatly reduced (in comparison to games like Steel Panthers and Combat Mission) but far more distracting is the predictability of the AI with its inflexible attacks. You can learn to love EF 2 (I did) but it was work: ask yourself why you're playing..."
4,A good simulation in the classic style,"I wargame, alot, just ask my wife. TalonSoft's EFII is well worth the time and effort to learn. Thats right, effort. Like any well designed game there is a definite learning curve to mastering both the tactics particular to and the interface of the game. The interface is kind of clunky at times until you get used to it. The tactics are true to life (at least for a sim.) with the exception of the supply rules which just don't make sense for anything other than the largest scenarios. That being said, the game is awesome in its design and scope. Lots of beautifully done options are available so there is lots of replayability. Best of all, you don't choke to death on charts and tables like in TAHGC products unless you want to delve into the well done beefy manual. A great game for history or simulation buffs. Bravo Talonsoft!"
1,another failure,clumsy interface and a game sequence with opportunity fire of course it doesnt work nice sound and pretty graphics despicable computer opponent like 15 years ago computer does move straight forward some people sue microsoft maybe they should think about talonsoft
1,WTF?,I love Hungarian culture and language and thought this would be a great artsy movie- I was wrong. Being the kind of guy that tries to find hidden meaning in many things I was at a loss trying to figure out what this film was trying to say. In my opinion it is the worst independent film I've ever seen. The closest thing that I could squint my mind's eye at as to the meaning of the film was maybe they were trying to convey the danger of outsiders from a rural villager's point of view. But the film's view focuses in and out on random things and then it covers three different individuals and their tragedies in complete randomness and then the screen goes black. I just sat there waiting for more on something that might have tied the whole idea together not leave me there so confused but the screen just went black and it was the end.
4,Great stuff!,"My mom actually started using this a few weeks ago and has been going crazy about how wonderful these products are. So she bought me some :) I have been using it for about a week now - the first two days I noticed a pretty sizeable difference in the overall appearance of my face but not sure what it was exactly. Now after a few more days, I'm not seeing a giant difference, but I've also had a cold so I look a little rundown anyway. I am, breaking out on my chin, but the other reviewer said that it happened to her at first too. So I guess I'm doing my review a bit early in the game. I do have to say I like it better than Estee Lauder or Clinique, and near my mouth seemed a bit droopy before (I'm 40)and it seems lifted a bit. I'll have to post a follow-up later."
4,Great products/poor selling method,"Selling thru Amazon is in direct violation of Arbonne Policies & Procedures and your contract with them could be cancelled. These are very pure, high quality products you would do best to get direct from Arbonne or your Arbonne Rep. to ensure they're new and unused! With less then 1% preservatives, the products have expiration dates. Arbonne International will be contacting the Seller."
1,Minnesota,"Arbonne NutriMin C hydrating face wash is very expensive and does not work any better than other face wash, and watchout if you accidently get any in your eyes - it burns like crazy and lasts almost 24 hours. Will not buy again."
4,Good Overview,"This is my third book of Dave Hunter's that I've purchased, and it's certainly true to his style: sweeping the high spots with lots of detail thrown in and a guitar lover's thesaurus of adjectives to describe sounds in a way that would have Webster turning over in his grave. I've been absent from the music scene for a long time, so I got a lot of value out of this book as a way to catch up on the opportunities available for electronic modification, and I found the CD to be particularly helpful in putting real sounds behind all those descriptive phrases. It's also nice to know that all that stuff I loved but sold off so many years ago is now worth a small fortune. As usual, the editing is not perfect, but Dave always manages to put together an entertaining and informative read."
5,Interesting Read,"After many years of acoustic guitar work I'm moving in the other direction. I wanted to know more about the pedals companies and their philosophies so I could try those pedals out at the music store. Both the CD, which comes with the book, and the interviews were helpful in helping me gain an understanding of the material."
5,Excelent review,"Excelent review and fantastic work on history research, I think this book it's a must for all stompbox and gear fan."
3,Pedal reference more than in depth education,"I bought this hoping that it would explain the difference in how certain effects pedals achieve their sounds. Although there is a chapter in the book which outlines the basics of the different catagories of effects, it does not elaborate on the details of how they alter the signal. The majority of the book is a history of effects pedals, listing the popular products from various manufacturers as well as a list of famous pedal designers.I wanted to read about components on the inside of pedals and what each one does in depth. This book does not give you that."
2,"Lots of elegant phrasing; characters and story, DOA.","I have great difficulty understanding why this book has received such positive reviews. To me, it read like a very smart college student's first crack at a novel. Clean prose, impressive vocabulary, but without depth. I found the characters and situations to be flat and uninteresting. The main character is supposedly this very worldly, upper-crust pianist and I didn't believe it for a second. The whole thing fell flat. Read a few pages of the excerpt and see if you don't agree."
5,Superb performances,"Carol Rosenberger's superbly lyrical style and unhurried tempos are just right for the Romantic music presented on this CD. I have never heard Ms. Rosenberger play more robust music, such as Beethoven's Emperor Concerto, so I cannot comment on how well she performs such works. But I can say that I have never heard anyone perform short Romantic pieces -- such as those on this CD -- better than Carol Rosenberger does."
1,Worthless,Wanted to set-up my home theater. But the disc is not made to do that. It's a lame attempt 5.1 setup DON'T PAY MORE THAN 1 CENT FOR IT. Disc says it has 2-4-6 channel surround but the menu does not let you accsess it. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I THREW IT AWAY AFTER 10 MINUTES..
