5,Beware!!,"Please beware of this book! It is a very good book, BUT there are two exact books, the only difference being the title. I bought both of these books for my grandchildren, a boy and a girl, and was very disappointed to find out there were the same book. The titles are: Walter the Farting Dog Farts Again, and, Walter the Farting Dog, Trouble at the Yardsale."
1,Not funny...,"The first book, Walter, the Farting Dog, is hilarious. This book is not. Father sells the dog behind the kids' back, then lies about it and a clown confines Walter to a ""fart catcher"" and forces the dog to eat beans and blow up balloons to be used in crimes. There are so many ways this story could have been made more palatable - having Walter be stolen instead of sold would have been a good start. If you liked the first book, stick with that one and pass on this one."
4,My son loved it,"My son loves Walter. He is a typical boy and body noises and it just makes him laugh. He isn't a kid that likes to read, but with the Walter books he is willing sit down and read to me and actually enjoys it.I would recommend Walter the Farting Dog to anyone who likes a silly book that will make you and your children laugh. I am thankful for William Kotzwinkly to make this book geared towards boys and their silliness towards body noises. Because of you and this book series, by son is getting better at reading and is actually enjoying doing so."
2,teah yourself fSwahili complette course,i did larn a lot from this. but a bit frustratedtrying to find the written page sith the spoken cd. and think too much grammer given in a beginner's course. need just practie with hearing the basic phrases. grammer should be much later.
3,Teach yourself Swahili complete course package (book and 2CDs),"I use the book for swahili lessons given to adult french speakers who have basic notions of swahili. I find it useful for preparing my lessons, and I mostly use the dialogues during the lesson. The exercises are helpful too sometimes, but I wish there were more, or an accompanying activity book. The learners find the dialogues rather long with too much new vocabulary at a go. I don't use the CDs as I find them too simple compared with the level of the book, but I encourage the learners to listen to them at home.Overall, the approach is interesting and dynamic. One of my students recommended it, so I'd already seen the book before purchasing."
4,Teach Yourself Swahili,"I have had this set for about a week. I am amazed at how many Swahili words I already know. Mostly from TV and movies like Tarzan with Jonny Weissmuller and Lion King. You hear a word and get a general idea of what it means.I like the way the book is set up. The CDs are great to hear the language, but you really need to work with the book at the same time. I wish the set had a third CD that was basically a dictionary: English to Swahili or Swahili to English to be able to hear and memorize individual words.I am a little confused at the moment, but I think it will get easier as I go through it. Not having anyone to speak to at the moment is a drawback. I have 10 months before my church mission so I am sure I will be confident if not proficient in that time. I like to learn about the places where I am going. England has been my most difficult place to visit so far.This set is worth the time and a lot cheaper than other programs."
4,Practical verification,I've tried to learn some swahili prior to my trip to Kenya and Tanzania. It is quite hard. But the book is hepful. Many thanks.
4,No passive learning in your car,"This is a very thorough course - goes well beyond a phrasebook, and the CD is only worthwhile if you read along and do the exercises. So, no passive learning by listening over and over on your commute.So, for a quick course in airport and hotel Swahili, choose something else. For a working knowledge of the language, this is perfect."
5,Swahili,"This course is excellent. From the very outset it was teaching me vital communication skills for Swahili, and my Swahili friends are impressed how well I am speaking their language already. For the price, this course is excellent!"
4,very thorough!,"i liked this book. it wasn't quite as ""simple"" as the info suggested- but it was very thorough and i found myself learning swahili despite being more complicated than i had anticipated. it was broken up into easy to follow sections and there are lessons at the end of each section to do with answers in the back and that was helpful, too. the CD was nice for pronunciation clarification."
4,"Great mix, unless you're wedded to the album versions","This is a good overview of the Williams/Spielberg music up to 1990, but the performances are often a bit different from the various soundtrack album versions. If like me, you've heard those so many times that they're a part of you, you may find these performances jarring. They may even be better, some feel so, but they're just not the same. Stil, the album is worth having if only because it contains the only commercially available music from The Sugarland Express."
5,very good book,thank you so much for the book it was exactly as describe or better. This book that i received was almost new and it came quick within a few days the book was here I would recommend this seller to anyone thank you for being honest.
3,A good guide for most trainers,I found this book to be a useful reference for me in terms of adding some activities to the training routines that I regularly deliver.The author is obviously a very experienced trainer and I have been able to easily take some of the techniques and integrate them immediately.Some of the information is really only suitable to certain training environments within certain disciplines and I have had to avoid them as I find them a bit questionable from a credibility point of view. Some also do have the effect of forcing people who do not like interacting to be interactive. (Always an uncomfortable thing to watch)All in all this is a good book and I would recommend it for people who are beginning in training as well as for those who are looking for a few areas that they can use to revitalise their older training routines.
5,Full of practical ideas,It is a practical book based on sound theoretical ideas. Useful for the busy trainer who wants to use new techniques almost immediately. A must book for every trainer.
2,Disappointing...,"The basic take-off point of the tale seems to be the machinations and ambitions of Anna Comnenus, the Byzantine princess who celebrated her father, the Emperor Alexius, in her well-known text, The Alexiad, itself a rather dry though intriguing document of the political twists & turns and military escapades undertaken by the Byzantine Greeks of that time. The promise of it all was great. But not so, the execution. There are elements of intrigue and fantasy and adventure here but they are not well meshed. Some of the characters were promising and I did like the attempt to depict the life of the Byzantines on their wharfs and in their palaces. But the mixing of pagan deities with the real world of religious Byzantium just didn't work for me. Although I like this kind of stuff, I put this one down about half way through -- though I tried mightily to see it through to the end. But I failed. And so, regrettably, did this book. -- SWM"
4,A Force Of Nature,"Churchill was such an interesting and complex man that I do not believe any short book can adequately capture the full Force of Nature that was Churchill. Not only was Churchill a politician and great war leader in World War 2, but he also participated in 5 wars beginning with the 1898 Battle of Omdurman where he was a part of the last great Cavalry charge in British history. If all of that wasn't enough, he has had more words published than Charles Dickens.This book does a decent job of introducing Churchill to those new to him. If this book whets your appetite to learn more of Churchill then by all means read the biographies penned by William Manchester, Roy Jenkins, and Martin Gilbert. Churchill's own writings also give great insight into the man. I especially enjoyed his ""World War 2, The Gathering Storm."""
3,Needs punctuation. Needs an editor.,Clearly a British author. Clearly someone with no use for punctuation.I'm so accustomed to setting off participle phrases with commas that I find myself continually re-reading sentences and paragraphs to clarify meaning. Very annoying.Is this typical for contemporary British authors?
1,Should be Story of Jesus Painting,"More than two thirds of the book is dedicated to paintings related with Christianity. And the real arts are either completely ignored or dealt carelessly. For example, The whole Van Gogh's paintings are described in mere four pages, while each of so may Christian related paintings by some obscure painters, is shown using four split pages. If your religion is Christianity and your objective is to investigate Christian paintings, this book should be fine. But for the rest of us who are not Christians, this book is not worth reading or looking at. There are so many other good art books out there without religious bias. This book is not about painting as described. It is about the Christianity religion disguised with ""Painting""."
2,Myself I Sing,"I found these poems self-involved and lax. Somewhere the obvious surface meanings of the poems and the unfathomable depths she thinks she's approaching, Ms. Lux might aim for some simple human truths based on experience."
4,great collection,"Adrienne Rich describes Dorianne Laux's poetry as 'tough, sensual...with physical details that add up to more than their sum...' It's what I like about Laux's poetry, she is sensual, sexual at the same time a tough woman. Her poetry is much like Kim Addonizio's, who is one of my favorite contemporary poets. And they are friends, so it is no surprise that Addonizio has lead me to Laux. Dorianne's poems range from poems about the innocence of childhood to the raw, sexual poems that close the volume. Dorianne Laux writes the kind of poetry that I love to read. I highly recommend her work, especially if you are a fan of Millay, Addonizio, Kate Light, or April Lindner."
5,American Classics-Barber : Solo Piano Music / Daniel Pollack,"This illuminating and sensuous pianism evident even in the most resounding fortissimos,making virile a discourse that is all too often watered down, prodigious pianism of fiery energy,of dynamic articulation,elan,and fullness---that dominates and towers over the competition from now on--and constitutes the disc that most approaches Barber's piano music and becomes as well, a summation and an event."
3,Flavorful,"I like a couple kinds, but not the others. Turns out that I only like about half of the flavors. The ones I don't enjoy are the fruity ones, not my style. However, the others I plan to buy individual boxes of in the future."
5,Excellent collection of premium teas,Being able to sample different tea flavors is great. I have been enjoying the tea and will order again.
4,good tea,Overall I enjoyed this sampler of green teas. I will say that the pomegranate raspberry is not to my taste--but that's a good reason to start out with a sampler.
2,Poor quality DVD,"I was looking forward to viewing the Broadway show ""Top Banana"" on DVD because I had missed it at live theatre. What a disappointing DVD. The sound and visual quality was poor, and some premiere songs were left out. This was supposedly recorded from the stage version, but when the actors took their bows, there was no audience applause, which was eery. Whom were they bowing to? All in all, a waste of money. Saw it once and gave it to the charity pile."
5,History comes alive,"This is a fantastic coffe table book that I actually read from cover to cover. Of course, it's mostly photographs, so it wasn't too hard to do, but still. The author has collected old photographs of New Mexico, most of them from the 19th century, and then took photos of the same scenes as they look today. The captions explain a little history of the old photo, and interesting comments about how the new photo was taken. In some cases the old buildings are still standing, and in others there is no longer any trace that the buildings or entire towns even existed. The new photos are very high quality, and the printing of the book is top notch. If you have any interest in New Mexican history or the state's scenic wonders, this is a must have."
4,Skygods Review,Very engaging. Written so well you don't realize you're reading a book about the airline industry.
5,Excellent story,"It was easy for me to relate with this book since I work in the airlines. A co-worker recommended it to me, and it was well worth the read. Sky Gods is a great mix of story telling and history, ranging from the Clipper days to the eventual falter of Pan Am. A great book for people interested in the airlines."
4,"Not done with it yet, but interesting.","Good, relatively quick read on the rise and fall of Pan Am. I'd recommend it for anyone who has a fascination with the airline industry."
4,Sigh!!,"For those of interested in aviation, its history, people and machines, this is a tough, but necessary read. The story of Pan-Am is the story of American civil aviation, or one of them............a good vread."
5,Wonderful Read,If your an airline buff or just an old time fan of Pan Am this book is a wonderful read. So well written and it gives a great historic account of one of the worlds greatest airlines !
5,Best Book Ever! I couldn't put it down,This is one of the best books I have read in years. This is the type of book you can't put down. I brought me back to a time when it was fun to fly. I have read this book for a second time and picked up so much more. Thanks for capturing a piece of history! Book makes me wish I could have flown Pan Am. THANKS!!!!!!!
5,Must Read if You.... Remember the Big Blue Ball,"This was a terrific look at (arguably) an icon - long gone from the skies. But, say what you will, Pan Am (and Juan Trippe) defined modern aviation.... This is an authoritative, incisive, and ultimately, poignant look at the history and corporate culture of Pan Am - and its ""Sky Gods"". Don't hesitate - buy it."
4,A Palette Musically,"Anjali, what a great name, sounds delicious like lemon jelly...hmmm, even her name reminds me of chill-out music. `Anjali' is her first proper album, before that, the release of `Sheer Witchery' raised the eyebrows of many artists/DJ and critics alike. Listen to this gorgeous album to find out why. The first single `Lazy Lagoon' would have been such a chill-out classic if it gets enough radio airplay. It is so much exquisite and intricate than that insipid chill-out `anthem' of 1999, `At the River'. The rest of the album is not really as catchy as `Lazy Lagoon', maybe it is because of her Indian origin, her taste remains eclectic. There are just so many ideas on the album that you gotta regurgitate before you can fully digest them. A very diverse album that is worthy of anyone's attention."
3,Anjali - Anjali,"Anjali's self-titled debut rests mostly on her sultry, whispered vocals and her knack for making lounge-ready exotica. The opener, ""Lazy Lagoon,"" encapsulates this perfectly, from its string introduction to the harp and horns accompaniment to her sighs. ""Arabian Queen"" piles on the percussion thickly with a decidedly wastern shoo-be-do chorus thrown in there for sheer cheekiness, while ""Strawberry Mousse"" opts for some 70s-style funk with the dreaminess. ""Nebula"" drops in a kick drum for a deep house tip, but ""Kulu"" brings back the tiki torches and grass skirts. ""Kali Came"" ends on with the twang of a steel guitar, showing that Anjali's interest in expanding boundaries is stronger than her interesting in staying within them."
3,Great racks but NOT made in the USA,Just like someone else said ... I ordered these cooling racks specifically because NordicWare cookware is made in the USA as stated on their website. I was pretty upset upon receiving these to see they're made in Taiwan. They'll work well and are made well but I'm trying to purchase as much as I can from the USA not Taiwan/China etc.
2,The ice does crack...,"I bought this CD with an aural image of the young Baltsa in Mozart and Rossini in my mind. It turns out that was the wrong thing to do. Baltsa never had a full integration of her lower and higher registers, and the breaks between the two are especially noticable here. It becomes especially apparent in coloratura runs that circle around this area of her voice. The singing tends to be effortful, and she really has no business singing ""Bel raggio lusinghier"" when she ducks all the high notes and omits a decent cadenza. Coloratura, contrary to my expectations, too often sounds laboured. Occasionally though, you get a glimpse of Bltsa the great Rossinian, with some intelligent musical insights and rythmic touches. On the whole however, you're far better off with Podles, Horne, Kasarova and Larmore, all of whom have produced Rossini discs of far greater distinction..."
4,Absolutely worth while!,"The first time I heard this CD, I could not help wondering when I would hear Baltsa produce some dreadful sound on it. In other words, I felt she was walking on very thin ice. Well, she did not produce any horrible sounds so I managed to listen to the CD more relaxed the second time and have since then played this disc over and over again. Eventhough some people may feel that Rossini should be sung with more 'finesse', if that is the right word, Baltsa approaches each aria on this CD well-thought, intelligently and - most important - without making a showcase of the arias, as so many singers do with Rossini. The Maometto aria is a pure gem! But I guess as is always the case with Baltsa, you either like her, or you don't, there's no inbetween."
1,Vocally disastrous,"I listened to this disc in horror. The break in the middle of Baltsa's once-magnificent voice was so huge at the time of this recording that I had a mental image of her attempting to leap across the Grand Canyon, (vocally speaking). Surely she must have been in tears to hear her amazingly wide range now in two separate and separated pieces. How could she have permitted this disc to be released??? Sic transit gloria mundi."
1,the 1980's fashion sourcebooks,"I expected more normal everyday fashions of the 8o's to help remind me of what I wore to costume a play. very little pictures, nothing usable for me. The written information was enjoyable reading and helped jogged my memory, but I wanted pictures."
1,Awful Smell-Bad Reaction-DONT BUY,"There are lots of bad things I can say about this product but I'll cut to the chase. It smelled terrible. I opened it up to put some on my skin just so I could smell it & my hand instantly started breaking out in hives! That has never happened to me before. I've never been allergic to anything in my life or had a reaction like that from a product (I've tried a lot of different products, food etc.). I also thought it was an oil not the thick cream that it turned out to be. Worst of all the bad smell is hard to get rid of. I just washed my hands and I can still smell it. Anyways, I will more than likely throw this away if I cant find anything else to use it for which I doubt I will. I definitely wont give this away to someone.Also, It doesn't tell you in the description but I think its imported from India. It had a lot of their language on it."
3,"Yoga, Youth and Reincarnation","This book is great for the yoga positions & breathing. The philosophy expoused, I could do without; it's utter nonsence. If you are looking for great Hatha Yoga, with good explanations, this is a great book. Otherwise, forget it."
5,Excellent resource,"This is the type of book you want to own if you are involved with design. It's great for those times when you need to create something that relates to this school of design - it is also pure inspiration. Surprisingly for a design book, this comes with a text part that contains a refresher on Japanese design.Geetesh Bajaj/Indezine.com"
3,A Grammar of Japanese Ornament and Design,Not what I was looking for. Viewing the inside of book on-line looked like it had a lot of pictures and designs which is what I wanted but it only has a few. Disapointed.
5,Powerful experience,"I have found this guided meditation, and others by Jeanie Marshall, to be the best on the market. Her high consciousness is evident throughout this guided meditation. While it is certainly appropriate for a beginner, I am definitely not a beginner, and I would and do use this and others by Jeanie anytime and frequently. There is a depth in her voice that carries a healing quality that is far beyond the words spoken.Some people only listen to words, but I have found with this guided meditation that the silence on disc 2 and the music on disc 1 are also impactful. I meditate on my own, but I meditate more deeply with Jeanie's guidance.Because this meditation is relatively short, I can easily fit it into my very busy schedule as a sales manager. If I feel the need to spend more time, I listen again. Most of the time, though, I feel fully replenished in the 20 or so minutes. I recommend this to anyone who wants to feel supported and loved."
4,"If you need to relax, you need this!","When you listen to the voice of Jeanie Marshall you can't help but feel relaxed. I have never been one to meditate but with these guided meditionation CD's, it is so easy. I found these to be very focused, which I thought was a big point. Each CD comes with 2 discs, one with music and one without. I personally prefer the one with music, it was very soothing. Listening to Jeanie tell you how important, special and unique you are, it can only make you feel good. Even if you have never meditated before, like me, you will find yourself listening to these CD's again and again. When you need some balance in your life, or just want to relax or feel better about yourself and your life, these are the tools for you."
5,Jeanie Speaks to the Heart of Me,"I have been on 'the path' for many, many years and have come to believe and trust in many things: my higher self, my Creator, the Tao, among others. As I seek ways to market my new book, ""California Healthy,"" I enjoy connecting with 'all that is' through guided mediations. This morning as I listened to Jeanie's cd of ""Balance the Energies"" I realized her voice was speaking directly into the center of me and all that I hold sacred, empowering me on many levels. I set my intent during this meditation and have been happily busy since, smoothly following that intent. Thank you, Jeanie, for this beautiful offering to me and all others. I heartily recommend it."
5,Thank You Joel Dorn!,"Joel Dorn was a DJ in his early days in PA and it sure shows in this compilation, he has picked put a great 3 disc program for us to listen to.This is OOP now, pick one up while you still can, hidden gems here!"
4,This book does a good well with typical teen problem issues.,"In this book, Thesman puts together several elements that should appeal to teen readers (I'm a Language Arts teacher, grade 7). Keller has serious asthma, and this has caused her to withdraw from people. Two boys, one a ghost, teach her to trust people and be more open with other people. The ""ghost"" is an especially interesting character. In the end, Keller is a much happier person, even though she still has serious health problems."
2,"This book was okay, but I would not recomend it.","I think this book had an interesting plot, but it was a bit too simple. I am 14 and I found the book to be at a much lower level, I had to read it for school and I was surprised they would put it on a ninth grade reading list. If I had read it 3 years ago I think it would've been a lot more interesting and enjoyable."
2,"Great Idea, not convincingly written...","The author took a wonderful idea (Geography as a factor in growth) and extensive research, and combined them into a book that would have done better as individual articles. The data was extensive, but the structure of the book did not make for a comprehensive read, and left me (as a reader) without a clean understanding of the authors point. A wonderful idea, but a bit hard to trudge through."
3,Much Larger Than the 0-3 or 0-6 months Size! :(,"I bought these to replace some 0-3 and 0-6 month Avent pacifiers. I bought six, anticipating throwing out all the old ones. Once I opened the package however, I realized the nipple part is MUCH larger than the smaller sizes. Our daughter hates them! Maybe she will learn to like them later, as for now I have to go back and buy several more in the smaller size. The other ""issue"" I have with these type pacifiers is that water gets in through the sides during washing. Water/soap/crud builds up inside the nipple and it's impossible to get out. Steaming these pacifiers is a much better option, rather than washing them in the sink or dishwasher. Avent recommends replacing these every four weeks, so I guess it wouldn't be that big an issue if you followed their suggestion. I see no point in replacing a pacifier that is still perfectly good, though!"
2,Not worth it,"These pacifiers were a pain!! The nipple was too small for my sons mouth, even though he was in the recommended age group. The cut out for the nose is too high and was always rubbing him. The plastic surrounding the nipple is flat and hard, not curved to fit the face at all and my son hated that. Also, the plastic outside and ring are hard plastic, so when it would fall out of his mouth at night it would wake him up. Not worth the money."
3,not the best,"We used these pacifiers for my son and I wasn't thrilled. I would steam them to dissinfect them, and they always left moisture inside the pacifier that I could not get out. The moisture would then turn into a creamy colored mold. I had to keep buying new ones, because by the time I realized this, my son was already used to these pacifiers. I won't be using them for my next child."
4,Love Denver Junior League Cookbooks!,"Although not as good as 'Creme de Colorado' and 'Colorado Cache', my favorites, I wouldn't miss any of the Colorado Junior League Cookbooks!I'm always looking to see if I have missed any!"
5,Fabulously Delicious and Easy!,"I am literally buying this for my entire family. Not only are these recipes easy to prepare (and buy for; how many times do you buy a fancy cookbook only to discover that you can't find half the ingredients??) but the recipes are really delicious. My faves so far are the Bleu Cheese Quesadillas with Pear Salsa, the Montrachet Spread, and the Sweetheart Straws, but I've just started delving into this amazing book. I'm going to work my way through all the recipes! Does anything sound better than Autumn Pumpkin Gnocchi with Butter Thyme Sauce? Yummy! Check out the picture for the Beef and Pepper Bundles; that's the one all my coworkers were making hungry noises for. I'd feel great using this book for entertaining or for making meals for the family."
4,Something is Missing,"With the recent gift of Colorado Colore I now have all four of the Colorado Cookbooks put out by the Junior League of Denver. And they are by far the best cookbooks I have ever used!However, something is missing from Colorado Colore. The letters ""I"", ""J"", ""Q"", and ""R"" are not included in the index. One of the menu suggestions in the book includes Rice Pilaf with Mangoes. Since there is no ""R"" you cannot find the recipe- UNLESS you look under Mangoes. Of course.I spoke with the publisher of the book and was told it was intentional- at the discretion of the editor. Seems odd to me.I would have rated this book a 5-star if it were not for the index. In the meantime, it offers a good opportunity for sleuthing and problem solving."
2,Poorly Written,"I'm surprised this was actually published. Not only do the stories have improper sentence structure, but they read like a bunch of college-level essays; Blackett gives little character development, little description, and even less substance. Absolutely no redeeming qualities in this work, not even in its ideological conceptions.A waste of money."
5,This is burning.,"This is not the sort of album where a young lion tries to convince you that they are well versed in all the various styles, and the history, of jazz. Rather, this album is created from a singular voice and vision. This is not to say that Rudresh has not studied the masters -- he clearly has. But Rudi's sound is all is own. His technique is burning. His tunes are indsidiously infective. His ideas are endless. His sound is huge and confident. He is compared to Ornette and to Coltrane and to Steve Coleman and to Bird, but I don't think he sounds like any of those guys. He sounds like Alan Holdsworth on saxophone. Or if Tony Williams played saxaphone, he'd probably sound a lot like Rudi.Burning. Definitely burning. And I'm not just saying that because he's my friend. But someone had to review this great disc.Check it out. And check out ......END"
5,Great record,This record is a fine example of modern jazz music. The writing is fresh and the musicians are used in a variety of combinations. All of the players excel but the alto and bass have to be singled out for having particularly strong solo voices.
4,redheads,This is an amazing book the photograph is captivating in all sense of the word. Especially the 3 page fold out of an entire red headed family on the beach.I knew I needed this book for my own facination with redheads which strangley enough is one of my goals to marry one.The entire book has some very interesting people from other continents. Such beautiful women and men as well.this book is a mild plus.
4,efficient,I use this product before working out. it has been really efficient as far as fat and water weight loss. Make sure you eat something after taking it (about 30 min). if your stomach is empty you won't feel too good.
5,Good Toys,"My wife, a teacher, was amazed at the color and quality of these animals. These are for a play-diorama for my grandson, and will stand up to many play hours. They appear to be indestructible and are high-quality reproductions."
4,Good Quality not high quality,"These are medium large light plastic animals. They are good for small hands like my 20 month old. I purchased these animals and most of the other sets by this maker for education with my son. These are good for that. Most of the animals have marks from the process of making the animals. On one of the animals, the paint has a run in it. Some of the legs are not the same length so they do not stand up straight.I give this 4 stars because they are good for what I wanted them for, but don't expect to put them on display. I think these are designed to hold up to toddlers."
2,Frankenstien Jungle Animals,"I agree with another person who reviewed, about the quality of these animals. I too purchased 4 of these sets for my daughter and nephew, I was disappointed. The Jungle animals look like they have been cut into slices and then welded together? The kids point it out everytime. I was hoping that at such a steep price they would be of a thicker heavier material and of better quality. And I also have fear about the paint being lead based. The other sets look a little better. I will do better research next time. All in all the kids play with these and do enjoy them."
3,Durable animals,I purchased these jungle animals for my one year old grandson for Xmas. They are a little too big for a one year old in my opinion. These animals are more suitable for a toddler around age 3. He does love them and tries to make the sounds of the animal.
5,Gift for my granddaughter.,"She really loved this animals. She now knows the names and the colors. The large size makes it difficult to put the whole animal in her mouth, which is good. I suggest that you wash these before giving them to a youngster as they will try to put them in their mount anyway."
5,A BIG hit.,This was a gift for a 2 yr. old. The larger size was great. Would definitely recommend along with the zoo animals.
4,Carrying Case,"This carrying case is for the most part pretty great, however one of the straps has already broken and I don't even use it everyday. Its kinda ridiculous, but for what I paid for it I guess I can't really complain. A friend of mine bought the same one though, and one of her straps is tearing off completely and she's only had it since the end of September. Just be careful with it."
2,Oversized and Backpack straps break,"This was a gift for me to use for graduate school. After two months of use the clamp for the shoulder strap broke while I was riding my bike home. I promptly got a new one in the mail from the company (the lifetime warranty works well), but the new one broke in the same spot within two days of use. I also found that it was extremely wide, every time I walked in a doorway the backpack would hit the side of the door. I'll be looking for something else for next quarter."
4,Great bag,Great bag. Lots of room. What you see in the pic is what you get. Don't know why there is a zipper from the front flap into the main compartment though. enjoy.
4,"Well-appointed, well-made, very versatile","I just received this bag today. I was quite pleased with all the storage and organizer pockets it has. I really like the fact that it converts from a satchel to backpack configuration (haven't tried it yet - I understand the backpack clips have a breaking problem?) It fits a Toshiba Satellite with a 15.4"" screen perfectly. A very well-made bag and I highly recommend it."
5,Wonderful buy and bag,"I love this bag!! It is attractive, spacious, versatile and inexpensive. What more could you want? It has enough space to even fit a couple of binders or books and it also has plenty of compartments so that you can stash your belongings and keep organized! It also was delivered very promptly like the next day or the day after even though I selected regular parcel service! I am very pleased with the bag and service."
3,"Very good when not broken, but backpack straps break frequently","It's really great when it's not broken. Easy to carry, you can tuck backpack straps away when you don't want them, fits easily under seat in airplane. However, the straps have broken several times in a year. I've gotten I think 4 or 5 replacements. So beware!"
3,The corners tear.... Watch out!,"At first I was delighted with this bag. It fared well on a recent flight and easily held my things plus computer accessories. My job, however deals with alot of moving from one vehicle to another, and the bag tore at one of the lower corners exposing the inner contents. I estimate it lasted about 6 months. So if you need a bag that will handle alot of jossling about this one is not the bag for you."
3,Great until the backpack clips break,"I have to echo the review above.I'm still using this with the shoulder strap but the clips that hold thebackpack straps broke after a couple of months use. On the upside, the Macbook wasn't harmed when the breaking clip caused me to drop the bag.I carry a full load around and would have been happy if only the attachments had been metal rather than plastic."
4,Hmmm...,"The prices being asked for Steve's books, this one and *Master Spades*, are grossly inflated. Go to his website (google Master Spades)and buy them separately, or for the combined price of $25.00."
2,"Interesting, but not that great!","This book has some pretty decent parts. I never knew anything about the origins of the game. The bidding section is good. Duplicate sounds like a real good variation.However, this book is just too long, and of limited value to the new - intermediate player. Steve is very long-winded in his explanations of hands. The chapter on Nils is worthless. Defensive play is scantily covered. If you have a lot of time on your hands, or your computer is broken, by all means by this book. Otherwise, save your money...."
5,Aida's last chance,"The sad thing about this recording is that it's probably the last chance Aida will have to be recorded with the right kind of voices for many, many years. Aprile Millo sang an unforgettable Aida at the Met in 1989, and so she does here, with true spinto sound. Of course we could all name better Aidas: Milanov, Price, Caballe and the young Tebaldi, but it's undeniable that Millo is their peer. Domingo in his fourth recording as Radames is still in good form, if inevitably, time has taken some of the brilliance of yore. Zajick is an imposing Amneris, but I especially loved James Morrias as Amonasro. Listening to Millo and Morris in their third act duet, is like having Milanov and Warren together again...and in digital sound! Levine is not as idiomatic as Abbado in Verdi, but he does a good job. If you want Aida in digital sound, this HAS to be it."
3,Okay recording...,"If you have to have digital sound, then you might want to explore this recording. Otherwise, there are other more successful aidas out there. I didn't feel like this performance was spirited enough. Levine's conducting was good, but not outstanding. I was disappointed by the way they handled the Triumphal March...Domingo, of course, delivers a fine performance. If you already have a complete Aida, you may want to buy the highlights cd instead of this complete recording."
4,I love the Corr's,Yet more music from my favorite peopleso what can I say but that I love themand their music. I recommend them toone and all.
4,Combining Traditional Sounds with Modern Pop,"""Angel"" is a fine pop-song by Irish Corrs. Great catchy melody, strong vocals and a fine violin break, produced in modern pop-style.The acoustic version is also nice."
1,If you are paying more than $2.00 then your getting robbed,"If you are paying more than $2.00 for a pack of 5 of these, or more than $10-$12 for 100, you are totally getting ripped off. PLEASE dont do it. Look at the Astra's or the Derby extra's. You can literally get just as good of a shave, just as great a feel, and 100 blades for less than half of the price on this ad of 21.43..."
4,"Good, not great","Pretty happy with these blades. They remind me of Sharks or Dorcos. Unfortunately, these blades are considerably cheaper than the Wilkinsons."
5,"Always quaility, always worth the price.","I've been using Wilkinson razors since 1967 and only stopped when I broke my old safety razor.Found the very nice Parker butterfly on Amazon and bought this size pack for the price and to have enough on hand (Can't be found locally.)These blades rate alongside of their competitor blade in giving a close, smooth shave without the burn and redness that the new multi-blade razors tend to leave.And the price is much, much lower. I have a course, heavy beard and I can get about 5 or 6 shaves per blade.I only get about three or four with the top of the line multi-blade.If you're considering a switch, it may take a few weeks to adjust but I think you'll find it worth the effort.Okay, I'm old school and I don't like shaving with a razor that looks like it could beam Spock aboard, but the bottom line is comfort and price and less to go into the land fill."
4,"Cute, very durable, takes elbow grease to clean","I bought this to put on my key chain almost 9 years ago (I was in a Fruits Basket phase). I had it on my keys for almost a year before I took it off since it looked so dirty. The plastic seems foggy clear, but quickly turns a greyish/brown over time with wear and tear. I did try to wash it, granted briefly, with little success. The cat face held up very well, and never came off with all my tugging and pulling. Over all, it was pretty durable, in comparison to a lot of other key chains. No breakage of any sort, it just got super dirty."
5,"TALLIS: Spem in Alium, Lamentations & More - Pro Cantione","TALLIS: Spem in Alium, Lamentations & More - Pro Cantione~ Mark Brown is a splendid and sublime recording. Listening to Tallis is truly a majestic and magnificent experiencing. Being a very devout person I feel that his music speaks into my heart, nay, my soul and I rejoice to hear such praise given towards God. The voices truly sound like a chorus of angels and Tallis amazing and breathtaking masterwork Spem in Allum can without a doubt nor a reservation be said to be one of the finest works ever written in the choral music tradition. This recording per se is very well produced and the sound is impeccable. The liner notes are very well written and the cover art is a splendorous and marvelous painting of Christ kneeling in prayer. I would without any reservations whatsoever highly recommend this album and I therefore give it 5 out of 5 stars."
2,Too biased on 2nd & 10th Amendments,"I am using this book for my 6th grader in our study of the Bill of Rights. The coverage of the 1st Amendment I thought was pretty good, with a good history of judicial decisions. However, when I got to the 2nd Amendment, I found it to be pure anti-gun propoganda with no appreciation or knowledge of the founders' purpose for putting it there. I found some good material for kids on the 2nd Amendment on the NRA web site.The coverage of the rest of the Amendments is pretty good, except the 10th. Here again we see an anti-federalism interpretation which disturbs me. The authors write as if it is a mystery what we should delegate to the states. Then ch. 13 is entitled, ""Madison's most valuable amendment,"" the one that didn't get included. Well, this is what Madison argued, but obviously the others in Congress didn't agree for federalist reasons. If you are going to use this book, find other sources on the 2nd and 10th."
2,Presents a liberal viewpoint,"If you are looking for a liberal viewpoint to present to a child, you may be pleased with this book. However, if you are looking for a different viewpoint, or, my choice, a book with no slant to it, but rather one that presents an unbiased look at all major sides, then you should look elsewhere."
1,roadside history of nebraska,"I began this book with interest but that changed quickly as I realized I could not trust the information it contained. We live on the site of the Print Olive ranch mentioned in the book. Candy Moulton states it is beside the Dismal river, which it is not. The Dismal is over 65 miles away. The old Print Olive ranch is on the South Loup River. I look out my window at it daily. If Ms. Moulton could not even check the river's name on a map, how can we trust the information she includes which is unverifiable. Very disappointing!"
5,cosmic soup for the soul !,"Tchiya's music is regularly featured on my online radio station ""Acoustic Paradise"" that broadcasts via live365.com.Beautiful voice, catchy rhythms, lyrics that will blow your mind ! JUST ADD HEADPHONES !"
4,Great Introduction To Living With Animals For Kids,"I read this book before giving it to my 10 year old niece for Christmas. I thought the book was fabulous, talking about how animals communicate with us and how to understand their behaviors. The author explains the value and mechanics of developing richer relationships with animals in ways that kids can understand. The author's attitude is open and trusting with animals, and is exactly the kind of attitude I wanted to foster within my budding vet-to-be-niece."
4,This is Wonderful Stuff,"If you remember the Wonder Stuff and wonder what Miles Hunt has done since, here is a great sampling. If you have never heard of Miles, but are looking for some good, heartfelt acoustic music, you found it. Not as good as seeing Miles on tour, but a good substitute during the times he is not touring."
4,Wonderful acoustic stuff,"Yep, a lot of Wonder Stuff tunes on here done in a live acoustic setting -- and they all work. Some renditions of b-sides that never quite got their due, but shine with this arrangement. An excellent CD for any Miles Hunt/Wonder Stuff fan. Surprisingly better than most ""unplugged"" sets."
3,miles looses the stuff,"well he not only looses the stuff but i think he lost most of the electricity too. seems as if his age is showing, the record is slower than tradional wonder stuff music, it's not bad, mind you, but i favor the full blown rock out aspect that i know miles can still deviver."
5,Found Money,A well written book which I enjoyed from beginning to end. I have read several of Grippando's books and each was informative as well as entertaining.
5,AS ATMOSPHERIC AND SHUDDERY AS THEY COME,"A perfect book to read during this autumnal season, the John Silence stories, first published in book form in 1908, are as atmospheric and scary as they come. Silence is a sort of early-20th-century ghostbuster, for want of a better term; a doctor of the supernatural; a practitioner of the supernatural arts; a healer of the psychically troubled. These five stories deal with a ""traditionally"" haunted house, a French town full of shape shifters, an Egyptian fire elemental, devil worship, a nontraditional werewolf, and multidimensional space. All of these stories are just dripping with mood and sensuous atmosphere, and all become pretty chilling. Most horror books don't give me the slightest shiver (""The Haunting of Hill House"" being a notable exception), but I found this volume to be both eerie and beautifully written. I only wish that Algernon Blackwood had created more stories treating of John Silence, a truly fascinating character."
2,If only John Silence lived up to his name...,"The John Silence stories are not among Blackwood's more inspired creations. Even the best of them tend to conclude with a pompous ""explanation"" of the supernatural events, as Blackwood attempts to propagandise for his personal brand of mysticism. This is all very well, but if you don't happen to share Blackwood's beliefs it's no more than an irritation, and even if you do it might well bring you down to earth with a bump after some of his fine atmospheric writing in the better tales. It's a pity that S T Joshi, who made much the same observations in his excellent ""The Weird Tale"", couldn't have persuaded Dover to bring out, instead, Blackwood's truly astounding collection, ""Incredible Adventures"", from which Silence's tiresome explicitness is almost entirely absent."
2,john's revelations are dull,"i love blackwood at his best. this is not it. one great story, otherwise this detective doesn't work for me. if it only had been more crime-like, i might have liked it. these explanations, investigations, plots, are just not good enough. probably his worst work."
5,Just buy it...,"These are two of my favorite thrash albums from the '80s. I got to see them in Oakland calif. during the ""SURF""tour before it came out. The drummer is one of my favorites. And for you Faith No More fans(I am Not ONE) They do the best version I have ever heard of War Pigs. the drummer again.YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS OR YOU ARE NOT A TRUE THRASH METAL FAN..there ya go kiddies!!!!!"
4,Excellent for the dabbler in linguistics,"I'm interested in linguistics, and I took a few classes in it in college twenty years ago. This was a very interesting book for someone like me, since it presents new ideas in diachronic linguistics, without assuming more background than I had. It was great to be taken out to the edge of the field, where science is being done, without having to battle through a mass of technicalities. Plus, it's very well-written and fun to read."
1,More trash from Microsoft,"Save your money, another worthless book from Microsoft Press. You would think a company like Microsoft, with more than $50 billion in cash reserves, would spend a little money on decent documentation for their products. Their online documentation is marginal, and their textbooks are worse. Again save your money!"
4,Love and Duty,"Nicely written, this book is very easy to get in to. Both women are strong and involved in their jobs. Their love affair is touching and captivating."
5,An excellent book by someone who has a designer's approach.,"This book gives good basic information about fleece, its content, the manufacturers, the history of fleece and sewing tips. But what sets this book apart is the way in which Rochelle uses fleece - she uses it the way a designer would use fine wool - she does not limit it to the standard fleece jackets, blankets, and accessories. Using very nice photographs of real clients, Rochelle inspires the modern sewer to try something new with this marvellous fabric - sculpture it, add nylon accents to it artistically, trim it, use it in garments that are functional yet also extremely fashionable. A must-have book for the fleece sewer."
3,"Very basic, no design instructions","This book gives all the basics for sewing fleece, and while it shows some terrific clothes, there are no details to explain how to acheive these looks. The author suggests ""modifying"" a pattern for a dress or jacket, but never gives specifics on which patterns, what modifications were made, etc. Very frustrating if you have fallen in love with one of the photos and are interested in reproducing the look. You'll have better luck with the Polarfleece Adventures books by Nancy Cornwell."
5,Loggins On His Land...A 100 for this one!!!!!!!!,"Knowing that Loggins was born in Washington, you can imagine what is to perform on the forest!.I think it's a dream come true for Kenny, and just watch the way he sings ""Forever"". Eventhough there are various Leap Of Faith songs, the environment in the video is very, very good.Loggins let us see a part of his phylosophy during chats with the crowd.The quality of images and sound is very clear and almost live when you view it on a 53"" inches flat projector TV!!!!.I must recommend this DVD to all of those whose love the Loggins music.Very Very Good Kenny!!!!!!!"
4,Journey back to pooh corner,"I found this DVD well performed and produced. I deducted a star because I thought the commentary between a couple songs was a bit preachy, but the message was okay. It just seemed out of place and detracted from the concert. That said, this DVD is very enjoyable and the duet with Micheal McDonald was a nice touch."
5,Great example of a top notch DVD,"This DVD is shot amongst the redwoods. The music is a little is really well put together by Kenny and a diverse group of musicians.The video and sound quality are superb. If you don't like Kenny, try renting this to enjoy your home theatre system. If you like Kenny, it's a must buy.Great song with Micheal McDonald also!"
4,Great Show,I have had the cd of this concert for years and always wished I had been there. When I found this dvd I could finally see the whole show. There is a part where Kenny Loggins stops playing and lets the audience ask questions. This was really hoaky and the questins seemed staged. Other than that the music is so good.
5,Great DVD,"Expecting a slighly lesser video quality because it was taped in '93, we were thrilled with the video and audio !Not being one for rambling reviews, all I can say is BUY IT if you like Kenny Loggins at all !"
3,Great Show!--Not-so-good DVD-imaging!,"It's all here! All your favorite Kenny Loggins songs performed with an excellent backing band featuring superb harmonies, a gorgeous setting, and an appreciative audience. What's lacking? The DVD quality when viewed on my computer monitor using PowerDVD software with and without hardware decoding yields a mediocre, image quality, i.e., all outlines appear a bit fuzzy. The sound quality and performance of the songs are excellent and if you're into live performances and especially a fan of Kenny's, this is a good DVD to purchase! I just wish the video quality was better though ...Ken Laing"
1,The Adventures of Skippy cannot compete with Skippy the Bush Kangaroo,"THE ADVENTURES OF SKIPPY CANNOT HOLD A CANDLE TO THE ORIGINAL TV SERIES, SKIPPY THE BUSH KANGAROO. THE EPISODES ARE BETTER IN THE ORIGINAL. I BOUGHT THE ENTIRE SERIES, INCLUDING THE MOVIE, THE INTRUDERS. I ENJOYED THEM AS A KID, AND STILL ENJOY THEM NOW. I CAN USE THEM OT TEACH OTHERS ABOUT CARING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND ITS ANIMALS."
4,Good quality baby romper,"After looking in countless other stores (actual and online) for simple summer pajamas for my 6-month-old daughter - something easy on and easy off with diaper access, but not a onesie - I finally came across these. They have worked out well and are made of good quality, soft cotton. Although they are made of a heavier/thicker cotton, and they did shrink a little bit after washing, neither has been a problem. I liked them so much, I went ahead and bought some in larger sizes for next summer."
2,Didnt last long at all,I wanted this romper because all girls rompers have frills or elastic and I wanted something plain and cute. This product had that simple quality but after very few washes the fabric got kind of stiff and didnt feel really nice and soft anymore. It was a disappointment.
3,A little roomy,"I ordered two colors of the same romper and never received the lilac colored romper. The yellow one I did get was good quality, although was too big for my daughter who usually wears 12-18 or 18 mo clothing. The company was prompt and courteous when notified about the missing item and refunded my money within 24 hours. I would order from them again!"
1,Unhappy,"This product was of poor quality. The blade is so dull it would not even cut a tomato. Would love a refund, but did not save the address as to where to send it back."
1,too much hype,"boy, was this over=rated. it is no use to me. all it does is cut the item if you hold the item in your hand the guard is totally useless. I'm not going to get my finger sliced off for a few onion slices.and a metal glove---that made me laugh. I'll just get the old food processer out from now on and forget the ""non-sensical hyped up pieces of junk"" out in the marketplace today. cannot believe i fell for all the GREAT reviews about this item. would never buy it again. never."
5,Excellent intro to a slicer,"This is an excellent intro to a slicer -- a very good pre-mandoline purchase.This isn't adjustible in it's thickness, so you get what it cranks out, which is very nice, thin slices, about 1/8"". A great in a small apartment kitchen, it's very small and easy to store. It's also top-rack dishwasher safe.The only thing I wish it had is a small guard to clip over the ceramic blade, so that it's stored safely...they are not kidding when they say the ceramic blade is SHARP!!! be very careful (and don't do the 'oh, i'll just run my finger on it to see how sharp it really is' test, like i did! ouch!)."
5,WOW! Great slicer!,"This handy little slicer is such a gem. Slices really thin, quick clean up and easy to keep around. An all around winner.Kyocera Double Edged Mandolin Slicer, Red"
2,The bag is good but it DID NOT include any gloves as advertised.,"The packaging was torn and completely beaten up and there weren't any gloves included, despite the very name of the product and a giant sticker on the bag saying gloves were included."
2,"Too much fluff, not enough detail for an adult.","This book may be fine for children or adolescents, but there is not enough substance to keep an intellegent adult interested. I expected more. I will probably return the book."
4,As a high school freshman.,"I took this test in June of my freshman year, and with the help of this book and a lot of dedication, I got a 770 on my SAT 2 Biology test. The review book does an excellent job of laying all the necessary facts out and divides the information into appropriate sections. However, it does assume that you have already mastered a basic high school biology course, and it is only there for REVIEW and recalling facts.I would recommend the book to all the students who will actually put in the time and effort to study. Shelling out ten or twenty dollars for this review book won't accomplish anything."
1,Waist of money,"There is a reason this book is cheap. It is not the size (although it is tiny and thin). This is bok is basically a very basic checklist for preparing for MATCH. There is nothing about HOW to avoid the misytakes etc. It is just a marketing gimmic.If you have the extra 15 bucks and want to support the author - go ahead, but don't expect ti find anything more then what is already out there on aamc website on on the multiple forums online.Overall - sorry I bought it, but it was not too expensive."
1,Nothing good about this book,"No new information in this book, waste of your time and money, there are better books on this subject available. I returned it the next day to Amazon."
1,Not a good one !,I got surprised of the brief and insufficient topics of this book and regreted buying it.
2,Common sense,"The book highlighted areas which seemed to just be common sense. For example, common mistakes included lying, not asking the right person to write your LOR, procrastinating, being evasive, not writing thank you notes...the chapter lists go on, and I am sure you can fill in the blank under these chapter headings. You're better off just finding info off the internet and talking to everyone - current students, faculty, and residents. I thought FA for the Match had more in depth information and if you need to read a book, that would be the one."
2,A little disappointing,"I was hoping this would be an instructional video on Yin Yoga, when in fact it is a video of a led hatha flow class or part of a workshop. The video ends with a 10 minute (?) silent clip of Sarah Powers in seated meditation."
4,excellent stories for all mankind in anime form,"original was a manga book seriesin the 1970s..by our ownwalt disney of japan...now you get to see it..more or lessaccurate to the book form...in dvd movie form...GET itif you wish to know about life,spiritual values and deep facts of thousands of yearsand more...serious people, and even young OPEN minded clean kidswill carry these lessonsfor all their lives.see how it changes your life.english subtitles...are ok...they get to the point eventually.msg gets across."
3,CD,I was a little disappointed with this cd. I love Denean but felt this drifted away from the Native American sounds a bit. I didn`t feel as connected to nature listening to this cd either. I could just be comparing this to the other Denean music that I love!
5,Sharp Microwave,My husband & I were looking for a microwave for my daughter & her husband for a Christmas gift. This is the same brand that we have & are very happy w/ it. This is exactly what we were looking for & so happy to find it @ such a reasonable price. Their home is nearing completion & they are so excited to install this microwave & start using it. Our daughter said that she just loves the modern look & knows that it'll look wonderful w/ all their other stainless steal appliances.
2,Dies after 3 years,"Always had Sharp microwaves - the first one lasted about 10 years, this model lasted 3 and died today. The lights are on, the timer goes down but no turntable, no fan, just doesnt work.I know they wont last forever but 3 years is a bit too less."
5,Good Family size Microwave.,"This Sharp Microwave is Great for a Family. Its Large size is a big plus.Easy operation and nice finish and very powerful.We had an LG oven before and it is a JUNK ! It lasted only 2 years.Our ""old"" Microwave was a Sharp also and its still working after 20+ years!My rating A+++"
5,After much research online...,"After our old Microwave died we started searching the market online and in stores. I purchased Consumer Reports for microwaves and then searched for them on Amazon to read the customer reviews. The top ten rated had horrible customer reviews. So then decided to search from the bottom of the list up, and this is when I found our next microwave. Loud was the only beef with this microwave. Now in our house ""loud"" with all our kids is nothing compared to a microwave. Basically if your trying to sleep near by this microwave then maybe it would seem loud. But the 1200 watts cooks everything super fast, even heat with the turning tray is awesome! This is used several times a day and after a month no complaints!"
5,Sharp 2nd,"This is my second Sharp microwave. The last one lasted 14 years,a family of six kids and tons of cooking. Kids are out of the house now, but parties and gatherings have never stopped. Used my microwave not only for reheating but lots of cooking and baking. Absolutely loved it. When I got this new one had to learn and adjust to the increased wattage. The sensor cooking is taking a little adjustment, but so far it has been wonderful. My husband is really enthusiastic about sensor cooking, and he very rarely cooks anything. I wanted a large cavity [holds 9x13 pan]again, and was surprised at how evenly it cooks! Must say,so far I am pleased with the microwave and hope it lasts like its predecessor. Right now it definitely rates five stars!!!! A Pleased Pam!!"
4,good but large microwave,This microwave works pretty good. The sensor cook is awesome and will reheat or cook items almost perfectly. The only bad thing I've seen is that it's got a rather large footprint.
1,Darn Door,I never got to use this microwave oven because the door would not stay shut. I had to send it back. Darn. Amazon was very helpful and took care of my problem. I am pleased with Amazon's service.
1,A first class failure,"i chose this oven after reading the 4 and 5 star reviews. Take heed . read the ones and twos. After reading the manual AND following on screen directions The only two keys I found to be working was the night life and clear keys. As well, the light in the cavity went on when the oven was plugged in and never went out. All of this after sitting in my wheelchair waiting for my gardener to come and open the box and get the oven placed in the kitchen. Incidentally, there was no shipping mishandling in evidence. Thanks to Amazon's policies I lost nothing financially which is not the usual case with local purchases."
3,Does this run on diesel?,"Just purchased this microwave and it is so loud that it seems like there is a semi tractor trailer idling in my kitchen. We could neither hear the television nor have a normal-volumed conversation with it on. Everything else on the unit seemed great, but won't get to explore them as we will be returning it."
4,Good (and Loud),"This is my 4th Sharp microwave and I'm really happy with this oven. Like others have said, it is loud, but with 1200 watts that really should be expected. It's fast, plenty big, looks great, and easy to clean. One concern is in the door button. This is a stainless steel microwave but the button that opens the door is made of very cheap plastic. It's not been a problem for our family of 2, but a family with more people opening and closing the microwave might want to pay particular attention to how flimsy it is. All in all, though, I certainly recommend this product."
3,Makes awesome baked potatoes,"Why just 3 stars?The start and stop buttons are inconveniently placed in the center of all the various sensor cook function buttons. I hurriedly tried to stop the oven once, and pushed the night light button instead, and was momentarily blinded.As already mentioned, the night light is so bright and glaring, that it does nothing to help see the sensor function buttons better. The interior light is rather dim too, so opening the door didn't provide much illumination. Heck, these function buttons are hard for me to read even with my glasses on.The sensor defrost cooked the outer edges of my block of frozen ground beef after only 1.5 minutes. I decided to defrost manually, with the power level set on 20%.The sensor cook setting for frozen entrees overcooked my TV dinner.So, what's there to like? The three baked potatoes I made came out perfect, and all I did was push the baked potato sensor cook button."
2,Does not perform like it should for this price.,"This microwave does not heat as quickly or as hot as we would like. It has some great features, but its performance is just not up to par for the price."
1,Died after ~ 2 & 1/2 years of use.,"Very loud compared to similar microwave ovens.Started tripping circuit breaker after only 2 & 1/2 years of use.Now trips circuit breaker 100% of the time, upon starting.My guess the magnetron is defective.I would not buy another one!"
1,Did not like it.,The display is hard to see unless you are at eye level with it.I was not impressed with the quality.
1,Not worth it,"The pens don't work well, the drawer that holds the pens just falls out, erasing the ""ink"" is a pain, and the thing is really cheaply made. Not much fun at all."
4,What you see is what you get.,"Both my children ( 7 & 9 yrs.) liked this toy. It really is very eye- catching, and fun. The educational part is what you make it. I am a teacher and will probably use this in my classroom to catch students' attention. Seems very durable, love the storage drawer for the markers! Overall worth the money."
4,New to Sci Fi? This is a great introduction to the genre!,"For being such a quick read, it is commendable that the author was able to touch on so many different aspects of Sci-Fi. Without really fleshing out any one aspect, you will find many different types /styles of Sci-Fi being introduced: Military flashbacks, Augmentation, Cloning, Alien Mind Control, Genetic modification, CyberPunk, Space Cowboy, Manifest Destiny. All of this is delivered using a soft approach which doesn't take the reader out of this solar system and doesn't jam any hard sci-fi or new vocabulary onto the reader. In this aspect it is much more approachable to readers who are new to Sci-Fi. Moreover, the plot and sub plots will keep even the most seasoned Sci-Fi readers well entertained and suitably misdirected until the last page. (cover art was a missed opportunity)"
5,Read this book twice.,"Voice of the Whirlwind is a complex piece of work, and I'm not ashamed to say I didn't ""get it"" the first time through. For me it was the kind of novel that opens up like a lotus blossom on a second read, revealing the beauty within.The contention over whether it's a sequel to Hardwired comes from it taking place in the same universe, but more than a century later. There's little to tie them together; the proper ""sequel"" to Hardwired is a short short called Solip:System, available in the Williams collection Frankensteins and Foreign Devils."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This novel, set in the same milieu as Hardwired, must find out why theclone of a military man has been brought back, and what happened to the original man himself.The book is set two hundred years after the events in the previousbook, and the clone is itself is missing the events of over ten years.After getting out of the hospital and activation, he finds hisinstincts for danger, and his own dangerousness have not gone anywhere."
3,ok,"This was ok, wasnt really what I was looking for but had some really beautiful vows that could be used or changed"
3,I returned it.,"There were a lot of classic vows and some more original, but this book was not very helpful for the wedding I was helping plan.Judith Johnson's ""The Wedding Ceremony Planner: The Essential Guide to the Most Important Part of Your Wedding Day"" was perfect for our needs, however. Everyone was raving about the beautiful cerermony =)"
3,Not what I expected but I made it work,"All the components that were included worked fine. Don't be fooled by the bumper brackets ""where required"" verbage. I expected some kind of bumper extension brackets because last time I checked when you raise the body from the frame you need extensions to make the bumpers line up correctly. That is the only disappointment I had. Now I am going to fabricate some bumper brackets to get my bumpers to line up with the body."
4,Read It and Weep,An excellent book in many respects. I witheld the fifth star only because there is so much straight history that some readers might get restive. A good read and a interesting and informative look inside the IRA and a sad retelling of the British atrocities that are rarely made public. Looking forward to her next book which will complete her retelling of Eire's struggles for independence and reunification.
5,Perfect Finish,"The product arrived shrink-wrapped with no flaws in the finish. The louvers worked easily, and it looks to be quite sturdy construction."
5,Touching...,"Reading this book was a wonderful experience. What a touching story of a family that develops as all families do; realizing we love our family members even more when we accept them loving us the only way they know how. All this against the backdrop of a still unspoiled area of America. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this region, history or living.Allen"
5,Feels Like Far,This book gives a nice overview of living on the plains of western South Dakota. The author shares insights into her life growing up on a ranch and then later moving to Wyoming. Most interesting is the evolving relationship with her father as he ages and becomes not only more dependent on his daughter but is also becoming more cantankerous. The stresses in her life are real and something we can all identify with at some point in all lives. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and intend to read more of her books.
4,Good history lesson,"I watched this movie with my daughter (10) after our chapter in her history book about the pilgrims. We homeschool and always love extra reinforcement of lessons with videos, worksheets, games, etc. This one was pretty good. A tad boring with the monotone narrator but it had some good information in it. I really enjoyed the segment about Plymouth, England and how the Pilgrims spent their last few weeks in the only country they had known. Overall, we enjoyed it. Loved that it was available free with my Prime membership."
2,This is why history was always boring,"Although this documentary had good information, it was dry and monotone. I had hoped it would be a good reinforcement for our homeschool, but even I was not excited to watch it. This is history taught as I remember as a child - dull and monotone; not as I have come to love history as an adult."
5,"THE POWER BROKERS, A DEFINATE AWARD WINNER!","Congradulations to the writer, a great read. The power Brokers is a lesson in life. It makes you laugh and it makes you cry. Definately not a beach book, but one that makes you think."
2,Suggest You Only Buy To Play The WOW Card Game Not For Loot Cards,"I Suggest You Only Buy To Play The WOW Card Game Not For Loot Cards. I Bought the whole box, along with other boxes in different series, and the actual loot cards for the online game were terrible. You are better off buying a loot card you want off Ebay and not wasting your money on these unless you want to play the actual card game."
3,trading cards,"My 16 year old son loved his box of WOW cards I purchased off Amazon, it saved me from running around tyring to find enough packages to make up a box. He loved them! Thanks Amazon!"
3,WoW TCG Fires of Outland,TCG booster 24-pack with one pack holding a special rub off card with a code for use in the Wow online game prize. Still do not know how to utilize the code card properly. Currently have 2 of them.
2,Not Bird Friendly!,"I thought I was getting a follow-up to the wildly popular ""Learning to Crawl, Stories of Recovery"" which changed my life, but was horrified to find the advocate use of actual bird feathers, with an included sample, to ""lift yourself up towards the light."" As a member of F.A.R.C.E. (Feathers Are Really Crappy Embellishments), I am outraged! Yes, there are some useful points, but other less cruel means could have been used to make these lessons as momentous as the first book. I will be haunted by visions of naked ducks..."
5,Text for aerodynamically inclined,"Students in my AR010 (Remedial Aerodynamics) course have hugely enjoyed Lavadour's easy-to-follow, step-by-step directions and helpful blueprints, reserving highest praise for the ""Hindenburg Hints,"" ""Flying Wing"" and ""Red Planet Rover"" chapters. Also appreciated: the ""Equipment You Will Need"" lists and author's photographs of materials and supplies prefacing each chapter, the colorful, hand-drawn ""No Fly Zone"" maps, and the accordion fold sheet music section, ""Airborn 100 Years: ""The Wrights are Right With Me!"" to ""Fly Me to the Moon"")."
3,Tom Petty Rip Off?,"I thought this was going to be a Tom Petty autobiography (Ex: Well I started out down a dirty road/Started out all alone/And the sun went down as I crossed the hill/The town lit up the world got still/Im learning to fly but I aint got wings/Comin down is the hardest thing) although I was initially disappointed, I ended up being pleasantly surprised with this little gem of a book. With step by step instructions for ordinary humans, written from the Raven's perspective and voice, I was flying around my yard in 1 to 2 days flat. Next month I hope to be flying back and forth to work to cut on gas costs and CO2 pollution."
2,Product Problem,"The product was received within the expected timeframe. However, I am unable to install the encryption software. No instructions, no support contact number."
3,Would like to see an updated version,"Sorry, meant to mark four stars.I like that it has so much information all in one place, however much of the information in this book can be found on the internet (although with A LOT more work). This book gave me a much appreciated focus to my cancer research.There are breakthoughs that the book does not cover (for example fungal infection) and it was written when the understanding of prions (the cause of mad cow disease for example)and their role in health risk was only beginning.Would like to see a more updated version, almost 10 years old, a more recent version could only be better."
3,Big Guns!,"I wouldn't want anything in this book pointed at my player character.Can we please do something a little more subtle than throwing Insect Spirit Queens, Force 20 Free Spirits, and Juggernauts at the PCs in direct combat? I know if I went up against a Juggernaut, I'd at least want a tank, and tanks are way beyond Shadowrun's game mechanic limits; the lesser (but not by much) weapons found in this book, although pretty cool, do not belong in either PC or Corporate hands. If a Corporation finds itself deploying this sort of stuff its bottom line would sink overnight."
4,"More toys, more guns, more rules. Do we really need them?","Well, here's yet another sourcebook full of new and improved equipment for the players. Most of it is just too powerful to simply have your players carry around. Who on Earth would want to see characters walking around in Heavy Military Battle Armor, armed with portable lasers? All of the above is now quite affordable. Still, it does contain some quite logical rules clarifications. Question is, do we really need to make the game more complicated? It is, however, nice to see a sourcebook dedicated to the mercenary archetype, although the street sam will probably make equal use of it. The equipment in this book is well-suited to the cyberware in ""Cybertechnology"", and should only be used in a multi-threat campaign world."
2,Did we really need this?,"Unless your GM runs a very different type of campaign, then this book is mostly just a bunch of new toys for the Samurai. Not very useful, and most of the items/ rules listed imply a scale of combat larger than what I'd like to get my character into. Some of the rules expansions in the back can be useful, though- if you love having a million rules to govern every single thing you can do."
2,What you have feared has arrived and is available to PCs,When one of my players bought this book I thought that it would be a good thing but when I started to read it I was horrified at the way fasa took this book I thought that I was reading a Rifts book and that made me want to head for the hills and find shelter from the end of the world. I think that it was just a book for munchkins and I don't like the idea that shadowrun is moving to the more power less roleplaying end of the spectrum.
1,radiator cap,thought I was getting what the pic showed which is same as original instead they send me a universal witch I could have got at any old auto parts store cheaper. would return it but would cost more than its worth.
3,Radiator cap,Did not receive cap that is pictured. The one received was a standard metal cap that is available anywhere. Cap works but if you are looking for an OEM replacement this isn't it...
2,A Bit Lacking,"An adult can read this book in 5 - 10 minutes, so keep that in mind when deciding if you should purchase it or look for the title in your local library. The book is, basically, about a `seed' that is planted and grows into a lovely blossoming vine along the trellis one spring. It's kind of like the story of the ugly duckling who turned into a swan.. the seed doesn't believe in its own worth, but its planter (known as The Nice Lady), believes in the seed. I wasn't impressed with the story; I suppose it's about nature and the Earth and the cycle of water, sun, etc., along with patience. But, I don't think a small child is going to really recognize all the nuances, and an adult is too old to care."
5,Inspiring for all ages,This is a sweet tale well told. All ages will enjoy this inspirational story that uplifts and encourages. I really enjoyed it.
1,one of her worst books,"I found nothing to the story that might hold an interest for a pre-school child for about two minutes but not enough to finish the book, didn't feel it was for adults and read nothing of encouragement."
4,The Trellis and the Seed,"I really enjoy this author and can find wisdom in all her books, especially this one. pat"
5,A Tickle or A Kiss?,"A book of encouragement for all ages, enchantingly illustrated. God's perfect timing, mixed with grace and peace and the warmth of the earth and the water of the skies, can make us all be better than we ever imagined. A small volume, which I read in its entirety on my lunch hour, still delivers a powerful message.The Nice Lady, Mamalinda"
5,Very nice,"This CD is a must have if you're a fan of Ottoman Turkish music. Read the short stories that explain each song while listening and you'll appreciate the music even more. In my opinion, it's like being in the Sultan's palace itself. This is a wonderful addition to your Ottoman Turkish music collection."
3,good comeback attempt,"This was Lisa Lisa & cult jam's comeback attempt. On the one hand Full Force still produced it, on the other C'N'C Music factory did the rest. Somehow the two production teams don't seem to fit together. You have ""old"" LIsa Lisa style plus a ""new"" style that basically sounds like everything CNC did. A very good ballad is ""Forever"". Apart from that sometimes the album really lacks individualism."
2,ALMOST LIKE A ROOT CANAL,"APPOINTMENT FOR A KILLING is another one of those early 90s tv movies that gave tv stars a chance to ""stretch"" their wings and try something different from their current series. Too bad they didn't put a little more life into their portrayals. Based on ""true"" incident, the movie follows the psychotic crimes of dentist Corbin Bernsen who has been offing people for about twenty years. He is currently married to Markie Post (who appears to be on Sominex), and has a sleazy mistress (Suzanne Barnes, over the top indeed) and an ex-con sidekick (Don Swayze in a wasted character). He confesses his latest crime to Markie and she goes to the FBI (a stoic Kelsey Grammer) who uses her to get a confession out of Bernsen. Corbin's real life mom (YOUNG AND RESTLESS's indefatigable Jeanne Cooper) also appears. There's little suspense and a very wimpy climax."
5,Known from experience,This book simply brings to light the things that are already known by Clemson Alumni around the globe.
5,Worth its weight in GOLD!,Have you ever wished you could remember all those great tips your grandmother told you or the one's you've heard somewhere along the line but have no way of remembering? Even more have you wished there was a cheap and effective way to do something? Well here they are--quick tips for how to do stuff. This is the greatest resource I've come across in years. And they're so easy to find. What a bargain!
5,Growl,Great artist! I woud recomend this to all music lovers. Ray Wylie Hubard where have you been all my life?
4,Old school cool.,"I first heard Above The Law on the ""Pump Up The Volume"" movie soundtrack, and the track ""Freedom Of Speech"" was one of the stand-outs on that disc. This is just one of the great forgotten albums of the early 90's, much like Da Lench Mob's ""Guerillas In Tha Mist"". If you're a fan of N.W.A., checking this out is a must, as Dr. Dre produces and drops a few rhymes of course. The delivery and flow from these guys is excellent. Overall ""Livin' Like Hustlers"" is dope, right down to the ""Last Song""."
5,biggest rap sleeper ever,"From the PE sampled noise rush Murder Rap, to the relaxed smoked out Last Song, through Another Execution, Freedom of Speech, Flowin, and the rest, this album is musically, and lyrically Above most anything from its time. I think it sounds as good as NWA, it just wasn't quite as groundbreaking, I suppose, nor quite as raw in sheer cussing and stuff. I dont think ATL ever really came off this good afterwards, but 187 and his high powered amped up high voice, tempered by the cool kmg make this album a classic, I think. But at least out here, its never been that popular. perhaps out west it is."
5,Mechanics of Materials,I bought this book as a supplement to my old school text because an engineer can never have enough good resouces in the working world. I chose it after much research as it was well recommended as THE BOOK to have. I have found it to be an excellent reference book. Most all the homework problems have answers in the back as a check. The publishing and editing qualities are excellent.
2,Flawed Statistics,"I found ""Practical Speculation"" lacking. The first two chapters were interesting, but the analysis of data in subsequent chapters were flawed, in my opinion.Niederhoffer cites scatter plots as demonstrating correlation/predictibility of various aspects of the market. I looked at many graphs and didn't see much that showed statistical correlation. The correlation coefficients (R-squared values) were all very low.The trading ideas were interesting, but the analysis behind them was misleading. You need strategies with better correlations to hurdle transaction costs, and then, maybe, you can make some money."
1,Ruminations of the Log Rollers,"It appears that the coffee klatch has gotten together to wax on about their favorite trading buddies: you review mine, I review yours. Is it possible to get a fair review of the book if these online back-scratchers didn't sow their 5-star seeds in each other's fields? As far as the book goes, it's full of cute stories but as a practical speculation tool, it's downright comical. The authors cite the VIX as their favorite indicator and present a brief study of the market's performance after the VIX hits a certain absolute level. Hello Grandma, the apple pie's already been baked! The VIX ain't that easy any more, but the authors pony up their hypothesis as if it were an earth-shattering insight. As my surf buddy would say, this is trading for dilettantes, DUDE! I think a better title for the book would have been Impractical Speculation so we could have learned exactly how one reconciles practical insights with impractical trading."
1,Waste of time and money.,"Regardless of the name ""Practical Speculation"", after reading this book I found nothing in it useful for the practical trading. One half of the book's content looks more like a collection of the emails and letters from the author's buddies, who, by the way, did not succeed in the trading business. The other half of the book consists of some details of the author's biography, what is also of no help for the readers who bought the book in hope to gain some new knowledge about markets.After reading this book, I think that it was written just in an attempt to recover at least some tiny portion of the money which the author lost during ""practical speculation"" with his own trading capital. Even one star is too much for this book."
5,Intellectual Investment Entertainment,"Read this if you perused the scathing reviews at the beginning!I've read a number of investment books. Most offer logical, statistical, ideological support for the author's paradigm - all with the presumption of profit to the reader. Most lack the personality and love-of-life that suffuses Vic and Laurel's book. Practical Speculation offers no false hopes of easy formulae for wealth, nor how-to recipes thereof.The ""Spec Duo"" reaches into rare academic and athletic experience with humility and apropos self-deprication, and exposes the human basis of an extraordinary speculator.If you have learned enough to know that there are no simple solutions to the paradox of the market, you will find this book insightful, humorous, and engaging. Highly recommended!"
2,Very long on words; very short on actionable advice,"This book gives meaning to the word ""filler."" This 390 page book could have been boiled down to about 40-50 pages, perhaps less. But instead the authors filled it with gimmicky, extraneous filler to get to their point, which is ultimately not very prescriptively helpful. The authors arguably -- and I am not even sure of that -- succeed in getting investors to doubt certain pieces of conventional wisdom. But all they do is debunk. The whole second half of the book was meant to be constructive, to give investors real information that you can use. But when you get down to it, there is scarce little there. At bottom, this was a really annoying read and regrettably a waste of money."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I bought this book based on the title, description of it's content, and a few abriged excerpts. And after reading half of it, I realized that I was learning nothing, and was wasting time that I could use reading something useful about investing. This book is not about investing, nor trading. And it's definitely not about the practical speculation of financial markets. It seems much more like a Wall Street Journal, Barron's, or CNBC feature that got out of hand, or a graduate students thesis paper.Take your trading and investment lessons from those who make a lot of money from professional trading and investing, not from professional writers who make a living writing."
5,"James Gregory, It Could Be a Law","This company was excellent in filling my order promptly.The product (cd) is in very good condition and I will use items from this source again.I did have a hard time in placing the order through Amazon, which ledme through many steps, due to my adddress, which is the same that I have always used, very annoying to have to take so much time."
4,Nice little phone,"I just got this phone and it is working fine. The person who says it is not compatible with Cingular is only partly correct. Cingular is currently making limited use of the 850 Mhz spectrum. Most of NA is 1900 Mhz, so this phone works fine.If I have to replace it in a few years, I would have anyway. And yes, I use Cingular."
5,Bananas Pajamas Wish Fairies,"My 6 yr. old twin grandsons really like the Bananas Pajamas videos. ""Wish Fairies"" is cute and keeps them entertained. They watch this video over and over. It is nice to have a wholesome video for them to watch."
3,Tuscany,"Views were too short. I've been to Tuscany, & my own video was better.I think more time should have been spent on locations."
3,Average quality,"Not deluxe, but nice to have for simple uses. Flip out tools don't lock and it doesn't cut strings like a beast but it's fine for the job."
2,Don't buy this when you can get it for FREE............,"It is ok, but a real good deal when they give it to you for free by attending one of his many ""free seminars"". These ""free seminars"" are just a two hour sales presentation for one of his trainers to get you to pay for coaching, etc. The CD is ok, but not worth much. It is just another way for him to promote his stuff."
1,NO WARRANTY @ Amazon.com,"My Radar detector (V940) was purchased January 2010. One month later the detector stopped working and would not turn on. I verified it was not the power source or the cable; the unit was receiving power but would not turn on. Well I wasn't too happy but I knew it was covered by a 1 Year warranty. I called up Beltronics only to find out that they DO NOT HONOR WARRANTY CLAIMS for products purchased from Amazon.com!!! Even worse, they wanted $79.99 + shipping to fix the unit. Needless-to-say, I find their level of customer service inadequate and disconcerting given the volume of product they sell through this site. I will not purchase another Beltronics product and would advise highly against it given their lack of professionalism in standing behind the quality of their own product."
5,A sweeping survey of the foundations which have made Mexico what it is today,"For a weighty but surprisingly easily-accessed history of Mexico, don't miss THE LIFE AND TIMES OF MEXICO: a narrative of 3,000 years of Mexican history and culture which ranges from social and political insights to overviews of Mexico's ethnic and indigenous cultures. For over sixty years essayist and critic Earl Shorris had a physical and spiritual connection to Mexico, producing numerous acclaimed writings as a result of this inspiration and connection. His LIFE AND TIMES OF MEXICO represents something different, though: a sweeping survey of the foundations which have made Mexico what it is today. A 'must' for any who would understand the culture and sentiments which make up modern Mexico."
5,Beautiful and Disturbing,"I'm glad to see that Dalkey Archive has reprinted this most beautiful and disturbing book. I've owned the original Knopf version since it came out in 1996. These stories made me squirm one minute and pant in jealousy the next. The precision and the lean muscularity of each piece is almost disorienting. Along with Diane Williams and Gary Lutz, Ms. Schutt is writing some of the best prose around. By the way, check out the periodical ""NOON"" if you want to see what Ms. Williams and Ms. Schutt do in their free time."
3,NightWORK,"This book, to me, was a roller coaster of short stories. I started out enjoying the book immensely. But as I read on, the stories began to go downhill for me. Then once again back up and back down.I think this book was very well written, I do. But in some cases, the stories were overstuffed with pretty words and became hard to follow at points.It wasn't a horrible book, by any means. I loved parts and hated parts. I wouldn't recommend it to someone, unless they were ready to dive into a deep book of artsy stories and scattered thoughts."
1,Sound & Fury,"Like Lutz, Holloand etc, this work is marked by Gordon Lish's language oriented narrative. Like many of Lish's writers--they are not Raymond Carver--the work is all style and no substance. Don't bother. It's sound and fury signifying nothing."
3,Not Made by Yamaha,"Do not be fooled by Amazon's title ""Yamaha PKBX2 Double X Portable Keyboard Stand"", this product or the box that it came with did not have any signs of it being associated with Yamaha Brand Name. It took me about 45 minutes to put this together, it could have been 15 minutes if the pieces are labeled. Other than the deceptive advertising and difficulty in assembling this stand, functionally the product appears to be sturdy and it can hold my Yamaha keyboard very well, and the height can be adjusted.Amazon shipped this in an outer box that can hold at least 10 of these stands. Talk about wastage in shipping cost, plastic air bags and cardboard. I hope Amazon addresses this soon, when Wal-mart can optimize packaging, definitely Amazon can do it."
3,It's O.K. ....,"Yes, the double X stand is better than the single, but it is impossible to secure our Yamaha keyboard to it. Not a very good model if you have younger children"
2,pieces missing,there were to of the legs missing. I contacted the seller and hope to hear from them soonYamaha PKBX2 Double X Portable Keyboard Stand
1,Missing part,I purchased this stand along with an electronic keyboard for my grandson's (who lives in another state) birthday. Many months later I learned that he was unable to use the stand because of a missing assembly part. These things happen but I'm disappointed.jh
1,Buyer beware,Expected it to fit the Yamaha YPT-400 keyboard (and it is billed as such) but it doesn't even come close. The piano simply sits on top of the stand waiting to be knocked over and crash to the floor. What a disappointment and what a waste of time ordering it. How frustrating to have to pack it all back up and return it. This item should not be paired with this piano. Buyer beware!
1,HORRIBLE ASSEBLY INSTRUCTIONS,These are the worst assembly instructions ever! They don't thell you which end is top of bpttom - and have minimal visual guides! It tool me 5hours and 4 people to get this thing put together - and two were enginers!
3,Where Do You See Yamaha?,"If this is a Yamaha product, why isn't anything on or in this box labled Yamaha? As far as I can tell, it's just another bootlrg item on the internet. It may fit a Yamaha but that doesn't make it a Yamaha. I will be sending a note to the Yamaha corporation to look into this item being sold under their trademark to see what they have to say about this."
1,Junk labeled as Yamaha,"I never write reviews but this product is awful! It is a very poorly constructed and cheap stand. It does have the Yamaha name in very small writing on the side of the box, along with ""made in China"".Seems to be a very cheap and generic stand that Yamaha has them put their name on the box in tiny writing. I can see why their name is so small on the box, I wouldn't want my name on this junk either."
2,Took a chance,"Read some of the reviews both good and bad. Thought I would take a chance and buy it, I just got it today.Well...the box arrived in such bad shape I thought it had been drug down the highway (maybe post office maybe not), there were no instructions and one of the bolts are missing.Can't tell you if it fits my keyborard yet YPG235 because it is laying on the floor until I can go buy the bolt, washers and nut.NO allen wrench either."
1,horrible stand,The stand was very wobbely after assembled. OK on carpet but horrible on hard wood. It was returned and accepted for return.
2,Don't expect too much.,"Well, at least it's relatively cheap. You can see how simple it looks, but it was kind of a pain to put together. The screws didn't line up well and the documentation was skimpy. Once completed, it still has a bit of a wobble. Yes, it will hold up the kid's keyboard, but the quality is pretty mediocre."
5,Heavy-duty and great value,"This is a nice, strong stand at a reasonable price... Able to support a Yamaha YPG-625 with ease."
1,I don't recommend this stand.,"This is a very cheaply made item. The directions are horrible and it took forever to figure out how to put it together. One of the parts was welded on crooked so I couldn't even get one of the screws in. I returned it and I do not recommend this item, it's worth it to spend a bit more money and buy a decent stand."
5,amaha Double X Stand is totally not compatible with this YPT310AD Keyboard!,Warning: Yamaha Double X Stand is totally not compatible with this YPT310AD Keyboard!I'm returning the Double X Stand.
1,Barely worth the money,"This is a cheap stand, sure...but it's not a value. First of all, it's a horrible pain in the rear to assemble. The directions included with the unit are sub-standard, giving a simple diagram that's of very little help. Personally, I got so frustrated assembling it that I nearly put it through a window. Take my advice--spend a few more dollars to get a decent stand from a local music store (most likely fully assembled) and leave this one alone."
3,"Good product, but...","This stand was extremely hard to assemble. The directions included were a simple picture that made no sense. But after much sweat and tears, the stand is perfect for our needs."
3,This product needs assembly directions,"Once assembled, the stand looks reasonably sturdy and will do the job. However, assembly is another story. I found all of the parts easily but there are minimal assembly directions in the box. I had to use the picture on the box to figure out whether a bolt went towards the inside or outside. I didn't find out until I had spent several hours putting it together that I'd assembled it upside down. Now you say, how can that be...because it is X-shaped. Believe me, it does make a difference because of the way you adjust the height."
4,Keyboard Stand,"Bought as gift. Assembly instructions weren't clear. Had to disassemble and re-do, but fortunately not difficult. You have to be careful of your knees when you sit down because of the crossbars being in the way. Seems sturdy and I like the way it looks."
3,Keyboard stand,"The stand wasn't that hard to put together, but I couldn't find the screws. They were in the legs of the stand. I read a review that said that and that is how I found the screws. The stand doesn't have anything that attachs to the keyboard, but it does its job and hopefully no one knocks the keyboard over."
1,NOT YAMAHA BRAND--READ,"This product arrived defective. The bars holes/cups were the bars rest were shaved down on the wrong end, which makes it impossible to assemble. I look to save a few bucks here and their, which is why I choose this one, I mean really how much does it cost to make these? Well now I will spend the extra bucks to go to a local music shop and buy one their for the reason of being able to return is a problem like this arises again. I guess this companies quality control must be non existent. Made in China, enough said."
2,not compatible with Yamaha keyboard,The title says it all. We went with the Double X because it looked more stable than the single. I know it's sounds funny but the Yamaha keyboard does not fit on the stand like it should. There are grooves under the keyboard that the stand should lock into. We have tried all sides of the stand but nothing works. The single would be more stable than the double if it fit right.
3,NOT RECOMMENDED FOR DRUMS,"When I bought the electronic drum, I was recommend this stand but it is not stable for drums. It works well with a keyboard but not a drum set and I don't think this should have been recommended. The stand is too high for the drummer to sit and play the drums. Not the right stand for electronic drums."
1,displease on christmas,this stand is NOT designed for the Yamaha EZ-250i even though it is listed in the accessories for this model.
3,HORRIBLE INSTRUCTIONS!!,"Sturdy stand. Remarkably unhelpful instructions. If you want to be able to adjust it, it takes a LOT of work to put it together properly (think 2 people and a lot of patience for an hour). There's about 6"" between adjustment pegs so it's not a precise fit."
1,More problems: Part made wrong,"This came with all needed parts, but one of the legs was fabricated wrong. The locking pin and bolt hole are put in at a 90 angle to the cutouts for the keyboard arm and floor foot - so you can either bolt the legs together OR mount the arm/foot, BUT NOT BOTH.It's useless until I get it to a machine shop and spend x dollars more. I'd return it, but there seems to be a high likelihood of getting another incomplete or wrongly made kit."
2,Horrible instructions,"This is an acceptable stand for the yamaha keyboard I bought, but as usual, Made In China. As such, the instructions were illegible. The picture on the box was no help. My engineer husband was thoroughly disgusted as he put this together on Christmas Eve.Buyers should know that the keyboard merely sits on top of the rubber feet and does not fit into it at all. A good bump would topple the keyboard."
3,The Stand,"I gave this stand 3 stars because of two things:1. It came with horrible directions - a one-half-page diagram that gave you hardly any help - it was just a picture of the stand put together.2. I bought the stand with a keyboard, so they came with free supersaver shipping - and when it arrived, the box was half open!So..."
5,Sturdy and nice looking,"At first I thought it was going to be complicated to put it together but it was not. When I had it completed it felt sturdy and looked really nice, is also very practical to change the height for the keyboard."
4,Yamaha keyboard stand,This keyboard stand is built very sturdy and was very affordable. I wanted a stand that I felt comfortable my keyboard would be safe on and I am very happy with my selection.
1,Good luck assembling this,"We received this bench for my son's keyboard. We tried several ways of assembling it, to no avail. The predrilled holes did not match up with the screws, unless they were forced, thereby weakening the stand. We sent the first one back and were sent a replacement, but that one had the same problem. Finally gave up, returned the second stand and ordered another stand from Musicians Friend."
1,Very Poor Product,"Many misssing parts, poorly designed and constructed, look for something else. Doesn't seem to be designed for a keyboard of any real size."
2,keyboard stand,I am not too thrilled with this purchase. The keyboard does not fit on it correctly. We can't make the stand open to the slots on the bottom of the keyboard for the stand.
2,Difficult assembly,You'd think it would be easy to install eight bolts with a key wrench. It would be if the machining were better or if the bolts were slightly longer. I had to go to Home Depot to buy slightly longer bolts for the badly machined holes. Crappy Chinese manufacturing standards.
4,Would be 5 Stars but Instructions are poor,"It works great now that it's assembled. The instructions were NOT helpful at all....they should explicitly explain why one upper and one lower bar have screw holes that are closer together. It's not rocket science, but it was a gift for my girlfriend and she hadn't seen the picture like I did to see why the screw holes are like that. This is a note to the seller."
3,Yamaha Keyboard Stand,"The stand shipped does not line up with the indentations on the Yamaha keyboard, making it unstable."
2,There are better alternatives,"The double X in this stand and wide legs make this a fairly stable base for anything.The only real problem is that there is no way of securing anything to it, things such as keyboards simply lay flat across it (the bars don't even match with the grooves in the bottom of Yamaha keyboards).If you're looking for a generic base that fits multiple brands of keyboards this is a good choice.However, for those with Yamaha keyboards looking for a secure base, I would recommend that Yamaha LC3 keyboard stand which screws into the bottom of most Yamaha keyboards."
3,Klax or Marble Madness?,"I bought this game recently thinking I would get two great games in one cartridge. I found out later you get only three of the six levels in marble madness and if that wasn't messed up enough I also noticed some changes in this half ***** version of the game:Level 2 Black steele marble is replaced by a marble muncherLevel 3 There are no waves leaving only a flat green groundAt least klax is the complete game so if you still want this cartridge buy it for klax only NOT marble madness. If you still want the feel of marble madness buy the game boy color game instead. For some people it may not be perfect but, I've been playing this game and, it is marble madness with all six levels and every obstacle and enemy exactly as I remembered it in the NES version except a little harder. In conclusion, I think that any future classic game compilations should not be left up to DSI games because they will only cut corners and make it a complete disaster to gamers all around the world."
1,Does iT Work?,I ordered the product and tried it. Either I did NOT have parasites or the product doesn't work. I saw absolutely no effect and was unaware that I was even taking it. No side effects at all.
5,Great drum key,"Works great, Product speaks for itself.The pearl logo is night to have, hole in the center is good for a piece of string.I have it hanging on the side of my stick bag right now."
4,bulky but sturdy,"as title says, it is well built. strong piece of metal that you can use for all your drum career. it would probably never crack or break and it takes some major time to wear out it's square whole. on the flip side you get a bulky drum key. at the price where i got this, it is pretty good."
5,Good diet recipes,"I found this book to be very helpful for my husbands diet. He is watching calories, fat and carbs. The breakdown for each recipe was very helpful and the recipes are very appetizing. I would recommend this book even if you are not watching your weight."
5,The Best One Ever,To be in your own home and watching this video is like being there with the family. Outstanding music and to see all the wonderful scenery is amazing. This is my favorite DVD.
5,Jerusalem,"I love the music of this DVD. That's why I ordered it. Unfortunately, I got a cd. I'm very disappointed."
1,Wrong DVD,"I clearly ordered the Jerusalem DVD. The invoice even confirmed that. They sent me the London DVD. Am not happy, will not return as this is a gift that I need to give soon, but won't order from Noram again. I mean they cannot even get the order right, just one DVD !!!"
1,Great Songs but....,I made a mistake and ordered the DVD instead of the CD. Having ordered several other Gaither CDs over the years I just didn't pay attention. My fault. I will probably reorder this as a CD. All the theatrics was just too distracting.
5,Great tea!,"Wonderful flavor if you love cinnamon, which I do! My husband also loves it and he's not much of a tea drinker!"
5,As good as I remembered it to be,Mary Downing Hahn was my favorite author when I was in middle school. I am now a 24-year-old graduate student who recently read a few of them again. Downing Hahn's story lines are easy to follow yet multi-layered and well written. A Doll in the Garden entertained me as much as it did when I was a young girl who craved ghost stories.
4,Pretty good,This book was pretty good just the plot was good ok just feel like the story didn't express as much detail as it should and yeah but other than that it was an amazing book.
4,It wasn't the BEST Mary Downing Hahn books,"This book wasn't the best book she has written. The book ""Wait till' Helen Comes"" was better than this one. But if you like horror go ahead and read this book. It's actually worth the time!"
5,A Doll In the Garden,"Mary Downing Hahn is an excellant writer! All of her stories are a fun, thrilling, mysterious adventure! I would recommend any of books to readers of all ages. She hooks you from page one and doesn't let go until the final word!"
3,"Good Story, TYPOS, TYPOS, TYPOS","Someone recommended this book to me, so I was excited to read it, and I can say it was a great little story. Very easy read, and the story moved well.That being said there is no way to look over all of the typos in the Kindle edition of this book. I believe in rating the product that was delivered. This is a children's book... are they supposed to read over all of those typos? Some of them even confused me... Carrie was called Came, Kristi was called Kristd half the time, and the amount of unnecessary punctuation where someone just didn't hit backspace was ridiculous. This should be an embarrassment to the publishing company, and the author needs to step in and make them fix it!"
3,Too young for me,"This book was not at all scary or suspenseful, and the plot was very predictable and not a new idea. Basically it is about a girl called Ashleigh who moves to an old house and finds a doll in the garden. Later she finds out the doll belongs to Louisa, a sick child. It has quite a good ending but it wasn't a page-turner. 'Wait Till Helen Comes' by the same author is much more spooky and interesting and though they are for the same age group, I think older people would enjoy 'Wait Till Helen Comes' better then 'The Doll In the Garden', which I read when I was 12 and I thought too young for me. People ten and under would probably like it better."
3,Good read with terrible editing,"I enjoyed this book. The characters were well drawn and the dialogue was believable. Although it did not have any twists or surprises, it was still enjoyable. I did not like it as much as ""Wait Till Helen Comes"". My only complaint is with the editing. The Kindle version of the book is filled with typos."
4,Good book!,I love the book because you can never stop reading. I always wanted to know more! I would read this book of you like a good mystery. It is also as little bit scary.
4,The doll in the garden,I would recommend this book if u like mysteries and ghost books. I really liked it! I enjoyed the book and I hope u do too!
2,typos are distracting!,"I read this book countless times as a child and I was excited to read it as an adult. I'm only about 5 pages in, and I've noticed numerous mistakes. Hopefully Amazon will let me return it."
5,Lovely Story,"I originally read this story when I was 10 years old and even though it's nearly 13 years later, I still love it very much. Mary Downing Hahn is an excellent story tellers, especially with ghost stories and other tales with a strangeness to them. This book is no exception and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys ghost stories and fairy tales, though this book would be most suited to those of the age of 9 to 15."
3,Entertaining but forgettable,"I love this author, and I went through a phase several years ago where I read as many of her books as I cound find. This is a good book - certainly you'll be entertained and will enjoy it - but it didn't capture my interest and imagination like some of her other works, like The Jellyfish Season and Wait Till Helen Comes did. I highly recommend those to anybody who liked this book. Something about this book, especially reading it now as an adult, is a little less real and a little more juvenile than some of her other works."
3,The Best Online Book Review EVER,"The Doll in the Garden is a ghost story by Mary Downing Hahn. The climax changes in an suspenseful way when the main character, Ashley, finds a doll that her old, crabby landlord buried in the front garden when she was very young. The doll belonged to the landlord's neighbor and best friend. Ashley's neighbor, Kristi, tells the landlord about Ashley finding the doll, because Kristi was jealous that Ashley kept the doll. The landlord was very angry. Ashley is transported to a parallel world in which she meets the landlord's old best friend when she was young, and very sick. There is a reason she wants her doll back, and Ashley is determined to make the landlord and the little girl in the parallel world meet up again. Ashley takes the landlord and Kristi to the parallel world, and there is a danger of them never being able to go back home. Will they make it home? To find out, read The Doll in the Garden by Mary Downing Hahn."
4,New Mom of One,"I just got this book to read to my 5 month old every night before bed. While there are not many pictures (one on each page), the stories are just short enough to hold his attention. I would recommend this for every parent wanting to start a bedtime ritual with their kids."
3,Did not keep my [...] interested,The stories are really one page snippets from the main storylines of the movies. My [...] was moderately interested in the stories for which he has seen the movies and not very much interested at all in the ones for which he hasn't seen the movies. I believe the main reason he did not find these stories very interesting was because reading a random page from a story book cannot possibly be too interesting for a toddler.
1,cut and paste quickly,This is a bad book. There are no beginnings or endings to each story - they are simply random cut and pastes of the full-length story. I would not recommend this book to anyone!
4,Always a story,A story for everyday of the year. Each story is a page long so don't read it too fast or you will have to read the next days story if your little one is still awake. All disney characters get a part in this book. Nice variety.
1,Don't Buy,"I made a mistake of not checking the description, I bought Andys Gang with Hey Kids thinking it would have more shows. The DVD was just one show and the same show that was on Hey Kids. Buy Hey Kids instead Andys Gang is just a big rip, Hey Kids cost a little more but it has 21 great shows."
2,Disappointed,I was a little disappointed that there was too much of the film about the indian boy and not enough of the actually Andy's gang. I wanted to see all of the character and not just a film insert.
1,What a POS!,"My expectations were quite high, however, Andy was no Smilin' Ed as the viewers will see. There was only one episode, which was really bad. Really sorry I bought this."
1,Don't buy this DVD,"With shipping it cost me over $19.00, and all it is one episode with the Indian boy film in front taking a lot of time off of the total. With a short Andy Devine and Froggy at the end of the DVD. It is not worth it, check out on ""You Tube"" there are several shorts to watch with Andy Devine and Froggy and they are free."
5,AMAZING,"I loved this book. It was a touching and vivid story of two lives crossed by fate. Lucy, a former circus freak, and Emma, a girl who shows up in a mall covered with scale tattoos, who come together. It has love, mystery, suspence, and a group of ""bad guys"" to bring it all together. A must read for anyone."
1,You can't judge a book by its cover.,"This saying definitely applies to this book. I was intrigued by the cover and title of the book and couldn't wait to start reading. Let me tell you, it was a struggle from the first paragraph. However, I dutifully kept reading expecting the story to pick up but it never did. The characters were so boring that I started to root the bad guys on and there was very little plot to get immersed in. Stevens' writing was poor as well. I am sure she could do better. Maybe she had a great initial idea gone wrong.In short, if you really want to read this book, get it out of the library if possible."
4,"Entertaining, yet not quality!!","This book some how relates ... circuses, Jesus, midgets, tattoos, little girls, and all else that is wonderful and funny in this world.A ex... is helping a little girl, that is covered in tattoos, uncover her painful past... and at the same time, unfolds some of her own mysteries.This book is completely un-realistic and a little over the top, but definately entertaining.... and i enjoyed it for what it was. I'd recommend it for a Sunday afternoon no-brainer read."
1,Complete waste of money-no better than the online docs,"I purchased this rather expensive set of texts after reading some ""reviews"", expecting to see an improvement over the dismal online documentation. For all those who have great expectations, forget it. These books are a complete waste of money. They contain the exact information already available in the .Net Framework SDK, and provide ZERO additional useful information. You'd be better off to save the money for the eventual calls you'll need to make to Microsoft to get some real answers. I am not wowed by a lot of pages. It's the information (or lack thereof) that matters."
2,Superficial and repetitious,"I was quite disappointed by this book. Fagan repeats words, phrases, and concepts again and again. He throws out speculative notions without justification, and his grasp of some basic demographic concepts is shaky. I was planning to read his book on Cro Magnon people, but I've decided to give it a pass.The diagrams and maps are sloppily done. Often they don't show the thing they're intended to show. For example, a map of the area in the western US inhabited by several preColumbian groups, Fagan uses a map of all of North America, on the Mercator scale, so that the polar regions are enormous and you can't really see the area the chapter is talking about.Note for Kindle edition: There are lots of endnotes in this book, but there are no active links on them, so you can't read a note without searching through the Notes section for it. I finally gave up trying to read the notes."
5,"All You Want to Know About Climate Change, but Were Afraid to Read","Brian Fagan is considered the quintessential authority on Climate Change and how it affects humankind. But he is so much more. For someone who can't get enough of this stuff, I have never read a history on climate change that is so interesting a read.The Long Summer is a fascinating journey that thrilled me with every page. For the first time, I began to understand the march of history and the people who were affected by these events. That's another thing I love about this book. Dr. Fagan brings the times and the people to life, from the distant past to the near present.If you love history, you will love this book. This is no dusty tome, and I am not a scholar. The Long Summer is a book about people who really lived and survived what may be our own future."
5,Great Lead Character,"This book is a great read! You can't put it down as the plot twists and turns in unexpected directions for the main character, private investigator Corrie McKenna. The author tells the story in living color!"
2,"Too much talks, no maps, few taps","It's an important historical documentary , but if you want to see old taps dancers like showed in the dvd cover, avoid it. There are only few short cuts from genius like Bill Robinson and others and many and many conversations and interviews. Try old videos in VHS or the outstanding afro-american dancers in 'Stormy Weather', a Fox musical from the fourties, available in Amazon."
5,Excellent technical commentary,"This is probably the most helpful commentary that I have on the Pastoral Epistles. George Knight does an excellent job with the Pastoral Epistles explaining not only the meaning of the words, but the relationships between the words and ideas of the text. He deals with difficult passages fairly and draws from and footnotes many other helpful resources. While knowledge of Greek will enable one to get full benefit from this commentary, Knight explains concepts in enough detail for those who do not know Greek to benefit greatly as well."
5,A must have work!,George is masterful in his work. What a pleasure to go through this commentary. A must have for any serious teacher.
4,Cute but dated,"Gift for my sister. It's very funny and was enjoyed. It feels like it's from the 80's though, and I expected that."
5,Add this to Amazon video,I think think this is a very funny show. I really with you can add it to the Amazon video store. My kids will destroy dvd s thats why i stopped buying dvds. Besides dvds are almost played out. Its 2013 almost.
5,Diff'rent Strokes: season 3,"My children and I have watched season 1 and 2 over a zillion times.Come on !what are you waiting for? Release the other seasons pleaseeeee. We want to finish watching, Kimberly, Willis and Arnold grow up."
2,You get what you pay for. Sometimes less.,"This ramp works as described, but that is the only positive thing I can say. There were several rivets which were improperly fastened (I fixed them myself), none of the edges were finished, so I had to take a file to prevent any cuts. The description claims 250lbs., but my 120# pooch causes a slight sag as she goes up. I could not find a sticker noting where this was made, but it doesn't matter, there is no quality control at all."
1,Not for cooking!!,"This pan is thin thin thin! I cant find any ceramic on it. It is painted steel.Title failed to mention This Is Made By Phillipe Richard...I can see why they dont tell you this! The handle has 2 small screws holding it on the pan. My wife says its Pretty.. But she said she would never cook with it. Save your money. Buy a real pan to cook with! If you want one, Go get it at a dollar store!Or put 2 handles on a coffee can!"
3,Wrong Kindle Edition,"In the description it says that the Kindle edition of this book is the sixth edition but the sample I got says fourth edition! I'm glad I didn't buy it right away!Sorry, I had to rate the book. I'm sure the book itself is okay but it is probably outdated and I can't use it for my class."
3,SACD,This album is the same as the original recorded version. This album is in 5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound.
4,New Moon Shine - Excellent,"New Moon Shine is Taylor at his best. The more mature Taylor is just as enjoyable as his earlier work such as JT. My all time favorite is October Road, a must have in your music collection. I just wish this CD had been recorded in HDCD in order to capture the dynamics of the beautiful guitar chords."
5,A great introductory CD to James Taylor,"Having owned Hourglass and, of course, his greatest hits CD, I purchased New Moon Shine to listen to his more recent work and it made me a James Taylor fan. ""Copperline"" is a favorite that sets the mood for the whole CD. ""Slap Leather"" is a sharp, fast rocker along with ""(I've Got to) Stop Thinkin' 'Bout That"". ""Shed a Little Light"", ""Down In The Hole"", ""Oh Brother"" and ""Like Everyone She Knows"" are the acoustic type songs with the backing vocals you see on his several TV specials. My favorite on the CD is ""The Frozen Man"", a song that sends you to the lyric sheet to follow along with the story. If you are thinking about exploring James Taylor after listening to just his greatest hits, this is the CD to listen to first."
1,Does not fit Husqvarna 455,This case does NOT fit the Husqvarna 455 chainsaw. The top won't close with the saw inside. The hinges are just bent plastic and I'm afraid they'll break easily if there is pressure on them.
2,It fits the saw - that's about it.,"I bought this case because the Husqvarna saw (450) I bought would not fit into the generic saw case that I already had - it was too tall. About all you can say about this case is that it fits the saw and seems to be reasonably sturdy. Unlike the cheaper generic saw cases, this case has absolutely no ""compartments"" for oil and the adjustment tool, despite the claim to the contrary. It certainly has ample space for these items however the ""compartments"" it has for that is - just throw it into the case. There are no blow mold clamps or pockets to hold them in place. There is, however, more then ample space to throw several items into the case around the saw assuming that you don't care if the items or the saw bang into one another. Overall I rate the case as adequate - just barely."
4,Pricey but good fit.,"Why this plastic carrying case costs so much (about $50 via Amazon) is hard to figure, considering cases used to come with the chain saws as part of the package. However, they offer good protection and this one is no exception. Fit my 18"" Husqvarna 435 perfectly."
2,not as advertisied,Ordered this and product is good quality however ad is misleading. The picture shows three snaps two on the side and one on the front . It came with only two on the side and none on the front. Next time I will call first to make sure I am getting exactly what I am paying for. With the weight of the saw I think the third snap would really help extend the life on this product.
5,Really useful book for Internal Medicine rotation,"I stumbled upon this book in my medical bookstore and have used it a lot during my medicine rotation. I really like the chapters on the write-up and oral case presentation. The advice is solid. I've been able to avoid some mistakes that I'm sure I would have made had I not read this book. It doesn't cover material for the shelf exam but it gives you everything you need to do well during prerounds, work rounds, attending rounds, on oral case presentations, daily progress notes, and H & Ps. It's only drawback is it doesn't cover information for the shelf exam but the authors' goal are to give you the information you need to get good evals. It definitely meets that goal."
2,Dumas was a lousy usability professor in my MS program,"I had Dumas (one of the authors) for a Testing & Analysis master level class at Bentley College (the semester before he retired; I wish I could have waited, so I actually would have gotten something for my 3000+). He was a horrible teacher, the worst in the program. Reminded me of Ferris Bueller's ""Anyone, anyone?"". I thought this book was redundant and not very helpful. If you already have QA experience, you'll probably find this book a waste of money. It's out of respect for Hackos' work that I'm not rating the book lower."
1,Piece of Junk!,"Purchased as a backup to another D2X SLR 12.4 that had some circuitry go bad. The internal mirrors were filthy; & the shutter release stuck quite badly. The 1st picture taken during each shoot, returned an ""error"" message. Once my primary camera came back from repair, I brought this one in to have it cleaned & to have the shutter release action taken care of. I was told that the cost of repair would be an additional $575.00 (above the original $663.41 that I paid upfront for this ""refurbished"" camera), as there were more mechanical things wrong w/ it than just the shutter release issue. I was royally screwed by this seller; so, purchasers be wary. Hard to think that the seller was unaware of these issues prior to placing it on the market."
5,Nikon D2X,"Adorama(via Amazon)exported this item to Australia in a very nicely prepared package with an MH-22 charger and a brand new wide strap.The camera is in excellent condition with only 18k shutter actuations.I didn't buy this product as my only DSLR but more as a collectors piece, OK as modern DSLR's go it's fairly ""old hat"" but it has fine build quality and still captures excellent images.Probably the price, a fraction of it's original cost when new....prompted me to purchase. I immediately upgraded the firmware to the latest version and put in an EN-EL4A battery from another camera and off it went. I don't think it will take long to up the shutter count a bit!Great buy, good service from Adorama and Amazon and a fine ex flagship product...well chuffed!!"
5,Nikon d2x AWESOME camera!!!,"This camera is GREAT! I had a Nikon d2h and the d2x out perform its predecessor with amazing results! The photos are clear and clean and it is very user-friendly. If you are looking for a true professional DSLR with 12.4 mega-pixels but you don't want to spend a arm or a leg, this is the camera for you! Eventually I will upgrade to a d3x or d4 but for the time being my d2x is good enough for me! Remember, this camera when it first came out(2005) it cost $5000 but now it is affordable! Only things I can say is get it, trust me you won't regret it!!"
2,disappointed fisherman,I bought this as a gift for my husband. He did not care for it very much. We both watched it and it was very boring. Not a lot of actual fishing. Very disappointing.
3,"good for a while, then breaks","I have 3 of these and 2 of them just fell apart after about 2-3 years. It looks like they used some sort of glue that gave way at the base of the threads that the head and base screw together at. Loved the flashlights up to this point, not so much now. Odd that 2 gave way within a month of each other."
1,Poor and a total waste of time,I read the first book at my partners request and was profoundly disgusted. It's quite obvious this person is educated in bridge but his spades examples and techniques are something my dad might talk about.Very little if any of either book is original material. It is just bridge and whist revisted.I advise all to save money and play more in the rated rooms on the zone. You can learn more in one week in the rated rooms that you can hope to get out of this book. If National spades champions exist in the spades world I would love to meet one.Can I get a refund?Rita
1,A Total Waste of Time and Money,"If you have $18 and six months of time , then get this Book. It is boring, confusing and loaded with a lot of useless information - unless you are a Bridge player. This brings the toal pages for both of Mr. Fleishman's books to over seven hundred - and that is just too much for a simple card game like Spades. Save your hard earned cash."
2,Who Let The Dogs Out?,"""Spades For Winners"" was a decent book, and very helpful for the experienced player. Three hundred and forty pages was very long, but the book was still OK. Now we get ""Master Spades"", and the Hounds from Bayonne, New Jersey are howling. The second Fleishamn book is boring beyond belief, and another never-ending three hundred plus pages of pure confusion. Woof woof woof! The Baja Boys advise you to save your money, or to invest in a basic Hoyle book - which will cost you [very little], and do a good job of teaching you the game of Spades...."
2,A BIT DISAPPOINTED,"I ordered this video because of the release date of December, 2002. Little did I realize this is a video from 1963! And that's where the disappointment comes from. The dancers and Johnny were really from the 60's!! Johnny's singing is wonderful as usual, but not from 2002!!"
4,"Tons of software ""to go""","U3 is a great benefit of this drive. It allows easy installation of software to go. If you take your drive to work, school, switch back and forth between a laptop and desktop, this drive is great!With the software you can add a password before anything initiates, creating a secure world for you and your data.I use this drive for my web design and C++ programming files. It reads and writes to the drive very quickly, much faster than the three other thumb drives I own.Pro: Small size, Big storage, switchblade style usb connection, comes with a pocket clip.Cons: Blue light. While this isnt any sort of deal for anyone, its bad to me. I just prefer white, yellow, or UV light. seriously not a big deal though."
2,Not for Macs,"A solid, durable drive. Unfortunately, it's not clear on the packaging that it's not for Macs. However, when you mount the drive, an extra 'CD' drive containing the U3 software mounts as well. I've seen this on other drives that include Windows utilities, but have never had a problem deleting and reformatting the drive to get back that lost disk space.Unfortunately, the Cruzer is not configured this way. On a Mac, you will never be able to get rid of the extra U3 disk that mounts every time you mount the Cruzer, and you will also have to eject BOTH disks when you done using it. Finally, because of this issue, you lose about 60 MB of drive space.So, it's probably a great drive for PCs, but not for Macs."
3,Sandisk Titanium,"Solid and sturdy flash drive. Built-in security software works great with Windows XP and older OS, but can not be use in Winodws Vista."
1,Warning: VIRAL software. Don't buy this device!,"While this could have been a good product, from a company I once considered a top supplier of Flash memory, MP3 players, and other products, this device includes U3 VIRAL software that takes over the host PC and forces itself into the system. The maker, Sandisk, claims that it can be removed, but that is a blatant lie. The software resides on an apparently permanent partition of the device, making the device a 1.9GB storage rather than the advertised 2GB. The accompanying software that is supposed to remove the U3 virus from the device does not even recognize that the device is attached, then fails to remove the offending virus. There is NO WAY to use the device as a normal flash drive.Despite the previous dozens of Sandisk products I own and use, this is the LAST time I'll EVER buy a Sandisk product!"
2,the price is a bit high even on sale.,there are many sites offer sandisk 2GB for about $15. AMAZON lists the price higher than other sites.
5,SanDisk 2 GB Cruzer Titanium,"I ordered this product in early October. Then went on a 2 week vacation. As of today I have not received my order nor have I heard any feedback from anyone. Thinking that it may have been left on the premises or at a neighbors house, Not so since I have checked it all out.Can you help me?Thank you, Paul"
1,"All my files earased, gone.","I've had this for a few months now and it was working great. I loved the sleek metal design and the fact that I didn't need a cover. I thought the U3 software would be a cool feature, but it ended up being an annoyance that I never used at all and may have contributed to the downfall of this device. Just yesterday I notced that all of my important files are gone, earased and the only thing left is a folder of some fonts that I barely use. I am so upset, I lost a lot of work somehow and I don't even know how? This never happened with my SanDisk 128mb mini cruzer.. all of my files/homework from when i was in college are gone along with my senior project I worked so hard on. Luckily I have back ups of other things I had on there but I do not have back ups of my college portfolio work or my project. I just remembered other stuff I had in there that I lost, i don't even want to think about it... I think I'm gonna go cry now.."
1,DO NOT BUY the TITANIUM,"$75 down the drain... If that's your idea of fun, then this is the flash drive for you.My 2 GB Cruzer Titanium worked properly for one day before the U3 software began to cause all kinds of problems with the drive and with my laptop.The U3 Launch Pad Remover does not run correctly, so I am pretty much stuck with a stylishly designed but worthless piece of metal.San Disk troubleshooters refuse to admit that the device is defective. They blame my computer, of course."
4,Good Buy,Great flashdrive. Good for carrying all my school work and carrying picture. The titamium is awesome because iam a bit clumsy. I doubt it can hold 2000lbs but i dont really want to find out. The U3 is just stupid and pointless. It has to install itself on every computer it's plugged into(all my teachers). It only takes like 20 seconds but you have to eject the U3 before you can safly remove it. Great buy though.
5,SanDisk 2 GB Cruzer Titanium Flash Drive,"simple to use, compact, no software to load. will recommend it to everyone."
5,"no complaints, awesome!","it stays in my purse 24/7, and works great. tons of memory for larger files. i just wish amazon offered it instead of an outside vendor, because i had to pay more for shipping."
4,good deal,"So far so good. Before I always had trouble with losing caps. The slide on this one works great. My only complaint so far is the hole for the keychain is too small, and won't let it move freely. Besides that it is a good deal for the money."
5,Don't leave home without it!,"The SanDisk Cruzer is one of the most useful items I have purchased. It is versatile and incredibly easy to use! I liked it so much I bought two! The Cruzer 2 GB would be a perfect gift for anyone interested in transferring or storing any type of files including photos. My Cruzers will pay for themselves, in the cost of blank CDs alone, as I used to burn all of my photos to discs to transfer the pics to other computers! Thanks SanDisk!"
4,Great but....,"I just bought it and it looks very nice and preforms as described. However, since it's ""The Cruzer Titanium"", I expected it to be lighter (it's not heavy) than what it weighs. Other than that, it's an excellent product."
4,Good fast flashdrive,"The 2Gb Cruzer Titanium is a lot smaller than the 500Mb which I also own. I bought 2Gbbecause it was cheaper than half of a 4Gb at the time. I spent too long reading about removing the bloatware that came on it, but removing it was very easy using a program from the SanDisk website. Now that I've removed that, I have a very fast ordinary flash drive. If it had come without the software I would have given 5 stars."
5,"excellent device, but I wish U3 was not installed by default","This thumbdrive is the best one I have used by far. It is physically solid; I use it as a keychain. However, I wish the U3 software was disabled by default... since I use a mac is was a bit of a pain to remove, but worth the effort."
4,Everything is good....,"product is as promised, and works as expected. Sale was both efficient, and pleasant. Would recommend highly....."
4,"Flash drive great, but watch our for U3 program",The SanDisk Cruzer Titanium is indeed sturdy with fast data access speed. However the U3 system installed on the drive requires two drives to operate; One for the operating system and one for data storage. It occasionally happens that a computer I need to use does not have two consecutive available drive letters (E: and F: for example) and I cannot use the flash drive. That is annoying.
2,"Thought it was durable, but has a major weak point!","They say a chain is only as strong as it's weakest link, well I have discovered the flaw with this design which will ultimately lead to you loosing the entire device, especially if you carry it on your key chain. The top corner containing the post that the small guage key ring goes around tends to separate which lets the key ring slip off. Upon analysis of the separation, I found it to be poor workmanship and a weak design considering that corner is a stress point that should be reinforced and NOT separate! Also, the thin guage key ring that's around that corner post is not durable and tends to bend and separate which also allows the unit to easily slip off when attached to a key ring for your keys.I like the metal casing and the pounds of force it can withstand, but the weak corner thing really blows it!"
2,just okay,"Cruzer- I got it on sale at Staples for a good price. Works fine, but two things about it I don't like:1: The U3 Smart software partitions the drive, and you always have this pop-up menu of stuff like Skype and password manager, which you can't delete easily because it is seen as a CD drive (read-only). You have to download the uninstall program from SanDisk, and they make it hard to find. I wasted a good hour on it. Some folks might love the U3 stuff, but I don't.2: The LED stays lit, whether it's seen by the computer or not. You have to pull it out. When you do, it's very warm from the light- that can't be good for the longevity of the drive. But why not have the light indicate that it's recognized as a drive, and not just powered up? Ya got me.The retractable gizmo is nice. Keeps the cookie crumbs out of the works."
4,SanDisk succeeds again (with a little modification),"This product is a great flash drive--solid construction (you can toss the thing around without worrying), the nice SanDisk feature of the retractable plug, and its small and convenient. U3 is a problem--mostly because it eats up ~80MB of space and doesn't work on my Mac. The solution: download the uninstaller from SanDisk's website (which, also, only works on a PC), then uninstall U3 the first time you plug the drive in. You get your space back, and the drive becomes normal.This would get 5 stars if it came without U3, or if U3 was better designed, or if U3 worked on a Mac, or if U3 was just generally better thought out."
2,Be careful,"My recent purchase of the 2GB Titanium Cruzer was a disappointment. Everything worked fine until I tried using the U3 SanDisk software to safely remove the Flash Drive from the USB port. I then, received endless error messages that it was not safe to remove the flash drive. I also was unable to remove the flash drive using the Windows removal option. So, I finally, contacted SanDisk Tech Support only to spend an hour going through the tech's written protocols and consulting with her supervisor to no avail. I was then told to go hire a computer tech to solve my computer problems, along with a euphemistic ""Have a nice day."" Well, instead of paying for a computer tech, I'm returning the SanDisk 2GB for a flash drive that is still compatible with Windows XP. The truth is as several other reviewers of the SanDisk 4GB Flash Drive have pointed out, problems with SanDisk's U3 embedded software and OS/Window XP lack of compatibility and that's the fault of SanDisk's U3 design."
1,DO NOT BUY--Does not have a robust interface,U3 works on some machines and not others. The support from Sandisk is canned and didn't help. The expectation seems to be that the user will either reconfigure the computer they are using (kinda defeats the purpose of having software on your flashdrive so that you don't mess with different computers) or you will uninstall U3 (then why pay extra for it?).This was a waste of money.
5,The best flash drive ever,"It is unfortunate that they do not produce this item anymore. I got one of the few that remain here on Amazon. I use it every day. It is durable and secured. I feel naked without it. If you can get your hands on one, do not let it go. They will become rare soon I am sure."
5,Excellent item,"Unit is solid. And that is important if you have kids that like to play with things. Excellent quality in workmanship. Not too thrilled with the included software. Just make it acessible is all I need.Make sure not to buy this by itself or with something small. The shipping and ""handling"" fees will kill you. Over $12 for this thumb drive and one micro SD card. You lose the ""value"" of the item by giving it back in their shipping fees."
3,"Good drive, but very stiff USB connector","It's a good drive overall, but the USB connector seems just a little bit oversized. I have enormous difficulty inserting the drive into most USB ports, though after I've done that a few times, the computer's port tends to loosen up. It's weird, since I've only encountered this problem with this drive, and no other USB device. Ever. I wouldn't buy it again for that reason."
4,Works for me!,I bought this product because it was on sale and it's been working great. I've had no problems with it. I don't use the U3 software because I find it unnecessary. I also like the look of this USB drive.
3,Product does not match description-Unwanted software,"Hi,I really like the fact that I am getting an opportunity to voice my concerns about this purchase, I am really extremely satisfied with Amazon otherwise.I had specifically ordered San disk 2 GB flash drives WITHOUT U3 software. I don't need U3- I and would rather not have it.The order arrived and I see that all 3 of the flash drives have u3. To confirm I actually went back to my order and checked that the product details make no mention of U3.I am not sure I can uninstall that or not without destroying the drives. I really needed to use the drives at that point of time else I would have returned them.I expect a lot better than this from sellers on Amazon, to send me what I order not foist extra things on me.I would really appreciate it if you can tell me how to uninstall the U3 without harming the data on my flash drives.Thank you"
2,Not the best,"There's no write-protect switch. Also, there's this software on it that starts when the drive is plugged in. Some type of manager. I hate it, and cannot figure out how to get rid of it.I would recommend the Imation drives."
3,Look liked used,"The USB drive itself it's nice and I really like the encryption function. I was a little bit disappointed about the metal material though. Titanium is supposed to be more durable than regular metal, but the one I got looks like used one. I ordered a brand new 2 GB Cruzer from Amazon, but it has many scratches on the surface already when I opened the package. The actual looking is very different from the picture displayed online! I've been shopping on Amazon for more than 3 years and this is the first time that I felt dissatisfied at my Amazon purchase -_-"
1,boo sandisk,I can't believe this brand new product doesn't work with Vista. I was upset I can only use it with my XP at home. Looks cool but it only works with old OS. I think that is super lame.
5,"Works great, a bit pricy","Works great, fast, no issues with U3 (and it can be removed). Looks great, feels great in the hand (not like a cheap plastic thing). Now I'm just worried about losing it."
1,RIP files,"The drive crashed after about a month of service. Worked great until I lost everything stored on it. U3 is cool but there are free alternatives. (PortableApps). Very rugged design and 5-year warranty made me think my data was going to be safe. Well, I lost everything stored on it. Very upsetting. Sorry SanDisk, you get 1-star for losing my work."
5,Best USB Flash,"I gave this flash 5 star because of many things.1- The speed it's faster compare to others like (Kingstone, Adata, Infinity)2- The design of the flash, it's easier to use compare to others and the size.3- It has U3 which is very nice to use.4- The strength of it. I forget it twice in my small jeans pocket and washed in 45c in the washing machine, and worked perfect after that :)I still buy only Sandisk flash."
2,Mixed review,"U3 software will be an irritant to most people, and while it can be removed, it is not well documented.My drive began to give me problems putting it into USB receptacles on some computers, suggesting subtle malalignment of device. Not sure how common this is.Overall, I like the retractable design, and device works fine."
5,SanDisk 2 GB Cruzer Titanium,Great for backup and transfer of data up to 2 GIGS between computers. Second best thing after an external hard drive. I removed the U3 software that I really did not need.Great value at less than 40 % of MSRP.
5,Small package but loads of options,"I purchased this USB drive after my other one was damaged. This little thumb drive really delivers. This was by far one of the easiest USB drives to use. I really like the ease of use. As for storage, it has ebooks and several CD's stored and I still am not even close to filling it to capacity. I highly recommend SanDisk."
3,Solid book for skating course,"This is a good step-by-step book that looks like it belongs for a fall one quarter college course in inline skating. The book is well done and quite helpful, but would be best served in a class with a competent instructor. Not too many illustrations and the word-pictures would be hard to follow on your own. Also a good reference to check technique as you improve."
3,Not perfect,"So they fit correctly, but I'm not sure if I really got Levi's since the tag on the back was gone....all the stitching was there, but the machine forgot to wait for the label before it sowed! Bought 2 different color Levi carpenters and both had the same issue"
3,Quality without durability,"I've been buying these jeans for several years. And buying and buying. Wish I didn't have to buy them so much. They are great for a few wear/wash cycles and then they rip out by the back pockets or the knees. The tool pockets are well designed but again if you use them at work you'll find your tools in your boots too soon. Five stars new, zero stars after twenty workdays. Mister Strauss please address the durability issue. You have a prototype for the best work jeans I've found"
5,Jeans,"Most comfortable jeans I've ever worn! Have a hard time finding my size in the stores, but thank God I can get them online!!"
3,Just not the same...,"I have 6 old pairs of Levi's Mens Carpenter Loose Straight Jeans which I've made last as long as possible but were getting very worn so had to get some new ones. After checking all the local department stores with NO luck, found these here so happily ordered 4 pairs. Now that I have them and am wearing them, I'm not sure why but they are no where as near comfortable as my last Levi's Mens Carpenter Loose Straight Jeans and don't much like them. As another review stated, they are much too form fitting and not relaxed/loose like I was wanting and just not as nice and comfortable as my last pairs.These would be great jeans if they were just made more durable (they DO rip VERY easy!), and much more comfortable as they used to be. :("
2,Can't be real Levis,"These jeans are okay, but they are definitely not what I expected. The Levi carpenter jeans I already owned had the hammer loop which these don't have. Also, the denim these jeans are made from is much thinner than the Levis I'm used to. I also thought all authentic Levis had riveted pockets, these do not. They were very cheap compared to what I would have to pay in the store, and that's exactly what I got, cheap copies of what I'm used to. I wear them, but I wouldn't buy them again. I really have a hard time believing these are the true Levis that I'm used to. They seem like cheap knockoffs to me."
4,Levi's carpenters,"These are the only jeans my husband will wear for work, and they are very hard to find in his size-- glad Amazon has them, but wish they were a little cheaper...good quality"
2,jeans,"they dont make them like they used to. there is no waist. old men like me need some room for the boys, you have to wear these things like you're being split. or use suspenders."
3,"Too heavy on the ""Vegas / Area 51 Sauce""","Granted Daid Thomson provides an entertaining read with ""In Nevada"" but I share some of the other reviewers' distastes. For instance, a couple of chapters (e.g., ""Frankly and ""In the Cards"") felt completely out of place and off topic. One about Frank Sinatra and the other about a bridge tournament. Instead of Frank and bridge tournaments, how about covering the raging battles over land use and the constant clashes between Nevada's cattle ranchers and the U.S. Government? The author does a respectable job of stirring clear of most of the cliches that surround Nevada, but unfortunately not all.The first half of the book is loaded with interesting and useful history like the finding of Spirit Cave Man. However, I got the feeling the author is fixated on moving the story's focus to Las Vegas. Like a first time tourist, he gave into the lure of the city's neon lights."
5,Great value! Played first show with great tone!,"I looked at these heads because I had heard great things about them and felt that Aquarian offered a variety of choices in product design and price. The Response 2 for me was a no brainer. I play in a band that entertains at weddings, bday parties, corporate events, etc. Most of our material is geared for dancing, some rock. After hearing the heads at my first show with them on, I knew they were great value. I used a DRUMDIAL percussion drum tuner to get the pitch I was looking for. I'm told that with the construction of the rim, these should remain in tune for the duration. I got a nice ""bong"" tone out of each that my sound man dialed in very easily. So far, I've had them on a total of a month and a half and the drums remain locked in tune. I'm very pleased with this purchase and will continue to consider Aquarian heads for my next update."
2,"Flimsy, and usless",I bought this chair because my girls really like to feed thier dolls. The dolls would fall right through it so my girls got fustrated an stopped using it.
3,Unfullfilled potential,"Suzie's voice has pop sensibility with a reminiscent and melancholy touch, but the music itself is somewhat bland. If you want a better overall experience, I'd say just stick with Saint Etienne."
2,Doesn't cover all the material,"While this book provides a good overall synopsis of the SAT II it is missing a crucial component- an overview of Descriptive chemistry- this makes up about 30% of teh actual test. some questions in this book are too simple, the questions on the real test are somewhat harder than this but much simpler than those practice questions provided in Barrons' review book."
4,Great movie!,"Great movie. Is this really the only place you can find a copy of Bob Dylan doing ""People Get Ready?"""
4,Spring into action with these,"I hope I can write 20 words about a spring ? I bought these for a 1969 Cutlass and they went right into place without issue. Don't forget to but the rubber isolator that goes on top cuz once you have the springs out you don't want to wait for a USPS delivery from AMAZON that's for sure, you'll never get to drive your classic. I'm always more happy with ANYTHING that NOT coming USPS, because I know I'm not going to be waiting forever !!"
4,Recomend not buying from amazon,"I just received this frame yesterday, and I'm a little upset that there is some scratches on it. The frame itself is REALLY cute and granted there is a purposeful ""distressed"" shabby chic look about it around the outer and inner frame. But the packaging of this item leaves the front open and my frame has 3 additional scratches in BLUE, obviously not intended, on the front of it from the open style packaging. It was obviously rubbed up with other stuff in warehouse. So as I do recommend this frame cause it is cute, go to babies r us and pick it up. Where you can inspect it beforehand and make sure you get one that doesn't have additional wear on it. Its just not packaged well for handling and shipping at all. I'm taking mine to Babies R us for an exchange."
3,Truly Different...And Steve's Fans May Not Like It,"I first heard the tune Serenity on Jazztrax.com and I decided to check out the CD. Yes, this is a very different sound than we have grown used to from Steve Cole. He says that his musical tastes and influences have changed and that is obviously reflected in the music on Spin. Most of the tunes have an acoustic pop/country flair that some of Steve's fans may not find to their liking at all. However, an artist needs room to grow and change, so perhaps as fans we can give the music on Spin a chance to grow on us. By the way, the track Serenity,and the hidden track 30 seconds after the end of Confounded, are perfect examples of Smooth Jazz Chill. They are my favorites on the CD!"
1,Disapointing.......,"I found this cd boring, all 3 other steve cole cd's were great this was not even jazz it was well-played rock."
1,OUCH!,"I own four of his albums (all?) I was disappointed with this one. I usually do not buy a CD w/o listening to it or having it recommended. Prior to Spin, Steve Cole could do no wrong... I do not know what happened here. Since everything a person does can't be a winner, I will give him a chance in the future, as he had three awesome CDs prior to this one (however there will be no carte blanche, I will need to sample the cuts first) but my sincere and humble advice is to wait for the next album."
1,What happened?,"Wow, I also shared the anticipation of cruising down Lake Shore Drive, (Or Sheridan Rd. in the NorthShore) listening to the SMOOOOOTH sounds of Steve Cole. I can listen to ""Stay awhile"",""Love Letter"",""Where the Night Begins""..etc all night long with the top down. Unfortunately, this album is all but smooth, it's too folksy, countryish.."
1,My summer is not the same,"I was expecting to role down lake shore drive with steve cole jamming in my car. Every couple of years that is what I got from Steve. However this year I must play his old stuff because spin is not what i expected. I did not get the feel good funk i'm use to with steve. I know artist must expand their music approaches, but don't do it at the expense of your fan base. I was anticpating rolling aroound chicago with steve being the piper of the chicago skyline. I saw steve play at navy pier last summer and he was outstanding. After spin i hope steve gets back to his jazz funk roots which has their origins from the greatest city in the world CHICAGO."
2,Another lost fan,"Steve,I have been one of your best fans. As a fellow sax player in the biz I can tell you this....After owning all of your other albums I am totally lost on this one. Where is that R and B feel that all of your listeners loved? Where is Brian? Are you just trying to go the Mindi Abair route to sell some CDs? Wow man. What a waste of a 2005 release. Don't buy this CD until you preview it first!"
5,Top Ski Resorts of the World,"Fantastic photography, great coffee table book to look at any time that you can't get to the mountains. I'm going to try and work my way through all the resorts mentioned and cross them off progressively from my dream list."
4,Top Ski Resorts,Informative of the ski resorts and areas. Great pictures! Needs to be reedited though. My copy had 10 duplicate pages.
1,I haven't received my purchase!,I ordered this book last November and still haven't received it 3 months later. Tracking the number has led me to blank pages. How can I ever trust buying from Amazon again???
4,don't let it slip away,Great comp with Lindisfarne ace Alan Hull leading the way. Great late 60's and early 70's stuff. Well worth the $$ for a disc comp.
5,Hoppy,"Timeless old westerns from the 40's that any young kid will love. You got your good guys and bad guys, and the good guys win. Then your kids can reenact what they just watched and have a fun time."
5,Great performance of a great ballet,"Giselle was the first great Romantic ballet and it has deservedly remained in the mainstream ballet repertoire since its premier both because most great ballerinas love to dance the title role and also because of the extraordinary beauty of its music. There have been several fine recordings of Giselle but many are abbreviated, whereas this recording is complete. Furthermore, I have never heard Giselle conducted as beautifully as Richard Bonyge conducts it on this recording. If you love great ballet music, or simply great music from the Romantic era, I beg you to acquire this version of Giselle while it is still available."
1,Terrible Service from Amazon.com,"If you want to buy anything through amazon.com I would recommend not doing it. Not only did they send us the wrong watch, they told us that it was ""IMPOSSIBLE"" to get the watch we ordered and paid for, but that for $225 more we could buy the watch through watchzone.com. Never use this service"
5,beautiful music,If you want relaxing Christmas music then I highly recommend this. The music is so peaceful and relaxing. Plain and Simple II is good also.
1,Only the transfer can be rated.,"This rating, which should be NO stars, is for the transfer, not the work. Whatever the film was in 1949 we have no way of even guessing. This product, which must be dozens if not hundreds of transfers removed from the original, is all but illegible. Most of the subtitles are completely washed away. Which is an apt metaphor, as this pirated copy seems to have sat in a wet basement for years before Amazon mailed it to me in one of those cheap plastic cases with a white sticker for a label.[...]"
1,zero stars for print quality,"I confirm the first review, which I did not read before purchasing. This print is inexcusable and should not be sold. Don't buy."
3,Okay for country,"This book is good if you really want to play in C6th tuning. I thought I did, but I found it rather limiting and too old time country sounding. I prefer G tuning. There is some information about forming minor chords, but if you are looking for boxes or fretboard diagrams of minor chords, you are out of luck. Minor chords are presented in music terms, with an example of Dm in the tab, and the instruction to flat the 3rd to form other minor chords. I believe there are many people out there who know that you flat the third. It would be nice to have a diagram that shows you the basic locations instead of having to figure out where the third of a chord is located on the fretboard. After all, the minor chord formations form a pattern on the fretboard."
1,You've got to be kidding???,"A rehash of old material. It is sad indeed that I had to give it a one star rating just to make this point. My rating is ""O"". It is good that I had the opportunity to skim through this book before buying it."
5,Amazing Insightful work,This book is the best book I have read since the 'Complete Book of Witchcraft' by Dr. Buckland! This author is well read and has an wonderful writting style that appeals to both the attuned practitioner as well as the (serious) novice. This book gives you step by step instruction to take the beginner all the way through to being able to understand and carry out complex magickal work. I am pleased to have purchased it!
1,duh,"any author would get a 5 star rating if their own mother and close friends wrote the review to their book. duh, such reviews don't entice me to buy the book as the review can be biased toward the author."
1,Thirteen Spiritual Laws???,I believe that Reclaim the Power of the Witch has confused the thirteen principles of wiccan belief as thirteen spiritual laws. These thirteen principles have been given in previous books written on witchcraft. Why should I buy another book with the same material found in other books on the subject????
1,Warhead,Warhead was the worse movie that David Janssen has ever made. The story line and acting was very bad. I would not suggest this movie to anyone.
3,It does not have all the books examples available,"I like the book. It is one of the only Scilab/Scicos books available. However the back cover and the publishers review says ""All codes used in the book are made available to the reader"" There are not any Scilab codes that are available and the ONLY available codes are Scicos examples for chapter 7. It looks like the authors of the Scilab part of the book thought it was too much effort to include any code on the books web page."
3,A well-edited record collection.,"I have to admit, I liked this EP more before I learned that the title track is a flagrant rip of Gershon Kingsley's ""Hey Hey"" -- all RJD2 did is slow it down a bit. For all the hype this guy's getting, no one's busting him on the apparently uncleared samples. A truly remarkable DJ would have done more to make his sources a little less obvious."
5,My all-time fave,"I am a big Chanel fan, however, I am not really looking for a strong perfume scent. I love the lightness of the scented lotion. It's luxurious and consistently a favorite in my daily repertoire."
3,Very long and dry,"This book is really long. Though the title is ""Applied C: An Introduction and More"", the ""more"" part of this seems to be emphasized. For anyone looking for a simple intro to C, look elsewhere. For those who want a comprehensive study, this might be the book for you."
2,misrepresented but fun,"These blocks are fun to place on a wall or for play, but the letters are NOT cut out as shown, in their actual letter shapes. they are rather clumsily cut out as general shapes which have no relationship to the letter, so once they're out it's difficult for a child to figure out and learn which one goes where. if they were cut out properly i'd give it 5 stars"
4,Surprisingly Delightful,"I love Patricia Polacco but when I read this story, I thought it lacked in originality. The bear hunt has been done again and again, and for me, Polacco is so much more wonderful and orginal than that. However, as the goats approach the fair, and then the funhouse mirror, the fun really starts, especially for my 2 and a half year old. He can't get enough of this book! As the pages turn and the ogre gets nearer, he can hardly contain himself! It is so much fun!"
5,Spectacle of Empire,"Excellent book in excellent condition; well researched and written, about a French welcoming drama in the New World in the early 1600s - a fascinating, little known aspect of history in Nouvelle France that sheds light on a little known European tradition."
4,cherie,The table and chair set is great! My 2 year old enjoys sitting at the table to eat her meals. The only complaint I have is when I received the set it was very dirty (full of rusty spots). I had to thoroughly clean it which most of it came off. I recommend this little table and chair set for toddlers it's perfect for their size.
4,Great for little ears!,"I purchased these earrings for my infant daughter. Since most earrings are too large in my opinion for a 3 month old's ears, this was the perfect solution. As my daughter likes to lie on me when taking a short nap, the first earrings she had poked into me and it was uncomfortable for me. These are small enough not to bother me.The prongs do cover a bit more of the diamond than is shown in the pictures, but they are still very cute. I also like the backs, as they screw on to the posts, and are nice and safe for baby's head."
1,No help what so ever from seller,"I ordered these earrings Nov. 15th, 2012. By December 1st, when I had not received them I contacted the seller by email. I received no reply. On December 3rd, I cancelled the order. I still received no reply, even though I had emailed the seller approximately 5 times. I finally had to get in touch with Amazon's customer service to have them cancel the order and get my money back. I will never order from Fred Meyers again."
4,Very nice for a baby,"Was very happy, bought these for my god daughter who was 6 mths old. They are perfect starter diamond studs"
4,Great product!,Great earrings! picture is misleading as far as the size of the earrings but other than that its a great buy......
4,Thank you for the translation!,"Not only does Thomas C. Kennedy capture the story of Beowulf with page-turning suspense and great storytelling, the words carry a continuous meter without giving in to boredom (like some translations have executed). His preface gives an interesting account of the Anglo-Saxon language, history, metaphors, linguistics, and comparisons to contemporary Fantasy, all within seven pages of interesting reading. Also, notes at the back determine certain word origins, the words best kept in a good translation. And the mead hall is given a proper name ""beer hall"". Let's face it, reading needs to be fun, as well as entertaining, and this translation is excellent."
3,NCLEX-RN Flashcards Flip-O-Matic (Flip-O-Matic),I think this book is good. It is a little boring to me thou. It does have a lot of meds that you need to know for that prepose it is a good book to get
2,lack of information,"The website does not Specify that this book is strictly on medications. The manner in which the book is put together makes is too easy to mistake one medication for another, you MUST read the directions on ""how to use this book."" It does not say how or why they choose those medications. Not recommended."
2,bad organization,poorly organized ....the drugs are classified by action and not alphabetically so if you are not sure what a drug does yet and are just doing a general search it is virtually impossible also the page setup really sucks
3,NCLEX med review book,"I have to say this book is okay, but it's not as good as I expected it to be! But I do think overall it will be a helpful tool in studying for the NCLEX!"
3,It does the job...,"This is a great invention. However, despite the claim that you can put water in the bottom to hold the bottom down, it leaks. At least mine did. Mine won't even hold sand, even though it was supposed to do that too. The seams on the tubing at the bottom all ripped - not an occasional tear, but the entire thing popped open - and it seems inevitable because of the construction. I complained but never got around to returning it for a replacement. The seller told me it wasn't reasonable to expect it to hold water - even though the directions say it should - so I think you should expect a hassle if you want it to do that. And you absolutely should fill it up outside the first time if you try to fill it with water. I couldn't do this and it was a mess. Without water, I don't have any problem with it blowing around - but it doesn't look very gazebo-y. It does keep the mosquitoes out though and that was the reason I bought it. It also has handled several storms quite well."
3,"Meh, I suppose","Meh, is the best description. It does work, and it's about 200 times cheaper than actually building a screen room. But the water tube is useless - it leaked from day one. On day 14 I went to refill it, and instead of the cap coming undone, the whole cap assembly ripped out. Now I have a spring clamp holding the plastic closed. The screen will not hold black flies out, so I sprayed it with Permethrin - that seemed to do the trick.It's also awkward to take down, but if you leave it up with the umbrella down, it still blows over in the storms. My solution to this - see customer pictures above, is to take an old parasol and remove the material, string rope between the splines, and put the net over that actually pretty nice as you can see the sky now.Still, if I can get a season out of it sitting outside when it's still over 70, I guess the price I paid is pretty good value."
5,Inspirational!,Majestic hymns sung with British accents. A great combination! I haven't noticed any objectionable sounds on my copy.
5,Highly recommended!,"This two disc rendition of church hymns is very well done. The sound quality of the individual presentations is excellent. I wish only that the full lyrics to each hymn were included, but that really is a small oversight."
5,Tears and romance,"A beautifully written romantic tale about second chances, loyalty and a friendship between Angus and Karen which leaves you believing in their love and committment to each other.I haven't read the other books in the Tales of the Order series yet and did not feel that they were essential to this story. The relationship between the characters was emotionally intimate and nurturing, and whilst they did make their way to the magical shire and met some characters from the rest of the series, they were each in their own way outsiders to The Order and had no familiarity or relationships with them, after all Angus had not been a part of it for over 300 years and Karen was an outsider.For me this story evoked tears, sighs and smiles. Definately a keeper."
4,"Good old dutch ""Palingsound""","The Cats are (or where) a band from the Dutch city of Volendam. If you like songs with clean guitar sounds and strong melodies this is a good cd to buy. The song Rock n' Roll is about the life of a band on the road and the emotional rollercoaster it can be.Also their biggest hit ""one way wind"" is worth listening to.They have a very unique style which in their native Holland is being called Paling sound, this because Volendam has a long tradition in fishing. (Not really sure what that has to do with music but hey, I just give you the facts)."
1,Marc Posa is right!,"After viewing part of this video, I felt that Marc Posa who wrote the first review for this film was correct about it's poor quality. Not only is it a low budget 5th generation copy of a VHS tape, the film pauses frequently for some reason.Furthermore, there is no scene selection nor is there a main menu for this DVD."
1,don't purchase this bad dvd,"I bought these two dvds ('le Rouge et le Noir' , and 'Diable au corps'), and regret having done so. The copies are awful, like fifth generation Vhs copies. I basically feel it's outrageous to charge any money for this 'product' at all."
1,The Red and the Black,This version is terrible. The actors are good but the sound is off. The mouth movements are not synced with the sounds. I feel a little cheatedon this deal.
3,Taste like a protein bar,I'm not a fan of the taste of this bar. It tastes too much like a protein bar to me. The icing on top does not help at all with the flavor. They are really healthy and a quick snack. This is just not my favorite flavor of bar.
3,Nature's Path Optimum Energy Bar,"Although I liked the consistency, I found this product too sweet for my taste. The over-riding flavour is sugar, not fruit. If you are looking for something for dessert, this would be it!"
4,good nutritional bar.,"the optimum blueberry flax soy energy bar is a satisfying snack that will keep you from feeling hungry for a while,so by not being hungry you don't have much if any loss of energy to slow you down. However, I really think the bar is more of a nutrition bar; it's nutritional value is quite good. Though the bar tastes good, I was a little disappointed that there is only a little blueberry taste. And, since I don't have much of a sweet tooth, I scrape off the drizzled icing - which comes off easily -because it is a bit too sweet for me. I still eat the bars when I can get to them before my children. They love them."
5,Vegan Organic Kosher Choice [Blueberry],"Vegan. Organic. Kosher. [Review of blueberry flavor.] Soft delightful energy bars containing organic rolled oats with wild blueberry pieces inside. Topped with delicious icing swirls. Sweet, but not overly so. Nicely balanced. 200 calories, 6g protein, 5g of fiber per bar. Very satisfying. This review is for those out there for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews and the vegancompassion Profile for more great choices.

3,Not bad...,"They're not bad, but I don't think I'd get them very often. The peanut butter and orange chocolate are much better."
5,My favorite children's book,Let me endorse the other reviews. This book is fun to read. Kids and adults love it. My 7 year old and 4 year old have it memorized and we still read it frequently. Piggy in the Puddle holds up under thousands of readings.
4,Difficult to muddle through the rhymes,"This book is definitely fun to read, if only I could get through it. The rhymes are so silly and fun that my niece can't sit through the book without repeating the rhymes and ignoring the rest of the story. It's cute but it's difficult to get through the whole thing. We get a lot of books for my niece but this is rarely one of the ones she asks us to read to her."
4,Mit Gash,"Being a huge fan of the avant-garde genre, I was personally expecting more to this album coming from Patton. That is not to say the album isn't fullfilling, just not to Patton's typical approach of music. Then again, being un-typical is what he's known for. If that makes sense. This album is more put together and accesable to most. Think of Mr. Bungle's ""California"" album with a darker atmospher, with a slight more edgier sound. The last song, and personally my favorite, on this album is one of the more experimental songs. Compared to others such as ""Rape This Day"" which is more of a straight forward rock structure. Overall, this album is worth purchasing if you are a fan of Experimental, creative music - but their first album is the one worth checking out if you are more drawn to Patton's strange side."
5,Quintessential Mike Patton,"Attention Faith No More and Mr. Bungle fans, this may well be the epitome of Mike Patton music. Yet unlike most commercially recognized MP projects, this one takes a little more investment to reap the reward. While the Tool meets Radiohead in a dark alley aesthetic is immediately apparent, it is the greatness between the lines that makes Mit Gas extraordinary. Every tune resonates with Patton's intelligent observation of the grotesque, bizarre and beautiful. From the nearly West-Side Story ""You Can't Win"" to Stephen Hawking vocals describing the ""Basic principles of hand to hand combat,"" this is Mike Patton at his best. Strap yourself in. If not immediately, then in good time. This is the future now."
4,mit gas,"i like this album a lot it. lots of melodic change yet to keep your feet tapping. like any good album, it takes time to really appreciate. rape this day is my fav right now"
5,The finest band o earth at the moment,"Tomahawk released its first album in 2001. If you ask me, it was the ""Album Of The Year"". The album's third song ""Point and Click"" happened to be the best song of the year. Well, they've ovbiously done it again, since this clearly includes the best stuff I've heard so far this year and ""Captain Midnight"" is by far the most amazing song in a while. It is hard to judge wether Mit Gas is really better than the debut album. It is quite not as rock-orientated as the first one. The Guy who sold me the album said it is better than the first one since it sounds less like Faith No More, but you can hear FNM especially on ""Rape This Day"". Not just for Faith No More fans, but for anyone willing to experience great music with open minds."
1,Break this band up,"After buying there self-titled album, which was decent, I had high hopes for this album.This is not a good album. ""Rape this day"" is the only half-way listenable song here. I cringe to think that Mike Patton went from Faith No more, to this. Do yourself a favor and let this one collect dust on the rack."
5,Mit Gas,"This is a fantastic CD. Just the right mix of the weird and the conventional. It is easy to listen to, sing along, and get into, but don't worry, it will still scare the straights."
4,Brilliant,Has the same awesome sound that Tomahawk's debut album had. Patton is brilliant. I'm only up to the 5th song (rotgut) and it's a satisfying album. Only flaw was I expected the flashdance cover to be on the album but it appears to have been cut. No biggie. Patton is the greatest vocalist on the face of this earth then and now.
2,Bad Patton,"Loved Faith no more and Mr bungle and Fantomas but cannot get into Mike Patton's other, other project Tomahawk. Tomahawk falls somewhere in between his other bands. Its not completely insane like Bungle or Fantomas, but doesnt rock out or empower you like Faith no more either. Its just wierd, but unengaging and boring wierd."
2,"TIRED,REHASHED, NOT IMPRESSIVE","What a shame that Mike Patton has given up on Faith No More and Mr. Bungle for this...The 1st Tomahawk album was great but this effort is sad and tired..For those wondering what a bad Faith No More album would sound like check out this album....Horrid production, Mike's vocals have bad effects, for some reason he doesn't sing into microphones anymore without using samplers..2 good songs and it is no coincidence that they sound liek songs from Mike's more original and more successful bands..'Rape This Day' is like Digging The Grave Part 2 which makes it great and 'You Can't Win' sounds like it could go on the Mr. Bungle debut album..Everything else isjust filler"
4,keep going,"At last something to split the skull of hard rock with. The talent of mister Patton is so vast and, what' s important, soooo enjoyable. One star down though - the eponymous debut does it for me better on the whole, I usually come to skip some passages on Mit Gas, but no big deal, I am an addict all the same."
4,tomahawk has made a very good album,"this band is doing things, writing music that is new and fresh. A lot of bands just put out the same junk over and over again. this is a good purchase if you like hearing new ideas from good musicians."
1,Watch failed Oakley could care less,"I had the black version, the black came off, watch looks ridiculous, can not be worn, Oakley said too hard of use. Come on, Unitonium, rubs off on clothes, worst quality watch I ever owned, over five hundred bucks, Oakley offered no help, told me to buy another one, never again."
4,Good Read,First let me tell you that this not a scifi book.It is however a very good and well written story.It grabs your interest from the start and keeps to the end.I no longer buy books because I find most reviews are misleading.It seems to me that these reviewers purchase books and find thy got took.So in anger thy write glowing reviews to sucker in others to waste there mony.I read reviews on books then if I can find them at the Library.I read the first 25 pages if by then it has not grabbed my attention I let it pass.I find that to many authors start out good then fill there pages with so much discriptive detail it detracts from the story.I also find that most books over 300 pages are loaded with just page filler that has nothing to do with the plot so beware when purchasing a book.I find anything written by Harry Harrison is good.
5,Elsie's True Love (Life of Faith),This book is part of a series of books and my daughter and I just can't put them down. They are really good!!Excellent reading material for anyone. Elsie is a really good example of trusting God.
4,Pale is pure Toad The Wet Sprocket folk-rock excellence!,"Just like ""Bread And Circus"", ""Pale"" is a less-known, probably underrated Toad album. A couple of songs, including ""Corporal Brown"" and ""She Cried"", have excellent, slightly melancholy tunes and lyrics. For a few dollars, you can get a used copy here and enjoy 11 tracks of peaceful, relaxing Toad-rock!"
4,A near-perfect score!,"Hanz Zimmer isn't my favorite composer, but he really knows how to make some great film music. Crimson Tide, The Lion King, and The Rock are just a few examples of his musical capabilities and his intelligence. Here, in ""The Thin Red Line,"" the film showcases more of Zimmer's musical genius. With the film totaling 170 minutes in length, the composer is able to create dark, tranquil, and ethereal pieces throughout. My favorite track (actually, EVERYBODY'S favorite track) is ""Journey to the Line."" It's some of the most powerful music I've ever heard; it's a growing realization of the darker side of human nature.It's true that this CD cuts out numerous minutes of Zimmer's score. I wish they released it as a 2-CD set, then we would have at least the complete score in our collection. But anyway, it's an astonishing score, and it fits perfectly with Terrence Malick's masterpiece."
5,The Best Music of All Time,"Perhaps the best, most haunting, poetic music you'll ever hear. I personally recommend both this awe inspiring & angelic score and Terrence Malick's superb motion picture. Easily the best original score of 1998."
5,"stirring, ethereal, beautiful soundtrack fits the film","contemplative score moves subtly through mind and body. wonderful use of strings, which are interwoven and layered to form a beautiful body of work that evokes profoundly the themes in Malick's film. atmospheric, brooding, terrific. this score, added to the cinematography is what makes the film such a deep immersion of the senses. standout track no. 3 builds to stirring climax. best, most restrained work of zimmer's career. great album."
5,Beautiful Score that acompanies great movie.,"This is a truly great score that brings out the best of the movie. Hans Zimmer has placed himself next to James Horner and Randy Edelman in my eyes, and I look forward to getting the next soundtrack that he composes. If you like soft, weepy music, then this is the cd for you."
2,Zimmer's lesser pieces,I was a bit disappointed with Zimmer's score on this particular soundtrack. There weren't any driving themes or rhythms. Just ambient Zimmer... Where did the main film theme go anyhow? It's not on this album...
3,"Nothing striking about this, just background music","This is not a particularly bad score, it just doesn't have anything ""moving"" in it. The music has a consistent mellow stream that exists throughout the whole cd. Like I said, it isn't bad, but there's nothing here to take your breath away."
3,Where is the movie's theme song ?,"The only reason that made me buy this CD was to have the chance to listen whenever I wanted to the beautiful native acappella theme that graced my favourite movie of the year. I waited for this CD for 2 weeks just to listen to that song and what I found out ? It's not included. This SUCKS !!! It's as if you made a soundtrack Cd for ""Rocky"", ""Star Wars"" or ""The Godfather"" not including the themes that make us think about those great movies as soon as we hear them. The CD is good, but if I had known that ""Village Chant"" was not included in the soundtrack I would have never bought it !"
3,CAUTION:Read This!,"When I purchased this album I was excpecting a more martial album, more fast. This album of course is pretty good. The chant in the trailer is not included and I don't think the drum solo is either. This album is not to be denied because if you ignore the repetiveness of the songs in this album and the wierd synthesized song at the end titled ""Sit Back and Relax"" this album is very pretty. Zimmer has put upon us a very haunting and sad album.Its surrealness makes it a bit mysterious and a hard to stop listening to. The worst part of this album is the chanting in track 2. Get this album its a learning expierience buying this album. Get it now!"
3,What's on it is good but it could include more.,"I bought this cd wanting the music that was included in the trailer for the movie. The same music was used in the movie but not included on the cd, so while what's already on there is nice, I'm still rather disappointed. Still pretty good though."
3,Not the usual Zimmer score that you'd expect,"Unlike Crimson Tide, Backdraft, Black Rain, Broken Arrow, The Rock, etc.. the soundtrack for Thin Red Line was a disappointment. It was a cross between John Williams (Boring) and Jerry Goldsmith (Even worse). It lacks the slickness and the action/dramatic theme that is Hans Zimmer's trademark. A letdown except for 'Journey to the Line' which is slow, but superb."
4,Satisfyingly Haunting,"Rich texture, wonderful to listen to. One of Zimmer's best I feel. A great soundtrack to a great movie."
4,Required Reading to begin a Mentoring program,If you are looking to begin a new program or are new to mentoring this is an excellent resource for anyone.
4,Nice book on Russian adoption,This is a nice book about a baby being adopted from Russia. It uses pictures and terminology that adoptive parents will be familiar with. The pictures are good and the story line kept my 6 yr. olds attention.
4,A great look at eastern european adoption from the inside...,"My children were adopted from Kazakhstan and this is the first book that really showed the adoption experience we had. I read it to my daughter and it prompted all kinds of questions about our experience that she never raised before.I think it's a great addition to our ""adoption"" library."
3,Quick and to the Point,Don't expect verbose treatment and lots of stories. The work is just what the title says: an academic attempt to predict military expenditure and resultant power base as of 1995. Probably a useful research tool for Asian studies for a few more years.
4,Quieter than my old fan,"and keeps the CPU 10 degrees cooler! Wow. A little involved to install, as you have to completely disassemble your existing PC to replace the CPU fan, but no biggie if you are making a new PC."
2,Yet again old body/new clothes?,"It's hard to know with such a poor presentation of the product by Amazon, but it appears that all of these Pussycat CDs seem to be nothing more than the ""gold"" stuff with a new cover.But without a more detailed content description, who's to know? And not one of these iterations contains all of the Pussycat selections from the 70's/80's. I've got the cassette from the 80's and there's more to it than these CDs are offering."
1,Same as online documentation - save your money,"I have been using and developing htmldb (or application express) applications for the past 8 months. I needed something more than the online documentation, such as creating custom reports that go well beyond those available in the Oracle documentation or, for example, using FCK Editor as an HTML editor for text areas, or issues related to uploading and downloading of documents using html db. This book is a total repeat of the online users guide and 2-day dba. You can print the 2-day dba, 2-day developers guide and the users guide and you will get far more useful information than in this guide. This guide contains very little additional information from the documentation that comes with application express. What a total waste of money."
1,There goes the bandwagon....,"To compare APEX (formerly HTMLDB) to .NET is like comparing a ready-made-sandwich to a gourmet meal. One (APEX) is a web-page generator with extensions, the other (.NET) is a bona-fide development environment. To suggest otherwise is at best disingenuous. That said, HTMLDB has a niche. This is the first book available and it is essentially a rehash of the online documentation. It says a lot when the author posts his own review and gives it 5 stars... next.."
4,good book for beginners,good book for html db beginner developers. many GUI and detail instructions you can follow to develop your own application. very easy to read and play on your own.
4,My developer likes it,"I am the DBA at our shop, so I typically don't have time to delve into the application books. However, one of our developers using HTML DB has been using this book and told me to order more copies for the other developers. he finds the book much more helpful than HTML DB online help."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A new prince must deal with his political rivals, and also with his new wife, attempting to keep his domain stable and protected.This proves problematic due to scheming of various powerful figures around him. His wife's magical powers are of some aid in helping him in this area.Definitely on the romance end of fantasy."
4,Good Book,"This book has everything that a good fantasy book should have. Action, romance, comedy, good guys, smart and evil guys, the whole nine yards. If you are looking for a good book to read, this is one you won't regret!"
1,Hated it.,"The characters are totally unconvincing, and the story is predictable. Melanie Rawn is a truly great author, but if this had been the first book of hers I had read, I would have never known it."
1,"Not bad, for a first attempt---not good enough, though.","This was one of those comemorable first attempts that should have been a blueprint to the author of what NOT to do. It's an ok, unoriginal story, but if this had been the first Melanie Rawn novel I encountered, I would have been GREATLY discouraged from reading another. In any case, it's definitely not one fo those books I'd ever read twice, more the kind that would make me shudder were I to pass it again."
3,INTERESTING,"The book is extremely interesting to read, very entertaining, but may not be suitable for children. However for adults who are into fantasy books, this is worth a read. I wouldn't advise you to buy it, see if you can get it from the library."
5,The most spectacular display of writing.,"I think Melanie Rawn's books are positivley spectacular. In this bookshe ties in all the important points of writing, drama, suspense, surprise, politics, comedy, and realisticpotrails of characters and places. I would tell anyone that this book is a number one, top of theline, best-seller!"
2,Disappointed,"I kept hearing about this series and how well Melanie Rawn writes yet, while reading this book I found myself constantly skimming the pages. I really struggled to finish this novel.I found the romance between the leading characters to be unoriginal and simply boring. I found Rohan to be too perfect and excruciatingly dull. I also thought that Rawn's attempts at sexual chemistry between the characters was mere child's play. I should warn you that while the book advertises dragons as major players, they are in reality background props. This is not a book worth buying."
5,An all time favorite,This series was superbly done. There is both character development and world-building that is believable. The characters are human and flawed and immensely likable for it. One of my all-time favorites.
5,Superior,"This book was wonderful, as were all of the books in the series and Melanie Rawn's other books(if you liked this one, read ""The Ruins of Ambrai"", ""The Mageborn Traitor"", and ""The Golden Key""). I immediately liked the characters and related to them and by the end of the book I was obsessed with them. I really liked the way the characters weren't just ""good"" or ""bad"", but a realistic and somehow compelling mix of both. An excellent book that i can't believe only has a rating of 4. It's definatly a 5 star book!"
4,fairly good,"I enjoyed it, even though the author added alot of unnecessary details, and it got really long towards the end."
3,Average but readable - I would read it again. In 10 years,"This is a good book. If you are interested in a better fleshed out plot and stronger characters ready the Janny Wurtz/Raymond E Fiest ""of the Empire"" trilogy. I found some common plot threads through the two series which really annoyed me.In regards to the book itself, the beginning is two slow and drags in several parts of the novel. A nice environmental touch to it as well. In several places their are minor inconsitencies with the characters and ""glossing over's"" of some major points which I found irritating in hind-sight.I borrowed the book, and if you want to read it, i suggest you do to."
3,liked it but...,"Well I can agree with both the good and the bad reviews (not all of them though). I thought that Rohan was hardly guilty of rape or adultry like some of the readers have commented. MOre that he was the rape victim just as Sioned was. Some readers have stated that having sex doesn't nessarily make a woman, true but that doesn't meen everyone shares that thought.Alot of biased readers out there give her a hard time for her first attempt. I agree that it wasn't the best book in the world but it was hardly the worsed. She diffinately needed to work more on her male characters and it's still apparent from reading her other books that she still needs to work on it some more.A good read but I wish that she'd get rid of her political biasism and I wish other readers would stop making stupid assumptions about an author being racist or not. None of us have met her and to judge that based off a book is simple dumb."
1,"I would have given it zero stars, if that were an option.","Not only were the characters shallow and annoying (personally, I found Rohan to be arrogant and pretentious), but a big part of the plot was implausable. I have one word to say in regards to that: inflation."
1,not for readers with somewhat discriminate taste,"Ich, that's all i have to say. ""Love"" based on nothing more than a magicked destiny, dragons thrown in like legal reforms, villains with the whole maniacal laughter getup.....Reads like one of those cringe-worthy plotless young adult novels meant as pander for hormone-raging, socially unbalanced, desperate and sex-deprived teenagers. complete lack of actual legitimate, meaningful content. not even worthwhile as escapist fiction, because it strains so hard at posing as a real look at human nature. a sad attempt."
2,Talent marred by politics,"When I buy a fantasy book, it's to ecape our world, not read political opinions of fantasy writers. While I give credit to Miss Rawn for her talent it's sad that she had to ruin a good fantasy story, and well crafted world by turning the final book into a political document. If I had known that the purpose of her books was to promote a Pro-choice / Anti-Church agenda, I never would have given Miss Rawn a dime. This is a good example of how to lose readers, both for the author and the publisher."
1,Reading this provided many dull moments.,"Someone recommended this book to me, and I thought he had taste. Until I read it. Rohan and Sioned's relationship did seem like it came right out of a romance novel, and pretty much digusted me. Granted, it got better by the end, but give me a break! Rohan himself was pretentious and arrogant, with his same thoughts repeated over and over throughout the book. Give me something new! not the same thoughts repeated in different words. The last five or ten pages seemed like a waste of paper, and believe me, it wasn't a big finish but a dull anti-climax. The book would be better if the editor had had more guts. Cutting out a few repetitious sections would have been a huge improvement. And all the references to sex seemed very juvenile in my opinion. So, if you're fifteen you might like it, but for those of us with more demanding tastes: it's a waste of time!"
1,"Move over, Barbara Cartland!","I can't believe I wasted my money on this piece of trash. It seems to me that Ms. Rawn simply wrote a girlish romance novel and dropped it into a fantasy setting. If you like Fabio, then this book is the one for you!"
2,why all this trouble over one book?,"i didn't find it either as magnificent or as troubling as some of the other readers did. just boring. there was nothing that made me want to keep reading it. frankly, it bored me to tears. the characters were ok, if cliched. the reactions and actions were unrealistic. if it weren't for the fact that the author obviously went to a lot of trouble to think this up, and did take some risk, i'd have given it one start, to reflect personal enjoyment."
2,Hmmm.. Fantasy/Romance by numbers.. Pass,"I read this book many years ago as a child and loved it. Reading again as an adult however has highlighted the single dimensional characters and the weak plot. I guess if the idea of a Sword and Sorcery Harlequin novel appeals to you then it may be worthwhile. Ann McCaffery reccomends this series, no more needs to be said."
5,I'll remember this book forever,"The perfect fantasy romance. That's what comes to mind whenever I think of this book. It reminded me of Robin McKinley's ""The Blue Sword"" and ""The Hero and the Crown.""I'm not a romance lover, but the mixture of plot and narrative elements in this book compelled me.I loved how the magic of Sun-running felt so perfect in a desert environment, and how characters afraid of love fell in love. The dragons and princes gave it magnificence, and I'll remember this book forever.Perhaps I should end the review now, but I can't. This was my first romance novel, and some parts of your first will always stay with you. During later re-reads I found the population of the world unrealistically low, and the beginning a bit clunky. If I had never read this before and read it now, it would be less stars.I loved this book, but if you are an experienced reader, it will be merely OK. I believe that it would make the perfect gift for a teenage girl who hasn't read many novels."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"I picked up this series because it was given good reviews by Anne McCaffrey, an author I have a good deal of respect for. After reading this work I wouldn't take her suggustions anytime in the near future. The book was dry from begining to end and has a way of sluggng you in the face with information rather than sharing it. The storyline I thought was well thought out but if the book had convey it in a different way that made it less informative and more entertaining than I would have enjoyed it."
4,Great book!,"This is one of the best books I eva read. I would give it 5 stars but then Camigwen, my fav character died. But it's still great! Great action, great humor and a great serie!"
5,EPIC FANTASY,"RAWN IS A GREAT WORLD BUILDER. DRAGON PRINCE IS PROBABLYTHE BEST FIRST NOVEL OF A FANTASY SAGA, I'VE EVER READ.RAWN THRUST YOU INTO A MEDIEVAL DESERT WORLD FILLED WITHWARRING PRINCES, DEADLY INTRIGUES, MAGIC, DRAGONS ANDROMANCE. YOU WILL ALMOST FEEL LIKE YOU ARE THERE BATTLINGWITH PRINCE ROHAN AGAINST THE EVIL HIGH PRINCE."
4,"Fantasy, Romance, and yes, Dragons","Despite what some readers from PA believe, this is a fine fantasy novel with a believable, consistent, magical basis that honors traditional fantasy works without simply falling for old fashioned cliches. (The connection between Dragons and their traditional hordes of gold is priceless in and of itself.)Yes, there are a bunch of attractive people in the book (heroes and villains alike are too good-looking to be true), but more important than their ""perfect"" looks is the fact they act and react like real people--honest, dishonest, loving, jealous, angry, and fallible--they aren't the perfect cardboard cut-out characters that litter so many fantasy novels. They grow; they change; they make mistakes (some BIG ones); and, they go on with their lives. Admittedly, this is the weakest of Rawn's Dragon Books. Her Dragon Star trilogy clearly shows how she was growing as a writer, but the Dragon Prince and the rest of his trilogy was not a bad way for her to start."
2,Boring and overly simple,"This makes the third book in a week I started and could not finish. Now, I hate not finishing books, and this recent spell is not a commont on me, but on my choice of reading material.Basically, this is boring and repative and nothing is left for the reader to learn on their own. The author writes as if for a six year old child who needs everything, even the stated emotions of the characters, explained to them. And the characters have no personality among them and act weirdly in ways I can only assume the author thinks reader should see as leadership or something like that. Even though everyone doubts him, the second the main character becomes a prince every action he takes is perfect and wise! All women are desirable and perfectly suited to their husbands! You can see where I'm going. This book just is not worth reading to me.I give up. Two stars."
1,thoroughly terrible,"i don't want to waste too many words in reviewing this book. reading it already took too much of my time as it is, hours i will never get back. how any ""author"" could write this and publish it instead of keeping it on a comp a home for her own sick pleasure and hope to get away with it is beyond me. it did not contain an insightful view of humanity--just a very delusional, bitter one, perhaps due to childhood traumas. not worth Whelan's effort."
2,Be careful!,"I am a very strong and fast reader, but I couldn't sit through the whole book. I had to skip a few chapters. Here's my summary: It's a romance novel with some dragons and gore. If you like hot sweaty romance then this is a good book for you. I personally didn't care for it AT ALL. There are many VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY inappropriate parts for a kid under the age of 14. My advice: Read it yourself or take my word for it before you buy it for a young teen or preteen. It is around 600 pages so you better be a good reader. I hope this helps you."
5,All I can say is WOW!,When I first picked up this book I had just finished as series that I had absolutely fallen in love with. I never thought that any books would be able to compare to the ones I had just finished reading...I was wrong. Melanie Rawn's books inspired me to tears. Even just reading the reviews has sparked intense emotions. I loved Rohan and Sioned. How could you not? Sioned is the type of women that every girl wants to grow up to be like. But the thing that stood out most for me was the magic and the dragons. After reading these books I can't help but want to be a Sunrunner and a Sorceror. :^) OH yes..and I would LOVE more books...I agree with one reviewer...what is in store for Meig?
3,These are squirty toys.,"I think these crabs were cute, but I did not realize they were squirty toys. I do not like squirty toys for the tub, so I returned them."
1,NOT mold resistant,"I specifically got these because they are described as being mold resistant. After we received them and started playing with them, I noticed that each one has a small squirt hole in it. Squirt toys are not mold resistant. When toys allow water in, but cannot totally dry out, it is the perfect breeding ground for mold. And why would I want my children bathing with mold? Total false advertising. Completely disappointing and a waste of money."
2,more trouble than they're worth,"They do not stay together if you move the chain of them the least little bit. This really frustrates my child and annoys me!It is not easy to get them linked together in the first place.Our ""n"" is upside down from the rest of them. When the we put the alphabet in order, the lowercase ""n"" looks like a ""u"" and confuses my son. Not good for learning to recognize his letters!!!"
5,Recommend,"My 22 month old daughter enjoys this toy in so many different ways, as you might imagine. I strongly recommend it."
4,Dil To Pagal Hai,"This was a really good Bollywood movie, and the soundtrack is good too. I love the song Le Gayi, but the whole soundtrack is a little more ""dance"" music that I remembered from the movie. All the same, the tunes are fun, and they are great to listen to as well as put it on in the background at a party or something. If you liked the movie, I definitely recommend this soundtrack. I personally didn't really like the music until I saw the movie, and then I decided to download the soundtrack. The quality is good, and as is normally the case, Bollywood soundtracks are just fun."
5,Always good...,"With fragrances, it's always up to your taste, what smell you like. I like Perry Ellis, and have used it for a number of years. It's not overpowering, just right. Try it out. There are some other sites which offer it, too, and for somewhat less money..."
3,Not as effluent as wished,"Very Neutral on odor. Doesn't last long, but for the price is clean spirited. Very nice container? Not really musty more sweet!"
3,"Works great, but cheap construction","I was torn on giving this rating because so far these do work and work well. However, for this price they could easily have a more durable metal housing and hotshoe foot instead of cheap plastic. They're very reliable in functionality, just hope they stay that way over time before breaking. 5 stars for performance, 1 star for build = 3 stars overall."
5,Must Have!!!,This Item Is A Must Have In Your Kit!! It does just what it supposed to do and does it very well I Recomend it xpecially if youre into off camera flash photography.
5,pocketwizard,The PocketWizard works as expected from all the positive reviews I've read about it. I already had a wireless system for my flashes but wanted to be able to use one less piece of equipment. That's why I changed to pocketwizard and the sekonic meter. Now I don't need to have an extra transmitter to take flash readings at my subject.
2,Broken,These things are great when they work. But mine was sent broken! And I have had so many break over the years. Customer service isn't all that great either. Good thing it cost $350 for a piece of plastic that doesn't work half the time
3,Great operation limited by poor quality and high cost,"I've used a pair of PocketWizard units with a Canon 40D body & Canon Speedlite 580EX II setup. I love the simple but capable function of these units, from connection options to their many uses/functions!I absolutely despise the build quality!!! For over $150 each, these should be built like tanks. The plastic feels and looks rather cheap, but worst of all, the 'locking nut' does not turn easily and it is somewhat difficult to know when the unit is secure.None of this is a show-stopper - the unit works great as advertised. The trouble is the price/quality ratio. If these were at or below about $50, I'd say they're worth it. At over $150, they're a ripoff. After designing products like this for a living, I've learned that they've likely got less than $15 in parts for these units.I may have to go in to business underselling these guys with a superior product. Any takers? :)"
5,"Cool, but study how to use it before you buy it","I'm a professional photographer who is just starting out. I wish this product explained to me in the online description that you need two of them to make it work.I also didn't know anything about flash sync so the first wedding I used it for bombed.All of that to say.... now that I know how to use it I'm stoked! Its a really cool ""toy"" and I'm sure it'll help me produce some rockin' images."
4,Cheap built quality,"I bought four of these units, after struggling with the calumet radio triggers (I need the additional range provide by the PWs). I would have given PW a five star rating except for the fact of the built quality. The hot shoe mount is very poorly design and the quality and feel of the material is like what another reviewer mentioned (like a cheap 10 dollar toy). I wish the thumbscrew wheel had a larger diameter and I struggle to really get a ""secure mount to the camera hot shoe without breaking the unit. I have a buddy who is also a professional photographer and he has already broken the flimsy mount on one of his PW. I wish they would address this problem because there is no doubt they are making a killing, charging 200 bucks for a radio, when you can go out and buy a Sony AM/FM radio for 15 bucks. In their defense, never had problem firing the trigger. I am an architectural photographer and I typically fire the units 900 -1000 times a week."
5,Expensive but it works.,These triggers are extremely expensive but they are in industry standard. If you talk to any professional photographer they use Pocketwizards. If you want to be taken seriously then you must own at least a few. Amazingly enough even on Ebay used Pocketwizards go for abou 90% of the retail price. To me its just better to pay full retail and get the 3 year warranty. An ideal setup is pocketwizards and then use a Sekonic Light Meter with built in Pocketwizard transmitter. It allows you to fire the strobes up to 100feet from the meter. This keeps you from tripping on codes and most sync cables are 10ft. Pocketwizards are made in the USA which is great in these difficult economic times.
2,A may be for Canon...,"The Good: Easy configuration, Decent range, Works like a charm (as a trigger) with outlet powered strobes.The Bad: Cheap construction ($20 dollar radio toy sets @ Wal-Mart have better construction), shorter battery life (for max range and reliability), reliability is very low with Canon speed lights (in my case 580 Ex II), No TTL handling (just a trigger), will have to spend another couple hundred bucks on a light meter for accurate exposures, does not come with any carrying case/pouch (a must for such a cheap constructed expansive piece of a device). Will have to buy the right cables/adopters to make the right connection (only comes with one tiny PC connection cord)."
1,check out the Cybersyncs people!,"The question is WHY? Why would u buy these units?? Just for starters....has anybody seen the size of these things!?? they're HUGE! put them on your hotshoe and retarded huge is a more accurate description LOL...I'm a helo pilot, not an Alien Bees rep. I just think every strobist should check the Cybersyncs. I've owned them for about a year already and performance is flawless...with NO misfires...for a fraction of the price of a PW. It's a no brainer really. They're tiny, cheap, and 100% functional. Why waste your hard earned money on these PW units?? If u shoot wirelessly, don't have money to waste, and prefer good quality products....check out the Cybersyncs."
3,Pocket Wizzard,"What Amazon isn't telling you here you need 2 of these units to make it work. One for the camera and one to go at the light head. SO.....now your price is $169.00 x 2 which is 338 plus tax and shipping.....A little eye opener from $169.00. The unit that Calumet Camera sells, Light Lynx, both units and cord for under $250. Yes I know Alien Bees is $160 for the whole magilla, but when you need stuff in a heart beat I'd rather buy locally, support the local economy, and have the local support should something go wrong. Alien Bees is in Tennessee, Amazon isn't your tech support hot spot for these units and Pocket Wizard doesn't have retail outlets. So is it worth the extra $40 to buy locally and have the support or buy from a box house and take you chances."
2,Will this work with my 420Ex Speedlite ??,"I have just purchased this unit anr am praying that this will work with my flash,,,( 420Ex speedlite) it has a option switch on it... hoping someone reviews this. Any info wouldbe great..."
5,Reliable!,"Previously I owned a Calumet brand transceiver. That brand failed over time by not firing when releasing the shutter, and being finnicky about which light it was mounted to. Then the back silver part where you plug in the cord became loose and fell out. I bought this PocketWizard set and WHAT A DIFFERENCE. Fires every time. Period. Good construction, longer antennae, far less worries about the angle of the camera vs. where the transceiver is fixed on the light. Excellent buy. I will never buy another brand again."
5,Pocket Wizard Plus II,Amazing. I forgot to purchase the flash sync cord when I bought this though. That was inconvenient when I had to run out the day of my shoot and go buy one. But I love this product! I had a cheap Alien Bee's transmitter and receiver and had to go out and get the Pocket Wizards because they are just the best!
5,Great. Works as advertised.,"With the rebates, it was a great deal. I don't think I would have gotten them if it weren't for the rebates though. The newer ControlTL versions of the pocketwizards look even more amazing with the utilization of wireless TTL. But these are great for what it is."
3,"Practical, not compact.","I have been using bare minerals for a while now and I finally bought this case. I must say that it doesn't spill at all and the brush is very cute and mini, but the case is huge! Is like a brick.It wouldn't of killed them to make it more stylish or less black and weapon like.If you want this case for your home or travel I would highly recommend it, but if you're thinking of taking it to a party or to dinner, you will probably not have enough room in your purse."
3,Nice but bulky...,"I love the Bare Minerels and wanted a case to carry my Mineral Veil everywhere... I think the case is a little bit too bulky and the brush too small for all over face use, so i still use my Kabuki brush, the case is empty and you must filled with your favourite Bare Mineral product..."
2,only got half of product ordered.,I love the kabuki brush but did not get the flawless face case (which is why I bought it!). The item(s) are now discontinued...?
4,Nice book,"This book has no cusing, and the fight scenes are not all that violent either. It's a book for kids and adults. The names of the chacters are hard to pronouce, but the chacters are cool. I love the cover, and there are a few spelling errors. It's fun to read, it's like fantasy, fighting, and revenge. The beside spelling errors, and no magical animals, such as dragons, the book was pretty good.Leigh H.M."
3,Spelling errors.,"It was a good book, but alas, I couldn't help but notice the spelling errors. The last part in the book would've been better if the last sentence did not have a spelling error. ""Oh Takiro, I 'though' you'd never ask."" should've been ""thought"". And in the tournament scene, instead of saying ""You are going to 'loose'..."" it should say ""lose"". A simple mistake, I guess. I'm not trying to be mean, I just think you should've had an editor in hand, or at least a better one at most...Don't ""loose"" hope just try harder or get an editor, you could've even asked an intelligent friend or teacher.*Ciao~~ Monica ""S.N."" Perez*"
1,A Waste of Six Bucks.,"Plot implausible. Whiney main character spends most of the book telling the love interest to ""get out of here, I'm working."" Why would anyone be interested in this cranky woman? I give Iris one star for what could be an interesting character, a forensic sculptor, but I'll never know because I don't plan to read another."
3,Good but could be better.,"This book was a pleasant diversion. It was easy to follow, the plot was good, if a bit contrived, and the characters were well drawn for the most part. I only wish Ms. Johansen had developed more of the aspects of Eve Duncan's profession, forensic sculptor. I found this premise very intriguing, but it really wasn't given all that much attention in the book. It needed more detail. Of course, this story required a suspension of belief, but isn't that what a good suspense novel should do? I will read the sequel, ""The Killing Game,"" hoping that the forensic anthropology subject is given more detail in the story. All in all, good but could be better, but not bad in any case!"
4,"Exciting, unpredictable, surprising, and keeps you guessing.","Having read a few of Ms Johansen's novels I found The Face ofDeception fabulous. Ms. Johansen gives you a nice mix of charactersthat adds a nice flavor to a very suspenseful novel. Our heroine is strong, decisive, and capable you get this message upfront and she won't disappoint you. Loved this page turner and look forward to the sequel, great read."
5,Fascinating page turner. 5 Stars!,"""The Face of Deception"" was great. I didn't think anything could top the impact ""The Triumph and the Glory"" had on me, but this novel did. It is brilliant, an intriguing study in character development in a mystery. Very, very well done!"
2,Disappointing,"Not a very interesting plot or characters. A slow reader, slow paced book. Took a while to get interesting and when it does, it's only momentary. Would not recommend this one unless you have a long weekend with nothing else to do."
4,Lethal Weapon,"Fast-paced with good dialogue, it moves you right along from one narrow escape to another. You don't have a chance to get bored, but you never get attached to the characters. My first Johansen, not my last."
1,earth to iris!,"Sorry, but I laughed aloud at the plot at parts. This book on its own would have relegated Iris to my ""Authors I've Given Up On"" list, but the day an author cheats me into buying a sequal to find the answers to unresolved issues is the day I stop reading that author."
2,Okay...,"I have read many of Iris Johansen's books. So far, this is the one I liked the least. The main character, Eve Duncan, is the most annoying ""heroine"" I have ever come across. She is so obsessed with the daughter she lost that she can't get on with her life. Yes, bad things happen, but eventually you get over it. Well, Eve doesn't. I was so disappointed with this book that I will definitely not read the rest of the series because I honestly don't care what happens. On the upside, the other characters and the plot were good. If Eve had been different, this book could have been great, but as is... it just isn't worth it. Iris Johansen is usually a great author and I would highly recommend her book The Ugly Duckling instead of this one."
2,How did this book get published?,"This is the first Johansen book I've read, but it will be the last. There are just too many good authors and good novels out there to waste your time with this trite and boring book. Don't waste your time or your money."
2,"Tight, Detailed, but not much thrill!","I liked the story, but it wasn't exactly a nail biter. I enjoyed the way the story weaved the characters together and each one had good depth. However, the main character seemed too super human. Over all, it was an interesting tail, but it won't keep you awake at night thinking about it."
2,Half-Baked,"I have read every book that IJ has written and was eagerly awaiting this new book. IJ's first romantic suspense was great, her second average but this new book looks like it had potential. This book brings us the character of Eve Duncan, forensic sculptor. I got involved with her character and IJ spent many pages developing Eve. But the suspense storyline got rather far fetch and the way the suspense ended was very abrupt & uninspired. But the worst part about this ""romantic suspense"" is that there is no romance and I found the characters of the two male leads to be very superficial. At the end of the book, I felt cheated out of half the book. It seemed to me that she was saving the second half of this book to sell as a sequel. Boo Hoo!"
3,Paradoxical .....had to finish but always a bit dissatisfied,In this day and age hardly any premise is totally incomprehensible so I went with Ms Johansen on this point. What I couldn't get by was the total lack of understanding by her main character. The reader was to feel empathy for a character who had none to offer unless it was on the brink of or after brutal death.... NOT a very likeable woman. I will read the sequel but I think it rather a cheap ploy to leave so much unanswered in the first book. Ms. Johansen should read Tami Hoag for lessons in how to write a mystery series.
2,I did not like it much...,.. Well I really did not like it period.! It was boring and unrealistic even for fiction and plain out stupid. There were a lot of unanswered questions AND where is the romance? not even one lousy kiss!
3,I was NEVER so disappointed in my life!,"I waited for my newly released Face of Deception, to be sent to me. I couldn't wait to get home when I had found out it had arrived. My anticipation grew when I knew that I would the weekend to read. From reading her pass works, I knew that I was in for a treat. When I got to around page 200, and Ms. Johansen had yet to develop the main character fully, I knew that there would be no true ending of this book. I feel the plot was very well written, and overall it was above average. I just feel that I should have waited until the paperback came out, when I would not be waiting at least a year for the conclusion of this book, in my view, that the author should have spent 250 more pages to completing."
3,Not a Romance,"A well written book with only two problems. There is no romance at all in this book (nor sex for that matter), and the murder mystery is a little shallow. Character wise, you have an insane woman who just might trade herself, her mother and her best friend's lives in exchange for the chance of recovering the bones of her murdered daughter. The two male characters are an over controlling rich man that seems incredibly incompetent and a married cop who seems to have an obsession for the crazy woman. Still the author is such a good writer she can even carry a poorly conceived story with bad characterization. The sequel (The Killing Game) is much better. If you haven't read this author, don't judge her by this book."
4,happily ever after?,"I have read all of Iris Johanson's books and enjoy the romance, suspense and interaction between the characters. The fact that her characters are unique individuals, each bringing something of their life into her stories, makes the storyline more complicated and interesting. This book was somewhat disappointing. Always, before, her books had a happy ending; this time there was no ending. For the readers who look toward romance to make their lives a little more interesting, this lack of an ""forever after"" made us very unhappy."
1,"A ""Wall thumper""","I became so irritated, this paperback became a ""wall-thumper"" as it hit the living room wall. I love some of her books (earlier ones usually) but her more recent suspense books are extremely hit or miss. And this one missed. Not suspenseful. Eve is annoying. Logan is annoying. Joe is annoying. Plot was ridiculous. Almost embarasssed that I actually skimmed through to the unsatisfying ending. Iris--you can do better!"
1,Annoying,"The character of Eve was just annoying, because it was always the same, no developement at all.The story was interesting but the flow of the story was unbelievable."
2,I'm kinda iffy on this one ...,"I'm no mystery/thriller guru, and this was my first Iris Johansen book. Although the back cover sounds really interesting, the story seriously lacks believability ... I tried explaining the (convoluted) plot to coworkers and had them looking at me like I had 2 heads ... it's OK for airplane reading, but I would not recommend this to a connoisseur ..."
2,Disapointing,"I absolutely loved Ms. Johansen's first two books in this genre, so I was really looking forward to this one. But what a disapointment. The characters were completely unsympathetic and uninteresting as was the plot. Sorry Iris, I'm skipping the next one."
2,This was a very disappointing book!,"Even with a premise this silly, a better writer might have made the story work. Unfortunately for the reader, the weakest character by far is the protagonist, Eve Duncan. She's totally one dimensional. It's hard to understand why either Joe Quinn or John Logan is interested in her. And, if you take out all the expletives (mostly Eve's), you'd have a book about half its current length and save a lot of trees in the process."
4,A New Series,"After losing her daughter to a serial killer, forensic sculptor Eve Duncan survives by throwing herself into her work. The best in her field at rebuilding faces from bare skull bones, Eve specializes in identifying missing children. Billionaire John Logan requests her help in identifying an adult skull. Eve tells Logan that she isn't interested but when he volunteers to donate a large sum of money to a charity for missing children in exchange for her time, Eve reluctantly agrees. Logan neglects to tell her that there are powerful people who are determined to keep the skull's true identity a secret at any cost. Soon Eve's life is in danger and she isn't very happy about it. She calls Logan dirty names almost from their first meeting until the end of the book. I may not have been in the mood for this type book and that's why it didn't get five stars."
1,Not to my liking...........,"This book is listed as a romantic supspense, and I suppose I found some suspense but where was the romance? Frankly I don't know who would be that interested in Eve romantically anyway. I finally lost interest three quarters through the book and just skipped to the ending. Even with a plot this far-fetched, if it had been interesting and well written I would have finished the book. This book fell far short of the ablities that Ms. Johansen has shown in the ""Wind Dacner"" series.Ree-views"
2,A Terrific Premise Is Not Enough!,"I thought the idea of a female forensic sculptor who could identify decedents by sculpting their faces back onto their bare bones skulls was terrific. That she got into this line of work due to her own daughter's supposed death and unrecovered body due to a serial killer only added to the idea. However, once into the book, I found myself into a rather standard chase thriller with the good guys trying to remain ahead of the bad guys, all of the characters being such a cliche as to never raise my interest level. This author was much better when she was writing about relationships and emotions way back when in the romance genre instead of the thriller genre. The cover really really fooled me on this one. It is a knockout job of a sculpted head in strips by Alan Ayers/Bantam and it totally pulled me into the forensic premise of this novel. Too bad the novel didn't deliver on its cover promise!"
1,Convoluted & boring & with an unlikeable main character.,"I have basically given up on this book. The main character, Eve, is annoying, pompous, sanctimonious and rude. It is absolutely impossible to like her or sympathize with her. I assume the author's intent was to make Eve tough and independent-minded, but it does not work. In fact, none of the characters are very likeable. The text is very heavy-handed and any real suspense is lost. This is not a good book!"
1,DISAPPOINTING!!!,"I have been a IJ fan for years and her books have always been keepers. UGLY DUCKLING was good... but since then it has been downhill. I was so angry by the time I finished THE FACE OF DECEPTION! IJ has forgotten the fans who have made her famous. The characters just made me mad-where was the romance? You have to care about what happens to Eve, Logan and Joe and I didn't."
1,Boring!,"I was really anxious to get this book home and start reading. The story outline on the back cover made the book seem very interesting.But I could never get into it. And night after night I tried.The main character lacked a solid personality it was hard to get to know her in fact all the character's where kind of incomplete. This story was missing alot.And I was really looking forward to Iris Johansen because she has so many books on the market.I'm just not sure I will give anymore a try, at least not at full price!"
5,The Face of Deception,"Amazon is the best. I am now residing overseas and have found that I can actually reach out and touch home through my orders. Being so far from home, this is very important to find that there are companies that care about our men and women overseas. Keep up the good work."
3,Okay....,"This was good book for the most part, but not something that really caught my attention. About half way through, the suspense was gone and you were told what happened and why. The main character, Eve Duncan, was not someone that I even cared what happened to. She was so pessimistic about everything and everyone. This is an okay book but there are better ones out there."
4,A great novel of mystery and suspense!,"The Face of Deception, by Iris Johansen, is a suspenseful novel telling the story of forensic sculptor Eve Duncan who gets tossed into a no-win situation where she must face death, blackmail, and her toughest decision by far. Fast to speak her mind, one would not imagine Eve to fall victim to bribery; but when a man named John Logan enters the picture, and desperately offers her anything to reconstruct a skull for him, she takes the job without realizing the horror that would befall her.I would recommend borrowing this novel rather than buying it strictly because you learn information towards the end that will ruin the suspense at the beginning, making it less exciting to read the second time. All readers seeking mystery and suspense should give this book a try as well as those interested in forensic sciences."
2,Eve Duncan irritated me.,"This was my first book by Iris Johansen. I enjoyed the book, as I usually do when I choose a book. The plot, with it's many twists, was a little hard to foresee, but I kept in mind that it was ""non-fiction."" There is no doubt we are clueless as to what really goes on behind the scenes in Washington, and this does offer a new idea, or at least to. I did enjoy the story line. Insofar as the characters go, the thought of Fiske was conceivable, as was Margaret, Sandra, etc... even Logan. My biggest problem was in regards to Eve. The more I read the more I began to doubt her character. She became irritating and unbelievable. For such a strong and educated person, her judgements and reasonings were pathetic and weak. If Ms Johansen issues a sequel. I will not read it nor recommend it. However after reading the other comments, I will purchase another Johansen novel and see......"
1,Very disappointing,"I have been a big fan of Iris Johansen's romantic suspense novels ever since I read 'And Then You Die'. I anxiously awaited the release of her newest story and found that I couldn't even finish it. The character Eve was annoying and rude and I found the other characters poorly developed. I recommend to any new readers to her work unhappy with this novel and want more romance and suspense, try some of her earlier novels such as Long After Midnight."
2,A huge disappointment.,"Iris Johansen has jumped into the arena of ludicrous conspiracy theories with a novel that constitutes neither a thriller or romantic suspense. It's just plain nutty, going beyond the realm of credibility into something that had me exclaiming out loud in disbelief. Common sense tells one that nothing in her plot could ever happen in real life. I know it's fiction, but unless it's science fiction, I like a little dose of reality in a plot. I sure didn't get any in this book. I used to be a big fan of Ms. Johansen, but her last three books have really strained my fondness for her writing. Suffice it to say I'll be spending my money elsewhere from now on."
2,I was VERY Disappointed!!,"I have read all of Ms. Johansen's books and was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this one! As I started reading it I was intrigued but shortly became confused. I felt I was missing a large part of the story, like I came in at the middle. The character of Eve Duncan was not developed to its fullest and left many unanswered questions (i.e., her relationship with Joe Quinn). As a suspense novel it kept my attention for awhile, however, it was very easy to put down! As a romance novel, I am still waiting! The author's note stated that there will be another Eve Duncan book. Hopefully this one will fill in all the blanks. However, I'll borrow that copy instead of buying it or better yet it should be given out a an ""Oops, we forgot to include these chapters!"""
5,great book,"This is the first book that I read on my new Kindle. I loved the plot and plan on reading more book from the same author,"
2,Merely Average,After hearing all the buzz about Iris Johansen I wonder what the fuss is about. None of the characters are particularly compelling. I never felt a real connection between Eve and Logan or Joe. Disappointing. I won't pick up the 2nd installment of the Eve Duncan series.
2,The book suffers from plonking predictablility.,"""No,"" she said.Logan narrowed his gaze at her.Eve stiffened.Margaret left the room to take care of something.Joe stood protectively over Eve while managing to dangerously intimidate Logan.""Yes, you will,"" Logan said.Eve stiffened.That about sums it up, folks."
5,Outstanding Book,A very hard book to put down. Interesting characters and great plot. I enjoy books that are full of humor and unexpected turns such as this one.
4,Wonderful read,This is a book that every parent should read. It's one of those books you don't want to put it down til the last page is read.
2,Not so Great,"The storyline was interesting and likeable. However, Eve Duncan was not. She was self-centered, whiny, and annoying. Throughout the entire book I kept saying how much I disliked her. There wasn't much depth to the other characters either which made it hard to connect with them as well. It's a decent book, but would not recommend to someone who wants to feel what the characters feel and experience what they do."
4,"Entertaining, with some good twists","If you're tired of the overwritten, holier than thou Kay Scarpetta, you can find a new hero in Eve Duncan. She is tough, smart, yet vulnerable. This story uses many current themes (dominant first ladies, conspiracy theory, billionaires dabbling in politics) which I found amusing. The author surprises us, though, with some plot twists that had me guessing. Pick it up if you're looking for reading entertainment. I recommend it to Grafton fans."
1,Deceptive title - makes you think it's interesting,"This was my first and last book by Iris Johansen. To compare her to Patricia Cornwell (as one reviewer did) is an insult to Patricia Cornwell. I felt like the chapters should have been titled by their intention, the lack of craft was so obvious. ""In this chapter I'll use other characters to describe the main character."" Ever heard of show don't tell? The dialog was completely unbelievable. Don't be lured in. Take your $6.95 and buy a snack that won't leave you with the same bitter aftertaste this book will."
2,very disappointing and not up to Ms. Johansen's talent,"I have read all of Iris Johansen's books and looked forward to a new one. It was very disappointing. There was very little suspense, poorly defined characters and no romance. I won't buy another of her hardbacks."
2,To Bland,"I will not buy another Iris Johanson hardcover. I will just read her paperbacks . She gets worse. Her characters have lost their excitment, and I do not consider this a Romantic Suspence. I always bought everything she wrote but not anymore."
2,Main character is too negative and one dimensional,"Although Iris Johanson is a good writer with an interesting storyline, she fails to make the main character very likeable. Eve Duncan is sarcastic, bitter and quite negative. I would have enjoyed the book more if Eve had shown a kind side to her personality. She is very one dimensional and this makes the story less interesting."
4,A Picture Book,"This book is made from excerpts of the Central of Georgia RR magazine (various names) published for the employees. It is primarily a ""picture book' but I found it very interesting and since it concentrates mostly on the period from 1940 through 1960 I found it especially interesting because this is the period I lived in Atlanta. For me it rekindled memories especially of the Nancy Hanks & the Man of War passenger trains. If your looking for a technical RR book look elsewhere but if you want to see photos of the people who make the trains go and the trains themselves in glorious black & white then this book will satisfy."
2,A disappointment,"There may be good Christmas books out there, but this isn't one of them. I bought it for my grandson to go with the Little People manger set. It doesn't really tell the Christmas story, however. Concentration on the star and not the baby Jesus. The text isn't suitable for a young child either--too many big words."
2,Don't believe the Hype!!,"I've been taking Tight for about 6 months. I haven't seen any noticable difference caused by this product. I'm taking it along with eating healthy, regular vitamins, and working out. There was never any quick loss of weight or sudden energy boost. I can't recommend it because I haven't felt the results other than occasionally feeling light headed or a headache that the other reviews raved about. Hope it helps you in making your decision."
4,Its OK,"It's a big book. I found it to be filled with useful information. This book also goes into great detail. I think every Java programmer should have this book on their desk, if they can fit it there.Staten Island Java Grouphttp://www.statenislandonline.com/jav"
1,He should practice what he preaches!,In terms of his own instructions...he should have been able to engage me and keep me motivated to continue reading his VERY boring book...! I gained nothing thatI did not already know
5,Best book on NLP I have read,"I am about half way through this book. I have had a fair amount of training and have done a lot of research on NLP and this is by far the best book I have got my hands on. The book jumps right in and actualy utilizes NLP techniques to reach the reading audience. I am a professional life coach and this type of reading is typically dull research. I found I could put this book down and i started watching everyone around me and practicing on my wife and children. This is a must for anyone who wants more out of their career, relationships, life in general."
3,Very good score,"Good score, beautiful ending. Perhaps JNH might have been able to do better with more time, but this is overall a strong work. Not his best."
3,Dissapointing,"When I think of recent great soundtracks (or scores) I think of Lord of the Rings, Glory, Braveheart, Titanic, and many others. What to me makes a great score is that I can pop it in my CD player at work and it stands alone as a good piece of music. I also prefer scores that stay the same thematically throughout the entire 60+ minutes of the CD.This is not the case with King Kong. I received the Kong score before seeing the film and was dissapointed by it. There are no real soaring pieces, and the CD as a whole lacked continuity. Instead, there are many disparate pieces that prevent the listener to really enjoying or getting into it. After seeing the movie, the score works just fine in the film, just not as a stand-alone piece of music."
2,To be honest...,"Not the best score I've ever heard. Certainly not bad, some tracks were very nice. Unfortunately, a good deal of them are too action-oriented for my liking, or simply boring. The best piece of music from the film, the beautifully haunting female chorus played over the spider pit scene (best part of the movie!), is sadly nowhere to be found on this disc. I don't doubt Howard's talent as a composer, but the music for King Kong, sadly, doesn't have the same bite as the movie."
3,BOOOOORRRING!,One can only hope that the movie is more exciting than this score. Even John Barry's 70 score was better....at least it had that jungle quality of the sacrifice of the girl to Kong which is such a great scene...but on this score...nothing.
4,Another effective score by James Newton Howard.,"Since watching ""King Kong"" in the theater (and spotting composer Howard Shore in one of the later scenes), I've learned that Shore's score for the movie was discarded and James Newton Howard was brought in at the last minute. Howard's score is very effective, lending just the right touches, but nothing really stands out. I was sorry to learn that one of my favorite cues in the movie isn't on the soundtrack CD, but that is such a common thing nowadays. Overall, it's another effective score from Mr. Howard."
3,Beautiful and Incomplete . . .,"I love this score, and after the film came out I listened to it a lot. I like the tender moments the score emphasized especially towards the end,and the haunting choir used in so many cues. And that's where I am at odds: there is a lot of music missing from this single disc release. Where's the rest of it? This easily could have been a double CD; hopefully we'll get that in the near future, but there are just too many missing cues to give this release five-stars."
5,King Kong,"King Kong is probably one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. James Newton Howard does a awesome job with invoking emotions. Several tracks are very sad, and match the movie perfectly. This is very good music. Well done, James Newton Howard!"
5,Tragic Hero,James Newton Howard's hauntingly beautiful soundtrack changes the whole personna of King Kong. The music takes over when Kong is with beauty and we don't envision him as the beast. We can only see a mighty monster tuned into an innocent fuzzy pet mezmerized by his tragic love for this tiny fragile human. The soundtrack is so powerful the images I keep in my mind of King Kong will always be associated with the soundtrack of James Newton Howard.
3,far from enough,I bought this cd on the strength of a review in the Boston Globe . I know most of the artist on this cd and have listen to it several times having a hard time getting comfortable with it. It seems disjointed to me . The only song I can honestly say I enjoy is Big Log the Robert Plant song . Maybe three stars is low but I'm really noe impressed with this cd.
4,old fashioned English story,"I have had this book since a girl, its a story about 3 children whose father is lost at sea, mother needs an income so buys a boarding house by the sea during winter. Bored children walk along the beach and find a shell, when they put it to their ears they can hear a grumpy mermaid asking for their wishes. Wishes and adventures follow, with the very last wish bringing the family back together. Its only 95 pages long."
5,A Bridge Across Forever,"Rebecca Chan Allen has written a masterful book that bridgesancient eastern wisdom and modern western organization problems.The book illuminates both the practical and theoretical side of some of our greatest organizational issues, and supports leadersin playing full rich transformational roles in organization change."
1,"Totally unnecessary, thoroughly disposable","I was quite displeased with this book. Please, save your money, it's not worth it at all. All it does is to quote from all 14 Fleming's amazing novels, so you would be much better off reading the original novels than reading this book.This book, by no means, will add to knowledge regarding Bond universe, so, if you want to know more about James Bond, if you are really interested in getting deeper into it, and know more about both the literary and the screen hero, buy JAMES BOND - THE LEGACY, written by Bruce Scivalli, the same one who's responsible in putting the extras on the DVDs together. Legacy is supperbly written, a true jewel, it encompass every aspect of the 20 pictures and more, much more.I gave one star just because I wasn't able to give zero."
1,Wrong item or false advertising. Not sure.,"Got the part today and its the right sprocket but not the ""Ultralight"" version shown as the product picture. It doesn't have the six large holes in it. I seriously don't feel like having the hassle of sending it back so I'm just settling for the heavy one. Not cool guys."
4,wall mount protrusion,"great sturdy mount, one con is that the mount is generous in the amount of space the monitor protrudes from wall - about 2-1/2"" brackets seem redundant"
3,George Baker Selection,While the music is good Paloma Blanca is by far the best followed by Little Green Bag. The rest are only a listen to now and then .
1,Tanita 1583 Digital scales,"WOULD LIKE TO GIVE A REVIEW BUT AS OF TODAY 13/6/2011 GOODS HAVE STILL NOT ARRIVED EVEN THOUGH THEY WHERE PROMISED BY KNOWI purchased this item on May 11, 2011"
3,Great for military gurus. Difficult for Grad Students,"I read this text for 2 graduate classes in International Affairs. This book would be highly useful for military analysts, but less tangible for those without military background. Interesting information, but a challenging read for this Graduate Student!"
2,Disappointing!,"I received this Canvas piece for our new baby's room, and it looks like the baby did the painting! I think someone litterally drew it out with felt marker, then colored it in with watercolors. It doesn't look like an oil painting, and doesn't look nice at all. If I could figure a way to return it, I would, but it came while I was out of town, and hubby threw away the box/slip.I felt this was a way overpriced piece for the quality. Too bad, although I love the REST of the Sir Leapsalot set that I have received."
3,WAIT UNTIL IT GETS MARKED DOWN!,"I bought the Sir Leapsalot wall art and I was quite disappointed in the quality! Babies R Us had 6 in stock, and I chose the best one. However, they all had color variations and flaws in every single one. I went to another Babies R Us and again it was the same thing.It is very cute though and did match the nursery perfect so I am going to have my sister repaint the crown part so that the imperfections are not so obvious. The actual frogs look like my 9 year old drew them also!"
3,"LOVE THE FROGS,DISLIKE THE QUALITY",I AGREE WITH THE LAST REVIEW. IT DOES LOOK CHEAP IN PERSON AND BETTER ON THE WEBSITE.I HAVE DONE MY NURSERY IN THAT PARTICULAR PATTERN SO I KEPT IT...BUT IT WAS NOT WORTH THE MONEY.
5,"Terrific sprayer, great adhesive","I purchased this product after calling 3M to ask what the best product would be to glue the vinyl sides onto the doors of my car. This definitely did the trick. Spraying the glue onto foam made it easy to do as I didn't have to spread the glue and disrupt the dried foam. The spray of glue comes out fan shaped, so it doesn't spray all over and is easy to direct where you want it. It gets tacky enough to stick, but leaves you enough time to work with your materials to get them into place. It did soften the vinyl and make it a bit stretchy, so I was careful when pushing it into place not to stretch it more. After it all dried, the vinyl tightened up nicely and stayed in place. I am now waiting for the really hot weather to see that it holds up through that. All in all, this is a great product. I was very pleased."
1,"Dewalt, what were you thinking?!","Dewalt, what were you thinking? This thing is way to expensive for a portable radio, and it's way too expensive for a charger, but maybe for the convenience of both together...... However it is severely limited as a portable radio. The batteries run down over the weekend when the thing is turned OFF. It's no good on a job site - at least not for very long. I'll put it in the shop and use it for a VERY expensive plug-in radio, but I have no Dewalt products in the shop so the charger is useless. Dewalt, I expected better from you. Don't get very far from your extension cord with this thing. Not recommended!"
1,Dewalt dropped the ball,"I purchased the radio/charger for convenince. If your charging a battery forget about reception. If I could return it for no shippng cost, I would in a second. I still use a charger separately so I can listen to the radio. This is the first time I hated a DeWalt product. I'm using it as an expensive radio(poor quality sound) in my shop."
1,DeWalt Missed the Boat on this one,"I have the first version of the DeWalt Radio and won't think about purchasing another one until DeWalt improves the battery drain issue, reception is horrible and drifts, should have a built in MP3 capable CD-R/DVD-R/DVD+R player. The aux input is a stupid idea. The Bosch unit is much closer to ideal, but all my cordless stuff is DeWalt......I hope DeWalt design teams read this and take it to heart......Do not purchase this unit!"
1,looks cool...and that's it!,"the dc011 looks neat and is undoubtedly durable, however, my new dc011 only picked up 2 radio stations when even my cheap clock radio with no antennae can pick up many times that amount. i used to like dewalt, but their products are getting worse each year. i think they are riding on their success of past years and have pretty much quit trying. i'm going to find another brand to start using."
2,"Cool design, poor performance","Durable and hi-tech design functions well overall, but battery life issues others report are all too real. And, where is the CD player? What were they thinking? Needs a little more work to be a tool I'd want to keep, so mine went back. Hit Wally World on the way back to the jobsite for a <$50 replacement with better sound quality but sans charger. I didn't really need another charger anyway."
3,Could be 5 stars but...,"I'm a contractor and like many others the gang likes the sound of a radio instead of the noise of a job site. This stereo is easy to set up, plenty of volume and does serve a purpose with the charging feature. The down side of this unit is the same as many others...the only fair reception you get unless your very close to the broadcast source, especially in a basement situation. I'm in southwest Chicago suburbs and should be able to receive stations clearly. There should be a spot to plug in an Ipod or play cd's rather than play games with the reception issue."
4,great for shop,"got two of these after doing some searching for radios for the shop. tunes in fine, loud enough, does exactly what i wanted. was also looking for a radio that was three prong to get osha off our backs, these are not so i went to home depot and got replacement cords. took about ten minutes to ""fix"". thinking about buying a third for the guys."
5,Why use anything else?,I tried buying the cheap radios to keep music going during my projects. They didn't come in well or quit working due to the less than ideal environmental conditions associated with construction. The DeWalt not only handles abuse but charges your batteries at the same time!
3,Decent but a few flaws,"Battery is great, charger is great, it looks great but it could be louder and better water proofed. It doesn't last after a splash on a river trip. If this were louder and waterproof, I'd pay three times the price."
3,Product works OK. Not the best radio on the market.,"Seems to be over priced for the sound quality it produces. I enjoy using it on my jobsite, however, you will not be overwhelmed by exceptional bass or other sound quality. Would be nice if it had automatic station scanning versus manual knob scanning capability. For the price you would expect a CD player to be included since they are very inexpensive. The ability to charge a battery while playing the radio is priceless."
1,Worst DeWalt product ever,"I finally am able to remove this piece of junk from my truck and replace it with something else. I've been a user of DeWalt and their cordless tools for some time, and generally love their products, but this one is a terrible joke. DeWalt makes fantastic tools; they need to buy these junk radios back and put out a better designed jobsite radio."
1,DEAD BATTERY,"I HAVE (2) OF YOUR WORK CHARGERS--- UNLIKE THE FIRST MODELS THAT WERE SOLD,THE NEW STYLE WILL DRAIN THE CHARGED BATTERY ---WITH THE OLD CHARGER I WOULD LEAVE THE BATTERY IN THE CHARGER AND IT WOULD BE READY WHEN I NEEDED IT------THIS NEW CHARGER STINKS---AFTER ABOUT (3) DAYS THE CHARGED BATTERY IS DEADI HOPE SOMEONE WILL CALL ME AND TAKE CARE OF THIS---I AND MY SON OWN ALL MOST EVERY DEWALT TOOLTHANKS FOR YOUR TIMERICH HENSON123 WOODRUFF ST.COLONA IL 61241309-314-1475"
1,Junk,This is worst jobsite radio I have ever had !!! Radio reception is horrible and if you charge a battery while listening to it you get the static from the charger. If you use the battery it won't last the day and when the battery runs down you lose all the programed stations. After about a week you'll want to throw it off the roof. Then it will be a real piece of junk!!
1,STAY AWAY!!,"I purchased this item so I can listen to music, during the Spring and Summer, in my back yard. I have owned DeWalt products and have always been satisfied with their performance. Let me state that the radio tuner in this unit is crap! It fades in and out of the tuned frequency. The Knob feels loose. The power drains from my Dewalt 18 volt battery even when the radio is not being used. I have to freshly charge the NiCad to keep it playing for the whole day.The unit works well with my MP3player and it is well constructed. But Again, the radio is Crap!"
2,Frustrating,"There are many reviews already here detailing the problems with this radio so I'll just add a brief summary. This radio will drain an 18-Volt tool battery in a couple days and the AA batteries seem to always be dead. So, for practical purposes, there had just as well not even be any presets since they are always being lost. I have never found reception to be stellar on FM and it is nonexistant for AM. I do work in a rural area so it may be better in a city. Sound from the speakers is decent, being able to use an iPod is nice and it does charge batteries fine."
5,Best Gift I Ever Bought My Husband,"My husband has a ton of DEWALT tools, but this one he uses every day! It sits in his Garage Kingdom plugged in and ready to go. It makes a great extra charger when he's using all the other 18-Volt tools that I bought him. Its beefy. Nice styling. Looks great where ever he takes it. Very durable."
4,Very Pleased,"I have become very pleased with this radio, when me and my father are out on a job, the ability to listen to the music and charge a battery for our tools is perfect. Highly recommend to anyone that uses the batteries this charges!"
4,DEWALT Work Site radio,"All in all a good radio so far. Only had it for a couple of weeks before being asked to review it.It charges the battery very quickly.The only complaint is that some stations that should come in clearly have a little static with them. When I touch the antenna, the stations become clear. But again, a minor amount of static.The other little thing that DEWALT could have done was create a compartment for the cord to store in as part of the casing. Right now it coils around the bottom of the radio, where it could get dirty and wet during use."
2,De-Walt work site radio,"The radio is fine, bought as a gift. Note, you need 2 AA batteries inside the radio to set the time, and also to program your stations that you like. The time is tough to set , you can get the hour , but the minutes you can't seem to nail down. It is really handy and versatile, for so many things though. My rating is not high, unfortunately because it was advertised $25.00 off the purchase of a De-Walt item of $100.00 or more and they did not honor that."
1,Three down-None to go!,"Started out with the DC911, speakers blew inside of nine monthes, (illusion of poor reception perhaps?). Bought the DC011 and it drained batteries (14 & 18 volt) OVER NIGHT, consistantly. Took it back for another try. Second DC011, six weeks in, not one push button would work. Battery charger worked OK though. Guess where that one is! Back where I bought it! I won't try again until they can guarantee it."
4,"Works just fine, exactly as designed","I have a bunch of DeWalt 18v tools, and I like music. It works just fine with my iPod plugged in, and I have faith that it will handle a dusty environment.I use it in my trailer when camping (yes, I take cordless tools camping) and it fills the trailer with decent sound. Does it sound as good as a 7.1 Dolby surround blah blah stereo? Hell no. It wasn't designed for that.It's a boom box.It recharges your DeWalt batteries.You can plug in an iPod.Who uses CDs any more?The radio works fine, but radio stations in this country are so bad, I never listen anyway."
1,Disappointed - Bad Reception,"I use to have the old DeWalt DW911 radio where I had to put a coat hanger on to get better reception. I thought that their newer unit would be better reception, boy was I wrong. The antenna is bigger, but I can only move it in 3 -directions, side to side and towards the back. The handle prevents it from going foward. I guess I will have to find a new coat hanger. It came with this plastic CD case holder, but now I have to buy a CD player to go inside."
1,FM radio went out,"I have this radio / charger but I'm not very impressed. I tried to find the old analog model, but couldn't, so I bought the digital model. After about 6 months the FM radio went out. I can get a new board, but it's $60 plus shipping from Dewalt. Other than that, I didn't have any of the other problems mentioned in the reviews. For the price it should have a CD player build in. I use a portable plugged into the Aux. port. Dewalt needs to improve on this unit."
4,luv it,"This is an amazing picture, even better when one gets to see it in person. The only problem was that I could not tell how big the actual picture was not counting the white border. I feel it is one of my favorite pictures and arrived in good time for a good price."
4,Angst as only Justine Davis can deliver!,"A Justine Davis book is always a treat and I recommend this one, especially for those who like wounded characters and loads of internal conflict, but if you're not quite up to reading 240 plus pages of angst you may want to hold off on reading this one until another day."
3,"Not great, but good.","Was hoping for more from this book, but it seems the writer's mind was managed away from the implications of his research and instead just lays a bit of the same old humdrum down for you."
5,I am very pleased with this purchase,"This microwave oven has all the bells and whistles, heats FAST and looks great!"
1,Dead - The Sequel,"February 10, 2005: Purchased this microwave based on performance specs, good looks and what (at the time) were good reviews.February 10, 2007: Dead, with smoke pouring out the bottom of the unit from burning electronics -- all accompanied by one terrified wife.I can't believe the eerie similarity to the other reviews in terms of the premature failures. I too, will never purchase another Panasonic microwave, as I've had two Kenmores that each last 10+ years."
5,"Moot, but 6+ years and going strong","This review is somewhat moot, as the microwave in question in no longer made, but I was looking to buy a second one (for another house), and saw the bad reviews. I ordered this microwave in January 2005, so over six years, this has held up very well for me. It's powerful, easy to clean, and has just been splendid. Not that anyone will see this, but I think it was a great purchase."
5,Great value!,"We bought these jars to use primarily as cups for coffee, tea and espresso. I love that they serve double duty as storage containers. They are the perfect size and I love the quilted pattern - would make beautiful jars for giving gifts of jam, lemon curd, etc.This was several dollars cheaper than I found in the store."
1,Extremely high price!,Walmart has the same exact item for half the price! I have also found the same prices at our local Targets...
1,about as wild as grass growing,"This book was a real disappointment. Pages and pages of how terrible her life was, and no zip or excitement. I hated Valentina's Rules. But this book is worse it is so deathly dull. Try something like The Captivation by Rostova, or any books by Savannah Smythe if you want to see hot stuff with real variety ahd characters you care about, not cardboard cutouts."
3,At least you should have one of this collection,NOW series offers a large amount of songs for your enjoyment. I know the 75% of this record. The fact is there's many songs out of the S.American market. There's some who only works in European or Brit markets.
4,Good all round dance cd,CD No 2 is by far the better CD. You probably will only listen to CD. No. 1 the once there after will play CD No. 2
4,In Limbo,The plot was well written and had me in suspense until the end. The main characters were real people caught in an unreal (this could never happen to me) situation. I applaud this writter's first book and look forward to more.
3,Quah!!!,"I should have read the header a little better. I was disappointed that this indeed wasn't a book by David Sedaris but essays by others. Sad... oh well, my wife likes it!!!"
2,Children Playing Before a Statue of Hercules,"I am a big fan of David Sedaris. Unfortunately this book, despite having his name on it, was not written by him. It is an anthology of works by other writers. If you are looking for a book by David Sedaris do NOT buy this book. I think Amazon could have done a much better job of making it clear that he did not write this book. I am very disappointed."
1,"HUGE disappointment! Sedaris fans, beware!","I'm a big Sedaris fan and was really looking forward to this book. Even though I knew the short stories were not written by him, I figured he probably has excellent taste and that at least some of the stories might be similar to his own work. WRONG. I slogged through about four of the stories, plus just the first few pages of about three others, and then gave up and returned this to the library. All of the stories were dismally boring and pointless. They reminded me of the stuff English teachers make you read -- loads and loads of descriptive detail, but NOTHING happens. I'm sorry, call me a philistine, but I like something with a plot or at least some sort of ""arc"" or character development -- not reading two pages devoted to how a character puts cream and sugar in his coffee. Some of these stories really read like isolated chapters pulled out of novels -- they really didn't stand alone at all."
2,Just a random collection of random short stories,"Half of these stories I have read before, and the other half I did not like. Everything in this book is pointless. First of all, Sedaris' name in big letters on the cover. Why? Because he wrote a silly introductiuon and made this awkward selection. The reason the book is published? To benefit some cause that most of us could have not cared less about. Well, I am giving two stars and not one, just because I liked the color of the cover. Kind of greenish salad color."
1,Mediocre at best,"I love David Sedaris, but his taste in literature is a little too quirky for my tastes. This is an interesting compilation of unique authors but most of the excerpts fall flat and are somewhat emotionally uneventful. Not much stands out in the book except for the first piece, ""Interpreter of Maladies"". I suggest you wait for the next David Sedaris book (if that ever comes out)."
3,"A good collection of stories -- at least, 2/3rds of them","About 2/3rds of the stories in this collection are quite good and entertaining. The other 1/3 aren't bad, they're just of varying quality."
4,Short Story Awakening,"In all my years of reading serious fiction, I've neglected short stories. But when I saw Sedaris's name, I was willing to read his introduction to see if I wanted to delve further in this collection of stories by other writers, and I'm thrilled that I did.Of all the stories in the collection, I had only read one before-Flannery O'Connor's ""Revelation""-so this collection opened up a number of new writers to me that I'll pursue further: Jincy Willett, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Richard Yates, for example.Sedaris does a good job of balancing heavily emotional rides, like Joyce Carol Oates's ""The Girl with the Blackened Eye,"" with the humor of Jincy Willett's ""The Best of Betty."" He's also done a terrific job of blending classic stories with contemporary ones.After reading this collection, I'm actually looking forward to reading more short fiction."
4,Good way to start training.,"This is a good book intended for those which want to start training. It offers a set of workouts well suited for most men and women's aims. Nutritional guidelines are great and are never based in supplements or drugs!I think that the main drawback is the lack of information concerning periodization and exercise selection (you will not know what to do after finishing some scheduled workout).As a paralel reading or further reading, I suggest Delavier's book (Strength training anatomy) and another one by Kraemer (Designing Resistance Training Programs)."
3,"Try Aeschylus, but not here","I picked up the Slavitt translation of Aeschylus Oresteia off a publisher's overstock rack at a bookstore. I have enjoyed reading these plays, however, Slavitt's translation leaves me wanting.Some have complained that Slavitt is too modern and a bit too, well, guteral. My greek is admittedly weak, but the Greeks were certainly not prudes and often this aspect is covered up in our translations.After seeing a few complaints on the web, I tried comparing a few other translations at the local library. In almost all cases I found Ted Hughes's version to be both more interesting and also clearer. Hughes, like Slavitt is not the most ""literal"" translation, but he makes it a great read.I am not enough of a Greek Scholar to recomend a more literal version, but it looks like people have good things to say about Fagles's version."
2,It was boring and made me have to go to sleep!,But other than it being boring it was pretty good. It gave a good review of history and let me see how it was back then. Thanx! APRYL AMIS
5,The Art of Gulley,"The Christmas Scrapbook is one of Philip Gulley's best crafted books. I have read all of Gulley's books, and this one has all of the charm, humor, and wisdom of the others, but it has an energy and drive I don't see in many books. I have no idea how Gulley accomplished this feeling of momentum. My wife and I recently visited Gulley's hometown, inspecting places mentioned in his nonfiction books, and the visit brought home to us dramatically that Gulley's fictional town of Harmony is indeed quite fictional and that this artist has created a beautiful, believable town that has only been suggested by the real places, such as the Courthouse Grounds coffee shop, the Royal Theater, and Blanton Woods. Reading different versions of his writing, found on Heartlight, reinforces my admiration for his ability to craft a story. I love his storytelling ability; I love his theology. Treat yourself to his books."
4,Great book,"Love this book. Great ....Phillip Gulley can take you back in time, to a simpler life and time. A must read."
2,So baaaaad!,"I bought this dvd with some level of hope, but no!, No Hope for this. I highly recommend you save your money and send the author a condolence letter about how dead this dvd/music really is.Amazon should refund my money and listen to this dvd for a couple days. They will be more disappointed than me. I won't buy any more music from Amazonoly bad.EEEEkkkk!"
5,Not for the Weary,"This 2 cd package is such a gift from the developers from who it came. All the songs are here and for the price you can't beat it. The sleeve insert folds out into one big page full of many rare band pictures and lengthy biographical stories! Always a plus given any information on this band is hard to find.Mikael Akerfeldt from the experimental death metal outfit Opeth helped, I believe, to resurrect this gem. In the numerous interviews I've read with Mikael, there is one question that seems to always be there:what music influences you? Mikaels reply is always an interesting one because you know you're going to get a list of high quality, rare, and somewhat odd music. Comus is one of those bands.If your reading this you more than likely know how bizarre the music is. Sinister beauty."
3,THEY WERE GIFT,MY GRANDSON LOVE IT.THE PACKAGE WAS WELL PRESENTED THE PRICE WAS AFFORDABLE I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY
5,Will the true serial killer please stand up?,"True, Harold Jaffe trots out the familiar lineup of culturally certified serial killers, but, then, plopped in the center, is Henry Kissinger. Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, along with his mentor and competitor, Richard Nixon, Kissinger is the real villain of Jaffe's remarkably subtle volume. Kissinger's licit murders--Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, East Timor--are not merely overlooked, but applauded by the sheepish culture, even as the illicit individual serial killer, such as the impoverished, abused Aileen Wuornos, is sanctimoniously vilified.It is the capitalist culture that condemns in order to consume that is Jaffe's real target, and as usual his aim is unerring.This volume is as revolutionary as it is courageous."
1,Repetition,"I picked this book up on finals week at the SDSU Bookstore because I've seen multiple copies sitting there, unsold, and kinda felt sorry for this faculty member and his brand of odd fiction. Now I want to take it back. I have read some of Jaffe's other books but this is exactly the same as the others. His talky stories all have the same voice and all have the same theme, with no character development, no emotion, no plot, no structure, and not even a hint of good writing development. It's repetition after repetition and grows old, very old, very fast. One may hope the author may try to expand his horizons and content in his next book."
5,I love my sister,"Xmas came and so did my gift. This is a VERY well made product. Well stiched, no defects. The leather is lined with a flannel material. The belt clip is solid, backed up and stiched in. It swivels, with stops vertical and horizontal, which is very important. This clip won't be coming off any time soon. The iphone fits its case snuggly. It feels good in the hand and even elegant. It slides in to the holster firmly. Comes out smoothly. No feeling whatsoever of losing it or it popping out or slipping off no matter what. You can insert phone into case in any direction, face in, out, up, down. Acess to all buttons, speakers, jacks. I love it."
5,Best Autobiography I have ever read,"I am also a Cahuilla woman and I know this person personally, she was my grandmother, so I know that what she has put into this book is truth. She taught me many things and many of them are in this book. If you have a chance to read it - it comes very highly recommended by another Cahuilla Indian."
5,cool blue,"This is a great looking watch, I love the blue face. It is the perfect scale for a woman's wrist, but not too girly looking. Works great too!"
5,Excellent Fan,"The fan went up very easily, more easily than Hunter's 5 minute fans. The fan has a sleek modern look. The fan is quiet, wobble free, and moves an incredible amount of air."
5,Excellent fan - plan to buy more,"The fan operates flawlessly, very quiet, and well balanced. The remote control is convenient . It's located in a contemporary Decor family room with high ceiling connected to a 2-foot down rod, it looks real nice. I'm planning to get a smaller one for the kitchen."
3,Poor Sound,"I own both the orginal vinyl LP and this CD. The CD sound is so compressed and lacking in dynamic range that it significantly detracts from the music. Treble and bass are compresed into the mid-range. Great songs, good blues; each flowing into the next to form an enjoyable whole. Too bad the sound is so lacking."
4,unsung brit blues/fok/jazz group,"sounding alternately like the early, bluesy/jazzy Mick Abrahams-era Tull and an ace imitation Chicago/Texas blues band, these guys were good songwriters and players...way better than Savoy Brown and other second-tier progressive Brit blues/rock outfits. Every cut is good (all originals except two great blues covers), and several are standouts.Only drawback is the somewhat weak but OK faux-black vocals."
2,"Nice, but not for a laptop","First off, this product is not 23""W x 16""D, it is closer to 22""W x 14""D. Does not leave enough room with a 15"" laptop to use a mouse, or it my case even hold my checkbook while I would work on bills(which is why I wanted it). Secondly, with the laptop on it, the laptop gets very hot and the laptop fans spin constantly. Not good. This would be good for eating, doing craft work or the such, but it is not good for a computer. I will be returning this and looking for something else."
5,The Lapp Topper,"The Lapp Topper is great. I have a place for my beverage, be it a glass or a mug, I have a place for my remotes: TV, DVD player, DVR. (All three.) I am a beadworker, and if there's an upset my beads are not scattered everywhere. In fact, the edge is high enough that it keeps the beads from rolling off.The mat, (I can't think of the name of it), keeps my platter or whatever else I'm using to hold the beads, in place. I can eat from it, play with my beads from it, read a book from it, you name it.In fact, I am about to order two more to give as gifts.Anira M. Golden"
4,Great!,"I bought this for working on homework (reading, taking notes, etc) on the couch. I had been experiencing a lot of back pain from all the hunching over I had been doing, and this lap desk definitely helps. I wish it would have been ""fuller"" (it sometimes gets a bit lop-sided because the beads have shifted to one side or the other), but otherwise, I'm very happy with it."
4,Almost new,"This book is almost new, but I dont like the stories in it. I expect it to be a ""cookbook"" for qualitative research. But it turns out to be a story-driven reflection on doing qualitative research. Suggest for out-of-class, ""disposal"" reading."
4,Voltron in Japanese!,This is it! Voltron has you have never seen it! Beastking Golion collection 3! This is the third and final collection for Lion Force Voltron series. Get these Japanese with English subtitled episodes because they are very different from the American Cartoon counterparts we are use to. It contains episodes 37-52! This is Voltron/Golion as you have never seen it! Highly Recommended it! A
5,Amazing,"When I first heard that they were FINALLY going to bring GoLion to America, I was super excited. I am a huge Voltron fan, love the series but always wondered just what was the real Japanese anime like? What really happened to ""Sven?"" (Hahaha.) Come on, we all know he didn't survive :) Was Sincline really more evil than Lotor? What the heck was the deal with Zarkon and Lotor's mother? The series did not disapoint - I fully enjoyed the entire collection and have all three GoLion DVD sets. It's the real story, a slight violent and nastier side to it than Voltron which was cut up and pieced together by World Events to fit America's youth audience at the time.Sure the music is corney and the show a bit bizarre, but come on - huge robot lions in space and a super handsome evil badguy Prince makes up for the sillyness. You can't argue with that!"
5,Just what I needed,"This is a good, solid grille. I just needed a vent between downstairs and upstairs, so this fit the bill perfectly. A fine product."
3,3* for sending it on time,"According to Amazon's product selector, this filter would fit in my 93 Subaru Legacy. But, no it does not, it is shorter in length by few inches and wider as well. Thank you Amazon for taking it back, but you guys seriously need to fix the product selector. The product itself is perfect but I could not use it unfortunately. Right part number should be 33-2232."
2,Very little that you don't already know about the players.,"Featured players: Jaromir Jagr, Daniel Alfredsson, Pavel Bure, Chris Chelios, Peter Forsberg, Wayne Gretzky, Jarome Iginla, Saku Koivu, Eric Lindros, Patrick Roy, Joe Sakic, Teemu Selanne, Brendan Shanahan, Mats Sundin, Oleg Tverdovsky, John Vanbiesbrouck, and Doug Weight. I was surprised that players like Brett Hull, Mike Modano, Curtis Joseph, and Mark Messier weren't included in this book. Okay pictures, but you can get more information about these players by reading a scouting report."
4,"A good plot and interesting twists, but the pace was rushed","I waited on this book and was eager to read it. The story was good and filled in a lot of the backstory to not only the new Enterprise but the Bohzman crew also. After the story shifts to the 24th century things get rushed though. There was a lot going on and a lot of hard work by the characters, but the situations were resolved too quickly. There were too many coincidences and anticlimatic saves. Characters seem to come out of left field, are used, then discarded. I really liked the plot and enjoyed reading the book but felt as if there were at least 50 pages of the story that were cut somewhere from Carey's desk to the bookshelf. I do recommend the book though as long as you read it expecting a good story that could have been executed a little better."
4,"Audio adaption is solid, but unremarkable","Author Carey tosses in a lot of material (time travel, Captain Morgan Bateson, Kirk, Klingons, Scotty, Cardassians, etc.) here, and it doesn't quite gel as well as it could. Being an abridged audio, I knew going in that some elements from the book may be compromised, but the adaption is faithful to the novel (for better and worse). The tapes have their ups and downs as the story develops, but I generally found myself looking forward to the next plot advancement. Note that Kevin Conway does a GREAT job with the narration--his voice is powerful and he captures the listener's attention. Having the well known actors from the Star Trek universe perform the readings never fails to bring the story alive for me. Overall, I found the story lingered with me (in a positive way) longer than I expected. SHIP OF THE LINE is a solid, yet unremarkable entry into the Star Trek audio universe."
3,Good but could have been better,"For a Star Trek book by Diane Carey, I was let down. I have come to expect so much more from her. From what seemed to be a pretty great story from the book jacket turned out to be a dry dull story. And sadly a lot of the material was unneeded. All of the holographic orginal series scenes were rehased stories that we have seen. Too much space fillers. I am glad to have the filled in part of TNG history. That made this book worth it."
4,The entertaining first voyage of the Enterprise-E,"Diane Carey continues her tremendous writing success in the Star Trek universe with this exciting and original novel. The story chronicles the maiden voyage of the newest Federation flagship, the U.S.S. Enterprise-E, as it proceeds under the command of not Jean-Luc Picard, but Morgan Bateson, the captain who traveled with his crew forward into the 24th century. Carey uses great detail in defining the characters of the novel, including Picard who is contemplating his future in Starfleet, and Bateson who is considering his role in an entirely different century. Plenty of action and epic space battles exist throughout the novel to complement the strong plot and characterization. With Ship of the Line, Diane Carey creates yet another worthy addition to the Star Trek universe."
2,Diane Carey should've taken more time to write this book!,"The story itself was okay, with some interesting details. The events of ""First Contact,"" ""Cause and Effect,"" and the original series episodes were well told. Unfortunatlely, it juggled too many stories and had some really annoying incongruities with regard to the movies and series. First, Klingons don't live quite so long, so Bateson's enemy probably wouldn't be alive after all this time. Second, didn't anybody PROOFREAD this book!? I can understand the occasional misspelling of a big word, but ""Alfa 177""!? I think if the author had taken more time to get down some of the small details and have somebody proofread her book, it would have come out much better. The story is good, it just needs to focus on one or two of the big storylines."
4,pretty decent fun,"Yes, I hate to admit it but I read a Star Trek novel. I haven't read one for years, but this one was on sale at the dollar store so I picked it up. I also hate to admit it, but I liked it.The plot focuses on the time between the 2 movies Generations and First Contact. It involves Captain Morgan Bateson, the captain played by Kelsey Grammar (a.k.a. Dr. Frasier Crane) in one episode of the Next Generation series. It deals with his forced time travel of 90 years into the future and Picard's angst over the loss of his ship. Kirk is also in it thanks to great holodeck programs. Yes, it is way too cluttered and the ending is hackneyed, as most things Trek are, but it was an entertaining read. A great novel would have dealt in-depth with the issues of a captain w/out a ship or a man living out of his own time, but who expects to find great literature at the dollar store?"
4,Reviewers need to brush up on their Trek Tech before reviewing,"I've noticed here and else where that a lot of people reviewing star trek books have little to no idea about the star trek universe. Anyone who is anyone know that humans can live well pass the 100 year mark in the star trek universe and that's due to medical advancement. Klingons live past the 100 year mark because naturally they have a longer life span than humans. (I'm speaking as if said Klingon lived a full life and wasn't killed in combat. Rare I know.) Anyone remember Kor from DS9 anyone who was well past the 100 year mark when he died?Also Alfa and Alpha are correct spelling for the same word. If you opened up a dictionary or even bothered to read more voraciously you'd know that.If you're going to give a book a bad review that's fine, but do so with all the facts and make sure you cross your Ts and dot your Is before you click the submit icon."
1,UGH!!! This book is not to be tossed lightly aside . . .,"but rather thrown with great force.The plot was far too boring with far too little happening in way too many pages. Carey spends way too much on minor characters not enough and not good enough time on the major characters and the plot just isn't that interesting.And let's be honest this novel simply isn't well written. The pace is completely off, character development is haphazard and bizarre, the dialogue leaves a lot to be considered and frankly the descriptions of people, places and situations are silly. None of the characters are likable - even Picard - my long time favorite - is distastefully trivial and absurd. This novel just isn't very good. Which is a shame because this book had great potential."
3,Not one of Diane's better books,"This one really didn't do much for me. A lot of it was really implausible...like the fact that, with all the time-traveling we've seen in Trek, they still don't take that into consideration when considering a captain's tenure! Sorry, I just don't buy them giving the Ship of the Line to someone who is out of his time. Many of the other characterizations just don't work for me, like Picard being so upset by losing the Enterprise. We saw him at the end of Generations, and he did not look like someone grieving over-much for the ship.That said, once you get into it, the book does for the most part hold your attention. It bounces around a bit much and the various plots are all resolved much too quickly in the end. Not one of the worst Trek novels by any means, but not one I'm likely to read again."
1,Simply awful,"It's been about a year since I read a Star Trek novel. It was Peter David's deplorable ""I, Q."" After reading the equally regeattable ""Ship of the Line"" I think I'll wait another year. My love of the original cast is as deep as anyone's but KIRK IS DEAD! Let him rest. No holodeck recreations, no reincarnations, no nothing. I was also put off by the hurried nature of the ending.""Hey, did you catch the saboteur that's been mentioned every other chapter?""""Oh yeah, it was just some dude.""And that's it.I've only read two other Star Trek/Diane Carey books (""Final Frontier"" and ""Dreadnought"") and they were infinitely superior to this slop of a novel."
2,"Thankfully, I got it on the bargain pyramid...","This was, well, awful.It seems like the author bit off more than she could chew. She drew together plots with Captain Bateman and his crew (from the TNG Episode ""Cause and Effect,""), brought in the brand new Enterprise-E, tied in Scotty, the Gul that tortured Picard in ""Chain of Command,"", some previous-century Klingons, and - oh yes - a holodeck recreation of Kirk. And tribbles.The result is an alarmingly out-of-character mash of crossovers that leaves you feeling like you're reading a comedy, not a science fiction novel. The only thing that redeemed this book at all to me was the plight of Captain Bateman and his crew, stranded far ahead of their own timeline. They were interesting. The rest was not.Skip this one, unless you'd like to know more about the crew of the USS Bozeman. But go to a library."
1,these are junk,Couldnt even get through the hole the first time...had to run to home depot to buy a real hole saw to finish the job.
2,Works good in Fir,"Well, what can you expect for the price.It may cut through Fir just fine, but trying to cut through either CDX or OSD Plywood dulled the blade within seconds.This set just isn't worth it."
2,Sylver;s Best Song on her Second Album (Little Things),"I think this Vinyl album does good for Sylver because this (in my opinion was the only good song on her second album (Little Things). I think The Radio and Extended Versions of the song are the favorites of the vinyl album, but the other two mixes don't do as well. The Groove Coverage Mix was ok...., but the Filterheadz mix was worth skipping. It has an annoying beat and it ruins the good song we started out with. I give it a 2 for a good reason... because there are only 2 good songs on the vinyl cd. I recommend only buying if you are a huge Sylver fan or if you are collecting Vinyl albums(other than that), don't buy it!!!"
5,spy glasses,"some thing i could not believe it , you can see behind what is going on.realy it is good products"
4,Good for ME,"I am NOT following the method outlined in The Well-Trained Mind for my children, choosing instead to follow the principles laid out in A Thomas Jefferson Education (Oliver Van DeMille - George Wythe College Press), but I AM using many of the resources in this book for my own development. I liked the organizational structure of studying history chronologically. It helped me to find a starting place, which prior to reading this book I had been having a hard time doing.Susan Wise Bauer has another book called The Well Educated Mind that has reading suggestions that have given me a good jumping off place.I highly recommend this book as an interesting read and a fascinating book to discuss with other homeschoolers."
4,A great resource for homeschoolers,This is an excellent resource for homeschoolers with extensive curriculum guidelines. My only negative is that the resources are aimed at the American homeschooling market and are not readily available in Australian libraries/bookshops.
3,I was hoping for more,"I read the original version of ""The Well Trained Mind"" checked out from a local library several years ago and was very impressed. As my children are nearing school age, I decided to buy the book intending to use it as a resource to suppliment their education. The revised edition disapointed me. Though I appreciated more up to date resources and ordering information, the authors omitted many resources that they recommended in the first edition that are still available in favor of their own books. I found that a great disservice to a very loyal readership. It significantly lowered my opinion of the author's character and credibility. Though I still plan on using the method presented, I don't think I will be buying any more of their material."
4,I was a bit disappointed...,"I have the old edition of The Well-Trained Mind and just received the revised edition. It has been a great book overall, but I was hoping for more information on different classical curriculums offered out there. They also took out the books they recommended for history and grammar (in the grammar stage) and inserted the books that they have written. I thought that was a bit biased and very self serving on their part. They should have recommended their own books, but also included others as good alternatives. There is not as much change to the book as I had hoped."
5,Well Trained Mind Review,"This book is excellent. It would be great for any homeschooler, but is, I believe, a requirement for any one interested in the classical approach. It is engaging and easy reading as well as informational as a resource to guide academic milestones from grade to grade. I absolutely love it. It was worth the few extra dollars to put this on our shelf. Definitely get it!"
4,homeschooling resource,"It's quite a book to undertake, but I'm tackling it in bits and pieces. It has been a useful tool in homeschooling my child."
5,Not just for homeschoolers - supplement to a public school education,"I really appreciate The Well Trained Mind. I have been trying to decide how we should educate our young daughter. I think she would do extremely well if she was homeschooled, but since my husband and I both work full time, homeschooling is out. After reading the WTM, I have opted to send her to the local public school and then augment the curriculum ourselves with classical studies. The WTM has given me so many great ideas and tools. This summer, we've started the study of world history using ""The Story of the World"" series, and it is going very well. My daughter eats the information up and we have a great time doing the projects together at home. So, even tho we're not homeschoolers, the information in this book has still been very helpful for us."
4,Good book,I found this book to be very helpful in giving me the knowledge to educate my children at home. Very thorough yet I would have loved an update.Some book or reference books were out of date.
5,More Information than I expected!,As as first year Christian homeschooling mother I need all of the help I can get. This guide to a classical education is priceless. The information is very easy to understand and the authors provide the encouragement and tools step by step to begin this endeavor. I have dog-eared many of the pages and highlighted even more text. An absolute must have for those providing a classical education at home!
2,Search,"You all should read the review for The Well-Trained Mind at http://www.classical-homeschooling.org/curriculum/class-ed.html#wilson-homeschoolThe book#1 Is A Guide to Classical Education:Grammar, Logic and Rhetoric#2 It's a mother and daughter teaching and learning experiences#3 It has a SECULAR view of education#4 Biblical perpectic or building a Biblical worldview is not the base of it#5 It divorces Genesis from Science and History"
4,Explains exactly how to homeschool,"This book is my favorite homeschooling resource book. It explained to me why my kids would benefit from a classical education and how to do it step by step and year by year. We are following the athors' plans for history and science. I refer back to this book regularly and highly recommend it, especially for those lost in a sea of ""where do I begin?"" and curriculum questions."
2,Overwhelming,"I think this book tries to overwhelm someone trying to teach their child. I can't imagine a child being happy being taught so rigorously and will be isolated and overstressed with such intense hours of school. (A lot of public and private schools have the same problem) I don't trust the advice of teaching about all religions at such young ages. They need to be grounded in their own culture and religion first. I'd get a simpler construct of a classical education or you'll go nuts. Also, read John Taylor Gatto for guidance."
5,Just what I needed.,I have been interested in the classical method of homeschooling since I started 2 years ago. This is THE book for me. The descriptions are very detailed and fairly easy to follow. The list for reading are great. I only wish my local library had more of them. The only thing I would change about the book is that the listings for materiels needed are after each subject instead of grouped at the end of each section.
5,Wonderful reference!,"Once again Wendy Zomlefer has provided us with a beautiful, yet very functional, work of art. This book is an excelent reference for both the general public and the seasoned botanist."
1,Ambrose Bierce is a Better Authority,"I have rented this video for the sake of a trip down Memory Lane. Of course, fourteen years produce a great shift in gullibility. I hated this video for its teaching of American ideology in perhaps the least open manner imaginable. For example, in"
3,No More Kings,"No more Kings was a mediocre cartoon. The song was fairly accurate, and also was missing some major things. The cartoon was missing the years in between 1620, and 1750. That definitely confused me, and could confuse other people. The cartoon was also misleading when it said that the pilgrims were in America first, which when the Indians were there first. The song also said that the pilgrims grew their own food and built their houses, when the Indians taught them to do that. Although the cartoon was a little bit false, it still was fairly accurate when it explained how America was independent. The lyrics of the song were also right when it mentioned the Boston Tea Party. To improve this cartoon, the writers would have to adjust the mistakes, and make them true. No more Kings was a mediocre cartoon about the times before the revolution."
2,No More Kings,"I don't think ""No More Kings"" was a very good cartoon. Even if it was directed toward little kids it still should have been more accurate. They skipped from the Pilgrims arriving in America to the colonists wanting to rebel without even mentioning the French and Indian War. They also were not very accurate at depicting the events. For instance, they showed the Boston Tea Party as people dumping tea off a dock, when they were really dressed as Indians on a boat. I understand they only have a limited amount of time, but if they depicted the events correctly they would have at least made the cartoon a little better."
2,History rock Review,"""No More Kings,"" the Schoolhouse rock cartoon is very insubstantial and partially incorrect. One reason for this is because there is some false information, particularly about why the pilgrims came to America, and what happened when they got there. Second, there is too big a jump in time. The cartoon goes from the pilgrims to the actual colonies, and some students may think that the colonies came right after the pilgrims. In addition to there being too big a gap of time, the cartoon needs more detail. After I read it and heard, I was asking myself why these events happened, and were there any other events. Lastly, besides having more detail about events, this cartoon needs more detail about certain people. I didn't see the names Squanto, George Washington, John Adams, mentioned anywhere. Please, do not buy this cartoon, the editors need to add information to it to make it complete and educational."
5,Always Have Loved It; Always Will Love It.,"I always enjoyed the School House Rock series when I was a kid. Of course, the series had been out for some time before I saw them on VHS. I bought this on VHS because my son, who is 6, took interest in the other two tapes we have left. I figured I would get it for him in this format because the VCR is down where he can get to it and many of his other movies are on VHS (way cheaper). We plan on buying the whole set for a Christmas present this year, but figured we could test his lasting interest on a cheaper version first. I would recommend this product to anyone. I love the nostalgia of School House Rock along with the lessons it teaches both to children and adults everywhere."
2,No More Kings Review,"I read the lyrics to the cartoon, ""No More Kings."" Most of the information was correct, but some wasn't. It's wonderful that your turning history into fun lyrics for children, it's just that it would be better if all the information was right. For example, there is a big time gap that confused me at first. The lyrics also say that, ""They were missin' mother England"" which they weren't. Another verse that was incorrect was when they said, ""They planted corn you know."" It wasn't entirely wrong though. They did plant corn, just not by themselves, the Indians helped them. The line, ""They hoped to find a better home"" could've been more specific. It would've been better if it said that they hoped to live in the Americas because that's what they wanted. Overall, I think it could've been more accurate."
3,A Shot Heard Round the World (One of the Songs(,"""The Shot Heard Round the World"" is an amusing song that is fairly historically accurate. Some verses, especially the verse about Saratoga, are very simplified but otherwise haven't changed. (Saratoga is never mentioned, although its effects are clearly explained.) The only truly major error is in the description of Valley Forge, where it is written as if this miserable winter camp occurred immediately preceding the Battle of Trenton, when it actually happened a year later. The song also glazes over a lot of the suffering there, but that's expected, since it was written for little kids. Young children will find this song both entertaining and informative."
5,Just love your Elsie books!,This book series is outstanding for young girls from about second or third grade on up through high school. I am an adult and have totally enjoyed reading these books; they have held my interest and are never boring. I am so excited to find books that instill the scriptures. I will share them with my grand-daughters and with other young friends.
5,Love them.,I love these books. I am giving them to my 13 year old granddaughter to read. I love the Christian messages they contain.
3,Elsie's Troubled Times,"My daughter read the first 4 books and loved them, so I got her the rest. I think they were alot of drama and sad times to tell you the truth. I think she didn't ""Love"" them but read them because she likes to finish what she started."
5,another great wood cop novel......,"This is the fourth woods cop novel I have read and as usual, completely enjoyed it. If you enjoy the great outdoors or northern michigan, and then throw in a mystery with it,then this is the series for you.... I sure hope MR. Heywood continues a long and many volume involvement in this series....."
2,The Key Cabinet pictured is not the one I received...,"The picture on the order page shows a 5 button number lock. Pretty neat. The description also states: ""Number key pad push button entry"" Awesome... but the item that I received did not have a combination ""number key pad push button entry"" lock. It had no lock whatsoever, which is an important factor in purchasing a key cabinet for me. False advertising... or an honest mistake? We shall see..."
1,Not What's Advertised Buyer Beware,"They advertise with the picture and Technical Details that it has Number key pad push button entry, and Spring loaded door. It does not have either and it's very hard to open the door. This will be going back! It was false advertising. I could probaby buy it in a local store for $10.00 the way this was made."
3,Some classics,"I bought this album in large part because way back when, I heard a version of ""TB Sheets"" on the soundtrack to the movie ""Dogfight"" and loved it. I think this album has a different version of the song, however, and I don't like it as much. As a cohesive album, I'd go for ""Astral Weeks"" over this one every time. One song on this album I could live without hearing ever again--even truly great songs can be killed by repetition. But a few are in my rotation. There is just something about Van Morrison's voice and songwriting that are just great."
3,CLASSIC VAN,"Original versions of ""Beside You"", ""Madame George"", and ""T.B. Sheets"" which was later recorded by John Lee Hooker on his ""You'll Never Get Out Of These Blues Alive"" that included VM himself. Was a good party album in the 70's."
5,Having Your Baby Through Egg Donation,This is by far the best book written on considering having a child through donated ovum. It was informative and interesting. I liked the fact that the authors are pro disclosure regarding telling the child and that they delineate what the donor should know about the child as well. The authors do not use a lot of medical lexicon but they still remain infromative about the process.

4,Recipes Designed for Your Phase,"Phase 1 Low Carb Diet Cookbook as well as Phase 11 Low Carb Diet Cookbook by Better Homes and Gardens, are geared for every kind of cook.Simple ingredients to find (not so with other low carb books, i.e. South Beach, as I had to go to three stores before I got all ingredients for one dish)!Recipes are easy to follow, and simple enough to make for the novice cook.Items are visually attractive, tasty, not dry, bland and uninviting as some low carb recipes tend to be.The fats included might be a bit high for those following diets that sharply cut fats along with carbs, though one can adjust them to suit with little effort.All of the recipes I have made were so tasty, that even some non-low carb dieters requested them when I made them for potluck dinners!!!"
3,Not bad...,but not all that great either. Lots of the same old recipes that every other low carb cookbooks have. Just not what I was hoping for.
5,Absolutely beatiful!,"I have read ""Amphibian Man"" by Aleksandr Belyaev and then I watched this movie. Wow! It's really great! I like it even more than book. Beautiful, beautiful movie! Highly recommended"
2,The Amphibian Man,"I saw this movie long time ago in the movie theater. I know I liked it then. Some thing must have changed. May be it is my age. When I saw the movie in DVD, I was totally disappointed. The DVD quality was very poor. The story was average. I regret buying this movie.M.Rahman"
4,Very readable,It would have been nice to extend the coverage south to include Bangkok but the necessary scale would make the map pretty difficult to read. One probably just needs to buy the Bangkok map to go with it.
3,complete but dissapointing,i wanted to know more about art nouveau jewelry and this book really helped me for that purpose.it has lots of pictures and info about whatever there is to know and see.the only dissapointment was that majority of the pics are in black and white. You miss out on all the enameling work colors..also i expected to see more from lalique.overall though its a good book for starters.

5,Joe Haldeman's Secret Best,"I remember when Hemingway hoax first came out. It made a huge splash in sci fi and literary circles as a reimagining of the life and cultural significance of the great writer himself. This is a well researched ""multiple worlds"" sort of novel delivered in Haldeman's compact, evocative style. He doesn't skimp on big ideas. He doesn't shy away from sex and violence, either. Hemingway hoax is a short novel, but it covers a surprising amount of ground. It reminded me why I became a Haldeman fan so long ago."
3,The Author Must Be a Big Fan of Ernest,"The author took an event in Hemmingway's career and seemed to create a whole ""what if"" story behind it. Hemmingway supposedly had some early manuscripts stolen from a train. In the book, a University professor is approached by a con man to produce a forgery of what he speculated Hemmingway wrote and try to make it look legit. This involves finding a typewriter similar to the one that Hemmingway used and the same type of paper.Unfortunately when the professor attempts to do this is throws some balance off in the Universe and he is interrupted by a being who kills him to prevent him from pulling off the forgery. However, the professor is transferred to alternate selves in parallel universes, where he continues the attempt.The book is pretty silly and seems it was only written because of the author's fascination with Hemmingway. It does have some interesting parts but the silliness made it difficult to give it more than 3 stars."
5,"Is it about the Well? Well, it's well-written. :-)","Katie is a wonderful writer full of inspirational sparks. If anyone can write without leaving a trace of writing, she would be that person.I remember being struck dumb after spotting her cover story about the WELL in Wired, which served as the ground for this book. It's such an astonishing and compelling story.As a guest professor in Berkeley, she has led me into a new world, through the WELL. The Well is probably the most influential online community in the world and a pool for talents, weird but wonderful. Want to know the secret of it?Well? This book would be it. (I would also recommend Katie's articles in New York Times, which are just wonderful as normal.)"
2,Lightweight story.,"This books feels like the author might even have been thinking of writing a Darkover children's book. There is almost no conflict. What should have been a tense story of twin brothers separated from infancy, each of whom thinks he is the sole heir of the kingdom, works out far too neatly and with unrealistically little fuss. The main reason to get this book would be to complete a Darkover collection. I wouldn't seek it out otherwise."
3,Weak? Yes. Terrible? No. Enjoyable? I thought so.,"The story is more simplistic than Bradley's best work, yes.It is not the best Darkover story, and not one I'd advise starting off with.However, for those familiar with the setting, it's an enjoyable tale, perhaps on par with _Star of Danger_: fun, light reading in a familiar world."
3,back jacket summary,"from the back cover of the September 1990 Daw paperback editioncover illustration by Richard HescoxThe Heirs of Hammerfell plunges us straight into the midst of a devastating clan feud between two of these realms-Hammerfell and Storn-just as Storn has struck what may prove Hammerfell's death stroke, setting the ancestral castle ablzae, slaying its lord, and sending its lady fleeing into the night with her twin infant sons, Alastair and Conn.Conn is separated from his mother that fateful night, but she and Alastair find sanctuary in Thendara City, among the wealthy and the laran-gifted. Yet Conn, too, survives, to be raised in secret among those who would see Storn overthrown. But it is not until Conn's laran manifests that the fates of the twins are finally, inextricably linked in a pattern which could bring a new beginning or total ruin to Hammerfell and its heirs..."
4,Great sound and image,"You can't imagine how wonderfull is for someone living in southern Europe where country music concerts are almost non existent, to watch a DVD with the quality sound and image of this one. I hope many other country music artists can do the same: To record a high quality DVD that brings to your home a concert or concerts you don't have the oportunity to see, specially if you don't live in England, Ireland or Holland. Thanks, Randy!"
5,Another excellent performance!,"This was another of Randy's excellent peformances! My husband and I recently saw Randy Travis (again) in live concert, and this CD just re-captured his wonderfully talented voice, his boyish charm and appeal, and it brought back such fond memories of his live performance for us. There just is no other voice quite like Randy's and as soon as he begins to make a sound you know who it is! ""It's just a matter of time""...! We also enjoyed the back-stage relevations by Randy; he's just a good ol' country boy at heart and he's down right human!"
4,Why Widescreen?,I wonder why the big push to widescreen for music videos? Is it really that expensive to use the backside of the DVD for full screen? I would have rated it 5 stars if they gave us a choice.GREAT CONCERT!
1,Don't Give to a Friend,"This DVD had great potential. I have been to his live concerts, but this DVD falls flat. I had to sell it to a reseller, I could not bear to watch it again. There is no energy to his stage presence. How did it ever get produced?"
3,book is lacking in content,"This book addresses only a small number of the many irish names. The author in the introduction states that he is only listing 80 out of a possible 3,500 names??? I couldn't find any I was looking for. There must be better books on this subject.Joseph Craig"
4,Helpful Reference Source Only,Good source of frequently used first names in both Irish and English and their meanings. Lists of the most prominent Irish family names with crest (no color) and short history. Final section lists some Irish placenames and meaning of words.
3,It had an interesting history of my name...,"It had an interesting history of my name (Ronald) at least. It told me ""Ronald: from Rögnvaldr, a Norse name (of which Reginald is a modern variant) became Raonull amongst the Gaels of Scotland, from which came the English Ronald, a name still used in modern Ireland."" Not a lot of details, but that's more than I had known. No references, so I have to trust that the information is correct."
5,ANOTHER LOGGINS FIRST!,"12 Platinum albums10 Gold albums20 million solo albums sold internationallyGrammy Award for Best Male Pop VocalGrammy Award for Song of the YearGrammy nomination for Best Children's AlbumAcademy Award nomination(movie)Tony nomination(Broadway musical)Emmy nomination for Outstanding Original SongSince the breakup of Loggins & Messina, Kenny has continued as a solo musician, and has become one of the most highly acclaimed and decorated artists in the business,surrounding himself with only the finest musicians in the industry.Kenny'S versatility has been seen and heard in every genre of entertainment. But, just when you think, He's done it all, he doing it again.Along with acclaimed Nashville singer/songwriters GARY BURR and GEORGIA MIDDLEMAN a new ""BAND"" has been formed called ""THE BLUE SKY RIDERS""Rather than go on about this unbelievable new sound here, check them out for yourselves at: blueskyridersband.c o mand let me know what you think!"
3,"mostly good, one major disappointment","Loggins remains in great form on this disc and many of the songs are among the best he's ever written. Unfortunately, on ""The Real Thing"" he buys into the myth that his divorce will, eventually, be the best thing for his children even though they may not understand that now. Scores of children of divorced parents can attest that this is rarely the case. ""I did it for you, and the boys"" -- doesn't ring true, sorry. You did it for yourself Kenny...be a man and admit it."
5,The Best Album of Kenny Loggins,"Back in 1991 I bought the cassette of Leap of Faith. I discovered a very interesting history in it. The singer telling us the different stages of a common human being. From a single man who was looking for a dream to a family man resolving his troubles with the family, but always, fundamented in love.There is a lot of phylosophy inside each song.In 1998 I bought the ""Kenny Loggins Live in the Grand Canyon VHS Cassette"" which is the maximum expresion of the album: to sing ""Leap of Faith album"" in front of common people, a majestic piece of art.If you ever thought that Loggin's trademark were ""Footloose or danger zone, For the Fist Time, Forever or even Back to Avalon"", you will understand the you were wrong, because you'll find the essence of Kenny in the album, his life, his experience, his message and his legacy to the people who was lucky to hear his music during the 70-90's decades."
3,DIAMONDS IN THE HOFF,ITS TOO BAD this cd wasn't better because there are some great pieces on here. Manic Monday and Walk like an Egyptian stand out. That artist once called PRINCE actually worked on this cd and even wrote Manic Monday. And Susan Huffs is an actress in Hollywood so they have good credentials. So I would rate it as average and not being that good a date offering. Passable at most.
2,so/so,after hero takes a fall they lost there edge and were forced to being a cover band.though manic monday was and is still catchy today it was the kiss of death as far as there artistic growth. and they went from being underground to a 2nd tier version of heart. eventually landed into sap land with songs like eternal flame.this group should have been bigger.
2,Eternal Flame is the Hilight,"Whether or not it tore the band up, the best song on here is ""Eternal Flame"". The only other good song on here is ""Manic Monday"", a stupid, but fun song... ""Walk like an Egyptian"" is just stupid, without the fun. And most of the other songs are sleepers."
3,There are much better choices.,"Some fairly boring choices were made on this collection to reflect sales, not quality. I second the opinion that anyone who really wants to collect these should start with All Over the Place -- far and away the best of the Bangles. Those who are interested in more recent work by the coolest Bangle, Vicki Peterson, should pick up the Continental Drifters' album, available on Amazon."
5,This is the very first CD I ever got and it is great!,"This is the very first CD I ever got, I got it for Christmas one year along with the CD player, and it is still one of my favorite CDs!"
5,Great Bangles CD,"The Bangles are one of my favorites. This collection of their Greatest Hits is fantastic. If you are a Bangles fan, I highly suggest that you purchase it.Theres nothing like listening to ""Manic Monday"", ""Hazy Shade of Winter"" or ""Eternal Flame"" to bring back memories.They are one of the best female bands on the scene and they created some of the best songs. This CD highlights those great songs."
5,Greatest Hits!,"If you loved the songs of the Bangels way back when, then you will love this CD as they truly do have the BEST of their songs on here. Love this CD!!"
2,deterioration?,"Its an alright shirt but the thin 'outline' part of the paint started coming off after the first wash, even with it inside out.."
2,Not a good print,"I bought this because the reviews for another, earlier version, the Korean import DVD, bemoaned that one's poor picture quality. When this one became available, I hoped it was a legitimate and faithful DVD. But this one looks terrible too. I see I am not the only person still waiting for a clean restored print on DVD, one worthy of both the original and of today's technological capacity to render it in all its beauty and glory."
3,Trip down memory lane,"I had read the reveiws about the poor quality of these dvd releases and expected the worst but all in all it wasn't that bad. If anyone is expecting new millinium, clear as day picture, they will be dissapointed. But if you're like me and absolutly need to seek out your old favorites to take a trip down memory lane this is a joy and a bargain. If a re-mastered version ever comes out, I (as well as anyone else who loves this film) will buy it in a heartbeat."
2,Kinda boring,"This book fell short of my expectations. I thought there was going to be more about her relationship with the infamous harlem hustler Nicky Barnes, but it wasnt. Margo talked more about his/her upbringing. overall it was a boring book. I almost lost interest."
4,Elmo's Monster Truck,Seems to be ok. The kids were getting a kick out of it. Only time will tell of it's durability.
3,Its OK,"For the price its Ok ,not great. It wont drive a 2"" staple ,but it does work. If you are looking for something ""heavy duty"" keep looking."
4,Good Buy,"Have installed about 20 sheets of osb with gun thusfar. No problems good quality and easy to load and use. However, would be nice if gun came with case."
4,Consumate capenter,Love this DeWalt medium crown stapler. It takes most of the work out of work and lets me get twice as much done in half the time. Good construction and quality and trouble free service.
2,"Dewalt makes good tools, but not pneumatic tools","I have both 18ga brad nailer and this 16ga stapler. They all have same problem. The safety nose piece gets stuck and not releasing on it's own. You have to pull the trigger to release. By doing so, you lose momentum on your speedy process. They say you can shoot this thing 3 shots per second. I don't think I can do it that fast. Frustration goes all the way. Dewalt makes good cordless nailers, but not pneumatic nailers. If you are a pro, use Hitachi."
1,Charged restock for return,"I had to return product because I purchased it for Father's day and it turned out to be the wrong one my husband wanted. Anyway, they did charge me a restocking fee which was frustrating cause I literally didn't even open the box or anything. It was returned to them within 1 week of purchase too...trying to make money I guess. Had to put a star because they need it but the product was never used so I don't know how the it worked."
1,"horrifically bland, boring story","I like some of Self's work but this one is unreadable...rambling plot, wooden contrived scenes and dialogue, endless repetition of phrases. UG, spend more time on the next one and reclaim your original talent that was found in ""My Idea of Fun."""
3,I didn't like this as much as I wanted to.,"When I ordered this book I was really looking forward to it. I have enjoyed quite a few of Will Self's other books but, I was disappointed. Self's writing is still clever, his characterizations of bitter old queens is fabulous, the setting was very good. His placement of the story at the dawn of the AIDS era was very smart, however the book itself falls flat. There are bright spots here and there, but the story as a whole seems lackluster.I feel the ending was a bit of overkill and entirely unecessary. All in all despite Will Self's wit, I don't really recommend this particular book."
4,Confusing,"This novel is at best confusing but still intriguing. Most of the time you aren't quite sure what is happening, since the book has a tendency to jump around a bit. But what I had loved it for was that it had captured the decandency of the original. Also was quite surprised too that Lord Henry Wotton was a bigger villain in this piece than the original. I loved the surprise ending."
5,Brilliant,"Other reviewers' complaints about this novel typically focus on what is graphically unpleasant about Self's depictions of his characters. Well, wake up. It isn't 1959 anymore, when this complaint was raised about William Burroughs's novel Naked Lunch. Will Self has created an extraordinarily inventive, imaginative rewriting of Wilde's novel, set in the 1980s and '90s. Only a writer as talented as Will Self could have achieved this re-vision so successfully. The novel is filled with brilliant one-liners, and the plot and characters have also been brilliantly re-imagined. Anyone who is bored by the tiresome ""cleverness"" of contemporary gay American fiction, with its endless pseudo-dilemmas (how is the protagonist supposed to choose between the cute do-gooder and the devilishly handsome studster who keeps tempting him?) will be grateful to be able to read a novel in which plot, character, and style actually conspire together to create something truly thoughtful and lasting."
2,Song -CD's: MayB,"I purchased these to download church sermons I found on facebk. The tapes are only 74mins. So, they will not allow me to put one sermon on a CD. I should have paid more attention to the re-cording size instead of the price and qty. The one I did record on sounded fine but I kept the cd on repeat and it began to sound scratchy. I took it out at that point. These are not for me but if someone just wants a lot of cds with music they might work out ok."
3,Capacity issue,"Perhaps, it's just me, but I thought all these CDs were a standard size so I could make a copy from another CD pretty easily...except this product is 650 MB and most other CDs are 700 MBs, so one cannot make an exact copy of another CD."
2,"OK book, great pics, little new information","This book reads well, but is more aimed toward the casual observer, not for mountaineers. Ed has done Everest many times without oxyygen as a guide too."
5,Beautiful,"After readingNo Shortcuts to the Top: Climbing the World's 14 Highest PeaksI had to own this copy of wonderful photography that illustrated the journey! The pictures are not taken by a professional photographer. If you want the highest quality pictures in the world of these mountain ranges this book may not be for you. If you want to see and hear about these peaks from someone who has scaled them all, this is for you."
2,Disjointed and Disappointing,"Hoo boy, Ron Fricke is sorely missed in this second installment of the Qatsi trilogy. I found the film lacking the visual sweep, thematic unity, and relentless momentum of Koyaan. If the mine worker in the first scene hadn't accidentally had a rock dropped on his head, I don't know how Reggio would have had any material at all with which to glue this effort together. Hopefully Naqoy will pull the set up from this artistic low point. Skip Powaq and check out Ron Fricke's Baraka instead -- a much more cohesive and visually compelling tour of third world locations and cultures, though only occasionally touching on the emergent industrialization theme."
3,I M H O,"This movie drags on and on...it is has some striking scenery in the beginning and you oooh and ahhh for the first 15 minutes, but then it just drags out until I finally turned it off...Boring! I can see what point they were trying to make, but they took too long to make it. Everything could have surmised in a nice, short 30 minute version...Don't waste your time..."
4,Visual and Sonic Masterpiece,"Another amazing film by Geoffrey Reggio, following up on the wonderful Koyaanisqatsi. While K was mostly landscapes, P has more shots of people. Both are essentially music videos: pictures and sound with no story. Both, however, do have a message about the qualities of modern life and some of its destructive potential. Score by Philip Glass is more world music than previous Glass scores, and has the same driving and evocative power that his score for K has. This film is visually stunning and like K should be seen on a large screen if possible, but still is powerful even on the smaller screen."
3,Weak film -- great soundtrack,"Koyaanisqatsi is one of my favorite films of all time, so of course I was excited to see this. Major letdown - while Koyaanisqatsi drew its strength from the expert editing that builds to a fevered pitch at the end, this film is more like watching someone flip through the pages of National Geographic, it never strays from its laconic pace. Its politics are questionable as well -- indigenous cultures are glorified and the first world is damned; we never get to see such 'picturesque' scenes of the third world as the Sudanese slave trade or petty criminals having their limbs chopped off in Saudi Arabia.My advice -- buy the Koy/Pow 2-pack at a very reasonable price, then you can at least enjoy the gorgeous and stirring Pow soundtrack in DVD 5.1 audio."
5,Different but Enjoyable,"This isn't your typical movie. No words spoken, yet it conveys a powerful message with the pictures and music. Everyone should see this movie and get a different view of the world we live in. Highly recommended."
3,A Journey to an Indeterminate Place,"If this is about life in transformation, I was too dense to understand the end result of the transformative process.I resonated with and love the the first movie. I ""got it."" However, except for the imagery of the gutted building near the beginning of this installment, nothing here moved me anywhere near as much.We're urged to see the films in order, and then urged further to keep them aesthetically separate in evaluation. I guess that's a good program, but it's awfully hard not to think about the first movie while viewing this one, and wondering if the unused footage from movie no. 1 was the basis for this one."
5,Phenomenal Integration of Sight and Sound,"This is the second in the ""Qatsi"" trilogy presented by director Godfrey Reggio and composer Philip Glass (plus many other gifted persons). It can stand alone as a fantastic sight and sound metaphor on the progress (or rather regress) of the ""Southern Peoples"" of the planet as the values of the ""Western/Northern Peoples"" infiltrate in virus-like manner to depersonify and disenfranchise people from their cultural roots. It is an apt sequel to Koyaanisqatsi and precursor to the third and final film Naaqatsi (sp?), the sight and sound metaphor of how humanity has become so engrossed in and dependent on technology, it is impossible to distinguish where one ends and the other begins. All three movies require a prerequisite mindset of patience. For those who need dialogue, plot and certain resolution, these are not the movies for you. But for the persevering, these are visionary and captivating, if not prophetic of the age in which we have found ourselves."
4,Splendid visuals,"Taking a friends advice I broadened my horizons beyond Koyaanisqatsi, which I liked. This film is a great take on moral issues entirely different and was well done. I may have liked Koyaanisqatsi's music more, but this has an appeal of its own to it."
4,A strong author with practical advice.,"The best reason to get this book is that the author has great credentials. He has drafted at the state and city level for over 30 years. That kind of experience, when combined with a commitment to plain language, makes for a valuable and authoritative text. And the book is, indeed, clearly written and thorough. The only drawback is the format--it's somewhat clunky, archaic, and slightly unprofessional in appearance. But if you need guidance on drafting rules and legislation, this is an excellent book that focuses on those skills."
1,Too simplistic,"This is another example of a person who has no experience drafting legislation presuming to tell the professionals who do that kind of writing how to perform their difficult task. Most such intruders into the field, including Martineau, base their recommendations on Plain Language principles. Martineau clearly reveals his lack of knowledge of statutory drafting and the havoc that is caused by mechanistically applying the allegedly universal but actually simplistic and counter-productive princples of Plain Language to this form of writing. If you are looking for useful advice about drafting, read something by a professional who has thought about the subject."
1,Doesn't work with Apple mighty mouse,"I was initially happy when I started using this mouse pad because it's paper thin and totally smooth. I thought I was going to love it. However I soon discovered that it does not work with the Apple mighty mouse. Something about the surface of the mouse pad caused the mighty mouse laser to randomly shoot my cursor to the corners of my screen. If you're like me and like to use hot corners, this quickly becomes a nuisance. At times it wasn't frequent but at its worst it was probably happening several times an hour. I soon gave up on the mouse pad and went back to just using the surface of my desk."
3,A nice mousepad,"It is really thin, something I really like. But is not the sticky stay-in-place mouse pad I expected. The picture is really nice, and that is pretty much the point."
3,Passable,"Exactly as described, the bottom is a bit slick on the desk, so the pad slides around a bit. Could use a better rubberized grip surface, but overall okay for the price."
2,Not as shown and described,"The mouse pad was thin, like paper thin and even though was advertised as non- skid, slid all over my desk. Also made an audible noise whenever I moved the mouse. Not worth the money."
3,"Looks cool, but it slides around too much","I've had this mousepad for a few years, and it worked okay when I tucked it under the edge of my laptop to keep it from sliding around. However, I just bought a desktop and when I tried using this mousepad with it, there was nowhere to put it to keep it from sliding. I'm not using a mousepad at all now because this one slides so much, it eliminates the point of a mousepad. I'm looking for a new one."
2,Doesn't stay put,"Unlike a typical mouse pad, this has no padding to it at all. It's just a thin plastic sheet; it's almost as if there were no mouse pad at all, but it's thick enough that it still catches the mouse if I go over the edge.It also ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT STAY PUT. It slid all over the desk and I was constantly having to reposition it. I finally covered the back with double-sided tape and it hasn't moved since."
2,Not as shown,I have to say I was not happy with this purchase. The mouse pad is paper thin & the mouse keeps getting stuck on the edges. The picture is beautiful but it's not your normal mouse pad.
2,Didn't stay put,"This pad didn't stay in one place on my desk surface, it slid around. I had to keep repositioning it next to my keyboard. I ended up using it with my old computer where it is held in place by the edge of the counter. It is pretty, though."
2,thin plastic pad,I was a little disappointed with the mouse pad because it is plastic but it has a great picture on it. If you are buying it for looks get it but for use you will be disappointed.
2,See below,"Wish it was thicker, it is plastic and paper thin. Wireless mouse does not work well at all. Was disappointed"
2,nice pattern,"Love the pattern, but the mouse pad doesn't stay put.It is thin and not cushiony. I don't love it."
3,Ok,I thought this was going to be thicker but it turned out to be a thin sheet of laminate! The mouse works on it but the quality isn't there.
5,"Works great and is a ""work of art""","This is my second one, first one is now at a relatives house. I've read earlier reviews of this mouse pad sliding around, being flimsy and not like other mousepads. Keep in mind this is intended (except the sliding around part). I love the thin design, if I roll off it with the mouse no biggie I just roll right back on, not like on thicker mouse pads where you need to lift the mouse back up onto the pad. I also enjoy the thinner aspect because my wrist sits in a more comfortable position. As for the sliding around part I don't have that issue, though I imagine that is enirely the result of the surface the pad is sitting on. I have a wooden desk with a protective coating. This coating seems to help it stay right in place."
3,a little regret,"it's beautiful design and light and easy to carry,but it is slippery, and only mouses with pretty precise locating can fit on it"
3,More of a curiosity than a masterwork,"The symphony is a rather traditional four-movement work. Labeled as three movements, the middle movement is really two--a fast and a slow inner movement. While the harmonies aren't overly dissonant, they are rich and they support some beautiful melodies and straightforward rhythms. Some of the development sections seem a little wayward and Mr. Guridi seems to have mistaken plainness for stylistic unity. Nothing here will jump out as exciting and the handling of orchestral timbres is a trifle uninteresting.The Bilbao Symphony is featured here, led by Juan Jose Mena, and they create a polish to the sound that highlights the work's tunefulness at the expense of shining a spotlight on the frumpy soundscape. I'd be happy to hear more from this band. The disk closes with a dance excerpt from Guridi's ballet, Amaya, and the orchestra sounds like it's having a bunch of fun."
3,Good,Not what I typically read but it was good and interesting nonetheless. A few things seemed unreal but alot of it was true to facts.
2,a book of patience and motivation,lucy the giant was the kind of book that you really have to read strait through because once you put it down you dont have much motivation to finish it. if you have patience you might find the book interesting but if you dont i do not recomend reading it because it takes awhile to get into it and if u do get into it most likely you will be falling asleep agin by the next page.Hannah N.
3,LEARN THE FACTS,lucy the gient is a great book if you like crapy endings. i loved the book and its plot but the ather clearly did not do her reserch on runiwhay cases she was off the point and far from the truth. in reality lucy would not haft to werey about her dad becas of what she did she would be put in to a groop home of foster care because her dad would have been dubed unfit parent by us law. all in all the book would have been much better if the ather hzd tacen the time to do her home work a litel beter what a lot better. NAN G
2,"Books like ""Lucy The Giant""","Books like ""lucy the Giant"" Barely any action. I mean Lucy the giant really has some action but me personally I do not like the book. It is not like other books I have read. That is basically why I disliked the book. I like drama, action, mystery, and that is about it. If you wanted to read the book again, then you absolutely different from myself. Well, the story is basically like real life. And I like a little more fantasy in a book. I guess that is all I can write and say.By: Michelle N."
4,Lucy the Giant,"its a good book, it shows that anyone can have a life even tho they might not have the best life.Its shows that people can have love from other people.Its brings oy amd laughter. A adventerous and couragous story. A girl who isnt afraid to be herself when she is around other people. Atrust worthy friend and a good book to read in the free time."
3,The author's best book,"Maybe it is a bit evil to suggest that a book written in 1990 (note that amazon's blurb is not correct) is the author's best book, but that is my firm opinion. This is partly because authors used to write fewer books and thus have more content to write about.The book is really a selected summary of Porter'sCompetitive StrategyandCompetitive Advantage, but with a stronger marketing focus. In 1990, this was a four star book, because it was a good restatement with a slightly different perspective. However, writing in 2012 this book is only relevant for a small niche audience; academics interested in the field of strategic management as it was practised some 20 years ago. If you belong to this group you might get some useful bits of information from this book. If you are a practitioner you would still find value in the book, but it does not make full sense for you to pick up a book that is 22 years old. Three stars."
3,Good but not up to date,"Overall the book does a good job of detailing the strategy process for a market driven economy. All relevant aspects are covered in adequate depth. However, I kept thinking that the book was dated especially with regard its examples of corporate behavior. I tried to push these thoughts to the back of my mind by reassuring myself of the 1999 copyright. In reality, the 1999 copyright comes from the addition of a new introduction to the 1990 text. I was very disappointed when I realized this. Although it is presents a good framework, it is dated. This is ironic given the fact that the author presents examples of dated thinkings of strategy and shows how to improve. He needs to take the time to improve his own thinkings. In a market driven economy, strategy changes QUICKLY over 10 years. You don't need this book to know that."
4,good movie,this was a really good movie. It is a thriller but not horror as so many are combined to be. I think its worth at least one watch but I have watched it several times and enjoyed each time.
2,Could be much more better...,"Though I'm a huge fan of Ray Liotta buying this DVD was a mistake. Just rent it.. there is nothing extraordinary in this movie to watch over and over again.As to the movie itself. The idea is not new but still has a lot of potential. Unfortunately writers of the script did a very poor job in everything.. dialogues, characters development and plot twists that are really idiotic.Liotta and Dafoe are trying deliver some acting but horrible plot leaves completely disappointing feeling."
2,Disappointing - with end notes,"I suppose there are some researchers who will find this book valuable. I was not one. I did not find anything in this work that wasn't already covered elsewhere more lucidly. But this book, at 322 pages, included a 68-page bibliography and another 30 pages of indexes. That's a third of the book. Then there are the footnotes. The text to the first chapter was 21 pages long, followed by another 25 (!) pages of footnotes (149 of them!) in tiny font. Several of the end notes filled nearly an entire page of print. And the rest of the chapters were also like this."
5,grand view,"This is a little gem of a book. All coloured plates of illuminated manuscripts, and a wide selection of masters. There is not a lot of information, but if you are looking for good reproductions of manuscripts, this is one of the best."
2,Doesn't quite fit the bill,"This sounded like an excellent value. Might be good for light duty but the cord ends up being just too short for our larger room needs, If doing much vacuuming you're frequently emtying the container, and worst, we've found that it won't run more than 10-30 minutes without quitting, I presume because of overheating. It is so close, yet too far away to being really good. You might want to stay away from this one unless you intend very light duty."
3,Get what you pay for,"Bought the vacuum for it's low price, small size and being bagless. It works just OK.It overheats quickly, so it is best to use it quickly and turn it off during any pause in cleaning.After about 3-4 uses, emptying the dust and shaking out the filter after each use and washing the filter once, the filter seems to have degraded permanently. Now suction starts out just adequately and weakens fairly quickly. Blowing out the filter with the vacuum exhaust helped a little.Removing the dust bin from the unit is easy, but then the filter assembly has to be coaxed out of the bubble shaped bin leaving two messy things to hold, neither of which can be cleaned well without setting the other down. I usually try to do it outside or in the sink.Overall, I guess I got what I paid for. I like that it fits in a very small space."
3,A Matter of Taste but Satisfactory,"This is a satisfactory set, surely welcome as a Christmas stocking stuffer, but a bit disappointing. It certainly lives up to the Cross reputation for quality. However, I seldom use the pencil and the pen is a ballpoint and not the selectip I prefer. The Classic Century is also rather slim and the thicker, more substantial Classic Century II feels more comfortable in the old hand. If one does a great deal of writing, the refills can become an unwelcome added expense. Overall, a good pen that writes smoothly and an interesting addition to anyone's collection, but not quite my cup of tea."
3,Could Be Better...,"Don't like the magnetic power cord connection (comes off too easily and is probably a safety hazard when it does), and a hinged lid would be a much better design. Also the timer doesn't work very well, seems to get stuck and never goes off, especially when set to short cooking times.But it is roomy and gets hotter than most fryers I have used. Just make sure you don't bump the cord and use an external timer."
5,I call My new Lung Tina,"On a scale of 1-10, ten being the highest. I would rate this as a 10.thank you"
5,No Doubt the Best Baseball Movie Ever Made,"61* was an awesome baseball movie. It is enjoyable for everyone, not just for baseball fans. I first saw this movie when it premiered on HBO. I watched it over and over. 61* is not just about a homerun race between Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris, but it's also about the problems they faced while trying to break the Babe's record. The movie is a drama and a comedy. It's even emotional in a way. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good baseball movie and also anyone who just wants to see a good movie and I gurantee you'll watch it over and over."
4,Surprising good look at two of the best.,"I grew up watching Micky and Roger. This movie was made with love and they all did a great job.I am the same age as Billy Crystal, but a Cardinal fan. I was 14 years in 1961 and the race for the Babes record was all we talked about for months. I, like most was rooting for the Mick. I couldn't believe the boos that Maris got though. Roger had played his AAA ball in the American Association. As such, he came and played in Omaha. He was one minor lead player that didn't mind signing authographs.I cried when roger died. I cried when the Mick died. This movie was a real emotional experience for me. Probably only 3 stars for most people, you sort of had to be there to give it 4."
3,Nice bit of Baseball,Not bad considering it's the Yankees..... but I digress. Good acting and special effects. I also recommend it for the additional Billy Crystal material.
5,It Works,I'm not a huge baseball fan....and further more I hate the Yankess. But I would say that this is one of the best sports films ever made. It captures the true nature of the game and sport in general.
5,A piece of Detroit History,"'61 -- a Billy Crystal made for T.V. movie, about the homerun race between Maris and Mantle, filmed in Tiger Stadium inDetroit, MI. My husband and I were married that year and wanted to give this movie to each of our four children as a memory of the stadium and also some insight into what what was happening in the world of baseball the year their parents' married. DVD's arrived in perfect condition, within a few days of purchase. They are already in tucked safely in stockings, waiting for Christmas Eve."
4,"The M&M Race for the Babe's Single Season Record, SUBERB MOVIE!","The Greatest race between two baseball players is told with the direction of big Yankees fan Billy Crystal & suberb performaces from Thomas Jane as #7 Mickey Mantle & Barry Pepper as #9 Roger Maris in the Yankee's 1961 season as the two marvels race to beat Babe Ruth's 1927 single season record of 60 homers. It's a suberb, enthralling, entertaining movie of America's past Time, It's a grand slam triumph & one of most accurate baseball movies ever made. If you liked ""Field of Dreams"" & ""the Natural"" witness baseball history at it's finest in the movies with ""61*"" ""ROGER!"" ""ROGER!"""
4,Baseball's Glory Days,"As I was 20 in 1961, and a Mickey Mantle fan,the film brought back a lot memories. Those were Baseball's glory days. It been going downhill ever since. I live near Chicago, and I wasn't aware of the extent of N.Y. bias against Roger."
4,Billy Crystal's direction shines!,61* is the story of Roger Maris and Mickey Mantles's quest to top Babe Ruth's 60 home run record in 1961. The casting is perfect and the historical accuracy including the color of the Yankee Stadium seats seems spot on. If you're a baseball fan you'll enjoy it and even if you're not you'll like time travel back 50 years ago. this movie is a lot better than you think it would be.
5,great movie and in great shape,"I love this movie. It is the true story of the M&M boys. I received it within a week of placing my order and it was in mint condition (it was advertized as new, so it should have been).Real cheap price too. I will be buying a lot more from this seller."
5,"great drama, great actors, great story","As a big Barry Pepper fan I found another proof for him being such an amazing actor. But it is not just about him, this is a moving interesting tale of 1960s NY baseball, told with great love for the game and its players. And I don't even like baseball!"
5,"Great movie, gives you an inside look at Maris and Mantle","I love baseball movies. But some are better than others. And this one is near the top. It depicts the home run race between Micky Mantle and Roger Maris, who at times were rivals but were also great friends, with a love and respect for each other.It really brought the history of the game to the forefront for me, as I did not realize the fans were so against Maris breaking Babe Ruth's record. The fact that the record stood all these years with an asterix behind it, was unfair to Maris because his accomplishment was astounding and took many years to be matched.Billy Crystal brought the story forward to when Maris's record was broken, with actual footage of the Maris family. This was a wonderful way to weave the past with the present, as Crystal was recapturing the excitement and joy of both records being reached. This movie is a 5 star bet, so grab your cracker jacks and head to the ball game, because you won't be disappointed."
5,Perfect Gift For My Dad!,I got this movie for my father. He turned 61 this year and is a huge Bronx Bombers' fan and his favorite player is Roger Maris.
1,Big Disappointment...,"I thought that this would be a typical travel documentary, and found myself very disappointed. I bought it to show my high school geography class, and felt it was a waste of money at the price offered. The film is roughly thirty minutes, and the rest of the DVD is music tracks or video of various Sonic Wave groups (typically with just a still shot). The only redeeming feature of the DVD is the fact that I can show a semi-decent music video of a group that most of the class has never heard of..."
3,Works with Windows 7,I was trying to get a program that I could use with Windows 7. When I upgraded to 7 from vista I was not able to use my older forms program. I finally hit on this and it did work. It works for me but if you had to use it everyday it could be kind of a pain. I have not figured out how to just open a prepared form and start working. I have to open the design tool then go to filler each time. Calculation boxes are somewhat difficult to understand but if really read instruction you will get there. It does make a nice form when you are done.
1,Absolute waste of your money.,I would have to agree with the other two reviews that are currently up on this product. I purchased this software of it's false and misleading statements of how easy it is and all the preloaded templates. Aside from what the other two have said; I have yet to find any templates at all in this program. I ran into the same problem they did when it came to any form of tech support. All this company wants and cares about is your money. I will never buy anything ever again from this company and I strongly discourage anyone else from making the same mistake that I did. *(BUYER BEWARE)*

5,Great Reading,"Diagnosis Evil is a very eye opening book. As an educator it really expalins a lot of ""missing links"" that aren't usually explained in the usual educational psychology courses. It equips one with different insights than one may have not approached previously. It was excellently written and edited for even the lay person to understand and enjoy reading. I would highly recommend it to any one in the Psychology field or any profession that deals with people, eg. teachers, pastors, counselors, or any field involving interpersonal relations.-Mrs. Margie Asher, Christian Elementary Teacher"
4,adidas Trussi Short,"Can you say thin? This material is thin. These are great for lounging or whatnot, but not jogging. They also attract static cling more than my other workout apparel, so I tend to use them for housework, lounge wear uses. Durable and long lasting though. Had these for years and they still look new."
4,Good workout shorts,"The material is thin, but it's breathable and comfortable. It's versatile in the gym it keeps me cool while doing cardio and doesn't bunch while I'm on weights. Def, true to size. I ordered two small, one black and one red."
3,These shorts are smaller than other Adidas size small shorts,I had to return these shorts because they run a little smaller than the Adidas small shorts that I have purchased and worn in the past. They are smaller than the Girls size XL that I bought at the same time!
2,Not Worth The Money,"Half of them I had to throw out as they did not record over, so I choose a different brand and have no problem, but these ones, don't waste your money."
2,I agree,"I agree with the other reviewer - after a couple of recordings, these discs develop defects and will not play. Most of them had to be discarded after recording two or three times. Big disappointment."
1,Mutant League Failure,"Open Your eyes. It's just of bunch of the first epsoiodes taped together. It's not like a whole new movie with a whole new story. Full House did that many years ago. The C.G.I in this ""Movie"" is horrible and just as bad as the C.G.I from the first spiderman film. Granted it's still gorey as the games but this was a saturday moring kids show and this might scar them for life. Infact some of the images are too scary for some kids. Overall,Never buy it. I give this ""movie"" a 0 out of 10."
3,"Decent Film, Horrible acting!!","I fond the The Ledge to be slightly above average. Good story line with an ending you dont see every day. I cant get over how bad of an actress Liv Tyler is and how she continues to find work. On the flip side, the only good acting comes from Terrence Howard. I dont understand why is not in more films. Maybe he should hire Liv Tyler's agent. All in all a pretty decent movie that keeps your attention until the very end."
3,Better actors needed but an intriguing story,"I didn't think the main actors did very well here except for the one playing Joe and the cop played by Terrence Howard. However, the plot is intriguing and may not have been done before, at least not like this. Four people come together over issues of adultery, faith, emotional blackmail, a hostage, and a question of fatherhood. Some very emotional scenes, including some regarding issues of believing or not believing in a God."
3,The Ledge,"I had to see this flim because it starred Terrance Howard, one of my favorites. It was a very good film. But let me tell you keep you hankie nearby because you are going to do a bit of crying. Good film."
2,Interesting christian/atheist dilemna,Its a very predictable film with a wrong ending. There is much dialogue showing the dangers of the christian faith and the dangers of dying for your beliefs. The poor ending certainly damaged the film greatly when it was not necessary. In the end everyone lost so there was no feel good factor after. One that christians will hate and the rest will watch and forget. Such a pity as with a little thought this could have been a exciting film.
5,Great movie a must watch.,One of the few movies that is not predictable. It keeps you on your toes. The actors are all great and top notch.
4,only set with a plane (pull) tug,"My son is two and consumed with all types of vehicles and machinery. The airport is the ultimate fascination. We fly to visit family and to take most vacations. Southwest has been our primary airline and he recognizes it easily. However he wanted the particular vehicle that pushed the airplane back from the gate. The pull tug or plane tug. After searching a few hours on the internet and eliminating life size equipment, this plane set was the only set that had a plane tug. You may not be able to tell in the packaging...it is not listed well. after receiving it and opening the set, there is a plane tug!"
1,Cheap plastic junk,"Eleven dollars of instant misery for our three year old. Wings are constructed of weak plastic that broke within 20 minutes of use. ""Paint"" is actually cheap decals that will peel off in no time. A disappointment because we assumed a ""die cast"" plane would be like every other die cast plane we've seen in our life -- i.e. made of metal. This is a plastic plane with a bit of metal."
2,Not so good,The finishing touches on the plane is poor and unacceptable. The plastic decorative cover peels very easily and is not safe for small kids.
2,Cheap and flimsy,"This set isn't terrible (my son loves it) but after 1 day, most of his comments were ""Daddy fix it?"" to which I reply ""I'm sorry, son, I can't and the cost of shipping this back to China for warranty service is prohibitive.""He enjoys the toys, so I won't return them, but I would not buy again."
3,No tug car,"I ordered this set because of the tug car but it seems newer sets have no tug cars. It was only the airplane, a bus and a catering truck."
3,"Ok for play, not for looks","This toy is a fairly good one. The stickers basically ruin the appeance of the 737, ant the ones on the bus look even worse. The vehicles are not to scale, niether are the signs. definetly don't buy for anyone 7+ because they will be dissapointed. Under 7, they will be perfectly happy."
5,Great Joy,"I got this for my grandson and he is enjoying it a lot. He had one like it that I had purchased at the airport, but an other boy broke it and he was very upset. I bought this to make up for his loss and he was delighted. Thank you."
2,the decals aren't put on very well,"I purchased this item at a local airport because I am very in to airplanes. I released when I opened the product that the decals were very sloppily put on, with air bubbles and rips. I tried to fix an air bubble on the tail and the decal ripped. I will never buy one of these items again!"
3,"my son loved it, but broke it a few hours later","My son was so excited to get a Southwest Airplane, we always fly that airline so he's obsessed with it, plus we live by an airport. He carried it with him all day and even napped with it, by late evening he dropped it and boom it broke. My husband has tried wood glue, and super glue and nothing will hold one of the tail wings together, my son is so sad now since the gift came from Santa. Although he loved it, it was very cheaply made, or just not made for kids. we'll probably have to buy him a new one since he can't wait til next christmas, and I'm sure it'll be a waste of money because it'll break again at some point."
4,Pelican Xbox 360 Fan Stand,I have owned this for over a week and let me just say that it was a worthy investment. It cools the temperature of the 360 even when it is off. The usb connecter allows me to connect my mp3 player that would not fit before. The only complaint I have is that it does not turn on or off automatically.
4,Only one problem,"This is a good product but only if you conect it to a outside sourse of energy besides the xbox 360. What I did was got a female to male usb cord and plug it into that and then into an apple ipod brick. The porblem with running of the xbox 360 is you are just heating it more and then trying to cool it down so it cancels out. As for being vertical, if you dont move it around or to the horizontal postion while it is on or with a disc in, there should be no problem. The apple ipod brick does cost a little extra but is worth saving the 400$ 360. A self powered usb hub (plugs into the wall) would also work and might cost less plus you get more usb ports. The picture with the nyko intercooler and pelican fan stand is stupid becuase you are just making the 360 work more, take the nyko off."
3,Good But Bad,The product is effective although it would of been nice to know that it has an on and off switch in the back of the stand and that the stand must be switched on only during game play which i must say is abit annoying!!
1,This sucks,"This says its makes it more stable but i don't see how, it rases it higher and if you tap the very top of the xbox 360 the unit will wobble slightly if not on a rock hard table the xbox 360 will fall over. My unit fell and broke the face plate. Im gratefull the unit still runs or i would be sueing the maker. (if there is a game in your unit when it falls the game is destoryed)"
4,Excellent book for beginners,"This book was just what I needed to learn basic knitting techniques. The pictures are great and the descriptions are easy to follow.I agree with other reviewers about the unappealing projects, however, the projects seemed unappealing because of the yarns used. They seemed a bit 80's-ish. If you cruise the internet for tips on substituting yarn, you can substitue prettier yarn for the projects.I highly recommend this book to any beginning knitter who needs visuals to learn. This book is worth your money, in my opinion."
5,Classic Bangles,"The Bangles return with an album and single that are of a piece with their 1980s music. ""Something That You Said"", the lead single from their album ""Doll Revolution"", is a quiet ballad in some ways similar to ""Eternal Flame"" but without the big production ending. Susannah Hoffs has never sounded more affecting than on the chorus, when she soars on the lines, ""Something that you said turned me from the inside out / Running through my head, something I have dreamed about."" The Bangles have grown and matured both as songwriters and performers, so this tune benefits from their time off. The single is one of their best songs, in my opinion, and the whole CD is equally good. I highly recommend it."
1,Not comparable to Bill Phillips.... at all.,"I haven't read Dr. Peeke's book, but I have read and followed Bill Phillips Body For Life. I bought the DVD to supplement routines at home on days I could not get to the gym. So that I could have video to follow and motivation at home to exercise for ""Body For Life"" The exercises on this DVD are not even comparable to the exercise routine in the original Body For Life book or plan. There are 3 ten-minute workouts. 10 minutes for upper body, 10 minutes for lower body and abs, and a 10-minute cardio routine. That's it. If you are serious about transformation, I would recommend sticking with the original. Very disappointed with Dr. Peeke's version of Body For Life. Not sure how it could even legal to insinuate a resemblance to the original. But that's just my opinion."
4,Book comparison,"The video is good. However, I was surprised that the DVD did not relate too closely to the book (Body for life for women)by Dr. Peeke. Still the workouts were good."
4,Just another exercise book,This book didn't really tell me any more that any other exercise and health book. It is nice that it came with a workout cd too. I watched the workout but have not done it. It did not seem like anything special at all. There are certainly much better exercise cds out there.
4,bloodrayne....good for anger management.,"I don't have my own copy of the game yet, but I played it on a friends computer and I must say that bloorayne 2 is much better than the first. I won't go into details with this becausebloodrayne 2 is very simlar to the PS2 and x-box version.Besides the bloodsucking and the killer combos and puzzles, what I love the most is that you can trash the enviroment to pieces. Feeling angry and frastrated after a hard day? Trash that 1,000 dollar grand piano. Destroy the flat HD t.v. I onlygot through the first stage but I like what I see so far.The only faults I find with this game is that the bad guys seema bit repeative, and all you have to do is harpoon them to death some times. Also, even though you can preset the controls yourself, sometimes play control on a keyboard is a little bit arkward at times espeically when u r trying the killer combos. This is when using a game controller for a pc comes in handy.Other than that this is a great game."
3,console game,"Either my tastes changed since when I played the first part, or the game was thoroughly console-ized. I remember an awesome gore and action game, and all I got here was bunch of pole jumping and boring linear fights; stopped playing after yet another jump-20-poles-without-saving frustration. Boss fights also boring as all hell."
2,BORING GAME,I could only play a few minutes of this game...just too boring.Too much of the samething over and over.
4,Very well researched,"This book is a carefully constructed work of reference dealing with some of the seminal pieces in contemporary Indian art. It features monographs and essays by some of India's leading artists who have built a reputation for Indian art in the international scene. Each of these artists walks the reader through the evolution of the human form in Indian art using key works of reference that the international community might not really be familiar with yet. With the resounding success of recent auctions of Indian art in the UK and US by Sotheby's and Christie's, this book will be of immense value to the collector community looking to gain insights into the contextual dimensions that have given rise to the unique interpretations of the figurative form in Indian art. Enjoyable historical perspective, certainly worth the price for a good work of reference value. Illustrations and reproduction are top draw, high quality."
4,First Hollywood book I ever read,"Lynda Obst uses her experience as an accomplished film producer to explain to new people how to make it in Hollywood. She hits every topic right on the head. I have experienced the same things in getting my films made, particularly The Indie Pendant. All of her info can used by anyone wanting to become a filmmaker. The chapter on figuring out which way the horse is headed was probably the best chapter I have ever read on getting things done in Hollywood. Look for all of this info and more during The Indie Film Hour on World Talk Radio. Hosted by myself. www.vdefilms.com"
4,"Learn to manuver like Obst, and world will be yours.","I bought the book to learn how Hollywood works. But I learned more than I bargained for. Obst gives a practical guide for dealing with the most nasty, egomaniacal, bitchy, insecure fools on the planet. If we treat everyone with as much undue respect and courtesy as Obst, we will surely succeed at whatever we pursue. Seriously.Good luck, Lynda, and thanks for the advice."
1,She's no David O. Selznick!,"Lynda Obst seems to think she deserves laurels merely for navigating the shoals of the Hollywood swamp. Certainly it has made her rich and successful. And, undoubtedly, there is a place for gamesmanship - but watch out when it becomes the be-all and the end-all. All the greats, Selznick, Thalberg, Samuel Goldwyn, Daryl Zanuck - they knew the business inside out, every aspect of filmmaking - and they left a legacy of great pictures. What will Obst bequeath to the world? ""Bad Girls""?You'd be far better off reading one of the many excellent (recent) bios of such greats as Billy Wilder, William Wyler, John Ford, David Lean and others. They give you a greater sense of why filmmaking is such an important force at the end of the millenium."
3,Flawed but Important,"Anyone not new to or about to enter the industrial bone-crusher of Hollywood should probably take a pass on this book. But anyone looking to make Hollywood a career that hasn't grown up with or in the business needs all the help possible, and this book is a must for anyone in that category.Mind you, it's not the first or last word on building a career in film. What Obst does is tell her story and at the same time attempt to impart what wisdom she picked up along the way.Think of it as a long lunch at The Ivy listening to someone who has been there and done that, and you will find Hello, He Lied as an important, insightful part of your film education."
5,A hit in alternative ed!,"Stop the presses!! Alternative high school students like CHAUCER!! What would have otherwise been a miserable learning (and teaching) experience was a complete blast thanks to this version of The Canterbury Tales. Funny, educational, and relevant---it will change how your students approach the text, especially when combined with the musical version of it. Thanks, Baba Brinkman!"
4,"It's fine, basic, serviceable decaf green tea, neither special or awful","I drink a goodly amount of green tea, so I prefer to get decaf. Ive tried several brands, cheap to higher end, and this one falls in the middlish. I use it almost daily and it's fine for a basic decaf. I like it iced with a twist of lime.Enjoy..."
5,Excellent,I've tried several different brands of Chai tea and found this one to be the best. I love this tea!
2,a bit disappointed...,"I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy."
5,Great Green Tea!,"I drink a ton of green tea and recently purchased this from Amazon. I like to try new green teas every once and a while, but I think I found my new ""everyday"" green tea. I was looking for an organic green tea without all the caffeine (since I drink it so much) and believe this is probably the best green tea I have ever consumed. FYI: I only drink this green tea cold and use 5 or 6 bags to make a gallon. Buy this green tea with confidence if you like to make a pitcher and drink it over a couple days."
1,"Not green, not good","This decaf really disappointed me, esp. given the other glowing reviews. It does not appear green, nor does it taste ""green"" (ie: doesn't have that fresh ""grassy"" flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea). Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste. Yuk. Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one. What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again."
1,MIGHT AS WELL BREW UP DRIED LAWN CLIPPINGS!,"I decided to buy the Stash ORGANIC chamomile tea this time and since I drink a lot of it, I decided to use the ""Subscribe and Save"" feature to save 15% and receive it regularly. IT IS TASTELESS! Hope Amazon will give me a refund. If not, I am stuck with 6 boxes that will end up in the green waste bin. Cancelled the ""Subscribe and Save"" feature. Calling Amazon for a refund right now."
4,Good tea for the price,"I drink loose-leaf tea while I'm at home, but bags are more convenient when I'm at work, so I drink this. It's not the best green tea I've ever tasted, but it's inexpensive (especially via Subscribe & Save) and has a good brand reputation. If you're a casual fan of green tea, this will do nicely."
5,Great hard to find tea,I love this tea and drink it most mornings. Ginger and lemon are good for digestion and thins mucus plus I get some antiocidants from the green tea.I have trouble finding this tea at the grocery stores and was delighted to find it online.
3,Better than Bigelow's Earl Gray Green,"I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good."
4,Flavorful Tea,"I love green tea, so I am always on the lookout for different varieties. I really like this tea. If you let it steep for a while you get a nice taste of the ginger. This is a great tea to start your morning with or for an afternoon drink."
5,Good to mix with baby formula,"My baby develop terrible gas pains at month 2. I read one of the reviews that it would be good to brew water with the chamomile tea before mixing formula. I followed through, and end up solving my baby's gas problem."
5,Wow!,This is the greeen tea to drink! It doesn't have the bitter after taste that some of the other green teas have and tastes very smooth. I have been drinking 3-4 cups a day for the past couple of weeks and it tastes wonderful either hot or iced. I am now spoiled for any other green teas! The price here with subscribe and save is much less expensive than at the local store.
5,Great product!,"I've tried other green tea brands, such as Bigelow and so far I love STASH. Its taste is wonderful and very natural. I can actually taste the actual green tea. Other reviewer must has left the tea cold, and that's where it turns bitter. So drink it while it's warm <- that's why they called it 'hot tea'."
5,Love this tea!,"I really don't know what to say that hasn't already been said. This tea tastes great! It's decaffeinated through a natural process, it's fair trade, and it's organic! What more could you ask for? My favorite green tea to date!"
3,SeattleLee,"Loved the distinct flavor of Stash Organic Chai Black and Green Tea and, when I could not find it, finally purchased the Earl Grey Black and Green. Found it okay, but nothing unusual or extremely tasty. Will not repurchase and will continue to locally watch for the Organic Chai Black and Green Tea."
5,"Good tasting tea, great value.","I am drinking two cups of this a day. Tastes good. It would be nice if it came without the string and stapple. I like the automatic shipment then I do not run out unexpectedly. My only point of note, would do not over brew it. I have forgotten about my cup waiting for me and the taste gets a little off when it has sat for an hour! My bad really, not the teas problem."
3,no lemon. not much green tea,"If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled ""lemon ginger green tea."" It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag."
1,Wrong shipments,I've ordered the Black Tea twice and received Green Tea both times - I'll try once more.
4,intence creativity,"carcass are very precise live, sounds almost like on their studio recordings. although this dvd is a bit raw in production, it's still worth it. carcass were a one of a kind, definitly a must have."
4,AWESOME LIVE CARCASS !!!,"This dvd has been transfered from a battered VHS tape without any enhancements at all but that doesn't detract from the fun.The 50' 1992 Gods Of Grind Tour is worth the money per se !! Incredibly well filmed and with a terrific stereo mix; guitars SHRED, trebley but totally audible bass guitarwork and inhuman drumming; these guy invented the grindcore genre !!!The shorter Nottingham 1989 bonus gig is a pain to watch and listen after the newer one since the filming and sound are of bootleg quality. Curiously enough the dvd starts off with 5 excellent videoclips 3 of which I didn't care for much since they belong to their latest melodic death metal era which would eventually lead up to their splitting. The other 2 SHRED !!I'm just a casual fan who wanted to check out on the band through this dvd and man was I surprised !!!"
4,Carcass is always carcass,"Carcass is the best metal band.This DVD is not very good though, in the sense that they do not spend any money to making it.Still good if you are carcass fan."
4,The splatter has been immortalized!!,"This video rocks. Especially if you know a group has broken up and gone on to do crappy things, it's nice to have them preserved at their peak of performance for all to enjoy. I like the rock videos and wish I had been able to see them on MTV while i was growing up! But they didn't show such things back then, not even on the earliest version of Headbangers Ball.The live videos included are non-edited video footage of two of their shows in England on the older tours, Symphonies of Sickness and Tools of the Trade (I think). You get the whole live experience without editing! Aweseome shows with the double vocals that are all mangled and evil sounding. I do'nt think metal has been the same since!"
3,crushed ice made simple,"i was glad to find this...wish it worked on a bigger scale, perhaps....but otherwise, fine."
3,disappointed,"Not at all what I expected, very disappointing in song choice and quality of their voices not as robust as other cds by them"
2,very disappointing,"This was ordered as a Verbatim HP C4096A toner for an HP LaserJet printer.I just took it out last week, as I needed it. Neither the box or toner cartridge said verbatim. It had some kind of generic name.But it appeared to be the right size, and it was. But it spewed toner all over the inside of the printer, each page had streaks and printing from the document before. Even cleaning the printer and starting over did no good.I had to go out and buy a real hp toner. it worked perfectly the first time, no smearing or anything (and i hadn't cleaned the printer a second time.)"
5,a must-have anthology,"Itself divided into the sections Foremothers, Self and Identity, Self and Others, Spaces, Myths and Archetypes, Writers on Language and Writing, Growing Up, and Celebrations, this broadly inclusive anthology includes writers who need no introduction to anyone familiar with Chicana literature: Ana Castillo, Sandra Cisneros, Gloria Anzaldua, Lorna Dee Cervantes, Alma Villanueva, Cordelia Candelaria...and if you haven't read their poetry or pose, here's your chance."
1,Waste of money,"I agree with the other reviewers, and have just returned the copy of this 'book' which I ordered. It's not a book at all, just a small collection of poorly photocopied pages, and this should have been indicated before buyers wasted their money on it."
1,Copy machine,Save your money. This is just an old book someone copied on a scanner and had published in a nice cover. Good quotes and observations on Zorn. That's about it.
3,Bah.....,"I have MUCH love for Lordz of Brooklyn, so when they changed their name and their sound, I had to go buy it. Not only did they change their sound, they lost their nuts, and became a boy band!! Terrible change!! Outlaw is a catchy tune, and thanks to the masterful Everlast, The Brooklyn way (the song) is good.Mama's boy grabs your heart. Those songs somewhat help the album along, but overall it is a turd. I give it 3 stars only out or respect, and for Everlast, but it's really not good. The Lordz need to go back to bar room brawls--like All in the family!! They call this punk/hip hop, but it's more like punk/boy band.C'mon Lordz, get your balls back guys!!!!"
3,let down,"I was expecting so much...movie didn't live up to the hype. Movie was good, visually impressive but was let down by story and screenplay."
3,alot of special effects,"it was ok, my son liked it much more than I. It is definitely a guys movie more. But not upset over purchasing for an evening..."
4,Immortals,I thought the movie was very good. The special effects were excellent. I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys action packed films.
1,kepp the volume down,"So will the film studio paid for speakers and amps damaged by some of the worst sub sonic noise heard in some time. The sound is atrocious, almost as atrocious as the film....300 was a superior product in every way. Keep the volume down"
2,Too much whispering no solid storyline.,i have surrond sound Bose speakers and the music played great but the dialog was whispered and it left me wondering what was going on. The trailers played the best parts. I rented 300 again and saw good show afterwards.
5,Awesome,Big fan of these types of movies. If you liked 300 you will like this movie in my opinion. Awsome
2,"Really boring, takes itself way too seriously","This movie has a lot of attractive guys in it, but seriously... It seems way too stagey and costumey, and like the actors are obviously acting, and not very well, either.They way the ""important"" characters make big speeches every five minutes threatening someone with castration or whatever, trying to sound all deeply ominous and epic, it's just laughable.Lame movie, overall. If you're looking for something like Kingdom of Heaven or Braveheart or the recent Robin Hood, this movie is all wrong.It's ""serious"" but only in the way it takes itself WAY too seriously, and not because it's any good, or has any kind of non stupid story."
2,Pretty with nothing else,"Just boring. The only thing that kept me going was Cavill's abs. The conversations were slow, and the relationships were just dull."
2,Movie really a big disappointment.,"The beginning of movie had me at Awe!!!, then after the first 10 minutes of the movie it always filmed in the dark scene, which is hard to watch any action movie. I thought it would be like the movie ""300"", well I was WRONG!!! so I gave it a 2 star, they should of charged $0.99 to watch this movie not worth the $3.99 to watch."
2,Boooooooooo,"This movie is just a bunch of fight scenes that try to look like 300, loosely tied together by a flimsy plot. Half the time you had to suspend your disbelief, because the plot was too lazy to tie things together. You just had to make up in your mind how it all fit together. Boooooooooo!!!"
2,not what i had expected,"This move was not as good as they said it was on the ads. The move was nothing like 300 and how they clamied it to be. I would pass on this movie. It put me to sleep and was not as action packed like 300 was, i would pass on the movie"
3,Immortals,I enjoyed this film and it was nice to see some not so famous actors. I would have like to see more interaction with the gods.
4,Good Movie!!,Immortals: Action packed. I liked it.Great effects. I have always liked movies from that period of time with a little fantasy included.
2,"Great special effects and concept, actors and storyline....not so much","The movie looked like it would be pretty impressive when I saw the previews but this is the first movie that I can honestly say I would never have any desire to watch again. The story line had ups and downs. Some parts were pretty good while some parts left me thinking "".......what?""Like everyone else said they combined the elements of a lot of other movies and jumbled them all together so much that I really didn't know what to think.Some of the fight scenes are pretty impressive but the actor roles could have been so much better. I know it's a movie but I can't imagine anyone using actors in their late 20s-early 30s to portray the gods, especially Zeus and Poseidon. Also along the ""I know it's a movie but"" lines. Making the titans look like human sized parkour practitioners fell very short of what I would like to see."
2,"Too much talking, and weird over acted action -_-",dont buy it like i did ESpecially on 3D! not worth the money but worth renting it and that is all. I personally thought watching this movie in 3D would make me like it better but honestly it did not. has too many blah blah blah blah scenes for even to worth 3D. PLEASE just rent it not buy it! or if you want something worth really 3D money and TIME BUY HUGO 3D and The Adventures of TINTIN 3D you will not be dissapointed!
2,formula glitz that lacks an emotional core,"This is one of the big hollywood productions that mixes OK acting with an awful lot of CGI effects. It is supposed to re-create the myth of Theseus, with Gods, the Minotaur, the magic bow, and the seeds of Athens. There is absolutely nothing interesting or original about it, just a spectacle that could have come off a production line.I was disappointed because I am always on the lookout for a good mythic film because my kids enjoy them. There is nothing about this to recommend it."
2,noting close to 300,"The storyline was too simple, no surprises and not engrossing. The fight scenes were too short and did not show any real heroism. U just didnt fall in love with Thesaeus, although Cavil's acting was pretty good. There should have beeen more scenes to showcase the power of the bow. The gods are too weak, they got their butt kicked by the titans and have to run in the end. 300 with Gerard butler screaming "" THIS IS SPARTA"" still reigns as the one with the better plot. picture and action. Rent this movie to watch but dont buy it..."
2,weak,"This movie reminds me of someone growing up on 300, Troy and Braveheart. Many of the scenes look like they were ""stolen"" from those that came before it. The editing for this movie is weak and gives it a ""choppy"" feel. I was looking for an action flix to kick back with, this movie didn't make the cut."
2,Immortality --- Soooo Boring,After looking forward to this movie for some time I was really disappointed after watching. Nothing held my interest and there was so little fantasy in this fantasy it just crawled. And who decided Mickey Rourke should lead this film? As he claws his way through it in some of the most horrid costume design I've ever seen you want to run screaming from the TV.It seems the writers were given free run on rewriting mythology but then no one took advantage of it to make a decent film. You end up asking whose mythology is this? Why are the Titans stuck in a mountain? Why do the gods look like kids on their way to playschool? If they're immortal why are they dying in the end? Just one big IMMORTAL MISTAKE!
2,Disappointing,"I was dazzled by the trailer for this movie and rushed out to buy it with the highest of expectations. Bottom line-if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the best that this movie has to offer. Good acting, pretty impressive visual feel (similarities with 300), but lacks a compelling storyline, little suspense. (Spoiler warning) I loved the scences in the trailer with Theseus using that awesome bow, unfortunately, he hardly uses it in the movie and doesn't even have it in his possession very long. There's not actually that much fighting, the choreography is quite similar to 300 and not nearly as impressive the second time around. Some excessive brutality, creulty that I didn't like-elicited a shock effect, but didn't really add any value to the story."
2,Great Potential,"I gave this movie 2 stars because, to my opinion, it had great potential, but again, the movie never took off. The story was pretty bland and the rendition of Olympus pretty scanty. I found the new version of Clash of the Titans, to be a much better movie for story line and effects. Think twice before purchasing. Watch it first and if you think it is worth a place in your movie library, then by all means, go ahead and buy it. I was glad, I bought a used cheaper copy. BTW, the film was way too dark. I do not enjoy darker colors. It is not the first time that films are to my opinion, ruined because of lack of proper color and light."
1,"Terrible, just terrible","It has been a little while; well since ""Priest"" came out that I have written such a bad review. This movie was a complete waste of time and money, not only on my part; but on the parts of everyone who ""acted"" in it or had anything to do with its production. The characters were not sincere and I really think high school drama students could have done better. The whole thing seems to practically take place on the edge of a cliff in one part of the world or another, the costumes are silly, the Gods are always whining about something, and the special effects look like late 90s C G I. I couldn't even finish this whole movie, I shut it off with 15 minutes left to go; that's how bad it really was, I could not bring my self to sit there for 15 more minutes and spent the rest of the day wondering why I had watched the bulk of this thing in the first place."
3,It was ok,"Heard a lot of comparisons to ""300"". The movie falls well short of that. I understand it did quite well at the box office so perhaps my feelings are mine alone. I will be trading the movie for something else in the very near future however or perhaps re-gift it soon."
1,Save Your Money - Don't Bother,"You are not missing anything if you do not purchase or download this movie. It's a empty flick; nothing here. Trust me, you won't miss nothing. Keep it moving; there's nothing to see here."
3,dislodged broken case.,"The description said ""like new""The case was broken so when shipped the dvd slid around within the case and got scratched to heck. -Still playable, but expected better."
2,Terrible movie,"Was very excited to see this movie in 3d well the only good parts are in the commercials, the movie itself in my opinion had way too much talk not enough action, 300 was a movie I bought right after it released, this movie does have many beautiful scenes and the fighting scenes were entertaining just too few and far between. Immortals will never find itself on my movie shelf.."
1,Regret,"Went to see this movie in the theater and end up paying 32 dollars for this trash. This movie was so bad that halfway through the film, I felt embarrassed for paying money to watch this."
2,Watch this just for the action,"I just saw this movie not too long ago. It was exactly what I expected, that is, only the last few minutes was actually worth watching. It was not as good as 300, but lets face it, 300 wasn't that good anyways. It pretty much starts out with a lame God-type-of-story, and everyone was preparing for some large scale battle. There are plenty of blood, not much sex, not enough action, and the storyline was just a fill-in, kinda like a video game. The action was great. The scenery was great, although probably not realistic. You can tell there's a lot of GCI that went into making this movie. That said, I think it is still worth watching at least once if you like action movies. If you're looking for a real story, don't waste your time here."
1,wish someone whould've run ME through with a spear...,I didn't know what I was looking at on the screen half the time or why the characters where in the places and positions they were in. Or maybe I just didn't care. It was hard to tell. I can't remember ever being this bored in a movie in my entire life. 2 hours of lackluster story and action where choreographed men were jabbing each other with cheap sticks just to see 15 minutes of stunning visual effects and fighting.Not worth it. Don't buy this movie.
1,"Wow, now that was a bad movie","I have to admit it has been a long time since I wasted 110 minutes of my life. It wasn't enough to have a plot that bounced around like a lottery ball, the bad acting, predictable story line, and really poor 3D effects topped it off. Do yourself a favor and watch 300 again if you are in the mood for a movie like this and believe it or not...Clash of the Titan's is better."
4,Rent this one,"If you liked 300, then you will probably like this. Stylized fighting, blood and gore. Also a good twist on mythology. Bought this on blu ray and have watched it twice."
1,Bad picture quality very dark movie!,"With the technology we have today, I'm surprised that they did not use cutting edge technology. Most of the scenes looked fake and unimpressive. The costume was too funny! I laughed a few times at the God's costume. It looked like they were going to some kind of holloween party LOL! Videophiles will hate this movie because of the bad black level, and I'm watching this on a calibrated display. I've watched countless movies and this is the only movie I had to adjust my screen's brightness. The scenes were way too dark . It looks like it was made in a cheap studio. Overall I give it a one star for terrible picture quality and bad storyline."
3,Immortals on Amazon Instant Video,"We tried watching this, but the video had to stop repeatedly in order to load. We ended up just turning it off. I'm sure the video would have been great, but the repeated loading was aggravating."
1,I want my $3.99 back.,"Two reviews from friends and I actually decided to rent this awful movie from Amazon. 300 is a million times better than this. Even the sad remake of Clash of the Titams was much better. I feel like I wasted two hours and four dollars for nothing. My time would have been better spent watching tv reruns on Amazon Prime than waiting for something redeeming to happen in this movie. If you want to see this, wait for it hit Amazon Prime or better yet, regular tv. You won't miss anything by waiting."
2,This one will definitely clash with your wallet!,"This has to be almost as bad as ""Clash of the Titans"". A real snooze fest especially in the middle. You can tell that everything is fake. The only reason to watch this movie is for the hunky guys. I enjoyed all the actors much more in other movies or shows (The Tudors). Don't waste your money. I had a free promo code at Redbox otherwise I would be really angry."
1,If you need to sleep watch this movie,"What can I say, this movie made me tired. Possibly one of the longest most boring films I've seen. 300 was great, this was a failed attempt at making another 300."
2,3D could be better,I watched the 3D version of Transformers: Darkside of the moon and was very pleased. It would appear someone decided to make a 3D version of Immortals after the fact and the results were disappointing
2,Too dark to see,"I think the title says it all. The plot was lame and the film was shot so dark that it's difficult to make out a lot of the action. If you haven't seen this movie, don't bother. You didn't miss much."
1,Worse than Clash of the Titans! What were they thinking?!,"I could not even finish watching this sorry excuse for a movie that is supposed to be about Theseus. Theseus is my 3rd favorite greek hero and they ruined his entire image with this pitiful movie. The movie makes no sense. They say the are going to go somewhere and then BOOM! they r there. There is NO journey and the jump from scene to scene with no explanation. The Gods are horribly portrayed and the acting is weak. A slap in the face to mythology. Lastly, they give no background on anybody so you have absolutely NOOO emotional attachment to a single character.This movie is complete and total garbage."
2,Not a film you will remember,"This is another 300ish film only this time with the theme of greek myths, over the top acting, CGI to the 3rd power, and the been there done that feeling of every movie like this. The movie is cheesy mostly and delivers plenty of action but no story to drawn you into it hardly. It's more like watching cartoon violence, it shallow and over the top but you don't expect much from it because it's a cartoon. That is pretty much what this movie is. Oh well, it gave me something to do. Also it's too long."
5,Awsome,The movie arrived on time like it's supposed to and the quality of the movie was good will purchase more movies.
5,Blu-Ray Quality (Short n Simple),"I have recently added this movie to my collection. Sound 5 stars, Video 5 stars. The movie is worth getting on Blu-Ray as all the special effects scene look amazing on 1080P."
5,It is what it is,"This movie never tries to be anything but a brutal, visually appealing action movie in the same vein of the 300, Scorpion King, Conan the Barbarian, etc. and those who are disappointed by it for not treading new ground are unbearably pretentious jerks. Just shut up and enjoy the movie (you know you did). It doesn't have to break new ground to be a good movie. Honestly, we live in a world where movies like Chronicles of Riddick get lambasted by critics while sweeping up at the box office, and movies like Brokeback Mountain get the Oscars because anal sex and cowboys is so classy and original. Puh-lease."
1,Don't waste your time,"What a disappointment and waste of money. This movie was terrible, the previews literally showed the best part of the film. The ""hero"" spends most of the movie getting beat up, and losing his grip on the one thing he needs to protect at all costs. If your looking for something like 300, just watch 300. Avoid this movie."
4,Exceeded expectation,Story was good and special effects were good as well. Good mix of mythology and history in my opinion. Could see follow up to this movie.
3,"All men's souls are immortal,","but the souls of the righteous are immortal and divine. - SocratesKing Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) megalomaniac only wants the world. After dispatching the mother of Theseus (Henry Cavill) he expects Theseus to join his cause. However the gods including Zeus (Luke Evans) expect Theseus to do his duty and save mankind without the help of the gods. It is not easy wondering who to put our emotions behind.This presentation is just a tad of distortion of mythical history. A little too much CGI almost makes it a cartoon. There is lots of action and flying blood, one gratuitous birthday suite form the backside, scrawny titans and contemporary dialog. But most of all there is lots of loud music and noise."
2,Big disappointment,"The actors are in place, the storyline has potential, but.... So much of the movie is CG, and if what I ""see"" as CG actually isn't, that just makes it worse. Dialogue is replaced by subtle hints and gore, lots and lots of gore. The battle between the Titans and the Immortals is never really explained, never really fulfilled. A god who murders his own child for a seemingly small infraction; gods who sit back and wait to see if the evil person actually able to release the Titans does so; a wall that contributes to thousands dead with nothing gained by it, a young man who has Zeus's favor but why? Wow! Time is so short and fleeting, and that is time I can never get back again! Don't waste your time."
3,To many twist to the story for my taste,"I think they took a few to many liberties in the story line taken from Greek Mythos; they changed things enough to make it unrecognizable. Often you can't tell who is who and characters make mistakes that would be extremely unlikely for the character they are pertraying. Therefore I can't give much of rating for this but if your not a stickler on the portrayal of the Greek Mythos it has its own twist on a story and just presents it different way you may enjoy it, some of the effects are very well done and I'd have to say the acting is fairly good to."
3,Immortals DVD Blue Ray,"I pre ordered this DVD thinking it would be sent on the firt day it was released, I was mistaken, it was 8 days later thatit was finnally shipped and 11 days before I recieved the item. The movie itself was disapointing, not Amazon's fault, great trailer, mediocre movie. The package was what I expected, and the product was fine, just disapointed in the shipping."
3,Average,"This movie does not live up to the hype. Since when can a god be killed? How exactly does that work? The unrealism was too much and did not match the level of violence. The premise was good, but awful execution."
3,meh,had a lot of potential but overall pretty lack-luster. The acting wasn't anything to brag about nor the story. It just left a lot to be wanted.
2,Good effects acting not bad story atrocious,Would give 2.5 because effects were pretty good acting was above my expectations. Did keep my attention throughout but story was awful. It could probably suit as an entertaining movie with low expectations going in but wouldn't watch again it's a movie to show off what new toys Hollywood has and there are much worse choices out there.
4,Immortals,"This a grate movie to watch,comes with a good action movie and a movie that keeps your attention from start to finish."
2,Don't waste your money,"Heavy on CGI, lots of blood and guts most of which are unnecessary, fairly well acted, poor story line. Very predictable. Don't waste your money wait for free view on cable then watch something else."
1,Stupid movie,The acting is horrible. The effects are good but you cant even do anything to mask the horrible storyline and script writing. I thought this would be similar to 300 which I love. Nope. Not even close. The fight scenes aren't even impressive.
2,"No kids, please","The Immortals was an interesting look at Greek mythology. Unfortunately, the gratuitous violence and the grotesque battle scenes made the movie much less enjoyable."
2,BOY THIS MOVIE REALLY SUCKD IN BOTH STORY TELLING AND IN 3D PICTURE,"I DONT USALLY WRITE REVIEWS ABOUT MOVIES BUT BOY I JUST NEEDED TO SAY SOMETHING.I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THIS MOVIE FOR SOME TIME NOW AND COULDDNT WAIT TO BUY IT ON 3D BLURAY, I WATCHED ABOUT 45 MINS OF IT LAST NIGHT IN 3D AND HAD TO TURN IT OFF BC HOW BAD THE STORY LINE WENT, IT JUMPED ALL OVER THE PLACE THAT IT DIDNT MAKE ANY SENSE WHAT WAS GOING ON, AND FOUND OUT THAT THIS FILM WASNT SHOT IN 3D BUT WAS SHOT IN 2D AND CONVERTED INTO 3D WHICH IS A GARBAGE WAY TO MAKE A 3D FILM, AND TO TOP IT OFF THIS FILM IS VERY DARK, NOT A GOOD WAY TO WATCH A 3D FILM, NOTHING POPS AND THE DEPTH IS VERY CRAPPY, I EVEN TOOK OFF MY GLASSES AND THE PICTURE WAS VERY CLEAR, I WOULD STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM AND SAVE YOUR MOVIE FOR ANOTHER 3D MOVIE"
4,"Liked this one, reminded me of 300","Immortals reminded me very much of 300. I enjoyed the action and special effects, especially with the epic battles. The contrasting colors and overall dark feel of the movie added to its unique and artistic style. I could watch this one again and recommend it to others."
3,Not bad if you have time to waste,"Rent, dont buy. It was not bad. Decent entertainment on a rainy day with nothing else to do. I don't regret watching it. I'm glad I didnt go see it at the theater and I'm glad I didnt buy it."
1,Not good,"I am a lover of all things mythological. I go into these types of movies not expecting Citizen Kane but a good ""popcorn"" flick.This movie was bad. The story was disjointed, the characters on dimensional, the fight scenes conventional. I could not wait for the movie to end.The story had potential but it was an epic swing and miss."
2,Dark...,"Maybe we'd have enjoyed this movie more, if we actually could have seen more of it. As it was, our dvd was too dark to see even half of the movie on our big-screen tv. Was it like this for other people? Why waste time making a movie that cannot be viewed worth a damn?"
1,Boring,"I wanted it to be good, but it isn't. This film is boring and the costumes look like they're from a Las Vegas show. The only bright spot is Henry Cavill, whose acting is good in spite of the poor script and poor direction."
1,Do not watch!!!!!!!,"I love Greek mythology and am a long-time fan of movies such as ""Troy"" and ""300"" but THIS.....is GARBAGE!!!!! Soon as I finished watching it, I threw the disc across the room, stomped on it and threw it in the garbage along with the case and all. Those of you who want to watch this, PLEASE....save your money!!!!! I regret seeing this!"
3,Immortals,"Was a great movie, Reminded me of gladiator and 300 mixed with a good story line. Like to see more on this story as well."
3,Decent Movie,Interesting movie...worth a rental at least. Some good graphics and fight scenes. Interesting story as well. I'll probably watch it again sometime.
3,Immortal it's not,Immortal not! Memorable also not! Too bad hollywood has given up acting and actors for CGI. Perhaps they should give the cartoonists some decent food so that they do not have nightmares and a sour outlook on life.
3,Too much hype.,"The movie did not follow any recognized mythology, instead it delved into pure Hollywood creativity. It could have been a winner, instead it is relegated to the dustbin of Hollywood flops. The scenery was great, the storyline was abysmal. The acting talent was wasted on a lousy scrip. Too bad, better luck next time."
2,"""Immortals""","I recently watched this film and found the title misleading. Although the name of the movie is ""Immortals"", it is mostly about mortals. There is only about 3 minutes worth of immortal content in this film. The rest of the movie deals with the shame of being born a bastard."
1,"Garbage movie, annoying ads","This movie was pretty poor. Worse, Fox Sports has decided to overlay a delayed ad over their MLB page for this amazon page. Every time I try to click on a link I get sent here instead, then have to go back to the fox page, close the ad, and then click on the link I really wanted to read. I guess such a boring movie really needs to force people over to Amazon to have any hope of selling its blu rays, eh?"
3,300 it's not,"I've seen lots of people compare this to 300, it's not even close to that, nor do I think it was meant to be. That being said, I still found the movie to be interesting, action packed, and was intrigued by the Greek Mythology incorporated into and driving the storyline. This is a fantasy story, and not a bad one, made all the better by Mickey Rourke's portrayal of King Hyperion."
4,Immortals Review,I was pleasantly surprised with this movie...It was fun and action packed moive with a good story line. It was entertaining and well worth the rental.
2,Nothing can save a movie if the story is bad,"Visually, it is very good. The colors are brilliant. The special effects are very good. If you do see it make sure it is blu-ray.The acting overall was quite good, I thought. I did like the acting of King Hyperion.What let it down for me was the story which I thought was terrible.So I would not see it again nor recommend it."
4,It's Not 300! It Holds It's Own.,"The biggest mistake they made was marketing this movie like 300. This film moved on it's own steam in my opinion. Just like every other moviegoer that saw this, I thought it was supposed to be the next 300. Of course, this wasn't the case which left me midly dissappointed, however, it started to take on it's own shape. All the actors and actresses did a fine job. The interaction with the Gods was an amazing addition and was graphically stunning from beginning to end.If you haven't seen this movie, see it. I feel it's worth it. Keep in mind, this movie is not like 300. If there's any relation to 300 it's by special effects only. If this movie was marketed as an original peace instead making it seem like it was ""300 Part 2"", I think the perception of it would have been different. It's a solid action/fantasy in it's own right."
2,Read THE KING MUST DIE and THE BULL FROM THE SEA instead!,"Basically this movie sucks! Henry Cavill is, as always, awesome. He makes an excellent Theseus, looks fabulous shirtless and can act. Micky O'Rouke is wonderful, impressively evil and scary. Luke Evans is good as Zeus. And the visuals, colors, composition, are excellent. But the story and dialogue are ridiculous. Why did they used the names of Theseus, Phaedra, etc., when those characters have over 2,000 years of their own powerful, meaningful legends, mythologies, books, poems, movies? And Steven Dorf, second billing, was out of place and looked bad next to the godlike Cavill, Theseus."
1,Murky lighting prevents viewing,"This film is almost impossible to watch on Amazon Instant Video. The screen is so dark you cannot see the actors in more than half the scenes. I've heard that movies shot in 3D are dark and dingy, but this is ridiculous."
2,Tedious assault on history,The movie begins with a great deal of excitement and a sense of some ancient parable of forboding.Yet it then disintegrates into a series of gratuitous violent scenes. Mickey Rourke is good for that kindof action. Freida Pinto (of Slum Dog Millionaire fame) is a welcomed addition to the cast but not even she can save this script for scene after scene of murder and mayhem. A good film for an after-football game when you team lost. A good way to vent!
2,Overrated,"If you want to see fighting by all means watch this move. The story line, which somewhat exists, is ok but holds little depth. If you are expecting a movie that has an on going plot this is not it. The storyline wasn't made to evolve you but just tells you what is going on."
2,Someone who bought this thinking it would be like 300,"Not worth the money people! it wasn't the greatest storyline i've seen. The battle sequences were okay but not great. If you're gonna buy this film wait till the price goes to at least $10, that's honestly how low i value this film. I made the mistake of buying it without watching in theaters. Don't make the same mistake."
2,movie is not immortal,"Let me start by saying the C.G.I. was great and the scenery they created was awesome, and the colors were outstanding. That being said the rest of the aspects of the movie were weak. The storyline was good, but presented poorly. The acting,except for Mickey Rourke as the evil king, was only passable. And come on!!!!!! Do we really need that much blood guts and gore to tell a story. I think Tarsem Singh did the movie a disservice by going over the top on the GORE. I would have rated the movie higher if the violence was left in with a lot less blood and guts."
2,Ungodly,"I was not impressed by this movie. Yet another 300-type attempt with a little Clash of the Titans, but it just didn't excite or intrigue me. The effects were very good, but nowadays effects are mostly good all the time, so I'm no longer in unbelieving awe. I still love great effects in movies, don't get me wrong, but it's the norm now. Now I need good acting and story and characters. This seemed to be made just to show off extreme violence with gods and titans. That's it. At the end I felt nothing. In my favorite movies I'm looking for something profound to remember and talk about, and a reason to come back. Did not get it here. These movies that have tried to imitate 300's effects method still fall short of that movie. However, I did like Henry Cavill and Mickey Rourke's performances. This Zeus pissed me off though."
1,Immortals,The movie sucked 75% of it was so dark all you could see was a dark screen with a few shadows. I gave it one star for the sound. They would been better off just making a CD of the sound.
1,so bad i'm compelled to write this review,"Well I'm glad I only rented it. Just watch ""300"" again not that that was any good either. don't bother with this drivel. It was just a cash grab by the actors."
1,Believe Me... Don't Waste Your Time or Money,Probably the worst story line for a movie in recent memory. The movie had some much potential but it failed so miserably I wouldn't watch it again even for free.
1,This is not fair to the Greek Mythology,"This is my 1st review ever. Being a long time a lover of Greek Mythology, after all I was born and raised in Greece, and having watched Troy and 300 which I would have rated 3.0 each, this is probably the worst attempt to capture a very significant tale. They took a few scripts and made it as boring as possible. It offends us as a nation to deal with manic depressive tendencies by the producers, completely irrelevant to amazing scripts, bringing and promoting such an atrocity as the Immortals.Thank you."
1,Urrrrgh!!!!! Waste of money and time....,"Really bad! All the other reviewers who gave it the lowest rating collectively have it right on the ""attributes"" of this B grade piece of ............ I predict that it will not even make it into the campy category before it is lost, intentionally for sure, in the bowels of time."
1,Omg! This was painful to watch. plot had tons of holes. action scenes poor.,"Uggh. No budget! Throw in t and a and cheap fight scenes. little choreography. he nails the girl after knowing her, uhh, 3 days?"
1,Two MAJOR Issues,"I bought the full version of this movie due to me thinking that I'd want to see it again, but in reality I never saw it to begin with. The movie was edited so dark that I never really knew what was going on -- I basically had to listen to the movie to try and get some grip on the storyline. It literally was not a viewable movie.Speaking of storyline, where was it? There were so many loose-ends, no character progression, and what little of either was scattered across the movie had no logical foreshadowing or climax to begin with. I'm a pretty big history buff, I know the story of Theseus and while I won't compare anything to the original myths - If you don't know the story, you probably won't understand WTF is going on. At All."
5,Outstanding,"the premise of the movie is based on mythology and well executed. If you liked 300, you're going to love this movieGet it"
4,No glitches!,For action and adventure this movie has some great scenes and it will keep you glued to the screen! recommended.
4,Good to Rent,I rented this (it is on netflix now) and it was worth. The story is so so but the visuals totally make up for it.
1,Save your money on this one,This was probably one of the worst produced movies I have ever watched. I was most thankfull that it was given to me and I didn't waste the money to purchase it. The plot was poor and cinematography was worse.Save your time and money on this one!
1,Do not even consider watching.,"Worst movie. I could not have been more bored with this trite attempt at re-duxing a new 300. It was trying to be way too ""artsy"" in the graphics department without a fully developed and intelligible script. Mickey Rourke's performance was sub par and a sad attempt at furthering his some what lack lustre ""acting"" career. The editing was horrendous... a plot that really goes no where ""exciting"", lack lustre ""Gods""... without reiterating what I have already said... don't bother with this film it is boring, inane and you wish that you hadn't have sat through it."
4,Beats 300,Great fight scenes. The leading lady is nice. Mickey Rourke definitely delivers. I would have liked it a bit better if the weird 300 look was not in every scene. Maybe just use that to indicate the Gods are present instead. Not a bad action movie.
2,N2F,"Not my favorite, but from the makers of 300, it is worth watching.... once.... A B C D E F G H I J K L"
1,Movie to encourage mass murderers--The Immortals,Gratuitous violence; skewed world view. Definitely not for kids! The chaos of the gods and humans portrayed here is not something to elevate as worth imitating.
2,Meh,"For an action movie, it needs a lot more action and a lot less bad drama and cheesy dialogue. Pass."
2,Did they HAVE ONLY 3 SETS FOR THIS MOVIE!!!!???,"Half the movies scenes are on the same small sets which are suppose to be beautiful because they are on a cliff side? This movie took a wrong turn from the moment the narrator begins speaking. The storyline is unclear about what the Titans were doing in this. Its always about the Titans being the secret to everything, but these Titans were just something new and stupid. There isn't much character development and even fight scenes were pathetic. At one point the soldiers are smiling when Thesis is giving a horrible, typical speech about going to face the stronger enemy. This was as bad as bolly-woods attempts on war movies. I don't expect much from this director or producers next time."
2,Not worth it,"Plenty of action, just not that great of a film. The sound level was inconsistent and the picture a bit too dark to make out certain scenes. Thumbs down."
1,Speical effects; no plot,"Mindless battle scenes,many of which are too darkly filmed, make up the majority of this film. Hoped it would get better. It didn't. Don't waste your time."
2,immortals,"i am a film watcher, all types. I really enjoy scifi and action. this movie had action and the special effects were good, but the performaces and the story fell way short. would not recommend to other except for the fight scenes and special effects, but there are movies will all available, story, acting, action and special effect. very dissappointing."
2,Okay for what it is,I like movies about Greece and the Gods and this one was okay for what it was. Yes it's definitely in the style of 300 but it's a little better than that thanks to Cavill and Dorf. The action is okay but its a little longer than it needed to be.
4,immortals was pretty good,"thought this movie would have been better,it was ok special affects were good in HD must have a big screen with surround sound , made the movie, price was great and I thought it was better then 300"
1,don't bother,"How can a movie take the great story of Theseus and turn it into mush? You get the feeling that whoever wrote the script knew absolutely nothing about the story they were trying to tell. Just making it up as they went along. This is just another in a line of movies lately , 300, Clash of the titans, and Avatar that take a great story and butcher it. The trend today in movies seems to be all mindless action and visuals. but little story. When all someone can say about a movie is that it ""looks good"", then it's a movie to avoid. I suppose it has appeal to those who aren't very discriminating in their tastes. But anyone who wants a movie that's deeper than a piece of paper should avoid it."
1,Immortals: Rest In Peace,"Things to know: I typically love the big, bloody sandal movies -- or any costume epic, really. And the prospect of looking at Henry Cavill for two hours seemed like a nice Sunday afternoon indulgence. But, oooh, Stinky McStinkerson. All the chiseled yumminess in the world couldn't save this thing from itself. The storyline and script felt like a random paste-up from the bottom of someone's hamster cage (a purpose for which the copy was infinitely better suited). Even if the story was a little more coherent, it would be impossible to tell with the horrible sound editing. Between the ridiculous masks and some digitally forced stage depth, big chunks of dialogue seemed to be lodged in the rock walls. What a mess."
1,Zero stars,"This, unfortunately, is a complete and utter waste of time. From butchering the original Theseus story, to awful acting by Mickey Rourke, it just cannot get worse. I LOVE Greek mythology, but this ... This looks like somebody was on acid while writing the screenplay. I had such high hopes for this movie, and this ... This will only be good if used as a part of Mystery Science Theater 3000."
4,Lots of Violence...but some deeper messages,"This movie is grisly, very violent. But, see beneath to the deeper spiritual messages. Plus, you can see how God is and how He is not!"
2,Would not see Avatar,"Can't stand blue people. Not even the chick from Farscape. These Titans had no individual personalities. That removes a whole star easily. What I consider a weak story with poor continuity-it seemed to almost go in reverse at times- kills another star. Zeus was an idiot and I couldn't care about any of the characters. That takes care of another star. The visuals were entertaining, but, I preferred 300 over-all. But, you go ahead and enjoy."
3,Have I seen this movie before?,"Like many movies that have come before it, this movie is centered around ancient civilizations, battlegrounds, and myths. It doesn't have much particularly new to offer, unfortunately, which is probably the main reason why it seems to be slipping through the cracks into obscurity. Probably the best thing about this movie is Mickey Rourke in the role of the lead villain. He makes a great villain, to be sure! As I was sitting there watching this movie, I couldn't help but think I had seen this movie before. There are so many similarities between this movie and movies like300,Clash of the Titans (2010),Troy, and evenThe Scorpion King, that I just didn't find it all that interesting. It's not a terrible movie, but without much to distinguish itself, it isn't a great movie, either..."
1,Terrible Story,The story line for this movie was horrible at best. The graphics saved the movie. Immortals was a dissappointment from my perspective.
3,so-so,"As much as I love MA, this was not energetic track I was hoping for, ""False Flags "" is even worse! The video track is Very good though!"
4,Educational entertainment,"I am very resistant to the idea of gaming systems (Nintendo, sega, etc) in my house. Not only for my childrens' sake-- I'm concerned that they affect children's attention spans, and even their brain development-- but also for my husband's-- he would become an addict if we had one in the house.This is a great, extremely inexpensive way to give my children some experience w/ electronic learning without having to go ""whole hog"" and let one of those bigger systems into my house. Very little equipment, only a few discs available-- but tons of learning material. I bought mine on clearance at a retailer that's been offering ""the best, the only, and the unexpected for 159 years"", knowing that their products rarely disappoint. This one sure didn't!"
1,outdated info,I got this looking for some insight into a workout and diet plan andall I got was outdated info from the 1970's. Save your money.
3,Probably a great DVD,"This is probably a great DVD. Now if only Amazon.com could get the freaking thing in stock and send out my order, then I could write a real review of The Saxon Chronicles!!!"
1,Very poor,"This book is mainly useless. If you want to know how each piece of the MS server 2000 works, just look at the help files. This book simply repeats that. It does NOT tell you how the pieces work together. For example, if you wanted to set up a DNS server and Web server that work together on the same computer(as is a common task for a lot of people) this book fails. Most books are like this one. BOTTOM LINE - They tell you how to install a piece of the os along with a vague descrition of that piece and move on to the next topic. This is ALREADY in the MS help files and mostly uselss."
2,Not useful.,"This book is rather useless. The style of writing is boring: it's like reading a phone book. There is no explanation on ""why"" this feature works. It focuses on ""how"" to do this or that. More like a robot cookbook."
5,LAttimores Masterpiece of translation of Aeschlyus,This edition is the materworks of two great men Aeschylus and Richmond Lattimore. I have read a dozen of translations of Aeschylus and this has no rival. As well the whole series edited by Green and Lattimore are the best compelation of all the Greek tragedy to date. Lattimore understand the darkness and the fatilism of greek tragedy. The verse translation is flowing and rythmic as the greek is. The translation is loose and not exacting like Lattimores Illiad but he captures the theme better than a too literal translation would allow.
4,Burning The Apostle,"Well you should know that I've read all the November Man novels. I love this series (wish there were more). Granger's plots suck you in, as did this one. Read all of them if you can find them. It's worth a trip to the library for the ones out of print."
4,Review of Storr's 'Harper's University',"This is a history of fair quality. I found it a little less personal than Goodspeed's, but also a little less like a tedious checkbook. I didn't find the prose very engaging, but it was informative. The most notable portion of Storr's history is his consideration of early educational policy at Chicago, and the development of its social life."
3,"Somewhat valuable, but impenetrable","If you're using this book for an in-person course on Farsi, it might be of use to you. But the grammar lessons are opaque and hard to follow. The author also professes a distaste for transliteration into latin characters - which might be a great approach to take in later courses in Farsi, but if you're a complete beginner, it just makes all the words hard to follow and creates a lot of confusion about pronunciation. There's also no English-Farsi word reference in the back, although there is a Farsi-English one. Bottom line: there are better lesson books out there on Farsi. Get one of them."
2,Not recommended unless you know the Persian alphabet.,"This book was required text for a beginning Persian class, and not a single person in the class liked it. While its lessons are geared for beginners, and the step by step approach to sentence building was good, the lack of translation into Roman characters makes it nearly incomprehensible unless you've had exposure to Persian characters. Even after I started understanding the characters, the printing in this book is so small that you practically need a magnifying class to be able to understand what you're seeing. This is not a good stand-alone book if you want to learn Persian."
3,A-ok,"This was required text book for a Persian class, I took two years ago. There are tons of typos, i mean tons!!! If this wasn't required, I would not recommend for those trying to learn such a beautiful language such as Persian."
2,More a suspense flick than horror,"This movie has mediocre acting and at times boring script. It relies more on the was it's filmed for the ""scareyness"" than on effects and gore. I will say I do like how it was filmed where it made you feel at times you were right in the house with the characters. When the killing begins, the movie moves fast and ends quick. Not a horrible film, but could have been better. Type of film to watch when you just wanna see a b-type low budget flick."
1,Sunbeam 4200 Smoothie Maker,"Assembling and disassembling this piece of equipment would discourage a person from ever using this item. It is far too complicated and has too many pieces that have to be washed each time it is used and then put back together again. One can expect to spend about 30 minutes to disassemble and reassemble the unit while following the assembly guide. In addition to that drawback, there isn't anything that should be placed in a dishwasher, so it has to be hand-washed and hand dried. An osterizer would be a much simpler and better choice!!!"
3,Falto la limusina,"El producto ofrecido indica ""con set de vehículos presidenciales"" sin embargo el paquete recibido llegó solo con el jeep, quedó faltando la limusina. Y no es que el paquete viniera con el espacio para limusina vacío sino que el paquete recibido no es el mismo de la foto pues el recibidio no tiene la limusina y a cambio trae un par de señales más, que desde luego no reemplazan la limusina."
2,"Nice set BUT no limousine in my kit at all, disappointed with that.","Nice set BUT no limousine in my kit at all, disappointed with that. the set we got was similar but not exact to image shown, no limo at all, no section for a limo, bummed out as really wanted that in the set."
2,A personal transformation throught the Alexander Technique,"I enjoyed reading the first part of the book about her recovery from polio through the Alexander Technique. Her character description of Alexander is her own view of a man who helped her tremendously but that she came to despise later. She reveals more herself than ""the man"" in this exercise. However, it is an excellent read that gave me a lot of hope for those who have suffered injuries and disabilities."
2,Pretty much a waste of time,"I have very limited time to workout, and hoped this would be a quick, effective, FUN workout for lighter days. However, I should have listened more to the other reviewers who said the instruction is bad... it isn't just bad, it doesn't exist!!! I think the dance sequences would be fairly easy, IF they were broken down better, and there were some simple instructions as you're going along! But there really aren't, and it's hard to get a good workout when you're spending the whole time trying to figure out what the dancers on screen are doing. Honestly...don't waste your time with this one, unless you enjoy being frustrated and have plenty of spare time to learn the routines and get them down before you actually start getting a good workout!"
2,Hard to follow steps,"I'll admit, I'm not very good at learning new steps, but this was more diffcult than most. Just when you start to get it, she changes steps. I later read she is a dancer, so this workout is easy for her. If it wasn't diffcult to follow, I'd give it a 4."
2,not for beginners,"Jennifer is fun and energetic but doesn't give you enough time to pick up the steps. I'm not a very coordinated person and while I CAN get through this dvd after three weeks of every other day use, I don't enjoy it. If you can dance, then you can probably pick it up quickly. Like I said, it's fast paced and would be fun, I just wouldn't recommend it for a beginner."
4,Challenging,"Not quite what I expected, but I am working hard at trying to master the dance steps. A smooth surface is needed to dance on..not carpet."
3,Moves taught too fast,"This is a great DVD for experienced dancers or those who really have the motivation to learn. I used it only once but got frustrated trying to learn the moves and not getting the workout I wanted. The instructor is good however and for those who have experience in dance, they may catch on easier. I'm sure the other dancers in this DVD took a good amount of time to learn the moves."
1,This workout is not what it advertises...,"There's so many reasons I didn't like this and am rabidly searching for someone, ANYONE to rid me of it before I just pitch it in the trash can.*It's not dance. It's regular fluffy girl aerobics pretending to be dance. Boring.*The ""instructor"" has the personality of a limp dishrag and honestly, if I heard her say ""I wanna see your personality in this girls!"" one more time... I woulda broke my TV.*It's way too difficult to follow unless you are an aerobics maven. I'm only slightly over weight compared to some of my friends (147 lbs at 5 ft 4 in) and I could barely get into some of the steps before Ms. Galardi was spritely bouncing into something else. So it's going to send you back to the couch with some Doritos if you're like most of us out there that would need such a DVD.I wish I had ignored the professional or spotlight reviews and just read the customer ones. This DVD is AWFUL!!"
1,video is hard to follow,I purchased this video thinking it would be a fun workout. I think that the dance moves are explained too fast and I found myself getting very frustrated trying to keep up with the instructor. I would not recommend this video to anyone who is not a dancer.
2,Steps are way too fast and hard to follow!,"I bought this last December thinking it would be great fun and good exercise too. Boy was I wrong! It was so frustrating trying to follow the steps! They do not show the steps to you slowly first, and go way too fast into the routine for me to figure it out and continue on. The only one I could do was the ballet. At least that was slow enough to see what they were doing. I tried it twice and gave it to my 17 year old twin daughters. They had a good laugh, got their feet all tangled up and gave it back! No thanks! I was so disappointed. It is a good idea from Prevention magazine, but not for me!"
1,Not for those who are inexperienced,"This has to be one of the worse exercise dance video i have seen in a long time. The instructor does not teach the steps or the routines very well and the fast pace of the video benefits no one except those who are very experienced dancers. the camera is constantly moving around and doesn't focus to well on the movement of the instructors and dancers feet. I have been a dancer for over 6 years and i found this video very confusing to follow and was very frustrated by the way the steps were explained quickly! This video should not be used by anyone who is not very familar with dance or who is a novice. If you want a good workout that incorporates cardio and dance you'd be better off with Redbook's ""Fat to Firm"""
1,not for beginners,This is not at all what I was looking for in a dance exercise video. I gave it away and will go back to Richard Simmons. I don't know how you can produce a dance exercise video without music!
1,Disappointng,"I was really excited when I saw this DVD and really DEFLATED when I actually attempted to complete it!The instructor gives relatively little if any INSTRUCTION on how to successfully complete moves; and she switches from combo to combo, move to move and it is virtually impossible to keep up. I have also never sweated so much in my life, mostly from a rise in my blood pressure from anger and frustration! I am in relatively good shape; I walk up to 3 miles a day and wanted this to break the routine. In only broke my spirits!Unless you are an accomplished club hopper or a trained hoofer, STAY AWAY! One of the worst workouts I have ever seen!"
1,Fast and uninformative,"My friend is trying to get in shape and recently bought this video. She invited me to do it with her. I have a background in dance and so it was a shock to me when certain aspect of proper alignment and placement were never stressed in this video. I even told me friend not to do one of the stretches at the end, because she could hurt her knees. Incorrect technique and alignment can be very dangerous and if repeated day after day can lead to overuse injuries. The moves were not broken down enough and I only picked them up because I am already familiar with them. The music was so subtle that it was really hard to dance to it. I was not a big fan of the choreography.If you are new to dance, I would suggest starting with another video. I don't know what video to recommend because I generally don't use videos to work out. If you aren't new to dance then this video might be less than desirable."
