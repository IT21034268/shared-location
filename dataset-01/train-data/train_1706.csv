5,"Bravo,Bravo,Encore!","A soundtrack that leaves you wanting more.It brought back all the hilarious parts from the movie.Buy this soundtrack,you won't be sorry!"
2,Song Missing,It's too bad they didn't include Petula Clark's Downtown in the soundtrack. Such a great song.
2,The Hosta Handbook,"Great content, bad layout. The strangely-sized pages, along with the super bulky plastic spiral binder make for an awkward book. The 500+ long skinny pages are like carrying around a half-ream of paper-- cut the long way. Very strange. Not a creative layout, if that's what they had in mind... just weird."
2,Two words.....,"...PROOF READER! Seriously, this book could have been a lot better, if only they would have employed someone to proof read the book before it was released to the public. There are too many grammatical errors to mention here, but because of the poor writing it was hard to finish the book. Otherwise it wasn't a total loss. It was relatively interesting, but certianly not as good as ""Monster,"" or ""My Bloody Life,"" both of which I would place at about 4 stars. That is of course, my own personal opinion, but read it for yourself. I'm sure you'll see what I'm talking about. P E A C E"
3,Cool!!!!!,this will go great with the iplay horse bundle i might get for chirtmas!!!!! she is so cute with her english riding outfit!!!!!
5,Wonderful Anecdotes about Publishing,"Bennett Cerf, who older readers, will remember as the witty and charming panelist on the TV Show, ""What's My Line?"", from the l950s and 60s, will not be disappointed with his recollections. He has incredible anecdotes and reminiscences of many of the top authors of the 20th Century, including Eugene O'Neill, William Faulkner, Sinclair Lewis, and, yes, even Truman Capote. He also offers a wonderful history of publishing in New York, and knew everyone from Simon and Schuster to Alfred Knopf. He brings all these names and times to life in a series of short, but memorable, chapters. If you love reading, this book will enhance your love and understanding of your favorite writers. It's the perfect book for your nightstand. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
3,"Romantic, but trite lyrics.","At first this cd sounded really smooth and enjoyable (ala tindersticks, red house painters). Yet multiple listens find me getting quite perterbed with the absolute dullness of every songs lyrics. I suppose its mood music. Its not bad, its just not interesting.Its seductive, but... not challenging."
4,shawn gaskill,"this is disc 7 in the cell games sagaepisodes -169,170,171gohan reaches a new level never seen before"
5,Inspiring,"Sandra Wilson does an excellent job in constantly referring you to pray for enlightenment and healing throughout the entire book. Her use of scriptures inspired me to put down the book and pick up the Bible...more validation that this book truly reveals a Christian approach/guidelines to healing past issues. While difficult facing the realistic pictures of your past, this book inspires you to pray for healing and to lean on God to help you through this time. Through many tears and much anger, it took me about a month to finish the book. But once I picked it back up, my perception changed and truly found this to be one of the better books I've read during my journey of healing.Again...it's a difficult process to begin, but you will not be disappointed in the end."
5,Past Pain,"Great book, got a lot out of it during a class I needed it for. Wouldn't have chosen it otherwise. Glad I did!"
4,Modern-mainstream trio jazz at its best,"This is Philly Joe at the top of his game - fiery, imaginative & supportive. My four (4) other favorite drummers are Roy Haynes, Elvin Jones, Tony Williams & Jack DeJohnette. The Wynton Kelly trio with Jimmy Cobb on drums played together for years & years both as Miles's rhythm section, on their own, and as the stellar all-star backups on record dates for Wes Montgomery, Joe Henderson and others. I believe Jimmy Cobb was greatly influenced by this album as his role with the trio around this time became increasingly assertive. Wynton & Paul Chambers are superb but Philly Joe shines on this record on the level of Milestones & Blue Train."
5,Excellent for Olde Worlde European tastes,"I actually borrowed this book from the library and thought it was just excellent. i would love to own it but alas it is out of print so I will have to scan the used book stores etc. Galentines, pates & pies etc. do take time and effort and this book shows the detail of how to do it. I am from europe (England) and now resident in the USA and really miss the pies, pates and galantines which are seen in the deli's so the next best thing is to get this book, experiment and make your own, it is well worth the effort, not only in taste, but to see the delight of friends who cut into it, their smiles of pleasure at seeing the treasure within. This book is a Chef's delight....top marks."
3,Cheapo flick.,"A group of drug smugglers are stranded on a deserted oil-rig where they come across the results of unpleasant genetic experiments which have gone out of control.Though hardly a classic (the monster is too comic to be frightening, the acting and script are pretty feeble and Doug Bradley is wasted in a minor and undemanding role), it provides a decent evening's entertainment."
3,"In the middle of the ocean,terror awaits...","I thought this movie was cool,it had lots of action and supence.It also had an interesting monster."
3,"In the middle of the ocean,terror awaits...","I thought this movie was cool,I found the plot tense and exciting,especially the ending.I also liked the monster."
2,"good college textbook, should be cut to 900 pages","Good if you have lots of time to kill, because it has some pages devoted to useless information such as the stupid poem on page 1022 that has nothing to do with accounting. It appears the authors placed lots of ""real world"" trivia that is boring and useless. Entire page of 964 talks about the reason why Coca-Cola will not do business with Lakers because they signed Pepsi spokeman Shaq O'Neill, it has nothing to do with the subject but the extra pages makes you think you got something for the high priced book. If you absolutely need this book, go borrow it from your public library and save your money.The book manuscript was NEVER approved by a CPA or business owner but a long list of college instructors. It does cover all the basics."
4,"What you buy, Is what you get.","I was astonished on how much money i have saved through purchasing this book on amazon, but only if amazon had a order of included accessorized items, such as the publisher's media cd, the personal trainer set, tutor cd, etc. It would probabbly be more expensive together, but money can still be saved besides buying from college bookstore."
1,Kitty,It is very bad. It is not a book. what i received is massed up dirty copy paper with lose pages and i can not return it either because there is no return policy on this guy. Never get reply from this person since i am trying to return my book.
3,Just as promised,Received item just as promised. Thanks for the fast delivery. It came just in time for my class!
3,I have found this book to be a okay for college classes,The book does a alright job of teaching students how to learn accounting. It lacks answers to which could definitly help students. The book's main advantage is that it has many real life examples that help students relate to accounting.
3,Very good text. Clear and concise language.,Very good text. Very clear and concise explanations. I think I may keep this one for future reference. I had to subtract one star because of the price however.
2,Way to complicate things,They make everything so much more complicated than it needs to be. You will probably be more confused than when you started.
5,Not Even The Complete Set yet!,"Other than, ""Devil Woman"", most Americans could not place Cliff Richard. Yet the world is faced with a six CD Box Set with (127) songs that don't even contain his most recent material! This performer is unstoppable even if America has never recognized his amazing talent. This is a fans delight and a piece of musical history with his works from the very first to duets with current and long ago famous artists. This is one of those few Box Sets that truly do justice to the artist. Grab it while you can."
1,Absolute garbage,"A Sonic racing game... normally a good thing. Not Sonic R. Known for being a rushed out game for the failed Sega Saturn, it has poor graphics, strange not fit music, and controls like sandpaper. It is no fun at all, only something to stare at in disgust."
4,"Fun, Classic, and Rare","The Game Itself is a bit frustrating but The Graphics/Scenery are amazing and the Music is just awesome, If you have a Sega Saturn, I would recommend it all the way, Besides Two of SEGA's Forgotten characters made their first and last Appearence in this Game (Spoiler) Metal Knuckles and The Tails Doll, yes, if you've heard of the Tails Doll from the internet, he is real, (well By that I mean hes not fanmade..I mean come on its a floating doll that has a Lifeless expression that looks like tails, and apparently, your not supposed to play the game at 11:00 PM, since 'the Tails Doll will come out of the Game and eat your soul', load of crap I know)"
2,Bad Description,So the motherboard says it has an SATA raid controller... but it doesn't mention that you have to hook up one internal SATA HD and one external to get that functionality. The IDE connector is at the very bottom of the board so good luck getting the provided cable to your optical drives at the top of your computer. The CPU fan connector is far away from the CPU and forces the wires to go over the memory to get there. The board says it has a lot of features but makes sure to make you work to benefit from any of them.My IDE slot didn't even work so I am sending back the board. the 15% restocking fee is worth it. This board is not worth it. Step up to the deluxe for the 60 bucks more. This board is the poorest showing I have seen from ASUS. They were perfect in my mind and have just heavily dropped the ball.
4,"Little Fog Machine that Could, LOL!!!","This little fog machine really works well, I'm using Froggy's Swamp Fog Juice in it at a 60juice/40water % ratio and it puts out very nice fog, my only dislike is the reservoir cap does not seal real good and has pinhole on the top of it I guess for pressure release, who knows, but it will leak when carrying it around or spraying fog manually in side to side or up and down motion when the tank is pretty full, so be sure to check for leakage before and after you plug that puppy in as electricity and water don't mix, LOL!!!"
2,It's not a very good fog machine.,"It takes a while to heat up, drips out the nozzle, and can't even fill a small room with fog.This might be good for special effects on a stage, but it's not good for lasers where you want a foggy room."
3,smoke not thick,"good but not great. the fog from the fog juice that come with the machine is thin and dissipates quickly. you won't get the feeling that you are walking on clouds, but rather, the entire room becomes pretty muggy.also the chemical smell is terrible. it's a bit like those electronic cigarettes for those that tried them. easier to create smoke, but weird, unnatural, and not thick smoke.still kind of fun for light shows."
4,Great!,"Zero complaints. I bought this fog machine for a house party I was having on Halloween and it worked beautifully. The chemical smell was really not bad to my nose. Filled a normal-size living room with fog. You do have to push the button on the remote control every time you want fog. It would be nice if you could just get the machine to do that automatically. Comes with fog juice. There was definitely way more than enough fog juice in the bottle for a night's use. Would recommend for a band playing in small venues but, again, you would need somebody to press the button on the remote. The cable by which the remote is attached to the machine is only a couple feet long. Would be a solid three star item but for only $30 I think it deserves four."
2,"Leaked, loose and ripped hose inside","I have recently purchased 2 units of this item. The first one worked like a charm, so I decided to get another one. This second unit leaked the fog juice after it was filled.After performing an inspection on the inside of the unit, we discover it had a loose hose (reason why it leaked) and the tip of the hose was ripped; so we had to cut off the ripped part of the hose and then place it correctly.At the end, it worked fine, but this is a huge quality control 'oops!'"
3,so so performance,it`s cheap and it did what it could for the cost.................spend a little more and get a better machine would i reccomend a kinda yes 72/100 i would give this machine
1,Never ready when needed,"Waste of money. This unit has to re-cyle and re-heat every minute or so (random) even if it is not spraying smoke. Hitting a ""smoke cue"" is impossible because it is always warmimg up. Then if you are lucky enough to get smoke when needed, it cools off after a few seconds of smoke and has to re-cycle again. Useless design."
1,PIECE OF JUNK! Won't Even Turn On :(,"Well, I ordered this for a film shoot and was excited to try out the machine based on the reviews here. I got the package today and unveiled the item and to my dismay I found droplets of water in the box and on the actual unit. I don't know if it was used or what but the stupid thing wouldn't even warm up or turn on at all. I may have just been one of the unlucky people who received a dud.I'm furious because I rushed ordered this for my shoot and now I'm frantically searching for one to borrow. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!"
1,Doorstop,"Wow, this thing was garbage, pure garbage. It did not come with the switch that it is shown with in the pictures or on the box. I plugged it in and filled it up while I worked around the space to see how it performed. At first just about half a tank... it puffed out a little smoke here and there, but nothing you could even notice if you weren't watching it happen. So I unplugged it an filled the tank up. This seemed to make it fail altogether. I didn't see anymore smoke... at all. Returning it ASAP. Do NOT waste your money on this thing."
4,A great prop for a school play!,"I got this fog machine to donate to my son's school play. The machine did exactly as expected, making lots to fog for the light to shine through in a beautiful and mysterious way. A couple of times during the performances, the ""ready"" light went off on the remote control just before the fog was needed, but the machine delivered anyway. I think this will be used again, for plays and dances. The kids love it!"
1,Dislike,Does not work unless you hold the button down. Not a real good effect when you part of the hollween theme.
3,One time deal,It was ok. Used it for Halloween. At times it didn't work right. It was fun for the night but won't get another.
3,Does the job,"This fogger did the job, but after one use, it was already leaking out the bottom. Make sure you empty it after you use it and keep the box for storage. For the price, I can deal with the extra precautions and clean up."
3,Works very well but it leaks.,"I don't know if I am happy with this product or disappointed??? I guess a little of both. It spits out a lot of fog and does a great job filling a room.... Happy with that. Oh, but it leaks! My son wanted this for his birthday and he leaves it sitting around in random spots. I kept thinking that the dog had an accident on the floor. When I started to smell vanilla sent ""added the sent to the fog juice""... I realized that it was that dang fog machine. Now my son can only use it outside and it leaks all over our porch. That part was disappointing but on a good note I am glad there is a reason to keep it outside because it sets off the smoke alarms in the house."
4,DJ Joey C,It came quick and it was easy to use Looks good. I would recommend it. and I have ;) Price was good to.Make my lazer lights look awesome.
4,works when you use adj juice,"Just received it, i was getting p'd off, because the fog juice that comes with it was disappearing as fast as it was coming out, luckily i bought the american dj juice and it works great. fog just floats everywhere. machine is ok. how come you can't set it to constant on, i don't know. when you want fog, you will have to manually press the on switch."
3,It works but it's spotty,"I bought this for my photography. Fog and smoke is always fun to play around with in pictures. The machine needs time to heat up in order to fog and once it does, it produces decent fog. The issue I have with the machine is that it's not consistent. You have to wait for it to work. It must be a heating element thing but it can be HIGHLY annoying when you have to wait a few minutes for fog to be produced. I don't have experience with more expensive machines but I might suggest spending more and getting something more reliable. This one really isn't."
1,Worked great but broke within 3 months. Only used it a few times.,"Combine this with a Galaxian and you have an awesome light show. The problem is it quit functioning after only a few uses. I tried a new fuse but that didn't help. It's cheap, and it's made cheap. At least that is fitting."
3,Non-starter,Ordered this fog machine and started it up. After about 5 seconds of fog it needed to recycle and never did another batch of fog. Messed with it for about 2 hours and gave up. I guess if it worked it might be a good deal. Minimal instructions. Not impressed.Update --- I did finally get it working by working the nozzel hole with a pin. Apparently something had blocked it. It works good as much as a small machine can.
2,It leaks,"For the price, it generated a nice amount of non-sinking fog. However, I got one of the leaking models. After use, about a cup of fluid would leak out of the base of the machine. This was much more than simples condensation. I returned it."
2,Not for big rooms or gigs: Bedroom and living room appropriate only,"I was sold this by a salesman at a brick and mortar DJ store. It worked well. however was disappointed that you can only fog about once every 5-10 minutes as the fogger needs to reheat to work repeatably. The fog plume will fill a bedroom or living room but that is about it. Hence, will not fill a large room with enough fog unless you continually push and hold down on the remote control fog button.... waiting every 5 minutes too!!! This is NOT good if you are a DJ trying to mix... too distracting. pros: it works as advertised but only for small rooms cons: needs to cycle and need to hold down button to generate fog. Will likely keep and just add another perhaps 700 model or more expensive unit now that I know what foggers are capable of.... I was shown a nice demo of a $300 machine in the store: filled a huge room with fog in like a minute!!!!"
2,Remote controlled only,"Bought this for a halloween haunted house accessory. Unfortunately we found out later that to be used someone has to actually press the button and it can only be done about every 5 minutes. This is pretty inconvenient as we were not planning on sitting their and pressing the button every time someone walked through. A timer or sensor would have been a much needed accessory to this. Price was right, but I would've been happy to pay extra for a little more convenience."
1,Horrible,It leaks horribly. I should have listened to all the other reviews people left. Got a timer for it and it works once and then stops. Wish I would have never bought it.
3,We'll see.......,"Recieved this item today in preparations for a halloween party, upon installation and testing, the unit blew a fuse..Going to buy another fuse to see if it was a random thing, if not, I'll be returning mine.. will update...UPDATE.. Radio Shack carries the correct fuses for this unit, upon changing the fuse the unit works as expected..Leaks a bit while using , so dont stand under it...But most on these things leak anyway.."
1,So much written - yet so little said !,"Regrettably, I feel I cannot justify this book taking up ANY room on my bookshelf. Then I thought of giving it away, but I wouldn't do that to anybody I know.What was he thinking ? Only years of academic study would equip you with enough prentension to understand what he is trying to get at - is he trying to make a point ? I kept reading, hoping for something enlightening, without result.My advise is - Don't waste your time or money !"
2,Disappointing,"It feel that Mr. Sherman is capable of better writing than this rather dubious collection of cerebral flatus. I get the impression that he is trying to prove how clever he is, whilst simultaneously trying to make the reader feel inadequate. The content of his musings range from remarkably insightful to pretentious claptrap. Reading the book is like panning for gold, you have to sort through a great deal of aggregate to find a little gold dust - but it is there if you have the patience.I am not familiar with the author's piano work, but as a student of the instrument I can tell his has considerable knowledge of the subject. His writing however would benefit from a dose of pragmatism, reduction of pretension and condescension.On the whole much is promised but little is delivered."
4,Enjoyed hours of making spaceships,My brother and I enjoyed hours of making spaceships and building characters around the whole space idea. Interesting storyline both for rifts and after the bomb.
2,bleargh.,"unbalanced, with little real game info. mostly just a jumble of numbers (stats on robots and such).. useless junk. and my copy is even signed by kevin siembieda. i don't care, this isn't really useful at all!"
2,disappointing,just a transcript of audience questions at a workshop- does not stand alone - must have read basic NVC books
4,Less Stress,I would recommend this book to anyone who is having a problem communicating. If you are a person who feels misunderstood or find that you say one thing and people hear another. If you want to make your relationships healthy and positive read this book for help. Since reading it my communication skills are so much better as I am able express myself in a positive clear manner.
2,High Expectations Not Met,"After constantly reading and re-reading Non Violent Communication and the workbook, finding tons of valuable information in it and being able to put it into practice, I don't feel this bookLET gave me anything new.First I was unaware this was just a booklet and not a full book , until I got it. It may have declared that in the description but I didn't pay attention!Second, the format of using blurbs from various other participants, seminars and what not makes it very difficult to follow along. I had to stop and was not able to make it all the way through. I jsut had to reread the same passages two and three times just to understand them.That being said I am a college educated, well read individual therefore reading is not a challenge for me, but this booklet was. :-(I had very high expectations for this book after reading NonViolent Communication!"
4,More of the same,"If youve read Rosenberg's main book about NVC you will probably be dissapointed with this purchase. While the product does give some situational advice concerning relationships, it is basically more of the same theory repeated over and over. The first 20 odd pages of the book are ripped directly from any free NVC source, and the rest reads like a Q&A from a seminar (which it basically is). If you want a quick dip into the world of NVC this might be the way to go, but Id go ahead and get a more indepth purchase."
2,Terrible,"This is anything but a practical guide. His core ideas are good (if not original), but they're expressed in a disorganized and pretentious way. The language he suggests using is more suited to a therapist's office than to daily conversation between equals."
5,Very informative!,"While I am not Black or a Muslim, I saw this book back in 1997 and eagerly read it when I worked at the Christian Bookstore in Easton out of curiousity. EVERY Black man & woman should read this book if they or someone in their family or friends is thinking of becoming a Muslim!"
3,Hope you have a lot of free time,"This game takes forever to get into. There is a VERY basic fighting game already programmed in but that won't hold your attention at all. To really enjoy this game, you need to first completely understand all of its functions first. And I'm not talking about a cursory reading of the manual. You really have to know what your doing. You go in and frame by frame program the moves for your character and the opponent. If you're a budding programmer out there who thinks they can challenge the programmers of various fighting games, here's your shot. But it will take you a while."
1,WHY?!!!,"This game is about as much fun as taking a knife and cutting your tongue and swishing rubbing alcohol in your mouth to kill off the germs on your tongue. This is one of my top 10 worst games of all time. I understand it can take some time making a move but it's really not worth it and the results are terrible. I tried to make a simple flip kick and I ended up getting a leg touching the character's face, the head actually reaching on the chest and so forth. Seriously, don't waste your time and money on this piece of crap."
1,Good Idea Poor Job,"When I first heard of this game in my PSM I was excited,PSM warned that the fighting engine sucked ,but I thought it would atleast be at the Atari level. I was wrong. The whole concept of creating your own moves is great but it doesn't matter how good your moves are if the fighting engine can't do its job----by working. I had more fun Playing Karate Champ on Nintendo many years ago. This game has limited opponents, poor graphics, no endings for any of the characters. This game is the worst game I've ever played on the Sony Playstation, possibly any game system."
3,Short - but good. ( like Bolan :} ),"Contains four tracks:- Ride a White Swan; Jeepster; Life's a Gas; and 20th Century Boy ( totaling around 12 minutes ) - All taken from German TV shows in the early 70's, thus the picture quality is pretty good altho' they tended to use psychodelic colours and patterns for this type of artist. Contains switchable on/off ""pop-up"" information 'bubbles' about the artist; and fairly extensive previews for other titles in the series; plus a DVD Jukebox featuring ten live tracks from various artists live dvd's.The sound is 5.1 DD / DTS remixed / enhanced from mono sources."
2,four videos,"great DVD to complete a collection, but there are more comprehensive t-rex dvd's available as this one has only four videos."
5,Going Beyond the Ordinary in Nature Photography,"George Lepp knows nature photography. As the tech guru for OUTDOOR PHOTOGRAPHER magazine and the editor of THE NATURAL IMAGE, he also knows how to write well. For those who know their way around a camera and understand the basics, this book is an excellent reference to launch out and do something out of the ordinary. Lepp covers special topics with written clarity and excellent photographic illustrations. Want to do something unique in butterfly photography? Try eye popping closeups? Use multiple flash units? Create unique flower photographs? Or experiment with cross polarization? All this and much more is here. After exploring the excellent topics in this book, you can try your hand at more great photo techniques in volume two. The same clear teaching techniques that come across in Lepp's seminars and workshops are also in both of these books. Highly recommended."
5,I'm a skeptic and even I can't ignore the talent-,"It's a very good CD- but clearly only the start of bigger things to come. The style and vocals presented make it unmistakable that CherryFix and Alana have talent on a truly uncommon scale. If they were a stock, I'd buy as many shares as possible. This is not hype, one or more of them will be stars in the near future."
2,so-so wanna be,"saw them at the mall. nice ,butthey sound like they want to be no doubt.but not even close."
1,what happened???,i got a free disc at one of their shows a while back and then i got this one and it sux!it's not even the same singer... what happened to cherry? definately do not reccommend this cd.
5,<3 Cherryfix <3,"I bought this cd last month when I saw the band play in Hagerstown. This cd is amazing and has exactly what you're looking for from the upbeat tune of ""One Bitter Ending"" to the slow, sweet melody of ""No One Knew."" The lead singer, Alana, shows off her strong and wonderful vocal talents with the backup of her bandmates: Tim, Dondi, Dan and Joe accompanying her with smooth, flowing and catchy tunes. Other songs on this cd include ""Love's Just a Waste,"" ""Just Fine"" and ""Hold My Breath,"" which are all sure to please your music appetite. Cherryfix is a band that is *REAL* with amazing lyrics and music. They will wow you over and leave you wanting more so, be sure to check out their music and purchase this cd.<3 Rachel <3"
5,We Love You in France!,"Greetings,We just recieve cd here in Paris and we love you. My entire school is a Cherryfix fan. Come to perform soon.Peace and LoveLatafla,Paris,France"
5,Teh awesome Cherryfix,Hey everyone! I saw Cherryfix live and they flippin' rock <3 Their CD is awesome and so is their music style. After I saw them live I became hooked and I can't wait to meet them again =D~Heather Salkow =3
5,"Tighest, High Energy Big Band Album Ever..","This album literally burns - with some of the most hard and complex charts ever recorded. Rich and Band make it seem easy, like a well-oiled machine but musical. A showcase triumph of a gem in Rich's crown, his best album ever, from the opening""Ya Gotta' Try"" (by the late great Sammy Nestico) all the way through - what a set! Only the chart ""Kong"" is out of place here, but still fun and energetic.I orginally bought this on LP when it first came out and have been looking for the complete CD for years - paid a hefty price to get the recently remastered import version but it's well worth it. How many recordings like this are there? Far to few.And the sound is incredible. If you only have 1 Rich album, this is the one to get (I have nearly all, and this one is that good)! Enjoy!Ed WatersRocky Mount, NCSept. 11, 2009"
4,Nordic Grooves,"Better than average icy (mostly) instrumental funk in the so-called chillout style. Look it's either good or it's not. These cool beats are entertaining without seeming repetitive, organic and varied - and they don't all sound as if they came from either the same studio or computer chip. There's a cinematic Ennio Morricone-ish feel to tracks 2 & 3, complete with the requisite whistle. 4 cuts of good background."
2,Wrong title for book,"Should have been, titled how to custom airbrush. Not enough technical information the types of paint lacquer, urethane, clears, candies, flakes and the like. Also it felt like a big advertisement for Sato Paint Guns and House of Kolor. I am sure there must be better sources for this information."
3,Not quite what I thought...,"Although I found it interesting, expecially her lifes' story in the beginning, the book wasn't exactly what I thought it would be about. In the beginning and for the 1st few chapters, it seemed to be more about how she, the author, custom paints motorcycles more so than you ""learning"" how to custom paint motorcycles, albeit in a book. The photos were great and the occassional hints she adds throughout the book made it for pretty good reading and informative, nonetheless."
4,Precious Scraps of a Historic Time,"""Kick Out The Jams"", with it's jerky footage and for the most part, overdubbed audio, could disappoint the neophyte who has just become aware of the MC5.But, for us who were there, in 1969, it is manna from heaven. Having been in NYC at that time, and seen their 8 shows at Ungano's, the apocolyptic performances at the NY State Pavilion with the Stooges, and the frightening mess at the Fillmore, this disc is a wonderful link to the past.The MC5 were the prototype heavy metal band, the prototype punk band, the inspiration for every garage band, and the definition of High Energy. Anyone who was in their presence knew the power of their performances. They were as important as any rock band in existence. And, it is a shame that they weren't better documented.With this CD and a little imagination, you can experience the power, commitment, energy and fun of the rock band you always wished you were in.There will never be any band like them."
1,Can I give this zero stars?,"I love the MC5 as much as anyone but this is ridiculous. I knew before I bought this that the audio and the video were not synced up; however, I thought that I would get 30 minutes of raw live footage of the MC5. WRONG! This DVD has maybe five minutes of live footage of the MC5 that has been annoyingly sped up, slowed down, colorized, looped, etc. This is absolutely and totally worthless. Just when you think Music Video Distribution can't sink any lower something like this comes out. Is this John Sinclair's attempt to destroy the legacy of the MC5 or cash in on the legacy of the MC5 at any cost?"
2,Some tantilizing live footage....BUT...,"There are enough spectacular glimpses of the MC5 performing (and also what I believe to be the entire ""video single"" that Elektra released to promote ""Kick Out the Jams"") to more than justify the purchase of this DVD, but the repetition of non-band clips, the annoyingly dated Joshua-light-show-style psychedelia, and way too much accent on the political and philosophical cult of John Sinclair quickly gets old. Lets all hope that Wayne and Michael and Dennis (the surviving members of the band) will someday allow the release of ""A True Testimonial,"" a truly reverent and lasting documentary of the MC5's history with more and better concert performances."
1,MC5: MTV-style,"First off I enjoy Leni's photos and always will. Her film making talents were OK as home movies, but this mish-mash with some 3 or 4 different bootleg recordings is a bit much. At best there are about 12 minutes of the 5 here, but with reverses, color drops and posterizations she was able to milk it out for about a half hour. A simple one shot run through with commentary by the remaining members would be fine. The sound is the best we can ever hope to get as well, but a single source would have been sufficient. The bonus feature with John is a bit embarrassing. If that's how he wants to be remembered, fine. I've seen him doing poetry readings and talked with him on occasion but this is sad. As someone once said, there's nothing worse than an aging hipster."
1,Junk,"This dvd is a piece of crap the people who put this togethershould dig a hole and jump in it. I would like to make them eatit as well. what a rip off I will be happy to use this dvd fortarget. I'm so sick of crap like this do not buy this dvd it's ajoke all crap and then some I hate rip off jerks like you.Done, and take off!J."
3,For Hardcore fans only...,"I've never heard the other Folsom Prison/ San Quentin recordings, but one thing I know fairly certainly is that they are live recordings. This CD isn't. It has some good Johnny Cash songs on this album, but they are different to the ones on theAt Folsom Prisonalbum and none of them have the magic of his other songs or of a live performance.To be fair, there are some good songs on here (e.g.Cry Cry Cry,I Walk the Line,Ballad of a teenage queen,Katy TooandI Love You Because). If you have tried some Johnny Cash before, or if you're feeling experimental, then this album is worth trying.However, if you're after one of the finest Live albums of all time. then this is not it. It lacks the charm and the tunes, and your money is probably better spent on the real deal (At Folsom PrisonorAt San Quentin: Remastered)..."
4,"Cool, violent Mexican jungle adventure","Clearly inspired by the original ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" this 1985 Mexican jungle adventure adds in chess played by mental telepathy, Arab bad guys, a hot jungle princess (Rocio Espada - that's her on the cover of the video and yes, she actually looks that good in a metal bikini, maybe better) and ancient flying saucers - predating the 4th Indiana Jones movie by more than two decades!"
5,Sparkling!,"This recording is a reminder of what a great pianist Wynton Kelly was. He sparkles and shines everytime his fingers hit the keys. He is the perfect match for Cannonball's jaunty alto sax. Bassists Paul Chambers and Percy Heath and drummers Jimmy Cobb and Tootie Heath do their swinging things throughout. It is inevitable to compare this CD with another great Cannonball quartet recording, ""Know What I Mean?,"" featuring pianist Bill Evans. ""Cannonball Takes Charge"" definitely holds it own!"
1,Underhanded!,Don't buy this version! This cd has something in it that prevents ripping it into iTunes. If like me you have all your music in your computer and hence don't have a stereo you're screwed!Cannonball Takes Charge
1,Is it a toner or a LCD Monitor?,"I am confused about this product. It says a black toner as per Amazon and every where else it indicates that this product is indeed a LCD monitor ""Videoseven E17PS (White) 17 inch LCD Monitor"" I can not order something and receive something else."
4,"California, End of the earth","I'm taking a class from one of the guys who compiled the book, and for starters let me say twenty bucks is a damn good deal for a textbook. This one is meaty too. Very interesting prefaces for each selection of writing, as well as essays about each period. A must for anyone curious about Mythic California and the writers who, well, wrote about it. Great stuff by Twain and other biggies. My favorite pieces are those giving a glimpse into Californian mining camps. The one downfall of this book is that it would have been difficult interpreting the native american stories had I not been takeing a class concurrently. The essays written by the editors about the decimation of the native population, the subsequent eviction of Mexicans were much more insightful than the native pieces themselves. There are also pieces by descendants of native peoples, which give insight."
2,My review,"When I came across this book as a kid I found it so boring I didn't bother to finish reading it. The secret in the closet was not enough to carry the story, and there was nothing else in the plot I found engaging or exciting."
3,GIVE THIS A LISTEN.,"Decent album...live show is even better. This band has alot of potential. If I could give them one piece of advice, it would be to create a little more of a unique sound that would set them apart from all the other rock groups of today. As catchy as some of their tunes are, I just can't imagine them standing out on the radio. Good first album though...And they are the friendliest bunch of guys you will ever meet. Enjoy!"
3,Quite good!,"I came across this album in an used-record shop in Bergen. From Satellite was a band I had never heard of before, so I listened to them for just a minute and bought the album.This record is all about rock,it seems like these guys want nothing more that to play their music. And their music is good! Listen to ""Fall to pieces"", and all following track for that sake, and I am sure you will like it. The three first track seem a bit toned down, a litle more quiet than the rest. But when From Satellite let loose toward the end of the album, then they are really good! I am trying to compare this band with some others, but I can't think of any right now. But if you like some of these bands, Radford - Epic Hero - Oleander - Greenwheel, you'll probably like From Satellite as well.Recommended!"
3,For those who just wants to know,It is informative. It is a helpful guide for those who would like to know how Christmas is celebrated elsewhere.
1,Poor Video Production,"Whatever artistic merits this Anna Karenina DVD might have, they are severely marred by the extremely poor picture quality. Most of the movie's scenes are dark, and the figures in the night scenes can hardly be distinguished. We had to stop watching. A big disappointment."
1,Anna Karenina,"If you have seen the Russian production by Central Partnership u will not even put this in your player, or if you do then you will immediately remove it. Abysmal."
3,Meh,Good not great Vronsky should not be blonde and fatHelen McGlory is excellent.This version is not my fave.
3,Great first step for Louis,"Very well done remaster of Louie's early work, all time favorites, not enough Kiely!good investment, shipper did remarkable job of getting product out quickly!Only disc I would reccomend more is the Capitol records Collector's series.Collector's has absolutely top notch sound. Buy it first for grand overviewand incredible early sound."
3,Nice unit but lacks bass,"The overall Quality is very good.The radio, tape player and CD player are all very good given the low cost of the unit. The bass boost does nothing but increase the overall volume at low listening levels.At low volume levels there is very little bass, but the bass gets better as the volume goes up.Overall,considering the low price, it seems to fill the niche as my six year old's first boombox very well."
3,"Nice features, but poor sound","When we opened the box we were quite impressed. It looked nice, the CD had some nice features... but, in the end, we were very disappointed. The sound was very tinny. THe 'boost' button didn't work. This purchase was to replace another low cost boombox whose CD had crapped out, That box at least had good sound."
2,Plain Comet or Ajax in the can is much more effective and cost friendly!,"When I bought this product, I thought, because I use Comet in the can mostly for sinks, that this would be a good purchase because you just spray it and scrub.But...no matter how hard I scrub, it doesn't do the job half as well as the the powder no matter how hard I scrub or what kind of sponge I use.Don't waste your money!"
1,THIS IS ART????/,"What these men do is not art, it is junk. Real art is Picasso, Renoir, Rodin, Ansel Adams etc... Since this is not art,logically any book about ""the gates"" is a waste of money. Anybody who thinks that what this book shows is art should look up the word pretentious."
2,Maybe I'm Too Messy. . .,"Let's see. Spilled coffee. Rust stains that dripped off a plumber's snake. Concord grape juice. A pet's ""accident"". And that's just off the top of my head as I recall the various carpet stains I've tried to resolve by using, er, RESOLVE SPOT & STAIN CARPET CLEANER.Well, this cleaner is consistent. . .in that it consistently doesn't lift the stains out. The directions are simple enough: Spray the stain, let it soak for at least a minute, wipe up with a damp (and clean) cloth. While I will give this product some credit for lifting a portion of the color out, it still doesn't remove the stain. As they say in the law enforement vernacular, the evidence remains.So if it's complete stain removal you're after, PROFESSIONAL (yeah, okay) RESOLVE SPOT & STAIN CARPET CLEANER is going to come up short. But in all fairness, I've yet to find any carpet cleaner on the market that effectively removes stains. I guess I'm just too messy. Hand me that cranberry juice.--D. Mikels, Esq."
3,Removes stains/ odor but leaves a residue,"We have three kids and a dog so we have been using Resolve for years with success. However, this is the first time we purchased the ""professional"" grade Resolve and it is terrible. It removes what we need it to but leaves a stiff white residue on the carpet. I have to go over the area with a soaking wet rag to remove it.We will stick to regular old household grade Resolve in the future."
3,"Better than many, not as good as some...","As far as compilations go, Acosta's Awake is energetic and lively, but simply presents the same big trance anthems we've heard about ONE MILLION TIMES. Acosta went very commercial with this release, which is a big mistake, educated ravers and progressive music fans beware - this one's for the weekend clubber who thinks ATB is a quality progressive producer."
5,Wake Up!,Anyone who doesn't give this CD 5 stars either doesn't understand or can't appreciate true epic trance. I've been a trance/dance fan for 10 years and there is no CD I turn to more than George Acosta's Awake. Matt Darey's Euphoria is the only rival I can think of for absolute climax power. If you want your trance to rock you from start to finish then this is the CD for you. It's both beautiful and hard at the same time with a great mix of heavy beats to go along with floating melodies. Awake is a journey that can't be broken up into track analysis. The CD has to be experienced as a whole and true fans won't want to hear it any other way. Awake is a masterpiece.
3,"Monotonous yes, trance no","I was really disappointed in this CD. I was looking for something trance like, along the lines of Digweed, Sasha, or even Claude Young. George Acostas's skills as a DJ are clearly evident. He does a great job. But the track selection was really boring, almost eurotrash. I'm sure I would have enjoyed this show live at a club, but it lacks the depth, complexity, and creativity to make me want to listen to the CD more than once."
1,A Collection Of Today's Anthems,"I figured that since I live and club in Miami, I should check out the latest release by a well known local D.J.I quickly found that I couldn't listen to the whole thing through. This album is very repetitive, and becomes boring after the first 5-6 songs. Not to mention that I have heard all of the songs on this album before. This type of Trance tends to be a quest to see how many different patterns and rhythms one synthesizer voice can be used. Also on this album is the cheesiest breakbeat that I have ever heard. Haven't you people ever heard of Sasha?"
1,Too much noise!,"This CD is one of the worst I have ever picked up. I would not recommend this CD to ANYONE. If you want good Progressive music pickup anything Danny Howells, Anthony Pappa, Parks and Wilson, Chris Fortier, Jimmy Van Mellegham, and of course Sasha and Digweed."
1,Avoid at all costs!,"This is the cheesiest mix I have ever heart. Unoriginal track selection, unimpressive mixing, and piss-poor programming make this a terrible CD. What kind of a-hole puts ATB on a cd with his name on it? For real trance, try any of the Global Underground/Nu Breed series (except for Paul Oakenfold)."
1,doesn't work,"after having two separate watches sent, neither of which worked on arrival, it is safe to say, i would never order this product again. it was a time-wasting paperwork headache. amazon should pull the product from its shelves. amazon seems to take no pride in sending products that have been tested for function."
5,Be Aware,This is a wonderful book to learn basic Bible Truths. However the publishers of this book do not support it being bought online. If you wish to obtain a copy ask Jehovah's Witnesses in your area or write to 25 Columbia Heights Brooklyn NY 11201You can then obtain a free copy.
3,judy collins wildflower festival,"this concert video shot during collin's last tour provides a nice overview of the legendary's folk/art singer's career. the guests: arlo guthrie, eric anderson and tom rush play pleasant short sets as well as join judy for the encores. it all looks great, the production values are fine. the second dvd of extras is largely extraneous. this dvd gets docked one star as collins has coasted on her history here and the dvd does little in the way of conveying what has made collin's such a trailblazing artist all these years. still, a nice package."
1,Don't Buy!,"I bought this speaker and it sounded pretty good once installed. That's about the only thing that it did well. I don't know what classifies a speaker to be marine rated but this one was not. The first splash of water that got on it ruined it. Once the very small splash got on it, it started cutting in and out. I thought that there must have been a wire loose or something so I took it out when I got home and the cone was detached. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Scares the fish,"Installed this subwoofer under the seat in a 95 Caravelle with a 1500w amp. Hits clean at max volume with no distortion (you will need to build a box for this). You can see the water ripple when beached,and feel the pulse under the water!"
2,Ok subwoofer,This subwoofer is ok. It distorts a lot when you crank up the volume. That's what happens when you pay $50 for a subwoofer.
4,saiint thomas iz klueless,"for one this cd speaks for itself. anyway, saiint thomas recommendz, hymez ov thee worlock beye skiiny puppy. it iz not even a skinny puppy album, it is a tribute. and filth pig beye ministry? any one will agree that filth pig iz probabli their weakist realess. so get a clue, and know your fakts. you know nothiing about iindustrial musik and the fakt that you never heard ov pig face provez this az fakt."
5,Very Strong...,"I first heard Meg Lee Chin on 3wk net radio. I was looking for something different and new and she fit the bill. I was unprepaired by how good this disk is, though. If you're tired of the same-old same-old, this is definately worth a listen."
3,Pretty good first solo album,"I first heard of Meg Lee Chin on the Ministry tribute when she covered ""Scarecrow"". So I figured I would try to find her solo cd. Overall, it's alright, some good beats and decent mixing, but it just seemed too poppy for someone who had such a great goth-like cover of a ministry song. I'm not too positive if she is from Britain or lives there now, but her music definately shows some influence of british techno in her music. Hopefully her next album will adventure into the goth sound she had on ""Scarecrow""."
4,Not the best but pretty good,"Ok- I think Nigel Calders book is better- but I like this book to. The writer has a good style. I particularly like the troubleshooting checklists, that are orgainized from most likely cause to least likely. Also has some good decision making flow charts. I think there is a lot of practical information here presented in an easy to read style. It is one of the two diesel books I always refer to. Would I buy again? YES"
2,"Compton's book covers the basics, but barely","I bought Compton's book based on an ad in [...], a rather heavy duty marine diesel oriented web site. I already had Nigel Calder's marine diesel book and was somehow expecting more, but got less.Calder's book is more detailed and thorough. If you have Calder's, then you don't need Compton's. So, my advice is to get Calder's marine diesel book instead."
4,Useful,This book does exactly what it promises. Put it alongside your engine whilst doing your maintenance and repair jobs and it saves a lot of hassle.
2,Disappointed,"If you know anything at all about diesel engines or have used a diesel engine for a couple of years, don't waste your money on this book. Genaric, superficial, of little value to me."
3,Good overall information on Yanmar Diesels,"I specifically purchased this book for the information on Yanmar diesels. I was not disappointed, but later found a factory type manual that was much better and also a source for Yanmar parts. I think I will closely compare both manuals to see if I will resell this or not. I would still give this three stars."
4,Well done but a change in tone,"As other reviews have stated, this latest collection is well written but less funny than Mr. Ford's previous titles. Don't expect a duplicate of the earlier books.I enjoyed the read very much (knocked it off in two sittings), and there was humor. But it was not the laugh out loud humor of his three earlier books. Where the first three were hilarious with a few more serious or touching essays thrown in, this fourth collection is the reverse - predominantly serious, thoughtful or sentimental with a few chucklers mixed in for good measure.It's still head and shoulders above most so-called contemporary ""gay"" writing. Michael Thomas Ford exposes his thoughts, feelings and life. And when he's funny, he's a riot. At this point, after four books, I feel like I know him, and I like him, I really like him."
3,Hmmm...,"I realized after reading Augusten Burrough's ""Magical Thinking"" and Ford's ""The Little Book of Neuroses"" and the like that I'm not really a fan of collections of witty/humorous essays and personal stories. I guess because I expect all the essays to crack me up. So far, I've yet to read a book that has made me laugh from front to back (...yet).""Neuroses"" was an entertaining read. Some were hilarious, some serious and some thought-provoking. I found myself laughing at some parts. I also found myself nodding in agreement as if Ford read my mind, such as gays in monogamous relationships.It's worth a read and perhaps you'll laugh more than I did."
1,Incredibly disappointing--both dull and stagnant,"I have been a fan of Michael Thomas Ford's previous three Queer Life books, and was incredibly disappointed by this latest offering. Rarely have I read a book and felt that an author had nothing to say, but that an anxious agent was forcing him to write anyway. That's the exact feeling I got from this. In addition to a lot of amateurish fillers along the line of a Cosmo Quiz (Are you a Drama Queen? Are you a Leather Man?), Ford whines and drones with no significant insight into either his own life or the lives of gay men in general (I mean, really, does the fact that a lot of gay men diet really break new ground?). The book does offer a few solid stories, but readers looking forward to Ford's latest will be sorely disappointed. It lacks both the humor and wit of his earlier works, and really is one of the most strained and forced pieces of writing I've read in years. When funny ain't funny it's deadly, and most of this book is funny that ain't funny."
2,Very poor design,"I chose this highchair because I heard great things about the Zooper brand in general, it was easy to wipe down, and I just liked how it looked. Well, I am very unhappy with it. The tray is too high. My 8-month-old daughter can't use the tray because she can't get her arms over the top to reach for her Cheerios. This is a real problem because she's at the age where she needs to practice picking things up. Also, the tray doesn't push in far enough, so it's too far away for her. I thought I was doing something wrong, but after reading other on-line reviews on this product, lots of people are having the same problem. Zooper is apparently ""aware of the problem"". Steer clear of this highchair..."
3,Not Bowie's Best But Still Worth Having,"In Bowie's stunning career, he has jumped genres and even reinvented them constantly. This finds him entering new territory again, but with mixed results. THe first half of the album is pretty good, certainly listenable. ""7 Years in Tibet"" is the only track on the album though that is really great. The title track is one of the weakest Bowie tracks ever recorded, almost on par with something off of NEver Let Me Down. NOntheless, if you are as a big a Bowie fan as I am, you will find things to like about this album and will even enjoy some parts of it. If you want to check out modern Bowie and don't know where to start though, Heathen, Outside, Hours, and Reality are all recommended above this. Heathen is especially good, in fact it's one of the best albums anyone has recorded this decade (though considering how bad most albums have been by most artists that may not seem like saying much)."
2,Club/Techno Music...eck!!!,"Like many other people that have reviewed this album I'm an avid Bowie fan and find something to enjoy in most all of his albums. But I detest club/techno music as much as I detest rap music. Had I read the one negitive review regarding this album I may have saved myself six dollars. You can add all the distorded power chords you want to these songs but it essentially comes down to the mechanical sound of a drum machine and synthizers. The year was 1997 and U2 tried a similar experiment with 'Pop' and failed as well. You can't fault Bowie for continualy trying to re-invent himself but this was an experiment I could have lived without.Alas all is not lost, there are a few highlights here 'Seven Years in Tibet' and 'I'm Afraid of Americans' are good examples of what can happen when Techno/Pop/Rock are morphed into one song. Hence two stars and not one."
2,The Art of the Party,"Renny Reynolds is a talented designer. I own his first book published in 1992 by Viking Studio Books entitled ""The Art of the Party, Design Ideas for Succesful Entertaining"". While browsing through Amazon, I discovered a more recent book by Mr. Reynolds published in March 2003 by Gibbs Smith in Salt Lake City. Although the name was similar, the publisher and publication date as listed were different. Upon receiving the ""new"" book, I was surprised to find the EXACT same book published in 1992 with a new book jacket and fly pages. What a disappointment. The pictures and ideas are dated; if you want up to the minute new ideas, do not order this book. I attended parties in the 90's that used these very themes. Why order the new book when you can have the old one with dated ideas much cheaper."
5,The best of the best!,This is the best entertaining book I have ever seen. Not to mention the gorgeous photography. Each section goes thru the most important aspects of having a party and the things that must go into it. You will love this book!
3,The last good Horror,"Aenigma is probably Fulci's last good horror flick. The story is a cross between ""Patrick"" and ""Carrie"". Some scenes are well staged and even if the story sometimes don't make sense there is enough horror and gore to satisfy any Fulci's fan. The film is set in America but was shoot in former Yugoslavia"
2,Completely overpriced!,"The movie itself would have deserved between 3 and 4 stars.It is a fairly well directed version of the ""Carrie"" story.Its blue tone and setting in a girl's boarding school arereminiscent of Dario Argento's ""Phenomena"". It features somemacabre and bizarre deaths in the Fulci style.Image's release is, unfortunately, rather meager ....On the positive side, there is the transfer. Apart from occasional variations in color, it is sharp and colorful.The first disappointment is the sound. Only a poor, monauralenglish track is featured. No subtitles at all. This iscomplemented by the total absence of bonus material. There are not even any interesting liner notes. ....If ""Aenigma"" is the last item missing in your Fulci collection,you may wish to go for this release, otherwise I recommend youto check out some of the more interesting releases of Fulcititles."
2,aenigma,"i've seen a lot of lucio fulci's films and this is easily one of the worst! might be cause he does have a lot of great films but this one just gets ridiculous halfway through the movie. maybe worth a rent but definitely not a buy. stick to movies like City of the living dead, the beyond, new york ripper and other great italian films. this one's not very entertaining and does slow down in parts. only recommend if you are a very big lucio fan"
4,Using Math in the real world,Anno's Magic Seeds is yet another book written by Mitsumasa Anno that integrates literature with mathematics. This book is a useful tool for teachers attempting to provide a connection of math in the real world for their students. The story is enchanting and it certainly proved to be a creative way for beginning a math lesson- atleast it was for my 4th graders! I highly recommend this or any of Anno's books to stimulate children's interest in mathematics!
3,I give it a 3.5,"Sure, this book is real cute, but it is missing something. It is strange, and my nephew wasn't thrilled by it. I bought it for his because of his obsession with seeds. It is no run of the mill book, but it could do better"
3,Digital Blue American Idol Digital Camcorder - 510,The camera works great. My daughter really enjoyed it. The one complaint I have is there is no easy way to contact their tech support for assistance because the CD that came with it does not install the driver fort he camcorder correctly. Luckily my daughter had a friend who purchased this same camcorder about 8 months prior and the CD that came with it had an earlier software version and driver and we were able to complete the installation.
1,WHAT THE...,"ok, everyone: I didn't buy this, but it is the exact same thing as the digital blue that was for sale in earlier years! I have the digital blue, and it the exact same camera exept for the logo!!! Sinse it wast made by intel like the D.B was, isn't that plagarism?"
3,A LITTLE MUCH,"I have to give Manso credit for the exhausting research that must have gone into this book. Brando is a fascinating man, but who cares how many abortions he paid for. Leave these people some of their dignity, at least. I'm a huge fan of Brando's work, but this book goes a little too far. But, hopefully readers will conclude that nothing can diminish the impact this man had on society and the acting world. All actors owe something to Marlon Brando."
3,Could of been shorter,"This is a VERY detailed account of Brando. I can't say that i even believed alot of the details in here, manso seems to make a LOT of conclusions about Brando without and supporting evidense.But some of the details he gives are just downright boring after a while. I became very bored and skipped ahead in the book 50 pages....and it felt like i missed nothing at all: Brando studies to be an actor....Brando has sex with her her and her.Also he seems to go into a lot of detail about the people in Brando's life. I was always thinking ""so what about this person....i bought a book about Brando"".All and all, it had a lot of good ""facts"". I cant say i believe a good portion of it, but interesting stuff. Definatly could of been about 100-200 pages shorter though."
2,Missed some interesting stories,"Mr. Manso researched this book for ten years and apparently forgot to mention Marlon Brando's involvement with ""Rebel Without A Cause"". He either did a screen test for it or shot scenes which were not used (the footage can be seen in the special edition of ""Streetcar""). It's interesting stuff and even includes a brief interview with a shy Brando between takes. After I saw the footage, I looked up ""Rebel"" in the Manso book. He completely ignored it! Poor research or poor judgement, I say."
3,ok,Manso spent almost ten years on this book and it's already out of print??? Poor s.o.b. It's a mixed bag. A lot of it is interesting. But Brando in his autobiography says he lost his virginity at age 19. This book says he lost it a lot earlier. Guys do not lie about losing their virginity LATER than they did. So you know Manso got that wrong! So it makes you wonder what else he got wrong.And I happen to know someone who is mentioned in this book in some spots. That person told me that each incident related is incorrect!
5,Music To My Ears,"Music to my ears and all my other senses as well!This is my second purchase after The Live at Red Rocks first buy. Blown away again, what can I say.It is a unique acoustic experience. What I would really appreciate would be seeing John Butler and Bruce Cockburn together, that would be an acoustic explosion heard around the world. Two men, unique but with similar styles and both with a profound respect for our world and its people.Great party music."
1,Returned,"The cartridge must be super old as it did not work when I put it into the printer, ugh what a waste!"
4,Smith Corona 21000 Correctable Typerwriter Ribbon,"That's what I needed and it was the right Ribbonfor my Smith Corona Typerwriter. I got the H Seriesat the Store,and it does not work."
5,Met My Needs,I was given an electric typewriter a few years back and was afraid I wouldn't be able to find replacement ribbon for it. Amazon to the rescue! This is exactly the tape I needed - it arrived very quickly after I ordered and works perfectly in my typewriter.
4,Open to believe,Why does God favor some and not others? This seems to be the question this movie asked. The movie is not preachy but seems to be made with a wider audience in mind. Miracles real or auto-suggested? This movie leaves it open to your own belief. I choose to believe in the miracle. I really liked the movie and did not find it anti-catholic as one reviewer suggested.
1,a grand opera of bigotry,"Another venomous portrayal by the shallow ignorant airheads of filmmaking that presents the religious as shallow, ignorant, simple-minded, jealous, depraved, grotesquely selfish, and hysterically deluded about the existence of miracles. Buy this video if you're an unconscionable, airheaded anti-Catholic bigot. This applies even to Catholic anti-Catholic bigots. You'll love it."
4,Very Good Information,This is a good book for the basics of futures trading. It has a lot of the basicterms and information you need to get a quick edge in trading. Will it be the lastand only book you buy on futures? Probably not! This is a good start that willpeak your curiousity. I recommend it.
5,My brother trades energy futures,I thought I might do some speculative investing so I bought this book. I thought it is was very educational (and even entertaining). I ended up giving it to my brother and he said it was an excellent resource. He works for a wholly owned subsidiary of RBS and is very successful.
1,Rod Stewart EP,THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST DVDS I HAVE EVER SEEN. I PURCHAS AT LEAST 50 MUSIC VIDEO DVDS A YEAR AND HAVE NEVER GOT ONE THIS BAD...IT SUCKED!
3,"adjustable, but not very","Strong and good lookin', but not very adjustable; you only really get 3 levels. It worked for our application, but I wouldn't order 'em again."
1,"Too heavy, pinch-points, major bolt failure","I agree these are too heavy, have bad pinch-points at the ends, and are sometimes damage-creating themselves. I rarely use them and turn to plastic sawhorses for most work. After about 4 years the main bolt threads somehow became stripped so one is out of commission. I can't find the manufacturer so no replacement bolt available."
1,Poor quality,"With the Crawford name, I was hoping these might be decent quality, but they aren't. Even @ the reduced price of $34.54 per pair, it's more of the same MADE IN CHINA stuff; when set up, they wobble on the long axis, which might be a safety issue and when folded, they're difficult to carry when the legs keep folding open... poor tolerances. Sorry, but I wouldn't buy another pair of these even if they were $20 per. If you expect quality and work for the money you spend, find a Tote-A-Horse sawhorse dealer (Fulton Corp) and buy something MADE IN USA. Tote-A-Horse came out with their folding sawhorses over a decade ago and were most likely what the Chinese Crawfords were copied from."
5,The Real Alchemy,"The real secret of Alchemy was discovered by the Knights Templar and this knowledge has been kept by Freemasons who used that knowledge to build America.But, the secret is not in turning base metal into gold; the secret is to turn a paper note (with a lot of ""magic"" symbology) into a representation of wealth that is accepted by everyone.The success of this trick lies in getting everyone to believe in the magic.Tracy Twyman explains the way this all works out. You'll think about it every time someone hands you a dollar."
1,Sick,"The picture towards the end of the book could not have been Jimmy. #1 I don't think he would ever do that, #2 if it was really him wouldn't we have seen it by now? His friends denied it also. That picture was disgusting and uncalled for, along with the ""stories"" of his ""homosexuality"". I went to his hometown last July and I met several people who knew him personally. When asked, ""What was Jimmy like?"" One woman said, ""Jimmy was all boy."" I think that answered my question. Meeting people who knew him, and seeing his hometown you could almost feel him there. It's time that people need to stop trying to profit from this poor guy by saying he's gay. It's crazy."
5,WHOAAAA!!!!,"I knew pratically nothing about James Dean's life besides he was hot, so this book was very insighting and throughly shocking when Alexander continously arises questions on Dean's sexuality. Some of the scenes are so descriptive that its easy to concluded that most likely the author's own amourous feelings towards Dean most likely plays a role in the writing of this book.Oh, NAKED PIC OF JAMES DEAN IN THE BOOK!!!!!!!!! :o) FOR THAT IT GETS 5 STARS ALONE!! lol"
3,mostly about james dean's sexual life,"short and sweet:this book is about james dean's birth,life,and death but,it has alot of emphasis on whetheror not james was a homosexual. the author actually puts himself in the room with james when james was witha male lover(!). other than that,the author does pick apart james psyche trying to get to the root of theproblems that james suffered(if indeed he had any) and it does give somewhat an understanding of the jamesdean we never knew(in private) VS the james dean we see on the screen. ***as a side note,there a some niceblack and white photos of james and others but,be forewarned***there is a nude photo at the end of the bookand it looks like james in all his naked male glory:)"
4,Interesting book,"This is the first book I've read about James Dean. It is very interesting and sometimes disturbingly erotic. If all accounts are accurate, then he led a whirlwind, albeit short, life. I would suggest it for anyone even mildly interested in this legendary actor."
2,More of the usual subjective perception and creative projection,"Jimmy biographies often say as much about the writer as they do about their subject. Books by women with whom he had affairs often suggest he was primarily straight; books by gay men often suggest he was essentially gay. The fact of the matter is, he had an equal number of sexual relationships with men and women so if we're to be intellectually honest, we have to say he was bisexual. Anything beyond that is personal projection and that type of projection is in evidence a lot in this book. Unless you've read a LOT of biographies (as I have over thirty-five years of Dean fandom), it would be hard to know where Jimmy leaves off and the author's sexual fantasies begin. But it's not nearly as badly written as some other similar biographies are."
1,Wishful Thinking,"As a dedicated Dean fan since the age of 5, having read many pieces about the actor, including this one, I would say that this book is very slanted towards the author's POV. Also, having known a fair number of performers personally, it is fair to say that many people in the world of show business are rather flexible regarding sex. As far as Dean's preference, nothing has been proven by this cut & paste job. Anyway, what's the big deal about it? Would it have made him a better man or actor if he had been gay or straight? It just looks like the author is saying, ""Yay for us!"" If the author would reflect on the glories of being gay, is he proud of the fact that the Rev. DeWeerd was a sexual predator & pedophile?"
4,godzilla vs mecagodzilla,all godzilla movies are good if your a fan i got my grandson is hooked on them he watches the all the time when he vists me
3,A kid's review,It's a very nice movie and the music is nice in it. Kiru looks is excellent. So is Godzilla with his blue fire.I gave it three stars because Kiru is too aggressive in it and I didn't like that.
3,The original is much better,This is by no means a bad Godzilla movie but I will say that I feel that the original MechaGodzilla is much better. Definitely not one of my favorites but get it for the sake of having it in your collection.
3,Godzilla fan,"I am an advid G-Fan. I love Godzilla and all the lore.This movie was just ok, It wasn't as good as the previous movie or as good as Final Wars."
3,"Mediocre film of the current series, but still entertaining.","This film is more about Kiryu (aka MechaGodzilla) rather than G himself. Actually, G rarely does anything in this film. The first few minutes are very good, but later on, he just stands still during the battles!(?)! anyway, the storyline is typical. The gov't decided to build a robotic Godzilla, using the original '54 Godzilla bones, to defend Japan from Godzilla. The battle scenes are decent. Kiryu knows how to kick butt and obvisiously Godzilla just takes it without putting up too much of a fight. As for the dvd itself, the video quality is amazing and the audio features the original japanese language along with an english dub. Extras are of trailers for non-G related films--------For those that do not know, this is part 1 of a 2 film series. The sequel, ""Godzilla: TOKYO S.O.S."" is not currently available on DVD, but hopefully soon."
3,Gozilla vs. Megagodzilla,"The story line of the creation of Megagodzilla was interesting ,and the viewer is kept interested enough to want to see how the conflict ends. I very much liked the story of the little child and her dislike of the idea of destroying any form of life. She felt that she was sort of an outsider and bonded with the female officer on that basis. The hostility of the rest of the crew against the female officer was offensive to me. The attitude of the crew member who lost his brother while understandable for a time is irritating after it continues to dominate his view of the female officer. I did not enjoy this film as much as I enjoyed some of the older Godzilla movies. The younger officers shown in the film seem not to have respect for authority. It may be my age, but I prefer the films with more middle-aged characters and more serious consideration of issues."
4,this movie is greattttttt.,"after seeing this godzilla movie ,all i can say is that this movie is great. it is one of the best from toho . the movie is very fast paced, the special effects are fantastic , and the action never stops . i have one final word for godzilla fans everywhere {don't miss this movie }"
3,Great looking Godzilla.....,"Godzilla sure look cool and mean and the special effects are muchbetter than previous versions.I really wanted to enjoy this film, but the english dubbing is the worstive heard in all Godzilla movies that ive watched. It sure did not matchthe emotions from the screen..but we know that, but what takes the cake,it the little girl's voice seems to be from a adult imitating a littlegirl. The results are so unimpressive that i had to foward the movieto get past her. How can someone created such good movies and dont careabout the quality about the dubbing that can change the outlook of amovie. This has been going on for a long time.Too bad studios that release movies dont care about the dubbing oftheir treasures once they go international. If i made a movie, i wouldmake sure to oversee all dubbing applications and their results to makesure my film would retain quality in international markets...."
2,"Effects Getting Better, But Story Doesn't Deliver","This was better than Final Wars, so I'm giving it two and half stars, but still it didn't top G2K. I thought the premise of developing a mechanical/living hybrid from the sheletal and DNA remains of the Oxygenized Godzilla from the orginal film was great. I was expecting even more thrills and chills when for a moment after the current Godzilla roars, Mechagodzilla starts realizing what or who it is. This showed a lot of promise since a Japanese created machine potentially running amuck may have caused the Japanese to rely on Godzilla to save them from their own creation. Alas, this wasn't pursued and the film went down hill from there. Too bad."
2,A Step Back In The Godzilla Series,"After viewing GMK (Godzilla, Mothra, and King Ghidorah: All out Monsters Attack), I thought there was no where to go but up for the Godzilla series.....Boy was I wrong. Godzilla Against MechaGodzilla went right back to the same formula as other Godzilla movies....poor story, poor special effects, and overall uninteresting. It blows me away how a movie like GMK can do so many things never seen before in a Godzilla movie (like awesome special effects, unique camera shots, a unique story that really moved), and then this one to be such a disappointment....nothing I haven't seen before. This is the first in a trilogy featuring MechaGodzilla.....let's hope the next two are better.If you are a Godzilla fan, you must own it, but don't rush out to get it. If you're not a Godzilla fan....purchase GMK, in my opinion, the ultimate Godzilla movie."
1,Why the heck was this movie ever made????!!!!!,"Mechagodzilla is made from the first Godzilla`s bones-okay there`s already a problem. That problem is that Mechagodzilla is like 200 feet tall and the first Godzilla was only 150! Also this movie is BOORRINGG! Godzilla barely appears until the last 20 minutes!!! At least the good special effects (GMK`s were still a heck of alot better!) and the final battle are good, but that still doesn`t make up for the crappy rest of the movie!"
5,One of the best Gojira's ever,"This one is serious! It is not the old 'cheesy' animation, it is state of the art. It is serious and the fights are serious and believable rather than the others.The music is FANTASTIC! I bought the orignal Japanese version in Japan, but if the English version also contains the making of the music score and you are interested in music - watch it. It is really interesting how they produced the score in Moscow.Well, the movie itself, has IMO the best minatures ever and the most amazing CG animated fights I ever saw in a 'G' movie up to now.This DVD is a real 'YES I want it' from a 1963 'G' fan ever since. I can only recommend this movie to any serious 'G' fan and also action movie fan. It can't be compared with the predecessor - Godzilla 2000 - and the successor - Tokyo SOS. Both are far behind in quality, story continguancy and story itself.Highly recommended!"
3,"Fairly Disappointing, Yet a Must-Own","Short and sweet: I was a bit disappointed in the lack of action and the seemingly poor conversion to English language (I apologize for that comment if Toho actually made the film so unrecoverable). Kiryu (Mecha-G) is pretty cool looking, but I liked the 90's version more. Godzilla's appearance has regressed...I think the director was over-compensating for the lack of pupils in ""...All Out Monsters Attack"" (which is a MUCH better movie). What G needs is a battle against Gigan. Someone...please bring Gigan or Megalon back....pleassse. I really wish Godzilla had an answer to any of the Gamera-trilogy movies. Maybe ""Final Wars"" will be a step-up."
2,Disappointing,"After being very disappointed with ""GMK"", I was excited to hear that Godzilla X Mechagodzilla was supposed to be very different from GMK, much darker, and using the familiar Godzilla suit.I think I'm starting to understand that Japan loves bad CG. That's the only explanation I can think of. So many shots look like they were composited using Photoshop. The battles are boring. The acting is surprisingly the only thing worth talking about.The DVD has no Godzilla-related extras. Only trailers for other strange badly CG'd Japanese movies.Unless you like bad japanese-style CG, you should avoid this Godzilla title and stick with stuff from the 90's. Hopefully the new flick ""Final Wars"" won't look like crap."
4,Monster Against Machine!,"May 28th 2004 This would probably one of the BEST Godzilla movies I've seen! The story line is pretty cool,the special effects weren't perfect but awesome,Mecha Godzilla [a.k.a Kiyru] is my favorite character because the costume is pretty cool,and I was kind of disapointed at the ending but they've made a direct sequel called Godzilla x Mothra x Mecha Godzilla which there probably dubbing right now. I am sort of diapointed that Godzilla's atomic breath is blue.In order to save themselves the Japanese get the Godzilla skeleton from 1954 and put it to Mecha Godzilla [NOT a clone of Godzilla] and put a gun called Absolute Zero.It can destroy anything. Just as the Japanese are testing the shadow of Godzilla reappears and the battle begins!"
4,Wonderful and convincing account of a spiritual quest.,"A beautifully written and evocative book. Everything one could wish for in a spiritual quest. The Lighted Path is very akin to the equally spell-binding ""The Autobiography...."" by Richard G Patton. Both authors are able to touch the most sensitive pulse at our core and still manage to keep one foot in the world of spirit, while still moving about in the dense physical world. There should be more authors of this calibre working in the mass media, instead of the mindless pulp we are generally fed on TV. Highly recommended."
5,Indiana Jones meets the Celestine Prophecy!,"THE LIGHTED PATH reads like Indiana Jones meets the Celestine Prophecy with a little bit of Chicken Soup for the Soul! The book is the real-life account of how Risha Henrique's search for the meaning of today's spirituality turned into the adventure of a lifetime. Over a seven-year period, Risha was exposed to fire walks, sweat lodges, vision quests, the deep dream state, forgotten realms, and momentous prophecies. By sharing her adventure, she hopes to inspire others to step on to a ""lighted path""."
3,Bull Hunter,The story started slow and not too interesting but it got much better as the story developed. I ended enjoying the book.
3,Classic read,"This is a classic conservation read. However, I find it relatively plodding... I am not one for long and extended description of nature without a more important surrounding story. So just kind of boring. But still a classic read."
5,She loves them!,"Bought these for my wife for Mother's Day and she absolutely loves them. Cut, clarity and quality exceeded my expectations. I shopped the jewelry stores and these were a much better value than anything I could find there."
3,Two teenagers get a shocking introduction to old Rome,"Harry Turtledove is a master of alternative history and has many excellent novels to his credit.Using the alternative reality device rather than time travel, Turtledove gives us a glimpse of what might have been 20th century Europe had Rome never fallen. He doesn't give the Empire much of a chance of progressing very far beyond its state at its peak.Through the eyes of two teenagers, we experience the problems of sanitation, slavery and war. They are trapped in this world without their parents and must survive on their own. We see them deal with the contemporary problems of snobbery, sexism and bloated government bureaucracy.This book is simply written. Teens might enjoy it.This is definitely NOT Turtledove's best effort."
1,Not what I expected,"Being a big Turtledove fan I bought this book with great anticipation. Well I must not have researched this enough, it is a ""juvenile"" book. Might be OK in elementary school, or even junior high/middle school, but a long time has passed since I was part of that demographic segment. Shame on me, shame on you if you buy it expecting a regular Turtledove, may be OK for younger readers, but I couldn't finish it. I will doante it to my local library so maybe someone will be able to enjoy it?"
2,"Super Slow, ugh...","Well, had moderately high hopes for this, my first Turtledove book. Sadly, i will likely never read another.I'd really rate it 1.5001 stars, but i rounded up b/c i didn't hate it. It was a speck above that; i needed a distracting read so i picked it up and had nothing else to fill so gap, so i shouldered on.The science is all wrong; the plot is sickeningly predictable. The characters are insipid. Really, the only good thing is i successfully killed some time; otherwise, i would have given it half a star and never written this review.Rumor has it the author can do better, but i'm sure i'll never find out."
3,"Good YA SF, poor for adults.","As others have said, this really should be marketed as a Young Adult books. As a YA book it's a good introduction to Alternate History, and an enjoyable read. But if you put it next to the rest of his books and other Alternate History, there are two many holes for it to float on it's own.And as a aside, the most annoying thing to me was why in the world were they trading trinkets to the psuedo-romans in exchange for a few wagonloads of poor quality wheat when they could have just as easily grown millions of tons on it in robotic factory farms on one of the empty worlds that they used to get oil and minerals from?"
1,Isn't There a Zero Star Rating?,"If there were, I would certainly use it in this instance. Thankfully I didn't purchase this book but picked it up at the library, or I'd be angry rather than merely bemoaning the time I spent speed-reading this flat book. Turtledove used the Many Anvils of Fur Revulsion, Slave Hating, and Taste Judging to bludgeon any interest a reader may have had in the story. I kept checking the book jacket to see if I may have inadvertently missed a ""Young Adult"" icon. (There was none.) I, like another reviewer, simply didn't care whether Jeremy and Amanda made it out and back to their hometimeline or even if their parents were alive. I was half hoping the book would end with them stuck in the Roman Empire - would have served them right! Unsympathetic and arrogant characters, dumbed down language, religious moralizing I could certainly have done without. I will NOT be looking for the next book in the series."
3,Teen Angst in Rome,"Jeremy and Amanda Solter live and go to school in L.A., but they spend their summers working with their parents in an alternate timeline, one where the Roman Empire never fell. When a medical emergency calls their parents away, the teens are suddenly on their own. Then the transmissions from home stop and an invading army is at the city gates.Predictable plot aimed at teens, only interesting aspect is the look at how Romans lived day-to-day compared to modern society."
2,Working Too Hard,"Being a lover of H. Beam. Piper's Paratime Patrol-related books (especially Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen) I hoped for something similar from Turtledove. Alas, I found I just didn't care enough about the characters to look forward to reading what was coming up next in their story. Turtledove seems to try to make them interesting but there are plot eccentricities that jar. Why would anyone sell gaudy wrist-watches and Swiss Army knives in a Roman time line that also has developed a hyper-bureaucracy that keeps track of every little thing that stands out from the bland norm? Or take payment only in grain when buyers offer gold? Or ""go for a walk"" when there's a Lithuanian army coming to invest the town?Turtledove could stand a refresher re-reading Piper, or, for authors whose characters I care about: Connie Willis whose plague-year story ""Doomsday Book"" is searing and wonderful; and Lois Bujold whose Miles Vorkosigan stories are, well, great."
1,Disappointment to Say the Least,"I ordered this book because I am a big fan of Turtledove's alternate history books. The story description was enough to get me interested and the story concept seemed pretty good. I can't believe that it was written by Turtledove. There was never any suspense on where the story was going or where it would end up, the characters were a little superficial. Though the story is not similar, for some reason I was reminded of ""Farmer in the Sky"" by Heinlein which I read a long time ago. The story was simple and pretty boring. It seems like this was written to become a series, and I am not sure I will buy any more if this series continues."
4,Dayminder,"First time ordering from this company. I am very pleased with the product and the shipping time. Product received in great condition, on time and as described."
3,Functional,I love monthly planners. This is taller than I usually use. Could have more pages for contact info. Enough space to write several things per day. It is adequate.
3,Overpriced calendar,"This is simply a flimsy calendar with lines in the boxes. The paper is printer paper, the outside is the thickness of a shiny manila folder, and the whole thing is so thin-- 16 pages inside. I did misunderstand the description--I must have confused it with another daily and monthly planner I was looking at-- but still, I feel that this is extremely overpriced for how simple and thin it is."
1,Binding...what binding?,"The front cover was hole punched incorrectly. when I took the item out of the shipping box, the cover was already halfway off. The pages and back cover were appropriately attached, but the front cover was hanging on by four holes and was ready to fall of at any minute.Because I frequently order through Amazon, I didn't even have to return the item. I was able to keep it - not sure how to use it, but at least I didn't have to go through annoying returns process or hit up the post office this time of year.Very poor product but great Amazon experience."
1,Very disappointed in product,"I'll admit that I had pretty high expectations since this was, after all, Trumper's signature cologne. Boy was I in for a big let down. GFT cologne smells no differently than lemon scented LYSOL. I also asked another person's opinion and guess what she said? You guessed it ..Lysol. I can't tell you how disappointed I was. This cologne also comes with no shrink wrap or factory seal so it has an apprearance of being used. Thank goodness the vendor was honest and accepted my return. In the end, I was only out $5.00 for the shipping. Five bucks can buy a BIG bottle of Lysol!"
5,Wonderful Bride Companion Book,"This book is terrific! Charlotte did a great job writting it. Anyone that you know that is getting married, just engaged, or thinking about getting married, this is definitely the book for them.I got the book for my sister and 2 of my friends that are getting married and they think that it has been a big help to them in planning their weddings. It really helps to remind you to keep everything in perspective."
3,"Historically important content, difficult presentation","I do wish the publisher had provided a bit more information about this book in the description. I will keep my copy, and it is useful, and the cover image is bizarrely unconnected to the content. It's not clear to me why the scanning process introduces so much blur; was the original truly that bad? Because of the blur, many of the illustrations are close to useless.Like other public domain content books that have been reprinted, the content anticipates that the reader has a pretty good understanding of the field. A similar book written today would explain a great deal more.Rug Weaving for Everyone is currently selling for about $30. Buy Collingwood first, and then let RWFW round out your collection.You might want to note that my fellow reviewer apparently thinks every weaving book ever produced is a five-star. I envy his/her library. My own weaving library has some duds that don't warrant five-star reviews."
2,Wouldn't buy again,This repeater kept dropping from the network. I was using it in a businesses application and finally just removed it b/c it was more of a hassle than a help to have to keep re-setting my equipment. Think twice before using it. I recommend Apple express instead
4,nice diary - little bit to expensive,"the diary is good quality, but a little bit to expensive, you can get diarys with better design for 7 dollars on amazon in other countries."
2,meh,"this was to replace my trusty old manual Nikon. after messing with the automatic features, which were cumbersome and confusing, I put this one in the closet and bought a new Kodak digital instead."
1,N60 lacks features,"I was disappointed with the N60. It is a very basic entry-level camera that lacks a lot of features that can be found in Canon's and Minolta's entry level cameras. Trust me, the Canon Rebel 2000 and Minolta XTsi are a better bargain."
2,"Well, hmm...","I went to my local camera store and rented one of these. I must say, the pictures were of a so-so quality, but other than that, this camera really sucks. The auto features are rather lacking in quality, but then again, I really dislike using auto, so it may just be me. Then, I compared the general feel of it to my old Ricoh KR-5, and this camera feels, well, junky. It is overly heavy, and not because of sturdy construction. Canon, Minolta and Ricoh are constructed sturdily, not this one. This has what I would describe as a flimsy feel, and when used in manual mode, well, the camera does not feel up to par when compared to every other brand, model, and make out there."
5,NIKON N60 SLR CAMERA,"I JUST LOVE MY NEW NIKON N60 SLR CAMERA. WHILE IT IS NOT HEAVY IT IS CERTAINLY STURDY AND WELL BUILT, AND FEELS LIKE A CAMERA SHOULD. I TRIED THE CANON REBEL 2000 KIT FIRST. IT WAS JUST A FEW DOLLARS LESS THAN THE NIKON. IT WAS VERY POORLY MADE, AND THE QUALITY OF THE NIKON PICTURES ARE SO SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN THE CANNON. THIS IS THE CAMERA FOR THE TRUE AMATEUR AND I THINK YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! I ALSO SCOPED OUT THE NEW MINOLTA SLR AND AFTER A VERBAL BRIEFING BY THE SALES PERSON AND TAKING IT OUTSIDE FOR A TRIAL, I KNEW THAT WOULD NEVER BE FOR ME."
4,Good translation,This translation is very similar to the penguin classics one in choice of words. Some of the translation choices seemed to be more accurate in creating a complete overall picture than did other translations.
3,More about sex than love,This classic piece is about the base attractions of mankind. It was obviously written in a time when such discussion blurred the lines between morality and reality. A very interesting look into mankind at that point in history and human society development.
1,NEVER RECEIVED THE BOOK!!,I paid for the book and never received it--nor have I ever received any explanation why the book is missing. This is unacceptable. I am going to request a refund. Please avoid using this owner.
1,Historical interest,"Readers should note the 1972 publication date and be aware that this item is primarily of historical interest for students of changing concepts of mental illness. The book is not a useful contribution to modern studies of pervasive developmental disorders, as it was written before genetic factors were strongly suspected and before early detection of autism was considered possible. It should be noted that the Tinbergens, in their later volume on this subject, acknowledged that the ethological approach to treatment of autism was quite speculative."
4,"A wonderful, accessable read!","This book is very enjoyable read. It is not purely science, and certainly not purely about the limpit. A fine combination of one man's philosophy about life, and how he feels we should fit into the natural world, that also teaches you about the natural history of (mostly) cephalopods. A pleasant departure for the scientist, and an enlightening introduction to marine biology for the layman."
3,Musically excellent but video misses,"Smoking hot Gwen Stefani leads this band which focused on fairly mainstream pop/rock. Included here are a dozen or so well known songs, pretty much played like they sound on the radio. Don't get me wrong, the band is very good but don't stretch out much here. I've always liked their sound and what's not to like about Stefani. She's beautiful, provocative and sexy without being surly and skanky. Nice combination. The concert unfortunately is poorly filmed. It is a 4:3 cut (for TV I assume) and the director/editor can't focus on any one shot more than about 3 seconds. Still, while the music was overplayed and sounds a bit dated now, the performances are strong and exactly what the audience wanted. The DTS 5.1 sound is exemplary as well."
3,Gwen Stefani & No Doubt in concert,"There's NO DOUBT (sic) that this is an accomplished band and if you like a performancer with a raw edge, punk attitude & gratuitous swearing this concert is for you. On the other hand, if what you love about In Doubt is primarily their catchy tunes, you're better off listening to their audio CDs."
3,Not what I was expecting,"I was expecting a whole lot more from this DVD. It would seem ND have deliberately changed their playing style on this tour to be a little more ""reggae"" or ""rock steadyish."" The best performances in my opinion are the Rock Steady songs, while the rest seem just a little more mellowed out than I'm used to. For anyone who's seen ""Live in the Tragic Kingdom,"" I think you'll know what I'm saying. Infact, even when I saw them on the Rock Steady tour they were way more up beat than on here.Never the less, the special features are great!! Tony's Pirate thing is probably the best part, and anything Tom says is just cool!! And there's even an ""Easter Egg"" revealing footage of the band hanging out and recording in Jamaica!!! Hearing Gwen say ""that's amazing"" about the glow fly thing just cracks me up!!So yeah guys, it's not too bad but if you're a hardcore fan try getting Boom Box if you haven't already just for the Tragic Kingdom DVD, which is just a way funner show!!"
4,i liked this dvd a lot,"Well, I've been hearing No Doubt on the radio and stuff for years and just recently got their CD with the singles throughout their career. I liked it so much I decided to get this DVD. I've seen them on TV for award shows and things and I knew Gwen was an amazing performer. She jumps around and the whole ""Just A Girl"" thing with ""What you looking at?"" and Gwen doing push-ups is great. This was a good concert with good sound quality. I love the music and they are a very entertaining band to watch. They move around a lot and wear cool outfits. There's 4 bonus songs on here with other special features too. There's an interview with the band and other features that just show footage of the members doing stuff. Lik Adrian golfing and drumming and playing with his kid or Tony talking about opening a pirate shop or Gwen as a Pussycat doll."
3,too jumpy indeed,"I really like NoDoubt, however, I can not give this DVD 5 stars because they way it is edited it really makes your head hurt, as another reviewer mentioned (I really agree with you!!!). I do not understand why they have to present a concert in such a manner, no way we can really watch the performers when the editing makes the cameras jump from one performer to the other. I really wish that they would stop this MTV-style editing. Let us watch a performance, please!!!!! With that out, the music is good, it is nice to see and hear them live. Good concert from a good group."
5,Energetic Concert DVD,"The DVD is really good. Most of her songs sound better performed live than the studio versions, so that makes this DVD a must for anyone who likes their songs. The sound and picture quality of the DVD is great, and the concert itself is packed with good songs from their past and present. Songs like Magics in the Makeup and Running and jus amazing when she sings it live like the DVD. Only thing I didn't like about it is sometimes the camera jumps alot from band member to and member."
3,"Good show, good music, bad words for little ears.","This is a great band with great music. I saw them open for U2 in 2001 just as the Rock Steady CD was hitting stores. This video has a much more polished show and the sound is great (of course they were the opening act when I saw them, so they were limit then). The video has a great selection of songs and a few older tunes in the bonus clips. The one thing that struck me as a disappointment was Gwen's excessive use of the ""F word."" I'm not generally offended by curse words, but she used so often, it took away from the impact of the word and became almost annoying. It took away from my enjoyment of the video. Again the video is good and worth watching (but not with children with sensitive ears)."
3,Average,"Overall, its pretty average. Gwen should be a solo artist and compete with Britney, Madonna, Hilary, Shakira, Christina & Kylie. The video collection is much better."
5,Best live band of our time,"No Doubt is, by far, the best live band of the past decade. Their energy is absolutely infectious and who doesn't love Gwen Stefani? No Doubt was the first concert I ever attended in 2000, and if you haven't seen them live, I suggest doing so. They are amazing."
3,Okay,"It is okay.Part of it stays in tune, part of it doesn't. Maybe ours is defective, but it is really annoying to have to keep fixing it."
4,The most well-thought-out language dictionary,"I've a love for words - exotic words, obsolete words, obscure words, etymology, the study of languages. So I've got a cache of language dictionaries in my library. But this one is the star of them all. The makers of Langenscheidt's Japanese-English pocket dictionary actually thought out words with multiple uses and definitions in English. Say for example, you look up the word ""stormy"" -- the Japanese words for ""stormy"" as in weather condition and ""stormy"" as in relationship are given. Many other definitions in this dictionary follow that example. I've never seen this in any other brand of language dictionary. Rest assured, I'm sticking with Langenscheidt from now on."
4,Complex but Competent,"Sounds great, works great. It's taken me about a week to get comfortable with all the controls and the remote, but I'm now able to use the system to do whatever I want in terms of recording and playback. Would ultimately have liked a second set of speaker jacks, but nothing is perfect. Throw away those cassettes! MiniDisc is definitely the future of recordable, portable audio."
3,Works... Mostly,"This card works, it's just been a little finicky - I don't know if it's Windows acting up or if it's the drivers for the card, impossible to say. The system which it's installed on tends to lose connectivity after a couple of hours - can be a real pain if you download large files. It works though! Any casual user won't complain too much, a system restart will fix the connection if it's down and the card tends to stay online during normal usage. Good price."
5,Everything I looked for,Nice all parts are included as stated. Got both of my keyboards and I also received the DVD that thought me how to use the calculator.
5,Great for high school,"I just got this for my algebra 2 class and it works wonders in there. Problems become easier and more understandable, and if i need help from my teacher I can switch the keyboards and not have to worry about them not knowing how to work the calculator."
1,broke within a year,I bought this for my son and it just stopped working about 12 1/2 weeks after purchase. Now he needs a new one for AP CALC. iT IS NO LONGER COVERED UNDER WARRANTY
5,Excellent,"My son really likes this calculator. It is very easy to use, he didn't even read the manual that much!Pretty expensive though. I bought TI-83 Plus Silver Edition for my older son for $90. Now that model is obsolete, I expected TI - Nspire to be a similar price, since it is the new TI - 83 Plus Silver they claim!"
5,A Life Saver,This calculator is the best tool for pre calc and Calc. IT has a lot of features and may become complicated at times but it does get the job done. The new UI is so easy to follow but the keypad will get frustrating because the letter keys get in your way. TI did fix this problem by making a new version of this calculator and a new keyboard they have separated the keys and numbers to make your life easier. So i would suggest that keypad. All in all this calculator is amazing i still have not explored all its features but i soon will once I take Calculus.
4,The idea is good... but,"The idea is good. Being able to switch between TI calculators for less $$$ is great. There are a few problems though:1. Takes forever to load (sure only the first time you use a certain calculator... but it is still annoying if you pop a new one in and want to use it instantly.2. The button layout of the one with green buttons all over it.Even TI Knows the button layout is horrible. About a year ago, TI got teens to test out the TI-nspire and several new key layouts for the one with green buttons everywhere. The new ones were 100x better. It would almost anger me if they completely ignore the results (perhaps one of twenty liked the current because they didn't understand the new ones).Hopefully they change the key layout because one of them was amazing (not saying anything though). =)."
1,Terrible non-intuitive,"The TI calculators and in particular the NSPIRE are terrible. The NSPIRE has a supposedly advanced interface but it is clumsy, cumbersome, non-intuitive. I find my self reaching for a reference manual on every effort with this. Furthermore there are NO useful manuals or texts for actually using this calculator for actual work rather than as an educational tool of some sort. I have doubts as to it's utility for that considering how arcane the GUI is. Common functions like delete a tab window is buried way down under tools, I constantly forget how to close out unneeded windows."
5,TI -NSpire,My son's school uses the TI-84 but the NSpire is well worth the difference in price because it comes with the TI-84 system as a removable module. It is like having two graphing calculators.NOTE: Because the modules are self-contained you can NOT transfer data between the TI-84 module and the TI-NSpire module.
2,Good intentions...not so great implementation,"This calculator...wait, we can't call it that...its now a handheld (whatever), is a good idea but makes no sense. If you have a cell phone you know what hand held technology can do and this expensive device does very little. Its not in color, the batteries last maybe a day, and the key pad is awkward at best. You would be better off buying an iphone and using it to connect to websites that do pretty much the same things that this device does. The ideas are great and the interactivity is really nice but for the price you should get a lot more these days and TI doesn't really seem interested in supporting its devices and only wants your money."
2,Buyer Beware,"I guess I was hoping for a bunch of early TV appearances and/or film inserts of the Kinks. Unfortunately, Kinks EP only contains 4 songs: Waterloo Sunset, Mr. Pleasant, Plastic Man, and Muswell Hillbilly, all apparently taped for the Beat Club TV show. At least Muswell Hillbilly has an actual live performance rather than featuring the band lipsynching, rather haphazardly, to the original recordings. Worse still, the sound quality is terrible. Why couldn't they at least overlay a remastered version of the original songs over the first three performances? None of the info provided in the 'pop-up' section was a revelation, and a majority of the DVD was used for advertisements for other collections."
3,"Half must-see, half boredom","The videos are enjoyable, especially the video, ""Muswell Hillbilly."" So are the pop-ups and product previews. I was not too interested in the jukebox of live performances. Buy it if you like live performances, B & W videos, etc. Live performances bore me!!!"
4,Very inspiring,"I'm not 100% convinced of his theological principle: 'today's life being directly equal to our eternal life in heaven', BUT it's very encouraging, has a wonderful message and offers great hope to those who are presently discouraged or unsure of why we're here on earth, and why it's so painful at times."
1,"Worked great, until it died.","I was very happy with the quality of sound from this sub-woofer. However, recently it stopped working and only emits a high-pitched buzz, with or without input. Online investigation reveals that lots of people find this speaker self-destructs after three years. I live in an apartment building so I definitely did not stress it at all. Certainly won't buy this make next time. Very disappointing."
4,Mirage OMNI S8,"I own Mirage products prior to purchasing the OMNI S8 so I knew the quality of the product already. When I found this deal, I couldn't pass it up. It arrive on time and in a well protected box. I was very concerned in its condition when delivered, and was glad to find the product in perfect working condition."
5,Great compact sub.,"This is a great deal for $140.00 bucks and probably is the best powered sub for the money. It's great for small/medium rooms. Don't let the 8'' size fool you. The bass is really clean and detailed. The little beast is powerful enough to make my floor shake. I always hated massive and ugly looking sub woofers. The build quality of this is superb and the size is attractive. Once it breaks in, it will sound like heaven."
1,Hits like a six year old.,"Tried this out on multiple receivers, as well as using multiple inputs: RCA, Optical (CD, Phono, Computer).Sub gets marks for being great filler, but if you are looking for any type of bass hit this will leaving you wanting three, maybe four more of these subs.Will be returning sadly."
1,Meg Chin Lee where are you?,"Discovery Meg Chin Lee was on this album, I bought it. But I listened once and threw the CD to the recycle. What the concraptics was that? If you like techno trance that uses the same bneat through out the entuire album to make it sound like on continous head bobbing album, it almost succeded. I found no head bobbing. I highly recomend Meg Chin Lee, but not on this album. Was she even on there?"
2,You can play this until you get frustrated...,"I loved the Die Hard movies so I bought this one. I have constant problems with the game on Windows XP, can't save a game, so I have to start over whenever I get killed, the sound is all screwed up and although I enjoyed the game in spots, I angrily quit several times because of the NO SAVE problem. I had the same problem with Windows 98 SE so I don't know if its the game or the computer. It'll be nice when they work out the kinks and finally make a game with good controls and ""Save""... I still play it once in awhile because it has it's good side - so long as you don't get killed..."
5,Good,I love these socks i only wear them a majority of the time they are comfortable and they were delivered on time.i would recommend these to others.
5,Perfect,"So I get to California for a two-week visit and I unpack, and I remembered the cream I put on my feet at night, and I forgot the white socks I sleep in... No problem! Amazon and Hanes saved the day!I have Amazon Prime, so the socks arrived within 2 days, and they are super!"
3,Good for the price,"Good quality socks for the price, however, they do show when wearing sneakers and capris. I would purchase again if I needed regular socks instead of no show."
5,"Fast, and in excellent condition...","Fast, and in excellent condition... I received just what I ordered. No delays, no hassle."
4,Fit great; not enough cushion,"Fit and price are great for these socks, but they are no more cushioned than regular Hanes socks, or imperceptibly more. Caveat emptor."
5,Raw Footage,"This documentary gives you true footage on life, culture and history of new orleans. many rap artist appear in the film. Soulja Slim (r.i.p) b.gizzle, squad up, juvie, and ect. This gives you a shocking reality on new orleans besides the french quarters. And that the infamous housing projects and wards of new orleans which are ridden with crime and social issues that show the grimy reality of the streets."
3,Good but not updated version,"I used the guide for my travel to the south of Poland, and though it was useful in some extent, it was so out of date that some tips that could be useful in 2000, guide you mistakenly now"
1,very disappointed,"I bought the dvd player to use on a long plane trip.I was inflight when I used the dvd player. I was very disappointed to find that the dvd did not load correctly. I got sound but no picture. I thought it was something that I was doing wrong. I attempted to access the dvd again when I arrived at my hotel room- to no avail. When I returned home, my husband was able to get it to work for awhile then he too was unable to get a picture. I returned it to the store within 30 days. Now I'm trying to find a light weight dvd player with at least a 10 inch screen and a decent battery- Wish me luck"
1,It's a lemon,"I bought one in July. Less than two weeks later, it died. Amazon replaced it. The new one has worked (with the exception of periodically not wanting to read DVDs) until today, when it died as well. The unit is fully charged, I've replaced the battery, checked all of the connections...and I still get a ""no signal"" message. It's a dud. Don't waste your money."
3,Great picture; poor sound,"I have had this for over a year now. I haven't used the battery, and I don't ""travel"" with it. I use it in the house & for the backyard. The picture is great. There are times the lid does not catch properly. The biggest problem is the volume does not go high enough. Often I read the subtitles since I cannot get the volume any higher. I use it almost every day and it is pretty reliable. I have been pleased with the product except for the sound."
3,"Good picture, weak speakers","The picture quality is pretty good. The problems I've had with it is that when you first put a DVD in, it can take it several minutes before it can read the disk. Sometimes, I have to turn it off and turn it on again just to make it work. The built in speakers are OK for a really really quiet environment. The remote is cool though."
3,One good One has issues,I bought two of these. Both have worked good until about 2 weeks ago. I had one player that sometimes has trouble reading the disk.
4,Awsome,"I loved this portable dvd player, I guess someone else did too! The swivel screen is a very nice feature. It makes it small and compact. I guess that is what made it so easy to steal."
4,"Big screen in this portable category, but...","it lacks a TV receiver. It is boring to watch kids DVD movies all the time with the kids. Sometimes, when I wish that I could watch TV with this Polaroid, yet it does not have that feature.It is not versatile enough for me. Maybe for the kids, it is okay. That's why I deducted one star from its score.Someone suggests that I should consider the Axion AXN-7080 DVD+TV portable unit with same LCD screen and thin design. Too bad that I think I have spend too much on just this DVD only player, otherwise I don't have to wait to buy the Axion one, which I think should be more versatile for about the same or even cheaper price."
5,Fabulous,"This pair of princess cut diamond studs is the 3rd pair of diamonds studs I have bought through Amazon. The quality is much better than anything I have seen in any store! The pair I received is actually of better quality than advertized here, as well as the other 2 pairs I have bought. They are rated of ""F"" color (superburb and rare find in a stud earring) and VVS2/VS1 clarity. Retail value was rated to be worth $925.00. They are a great size.I am totally pleased with my purchase."
1,False Advertising,This game would not run on windows XP. Its not advertised for windows Vista so I hope if you plan to buy this your still running windows 95 or 3.something.
4,Fun and Educational,I have a pre-teen girl and both of us have enjoyed this game so much that we now are giving it as birthday presents to her girlfriends.
3,7 WONDERS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD,"WHY IS THERE A GAME LIKE THIS THAT YOU PAY FOR AND IT WILL NOT LET YOU WIN. IT IS AN EXCELLENT GAME, BUT YOU CANNOT GET AHEAD TO THE END TO WIN. IF SOMEONE DID, GIVE ME A SHOUT OUT."
2,7 Wonders,"Not much to this game. Either I didn't get it, or it is just a boring game. Oh well, there are better ones out there!"
5,Harrowing narrative,"Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. If you believe that (and this reviewer does, in most instances), you will make it through this harrowing exploration of the arrogance of Joseph P. Kennedy, which he later had to pay for when his body was locked in paralysis and old age. This reviewer wishes we could know what went on in this pitiful man's mind in his final years. Garry Wills is one of the few writers in America who could have crafted this examination with such truth."
3,just okay,had some interesting theories but was author was touted as being one of the best sources on Kennedy (by Vanity Fair). I found it to be very gossipy.
1,Further picking at the dry bones of our great and fallen heroes,"will the industry profitting from our past possibilities, our possibility for glory as a nation, never end?Leave our dead to rest and honor our dead.DO not pick each marrow dust from within their great bones.HOnor our dead and arise to be who we once were to be.Not what we have now so disgracefully become.TO rationalize their sacrifice through books such as these we dishonor our dead and accomplice their assassinations. We do not share in their intelligent heroism and march on but cowardly stick another blade into their mighty bones. Et tu, Wills?"
2,Done by a decorator.,"Photos of over decorated sterile rooms. Source list is only decorators. Not helpful to the average person who does his/her own designing. Much better books available with the ""real secrets""."
4,For Greek Revival Geeks,"Detailed review of Greek Revival architecture in the first half of the 19th century including origins and a survey of significant buildings in this style. Thorough and professional, this reference is itself now a historical view of the thinking, circa 1944, a century after construction of the buildings included in this book. Many drawings and photos, though in black and white, serve to illustrate the text."
5,Yes!!!,"This is the best FLA release since... Millenium! It is a combination of that disc and their last one, Flavor of the Weak. The ""electronica"" feel combined with melodies and choruses that made Millenium so good. The song ""Unknown Dreams"" may be their most accessible song to date. I wonder if they played this on the radio, if it would be a hit? It's pretty good. The song ""Prophecy"" is also superb, almost like a computerized ""Convulsion"" off of Too Dark Park. My biggest complaint with FLA is they try to be too cool and end up sounding cheesy. This album keeps that to a minimum. Industrial fans must get it!"
4,IMPLODE YOURSELF ! ! !,"""Implode"" may sound different but it still maintains the same harsh electronic vibe of ""[FLA]vour of the weak"" and ""Re-Wind"". It is quite good. I hope a remix/follow-up comes along. FLA forever !!!"
5,You can't go wrong with too many synths!,"This was the first FLA album I ever bought. Track 3 was definitely enough to give the cd 5 stars, but 1,2,7,and 8 all shine in my book. And speaking of the book, the cover art is sweet as hell. buy this album. i command you."
5,WOW!,I have never seen such great man/beetle loving in my life! I give this cd 5 stars just because of the great cover of the album! MAN DAT BEAST BE KICKIN' IT! Uhhh...the music is good too I guess
2,Like a movie with missing scenes...,"I understand that this is a fast, difficult game at times and that is why, when you actually break down and buy a strategy guide (which I'm loathe to do in the first place) you expect it to be really right on. I encountered three places in the game (incidently, more than half of the times I looked something up in the guide) where I was baffled even with the guide. It either gave no detail or skipped over the problem entirely. For all I know, this was intentional but when you shell out the duccats for a guide, you expect some degree of competancy from the people writing it."
5,brilliant book with dreamy quality,ever wonder how bosphorus would like when it dries up?or wonder about the story of palace dwarves in ottoman times?famous gangsters? mirrors reflecting mirrors reflecting mirrors ad nauseam? why orhan pamuk's daughter is named rüya(dream)?-a fact actually-how to be a unique person?where alaaddin's store is?-it still is in nisantas and i can describe the way to it if you are interested-the fascinating story of mannequins peopling the tunnels under pera? well then if you do you should read this book.definitely recommended.
2,I didn't get it,"What can I say? I hate to swim upstream against all the readers who loved the book, but what the heck, I didn't. I've gone back and reread the reviews, trying to determine if it was me, or if the emperor isn't wearing clothes. I still haven't made the determination, but will take the blame, chalking it up to a mismatch of expections.I'm traveling to Turkey and wanted a novel to acquaint me with its people and culture. The story line, the mystery of a missing wife and columnist in Istanbul, seemed like an interesting vehicle. The story line though, is way, way down the list on the author's agenda, an agenda that seems to be headed with baring his (and presumably the Turkish) soul. Its a surealistic therapy session of stories within stories - dense, dark, complex, repetitious, and for me, a tedious exercise.The novel was simply too much work for minimal reward."
4,dense and revealing,"This is the second Orhan Pamuk book that I have read, SNOW being the first. As with SNOW, BLACK puts the reader through dense and often obscure background of the characters while getting to the point of the plot. Given the turkish government attempts to repress this author, I feel like I am getting a window into the country and the character of the citizens. It is fiction that carries the weight of a dire social and cultural reality. This is not a book for the featherweight reader."
4,A puzzling English translation.,"I suspect a far richer story awaits the fortunate reader of Turkish. I was knocked sideways by the ""Douglas Fairbanks"" reference and never felt I could trust the translator again. I am curious to know if others, able to read both the original and English versions might offer me additional insights? The story is interesting, some of the musings are exquisite and the rambling around Istanbul at all hours is delicious. That being said, is she [Guneli Gun] putting her own words [or lack thereof] into this author's writing? Her repetition of odd words, such as ""geezer"" led me to believe her English vocabulary is archaic. In an attempt to solve this additional mystery of The Black Book, I will read her own published work, trying to assume her writing style!"
2,zzzz......,"Unless you have particular interest in Istanbul or modern philosphy this book is a waste of your time. Or maybe there's something particularly beautiful about the writing that is lost in translation? I just didn't get it.My Name is Red, another of Pamuk's books is wonderful. I kept reading this one expecting the same magic but was left disappointed."
4,Orientalist!##!*!.... but a milestone for Turkish literature,"In my opinion, 'The Black Book' is a post-modernist challenge... The (Black) book is like a labrynth and the reader feels her or himself a kind of intellectual dedective. 'Cause It refers to so many books.Post-Criticum: Most beatiful epigraphs..."
5,"Absolutely Dazzling, Lively, Smart!!!!","This is one of the best books I have ever read. This book does not only talk about the modern Turkish life in Istanbul, but moreover, the human psychology and the human mind. I have been so much effected by this book that it kept coming back to me until I analyzed my life through Pamuk's eyes. Everyone must read this book!!!! Absolutely great. Pamuk's genius can be read between the lines. He is a young Turkish talent that we should all pay attention to."
4,Mysterious and amazing,This is very stunning and vivid book to read.Most of the time readers find themselves to solve a puzzle.Every piece of the puzzle is well organized and forces the readers to pay attention every pages to fully comprehend the events.I strongly recommend everybody who likes to think while reading.
5,Journey of Fantasy,"I`m reading the Black Book nowadays and I simply enjoy it. Mysterious, enjoying and gives full taste of reading. You travel in Istanbul at some parts or travel in time at the others. Ideas fly around and I re-read some sentences to admire again how beautifully verbalized those ideas. Surprising and shocking events and findings follow each other. I am getting closer to the end. Will he find Ruya and Jelal? I wish it takes little more time (or fun) to find them."
4,Don't read this book - unless ...,"... you like books that are dense, dark, confusing, modernist (post or otherwise), deep, ... you get the picture.The entire book, though wrapped around a very thinly set up mystery, is about the philosophical conundrum of how can people be just themselves. Is it possible? Is it desirable? What would such a life be like?This is not for light reading; and it's not a page turner. One of Pamuk's early works, it has moments of amazingly good writing - followed by moments of boring, inessential details. Overall, the former outweighed the latter making for an interesting if not too entertaining a read."
3,"It's well-built,but not as easy to operate as Canon Eos Elan","I both own Nikon N70 and Canon EOS Elan. I used EOS Elan for several years , but N70 is new to me. N70 has a strong body,well-built than any other non-pros cameras(including Eos Elan) , but too many buttons . It's not easy to be familiar with it rather than EOS Elan. And the focus speed , it should be better."
3,purple haze,"I bought this camera (used) for only $15 shipped. (It's a F70)So I'm not complaining. (well, a little bit)It's a fine functioning product and a Nikon.One gripe though...after developing all my shots have a purple colored cast to them. Regardless of the lens, it's 'purple' dirt, purple giraffe, just plain purple. My Nikon N2020 & N8008 have no such problem using the exact same lenses.Needless to say, even though I like the way the F70 functions I'm back to using the other two older cameras.Maybe the digital cameras now have a good enough anti-shake (not blurry) that I should be looking into an upgrade. Problem is Nikon digital anti-shake mechanisms are inside the lenses so while my older film camera lenses can be used, I'm back to square one on digital shake.My Minolta lenses have no such problem with the Sony Alpha's. Their anti-shake is inside the camera so all old lenses get the benefit.Anyway, N70 or F70 it's 'Whoopee'...the color purple."
4,The movie IS actually better.,"I saw a filmed version of this novel at the Montreal Film Festival. Breathtaking does not aptly describe this film. I loved it so much, I wanted to read the book.While the book is enjoyable, deep (pardon the pun), and leaves the reader with a lot of thinking to do, the film captures all those abstract and intangbile emotions the book cannot aptly convey.At the premiere, the director spoke and said his movie would not have been possible without the book. He felt incredibly indebted to the author.I haven't seen or heard anything about the movie since my time in Montreal (that must have been in 1994), but, if at all possible, please see the film!"
5,Five good books for a very good price,"I think this set is a great deal since all of these books are great and have a very decent price (at the time bought). I also like the fact that these books retain the previous covers since I personally like them better than the new ones that have been issued lately, apparently by Disney (The previous covers were made by miramax books and DBG). Covers aside, the books are very good and I would recommend to try them to anyone."
3,Oh my God! This is a rough one.,"This anime is very rough and gritty. Definitely not for the faint of heart. It's full of violence and perversion. The story is also very dark as well. The plot, however, is well written. It has a very carefully crafted story, and interesting characters. The violence is way extreme, but realistic. As far as quality goes it's great. I'm just not that fond of stories that are as dark a this one. It can put you in a dark frame of mind. If that doesn't bother you, then you'll probably get a lot of satisfaction out of Shigurui. The animation quality and voice acting are very well done. It's a gamble I think, but some gambles pay off."
2,Could have been good,"The anime is Ok, not much more. The real problem is it succeed to make you interrested enough to want to see how it would end but the anime does not end. So you are left with an unsatisfaying end that make you feel like it did'nt worth your time. With a real conclusion, it could have been a 3 star anime but without it, I can't give more than 2. Substract 1 star if you dont like violence enough :)"
1,terrible,"Definitely not for mainstream. It was hard to follow, and even after reading explanations online, I'm still not sure what the point of this series was."
1,Great Animation but the story has lots of holes.,"Shiguri had some of the best animation from MADhouse, but the story is all over the place. The beginning of the series shows a dual that never happens never explains how the main character loses one of his arms. I had high hopes for this but was let down in the end. I can only recommend this for the awesome animation but the story has mad holes."
5,Excellent,"I had visited the Emilia Romagno in Italy. The food in that region, around Bologna, is noted as the best in the country and the world. I bought some cook books while in Italy but wanted a few more. This book is excellent. The Bolognese sauce used for Lasagna has become a favorite, as has the vanilla gelato recipe. A number of other recipes in the book are delicious as well. I have yet to try anything I did not like. And, based on having been there, the recipes are very authentic and recreate the taste and feel of the Emilia Romagno."
3,No more fairy tales!,"I was disappointed when I learned E. Lynn Harris would be continuing with the Basil/Yancey storyline in his latest book. As with all his other books, I couldn't put it down. When I got to the end, I found it to be somewhat unrealistic and fairy tale-ish. The idea of Rosa keeping a pregnancy from Basil because she thought he'd want to get married was totally unrealistic!! What woman in their right mind would expect a major player like that to want to settle down?? And he seems like Basil and Yancey are trying to be good people now....what's up with that?? Overall, the book was good, but don't put too much stock in the ending!"
4,WE FALL DOWN,"we fall down should have been the title of this book...just like the song, the characters fall only to get back up again. Yancy, Basil and the newcomer Bart rise above their mistakes and try to undo their wrongs (only if we could get Ava to fill the same way,lol). this book was a true page turner with a lot of twist, turns and dips. im glad that things are ok with Basil and Yancy (it takes a strong person to forgive) and that they both find what they are lookin for. but what about Ava? what about Basil and Raymond? E.Lynn always leaves the fans wanting more......"
3,Goood but..............,"I love E.Lynn Harris not just his writing but his personality. I have never seen an author so appreciative of his audience. He is so kind at his book signings and very personable. But his last two books have not been very good. The only thing that keeps me coming back to read his books is that he had made his audience curious about Basil. His story lines are weak and very predictable. I wish he would find the hunger that he one on his first two books, Invisible Life and Just as I am. I suggest that people buy the book but don't expect a masterpiece."
4,Not Mr. Harris's best work,"I love the depth of E.Lynn Harris's books, however I did not find it in this book. Any Way The Wind Blows was in my opinion a weak novel. It does not show Mr. Harris's true abilities. His main character Basil seem to lose his lovable characteristics as the book went alone and Yancey was so superficial you wanted to laugh. Ava was indeed annoying and unbelievable. Bart on the other had should have been excluded from the whole book entirely. If you read his novel before this one ""Not A Day Goes By,"" you will enjoy the updates on Basil and Yancey and that will make this book enjoyable and entertaining. Since I do love E.Lynn Harris I will look forward for his next published novel."
3,GOOD BUT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER!,"BEING AN AVID READER OF MR. HARRIS' NOVELS, I MUST SAY THAT THIS WAS SOMEWHAT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT. THE BOOK HAS A GOOD STORYLINE BUT THE CHARACTERS COULD HAVE BEEN MORE DEVELOPED. I ALSO THINK THAT MR. HARRIS SHOULD PUT BASIL HENDERSON TO REST. I MEAN REALLY, IT IS TIME. I FEEL THAT HE SHOULD MOVE ON AND CREATE NEW CHARACTERS. IT WOULD REALLY HELP FUTURE BOOKS, AND HOPEFULLY STOP THE PREDICTABLE ENDINGS WE HAVE FOUND IN THE LAST TWO BOOKS."
5,I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED,"E. Lynn Harris is worth his weight in gold. Any Way the Wind Blows is very entertaining and a page-turner. The reader will definitely want to know what happens next. I read this book in one sitting and didn't regret staying up to do it.I should not have been surprised at his ability to weave an even better tale than Not a Day Goes By--but he did.Hats off, Mr. Lynn and congratulations once again."
3,"Not the best, not the worst","I think fans of E. Lynn Harris will come away from reading this book with mixed emotions. Initially, catching up with Yancey and Basil is like getting the 411 on former classmates or kids who grew up down the block from you - like 'em or not, you want to know what's going on in their lives. However, soon some of the plot contrivances and goings-on begin to feel like daytime soap retreads. Yancey and Basil, two characters who were formerly evil and underhanded, separately take turns toward softer, gentler personalities, just in time to make room to for new baddie Bart and the returning diva of evil, Ava.I did find myself turning pages quickly, hoping for Ava's comeuppance and wondering if Basil's secret would be revealed, but ultimately this tale was anti-climactic. As always, E. Lynn moves the story briskly with his snappy dialogue (especially between the ""kids""), but ""Any Way..."" is kind of like fat-free ice cream: somewhat of a treat, but definitely not the real thing."
5,Never Boring!!!!!!!,"Just like everybody else I couldn't wait to purchase the book. Mr. Harris makes reading entertaining and very interesting. I can't get enough of Basil and Yancy...I hate to admit it, but I like Yancy's crazy momma, Ava. Keep up the great work Mr. Harris."
5,VISIBLE LIVES,Mr. Harris has done it again and the characters are as vivid as your own family. Basil and Yancy will make you understand the complexity of human nature and wonder about your own insecurities. As I read this book ( in 12 straight hours) I transformed myself to every location. I could feel the emotions of each person as if I were experiencing them first hand. The series of books that have led up to this one changed my perspective on lifes truths and who people really are. Understanding the complexity of sexuality and lies and what both can do to if placed in the wrong hands makes me wonder about my own life. Books are made to educate and this is a definite education in life.
3,"Good Read, but it's time to move on...","Any Way The Wind Blows was a good read, but the characters (new) weren't as developed as other character in the past, but I imagine that's because it's time to put the Basil saga to bed. The ending was kind of rushed and things were kind of ""wrapped up"" but again, it was a good read. This would have been a good FIRST try for some other author, but it was a little beneath Harris. Again, I think it's time to put the saga to bed and try something else."
2,Disappointing,"I have been an E. Lynn Harris fan for years! This latest book was just not interesting to me. It seemed like it was the same old plot, nothing really new or exciting. Normally, I read his books within a couple of days. This one was kind of boring to me. Maybe I was expecting too much, but this one didn't do it for me. The characters lacked depth and the plot wasn't juicy like in his last books. I'd hate to stop being a fan and hopefully I'm not ""outgrowing"" his books. PLEASE produce something better next time, Mr. Harris!"
4,Just Fabulous!!,"E. Lynn does it again! He takes us on another journey through the lives and minds of our beloved characters while keeping us in touch with the old unforgettable favorites. Although I liked this book, I was looking for moreintrigue and a more electricfying ending. I wish that he would not have revealed Yancey and Basil's stalkers so that it would leave us wondering and waiting for the next novel. However, there is still more of this story to tell and I hope that Ms. Ava Middlebrooks will be the main character. She has ditched a lot of dirt and she deserves to be ditched on!"
5,AWESOME! E Lynn DOES IT AGAIN!!!,"E.LYNN does it again with this latest novel that takes REVENGE to a level only the most devious would be familiar with. The book proves to be quite exciting for both previous fans of Elynn's as well as newcomers to his ongoing novels. His writing style is consistently rich with just enough visual information to provide a bird's eye peek into the world of his characters. I love that the book's ending is positive on so many different fronts after a rollercoaster ride of revenge. THANK YOU!! THANK YOU E.LYNN for a nice journey to an intriguing and often misinterpreted world.I bought the book the day it was released!!! Keep up the great work!Trinice S. MosesMount Holly, NJ"
2,Beach book.,"If you love E. Lynn Harris then you've probably already bought the book. If you are a new reader then get ready to be entertained. This is a weekend/beach book. It's fun but lighter than air. The plot is interesting but the characters are not well developed. It's the same ole, same ole that Harris has been tossing out for years."
2,Too Soapy,"Starts out running, with the story breezing along - a lot of sass and sex. Then it hits a wall. Every male character fits the exact same description, like they were poured from a mold. Stilted dialogue that sounds like a poorly written soap opera with huge declaritive statements that grate on the ear. Then everything is wrapped up in a preachy little bow, very unsatisfying."
4,Couldn't put it down!,"I was a little late getting around to reading this one...the new release is out in mere hours. This was definately one of Harris' trademark pageturners. While it's not the classic ""Invisible Life"" became, I doubt we'll ever see that again. The shock is over! Definately worth the bookstore trip!"
5,Couldn't Put It Down!,"If you haven't already purched this book, GO GET IT! It's worth it. I started this book at 5:30 pm and was done with it at 10pm. I couldn't put it down. It had my attention from beginning to end. Mr. Harris had done it again. Another great novel. Very suspensful."
3,Good read but not his best.,"While I did enjoy reading his book, it wasn't his best work. I just kept reading thinking that it was going to be some really big bang at the end. Like I said, it was a nice book, but I don't think he'll ever out do his self like he did when he made ""Just As I Am."" I cried so much off of that book. While this one didn't make me cry, there are a few parts in here that will have you laughing.....read the book!"
3,Time for Basil to retire!!!!!,"I am a number one E. Lynn fan, I am in the store the day all of his books are released, however, this one was OK it was not one my favorites. Basil is getting old its time for some new characters. However, E. Lynn is still one of my favorite authors and I am looking forward for the next release."
2,Disappointing,"This book is as shallow as its main characters, Basil, Yancey and Bart. It just wasn't up to the standard Mr. Harris set in his previous books. The storyline was weak, we are to believe noone knows who Yancey's song is about. She is a major star in the making, noone can figure it out? She was previously engaged to Basil, a major athlete, not some anonymous working stiff! Granted, thier engagement might have slipped by the ""mainstream"" media but it would not have slipped past Ebony and Jet. Please!!!The ending was most disappointing, everything wrapped up in a nice little bow. All these very flawed people needed was someone to cry with. Not Jesus or longterm couseling.In the end, it seemed like Mr. Harris was just satisfying a contract."
5,A MASTERPIECE,"BRAVO....Job well done....once again E. Lynn Harris has captured the minds of his readers and taken them to another level...Many woman can relate to Yancy's plight with Basil and I am sure many men can relate to Basil's delima's as well....E. Lynn I take my hat off to you and I wish more success and lots of God's blessings....For those of you who have not read this MASTERPIECE ""What ARE YOU WAITING FOR""...Hurry up E. Lynn I read your books faster than you can release them. I give this book two thumbs up a boot and a shoe...."
2,"Stay away from ""Anyway The Wind Blows""","These characters were too shallow for me. From Basil, to Yancy to Ava, there's no one to root for in this book. This was nothing more than a cheesey soap opera. I believe in fantasy and escapism, as long as there is some trace of reality. I've been with E. Lynn since the beginning. His books have been on a steady decline. Where's the passion, sensitivity and character development that was paramount in his other works? He didn't give us one reason to care about any of these people. It was a quick, juicy read, but not much substance."
5,"Bravo, Great work!","A story I wished would never end. But when it did end I was completely satisfied. The turnabout in the characters of Basil and Yancey, were excellent. E. Lynn lets his readers know you can always change, your life is not predestine, you are the master of your fate. I really enjoyed this book, and am looking forward to the next."
5,Bringing the Heat!,"Alas, Lynn has brought back the heat! Any Way the Wind Blows reminds me of the excitement I felt while reading Invisible Life. It is a mega-page-turner. He's taken the characters into a new direction of growth and maturity; one in which we all can relate and learn. And as far as the adjectives and descriptives go...well, just let me say that the Lynn that I'd grown to know through his works is definitely back! The scenarios are painted so vividly in your mind, it's as if you're watching TV. Any Way the Wind Blows definitely brings the heat!"
2,THIS ONE'S NO DIVA...,"The best thing about this book is that someone lent it to me so I didn't have to shell out money for it or I'd be more outraged, if for no other reason than the apparently unedited and overused expressions like ""diva,"" ""stank"" and ""proudly."" Who's editing this book anyway?!Equally annoying was the fact that the author made no effort to loop new readers into why or how Basil has these incriminating tapes of Ava. Let's just toss in MORE confusion, shall we.Obviously Harris can write, as evidenced by his ability to hook the reader and keep the plot churning. The question then becomes why write pulp? As a reader I feel insulted that this incredibly superficial, black Jackie Collins [like] book blathers on about three protagonists with no redeeming features whatsoever until--miraculously--they all undergo transformations in the last thirty pages. As if reversals that pat ever really work!"
2,Out of steam,"I must say that I have to agree with many like myself who feel that this plot/characters have been beaten to death. I have often thought about some of Harris' depictions of blacks, which only seem to have honey or brown sugar coated complexions, butI guess if you wanted to refute that one could throw in Nicole. I have not finished reading this book. I'm 3/4 through it, but I just don't have the same zeal as before when reading previous material. I think it's true--there is way too much name dropping, etc. I have no emotional ties to any of the characters other than Raymond. Basil is an old has-been who in my eyes has not evolved one bit. Don't get me wrong, the portions of the book that I read, I completed in hours, but it's the substance. Invisible Life and Just As I Am are the benchmarks in my view, and this one doesn't even hit the markor come anywhere close. If you got some time to kill it's an ok book.D+"
3,Sad state of literature,"I was sorely dissapointed after reading this book. I enjoyed all of the previous novels which I felt were filled with honest heartfelt renditions and this book was a tabloid, commercial imitation. Abide with me was also dissapointing and I bought this book hoping that Harris would redeem him self but sadly it was not so. This book lack a strong and serious story line. The characters lack depth or purpose and the book is a tawdry slick commericialized imitation of Harris's previous honest literary efforts. I would advise him to take time with his next few novel like he obviously did with the first ones"
3,"Fun, but Short and Confusing...","Fatima, in person she must be great. You can dance behind her, watch her moves, and get personal help. But dancing facing her when everything is backwards is very confusing! I was able to think ""left"" everytime she said ""right,"" but it is still difficult to do the exact moves rather than messy imitations.As a ""non-dancer"" the dance routines and steps are fun, but the first few times I watched it I got more exercise wielding the rewind button on the remote than dancing. After several weeks I find that it is easier to keep up, and I do get a good workout. Now that I have a grasp on the routines I do wish they were longer, and the ""invent your own dance segment"" at the end were shorter. Overall, this video offers a good physical workout, and also a mental workout (reversing everything she says and does.)"
1,Disappointed...,"I was expecting this video to provide a fun dance workout, but it turned out to be some difficult to follow dance moves interspersed with music video. The three parts to the Aaliyah video dance were interupted with so much music video, that there was no continuous dance to do. It seemed like calling this a dance lesson was a gimmick to sell a music video.The fact that her right is the viewer's left is frustrating and you can't always see her feet. It would be worth taking the time to learn the moves and steps if there was the payoff of a continuous dance at the end but no such luck. Too many stops and starts."
4,NOT BAD....,"This is a good video for those of you out there who already have dance experience. The bad thing is its only 40 minutes long so you don't get much dancing done in it and she doesn't teach you the whole video, only parts. Still, I had fun with it!"
3,"Fatima ok, but not fatimatastic","This video went way to fast for me. I realize that I have the rewind button at my disposal, but even with that, it wasn't possible to cath some of the more intricate steps. Much of the time you couldn't see her feet, and they did this weird split screen thing which was way too distracting. The production quality was like one of those karaoke music videos that you can make at amusement parks, and as far as exercise is concerned, this is too choppy to get your heartrate up for very long at a stretch. There weren't enough songs either."
3,"Hmmm, not bad","I bought this video anticipating to learn a lot of steps from Aaliyah's Are you that Somebody. the instruction was good, bit of unnecessary blabber at times, without mirror-teaching it was a bit difficult to learn the moves. Although, as a training dancer this is possible but very difficult for novices.With Aaliyah gave short clips from different parts of the video leaving things a bit disjointed. Backstreet was good giving a continuous section of dance to learn. Value for money was poor, altho it does take a lot of time to teach a routine i felt that if the video had been longer than just a mere 40 minutes they would have covered a lot more of each routine. Overall, a good video for those learning dance, difficult for complete beginners and it should be longer!"
3,Expecting More...,"i just got the video and i'm a little disappointed. the dancing is really great but i was expecting the whole routine to ""everybody"". when i popped in the tape and was only taught the last couple 8 counts i was disappointed. plus there is no 'mirroring' but it is still really easy to figure out what to do. it's a good video i was just expecting more of the dance."
2,Not what I expected,"Dance moves are quite good but for the beginner would be hard to follow the steps.Fatima's instructional video is fast and not detailed.Camera angle would be helpful but not on this tape. She expects you to learn on her pace.For those of you who have trouble rewinding your tape on your VCR, this is not what I would recommend.Don't waste your money on this tape unless you are a quick learner.It's pretty sad to have this tape released without asking themselves if they were going too fast or not on this video.I bought this tape hoping to learn new dance on my clubbing but this is not what I expected. This dance is meant for bigger space and not one of those crowded clubs."
2,YOU MUST GROOVE WITH THE GROOVALOOS,"I bought this tape, watched it once and was done. I found out about The Groovaloos through search engines and THIS IS HOW YOU LEARN TO DANCE!!!! GROOVIN' WITH THE GROOVALOOS! It's hip hop, it's fun, it faces forward and back, and these guys are the best at what they do. AND the videos are a series! There's 1 & 2 and there's a 3rd one coming out sometime soon. They have an awesome website www.groovaloos.comI highly recommend this Groovin with The Groovaloos to anybody, beginner or experienced if you want to really get down wit the get down!"
1,Tape defective!!,I ordered Hip Hop Shop and Go Fatima. Hip Hop Shop is absolutely fantastic and excellent video quality. Go Fatima was such poor quality that none of the tape was viewable at all!Be careful buying this tape if you are from overseas as it takes longer for it to arrive than the refund period.Poor service from Amazon[.com] and terrible quality product.
3,"Good, but confusing.","I thought this video was a lot of fun, but there was one thing about it that bothered me. Whenever Fatima was teaching the dance moves, she did not do any 'mirroring.' Everytime she would say 'right' or 'left' I was forced to try to do the opposite of what I saw on the screen. It was confusing, but overall a great purchase."
3,"Good, but not enough","Fatima showed the dance moves from Aaliyah's vide, Backstreet boys, and this last part is this thing that she made for the viewer individualy. The dance moves are good. Even though she doesn't mirror teach, I could mirror learn it. I thought those moves were easy enough to learn for a seventeen year old. It really isn't a workout tape, no warm up, cool down or stretches. I didn't like it for the fact that the dancing is really short, once you get it learned. After you learn all the dance moves in the video and do them to temp on your own, once from beginning to end, the whole dance won't last more than ten minutes. So I thought it was just too short, and I don't really think I got my money's worth."
3,Sort of complicated,"This video teaches segments from Aaliyah, Backstreet Boys and an original Fatima routine. I love the dance routines, but they're pretty hard to follow. She teaches each segment and usually doesn't start from the beginning and add on, so that by the time you learn the last part, you've completly forgotten how to do the first part. Overall, it's fun, just geared a little more towards people who are used to dancing and learning routines very quickly."
4,"Funky, fun, and PHAT!!!","This tape was so much fun to do. I used it mostly as a resource for a dance class that I teach and ended up really getting into it. I love the dance to the Backstreet Boys song and her routine at the end is a really good way to show off at parties and clubs. If you dont know how to dance to hip hop music, this is a really good way to start. I hope she makes more videos like this. GO FATIMA!!! and go me!"
3,Stationary is ok.,"Sturdy units when kept in place. Legs have a tendency to bend if you have to reposition unit with any weight on it. For what I need, they are fine."
2,Save your money,Once set up it's pretty sturdy. Very sharp edges. The metal is very bendable. One of the horses was badly damaged in shipping. I was able to bend it back with pliers and a hammer. Be careful when folding them as the legs are prone to bending.
3,A piece of history,"Many of the songs on this recording are not available in sheet music, and although the sound quality isn't ""leading edge"" it makes me feel as though I am listening to actual performers back in the 30's & 40's, with young and gifted singers like Frank Sinatra, Jo Stafford, and Mel Torme, as well as others who are nameless or unknown to me on this album, and a delight to listen to. Manhattan Tower is why I bought this CD, and I got so much more from it than I bargained for. The illusion I have when I play it is that I am a young jazz artist in New York, feeling the pulse of the city and filling up with everything about being a part of New York."
3,MAD CATZ ADAPTER....thing,"it was okay, i guess. frustrating because if it unplugs while you are playing, you lose your game. i gave it 3 stars because you don't waste the batteries."
4,The Best thing for the Car,"I think it's definitly good that you can play about 15 hours in the car at maximum because you don't usually drive that long. But the 15 hours, fortunatly is only for the car, after the 15 hours, if your batteries have full power, you can play for 10 more hours. So in total you can play 1 day and 1 hour. But if you get in the car and you put it in and then someone starts the car it restarts. Lastly it doesn't stay in to your Gameboy that well sometimes, but that doesn't really matter because most times it stays in as well as headphones."
2,Brushes are too big to be practical,"These brushes are cool looking, but can't really be used with paint because they soak up a whole bottle of paint with one stroke; they're way too large."
2,Disappointing,Not as fun as they look and use up too much paint. Not distinctive...they all end up looking the same
1,Wont Open,Worked great for a while...Now it will NOT open which of course renders it into a piece of garbage!Look somewhere else if you want it to last for a bit.
1,Complete junk,"I bought this unit after reading other reviews and shopping around. It worked well for the first 6 months of very occasional burning, but then started acting up. The door stopped working, would open sometimes but not others, and then eventually stopped opening altogether. I might have burned 50 discs on this unit in the time that I've had it, and it burned fine, but the door problem has me looking for other brands for my next purchase. The Sony DRX 810UL has been a complete waste of money for me."
2,Noisy Noisy Noisy!!!,"Pros: Burner works great, I've gotten only 1 coaster in 6 months.Nice designCons: It is LOUD!! Sounds like someone groaning. There was some previous reviews of noise factor but I vastly underestimated it. It's hard to concentrate on watching movies. I advise buying another model or even another brand."
4,Great drive but replaced with the 840 already.,This drive does everything I want very fast and keeps doing it without breaking down. That last part is exciting as most computer stuff sold nowadays doesn't last.Ordering the DRU-840 soon because I need a second drive. I can recommend buying a used 810 because of it's durability.
4,Interesting study of Puerto Rican Culture,"Puerto Rico: Culture, Politics, and Identity is a study conducted by Nancy Morris which presents an interesting look at Puerto Rico. The study involves interviews with a cross section of Puerto Rican society and explains the genesis behind many important symbols and cultural heritage."
2,Wasn't what I thought I ordered,"I spent an entire night surfing the net looking for the best price for a CAR magnet. I settled on this...because of the price....thinking it was a car magnet. It's not. It's nothing more than an over priced refrigerator magnet. A very nice magnet, but I'm so disappointed. This was to be a cool present for my brother-in-law. I'm too embarresed to give him a refrigerator magnet for Christmas."
5,Asterix and the Tour of Gaul!,"First published in French in 1965 as Le tour de Gaule d'Astérix , it was first published in English in 1979. An action pact , fun filled adventure , Asterix and Obelix tour Gaul (Ancient France) in order to win a bet to prove to the Roman occupiers that Gaul is their country and that they will go where they like in it.The proof is food specialities from all over Gaul which is to be presented in a banquet. Naturally the Romans pull out all stops to stop our friends but as always (and as we shall see in the adventure ) the Gauls are irreperessible.We get to see what Ancient Gaul in the minds of the writers looked like . This may have been a parody of France in 1965!"
5,Short journey into the Psyche of French People!,"The humorous depiction of the adventures of the inhabitants of one small village in Gaul, (modern day France) which defies roman occupation in 50 BC with the superhuman power of a magic potion. Its full of beautiful visuals and excellent pun, especially the play of words in conversation and names of characters. Its gentle satire pokes fun on modern life, art and politics with caricatures of Napoleon, Shakespeare, Zorro and even James Bond!An excellent addition for your collection. Also very good introduction if you are unfamiliar with Asterix & his adventures."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"The Romans have surrounding the Gaulish village. Asterix makes a bet with their commander that he can get out, and take a tour de France, to retrieve a delicacy from each region, for a big banquet.They will invite the commander to join them, as proof of victory. Any form of transport will do, even if Obelix has to carry a horse. No bikes to be seen though!"
5,High-Quality Product,"I was looking for a few-watt solar panel for my little home project. The idea was to run a couple of ventilation fans in my house's crawl space, using solar power. Both decent price and thorough technical specs of CDT panel have attracted me. And this product really satisfied my expectations! Panel produces current/voltage as specified. It is sturdy, easy to mount. Thanks to its sealed design, it has survived all kinds of weather during the winter - snow, ice, cold, etc. And right at this moment, it is running those fans! Highly recommended!"
2,Disappointed,The unit did not come with wiring to connect to my battery. Instructions state that it requires a controller. I have 5 watt units that came with wiring and do not require a controller. I am disappointed with this purchase!
5,Dead Wrong?Dead Right,I think this book is amaizing.I couldnt put it down.I think it is a little freaky that Alex's Dad Ike dies but its awsome because Alex can live with Cam.I think this book deserves all the stars in the universe.I cant wait for another to come out.
5,Twin Witches Rock,twitches is the best set of books i have ever read!!! They are very good and you just keep right along. it skips around but only when right!!! it rocks!!! buy this and you wont be sorry!
5,Best Book In The Series!,"This WAS THE BEST BOOK IN THE SERIES!!! I am so glad we got to see Alex's hometown again and all her friends! Alex wanted to go to Montana after an urgent email from Lucinda telling Alex Evan has been arested. As it turns out, Evan is now in the wrong crowd, a group of skanky gangsters and put a death note in the principals locker. Alex also wants to have a nice talk with her dad...This was the Best Book Ever! Cam was really selfish and rude not wanting to go but she did anyway. :p"
4,Great live performances,"Djavan is one of the premiere voices hailing from Brazil. The music in this double CD encompasses some of the best songs he has made over his long and illustrious career. Every song sounds great with his soft melodic voice. He fuses jazz, samba, bossanova and many other influences into a very pleasant Brazilian style that makes him very appealing to the masses with a variety of musical tastes. The songs, Samurai, Fato Consumado, Eu te devoro, stand out as huge hits with the rest of songs not far behind, these live performances are outstanding and add a great dimension to his multi-faceted musical style. This album is a great addition to any aficionado of Brazilian music."
5,Another Good Cops Book...,"This is really a great read. Mel is a cop's daughter turned Investigator who searches for the truth about her Father's death. She's a defiant, down-to-earth heroine. I liked the way this book was written but then I love a good mystery."
2,I Wanted to Like This Book,"Mel's life is thrown upside down when her father's body is found on a lonely country road after he committed suicide. But Mel is convinced that he was really murdered for something he knew. And when her life is threatened as she starts the investigation, she concludes she was right.I really wanted to like this book. The idea of an investigator fictionalizing a case appealed to me. But I was disappointed. The plotting was uneven, sometimes causing me to skim ahead to get back to the story. The characters seemed stiff and I really didn't come to care for any of them. The solution was satisfying, however. With a good editing job, this book could have gone from poor to enjoyable."
2,Hard Time Finishing It,"How did they ever convince Sue Grafton to make the statement that this author ""is a good writer!""? The story doesn't flow and moves along jerkily. I gave this book two stars because I did finish it and there were some entertaining parts of the book. I hope this author takes some classes and hones her writing abilities. I think she has something to contribute to the mystery and police procedural genre."
2,UNINFORMED AND SLOPPY,"The narrator and the author work with insurance companies. When she has an accident it never occurrs to her to notify her insurance agent or fill out a report to the DMV. Odd. When suspects are arrested they are never informed of their rights, they are interrogated for hours and hours and none ever ask for an attorney or refuse to answer questions. When the narrator forces her way into the interrogation she mainly yells and slaps which results in immediate confessions. And when the going gets rough she never tells anyone, preferring to not get any help from anyone. I am sure she is a nice person, but why does she do these annoying things? I don't know."
3,Almost heavy,"I was a little dissappointed. I heard ""Der Mann Mit Dem Koks"" on an online radio station and it is by far my favourite on the album. But the rest was just too soft. It reminded me of Scorpion meets Rammstein. It could have used some fine tuning with the mixing."
3,Serious Restoration,"This book has some good information that would be useful to someone who has never owned a Camaro, and wants to buy one. VIN codes, body codes, good information. However, if you want to see how things should look, skip this one. I was looking for information on paint gloss and texture, assembly techniques, and so forth, so this book was not very useful."
4,1969 Camaro Badging,I used this book to guide placement of badges and to review original equipment interior. The book is OK for this use. Assembly manuals are more specific at times. A good read.
4,Corporate Espionage Gets Some Press,"In my opinion, there are far too few mysteries and novels which are set in the corporate world. Perhaps this is because people who have little or no contact with the business world find the subject matter boring or possibly confusing. I find these stories stimulating because it deals with subjects which are so true to every day life. The world of insider trading can be very fascinating. I think Stephen Frey did an excellent job of making his readers aware of the concerns all stock buyers should have in acting on ""tips"". For the brokers themselves, the problem is even more fraught with danger as Frey suggests. Although short on details, the novel keeps up a steady pace. I enjoy that since I read to escape from the stress of the work day and every day life. If you want more detail, read Turow! Frey's books remind me of novels by Oksner and John Sandford (yes he did write some outside of the ""Prey"" series)."
3,Entertaining if you can forgive a weak plot,"If you are willing to completely let go of reality, you might enjoy this one. Ok, so the plot is a little thin and the characters could definitely use a little more substance. Still, like an action adventure movie where you are entertained in spite of the stupidity going on around you, this book has something to offer. It is a quick read and it won't challenge you to think a lot. A good vacation read."
2,Enjoyable but the formula is growing thin,Having read Frey's other books I feel he has gone back to the well one time too many. His lead character is basically the same in all his novels. I enjoy reading them but here's hoping he tries something a little more original next time around.
4,Best Frey book yet,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Unlike Frey's last one, this one has a very good pace to it and the story is enthralling from beginning to end.Some of his characters are very down and dirty and I certainly would not want to be working with most of these but they are certainly needed to hold the story together and they do this wonderfully.The only negative is that Frey tends to downplay the women in his books - Oliver's wife and mistress are good examples of this. Let's get some stronger women roles throughout his books.Overall, this is the best one yet! I can't wait to read the next one."
1,"Simplistic, poorly written, can't-suspend-belief-enough plot","All these reviews must have been written by Frey himself.These are poorly written books, cardboard characters.Some good info on insider trading.Otherwise, simplistic.The plot is not very deep, to say the least"
2,Couldnt finish it!,I am so disappointed. This book started off as a cant put down book and then just got slower and slower and more ridiculous. When it got to the last 40 pages I felt like I was reading James Bond and Indiana Jones meets Wall Street...and so many different things going on at once you feel jittery like you drank too much coffee by 2/3 of the way thru.
2,"""the Firm"" Rehashed","Reading this book just keeps reminding me of the FIRM. There is the naive young fall guy, who works the the evil controlling corrupt Traders, and just to make the point that he is evil and corrupt they link him to Arabs so we know that he is an enemy of the US. It's all overblown and rehashed to me, nothing new, nothing worth reading. My last Frey book."
5,Another great book by Stephen Frey,"This is one of those books that you get into earlier and can't stop thinking about. All you want to do is read it. It reminds me of Grisham's book ""Street Lawyer"".I highly recomend reading it...I think this is Stephen Frey's best book (I have not read Trust Fund yet)"
4,Frey getting better with each outing!,"I'm sure 'Grand Rapids' could do better, but I am impressed with Frey's storytelling and eagerly await this book."
1,Utter trash,"I found the prologue painful. The rest is history. Frey displays a rudimentary knowledge of high finance and auto-erotic asphyxiation for couples, and proceeds to bore the reader to tears. Worst book of the year. I will never read a Frey Novel again. By the way, this was my first. Trash, Trash, Trash, Trash!"
3,Big Dot sights,I did not care for them and replaced them with another sight. I have vision problems and think the issues were mine rather than the sight.
2,A stiff doll - not ideal for playing,"I purchased this doll for my three year old daughter, and am not pleased with her. She certainly is pretty and has nice hair, but all she can do is lay there. She is so stiff (the stuffing in her body?) that you can't seat her. My daughter wants to sit her in her doll highchair or in her doll stroller, and its not possible. The doll can only lay/stand there rigidly. I bought a doll for playing, not for show."
4,Lush Movie Music by Oliviero,"The composer of ""More (""Monde Cane Theme"") conducts this and other compositions. The sound is lush. The only drawback -- it is a shortish album, hence four stars."
4,Good Thanksgiving Album,"""Home to Thanksgiving"" is a good collection of mostly A Capella hymns and carols for Thanksgiving, with a harp and piano here and there. It is essentially a compilation of music from various albums on the Harmonia Mundi label.The CD's mood ranges from happiness of thanksgiving and harvest to a more somber mood of days past and things forgotten. The A Capella and solo voices more effectively convey the feeling of each piece than an orchestra or pipe organ accompaniment could manage. To simplify, there is nothing like the human voice to bring out the full emotion of music, consisting of shape-note singing, solos, medieval chants and rounds. Musical instruments make only brief appearances.Although not in a jewel case, the CD is enclosed in a well-made jacket with a booklet (printed on high-quality glossy paper) containing full lyrics and Abraham Lincoln's Thanksgiving proclamation from October 1863.This CD will bring out the true meaning of Thanksgiving in all its forms."
1,disappointing,"Gene, was way ahead of his time, he would have made it great in the 70s rock bands. I'm disappointed NOT with Gene Krupa, but with the quality of film footage used to make this video. most of the film footage is fuzzy, until they get 1971. They didn't even mention the movie""the Gene Krupa story"" with Sal Mineo, to bad they didn't use better and earlier film footage. Most of it was from the 50s."
3,Not sure,My concern after reading this book is did Orman follow her own advice to gain prosperity or did she gain prosperity from her other ventures? Not all of us can have a television show or sell millions of books. I can't help but question if her advice really works.
2,Boring Book,"I know I brought it but don't remember anything or what I did to the book, I know I got rid of it because it did not help me."
4,Good Book by the Queen of Personal Finance,"I have to admit that I didn't like this book as much as 9 Steps to Finanical Freedom and Courage to Be Rich. The question and answer format was a interesting change.Suze is the best of the female financial authors, by far. For more on personal finance, I would also recommend Rich Dad, Poor Dad and More Wealth without Risk.Suze's book is excellent at managing debt and money. For more cash flow, I suggest the 16% Solution and Cashing in on Cash Flow by Laurence Pino.I totally agree with the individual who does not recommend Jane Bryant Quinn. Her book is about 6 years out of date. Suze is the Queen of Personal Finance. Quinn isn't even a distant second to Orman.Nice book Suze!tcdefran@webtv.net"
2,For Entertainmnet Only?,"At the end of her TV shows it states For entertainment onlySo is her book for entertainment only???????????I like Personal Finance for Dummies.Some ""Dummies"" books are too simple and have to many jokesbut Personal Finance for Dummies is pretty good."
3,Better than Sex,"This is a good book, but I would think it falls short of being a Money Bible. I much prefer The Intersection of Joy and Money by Mackey McNeill. You can order this book on amazon.com or go to www.....com to learn more about it. Mackey McNeill is a CPA and national speaker. She was on American Family Radio today and what a delightful insight to my money. It was insightful and easy to understand what I need to do to find my way to money health."
1,Still don't have the book I paid for,Product never arrived.Disappointing.I give it one star because I have to.
3,Not really worth what I paid for it,"But it did include some information that's nice to know. My investment strategy is a bit more aggressive and this audio-book leaned conservative. Then again, I wasn't familiar with Suze Orman before purchasing this book. So all in all, I'd say it's a decent read for most people, though I would have probably benefited more from her ""Young and Broke."""
5,Suze has great practical advice!,"This is a no-nonsense guide to regaining control of you finances.Suze covers so many important topics: savings accounts, retirement investments, paying for college, home ownership, taxes, etc. that this book can be used as a resource for the rest of your life!Her helpful tips and common sense approach to bringing your financial world under successful management make this book a must-own for anyone making a serious effort to understand the best way to make your money work for you.Buy this book, turn your financial life around!See ya next review!www.therunninggirl.com"
5,The Road To Wealth,"Great Book!!!!! The Road To Wealth is like a winning lottery ticket. Suze's advice is a one-stop road to profit. I'm glad I put down my summertime novel and read this book. I thought I was on my ""road to wealth"" until I read what Suze Orman had to say and learned that I was probably on the road to disaster."
1,An expert on a little about a lot,"This book could also be called PERSONAL FINANCE for BEGINNERS and be just as suitable. It's basically a regurgitation of any basic personal finance information you can find for free anywhere on the Internet. Just search things like ""Getting a Mortgage,"" ""Managing Debt,"" ""Saving for Retirement"", etc. and you'll find near word-for-word similarities to this book.The problem with Suze Orman is that she isn't in the personal finance business. She's in the Suze Orman business. That means her time and resources are spent promoting herself, not staying up to date on industry news. The result is her information is sometimes completely out of date and in the worst case, factually inaccurate. She spends nearly 10 pages villifying annuities based on information from 10 years ago.Don't waste your money!!!!"
2,"Short, Incomplete Reference","This is one of three books on Windows NT and UNIX integration I now own. While the book did provide base level information, it was simply incomplete. Better books exist on the topic. Skip this one."
3,"OK, but not indepth","This is a good book covering basic issues ... but it is not a comprehensive reference that I would constantly use. As a system administrator, I need answers fast. Other books on the topic are more comprehensive. Still, this is not a bad book either."
4,Bulova Abbeville Walnut Mntel Clock-B1909 from Amazon,This is really a great little Mantel Clock. It is relatively easy to set up and very compact. It keeps accurate time and the chimes are quite pleasent to the ear. Nicely built with a good finish to the cabinet. Overall excellent features and good service so far.
4,Really Nice Clock,"This is a very pretty clock with an expensive look and a rich sounding chime, not weak and tinny as you might expect from a battery powered clock. The only problem is that the instructions were not very good - beyond describing how to hang the pendulum and adjust the volume, both of which were self evident from just looking at the back of the clock, they didn't say much. When we first powered up the clock, it was not keeping good time and would chime five minutes before the hour. I did not see any kind of adjustment mechanism, and there were no instructions, so I just manually reset the time every quarter hour, so the chime would match the time, and after three or four times doing that, the clock adjusted itself and now keeps perfect time. I am very happy with this clock."
3,They arrived,"These are sweet and spicy.. If you're not looking for sweet or spicy, get something else.. I didn't realize they were sweet, because they weren't advertised as such, so i found them to be disgusting when they arrived... They taste like spicy relish."
3,Why dont you have?,I would like find out if there are any repair manuals an a 1989 Dodge Dakota Sport 4x4 3.9 liter engine. Automatic transmission with overdrive. Include overhaul trouble shooting and maintence.
4,Great movies. the best of the best from early in Bette's career,"The movies are classics and the quality of the restorations is exquisite. My one complaint is that the ""Dark Victory"" DVD only plays about 1/3 the way through before degenerating into pixels, advancing haltingly, then stopping altogether. I've purchased DVDs on occasion with similar problems, tried them in multiple players, all with the same result. I wish quality control methods were better. From reading other buyers' reviews, I realize this is not a rare occurrence and I suppose it's a caveat to be aware of when buying movies on DVD. The other movies played just fine from beginning to end."
3,Not Widescreen,My only complaint is that there is no mention that these films are Not widescreen. I'm surprised the description is not that thorough.
5,10 STARS,Huge fan of Bette Davis. I have a love for the classics and this collection have many of my favorites of Bette's. Those eye and her sassiness always entertains me.
5,Betty Davis,Able to see the classics. They just don't make movies stars like her. I hope Merly Streep would star in her biopic.
5,Some of Bette Davis' bests,Love these movies - Now Voyager & Dark Victory are two of her best films ever!!! Great way to add to my classics collection!!!
2,"WHAT, AGAIN?!!","Each of these titles has already been released on DVD at least once, if not twice. Why do we need them again when there are still so many Bette Davis movies yet to be properly remastered and released? I just don't understand Warner Bros.' logic. They release those WAY-overpriced, cheaply-packaged Warner Archives DVD-Rs that are usually not remastered and with absolutely no extra features whatsoever and expect us fans to shell out the bucks and be satisfied with that. Why no more Bette Davis box sets featuring those wonderful ""Warner Night at the Movies"" extras? Now those were something I didn't mind spending a little extra for."
4,Please tell me they are planning to release a joan crawford dvd?!,"These are the usual films included in Bette davis collections,except ""Old Aquaintance"" yet its still a good film,i would have liked to see Dark victory,Dangerous,Beyond the forest and Jezebel(i dont like the film,but since is considered her best..) Now,i am REALLY Hoping for a Joan Crawford release,though i doubt one.It would also be nice to see them release Lana Turner,Susan hayward,greta Garbo,Barbara stanwyck and claudette colbert collections."
3,Hoops Review,"The book I read was Hoops. I didn't like the Hoops book all that well. The book is an all right book if you like basketball a whole lot, but I wasn't in favor of it. Walter Deam Myers has written plenty of better books, and I was disappointed. The best parts of the book were when the drama started--when Paul and Lonnie got in a fight or when someone tried to take Molly upstairs and have intercourse with her, without her consent."
3,Hoops,"Hoops by Walter Dean Wyers is about a basketball player named Lonnie Jackson. The main characters are Lonnie Jackson and his caoch, Cal. Lonnie's team is in a city tournament. I did not have a favorte character in this book.I could relate to the story because I play basketball. I couldn't really relate to the characters because they are city kids, not very respectful to adults.I recommend this book to people who play or like basketball.(13 and up)"
2,Hoops Review,lonnie is a teenager who enjoys basketball. He has a part time job in a hotel he feel /lost and alone and one night lonnie gets into a shouting mach with a wino lying on the basetball court. the next day lonnie is shocked to dicover that the guy that he played ball with is his coach. and i did not like the book hoops becaues it was boring and i dont thank other people shold read it but if they like basketball it would be a good book for them.
4,hoops,The book hoops by Walter Dean Myers is a really good book. It starts out in Harlem city. Lonnie Jackson is playing in a city wide tournament. His coach Cal that used to be a NBA player thinks Lonnie can make it to be an NBA player. On his way he encounters a couple of problems. Do you think he and his team win the tournament and become NBA players? If you really want to know read this good book.
3,Ms maldonado,the book was ok i really think that book was good but at the same time the book was boring and dumd that one part of the chapther that i didnt under stan much likey noting book in the the book i think this book is only for boys and they are wasting they time on basketball. i think that basketball is not my short is not my thing to work well basketball is something that boy's play with at the summer or they play at they game at school.well basketball is a good short when it come's to the guy's to play's yea they well play .
4,Hoops Summary,"Seventeen-year-old Lonnie Jackson is a star basketball player that dreams about making it into the NBA. There is an important game that he must play in and it will decide if he makes it into the NBA, but the pressure is high because some bettors want Lonnie to blow the game on purpose. Will Lonnie make it to the NBA or will he give in to the pressure? You'll have to read this action packed book to find out!"
3,book review,Hoops is a very appealing book if you are into basketball and know the basics of the game.hoops is a story about a young talented basketball player who is coached by an alcoholic ex-basketball star who lonnie grows to love and realizes they're alike in many ways. cal and lonnie get into some trouble when gamblers ask cal to keep lonnie out of the campionship game so the team would lose. i wouldn't recomend hoops to someone who doesn't like basketball the reader would get board easily and will not enjoy the book.
2,Hoops,"The book is written in first person. Lonnie's thoughts are given. I felt like the book was so hard to understand cause there was so much slang ""I really hates you your feets to big."" I actully could kinda understand what they were saying but it didnt really make any sense. I couldn't relate to it that much.I'm not sure if anyone would enjoy this book unless they talk like that. It wasn't just the slang, it was the whole writting. Everthing just ran together when I read it. I really couldn't tell what the setting was. I think it was in the streets of New york or some place like that.The plot in this story is that Lonnie is trying to make the NBA while that is going on he starts to like his friends sister mary-ann.I recommend this book to guys mostly cause they might understand the point of view of Lonnie cause hes a guy."
4,Tom's Review,"The book started out a little rough. It was really hard to know what was going on throughout the first chapter Then it picked up speed and got to be a pretty good book. It doesn't end like you expect it to.Lonnie, the main character, is on a basketball team and they're in a tournament. The founder of the league picks them to win it all. They end up playing the second to best team in the league and beat them by one point. But it's a round robin tournament so that team isn't out yet. Their coach disappears before the next game and they have to play a few games without him. They find out that he has been in jail. So they raise the money to bail him out. They make it to the finals against the team they beat by one when something very unfortunate happens now thats all I am going to tell you.The type of reader that would like this book would be a reader who likes sports and who is above the ages of 12 because it has bad language and is a YA book."
4,Hoops,"Hoops by Walter Dean Myers is a good book . This is my second book that I have read once again i really enjoyed the book . I think this book is for every body that could relat to Lonnie in the book, not just for basketball players , Lonnie the main character in the book hoops is a average teen age boy in a urban city who goes through the same things as the other teenagers are facing , such as drugs and voilence . Lonnie is part of a basketball team were he is the best player on the team . If lonnie keeps working at it and doesn't let money get to him, as his coach Cal say's he thinks Lonnie can make it to the NBA.In the book Lonnie also goes through similar things as other teenage boys go through like problems with his mom and some with his girl . If you read the book you will find out he loves a girl named Mary Ann but he doesn't want to tell her , because he has known her so long but as they got older they begin to like eachother .Towards the end of the book it gets really tense..."
4,"This is a good book,but............","I liked this book because I can relate to alot of the things Lonnie went through with his mom and friends. One thing that kind of confused me was that if Cal used to be a pro,why was he sleeping in a park. I understand that he lost alot of his money and stuff,but why didn't he get a job or something? It was kind of weird that and ex-pro was know sleeping in a park. And he did have an apartment,so why was he laying in the middle of the court? Other than that part, I loved the book and hope to see many other books like this and Slam!"
3,Hoops,if u like teen issuess and how to slove them Hoops is the book for you. Walter Dean Myers Focuces his books on teen issuess and problems. I dont like the slang in this book because its hard yo understand. the caractactrs names in this book is stupid. I also thought the author wasnt supicic as i thought he would.
4,Hoops...,"This is my personal favorite. I see that most of the reviews here tell the story so here's what I think of the book. Hoops really takes you into Lonnies world. Some times the book is somewhat slow, telling about how lonnie is just realxing looking out the window at a liquer raid or him talking to his mom and the rest of the time he's playing ball. I love how Walter Dean can bring you into the harlem streets and show you how it is to live in New York."
4,Hoops was a good book.,I thought Hoops was a good story.I never put the book down and I hardly ever read.I gave this book 4 stars because I thought it had a story that could happen to anyone.It was not a true story but it felt like it was how it is was talking about the ghetto and how he got into a fight with his friend and made a new friend in his coach.Hoops was a great book and I would recommend it to anyone.
2,"Awful, just awful","When purchasing a strategy guide you should expect nothing but full information on every aspect of the game. This is an example of how a strategy guide SHOULDN'T be done. Tips are not useful. The beastiary doesn't tell the weaknesses and immunities of any random enemies! Only bosses get that detailed info. A large number of enemy locations in this guide are listed as ""unknown,"" so don't expect any help from this in your search quest to fill up your monster farm. Vague hints are given as to how to reach the two bonus dungeons, but no exact info and it doesn't even give a walkthrough for them or strategies for the bosses there. Stay away from this, it's not worth the money..."
3,Just a little incomplete.,"When I ordered this guide I was expecting to find a detailed guide on every secret in the game from begining to end, however when it finally came I thought it was a little incomplete. The book is very good at what it does, it gives tremendous information about character classes changes, dungeon info (for the most part), and monster data. But there are a few things left out (I still havn't found the section on all the medal locations, maybe I'm missing it?), at some points in the game it says something like ""good luck and enjoy the challenges of these dungeons"" or ""there are five more shards to find and here's a hint for one of them"". I understand that this guide was written to preserve the storyline and surprise of the game, but it is a strategy guide... and I want it all. Overall the book is good, but could have been better. I found free walkthroughs on the interet that were more complete."
3,Where Are the Important Stuff?,"Yes, this walkthrough will get you through some tough times in the game, yes it does provide a walkthrough for each part of the game, but there are several things missing.1. It is missing a World Map! It is one of the most important parts!2. No Tiny Medal locations. It would be nice to have them all logged.3. Treasure Chests in towns are not covered unless they contain a important item.4. Pots and Sacks are not listed with the items they hold for towns or dungeons.I give it a 3 because it does give a detailed walkthough, but it is missing some extras we gamers like to have."
3,Where's Nintendo's official version when you need it?,"Unfortunate for Prima to not get all the information about how far this remake of Dragon Warrior III goes. They didn't include the Grand Dragon's Temple maps at the end, nor did they list ALL the medals that are possible. The locations of weapons and items are vague and have to be searched throughout the guide. Finally, where is the list of TinyMedal locations?I like the layout of Prima's guides, especially this one. They have actual screen shots which Nintendo's offical guides usually don't include."
5,Great techniques,"I really love this book. It has a great variety of relaxation techniques. I use the vitality movement series in every qigong class I teach. It is so easy to learn and very effective (in making people relax). I had a woman who learned it in a 1 hour class and was still practicing it every day 2 years later, and feeling better."
3,OK book,"I thought this book was adequate. Nothing more. It didn't go into depth on anyone subject, rather lightly covering each of the areas (movement, massage, meditation, and breathing). If you want details, this is NOT the book."
2,just don't understand,"this is the second book on chinese techniques that falls way below expectation. dont get me wrong, i go regularly for chinese massage (tuina) and simply love it."
5,Impressed,Dr. Jahnke's book is full of wonderful exercises and information to heal your body through easy movements. Well worth it. A must read.
3,The Healer Within,"The Healer Within is more philosophical than a modus operandi but, the breathing techniques & postures are fairly easy to learn and practice. If you have ever ever been exposed to martial arts, Tai Chi, or Eastern Philosophy it will be a fairly simply read and you could skip over some of the semantics and go straight to the exercises however, if not, then you will probably want to study it in depth. It's a little dry at first but, a good resource in general."
4,Its more about the Gang than for the bikini's,"A good performance of the gang saves the hole thing. Out of N. Scheridan performance wich is really a softcore allure in all of her interventions. The acting is typically a no plot just ocasional sex type. so it is a good one. And not a blockbuster for sure, but it saves its graces."
2,"Bikini Airways, an airhead must've thought of it.","So, she has inherited a bankrupt airline from her uncle Hugh Janus and decides to throw a wild bachelor party to raise $25,000. The actors stop to deliver monologues about themselves into the camera for no apparent reason. I guess this is their way of begging for work after being cast in this flop. The empty plot is relieved by some wild sex scenes standard for this series of films, but even they are ruined by our snapshot taking pilot (Jay Richardson) who wants to sell the photos as souveniers for ten dollars each. The film's cheap home movie sets must've not cost much more than that."
2,BIKINI CHAIN GANG,ANOTHER CHICK-FLICK PRISON MOVIE. THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST IVE EVER SEEN. YOU KNOW THE ACTING IS GOING TO BE BAD. BUT THEY TOOK THIS TO A NEW LEVEL OF INEPTNESS. I GAVE IT 2 STARS JUST FOR THE WOMEN. THERE IS SOME GOOD SOFT-CORE ACTION WITH SOME DECENT BABES. BUT THERE IS ONE THATS JELLO IS JIGGLEN IN THE WRONG PLACES. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DISC YOU GET ANOTHER MOVIE. ITS A MOVIE SET IN THE OLD WEST . AND AMAZING AS IT IS. THE SAME CAST IS IN IT. SO YOU GO FIGURE THEY HAVE TAKEN LOW BUDGET TO A NEW LEVEL. AND TO MAKE THINGS WORSE ONE OF THE MAIN CHARERTERS IS THAT SAME CELLULITE GIRL. HORRIBLE!! I GOT THIS ON THE MARKETPLACE FOR UNDER $5.00. LUCKY I DID. ILL FILE THIS UNDER MY DVD TRASH FILE. LUCKY THERE ARENT TO MANY TITLES. IF YOU BUY THIS DONT SAY I DIDNT WARN YOU!!
1,Who writes this stuff?,"There is in no way anything in this film that could even remotely be mistaken for hard core content. It was with out a doubt one of the most disappointing films I've ever seen and wouldn't even classify this as soft core. My advice to anyone who's out shopping for films of a truly adult nature is that they ignore the reviews listed by wanna be film critics who wouldn't know a good film if it fell out of the sky, landed on their face, and started to wiggle. Go online and find real info about the films you are interested in, or narrow certain studios that you know turn out quality work. This piece just wasn't even worth the plastic it was re-mastered on."
3,dont be fooled,dont be fooled by all the reviewes for this dvd it is not a double feature bikini chain gang is not on this disc
3,Explore the underbelly of Coruscant,"Over the years, Jude Watson has consistently turned out stories with action, adventure and a surprising amount of depth. These books may be written for 9-year-olds, but they can be enjoyed by Star Wars fans of all ages.In this installment, Ferus Olin's quest to find Jedi survivors takes him to the very depths of Coruscant where he searches to find a mysterious place known as Solace. The book's cliffhanger ending will whet your appetite for book #4."
5,Help for the Grieving,"This book is geared for those who have suffered -- or are about to suffer losses.More than discussing angels, the author looks at the Bible's writings on heaven -- how do people live there -- are they with family and friends -- and are they grieving, too? For Christians who have lost a loved one, this book can help.For those about to die, reading these pages may help them cope with a natural fear of death."
4,Sergio,"If you like Grant Jeffreis, you'll enjoy this book. First and foremost it is 100% biblical and true to the scriptures. Secondly, I highly recommended for new believers in Christ. And thirdly, despite the complexity of the subject, it is written in a very simple language which makes it easy to understand many of the referenced verses of the Bible. Thumbs up!"
5,Wooten is the best,"If you've never seen or heard Wooten, you've never heard bass guitar play. If you think someone else can do better, you probably did not listen to his stuff close enough. Victor is the best, and this video proves it."
5,Sold his soul,"Victor Wooten is amazing in this. This is still one of my favorite videos to watch and even 10+ years later, this video still blows my mind.Very cool video for any musician regardless if you play the bass or not."
2,Another professor's book,"I elected to read this for two reasons: First, it was said to be the seminal work on Libertarian philosophy; and, second, it was supposedly the intellectual response to John Rawls, for whose writings I have very negative views. I was able to get through a very few pages when it became apparent that Nozick and Rawls are a matched set--they just have a philosophical difference. But both of them write only to impress, as do far too many Harvard professors.I try to think of the reader who might like this book. So far I can't come up with one, with the possible exception of someone trying to understand Rawls. It's easier, and just as educational, to just give up on Rawls and look elsewhere for Libertarian material."
3,Deep economics and philosophy.,Very philosophical and deep. Hard to continually engage on the level of the author. Reading this book is hard work.
5,"A better introduction to the ""minimal state"" than Ayn Rand","Nozick's book is lucid, readable, and non-polemical. Even better, he's not out to start a personality cult around himself. He's very exceptional among the ""ivory tower"" types, most of whom are his diametric opposite when it comes to politics (hint: they're Marxists -- and what's worse, they're post-Soviet collapse Marxists, which tells you something right there). But if you like to argue with statists (i.e., people who think government's power is more important than individual rights -- how else can one justify taking wealth from those who produce it and giving it to those who refuse to work?), you'll find plenty of ammunition here."
2,A review,"I think it rather humorous that the August 13th reviewer has the gumption to ground his authority on AS&U on a college course s/he took as a junior. In the words of the August 9th reviewer, ""Ooh, convincing."" Take it from someone who has a degree in philosophy from UC Berkeley: the critical assessments by the Aug. 9th reviewer are for the most part accurate, though by no means a complete list of the faults of Nozick. The reason I give the book two stars instead of one is that the Aug. 13th reviewer was right about one thing. AS&U is a very necessary book in the ongoing debates of political philosophy. It shows us what not to believe and why."
2,If you have a Master's Degree...,"I have read many books on philosophy and political science and this is the first I had to give up on completing. It was written as a textbook for someone working on their doctorate and not the average layman. Without a doubt, Mr. Nozick is knowledgeable in his field but this work doesn't help a broad audience in understanding it. Very sad."
3,Viscous or Brilliant?,"When I neared the end of this book, I was learning so much, I couldn't believe how I drudged through it in the beginning. Except that I did so for a reason.This book is divided into 10 chapters. The first 6 answer claims of anarchists--they establish the existence of the state as legitimate. These 6 chapters are tedious, tedious reading. To be honest, I got very little out of them. Yet, you have to read these to be able to understand the rest of the book (sadly).The reason? Chapters 7-10 are flat out GREAT. He crushes the welfare state beautifully, humiliates Marxism, and so on. Excellent stuff. I got tons out of these chapters.So, half of this book is tedious drudgery (though still very brilliant stuff, to be sure), while the other half is very beneficial and enjoyable.Recommended, with conditions."
5,Get cozy and float away into a brillant world,"Theodore Nottingham has a gift I've seen in few people,writers or whomever.His words flow,they make your imagination roam to places you probably haven't been to before.Get this book,great for a cold winter night, also releaves tension,if you've had a tough day at the office,you'll forget all about it!"
1,Water Bearer Films are crooks,"In a little product review/rant for the second (other) Water Bearer box set of Pasolini films, I wrote more at length about the general problems with this label's fly-by-night, incompetent, unconscionable handling of these excellent films by this master filmmaker. Scott Richardson's review of this set is helpful, but he's still too generous, I think. Money should not be given to a company that apparently doesn't even watch the final DVD image of a film before releasing shoddy goods in order to make a quick buck. Cinephiles are obligated to not purchase this completely slipshod edition. Four/five-star films, but a one-star product. Why give money to people who insult you?"
5,Love it,Found It very factual and written in great style. Would recommend it to anyone who loves history and who has lived in that era..
3,3.5 stars: Live version of 'Songs from the lions cage',"With 'Welcome to the Stage' the prog rock act Arena presents a live version of their album 'Songs from the lions cage' along with three other tracks (""The Healer"", ""Sirens"" and ""Medusa"") accompanying and the ""William Tell Overture"" starting the set in a very 'Gazza Ladra'-like fashion, so make sure you like their studio work before you get this album. They display a lot of strength and their lead man does remind of Fish more than once. Overall this album deserves 3.5 stars. I don't see much point for it (it doesn't add too much musically to their work) yet it's not quite average."
2,tend to hold odor,"Using these for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. They function well enough and stay on as needed.The problem is that they attain an odor, and washing them doesn't help. Seems that they aren't chemically treated properly--my other equipment from other companies doesn't have this problem."
3,id expect more,i like this crew but the disc is lacking.peep afroman and rap with a live funk band. reppin the streetteam
3,decent,"i was really expecting more of this album after the hit single ""my band"". i thought the songs would be a lot better. some of the songs arent that bad and i can listen to them but a lot of them are just regular songs, nothing special about them. i recomend just downloading some of the good songs."
2,"Good rapping, bad editing.","This CD is tight as heck, but the edited version is terrible. But I'll give my review of the unedited version, even though my two stars are for the edited. I'd give the unedited 4.Best Songs:My Band: 4/5. You all know this oneKeep Talkin':4.5/540 Oz: 5/5. Tight songAnd the best song on the album is:Good Die Young, of course. 5/5, this song almost makes me cry every time I listen to it."
1,wow,Damn this album is a huge let down. Songs range from mediocre to plain wack. This is not a good album
5,Much better than the first!,"Ok, listen, it even took me some time to really get into the first D12 album. I was a little disturbed by some of the Bizarre's lyrics, but I gave the whole album a chance... Well, then I was able to pick the album up this last year at a record store that was going out of business. Devil's night was just a compromise of tracks aimed to piss people off, more as a joke I would say. Yet, I find every track on the album has some truth behind it. I mean listen to the lyrics of Revelation, (intriguing to say the least).Well, so I got a sneak peak of this album from MTV, and the singles from Napster...and let me tell you, D12World is very, very good!! I have it ordered on amazon.com, and it will be arriving in a week or so....Can't wait :) Best song on album ""Get my Gun"" Best beat, and best lyrical arrangement by all members. If you like hardcore rap like I do, then grab this album when it hits stores April 27. You won't be disappointed.(...)"
3,What A Dumb Ass.....,"Yo jlennonfan4,NEWS FLASH!!!Guess what? The reason Eminem and D12 made the song ""My Band"" was to poke fun at the fact that a lot of people think that D12 is a band... I think that Eminem and D12 have been long enough in the business to know that they're a rap group, don't you? Maybe not, since you weren't able to pick up the main point of the song... I suggest you listen carefully and pay more attention the next time you criticize something....Peace out......"
4,No one holds a candle to Eminem,"I'll buy anything Eminem does, and this CD is fantastic. The opening song 'Git Up' is powerful, and 'My Band' is absolutely hilarious. I am loving the bonus DVD you get with extra footage and the video to 'My Band'. There is simply no rapper that comes close to Eminem. His clever lyrics never cease to amaze me, and I am in love with his very strong, distinctive voice. He only gets better and better with time. And, oh yeah, D12 is great too. :) Sorry to say it, but the song 'My Band' says it all...at least for me. I bought this CD because it features Eminem."
5,Real Eminem Fan,"The new D12 CD is good. If you were a fan of the 8 mile soundtrack and Eminem Show, you won't be dissapointed with this CD. For the most part the beats are good, and the lyrics flow well. Sure there are a couple ""dumb"" songs, but on every CD that Eminem has ever put out, there are always at least a couple goofy/funny diss songs (""My Band"" for one). Don't let ""My Band"" be the reason you don't buy this CD. This album seriously only has like 3 or 4 bad songs. The producing is amazing like usual, as is the direction of this album. I give it a 5/5."
2,WOW white boy meets black boys,"Ok ok...sounds like he thinks he has to be the best of the best in that song My Band. What was he thinkin when makin that song...its all about him and how great he is. Its just another Em CD, and if you like him you should buy the CD!"
3,RapObsessed yes STILL openminded,"The CD gives a new approach to the idea of rap. We're a melting pot, and the music industry has evolved, way to go the D12 to stick out their neck and try something new. Those of us who have followed the evolution and history of music (more than just rap my friends, we're talking centuries here) know that chanes in the genra like this can makes huge differences in a specific demographic's pop culture, and ""pop culture"" CAN mean rap, as defined buy what may or may not be popular at the time. give the CD a try and you might be listening to a change of musical diffferencial history.And, you don't have to call other people stupid if they don't agree. Luckily, that's why music stores have many sections, not just rap. The mathmatical series (aka: why it sounds good) of music comes together with DIVERSITY."
2,Down-grade from first album,"Definately one of the biggest disappointments of the year. D12 came into the scene strong in 2001 releasing their debut album, ""Devil's Night"" a strong, uptempo, hearty CD from start to finish with good lyrics. Expecting a strong come back with D12 World, The popular singles, ""How Come"" and ""My Band"" came out showing some good examples of what was to come of the CD. ""My Band"" got old in about 3 days thanks to over playing it on MTV and TRL and the only good part that i found in ""How Come"" was the chorus, everything to expect from the genius in Eminem. Don't buy the CD, wait for Eminem's new CD to drop and buy that or get something new coming out this summer. Lots of better stuff out there coming out now then D12 World, don't waste your money and time listening to it."
5,D12 World,"Awesome cd, but the song ""My Band"" has been getting played like every 30 mins. or so and it is already getting annoying. All and all I would buy the cd again, it is well worth it because the song ""My Band"" is actually one of the weakest songs on the cd. So go with what ya feel but if ya like D12 this is a must have cd."
3,A small step backwards,"With such a great debut album as D12 had with Devil's Night you almost had a feeling that the sophmore LP couldn't stand up to its predecessor. Although its not as good from track one to the end as Devil's Night, D12 World is not a bad album by any means. Very few songs disappointed me. But I mean c'mon with a 3 year wait between albums, there definately should be no songs that lack. The beats are not nearly as good as Devil's Night, but that don't mean they're bad neither.Almost all the hooks are annoying. Compared to the ""rap"" that's on the radio this is leagues above it. Best songs on this album are loyalty, 6 in the morning, how come, leave dat boy alone(which i seem to be the only person who likes this song), american psycho(personal favorite), and good die young. Someone earlier claimed that the Bugz 97 verse was a freestyle, not quite. It was his verse from a D-12 song Desperados not a freestyle. Although not quite a classic, still worth my $10."
1,disappointing!!! and not helping rap at all!,"what happened? ""Devil's Night"" was so good! and this is just plain wack n disappointing, eminem has just had his worst year of music.. this album sux along with ""Encore"". i luv em but he just doesnt do it like he used 2 anymore.okay back to ""D12 World"" now, it isnt a good listen, it was hard 2 try like a few songs but i do not mind a couple....""My Band"" i used 2 luv when it came out but it was way overplayed! but since i did like it, i dont mind it...""Git Up"" is okai. and i like ""40 Oz"". i dont recommend this to any1, this is just my opinion u can go listen 2 sum1 else but i DONT recommend this 2 anyone!"
2,....whack....,"this is definitely not even close to a must buy if you wanttheir true potential go cop Devil's Night this album is garbagecompared to that they switched up their style and they came upwhack the only good songs on here are ""How Come"", American Pyscho & ""Git Up"" everything else especially ""My Band"" is horrible literally.....this gets 2 stars because the songs I mentioned held it up& some of the beats are pretty good"
2,only four good songs - mediocre and stupid rap.,"eminem is very good - but none of that shines on this album! There are four very good songs though, and the rest are very bad. They are: ""Just Like U"" ""I'll Be Damned"" ""U R The One"" and ""How Come"". Kanye West, Nas, Lauryn Hill and others are much better rap!"
2,Eminem Filler (With Very Little of Eminem),"It's great to see that Eminem holds it down for the guys he came up with, especially since they are holding him back and lack serious talent. Now there are a few funny tracks (Em's verse of `Get My Gun') and D12 does what it didn't do on its debut release: get serious. And when they do the Dirty Dozen actually produces pretty solid tracks with `How Come' and `Good Die Young'. However, Eminem is barely featured on the CD (unlike `Devil's Night') and that leaves the other five members to struggle their way through a full-length album. Though members like Proof and Kuniva have some talent on the mic, the CD is a disappointment and D12 continues to prove to be filler for hardcore Eminem fans.(2/5 mics)"
4,Adding to the d12 Eminem dramya,"Good album so far. Need to listen to it more, but recommend album at least for its humorous slant. Refreshing hearing people who don't take themselves so seriously."
3,"Tight, but not as good as classic D12","Before 50 Cent and G Unit came along, there was the raw D12. Devils night was one of the most controversial CDs of the new century and was incredibly dope. Their second CD lacks the originality of Devil's Night. The beats all sound the same and the lyrics get repetitive (various lists of ways to kill somebody). There are some good songs, but all it's just not as good as Devil's Night."
2,Save Your Money,"I just listened to the entire D-12 ""D-12 World"" cd and honestly, IT SUCKS. The facts are that Eminem is a LESS then spectuclar producer and that the members of D-12 (outside of Proof) are average/below average at best (Bizaar has NO BUSINESS on a mic). The fact that Eminem is TRYING to be gangster really tarnishes him. I believe he is too talented to TRY to come off like a 50 Cent wannabe.""Devils Night"" only sold 2 million copies (low considering Eminem is in the group) and I do not expect this cd do to much better. There is not one song on this cd I would consider a hit. ""My Band"" is a stupid god awful song. The BEST song on this cd is ""Good Die Young"". Definately not saying much.I would recommend burning this cd off a friend. Save your money, it's not worth going out and buying unless your a DIEHARD D-12/Eminem fan."
3,It's Tight...,"I heard this album a week before it came out and i didn't believe it was the real thing until i saw the track list on mtv the leak. i thought it was wack when i got the bootleged version but when i found out it was the final cut i thought it was tight. i like d12, its not better than the first album,see you at devel's night 2MIC-E Hanes"
3,D12 WORLD,"this cd is pretty good!!!its not the best CD out thereit has alot of tracks and the singles are goodTOP 5 SONGS:1.) git up- great beat, great begginer song2.) loyalty- obie trice is incredible on dis song, his lyrics are great3.) how come- 2nd single- great beat, good lyrics4.) b****- talks about the ladies and how they can be problems sometimes, good beat, everyone is involved in dis song5.) 40oz- great beat, this song just pumps me up!!!! ok lyrics and, one of the best on da CDOVERALL RATING OUT OF 10:BEATS: 7/10LYRICS:6/10FEATURES:2/10 *** they should of got more guest appearances, like g-unit or other artists from shady recordsOVERALL:7/10ITS A OKAY CD"
2,The Morning After,"Seeming like a million years ago, this substandard sophomore album by Eminem's tag alongs, leaves us wishing for Devil's night. I was very suprised by that first album. It was creative but not searching, violent and crude and sick and new. D 12 World meets none of these requirements. Most of the songs are like, eh. Most of them are like, ""big deal"". I was bored by the time my band came on and it isn't even that good of a song. Poor your forty out was decent, but I kept waiting for lil' John to come on the track. Steal this album if you get a chance because if you buy it D 12 will owe you."
4,It is a good one,I got this CD because I like Eminem. He did a good job with this group... I like this CD a lot.
3,editing is overboard,"this is a good cd.. d12 is funny and can be serious. there good, especially with eminem. the bad thing about this cd is the editing is too edited! its like buying a cd with like 15 skips per average song. but if ur the kinda person who likes not having any bad words at all pretty much. then git it.best songs. how come,my band,40 oz, dude"
3,What ever happened to funny as hell LOL skits....,"...part of the whole reason I liked Devil's Night was cause of the funny-ass skits...ESPECIALLY ""STEVE BERMAN""...and this just ain't the same...but I still looooooooove My Band,40 Oz. & How Come(plus the videos for all the previous songs are awesome)."
4,D-12 - D12 World,"Worth the listen and worth the purchase. Better than ""Devils Night""? No its not. But its still good. This album seemed a little rushed, but its still bangin. The songs in my top 5 are the good ones. Great production still, and the lyrics are about the same as Devils Night. Not necessarily as crazy though, they seemed a little mellowed out more, but still got some good lines here and there. Check this album out, good stuff from the Shady camp. If you dont know which D-12 album to get out of this one or ""Devils Night"", then get Devils Night first, its better.My Top 5 Songs1.Loyalty2.Get My Gun3.40 OZ4.Bugz 97 (R.I.P BUGZ!)5.Good Die Young"
1,PURE CRAP!!!!!!!,I want my money back. This is the worst crap i have ever heard. This is not music. What the hell is emenim thinking messing with these no talent retards???? Give it up D12 cause you guys suck. I could make a better album then this in one day. Anyone who thinks this album is worth buying has got to be smoking something.
2,less than impressed,"Em went to far on this one. It's too dark and fast. You get exhausted just listenin to it. Every song is about f**cking and pistol whippin', way to repetitive. All the beats are similar except from a few. The only enjoyment i got from this album was the comical lyrics from Bizzie. Not worth the time it takes to download it let alone the money to buy it. Trust me!"
5,Phat CD,"this is a mad good CD. if you like hip hop, than get this (or download it illegally). anywayz, ya'll know my band and lose yourself are good songs that are on here, and w.e. if you like it get it."
2,Oh yea,"Oh yea I forgot one:A tie for the best song on the album: How Come. You've probably heard this one of the radio. Em's verse is tight, Kon Artis's is tighter, and Proof's is pretty good, but the worst in the song. Thank god Bizarre wasn't in this song. Bizarre has good rhymes, but a terrible rapping voice."
2,G-Unit's cd was better!!!,"I like songs like My Band,Git up,How Come,but that was it I thought that they rushed a lot sure there last cd was much better what happened???Peace!!"
3,Definitely Not Devil's Night 2,"After hearing devils night, I thought D-12 was a sick ass group making real rap music but after this cd, they ain't nothin. Devil's night was hard and grimey but this cd is way too commercial. There's some good songs thus giving it 3 stars but nothin to really get excited over. Eminem usually don't put nothin out until it's perfect...well what the hell happened with this cd? Songs to check out: Git Up, Loyalty, My Band, 6 In the Morning, How Come, Get My Gun, 40 oz, American Psycho II, and Good Die Young. The rest you can do without."
2,"Eminem is great, but the rest suck!",He should stick to just releasing his own CDs. The other guys are totally useless and just like every other stupid rapper out there. Em is the talent and he shouldn't waste his time with these losers.
2,i liked devils night,wassup d12 yall makin it seem like yall need eminem to live cuz thw minute eminem get off the album yall soundin bad. devils night was a banger it was very good. this is i dont know man. im not feelin them right now and im not feelin eminem right now either. theres always room for improvement.
3,this is not a good album compared to Devils night,"compared to devils night this is an upset. i think eminem and d12 are goin into that mainstream way which is pissing me off with most rap artist. these days any rapper can make it into the game like no talent rappers like chingy and nelly. this album is ok there are only like 3 good songs on it unlike devils night which all the songs were good. this album is only worth listening to 40oz, how come, and good die young."
5,DUDE,if you dont wanna hear cures and swears hears a bit of news COVER YOUR EARS swearing is everywhere dont blame D12 or Eminem cus your to senestive to words other then then the skits this CD is great so give it 5 stars
1,Regressive and Tired,"Another hip-hop album with the same tired ghetto-wannabe lyrics, boring backbeats and childlike stabs at humor. When will this misery end?"
2,D12,I can't beleive they want $19 for this peice. D12 is trash they shouldn't even be making records.
4,it's good,"while reviewing this album you shouldnt be too serious, it's not a classic, it's not supposed to be a serious record.It's more like a bunch of friends rapping for fun...if youre lookin for something serious this is not an album for you, but if you just wanna have a little bit of fun, a good piece for your collection, buy it..."
2,"Below Standard, Poor Performance","Can this be the same D-12 that packed in witty rhymes in a non-serious demeaner? Well, I guess this really does prove they are only a side-show. Eminem has different production, so the group will have different production. Eminem went more serious, now the group is more serious.Besides that, Shady himself (or what is left of what he use to be) is basically a no-show. In any track Eminem's in, it's usually the strongest, and that is the case here; However, that doesn't mean he was great. That means the CD itself is misconfusion, contradiction, and a side-show for Eminem's next CD (""Encore"", which was better then this, but not that great overall, as well).D-12 is the commercials to the Eminem Show, everyone's just waiting to get in between them. That's the case here."
2,Its s*it,"This album should`ev been good but it aint.BEFORE I START MY REVIEW --- the majority of ppl that are going to read this are those d&ckheads who have reviewed this...so this will most likely get many negative results...but after u read this u will realise that anyone who rates this album a 5star hip hop classic one of the finest, is not a rap fan... ON TO THE REVIEW..........if you think that this album is one of the finest in rap/hip-hop (if not the best) then dont call yourself a rap fan. this cd is not too bad, however, there are far better than the majority of u idiots havent heard of before, and your saying that this album is better. its similar to the last album."
3,Not Better Than Expected,"I heard this cd when it first came out and i thought i would be better. It had singles like ""My Band"" and ""How Come"" but not as good as I thought. Eminem bust out some good lyrics but the cds just isn't that good. Not worth the money $$$"
3,What Happend?,Devils Night is 10X better then this album. It does have a couple of good tracks but it is no where near as good. Pethetic cd 2 come out of aftermath. Pick it up guys
2,Disappointing,I was dissapointed when i heard d12 world theyve gone too commercial this album is garbage compared to devils night.The only good songs on there were american psycho loyalty and good die young and the rest of the tracks were decent or just horrible.Dont buy this ur better off burning it if u want it that bad
2,Eh...okay,"I listened to this cd awhile back and forgot about it. That's pretty much how I sum this album up--forgettable. The only song I actually liked was the ""B**ch"" song and that was only because the beat was so cold. I hated the words. I love to watch D12 on t.v. Their personalities make them interesting, but on a song, the only people I'm trying to listen to are Proof and Eminem. Everybody else sounds the same besides Bizarre, and that dude is just annoying. At first, I used to be like ""Okay, that was funny but weird"" and now I'm like ""Umm...you haven't grown out of the attention-getting, huh?"" And Proof said he calls his mother a b**ch so now I'm really annoyed. I just recently started liking Eminem after the ""Mosh"" video so pretty much, this was a waste of money for me."
3,Review of D12's D12 World,"D12 started their career in 2001 with their debut album entitledDevil's Night. And now they've returned with their long awaited sophomore album D12 World(which deserves 3.5 stars.) Compared to Devil's Night, D12 World seems to more let Bizarre shine then any of the other members, which is its' only flaw.*I will rate the following tracks on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the best.*1. Git Up - 8/102. Loyalty - 10/103. Just Like U - 3/104. I'll Be Damned - 6/106. My Band - 7.5/107. U R the One - 8/108. 6 in the Morning 9/109. How Come - 9.5/1010. Leave Dat Boy Alone - 7/1011. Get My Gun - 8.5/1013. Bitch - 8.5/1015. D-12 World - 7/1016. 40 Oz. - 10/1018. American Psycho II - 10/1020. Good Die Young - 9.5/1021. Keep Talkin' [Bonus Track]- 8/10~If you like D12 you should definently get this album but note that it is not as good as Devil's Night.~"
2,d-12 sucks,"i can't believe anyone gives this cd good reviews. em is the only one on this cd worth listening to. the rest of the guys in d-12 are TERRIBLE. let me say it again so you guys actually get what i'm trying to say.... T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E. if you guys want to buy a terrible album, go ahead and get this one, along with the new usher joint, and maybe some ying yang twins or lil john. im tired of reading reviews on here that give good ratings to cd's that suck. amazon.com you guys should hire me because i've seen enough"
4,d12 world,"I dont konw what you ppl are talkin about emeinem bein racist, he is in a group with black guys. you ppl are just hatin on him. the song ""my band"" was not em sayin hes better than ne 1 else in d12, dont you ppl have a sense of of humer? this cd was off the hook, all of the tracks were great."

1,avoid like the plague!!!,"WHAT THE F**K IS THIS? IS THIS SOME KIND OF SICK JOKE? IF IT IS IT AINT FUNNY!!!when the single my band was released i thought o.k, this is rubbish but maybe, just maybe the album will be differant! BOY WAS I WRONG!! i know 5 other people who have bought the album and they ALL took it back to the shops the day after they bought it!! i wouldnt even use the c.d inlet booklet to wipe my a*s!! and the only thing the disc is good for is using it as a place mat for a hot drink!! and theres a bonus disc so you can use two c.ds for your drinks and the inlet booklet to make a fire!!!to sum it up d12 world is:1) poorly produced2) rubbish lyrics (even from proof)and 3) a waste of money!!gpo for some ""proper"" rap such as cypress hill: till death do us part, wu-tang clan, ghostface, nwa, mobb deep,royce 59, method man,tupac,b.i.g., even outkast is better than this!!!i am very dissapointed with this album!!!"
2,Not all i thought it would be..,"Im a HUGE eminem fan [and i loved 50cent's cd] have every cd,poster,everything u can think of. I loved d12s old cd thought it was hallarious but also had a good/dark side to it. i didnt like it, it doesnt sound like eminem/d12s style at all, i dont even like the beats to most of it, and eminem is only on about 4 of the tracks...=/"
5,D12 has a style that is their own,"If you don't like D12, you'll likely hate this album...so why bother reading the reviews? That said, if you are a fan of D12's raps, then you need to cop this disc if haven't already.Best Songs:1. How Come - Best song on the album. Lyrics, beat, chorus, everything. 5/52. 40 oz. - This ode to drinking 40s is an instant underground club banger. Great beat. 4/53. My Band - Its poppy, its cheesy, but its hilarious. Admit it. 5/54. Git Up - Try to keep up with Eminem's flow on this track. You'll fail. 4/55. Good Die Young - D12 needed to get this one out there. 4/56. American Psycho II - Your typical D12 track thats decent but not incredible, twsited and disturbing. Guest appearance by B-Real from Cypress Hill."
5,D12 is the group of 6 people that there is.,"D12 is the group of 6 people that there is. Good tracks like my band, 40z,I'm going to get my gun, and pshyo killer part2.Its been all round album to have. The album gets 5 out of 5"
1,biggest waste of money,I bought this cd thinking it would be tight but it wasnt I dont like the song my band I think its a disgrace to music I only bought this cd because eminem is a great asset to the rap game he keeps it real It blows my mind how record stores have this cd overstocked dont spend 14 or however many dollars on this crap instead buy kanye west his music is real every single track is good and you can take him serious unlike d-12
1,No,"Terrible, horrible, abysmal, poseur rap with s****y rap, crappy lyrics, dreadful singing. Eminem is one of the scummiest losers ever to live and now he tries to sing? He sounds worse than that Chester freak from Linkin Park, and that's pretty damn s****y. This kills the rest of his crappy band with the elevator music in the backround and how is he punished? He goes platinum and gets all the publicity. F*****s, s***heads, b*****s, asses, losers, freaks, you name it thats what they are. Don't waste your hard earned cash on this bulls*** from one of the biggest losers\wiggers\poseurs\scumbags\freaks ever."
1,I have no Idea why I got this?,"Ok well we all know this famouse song called ""My Band"" right well I kinda thought it was ok so when I saw this album at the music shop I said what the hell let me get it there are like 21 tracks on the CD so there probly atleast a few good songs well I was wrong!This album is a waist of money there is only 3 songs that are ok out of this album which is realy a fail to me in my book.Anyways Im just warning you guy's to not get it cause it's dissapointing...."
1,Is anyone else tired of Eminem?,I dont know what this guys deal is but every year he gets worse and worse. What is he rapping about? What is he rebelling against? Why is always angry? Whatever it is hes almost got me convinced that platinum selling rich white boys have it rough. But now Eminem has a whole new crew full of guys that dont really do anything but try to look thugged out in his videos. Hopefully Eminem can drop his own White Album and stay out of the game just like Jay-z for the rest of his life and make the hip hop world happier.
1,Eminems favorite flunkies put out another stinker,"The thing that bothers me about this group is that some of the guys in the group have some decent talent, but you put them all together on a cd and wow, give me a barf bag. Anyone who thinks their music is funny, fun, or entertaining, seriously needs their head checked. The sad thing is all they have to do to sell a million records is make a stupid video with Eminem in it, people are that simple minded, they would buy a terd in a box if eminem put his name on it. Anyways, enough of my ranting, just be sure to avoid this cd like the plague.The Zapper"
1,get r.u.l.e. by ja rule or da inc,d12 diss ja rule to much wich is why i dont like d12. theyre music is good but they dont like the best rapa ever ja rule. so they suck!
2,Very Disappointed,"This cd is a total failure. They have not brought anything new to the table. Devil's Night was an amazing cd. These songs sound like they wrote it in 30 minutes, similiar to Sisqo's albums. I think the Eminem Show is over, there is nothing possible to save this album. Except for the songs with some real producers, ""D12 World"" by Kanye West, ""American Psycho II"" by Dr. Dre, the cd is pure garbage. It sounds like a album that's half sucking up to 50 Cent, and half to Marilyn Manson."
4,Great Cd,"yes, i must disagree with who just wrote that it is a ""waste of time"" buying this cd, belive me, its NOT.. Deffinatley is an improvemnt from devils night"" Best tracks ( in my opinion) are My band (lead single) ""Bitch"" where eminem KILLS the first verse (thats the em i know!)also proof has a great flow in his verse American Psyco ll (produced by DR.DRE) that pretty much says it all) Get my gun (great eminem part im glad to hear his angry voice that we havent heard in awhile) 40 oz.(next single) mainly all the songs are good, those just happen to be my fav. also props 2 d12 for showing their fun side, yet also showing their sensitive side on ""good die young"" a tribute too their late member bugz"" who passed in 99. Still the cd doesnt compare to an eminem solo [nothing ever does] n also MAJOR PROPS to d12 AND EM for a killer performance that i was so blessed to be their on direct effect out in the rain!! you guys kick ass n if u dont have this album.. GO GET IT !"
2,ahhhh,"well d 12 fell off but we all knew that would happen just like beg for mercy was CRAAPPPP this cd cant come close to devils night which is one of the best cds ever, eminems still a dope lyricist but the rest of the group is repetive and all the songs sound the same the only ones that stand out are 4,9 and maybe 11 but i dont even know about that one"
4,very good,"this album is very good you woulndt be dissapointed the best songs are gitup,my band,howcome,b**ch,and just like you"
2,Only The Side Show...,"Can this be the same D-12 that packed in witty rhymes in a non-serious demeaner? Well, I guess this really does prove they are only a side-show. Eminem has different production, so the group will have different production. Eminem went more serious, now the group is more serious.Besides that, Shady himself (or what is left of what he use to be) is basically a no-show. In any track Eminem's in, it's usually the strongest, and that is the case here; However, that doesn't mean he was great. That means the CD itself is misconfusion, contradiction, and a side-show for Eminem's next CD (""Encore"", which was better then this, but not that great overall, as well).D-12 is the commercials to the Eminem Show, everyone's just waiting to get in between them. That's the case here."
2,Eminem's Dirty Dozen Dissappointing,"With a famous contraversial rapper like Eminem to lead the way, what can you expect but an album with heart-felt emotions, expert lyricism, and the promise of a hilarious smash single. Yes D12 got that smash single in the hit, My Band, but everything else just falls short of Eminem standard. I also have to add that Eminem is not even in every song. The rest of D12 are great rappers no doubt, but they are stuck on one topic throughout most of the album, Sex. It's okay to rap about sex on a couple of songs but D12 over did it. If you like thier hits My Band, 40 oz, and How Come then that'll probably be the only thing you'll like from the D12 album. But if those songs are enough for you to get D12 world, go ahead, otherwise stay as far away as possible and just wait for Eminem new album, Encore."
1,"Please keep your money, buy beer or something","Do not buy this cd, and make them think it's good. Totally unoriginal, and it doesn't feel like there is definite start or end. It's just a bunch of quickly made beats by Dre, with some repetitive lyrics. Eminem has apparenly lost his talent. If you want a good cd by him, go get ""Slim Shady LP"". Bizarre is probably the high point in this cd. At least he has some originality, and can actually make you laugh."
1,LOL,Racist? Haha.That's good.No one is racist here....they're just pointing out that this album SUCKS! and it will always SUCK! so shut up and DEAL WITH IT!
3,Shady / Aftermath / G-Unit Fan,"I have to say, I own everything put out thus far from the Shady / Aftermath record label and this CD is no exception. It came out today and I immediately went to get it.If you are a big D-12 fan, this CD is quite a bit different than Devil's Night. Their first CD is a classic... every track is good. On this CD, though, only about half the tracks are good... it almost appears that they are trying to tone things down a little bit.If I could have put 3.5 stars I would have. This CD just doesn't compare to Obie's Cheers or D-12's Devil's Night."
3,Good Effort,"I find myself just listening for the verses featuring the lead singer of their 'Band', but it is still a good effort on d12's part. Buy if u r a fan of Shady/Aftermath. Anyway, I give it my support. Oh yeah, check out the track 'Bitch', it's tight."
1,do NOT buy any d12,"d12 are mainstream what rap is NOT about, there lyrics are COMPLETELY wack, and the beats are just as bad. just listen to ""40 oz."" that song absolutely cracks me up....not because it is a funny song - the song has the worst lyrics ever none of them make sense AT ALL and the beat is pathetic, but the reason it cracks me up is because d12 cop what all the great rappers rap about. N.W.A, Eazy-E, DJ Quik, 8 Ball, etc, they all have there 40 Oz/8 Ball song, and now d12 think there so good so do the same, they probably dont even drink at all but think that since the ORIGINAL groups did it to success then they can. They make 40 oz bottles sound like a disgrace and that no one should ever drink. They copy esham and his group natas with the topics they rap about, but d12's lyrics fall WAY below natas and esham.The bottom line is - DONT BUY THIS TRASH"
3,"maps, globes, and graphs levelkc",The book was very informative. I just wish I could have order the student's edition of this workbook.
5,Mine,"i had the money and i wanted to buy a bombox with it. i saw a picture of this one in a Target catolog. i think what attracted me to it was the color, blue with a little purple in it sort've like lavender. i love this bombox because i can type things from the cd player to the type the it dose not pick up any back ground music."
3,Pretty Good Tale of the Apocalypse. Not one of the best of it's kind but entertaining.,"Based off the excellent short story, ""The Deadly City"" by Paul Fairman, arrives this interesting 50s Sci-Fier. The story is about how a group of disparate people awaken in a metropolis to discover it abandoned and that there all alone....save for some hostile enemy robots! Well directed and with decent acting, the film uses it's Black and White cinematography quite efficently to build isolation and tension. The Robots are both cheesy and imposing, if that makes any sense. This film could have been somewhat better had characterization taken a more front seat and the film didn't slip into melodramatics. The short story was highly superior in it's terror, and even if this is a low-budget, much could have been made of this. Still, not completely unworthy of re-reviewing, especially for Sci-Fi buffs."
3,"An overlooked minor gem, but NOT in widescreen","You know, I'm not one of those people who insists movies be presented in widescreen. Especially for older movies, it's just not that big of a deal. But TARGET EARTH screams out for a widescreen transfer from the first HORRIBLY CROPPED FRAME. You can't even read most of the opening credits because of the sloppy transfer job. It's inexcusable, especially when you refer back to the box and see ""Widescreen"" prominently printed on the cover.Having said that, this was my first exposure to this taut, cheap little invasion flick, and I was fairly impressed. The black & white photography adds much to the feeling of isolation and desperation experienced by the characters. And the robot is pretty decent, by 50's sci-fi standards. Heckuva climax, too. But you'll have to see that for yourself.Recommended for any fan of classic science fiction."
4,Dryer hose Legs and Arms!!!,I had memories of this Film since I was 5 yeats old. Dreams of giant robots terrorizing people left behind in a city deserted. I found the DVD on Amazon and after viewing it for the second time in 48 years I enjoyed it as much the second time around.
2,"They saved Earth, but not the movie !","I had never seen ""Target Earth"" before last night and was eager to watch something new from the atomic age of the 1950s in the sci-fi genre.The dialogue, story, special effects (even for the 1950s) was simply atrocious and the acting was horrible.Luckily I watched this movie via Netflix, so I will not waste my money purchasing it.Richard Denning seemed to be just going through the motions here and being a fan of his, I was really disappointed !"
3,Target - Budget,"This was one of those films I always watched and enjoyed as a kid. Its starts off with a great begining. It does slow up in the middle but the end, considering the limited budget and special effects - is still efective. The quality of this DVD is very good. The people who made this movie loved these type of films and it shows. ""Target Earth"" is worth adding to any classic Science Fiction collection."
3,"From Venus, with love","What would you do if you woke up one morning and discovered no electricity, no water, no people? This movie begins with that premise. The opening sequence is appropriately eerie but then it doesn’t take full advantage of it before gathering a few stragglers for what ends up a claustrophobic standoff in a hotel room (a pared down version of The Desperate Hours). Meanwhile, the military struggles with how to kill the invaders (a robot that looks like a child made it out of cardboard boxes). These two storylines are irritatingly divided in such a manner that it feels as if someone is channel hopping between a gritty urban thriller and a nonsensical sci-fi flick. Neither segments work to their fullest."
2,More like a Soap than Sci-Fi,Not much good to say about this movie. It has potential in the beginning but runs dry within 20 minutes. If you are more into the drama end of Sci-Fi this might work for you.
1,barely satisfactory,After having to wait now over 6 months and still now received the 30 dollar reward for taking out an Amazon Visa card ending in 0650 I have decided that Amazon is not the company to handle anything worthwhile. Vincent A.Sauer
2,Very disappointing version,"I can't recommend this. Gardiner -- one of the great conductors -- seem out of his element here. Antonacci pales in comparison with Jessye Norman's incandescent performance from years ago. Gregory Kunde is forgettable. Even Susan Graham, usually outstanding, can't really bring her part alive. Terrible costuming and hair don't help her. Clips of her Dido from a decade later show a much more developed characterization. In any case, she has to contend with memories of Tatiana Troyanos' haunting performance at the Met. That old Met performance -- with Norman, Troyanos, and Domingo -- is available on DVD, and it is riveting despite the antiquated recording technology used."
3,Period music- modern sets,"It is hard to understand why this production went to such lengths to restore the period orchestral sound, then dress Dido in one of Laura Bush's left over gowns. The Laura Bush type elegance combined with Columbine High School rain coats was a disconcerting design choice.The production tends to turn the opera into an oratorio, or a tableau-not-very-vivant. There are brief moments of effective staging, interupted by long dry spells.The singers are fine. The male leads, Gregory Kunde and Ludovic Tezier seem a bit stonger than Dido and Cassandra. The discount store evening dress makes it hard to take Cassanda seriously.As a theorticcal exercise, bansihing any visual suggestion of Berllioz's plot might be worthwile. This is not a West Side Story freshening up of a well known plot. This production strips the opera of much of its character and substitutes ideosyncratic choices."
3,A Disappointment,"Les Troyens is one of my favorite operas. I considered this performance and The Met's, but since I had experienced The Met's live and on television, and the Gardiner received very favorable consumer reviews, I decided on the latter for a change. I was disappointed. Gardiner's tempi are too slow for my taste. Those long, boring sections become longer and more boring. The sound balance strongly favors the singers over the orchestra - not what Berlioz would have wanted and not what I want. I had been warned that this was a ""European style"" production, but I underestimated how the dull and uninspired production would undermine the overall effect. The singers are solid, but that's not enough to redeem the enterprise. I'm going to buy The Met's, after all."
5,A must have for every dog owner,"This covers not only the basics, but also more advanced training. It is a must have for every dog owner. Written in easy to understand form."
1,Great information....50 years ago.,"All the gushing reviews about this writer being the ""father of dog training"", or whatever, fail to mention that dog training has advanced by leaps and bounds in the past 40 or 50 years. So when a writer is using fairly cruel methods to train a dog ( and causing the dog needless pain and suffering ) most dog trainers that a) aren't 80 years old, or b) actually kept up with the changes in dog training, are going to rightly dicount using stone age training methods.Welcome to the 1980's, readers - much better training methods ( and books ) exist now. Pass up this useless historic tome and spend your money on a book that works!"
1,Skunk,"Mop and Glo cleans well, but leaves out rooms and mops smelling like a skunk. i came home tonight and thought we had a skunk on the back porch. My wife informed me that it wasn't a skunk, merely Mop and Glo."
1,i dont know,some may like but with it cheesy n way low budget i didnt like it now musical was little ok but i was thinking it sifi like king kong it is person in custume just becareful
1,Boring,"This one is a real klunker. I guess some people like this for the camp. This is full-on 70's campy, but without any retro-cool. It's supposed to be a comedy, but I can't imagine anyone laughing at it. The jokes are of the ""unga-bonga"" type. (Those Africans talk so funny don't they. Please, give me a break.) Some of the jokes are offending, and the one's that aren't are just plain dull. The actors are some of the worst I've ever seen. If you're looking for cheesy movies, I recommend the Mystery Science Theater series instead. Give this one a miss."
2,Works for a short time then leaks,"I have 2 of these filters, and have been running them for about 7 years now. I have to get a new one about every year or two because one or more of the seals ultimately fail. Honestly the only reason I continue to use them is because the folks at Marineland are great to work with. They have promptly sent me a replacement filter or filter head for FREE every time I've had a leak, which is about 4 times now."
1,Don't waste money on this item.,"I have two of these units and every single time you have to clean the filter it leaks. The O ring has to be replaced every time. I do not change my media for 6 months for this reason the dreaded ""I have to clean the filter"" day comes along which it did this past week and you bet without fail the filter leaked. Fortunately the last time I called marineland to complain and they sent me several O rings for both filters and one replacement assembly where you attach the hoses and its a good thing they did since the hose section started leaking this time.Save yourself time and frustration and go with another filter, it is a good filter when running but when they need to be changed its a whole different story."
2,Micro Bubbles!!!,"This a a great looking filter. It seems like a good design, but every minute or so it blows out micro bubbles that make the tank look dirty. I have tried everything to fix it but nothings works. I am very disappointed. You would think Marineland would come up with a fix for this. Try another filter and stay away from the C series."
1,poor quality,"this filter is great in concept but not in reality! it is poor quality, the gasket on the power head leaks every other time i open it up and i have to re seal again. also the valve block leaks air into the unit and it creates bubbles, the valve block also got stuck shut because the ball valve stripped out only after a few uses and i had to purchase new one for 25 bucks plus shipping. and there is a reason you can't find o-ring kit anywhere!. honestly every time i open for cleaning there is some difficulty in getting it running again. marineland is part of the largest aquarium supply group and i expect better from them."
4,Wonderful introduction to apologetics,"Mark Brumley's book is a wonderful introduction to Catholic Apologetics. I think it's probably more than that, it's a wonderful introduction on how to talk about the faith. This book discusses the ""seven deadly sins of apologetics"", what do do about them, ""the seven habits of effective apologetics"", and a very helpful book recommendation for further reading in apologetics. I think this book would be especially helpful to recent converts, but I think this would also be helpful to high school and college age Catholics to help stimulate a useful means of dialogue and how to approach issues of the Catholic faith."
3,Must pay delivery to return,"Shoes quickly delivered,but they run narrow and cost $$$ to return. Will buy in a store next time."

4,ink cartridges,They arrived very quickly and installed easily. It took at least 6 'clean cartridge' cycles to get the black cartridge to not be streaky. I even cleaned the new cartridge head with alcohol and a cotton rag. I feel like some ink was wasted trying to set it up. I will see how long the cartridges last before deciding if I will purchase them again.
1,Junk,"Do not order. Ink cartridge says it has plenty of ink but your document looks crappy, as though the cartridge is low on ink. Wasted too much paper trying to adjust."
1,Not impressed,"Some of the newborns in this book actually look freaky to me and trust me, I love newborns. Not what I expected. Alot of pages show baby's genitals too, like closeups. Private parts should be kept well, private. Not impressed at all."
1,Coffee Table Book,This book has many good examples of pictures of newborn babies but does not have any details on how to take pictures or what techniques to use other than the picture examples. If you are looking for a coffee table book this is the book for you. If you want a book to show you how to .. this is not for you.
4,Good Plants,"When I received my order the plants were packaged poorly. They were clumped together in a big dirt ball and most of the stems were broken. I planted the remains in aLaguna Woven Fabric Floating Plant Basket, 13-3/4-Inch, Mediumin my pond withOil-Dri I06040-G50 Premium Granular Absorbent Poly Bag, 40 lbsas the plant medium. It has been 3 weeks since I planted these plants and they are doing great. I would recommend these for anyone looking for a pond plant that is easy to grow and maintain."
4,"Description is for the Nano case, not the Video case","The reviewer above points out there is no screen protector or belt clip as advertisted. Previously the description read, 'Product Description: The SwissGear Delta Leather Wallet for the iPod NANO features an integrated screen cover, padded protection, and wallet style flap closure along with convenient port access. Use the secure belt clip for easy access."" The lister apparently carelessly cut/pasted a description from the Swissgear Delta case for the Ipod Nano. It appears the description has since been updated, deleting the reference to the NANO, but incorrectly leaving the description which applies only to the Nano, regarding the screen protector and belt clip. Try again. Other than that, the styling is nice, the white contrast stitching is a matter of opinion, and the leather is fairly nice, and padded."
4,Take a second look...and a third...,"I was idly glancing through this book at a friend's house, and I thought, ""Oh, it's an alphabet book."" Then the father came by and said, ""That's a great book. It's truly bizarre."" Then I started actually looking at the pictures and realized that yes, it is truly bizarre. Each page gives the name of a girl (and tells what they're doing) but you have to look closely at the pictures to see what's really going on. For example, ""D"" says, ""Deidre practises for a career"" and the illustration shows her pretending to be the Pope. My husband and I were looking at it together--our favorite was ""Sybil is freezing,"" where Sybil is standing on a dismal street with her hands inside a fur muff, which on closer inspection proves to be a whole cat (her hand is in its mouth). I don't think this was meant for children (I don't think they'd get half of it anyway) but parents with a twisted sense of humor will get a kick out of it!"
5,Speak Peace in a World of Conflict,"Haven't started reading the book since we are going to use it as a book study starting in Januaary. The book was highly recommended and that is why we chose this particular book. The people who recommended the book had read another book by the same author. We chose Amazon to purchase the books since I have used Amazon before and like the convience of not having to go to purchase it and also because Amazon had used books which, I have found, are just as good as new."
3,The book is ok ....,"but I wanted to know how non-violent language can be used in a situation like the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, and in that it was disappointing. Hardcore Zionists who believe in their right to displace another people cannot be reached with reason and compassion."
3,"Works well, but a really a bit out of date already.","Overall, TalkSwitch is a decent system, but there are far better options available, for less money.I would suggest considering the 200 Series IP PBX by voiSip instead.The 200 Series supports unlimited extensions, and up to 32 simultaneous calls, right out of the box.It also has a LOT more features, such as Call Record, Call Monitor, Call Whisper and Call Barge, to name a few.The voiSip 200 Series is also quite a bit less expensive to buy than the X16 system.But the biggest advantage is being able to use voiSip's VoIP trunk service, which is FAR less expensive than land line service, and even less than Vonage VoIP."
4,Informative and Beautiful,"I bought this book after seeing one of Khakhar's paintings at the Tate in London. The great thing about the book are the beautiful color plates of the artist's work. Timothy Hyman's long biographical essay is very informative, but hardly a definitive biography of Mr. Khakhar. But it does give some insight into the humor and the emotion of the vibrant and shockingly colorful paintings. It also serves as a decent introduction not only to the artist's work, but also to the cultural and artistic life of modern India. This would be a nice gift for any lover of modern art or anyone interested in India, for that matter. Gay men would especially appreciate this book, I think, as Khakhar ""came out"" in middle age (after the death of his mother) and many of his works are blissfully homoerotic. But regardless of one's sexual orientation, this book would be a beautiful addition to any library of art books."
2,Entertaining trash,"Produced by Roger Corman STRIPPED TO KILL is a stylishly filmed, trashily entertaining thriller. The story is pretty basic: Cop Officer Cody Sheehan (Kay Lenz) goes undercover as a stripper to catch the killer behind the deaths of several of its dancers; and soon finds she enjoys stripping. There is one creepy spectator in particular who is singled out as the suspect, could it be him? The strippers all use the usual creative names like Dazzle, Brandy, Cinnamon, Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail who go about their biz while Lenz waits for the killer to stand up and pull his peter on her. Anyhow there are far worse movies out there. Like ZIPPERFACE."
2,Not the best,"This is a fun and interesting game, but I prefer action, and a game where you can get really interactive doing things. This you just take care of a dog, whic s great but will wear off. Hope this helps."
1,Why make such a boring game?!?,"This game sucks! I bought it with my last couple of bucks from my birthday and when I went to play it I nearly fainted! I like action games like Battle Arena Toshinden. Not very many people know what that game is but it is one of the best games I own. I ended up giving dogz it to my 3 year old cousin. You cant save either. So every time you turn it on you have to pick a dog name it pick a color and make it like you. There is no level s of play either, just one level the whole time! Take my advise DON'T BUY IT!!:)"
3,Fun for a while...,"Dogz for GBC is a good game for all ages. It is a lot of fun for a little while, but if you like action, it's not for you. You will get tired of it easily. Even I did, and I'm a die-hard fan of the computer versions. From the start, you choose one of three breeds of dogs (Mutt, Chihuahua, or Scottie) and take care of it until it is old enough to be retired. Each game comes with a variety of toys and objects to care for your dog, and one special toy is included in each game. To collect all of the breeds and toys, you have to trade with other gamers. If you liked the first version of Dogz for the computer, you will probably like it. For another game like this, try Catz for GBC. My overall recommendation would be to buy Dogz 3 or 4 for the computer, where you can feed, groom, play, and even breed the dogz. Hope this was helpful!"
4,Pretty Good,"This is a pretty good game. Kids who like a lot of action in a game, this is not for you. You adopt a Dogz, then you play with it, feed it, and groom it. It is basically the same thing over and over again throughout the whole game, and you might get tired of it fast."
2,de-ja-vu all over,"After a couple of articles written about the same period of Tarantino's carreer (which was very short so far when this book was published) I got a strogn sense of de-ja-vu. It's basically the same questions and answers all over again, and the book only slowly goes forward to the next film or project.I guess a book like this would be much more interesting if the filmmaker had done a lot more films and the book could do with only 1 or 2 interviews per period. This one was written too soon, alas."
3,chinese barbie doll,I bought this doll for my girls because they were adopted from china and gave one to them to play with and saved one for when they grow up to have as a keepsake. It is really cute. Thanks!
2,too small,"this bracelet is too small to ware, looks like made for little girl. From the image showed on website, we couldn't tell."
5,Awesome Feather Bed,Just like the one at Amelia Island Ritz Carlton. Fits under the mattress pad with no problem. I feel like I am sleeping on a cloud.
4,wacky and fun,"This EP from Cylob consists of several short titles (adding up to just barely over 20 min) which buzz and sputter along like an oven buzzer on a dancefloor. It's fairly humorous and shouldn't be taken too seriously. If you're looking for quirky techno with a sense of humor, Lobster Tracks is for you."
4,Sweet little cookbook,I was inspired to purchase this after I went to a luncheon and had the shrimp sandwiches. It is a sweet little book about the old south and Mrs. Whaley's philosophy about life. It ended up being a very nice Mother's day gift for my Mom and Mother in law.
5,for the I hate to cook crowd,What a joy to read Emily Whaley's relaxed approach to entertaining friends with good food and conversation. The humor keeps one turning the pages and the simple recipes appealed to my quick sessions in the kitchen. I bought the $17.95 hardback copy to take with me to Maine for the Summer so that I could easily refer to her superb selection of favorites. Both of Emily's books are great gifts for dear friends who enjoy gardens and good food....who doesn't?
2,A let down.,"A great concept, poor execution. The graphics are mediocre, but that is not really what ruins the game. What ruins the game is the confusing/complicated controls. It takes a lot of practice to do even the simplest things in this game. Also, it gets to be border line impossible to build the larger, more elaborate models of roller coasters. This game is fun for a day or two, than it becomes too difficult and annoying. A sequel with more simplified controls might be the solution, because the concept of a simulation theme park is not a bad one."
1,Awful Graphics,"Stay away from this game. I loved RCT when it came out for the PC, and was looking forward for the Xbox version. THIS IS A TERRIBLE PORT! The graphics are a joke, three generations behind -- approaching Atari 2600. Playing the game with a thumbstick is also very difficult.This is a shame . . . an awful shame . . ."
1,C'mon Atari,I think Atari should make this game for the other systems like PS2 and Gamecube. Whenever I try to play this game on my PC it says you can't play this game and returns me to my desktop.
2,too hard to play,"I enjoy simulation games a lot. I love Zoo Tycoon and The Sims and Sim City. I think I liked Roller Coaster Tycoon, too. I usually play games on my PC, I found this game very difficult to use on XBox. I don't like any games offered on the XBox so I thought a simulation game (which I already know I like), would be a good game. I was giving myself a headache trying to make my fingers use the right buttons constatantly. But I have a hard time playing any game on XBox. I think I'll stick with PC games, maybe I'll try RollerCoaster Tycoon again sometime on the computer, instead.So to sum up my review:Roller Coaster Tycoon - Thumbs tentatively upRoller Coaster Tycoon on XBox - Thumbs downThe XBox Controller - Two sore thumbs down, and one headache"
1,its not the best game,the pc one is way better.its hard and i really dont understand it .when i played it at my friend's house i thought it would be fun.boy was i disapointed!
4,"If you don't have a PC, then buy this game for X-Box.","I own this game for PC and I've been a fan since the beginning. Roller Coaster Tycoon is basically an amusement park simulation. Here you can create from scratch a new park or improve an existing one. It's actually a fun game, seeing your own roller coasters going around, all your employees in the park doing all the work you assign to them, and more. The thing I don't like about the X-Box version are the controllers. I really prefer the mouse and keyboard instead of using the joysticks. I'll be honest, if you're interested even a little bit in this kind of game, buy it, you can't go wrong; it's easy to get into and challenging to even the ""experts."" however, if you have a PC, I would highly recommend you get the PC version, it has more flexibility and it's better to control than the X-Box controls."
4,"Good port to the console, but the PC version is still better","I own both the PC and Xbox version of these games and still have to give the nod to the PC. The console graphics just aren't up to par for the PC and the movement/building of rides is just way too cumbersom on the Xbox. You can easily have 4 or 5 different windows open trying to build a simple ride. The PC version just comes off as smoother. However, it is still a fantastic game on either."
3,"Its ok, but better on PC...","I really like roller coaster tycoon. I've been playing it for a long time. When I found out it was on X box I got it and played it. But I was kind of disappointed. I recommend getting the PC version of it first in order to respect the game. Because it's frustrating to use the controller stick as the mouse, and renaming your rides take a lot of time because you don't get to use a key board. Also the graphics are not X box quality. I mean, don't get me wrong or anything, roller coaster tycoon in general is a great game. It's just because I recommend it on computer more and I'd give that version a 5."
2,Thought it would have been better!,"i don't play any computer games but i thought this game would have been the bomb on the box, because it recieved such great reviews for the pc. hmmm!, i was completely wrong. this game is really hard and i don't think that the xbox controller makes the situation any better. i think that strategy and puzzle type games are better for the pc because you can at least use a mouse to aide your playing. if the xbox had a mouse available for some of the games i think that this would have been a really sweet idea for the xbox, but since the controller has enough flaws as it is, i think this was a bad decision.sorry RCT, shoulda' stayed on just the pc!, i only give this game two stars on the xbox for effort."
3,Palm Wisk Broom,It served the purpose but not nearly as good as the one I've had for years. Didn'tseem to be as stiff plus the bristles broke easily.
3,Good broom,Works well but I question the longevity of this product. Time will tell. I recommend this product to others in need of a wisk brook.
2,Not a good choice for me,"Very nice product, but the bristles are very coarse and stiff. Doesn't get into corners the way I would like."
2,Bouganvillea,"I do not live in the optimal climate for this plant, but I fell in love with the tremendous, trailing, purple blooms in Italy. It likes dry, sunny conditions. CT is too humid. The plant is great, but the 2 stars are only because I do not have an ideal climate. Also, I rodered purple, and one plant is white, not purple."
4,Pappy Gunn Review,"After having read numerous books on the 5th Air Force operations in the Southwest Pacific (SWP) theatre during WWII, that made constant reference to Pappy Gunn and his contribution to the success of the operations, it was great to finally obtain an in depth look at the man. The book provides a wealth of information on the ability of Pappy Gunn to get what was needed to accomplish his goals of not only modifying B-25s and A-20s into strafers and capable of longer range, but to show that his dedication to his captive family was his motivation. This is not just a war story, but an in depth story of a very significant character in the overall picture of the war in the SWP.The shortfall in this book is the poor reproduction of the photos and the letters. The letters were especially hard to read and as a result, significant information that could have added depth to the story was lost."
2,Bass Landing Video,Nice game with a slightly high learning curve. Just like real fishing it requires some degree of patience.
5,Bass Landing,"This is the best fishing game ever. It is just as though I am in a boat fishing for real! It is a little hard to reel in the larger Bass,but with time everyone will learn how to. Can't wait for a part 2."
2,kaflooie,this game was a big stinker! I love fishing games but this one was too hard.It only gets one star but it gets two because the controller is really cool! Tight Lines!
5,For all of those who love to fish look no further!,This game offers realistic interaction and a large number of features. There are several lakes to choose from and every envirnment you could encounter. Even if you are a pro-angler this offers a lot of challenges. The tutorial will help even the laymen. Definitly a must for any fisherman or woman.
5,Fishing At Its Best,"This game is like real fishing, compared to the other fishing games I have played, because of the vibrating rod and reel it comes with. There is a chalenge for everyone, because of the four huge lakes, 14 species of fish, and choice of any weather conditon and season. I highly recommend this game for anglers who do not get to fish as often as they like."
5,Makes most other noir writing seem pallid,"Absolutely the most brutal, riveting crime stories I've ever read....the characters live in a remorseless, alternate universe which makes ordinary reality seem like a respite...I liked these better than his novel, FAST ONE...the closest literary equivalent to the toughest crime radio of the 40's, as well..oh, yeah.."
4,exhaustive insight into cajun and creole cookery,The man who changed culinary history (blackened everything!) presents a masterpiece. Anorexics need not apply! Must have addition for collectors of American Regional Cuisine books.
3,Surprising short stories,"This isn't Charlotte Armstrong's usual fare. One or two of these stories could be called mysteries, but most aren't. They're dated, as you'd expect, but marvelous in their own way. One story utterly puzzles me; the rest show a splendid grasp of human nature. They'll surprise you."
5,Great Video,"We were going to go to Russia, but had to cancell. So I ordered this CD instead. It's wonderfulgreat explaination of each place and piece of art, better than being there. Plus I get to see it in the comfort of my home."
5,Managing Little League Baseball,This is a necessary and inspiring addition to any coaches library. It made me want to send a fan letter to the author.
4,Great help for a first time coach,"Although I have coached Football before this was my first attempt at ruining kids Baseball experience. :) I really wish that I had read something like this prior to doing any kind of coaching. The chapters on choosing your team and dealing with parents are excellent.The drills are also helpful but other baseball coaching books are equally good in this aspect.So far all of the books I've found are designed for coaching 9-12 year olds, this one included. I'm currently working with 6-8 year olds in a pitching machine league. This is the only drawback to this book I can see.If you are only buying one book to help with coaching a youth Baseball team, this one delivers all the tools needed. Most are simply drill books (which have their purpose). Managing Little League Baseball will help a beginner coach understand everything he needs to get started."
5,Panasonic DMW-LW55 55mm Wide Conversion Lens for Panasonic fz200,The lens was received quickly and quickly tried out. Works like a charm. Very well made. The glass is beautiful.
1,Can you say home video?,"If I had not read some of the reviews I would have thought I had watched a totally different movie than has been descripted. I laughed out of control for every bit of 10 minutes after reading some of the reviews. My 4 year old son started laughing with me and he didn't even know why we were laughing. Who would of ever thought a Friday night at home reading movie reviews on Amazon.com could be so fun. Read them all - you'll see my point. Ok now why I am writing the review.My son appeared to like the movie however my husband and I thought it looked like a first time producer shot the film. The plots jumped around, the acting was rather poor, and it appeared to be filmed using a home video camera. It was enough to have to watch it once and is certainly not worth the asking price. Sorry, I don't like to give bad reviews but this one asked for it especially after I saw the price - spend your money on something better. The laugh was worth the price though."
1,This movie is truly amazing (ly bad),"Wow, I see what everyone was saying. This definitely has to be the best movie ever! Let me give you a few examples of its amazingness. For example, what other movie ties in totally random Animal Planet scenes throughout the movie while brilliantly avoiding attaching them to the plot in any way? Your kids will absolutely love this movie (assuming of course they were born without any conception of reality). I really can't believe that this movie didn't win the academy award for special effects (which rival movies like Lord of the Rings and the Matrix). Like the scene where he's flying above the factory. You can almost imagine that he's acting! The brilliant screenplay will tug at your heartstrings with such profound quotes as ""Mom...are we there yet? There are nothing but trees around here."" If you haven't figured it out yet, I'm being sarcastic. This movie was horrible. Don't buy it if you value your sanity."
1,waste of time,"Don't bother with this homemade boring amaturish film,if you can call it that.The dollar store has better. Spend your money elsewhere."
5,Havin fun yet?......sure am!,"Havin fun yet?...I sure did when i watched the emotional thriller Flyin Ryan! This could possibly be the best movie of 2000, case closed! Not only was the cinematography mind blowing but it also had an all star cast including: the talented Andy Weis, the very FINE Geneve Rupert, and my man Jacob Peterson who played Dirk...WANT ME TO GRIND YOUR FACE IN MCGUIRE! Woooooooooo he even made me scared! All I can say is I smell a sequeal, Flyin Ryan goes Hawaiin!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY,"My 11 & 8 year olds even thought this movie was lame! Where did they ever get such bad actors? Oy! It was like watching a train wreck! The idea of the movie seemed a good one, but it simply never gets there. It just goes off in another direction & you're left shaking your head. I love watching kids movies w/ my little darlin's, but this one was penance!Avoid this one unless you're a glutton for punishment."
2,not consistent,So far I have burned 10 of them. all successful from Nero ultra but half of them are having different kinds of problems while reading the disc. I have three different dvd players.no problem at all with Memorex disc.I bought this because I try to print direct to CD.I'm using BTC 1008 burner. suggest not buying if you use this drive.
1,Be advised,"I recently bought a 100 spindle of these things and thought they were a good batch till i tried watching my movies. My 2 burners (plextor, and NEC) burn them fine, but upon watching them regardless if its in my xbox or my 1000dollar yamaha universal dvd player, it gets half way through and starts studdering and goes unplayable. I attribute this problem to BAD MEDIA. stick with a decent brand."
1,Don't buy this item,I bought this DVD -R because of good price. I tried burning three DVD's all of them failed by saying some error message.I suggest not to buy.
1,Running 90% coasters so far.,"Powerbook G4 SuperDrive. They burn and verify just fine, but when I reinsert them tghey come up unreadable. I just burned the Solaris 10 Install DVD from an ISO image. Burned fine, verified fine, but when I try to install from it I get read errors. Same ISO, same burner, using a CompUSA private label DVD+R gives me a usable install DVD.Before a computer upgrade, I burned my iPhoto Library to one of these. It verified fine, then after I'd wiped my drive it came up upreadable. Lost a couple dozen photos, so I'm not as livid as I would be if this was my only backup. Still. That DVD will mount on a Windows machine; ISOBuster sees all three filesystems, but attempting to read anything gives me a CRC error.Do plenty of testing before you trust anything to these."
1,"Worst ""coaster"" rate of any brand I've tried","You get what you pay for ...I bought 2 packs of this media and only because the cost to return for replacement would be prohibitive and any potential replacement would likely be just as bad, I held onto them.Presently having about a 10% success rate on my burns with this brand, versus 75-80% with Ridata and TDK media.Even when I stepped recording speeds down to the lowest my drive will support, they failed with astounding predictability.When is a bargain not a bargain ... ?!!!"
2,Skippies!,"Amazon is out of my ridata / riteks so i got these to hold me over. No coasters so far, but the discs mess up in all 4 of our players. They stop and shake and skip and freeze now and then - all that good junk. Something to think about before you buy - the price is definately right, but the quality is questionable."
4,"Works good, but not at first!",My first try at burning to these disks returned an 'illegal disk' error using Nero and NEC DVD_RW ND-1300A drive. Nero showed the drive speed as either 1x or 2x. I upgraded my firmware on the DVD drive from 1.05 to 1.08 and tried again. The disk worked just fine and Nero now shows a speed of 2x and 4x. Sweet!
1,maybe not really 4x,"These may not be 4X. I bought them to go with a Sylvania DVD/VCR combo recorder, they were recommended by another reviewer as working well with the Sylvania (it requires 4X, can't use 8X). Although these were packaged as 4X, they did not work, and appear to be ingraved near the hub ring as ""8X""."
3,"Great inkjet receivable, bad for Onkyo","This media takes ink from the R200 dye-based inks quite well- colours are accurate (After profiling) and seem somewhat light fast.Unfortunately this media is completely unusable in my Onkyo DVD player. I've tried a good burn on different types- some get 1/2 way thru before problems crop up, but this Velocity media fails miserably.The code for this media is (DVDInfoPro)00000000 00 6C 00 00 01 40 C1 FD 9E D8 52 00 02 85 0D 10 .l...@....R.....00000010 88 9A 80 00 03 4F 50 54 4F 44 49 00 04 53 43 52 .....OPTODI..SCR00000020 30 30 38 00 05 88 80 00 00 00 02 00 06 09 0D 13 008.............Be warned: Priced attractively, but may not be suitable for your DVD player."
5,too funny,hahahahahahaha definetly adults only but he is so funny. I can only image being around this man for any lenght of time
4,Cheaper than going to his show,"I recently saw Ron White live and I was disappointed that almost all of the jokes he told were already on this dvd. I could of saved myself a lot of money by not going to see him in person. Overall, this dvd was ok. Definately NOT for children!"
3,Funny but Filthy,"I think if you are coming to this video from Ron's ""Blue Collar"" stuff, which many people would be, there is a good chance you will NOT appreciate this video. It's funny, but it is much more ""adult"" than anything you'd see with Blue Collar. This is not a ""family friendly video"" --most people would not be comfortable watching this video with grandma and the kids in the room.I'm not just referring to the language here either --there are a lot of very direct sex jokes in more detail than a lot of people would be comfortable with.Is it funny? Yeah, it's funny if you like that kind of humor. I found myself laughing quite a lot. But I wouldn't dream of putting it in the DVD player with my grandmother in the room."
4,Not his best but still good,"I love Ron White and while this DVD isnt his best, it's still good for a few laughs. A little new material, a little familiar material, and a few mistakes followed by improv that were probably the best part of the show."
2,not that good,during most of this show he is to drunk to be very funny i found only one funny skit on here
5,Another helpful use for scotch guard,"Again, I am looking forward to yet another entertaining evening with Ron White. He makes me laugh. Is there anything better than that??!! Keep them coming Ron."
1,"The ""Tater"" has been mashed.","I used to be a big fan of Ron White until I saw his latest video. He kept forgetting some of the jokes and his speech is getting more slurred. I think all those years of alcohol are catching up with him and his act just isn't as funny as it used to be. He told the same old, tired jokes and that can be a bit tiresome to some people. He said that this is probably going to be his last video because he wanted to spend more time on the road. I think it should be on the road to recovery."
1,Not Funny,"All this guy talks about is how much money he has. The only funny thing is that this guy got rich doing blue collar comedy and now he is totally not relatable and must be after a different target demo. He manages to fit into his act that he only flies private and has his own airplane, that he has multiple homes, that some Ritz Carlton hotel isn't good enough for him, and how he is a huge a-hole to people who valet his Range Rover. Complete 180 from the comedy that made this guy rich to begin with, where he talked about his a-hole brother in-law who coveted a mercedes with 3inch wiper blades. The guy has become the a-hole he got rich making fun of."
1,1 star because it won't accept negative numbers,"I honestly don't know why anyone would think this latest video from Ron White is funny. I really liked his previous release, and was looking forward to this DVD. I heard one funny joke in the entire set.His routine was loaded with so many F-Bombs, and other cursing that it detracted from everything he was saying. It is as if all he has to rely on now is profanity. Some profanity can be good, but Ron White jumped over the line of what is reasonable.Sorry Ron, but you are not funny when you are dropping F-bombs in every sentence.Save your money for something else."
1,Ron White behavioral problems,I am a FORMER fan. This DVD was NOT entertaining -- just plain filthy.I haven't even opened it -- I saw part of it on Comedy Central and was totally disappointed.
2,its not very good.,this manga is good for teens but not for kids.i was at the library when i picked this up i thought it would be fine because i read teen magnas all the time.But i get to the 10th page and they say (smart @$$)and later on they say(@#&^ this %&^* thing is chiped)and the only reason i gave it two stinkin stars is because its an ok fantasy.if u like that magna you should try ZATCH BELL my favorite magna.
4,Fear of Truth,"THis book will blow your religious ideals completely away. You will be left thinking if you read what you think you just read. An evil pall settles over a quiet neighboorhood, one which you will not want to step foot."
5,Much Underrated -A Backstage Classic,"The book is basically the shooting script for Kenneth Branagh's film (called A Midwinter's Tale in the US), with photos and an informative introduction by Branagh. The film is sadly underrated -It got very little attention here in the US. The writing is clever and funny, and the exploration (exposé?) of the world of the out-of-work actor is frighteningly accurate. Both the book and the film are increasingly hard to find. Snap them up -You'll be glad you did."
1,Freezes my computer,The drivers they provide for win2k are quite crash frequent. Just browsing the internet your computer will often crash. I have noticed less frequent lock ups using win 98 but they still hapen.
4,Having problems with online also,I have a small office networked with these cards. Works fine for printer and file sharing. Cannot get it to share online connection. What really has me puzzled though is the fact I had two of the computers at my house networked with the same cards and they could share the connection.
3,could be great...,"I have two computers networked using the PA301. It was simple to install the cards and run the software. We can easily share files and printers as long as we're not on-line. We cannot get it to work properly on-line. My goal was to use my computer as the primary one and have the other computer able to be on-line simultaneously and to be able to get phone calls while on-line. I am completely stumped on what I'm doing wrong with that part of the setup. I have contacted Netgear several times and found the person I spoke with (different each time) much less than helpful. They sounded like they didn't have any idea how the product worked. If I can get this one thing working, I'll be thrilled with it."
2,"boring, bad Italian music","I expected better, but of course, I was a mere child when I saw this movie and was swept away by Steve Reeves and Gordon Scott together....TarZan and Hercules....I probably didn't even here the music!"
3,It's So S0....,"This game is a decent game if you like the older style fighting games like Mortal Kombat II. The thing that really hurts this game is the control, Its very bad. The graphics however are very decent. Other things that I would have liked to see would have been a few bugs fixed with the names. The character Gogeta is called Vegetto and it is wrong. If ya wana waste your money on this game for just to collect it. Go ahead. The front cover has exellent grfx's. But Id suggest that you dont waste your money on this game unless your a true DBZ fan or a person who likes the old style of fighting"
4,This game is pretty good.,"This game came out a long time ago, but in a Japanese format. Five new characters come out if your man stay undefeated. There is a code that you can enter when the main title shows after the introduction--which, I may add, is the BEST introduction a game could ever have, the music and all--and then, that's when the game changes its title to ""Ultimate Battle 27."" There is a tournament mode, and you can challenge with a bunch of your friends, not like ""Budokai"" when only one character can be played."
2,Not unless your collecting,I would only recommend this game to collecters. There only five characters to unlock. The graphic are terrible even for Playstation one. There are only so many moves a character can do. I don't think it worth over $10
1,Very tragic indeed...,"I don't even know why I got this game in the first place. I mean, come on, Funamation knew this was a horrible attempt at a fighter video game. There's a good selection of characters, but the game is easy to win (simply stand far away and blast away with special energy attacks). Also, music and sounds are horrible. There was literally no voice translations, only title translations. For DBZ fans out there, go buy a PS2 and get Budokai 3. You'll be spending about $180 more than if you've bought UB22, but you'll surely be happy."
4,cool game!,this is a cool game!each guy you beat you get a level up! but to beat your charecter your level has to be level 100 and to unlock a charecter look in the instructuns in the back of the book.
2,"Wasn't any fun back in 1996, either.","I'm a huge Dragon Ball Z fan. I have been for about 10 years. That being said, this game is not any fun.If you are a Dragon Ball Z fan and have $20 to burn, you should still pick this up, though. The intro movies alone (the regular one and the one that shows up when you enter the code to unlock the 5 hidden characters) are worth the price of admission to a true fan.Sure, there are a lot of characters, but they're two dimensional characters in a 3D world (think Parappa the Rapper). The moves are basically the same for every character, and you just end up smashing buttons until somebody dies. There are no spectacular in-game visuals, either.It's nice to see a Japanese DBZ game brought out stateside (beside the NES Dragon Power and PSX Final Bout), but it's just too bad that most of them are barely worth playing."
4,?,wats so good about it. its not even 3D like final bout is and they got ssj on final bout. every time you fight u can become more of a ssj than not addbance in power.
2,Not a good buy,I tried this game because I really like DBZ but nearly everything about it is dodgy. The graphics are 2D like some gameboy game. The sound is terrible. You're in the middle of a fight and its playing all this soft touchy harmonal music. The voices are like a 3 year old girl screaming. The commentator for the world tournaments speaks in Japanese and when you select your character half of the names are wrong.Supreme Kai: KaioshinTien: Tenshin etc.Even in 2 player mode it is a bit dodgy because the combos take too long to do so your opponent can just bash you to death.
4,What A Great Game!,This game is cool. It has great sounds but the background doesnt go with the people. But i still say that its a good game but it gets very boring without a second player. If you dont have a PS2 and you like DBZ games you should get this game. :)If you want to contact me:AOL Instant Messenger: DragoonJetfireMSN Messenger: webmaster@gcsfn.tkYahoo Messenger: sunkenjetfire1
2,Dissapointing,"This game I thought would be a lot better than It was. First of all the game wouldn't even let me put in the code for an additional 5 characters that I was hoping for. The Graphics are okay but could use a lot of work, and the attacks are really hard to master. I would suggest renting this game before you want to buy it. The intros and the cover are about the coolest thing there is."
3,It's worth ten dollars!,"I don't not wan't make you fell bad about getting this, but it's not DBZ quality and lets not speak of GT. This was the last game I had before I sold my Psone. The game play is ok, but the graphics suck now I must remind you this game is old it's very old in Japand. Let me get to the point the energy blast suck they look like there shooting snot bughers. The characters look ok they fight pretty fast. look the point is it depends on how you think it is. I say rent it first if you dont like it or you do you decide. This game to me is just unsatisfing, but one thing I comend this for is the fighting is faster than on Dragonball Z budokai 1,2."
4,Great Game,"Let me put this straight, THIS GAME ROCKS! This game has great 2D graphics and has fun gameplay it may take a while to get an idea for the controls other than that it's great"
3,From a different time,"The author is clearly sexist and homophobic as he makes clear in his opening remarks. That said, the author provides valuable insight about answering a call to ministry."
2,"shade tree mechanic, do-it-yourselfer, vocational teacher",The book lacks wiring diagrams and comprehensive details on electrical matters. I have used many Chilton books since the 1970's. This book is too general in that Chilton tried to cover all models of most imported makes built in four years. I wasted my money on this one; it'll go to our community library. I have reviewed and will order the Chrysler manual for $82.00 as it will provide full information.
3,The twins mother is not dead,"In this book we find out who Ileana's father is and a lil bit more about the twins mother. Also, we find out who Aron's killer was and the whole truth about his death. This book was good but you can guess at some stuff so I just gave it 3 stars."
5,Is Thantos the real trouble?,"In this book one of the six pack has a problem, Breanna. Breanna's father messes up her b-day. Is ths why she has a secret? Eventually Bre will get help yet that causes more about the twin's life to be revaled because she meets someone with the exact same color eyes as them. Who is she? Next a trial at coventy island makes the twins guardian find out more about her life. Who truly killed Aron? Aron, Fredo, and Thantos's mothers spirit to tell the truth about who killed her son who she loved so."
2,"Pretty, but for how long?","They arrived missing some of the little glimmers... I have not even worn them yet and they continue to fall off. Pretty shoes, but if the glimmers keep falling off they don't exactly live up to their name...."
2,This is just the CD-based config manual in hard cover,"This book is just the IP section of Cisco's IOS documentation. Buying this stuff in frozen-state hardcover is probably a bad idea, as it will be outdated in no time. There are very few examples in this book, and virtually nothing about how things interrelate. You'd be much better off buying books with author's names on them (I notice that whenever a Cisco book lacks an author's name, it's usually a reprint of the CD documentation). I really wish Cisco would be up front about the source of the material (the Cisco CD) for these reprint titles. But nowhere do they mention how you can get the CURRENT version of this info (and for free to boot)."
3,A printed version of Cisco's online documentation,"I was a little disappointed with this book. I was expecting more on how the various protocols work, and how they should be configured. Instead it is essentially just a hardcopy of the Configuration Guides and the Command References available on the CD-ROM that comes with Cisco products, and also available on their website. It takes you through the steps required to configure a Cisco router, with a reference to the relevant commands, but does little to describe the fundamentals involved - why you are entering the commands it is describing. I have, however been much more impressed with some of the other Cisco Press books - 'Cisco CCIE Fundamentals: Network Design and Case Studies' being an excellent example."
3,"Starts well, but very repetitive.","This book contains some good information, but it is very repetitive and includes a lot of superfluous information. The back-and-forth style (the book intermixes standard textbook-like prose with mini-stories and sidebars through-out) also makes it difficult read in multiple sittings."
4,"Popular subject, easy to read.","Popular Psychology approach to a subject we find out about too late in life! Easy to read, and written for the average person."
2,Difficult to Read,"I'm about half-way through the book and I may not finish it. I find that that authors jump around an awful lot - there is no coherent ""plot"" and that makes it really difficult to absorb what it is that they are trying to say. I find the ""sidebars"" really annoying - they are not sidebars in the conventional sense, since they are in the middle of the page and not on the side, where they could be more easily ignored. So far, I have met Frank, John, Dave, Sam, Deborah, Todd and a couple of other characters and nothing hangs together very well. Quite frankly, I'm disappointed in the book and I wouldn't recommend it. I'm quite sure that Babiak and Hare have a lot of valuable information to share, but the way they've done it in this book just doesn't cut it. If I were a reader looking for more information on corporate psychopathy, I'd look for a different book."
1,A Disappointment,"I expected more of this book. Much of it was devoted to identifying whether certain characteristics of individuals whom you encounter at work, can properly be defined as psychopaths.Frankly, this is unimportant to the non-clinical person. The bigger question is what to do about such encounters, however the person is defined.The answer came late in the book, namely, kiss-up if such a person is your supervisor, and find another job as soon as possible. And don't fight them; they are very skillful, and you will lose.I did not need to read the book to know that this was the answer."
5,"new era-Dr. Ken Rabac, Phd-PsyD","Robert Hare has introduced a new era in our study of psychopaths by coauthoring a recent book dealing with these malevolent manipulators in daily life. Until this publication, Hare had regarded psychopaths mainly from a criminology perspective. In deference to Hare, recognized by consensus as the foremost authority on the disorder, books like Babiak's had to go out on a limb, or use the term sociopath. We are in a new era with Hare's expanded scope, and a new series of books like Babiak's can be expected. However, his will be regarded as a ""ground breaker"" and will set the tone for subsequent work. It is brilliantly conceived, written and realized."
2,A puzzler,"I find this book a puzzler; can't tell who it's aimed at. Not technical enough for psychologists; not enough practical advise for businesspeople; not entertaining enough for the casual reader. Snazzy title, dull and poorly organized text."
4,Great Book,"A great book. Really helped me through a difficult time in my life. If this book is read in conjunction with Morton Bain's Psychopath!, a degree of perspective and understanding is achieved that can really help deal with these very difficult people. I would recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone who has had this misfortune of dealing with psychopaths and dangerous narcissists,"
3,Suited and Booted,"There are some interesting ideas in this book - but they're suffocated by some of the dullest wet-blanket academic writing I've struggled through in years. It's one step forward, one step back as each idea is reiterated over and over, complete with fictional examples, real examples, possible examples and fast'n'furious caveats from each author. If you don't attempt reading the book at one sitting, you can be confused into thinking you've put the bookmark back in the wrong place - 'I'd swear I've read this already'. Well, you have but it was twenty pages ago; it's just come back again. Some sentences are so fact-free I began to suspect the intention of the authors was to induce psychopathy, not describe it.But the ideas behind the dense mat of dull verbage, they're interesting and relevant: they just deserve a better setting than this."
3,"Good information, bad delivery","I have read many psychology books and although I appreciate how the authors tried to make this concept available to all, it made enjoyment difficult.There is a lot of great research on this topic and it would have been interesting to have more of that instead of all of the anecdotes and stories the authors included. I just kept waiting for the good parts, which were few and far between."
2,Not What You'd Expect,"If you were seeking anecdotes and interesting real life accounts of psychopaths or psychopathic behavior in the workplace you'll be very disappointed. This reads as a psychology major's study guide to a niche - how to maybe-but-not-really identify the rare and elusive psychopath in the workplace. Boring technical analysis and VERY repetitive information flow.It contains an easter egg however: a useful guide for the hiring process in corporations, although other books that directly tackle that subject might do a more thorough job, and you wouldn't have to sift through pages of sand to find the gold."
3,"Interesting, but...","A book on an important and interesting topic, written by two great experts, well in particular Hare who seems to be the foremost authority in the world on psychopaths, but in a confused way, or at least it got me confused.I give it noneheless three stars because the content is important, and seems to be well made, unfortunately their style protected my brain from it.They interweave passages of fiction and didactic explanations, this great litterary trick did not help my memorization of the latter, when I turned the last page I had to admit it was a little bit of a mess in my mind about all the didactic and practical infos on psychopaths. I remember their stories well though!So much for the fluke of storytelling.Moreover, I found their description of the corporate world, even psychopath-free, rather depressing.Oh, and by the way: No, Christophe Rocancourt, the notorious Hollywood con man, is not revered as a national hero in France, I don't know where they picked that."
4,More people should read this book.,"This is an edifying work which sheds light on a workplace reality which many, while facing that reality, either do not fully appreciate or appreciate too slowly. Like others who have submitted reviews, I had previously read Without Conscience (which is an excellent introduction to the world of psychopathology for the layman). As I read through Snakes in Suits, there was clearly a considerable amount of repetitive information. While the book was initially disappointing in this regard, it was also necessary for the benefit of others who had not previously read Hare's Without Conscience.Overall, a worthwhile read that effectively presents an interesting topic in a manner that most can understand and appreciate. It should be mandatory reading for all professionals (HR, security managers, employment counsel, etc.) who deal with employment relations issues."
3,Good Holster,For the price this is a good holster. Will fit many mid to large sized pistols. Easily snaps on standard belt and is pretty slim profile for concealed csrry.
2,Hard to put on,"Fits my Glock 30 like a glove, But the snap on feature is very hard to apply to your belt with one hand. I wanted a easy on/off holster for my Glock 30, and the MX7 has bad reviews so I thought this would work. The snaps have to be lined under the belt, another snap over the belt and snap together, to hard to do while holster is loaded or unloaded. Back on the hunt I go!!!"
3,Felt sorry for her,"The book is about a young mother of six who has the '80s English consumerist mentality of not living within her means and when crunch-time comes decided the way out of her financial hole would be to turn to prostitution. She is lucky that the people she meets initially are sympathetic to her situation but then she graduates to doing 'it' once or twice a week to several times a night. In the process she is empowered to take on a lover, kick out her laid-back, non-contributing husband and continue with private education for the kids- towards the end, the nastier side and dangers of the job become apparent and at the end I felt quite sad for her body to get such a battering."
4,A sterling book about the Stirling bomber,"If there is anything wrong with this book, it is in the illustations, which I found a bit lacking at points, and which are all in black-and-white. This for a book in the same price-class as (or above) other standard references who do have colour sections. The overall style of the book is a bit of ""The complete book of Short Stirling Facts and Lists"", but all those lists are quite good information-wise. To sum it up: not an entertaining book for a cold evening by the fireside, but a very valuable reference."
5,Perfect for 6 year olds!,"I just purchased this for my 6 year old son and it was the hit of the party! It is perfect for imaginative play because of the realistice accessories. Wonderful, Wonderful, FANTASTIC!"
5,Good Game,"This game is preety good. It would probably be better if it was a Gameboy Color only game. You go through 15 levels using dive-bombing, dogfighting, and torpedo-bombing skills. You control the F6F in the third person view, so if you don't like to be in the cockpit of the plane, you might not like the game too much, though I liked it."
3,Think it should be better,"This game is ok. You must understand that this isn't like Playstation or 64. the graphics are o.k., but not great. You are in a view that is beside the plane. It is o.k. If you have kids that like planes, you might be able to find a better one but that is really just my opinion. If you do look for a differant one, may I suggest Top Gun. It is old but very good. Thank you."
2,IT WAS OKAY,I THINK THAT THIS MOVIE WAS OKAY. I KNOW THE PRODUCER OF THIS PROJECT. HE HAS DONE SOME OTHER GOOD MOVIES. PLUS MY BEEF WAS WITH THE FALSE COVER
2,It's bad!!,"The DVD box tells of one story and you get another. All this really started when a gold digger gripes to Smoke that Rob is the one with the power and Smokes takes it to heart and kills Rob. Smoke pins the crime on J-Boogie and gets Rob's brother to kill him. J-Boogie's Uncle find out and you pretty much figure out the story. There are other movies that do this same story, only better."
3,Useful information but ....,"Hillman presents a lot of useful information in a well-organized, straightforward and admirably evenhanded way. The book is short enough to be read in a single setting, and I found it genuinely helpful as the parent of a private school child who is vaguely considering boarding school as a future option. However, I find it disturbing that someone who is not only an alumnus but also a faculty member of presumably more than one elite boarding school could write a book with so many typographical, grammatical, spelling and punctuation errors. Both Hillman and his editor(s) should be embarrassed."
3,I hope his students write better....,"Unfortunately, the content of this book was so obscured by typos and editing errors that I could barely focus on Mr. Hillman's insights into boarding school life. One would think that a teacher, in particular, would keep a closer eye on the copy editor. Doesn't the author remember that old school maxim to ""check your work!"""
4,Interesting and easy to read,"I liked this book. I was hoping to find a ""rating"" system for the ""Ten Schools."" Instead I found useful guidance to the pros and cons of sending my son to boarding school. I just wish he would write (or provide) some secret rating system to the current schools. I read this book in one sitting, and it was definitely worth the money. I feel more confident about our family's choices after reading this book."
4,Oldie but goodie,"This book is over a decade old, ancient in the world of communications, globalization, and academia. Its chapters are not widely cited nowadays and some of its theorizing can feel weighted by age. However, some of its insights remain relevant in the examination of the everchanging landscape of communications, and communications studies. Some areas covered here have unfortunately not become larger areas of study, but are worth considering in the scope of the field."
5,Interesting,"I really liked this book, even though I felt guilty about it. Guilty because this guy is a major sinner. Throughout the entire novel, I couldn't decide if he was a good man who did bad things, or a bad man who did good things. Totally felt his loneliness, though, and the heart of a poet, albeit one who would slit your throat if he felt he had to.Wouldn't give it to my relatives to read but I would recommend it to people who think they hate the crime/spy/detective genre. This is written more as a work of literature than pulp fiction and I think it didn't get the attention it should have."
4,A Great Read,"I couldn't disagree more with any negative reviews. This was a marvelously crafted, cerebral thriller. Heartily recommended."
2,"Ideas: 10, close readings: 2","Once again Sedgwick provides a brilliant theoretical framework for thinking about contemporary queer identity issues, then trilalizes it by providing reductive and just-plain-unconvincing readings of a series of Western novels and novellas. Her reading of James's ""The Beast in the Jungle"" is a classic case in point--the idea of preterition as a point of slippage is brilliant, but her reading of the James novella is embarrassing.And she is one of the worst stylists in academia today."
1,Utter Tripe Masquerading as Scholarship,"Sedgwick reduces every piece of Literature to a ridiculous and illogical conclusion. She'd probably say this review was a ""masturbatory fanasty brought on by delusions of supremacy."" Sedgwick has some nuggets of insight but they are buried in horrendous prose and thought."
4,Aziz. Shihab,"I was attracted to look for out of print books by Aziz. Shihab. I was intrigued by the fact that he did a serious study of Carl Gustave Jung the german psychologist who coined the term ""synchronicity"" .. this book is much different than the focus on the lifetime work of Jung, but I am certain this guy is perhaps the greatest living modern mystical author."
4,Surprisingly good overview of MS Certifications,"A surprisingly informative update of the author's rather dismal ""MCSE Career Microsoft!"". More specific information has been added regarding the proliferating MS certification tracks (MCSE, MCDBA, MCP+I, etc.) The presentation is a little rosy (at least not blatant MS propaganda), but provides a decent, well organized overview of the certification process, what you can do with a certification, and some good recommendations for further resources. (Of course it does not reflect the September 1999 reorganization of the MCSE track for Windows 2000, and the announced retirement of the NT 4 track on 12/31/2000.) It's a good starting point for someone not familiar with IT certification in general or MS certification in particular, or weighing the option of starting on a certification, but it won't be nearly as useful to most persons futher on in the process."
2,I would rather watch paint dry...,"I finally broke down and bought this game because it was only 2.99 and I'm glad I didn't pay a penny more for it. It's mildy entertaining, at best, because there are very few fighting moves and other options. Also the action is very slow as opposed to other great fighting games like Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter. As in most games, I find the announcers annoying and time consuming, however the one good thing about it is the celebrity personalities. The idea of the game has great potential, but the makers have fallen short of my standards."
4,OK,THIS GAME IS VERY FUN BUT WHEN TOU DO THE EPISODE MODE ITS TO EASY AND ONLY SIX EPISODES !RENT FIRST!
4,Of greatest interest to Episcopalians.,"I enjoyed this book as a member of the Episcopal Congregation because I know the players or know of them. It sheds some light on church politics and clarifies why this presentment was directed at Righter rather than Bishop Spong. If you share the view point of Bishop Righter, you will enjoy sharing his fight through this rather well written book."
4,Entertaining,"This is second book by Thom that I have read, and it will not be the last. Decent writer, good stories, interesting characters."
3,Panther in the Sky,This is well written. It is excellent if you are that interested in the culture fo the Shawnee and resons behind their actions. I found it a bit too informative for just anenjoyable read.
3,James Thom,"This book I couldn't really get into but I sure liked Follow The River, in fact I read it some 20 years ago or so and several people in my family read it. We passed it along because of how much we liked it and all these years later I wanted my husband to read it and it took awhile to find because I couldn't remember the name of the book but I googled words like river and starving and Mary (I recalled her name) and it came up."
5,I found this book in high school..,"and was late for many a class because I was so engrossed that I failed to hear the bell go off! I was taken by suprise when I got to the end, I hadn't noticed how fast the pages went by.Loaded with historical facts but never gets the feel of a textbook, and gives us a vivid picture of the ""backstory"" of history, the little but important details that don't get into the textbooks."
3,Good book,"I liked the book. I did not find it as 'gripping' as some of the other Thom works, but it was still a good read. A little long and sometimes slow and repetitive, but worth reading."
2,Buyer Beware,"Just a quick Caveat for anyone considering buying this who already has the more common ""Keep On Moving"" CD:Each and every ""remix"" on here (with the possible exception of ""Sunshine Reggae"") is indeed simply the regular mix found on ""Keep On Moving."" The only benefits to buying this disc is 1) ""Let The Music Play"" 2) ""Sunshine Reggae"" and, arguably, 3) the bonus Videos disc."
5,Pearl Pendant,The Unicorn Japanese Akoya Cultured Pearl Pendant arrived ahead of schedule and was boxed very professionally and safely so that the product was in perfect condition. I'm very satisfied with the quality of the product and the presentation of the packing materials - I will definitely look to use this vendor again.
1,Very bad Diner Dash knockoff,"This game is a very poor version of Diner Dash. I actually made it past level 14 at one point, but my progress was not saved so I had to start over. Then the game kept cutting off at various points after level 14. Furthermore, if you try to pause the game, it does not pause and when you go back you have lost customers during the pause. And finally, like the other reviewers have said, there are no up grades, and the waitress is extremely slow, except for the few times you get to use a coffee boost. Bad, bad, bad!!!"
3,Coffee House Chaos is fun,"I liked this game--it paused for me and saved my game because I created a name for myself. The programmers also meant for this to be a ""thinking"" game and speed is not the entire way to get to the next level. Although it doesn't really have a lot of new features at each level, each level is played differently depending on how you beat that level. Just put on your thinking cap and try new ways, not just speed! It is fun."
1,poor story development,"Very, very disappointing. I actually was happy to finish.I would have preferred some character background as most true crime books extensively cover the character. This had NONE!Horrible, scattered writing. I was having to flip back pages to see who was who. Very disappointing, especially since I was truly intrigued by this story. Pass on this book..."
1,Dissapointment,"Honestly, I can't believe that I actually read up to 166 pages until frustration made me put it down. The author focused on some many details that had nothing to do with the story. I had to go back to the beginning to find out what the book was all about.The author seemed to have lost focus of what the story was all about. I found myself asking who are these other characters the author is writing about, and had so little information about the main characters. I'm an avid reader of true crime, but never have I encounter such a bad written book."
4,You Can't Make Up A Tale Like This,"""Out of Control"" relates a terrific story, the sort of bizarre true-life event that no fiction writer would ever DARE to suggest. In Houston, I first heard of Clara Harris on the local morning radio news report immediately after the incident in the hotel parking lot -- and the news person was, in an understandable struggle, fighting back laughter as she gave the account. Ann Richards, former governor of Texas, later made a delightful comment to the effect that gasoline prices are getting so high now that women in Texas have to carpool to run over their husbands."
3,Good Read,I was interested in the story when it first broke. I liked the book but hope someone comes up with a more in-depth book. The trial was a joke. Between her attorney and the judge she never had a chance.I read that she was up for parole recently but it was denied. I don't think she is a danger to the public. When I read about people who are released into the population who are psychopaths I think of her and wonder about the justice system. Its time for this woman to be released to her family.
4,Review of the Above Review,"Nina Antonia's book on Johnny Thunders is excellent, she had first hand access to him, he recognized her as his only biographer. Anyone who has to put her book down to recommend another one makes this book - Trash - seem highly suspect to me by association. You do no honor to the excellent memory of Arthur Kane either. No one took the time to write biographies of Johnny or the Dolls for years but Antonia, and your remarks are catty and embarrassing.Nevertheless, this book is recommended by all fans also with the warning that it contains inaccuracies, and lacks the emotion and affection for its subject that Nina Antonia's books have."
4,Good Place to start,"This book provides a good overall account of the story of The Dolls. Post Dolls-wise, there is more of an emphasis on Johnny Thunders later career than the other members, although their exploits are covered as well. My only complaint is that it did not have pre-Dolls photos. Reading about their pre-Dolls exploits made me wonder how they looked like during their mod-teenage years. Some early childhood photos would have been interesting as well. Otherwise, you can't go wrong with this account if you have never previously read a book about this legendary band."
3,I wish a Tosches or another real writer would do a Dolls book,"This book isn't terrible, and reads ok, but it is littered with factual errors and opinionated vernacular from the authors. It isn't really an improvement over the Nina Antonia books. While those may be viewed as amateurish, they make up for it with spirit and as another reviewer adeptly points out: actual first hand information. (and better pics)""Trash!"" is also very anglo-centric, and as a result I feel lacks an appropriate social context. This affects the Antonia books a bit as well. For 10 minutes or so, the Dolls WERE New York City. Can't a New York writer tackle this subject? In the same way Jon Savage was able to present the context of London and the Pistols in ""England's Dreaming""?If you are a fan, but this book and read it; you probably won't be disappointed. I just feel the Dolls impact and legacy deserve a more serious treatment."
4,Unhappy with vendor,"The book was a gift and the delay in receiving it m ade it awkward. I especially resented the 3 week envelope that the vendor gave me, without any personal support until I wrote a poor review."
5,Knowing God's Will for our lives - A Primer,I found this to be seminal book in my life. I had sruggled for years with the concept of understanding how God's will for my life could be understood and applied. This book set out the issues clearly and dealt with my questions in a simple and straight forward fashion. I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to know what God's will is for their life.
5,Why didn't anyone tell me about this before?,I am only to page 175 of this book and it is already impacting my life. Why didn't anyone tell me before that the idea that God has a specific individual for each person isn't even Biblical? This book has blown me out of the water. This is an excellent book for anyone who has EVER struggled to know and do the will of God.
5,The truth comes out-- what a relief!,"This book cuts through a lot of culturally developed [information] about the ""will of God"". It makes such a difference to have what scripture says-- not just a lot of cultural or traditional hot air-- on the subject.Friesen's straightforward, to the point writing is right on the mark, and is really quite liberating (it is for freedom He set us free...).Another wonderful book on the same subject is by Gerald Sittser, ""The Will of God as a Way of Life"" (what a wonderful title). Sittser has essentially the same perspective, but his book is less academic/apologetic in style, and is more like reading the great inspirational works of Philip Yancey or others."
3,Difficult to Swallow,"This book challenged a lot of what I have always believed in. He makes it sound as if God doesn't really care about our individual lives, and that there is no point to pray at all. I do agree with his point that we should not wait around for a ""sign"" from God to act on something. I don't agree however that God has no plan for our lives. I think we realize God's plan after it has already been done. It is impossible to see the future and guess at what God's plans are. But that does not mean that He has NO plan for each person's life, and the author of this book clearly believes He does not. I don't think that God is nearly as impersonal to Christians as the author makes Him out to be."
3,"Good thoughts, but swings the pendulum too far","This book is a must-read for anyone interested in seriously studying God's Will from a Biblical perspective, but the authors swing the proverbial pendulum too far away from the ""Traditional View"".Read this book with a critical mind and it will help you wrestle with the topic."
4,Amazon Service,The book was for a small group study and it is very good:) BUT the service from Amazon CONTINUES to be fabulous!
5,Decision Making Update,"The updated version of Decision Making and the Will of God is well worth the money. I hesitated to order the book wondering if it might just be a rehash of the original material, but I'm very grateful I ordered the book. Even though the book is similar to his previous book there is enough new material to make the book a worthwhile purchase."
3,Aspects helpful,"There were helpful aspects of this book such the determination of the different types of God's will.Where this book goes wrong is to suppose that their is very little in scripture that would be defined as the moral will of God. Friessen substitutes the vast wealth of information in the Bible that, friessen himself admits is the moral will of God, for what he calls ""wisdom."" The other questionable aspect of the book is the supposed sources of this wisdom he promotes. He suggests that certain charismatic gifts are still normative for today and as a result the sources are themselves equally vague. The result is the promotion of licentious behavior the second half suggests. For those looking for an ecumenical, anything goes view of the will of God this is your book. For those who seek a book that will expound the biblical position of the moral will of God it will only help in a small way."
2,What book did the other reviewers read?....,"I'm a doctor of chiropractic who has been interested in learning about alexander technique for some time. I'm on a budget so had to pick what I thought would be the best book (of many) on the subject to teach me the principles of this popular style. Unfortunately, this book was NOT the right pick. I suppose it would be interesting to someone who was curious about Alexander's thought processes which led him to the development of his method. But there is no practical information for a reader to apply the technique (whatever it is...?). Beyond a historical account of Alexander technique, this book offers zero value in my opinion. Disappointed."
2,Get any book on Alexander technique but this one,"Although he came up with the technique that bears his name, Mr. Alexander was not a gifted writer. There are many other books out there, some with full color pictures. I suggest pretty much any book but this one, especially if you are new to Alexander technique. This book will only leave you scratching your head."

1,Terrible!,"This dvd was so amateur! Can't believe they produced this for everyone!! She doesn't even transition , just jumped from one workout to another."
1,BORING!,"I have dozens of dvd workouts, and this is among the worst. I was expecting an exiciting workout from a ""rockstar"". She has no personality, and the moves are totally boring -- nothing original or fun. The production looks as if it were done by kids in middle school. Will donate to Goodwill -- not recommended."
1,unknowqn,"I do not have an idea on how to review this item as I HAVE YET TO RECIEVE IT!! I will certainly continue to use Amazon as it is very expediaent and available, however I will not do buisness with Awsomebooks again. Please se what you can do about this situation.Thank YouDoug Reimer"
2,"Too much video ""padding"" with generic scenery","I have been to Moscow and St. Petersburg many times and I know both cities very well. I have also been to several of the Golden Ring cities. I was looking forward to this video because I wanted to use it to encourage my friends to visit Russia. I was very disappointed in this video. Rather than fill up the video by showing the stunning, breathtaking interiors of the most important places, the director showed one or two interior shots of some palaces and churches and a few exterior shots. There are long stretches in this video with night time, moody scenic shots which show nothing and could have been shot anywhere. I would guesstimate that 35-40% of this video shows nothing of interest. This time could have been spent showing many of the interior rooms of these amazing places. I can not recommend this video and wish the producers would go back and redo it."
3,Disappointed,"The Virgin's Lover was recommended to me by a friend as a great historical fiction to take along on a beach vacation. Unfortunately, I found the book to be long, tedious to read and not all that interesting. At least I was reading at the beach!The characters lack depth and the story seems to go on and on without developing enough suspense to keep the reader engaged. It ends somewhat abruptly too. Eventually I finished the book, but came away disappointed.Readers are advised to keep looking for exciting historical fiction. There are so many books I have loved more than this one. If you haven't yet read The Red Tent, that's a book I highly recommend instead as an excellent example of compelling historical fiction."
3,OK Read,"I really enjoy reading historical fiction and it is my opinion that ""The Other Boelyn Girl"" was one of the best. In Philippa Gregory's follow-up, The Virgin's Lover"", I was not near as impressed. As usual, Philippa does an amazing job with her historical research and she does write well, however, I felt as though this particular story was very slow and drawn out. However, it did leave me to question whether or not there ever was or has been a King or Queen that embodied integrity or kind and gentle spirit? Surely, Elizabeth 1 did not."
2,I Had to Keep Checking this was not Harlequin Romance,"A story about Queen Elizabeth's early days on the throne. This version focuses on the romantic relationship she allegedly had with Sir Robert Dudley. He was a married man when she became Queen, but his lust for power drove him to try and manipulate her to grant him a divorce so that he could be King and fulfill a family destiny. We see the envy and hatred he inspired in others and the despair of his wife - both of which lead to his downfall.Although well-written and researched, the author makes Elizabeth into a flighty, lust-driven girl instead of what history has shown us to have been a very calculating and powerful Queen. the sections on Lady Amy Dudley are so whiny you almost hope she WILL die and release Robert - which is not what the author probably wanted."
4,Worth a read,"Not among my favorite of Philipa Gregory's novels. Although it is beautifully written and no doubt capitivating it seems to stray a little too far from historical fact. Queen Elizabeth is protrayed as more of a weak minded woman, easily swayed by the men of her council, especially Robert Dudley. I would have liked to have seen her portrayed more as the strong, independent leader that she no doubt was and less like a fairy tale princess unable to draw the line between her role as a monarch and her life as a woman."
4,smitten with Philippa Gregory,"I am absolutely addicted to Philippa Gregory's books, and this is a great one. I just discovered her about two months ago, and I am devouring her books because they are not only good reading, but she includes so much history that I really feel it's valuable reading. This book paints an even more vivid picture of Elizabeth. I couldn't put it down!"
4,A good work of FICTION,"""Fiction"" is the key word here. Gregory takes a few liberties with the story of Elizabeth I. For example, as Gregory tells it, Elizabeth meets young Lettice Knollys (also spelled Knowles) at court. Actually, in real life, Lettice and Elizabeth knew each other long before Elizabeth ascended to the throne. Lettice - along with Kat Ashley - was imprisoned with Elizabeth in the Tower while Queen Mary was alive.Other than a few inaccuracies here and there, this book was fun and easy to read. Gregory's prose is wonderfully appealing."
2,"Oh Liz, we hardly know ye","This book is too long! I grew weary of this Elizabeth and her co-dependent love relationship with Dudley. Such a simpering and sick romance. Where is the Elizabeth of courage, of strong will and true wit, of courage and character, of one who kept her head when many others lost theirs. She certainly is not in this book. although I enjoyed the setting, the background characters, the political intriques, the plotting and re-plotting, I did not enjoy the main event. Too much of the book was romance; I wanted a historical novel with fresh and exciting insights on Elizabeth and her times. Gregory has a great writing style and can tell a good story. I did finish the book because there was sufficient background interest. But I hope to find a meatier main event in Gregory's next novel."
2,Queen Elizabeth Fans Beware,"While I have enjoyed several of Gregory's other works, including The Constant Princess, The Queen's Fool, and The Other Boleyn Girl, I couldn't even make it through this book. I am an avid reader of historical fiction and non-fiction and never have I been so disgusted with a portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I. Gregory writes about an immature, one-dimensional girl unable to make the simplest decisions without her lover, more focused on lust and adolescent games than running a country. Despite the fact that Queen Elizabeth I was fluent in English, Latin, Greek and had studied War, Science, Mathematics and was a model pupil throughout her schooling, Gregory expects you to view the Virgin Queen as little more than a village idiot who has the crown thrust upon her. While Gregory's works are on the whole fulfilling this left me completely dissatisfied and unimpressed with her writing."
5,Could not put it down....,"I had this book sitting on the shelf for awhile. I was in no hurry to read it as I did not think it would be as good as the other books I have read by Philippa Gregory. I love this book. It has turned out to be my favorite one yet. It is hard for me to put this book down. I want to keep reading ,but I do not want it to end. This is a definite must have from this talented author."
2,Disappointing,"I have read and enjoyed others of Philippa Gregory's novels, but was disappointed by ""The Virgin's Lover"". It was repetitious, and the characters were ultimately boring in their depiction. This is one of my favourite periods for historical fiction, and I have read dozens of novels set in the period. So it isn't the facts/the plot that matter as I read; it is how the story is told.""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is excellent, and ""The Constant Princess"" and ""The Boleyn Inheritance"" are good reads."
2,Gregory has done better,"I couldn't tell you who this book was about, but it certainly wasn't Elizabeth I. Portrayed by Gregory as a dependent almost stupid neurotic, this estimation of her character flies in the face of all accepted scholarship. And the writing isn't so hot, either. If I had to read one more time that Elizabeth was picking her cuticles, I would have gone mad. The Other Boleyn Girl is a much better effort."
3,Not As Compelling As Some Others,"After thoroughly enjoying ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and ""The Queen's Fool"" I was looking forward to reading the next installment in this series. I was disappointed. In ""The Queen's Fool,"" Elizabeth and Robert Dudley are flawed yet still likeable characters. I did not like them at all this time, plus I had been hoping that the story of Hannah and Daniel would continue on.I am glad that I waited and borrowed this book from the library rather than rushing out to buy it in the hardcover edition.For a much better read, try ""I, Elizabeth"" by Rosalind Miles."
2,Worst fictionalized account of Elizabeth I have read,"I was sorely disappointed in this book, having heard from several people how good it was. Unlike most of the nonfiction work I have read, Queen Elizabeth is made out in this story to be an indecisive romantic simpleton who had to be lead to every important decision she made by the men surrounding her. Instead of masterfully playing the field to keep alliances as most historians feel she did, she is portrayed as whining and indecisive about her lovelife as well, controlled totally by Robert Dudley and William Cecil. I found this book almost insulting in it's lack of strong feminine characters - and here is one of the strongest, most heroic female characters of her age. If you are looking for a hot romance book - this is it. If you want a good piece of historical fiction about Queen Elizabeth I then read Alison Weir."
1,OUCH!,"I am only about 3/4th into the book, and boy am I glad I didn't actually pay anything for it! I can't believe that Ms Gregory portrayed Elizabeth this way... I am going to keep reading because I want to at least get to the part when Amy Robsart falls down the stairs and see how the author handles that ... I am really surprised that a female author would portray all her women characters this way, including even Elizabeth. It sounds like a mysogenist wrote this book - the female characters are all so unlikable and even pathetic! It's really too bad because Philippa Gregory is a popular author (although for the life of me I really can't figure out why) and many people think that her stories are historically accurate...."
1,Mediocre and disappointing,"I loved The Queen's Fool, and The Other Boleyn Girl, but this book was a disappointment. Gregory's Elizabeth is week and lovesick, her Robert Dudley is self seeking and manipulative, and her Amy Dudly is annoying. Basically, all the characters are unsympathetic. I'm shocked by this since all the characters in her other books are complex and interesting.For a better Elizabeth I and Dudley love story, check out ""I, Elizabeth"" by Rosalind Miles."
4,It is fiction after all,"Yes, the author took some liberties with the accepted ideals of Elizabeth's and Dudley's characters, but in doing so she created a much more believable story. Ms. Gregory weaved together historical fact along with speculation, and the outcome is purely entertaining.If you're interested in finding out more about Elizabeth, and want facts only, try Jean Plaidy's ""Queen of this realm"" and Allison Weir's ""The Life of Elizabeth I"". Otherwise, read this book with an open mind, and remeber that is is historical 'Fiction' after all."
5,Great Book!,"I am a great lover of Elizabethan anything and when I found this book I was overjoyed! It seemed very realistic and I loved that it was from Amy Dudley's viewpoint, a person we don't really know much about. If you're reading P. Gregory for the first time be prepared to love her work and just know that you can't read just one...wonderful author, wonderful book!"
1,wanted to buy until I saw the price!!!! Will find another book.,"The book sounds wonderful and gregory always comes through. Was looking for a historical fast and chose this one, untilI saw the price. Oh well, S&S;'s loss. I will find a book priced for me."
2,Summary on Back Ruins Book!,"Taken from the back cover of the paper back: As the young couple falls in love, a question hangs in the air: can he really set aside his wife and marry the queen? When Amy is found dead, Elizabeth and Dudley are suddenly plunged into a struggle for survival.Nice summary, however, Amy Dudley doesn't die until page 410 (of 438). You will read 94% of the book with Amy alive, knowing that she will die. Whoever wrote the summary on the back is an idiot because it definitely ruined the book for me. I would have read it completely different if I had not known Amy would die - and that fact could have been an actual surprise. I also would not have been waiting for it for 410 pages!Overall a good book, I just feel like I wasted my time."
3,"If you have read Gregory previously, you'll be disappointed","Being a big fan of the author, I expected more. As usual,the author did a great deal of research. However, the story just doesn't compare with some of her other novels. The Other Bolyen Girl was one of her best. If you want to read a great piece of historical fiction, choose it, and skip this one."
4,Tudor Historical Fiction,"This is #5 in the Tudor Court series. It takes place starting in 1558 with the crowning of Queen Elizabeth I of England, daughter of Henry VIII and his second wife Anne Boleyn. She has scandalized England by her associations with Earl Robert Dudley, who is still married to Amy Dudley. They are a mismatched pair, yet you do feel sorry for Amy. The story is told with Gregory's consistent skill."
4,The Virgins lover is great,Philippa Gregory does it again with this book. Great detail and nothing dull in this historical novel. Well worth reading!
2,Not Her Best,"I usually love Philipa Gregory books, but this one I am struggling to get through. With her other Tudor series books, it seemed that I would finish them in a matter of days. This one has taken me much longer to finish - mostly because I just don't care about the characters. It's fine to take liberties with history and paint Elizabeth as a younger, less confident queen at the beginning of her reign, but please give her some redeeming quality for me, as a reader, to care about! I ended up going to Wikipedia just to find out what actually happened to the characters because I couldn't wait any longer for this long, plodding book to tell me. Honestly, I found the Wikipedia account more interesting. I just don't understand how you can fill hundreds of pages with text and still have a story that doesn't go anywhere."
2,Disappointing!,"I hate to say this, but I did NOT like this book. I suppose it's a must read if one is interested in following the whole Boleyn story, but this book is not as good as the other works of Gregory's I have read. I wouldn't call it a waste of time, but it's taken me forever to get through a simple 400 page book. I kept trying to chalk it off to the story itself not being as riveting as the other books, but for whatever reason, I didn't like it.The only thing I liked was when Gregory flipped from the passion of Elizabeth and Lord Dudley to the dismal life of the cheated on wife, Amy, in some kind of parallel universe.I'd recommend this book only for those who wish for the continuity of the Boleyn saga. But then, so many books, so little time......"
3,Not as good as some of her others.,"I was a little disappointed. Primarily it's because I didn't like her portrait of Elizabeth. However accurate or inaccurate it may have been. Elizabeth is one of my heroes, but in this book she is whiny, capricious, indecisive, foolish..... I didn't like her at all. Allison Weir's portrait of the young Elizabeth in ""The Lady Elizabeth"" is more likeable, and yet apparently is still a version of Elizabeth that is grounded in the historical facts that are known.However the mystery surrounding Amy Rosbarth was very interesting. This is worth reading if you are a Gregory fan or a Tudor history fan."
3,"Read the book, don't listen","I had enjoyed a Phillipa Gregory book set in World War II, so I picked up this book on CD to listen to in the car, without having read her other books. I assume I was supposed to sympathize with Amy Dudley, but I found her to be such an annoying, wimpy nag I fast-forwarded through many of her exceedingly repetitious speeches. With a print page it's much easier to skip. I found myself rooting for William Cecil, the only one who seemed to have any sense. Entertaining, but flawed. Makes me want to look further into the matter."
3,This Author has so much more to offer,"If you are a first time Gregory reader, this is not the best she has to offer. I found ""The Other Boleyn girl"" to be absolutely fascinating and impossible to put down. I am a slow reader and finished that one in record time. This book, although entertaining, lacks some of the qualities that made Boleyn sooo good. In Boleyn, Gregory takes a subject matter that most of us thought we knew about and turned it on it's head. She illustrated the royal court to be a dangerous place, full of scheming and coniving people, that I had never imagined before. It was like a good piece of juicy and shocking gossip. Although there is plenty of scheming in The Virgin's Lover, it is not nearly as entertaining and fresh. If you have read and loved The Other Boleyn girl, The Virgin's Lover may come up short if you are expecting to find more of the same eye-opening story telling. If you haven't read any of the books in this series, go for The Other Boleyn Girl first."
3,Not Bad,"I was very excited when this book came out, as I had just finished reading Philippa Gregory's two previous Tudor-era novels. Alas, I found the book much harder to get into and I found no character genuinely likeable. By the end, I pitied some characters and loathed some characters, but none really stuck out as ""wow! what a remarkable character!"" I prefered ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" much more to this one. One I got more into the swing of the story, it was much easier to read and the history about Elizabeth's I first few years of her reign was compelling. This book was good, but definitely not amazing."
2,I got through it....,"This book was not horrible. (When a review starts out with that it is not a good sign) I found it to be sided against Elizabeth or at least I found it to contradict a lot of what I have previously heard about Elizabeth. This book represented her as a woman completely dependant on men. Overall, I found myself mostly bored, but half interested in what was going on. I felt like there was way too much back story for what the book was supposed to be about (Amy Dudley's murder). By the time the climax happens the book is almost over and I found I liked the ending mostly because I was happy to finally be finished. I did learn some interesting things from this book, but overall I would have to say that I do not recommend it. I was hoping for more, but this book did not deliver."
2,Not for feminists!,"This reworking of the story of Elizabeth I and her relationship with Robert Dudley will be thoroughly enjoyed by those looking for an Aga saga, but if you want true history, leave it alone. Gregory's portrayal of the young Elizabeth paralysed by lust and unable to make a decision without a man at her side will cause feminists (or even just capable women!) to throw the book at the nearest wall. This is a woman who is acknowledged to be one of the greatest monarchs, male or female, that England has ever had, yet Gregory has reduced her to a lovesick fool. The portrayal of Cecil the schemer is the most accurate characterisation in the book; for the rest, if you want to know what really happened, stick to David Starkey."
4,Excellent Historical Fiction,I've become addicted to historical fiction thanks to Philipa Gregory. Her stories are well written and the characters are so vibrant. Her knowledge of history makes the story feel very plausible.
3,Tired,"I started with the Other Boylen Girl and loved it. Lots or drama, twist, and suspense but the other two books have been predictable and almost boring (The Queen's Fool and the Virgin's Lover). I did buy the Boylen Inheritance and hope that it is much better. As one reader to another, skip these two books. History is great but the story in between lacks."
3,Love English history,"Definitely better than THE QUEEN'S FOOL, but nowhere close to THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL. An enjoyable read, but could have been cut down by a hundred pages or so. People who saw me reading this book were easily put off by the title, thinking it a cheap Harlequin romance (which at times it resembled). I can't believe that a Queen as heralded as Elizabeth I could have been so weak, immature and indecisive as she is portrayed here. And Robert Dudley...what a conniving, manipulative, power-hungry, heartless, chauvinistic pig (I could go on all day)! I appreciated the way William Cecil's evenheaded, intelligent and respectful character balanced out the story (thank goodness he was included).Overall, an enjoyable read. By the way, if you reading this book because of an interest in the Amy Robsart death mystery, the whole climaxing event doesn't happen until the last 20 pages or so (although her character plays a role throughout the entire book)!"
3,A very flawed Elizabeth!,"Although this book was well written, I was distracted from the story by the portrayal of Elizabeth Tudor as a clingy, indecisive female who was being fed lines and ideas William Cecil, and sexually enslaved by Robert Dudley. Historical accounts of Elizabeth I stress her intelligence, independence and strength. True, she was also unpredictable, prone to occasional hysteria and often ill--but the portrayal of her in this book left me cold. Elizabeth would have known very well how to behave at a royal court, since she spent much time there as a child and teen. She was also incredibly educated and possessed almost uncanny instincts where people were concerned. The portrayal of poor Amy Dudley was possibly close to the truth, and the role of women in Tudor society could indeed be a very tragic one. But the real Elizabeth Tudor was most probably quite different from the fragile puppet portrayed here."
3,Nothing special,"I loved Gregory's other two recent novels, ""The Other Boylen Girl"" and ""The Queen's Fool"", but was extremely dissapointed with ""The Virgin's Lover"".While it wasn't terribly written it got rather boring and repetitive halfway through. Sure there were some racy parts, but it was altogether really unexciting.It was interesting to learn more about the life of Robert Dudley (though we learned a lot in ""Queen's Fool""), and nice to read about Elizabeth's early years as queen, but this was more sensational than historical, and even as sensational it still wasn't very entertaining like Gregory's other novels.I was also dissapointed that this was only available in hardcover, and thus more expensive than the other two novels. I was excited for this book to come out, but now I just feel like I wasted my money.Save your money and your time, at least until it's on sale or in paperback."
3,"Good read, well researched","A good read, would give three and a half stars...not as good as ""The Other Boleyn"" though, which I thought was amazing."
2,My least favorite of the series........,"I wanted to finish the series, so I forced myself to finish this one. The good news is there is a twist at the end. The bad news is, it's pretty slow before that. I'm guessing Philippa was trying to cover the whole era, and this part is a yawner. There is really only 2 main characters, with three minor characters. Without all the twist and turns of her other books with a large cast of characters, there isn't much intrigue here. In Philippa's other books, I've become attached to at least one character, and can't wait to find out what happens to them. I didn't have any favorites here. I got lost in discussions about French, Scottish and English alliances--it turned into a history lesson. You could probably skip this one without losing your place in the series."
3,Good Read but Questionable,"I find Ms. Gregory's fiction enjoyable and very readable. However, I find it a little disconcerting that one can see at a glance just what her view is on Queen Elizabeth I - she just does not have a good opinion of this queen and has made someone who changed the shape of the world into an almost manic sex-crazy flirt. Yes, documented facts say that Elizabeth was a flirt and she certainly had tons of scandal to live down over her behavior with Robert Dudley (at the time, Mary Queen of Scots was a saint in comparison). But her characterization in this book was totally unbelievable. To believe that she was so sex-crazy that she couldn't do a think without a morning visit from Dudley is stretching the imagination. Clearly, Ms. Gregory is on Catherine of Aragon and Bloody Mary's side, and is against Anne Boleyn and her daughter."
2,not there,"I loved ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and ""The Queen's Fool"" finding them, actually two of the most wonderful, fascinating, gripping books I've ever read. The best! Then went to the early trilogy and was so disgusted I threw them in the garbage. Now there's ""The Virgin's Lover."" I paid lots of money to buy this in hardcover, expecting to be transported, and I'm on page 53 and still plugging away, trying to get into it. Seems likely I'll chuck it. It just doesn't flow like TQF and TOBG, feels ""made-up"" and stilted where those came totally to life. When I read TQF and TOBG I thought they were the result of an artist finally coming into her own, so complete they felt almost channeled. This, on the other hand, seems more like someone trying to cobble something together, forcing it rather than feeling it."
2,Not the standard we have come to expect from Ms.Gregory,"I could not put The Other Boleyn Girl down, it was a real page turner, history mixed with romance and intrigue, even though we knew the outcome. It was so fascinating that I went out and read everything there was to know about Henry VIII. However, Ms. Gregory seems to have run out of steam, if not subject matter. I could hardly bring myself to pick up this dreary book. Elizabeth is portrayed as weak and unlikeable,(infact there are no likeable characters in this novel), and not the queen we know her to be. The constant description of her long flowing red hair and black eyes and Dudley's smoldering good looks was unbearable. It reads like a cheap romance novel with a slice of English history thrown in for good measure. Ms. Gregory should choose herself another English monarch, I have read her three books about the Tudors, enough is enough!"
1,Disturbingly biased,"I have read all of Ms. Gregory's books. This one was a shock to my sense of expectation from this normally breathtaking author.Her portrayal of Elizabeth I was rediculously biased and slanted. It was much closer to reading a trashy romance novel than a 'fictional',historical portrayal of a woman such as Elizabeth I.Ms. Gregory did all she could to give readers the sense that Elizabeth was nothing more than a manipulative, weak, immoral and oversexed vixen. I was disappointed in such a depiction. As a successful woman herself, Ms. Gregory was off her game to deliberately portray Elizabeth in such a manner. Perhaps the author's depiction of catty Elizabeth is instead a self portrait? This book would not be suitable enough to be used as kindling in my fireplace."
2,A Disappointing Read,"I am quite distressed about the portrayal of Queen Elizabeth the First in this novel. Yes, she is a fallable human being like the rest of us. But as an amateur British historian, I cannot believe that she could have been nearly as shallow and self centered as this book shows her to be. Every history I have ever read regarding her reign portrayed her to be a remarkable, strong woman, whose dedication to her country and it's best interests was always paramount. I found I had to force myself to finish the book.However, I was intrigued by the theory of the true nature of Lady Dudley's demise. It seems plausable and and worthy of the statecraft of William Cecil."
2,Lacking Luster,"I have read The Other Boleyn Girl and The Queen's Fool and loved both of those novels. However, this novel just did not impress me at all. There was no likeable character throughout the whole book. They took Queen Elizabeth, who is usually considered one of the greatest ruler's of England and turned her into an insecure whinny girl. Robert and Amy Dudley's characters were very stagnant. Robert seemed focused on being the King the entire time and Amy was just sad and crazed half the time. The books is really boring all it talks about is who Elizabeth is flirting with or how she does or does not want to invade Scotland. Save your money and your time and read her other books."
3,adequate,"Philippa has a habit of not doing her homework or changing facts to make her stories more interesting. Her books are an entertaining way to start your journey into medieval England but when you're really hooked, move on to Alison Weir and Sharon Kay Penman."
2,My Least Favorite of Gregory's Books,"I've been reading many Philippa Gregory books lately. This one is my least favorite and it's taken me 6 weeks to finally get through it (took 2 days to finish ""The Queen's Fool""). Redundant, wordy, and no heart in it whatsoever. I felt disconnected from the the plot and the characterss. Disappointing."
5,One of her best!,"Philippa Gregory's books are all amazing. But among the best I think are The Boleyn Inheritance, The Other Boleyn Girl, The Queen's Fool, Wise Woman, and The Virgin's Lover. And Virgin Earth! I love them all...if you are considering reading one of Gregory's books, you won't be disappointed. I was hesitant with buying a few of her books after reading some of the reviews on here, but I have read most of her novels (still working on the 18th and 19th centuries) and I was NEVER disappointed."
5,read in chronoligcal order,"This is a great series, but you sometimes get lost in who is who and when did it happen. My suggestion is to read them in this order and not the order that Ms Gregory wrote them. Then you would have a better understanding of the events of history: The Constant Princess; The Other Boleyn Girl; The Boleyn Inheritance; The Queen's Fool; The Virgin's Lover. I am awaiting the final one in this series and it is The Other Queen."
3,"The weak side of Elizabeth, not a full view","Elizabeth I may be the greatest most interesting ruler ever and I love Philippa Gregory, so what happened here? I know Elizabeth relied heavily on Robert Dudley but this book ONLY focused on the vigins ""lover"" so the other more compelling strengths of Elizabeth are just not mentioned. This book provides a distorted, narrow view of Elizabeth. I have learned more about Elizabeth I's strengths through other books and also the HBO movie ""Elizabeth I"" with Helen Mirren which was excellent. I suggest other sources for Elizabeth stories - keep looking."
2,Reads like a Harlequin Romance,"I first read 'The Other Boleyn Girl' and was enthralled from cover to cover. However, this book is juvenile and romantic fluff in comparison. I will try again with this author but do not recommend this book."
2,Just plain unlikeable,"I've read several of Phillipa Gregory's books, inlcuding the Constant Princess and the Other Boleyn Girl. I thought this book was a giant disappointment. It lacks the pace of the others and as another reader remarked, it doesn't have a single likeable character. Ms. Gregory focuses a lot on telling readers what a stud Dudley is and what a conniving, weak and ignorant girl Elizabeth is. Also, poor Amy Dudley...what a sad woman. But not enough backstory to really understand her. The closest to sympathy I had for any character was Cecil who was oiften so fed up with Dudley and Elizabeth that he wished he could escape them all. Me too, Cecil, me too."
3,"Not the worst, but not the best","I don't know if the writing was just really good, or if I just felt sorry for Amy Dudely, but I can honestly say that by the end of the book, I thoroughly hated Robert Dudely. Queen Elizabeth is written to be a weak lovesick woman, which I'm not sure if I agree with, and the book takes about 100 pages or so to get interesting. There's a brief cameo of Hannah Verde (Green) from the preceding book ""The Queen's Fool"" and Catherine Knolly (Mary Boleyn's Daughter) also has a cameo in this book. Overall, I give the book 3 stars, not my favorite by Gregory, but not the worst either."
4,Great perspective,I really enjoyed this quick read. Philippa manages to tell her stories from such an interesting perspective. Very creative and thoughtful. She weaves pieces of history into this fictional story. Highly recommended.
3,Rather biased,"I enjoy Philippa Gregory usually...but this was a little too biased against Elizabeth and possibly historically inaccurate to be palatable. I found Alison Weir's Elizabeth, the Queen to be far more objective and dealing with both the good and the bad without deifying or demonizing (as in this book) Elizabeth. But three stars for creating the historical atmosphere."
4,Great Read!,I have read several of Philippa Gregory's books and this is one of my favorites (the first one being The Other Boleyn Girl). It continues with the same themes of love and greed that appears in the other books but they are presented from the perspective of a man. Which make is quite interesting because all her books are usually written from a females perspective.
2,Disappointing,"I loved the first two books in this series but this one was extremely weak. The characters were not likable and it was very slow from beginning to end. There was very little history from the era and not a lot of ""plot"" or intrigue. I would pass on this altogether."
3,Robotic Kitty a little mechanical,"This robotic kitty sounds good and does some neat things, like hold a fish to his mouth and talk to you via his eyes to let you know if he's hungry, etc., but he hasn't gotten played with much. I think for my 6 year old daughter, it just isn't cute or cuddly enough to make you ""believe"" it's anything more than hard plastic. She abandoned it quickly in favor of other cuddly toys even though this was on her Christmas Must Have list."
1,Katie Pham,They don't work very well and nothing exciting at all. My kids played with it for only 5 minutes and totall bored.
2,Not as snuggly as you might like,"My kids (2, 6, 8, 10, 17) found this kitty to be entertaining, but only for a little while. The pieces seem to break off easily, thus dulling the fun for this not-so-cuddly kitty. Since last Christmas, it has only been played with a minimal amount of times. Not really worth the time."
2,a failure,This game is the worst baseball game out there. The controls are weird because if by mistake you're facing 2nd when you want to throw to third you throw it to second and this is very frustrating. The swings are really stupid too. It looks like your hitter did a half swing that turned into a homerun. There for I think backyard is a failure. This is a game for kids 6 and under. This is also a complete waste for baseball fans. So if you are a baseball fan I reccomend MVP baseball 2004.P.S. Don't even think of renting it.
2,Expected much more.,"The other reviewers were right on the money except for the ""plant"" who gave it 5 stars. The only reason I bought this DVD was because Nikki Fritz is in it and it's getting harder & harder to find any of the movies she was in. Would have been great to see more of her and she is the only reason this movie gets 2 stars from me."
2,Not like the box said,"Two star body doing two star strip. Killings. Kidnappings. Lots of walking in the brush. Kidnapper tells 2nd lady with nice body he needs someone to help him spend his money. Then around a campfire he suggests everyone sing and the 2nd lady spends 15 seconds turning around and uncovering her breasts. They walk into the bushes and simulate sex, again showing her breasts. This could have been at least a four star if they had done in the movie what they advertised. They were supposed to do strip dancing every nite, not just once. Heavy sigh."
1,Left out the good stuf,"Advertises two women kidnapped in the woods and have to strip dance more and more revealing to stay alive. In reality you see a lot of walking thru the woods, but only one scene where a good looking girl shakes her skirt, and kidnapper takes her into the bushes, but no action. There were no increasing revealing strips. And the actress?! Ford could have been left out of the movie."

3,Classic Midtown Action,"Ok, to be perfectly honest with you, Manhattan by Neal Travis is about character development through New York City. It's showered with famous Midtown places of the 70s such as 21, Elaine's, Studio 54, and Costello's. The plot is a long developing story about Michael Glennon trying to save the magazine Manhattan from being bought out by a board member. This ultimately takes on many exciting adventures to different places. Travis leads the reader through the powerful-closed doors of the chic in NYC. With an outcome to be determined! A good buy, if you like to read about the NYC life or you just like to be entertained."
5,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!","Whenever I play this during a dinner party or something, people always ask ""Who is this? This is GREAT!"" Delightful, good-humored, enjoyable, and just what the doctor ordered."
1,Lightweight,The weight of the paper is near onion-skin. I cannot imagine it being able to withstand steady use.
2,Telephone Numbers,"There is not a great deal of room to put telephone, work and cell #s. It is made of a plastic that I am sure will be tearing sooner than later and the tabs are not easy to get to the letter you want. You really get what you pay for... Go for the more expensive leather version.. You will save money in the long run"
1,Not what it says!,"I didn't even buy this to know that it wasn't what it says it is! It says single letter tabs, but the picture clearly shows ""AB"" ""CD"" ""EF"" are grouped together. I don't want to have addresses for ""Anderson, Brown, Byrnes, Allen"" etc all on the same page. I want a single tab for each letter! I wrote to the At-A-Glance company about it, but never heard back, figures!"
3,kinda flimsy,"It's a bit flimsy but okay, a few extra pages would have been nice but it'll work. A place for email addresses would have been a plus but if you write small, you can squeeze them in."
3,Really Disappointed,"This camera was great until just like the others - the dial broke while I was on vacation. Camera shops refer you to the Toshiba website. The Toshiba website is useless. Unfortunately, I never came across these reviews while I was researching digital cameras. Don't buy this one!"
3,"Works Great, Until it Breaks","I have had this camera 3 months, and I loved it, I really did. Then, just like others have noted, the top dial fell off where you take the pictures from. I have tried EVERYTHING to fix it- the Toshiba websites are not helpful and every store I enter tells me they are not Toshiba dealers. I think I may have to just give in and purchase another one. I am very disappointed in this brand."
1,Defective Design. Will Not buy a Toshiba again,"I bought this because it was cheap & had many features. However, it was only after the camera's warranty expired that I found out that it was a waste of money & that Toshiba is the most customer unfriendly electronics company out there. I only used the camera maybe a dozen times in a year, however like many have complained, the mode selection knob just came off in my hand while turning it on (while trying to take pictures while on vacation). Toshiba's website is unhelpful & Toshiba is unresponsive. I tried local camera shops, but no one repairs them."
3,"Great product, when it has the dial","This camera has been great until this past week. The dial broke off, so now I can't use it. I've read other places that this is a common problem. So if you like Toshiba, you might want to look at one of their newer models."
2,"Great photos, but faulty mode dial",The quality of the photos is great on the highest resolution setting. Zoomed in the photos are not as clear. After 2 years the mode dial popped off and I'm now looking for a new camera. Cost to repair is $[money].
3,Questionable Value,"The picture is misleading. The kit did not include as many pieces of glass as pictured; and they were very small pieces. We also did not recieve a flux pen, as listed. The solder & copper foil were not full spools, as pictured, just pieces. Although the videos were good, I question whether the rest of the items were worth the price we paid - I think we could have assembled our own ""kit"" items for the same or less money."
2,"Thin content - EJB 1.1 only, no EJB 2.0","Unlike the Weblogic workbook by Nyberg, which has excellent EJB 2.0 exercises, this one only covers EJB 1.1 stuff, perhaps because the Websphere is slow in supporting EJB 2.0 ? It claims not to cover 2.0, but still rather dissapointing."
2,what happened,"this was the most disappointed i've ever been over an album. to say this is a little below (kweli's) average is an understatement. tracks 3,5,8,and 9 are HORRENDOUS. the beats on these tracks are disgusting and the lyrics seem random and without meaning. there are a FEW good tracks, mainly track 1, which makes you think the album is gonna be incredible, the last track is above average too (esp. for this album). i can't believe he's going COMMERCIAL, anyone who says he's not trying is crazy, HALFTIME AT MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, WHAT THE HELL!? i hope he realizes this is not the direction he should be going in and recovers on his next album. BUY ALL HIS OTHER ALBUMS RELEASED BEFORE THIS ONE, THOSE ARE INCREDIBLE"
4,Broken Glass,"Talib kweli is one of the best rappers in the game hands down. better than most of the crap you hear on the radio like lil flip or j kwon. This is a great album compared to most others in todays rap world but for Kweli it is missing something. It needs more Hi-Tek on the tracks. Although Hi-tek pops up for 3 tracks, the produciton on here (Just Blaze, Kanye West, Midi Mafia, Charlemegne,the Neptunes, ""supa"" Dave West) isnt as solid as we come to expect on a Kweli album. But still this album is worth the money especially if you are a big Talib Kweli fan like myself."
1,limp,"if you want some polite, well behaved, entirely house-brocken hiphop cop this. the album, much like Quality, is a polished, groomed, made up and dressed up corpse: lifeless and soul-less.loved Blackstar, but this is a waste of time."
2,Hear me out...,"Okay as a fan of blackstar and previous kweli... blah blah blah. I can sit here and tell you what else i like and this and that, but you just need to trust me on this one. I gave it 2 stars cuz well, the album is fairly weak. I bought the album with past credentials in mind BUT MAINLY because of the track ""never been in love."" tight nit lyrics even referencing Paris Hilton ""answering the phone"" layered over a sick beat. I figured that the rest of the album would hold up... and it DIDNT. Not that there arent other good songs on the album, cuz there are. Considering the names who lend help to Kweli neptunes, dj hi-tek, etc id expect better results. Moral of story: some good and decent singles, preview songs and purchase individually if youre not into stealing music."
4,Talib Shows His Range,"While many of the other reviewers were turned off by TK's attempts at capturing the mainstream audience, I think this CD demonstrates just how great an MC this man is. Sure, his earlier work was a bit more loyal to his underground roots, but this album is still a good joint -- worth the money. All the songs are consistently well-written and well-delivered, though the production is a bit lackadaisical on some tracks. Nevertheless, the fact TK can do underground music, enlighten listeners and still spit lyrics over an R&B track is a testament to his talent, not his attempt to go pop."
3,Kweli needs better production,"It's not bad production, it's just a little to plastic and bumpin for it's own good, he is such a phenomenal emcee he deserves nothing but the best...Yes there are some overtly catchy party anthems, somewhat watering down his ferociousness, but his overall content is still the only rap that cuts through emotionally over all others....If only more people would appreciate his message.."
3,"""BS"" is to Kweli what ""I Got Next"" was to KRS","For older hip-hop fans familiar with KRS-One, it would be helpful to know that the Beautiful Struggle is Kweli's ""I Got Next."" Upon the release of ""...Next,"" many ppl felt KRS-One had fallen off and gone ""pop"" by doing a song with Puff Daddy (Step Into A World RMX). Talib Kweli has received a similar respone with BS, and rightfully so. ""A-Game,"" despite being a solid club banger, and ""Work It Out"" are explicitly wack in terms of what fans expect out of Kweli. However, much of the LP is just a more mainstream version of his previous LPs, Quality and Train of Thought. ""Back Up Off Me"" bangs with a thunderous bassline reminiscent of ""Some Kind Of Wonderful"" and ""Black Girl Pain"" picks up where ""For Women"" left off. Overall the LP suffers from lackluster production and blatant mainstream appeal, but it is far suprerior to anything else the mainstream has to offer and Kweli remains lyrically sharp. Worth buying."
1,Not so beautiful,"I don't write reviews often as really music is personal taste but here we have a difficult situation: I love everything Talib has done up to this album but this is an album of covers and stuff that seems rushed or an attempt to change for changes sake. If you like his ""Quality"" album chances are you won't like this as it is really commercial and now sounds like everything else done by lesser artists in an attempt to what? go mainstream? real rap is not mainstream, any real roots-down hip-hop/rap fan knows this and sometimes a little bit of commerciality brings in the bucks to up the production quality but this is jaded stuff by Talib, with the now token ""get a kid to vocal over a track"" effect, we know he can do better and as a true fan I was dissapointed, by all means buy it but listen to it first!!!!!"
5,The TRUTH is back....,"Talib Kwali is the most underrated rapper in the rap game ever!!! This man alone is bringing back hip hop on his back...I LOVE Talib Kwali because he educates the listeners as well as entertains (Nas, 2Pac, Common, Mos Def, and Shyne are up there as well). I have not always been a fan of his until hip hop died 4 or 5 years ago... i decided to listen to underground people because they dont have all that glamour that all these rappers are seekin...PLEASE PEOPLE!!! if you have to listen to one hip hop artist... get a real rapper that's been through it all... TALIB KWALI...."
2,A Let Down With Weak Follow Up,"For a guy with so much talent, Talib's career is following the path of Cannibus rather than Common. Whether its his poor choice of production, his questionable hooks, or alarming drop-off in lyrical quality, Talib raised a lot of eyebrows with this weak follow up to the good, not great Quality. He still has the talent, which is glaringly obvious on the three good songs on the album, ""Ghetto Show"", ""Black Girl Pain"" and ""Beautiful Struggle"". Hopefully Talib's next album will mark a return to respectablility, but on this disaster, Talib let down his fans and hip-hop itself, which needs MC's of his caliber ripping it as much as possible."
3,Dosent sound like kweli,"Kanye really messed things up for kweli as he helped in the production. The album has kweli lyrics, but not the kweli sound. It sounds too much like mainstream garbage. Yuck! Its better to get his other 2 solo cds. Peace out."
1,Quit praising this moron,"He's not underground, he's not overground, he's inbetween and that makes him mediocre. Incidentally, he happens to be just that, uninspired, boring, and uninteresting. I reserve the same for faux-underground acts like Aesop Rock and Sage Francis, however this guy along with Kanye West is regarded as underground by a LOT of dumbasses who wouldn't know the first thing about hip-hop. While I do give my respect to nowaday's popular rappers that somehow manage to rap to these repulsive and banal beats, but then again they're not that good and they don't have anything even remotely interesting to say, as is the case with Kweli. He may be popular on the streets, where people are too ignorant to know the difference between him and a class act like KRS-ONE, but in somebody's living room, he's embarrassing. Save your money and research the genre before you purchase what your friends tell you to."
3,Truth Be Told....,"Talib has done it again. Now it is not as good as quality as far as every song being damn near playable..but it holds its on. I think if he would have tried to make this album longer it good be a very average album. Trks 2,3 and 6 are below average in my opinion and should have not been but on this album. 2 of the 3 i just mentioned are so corny.Now...the rest of the album is bangin'. He's still spitting knowledge, clever word play, and fittin' beats. The bad reviews i feel are coming from comparing this album to Quality (big mistake)....If u can make it pass those 3 songs i mentioned u should be all good. Hotep!!!"
2,What?,"Uhh..... I guess i should have seen it coming after quality but, I wasn't expecting it so soon. After Reflection Eternal split up kweli has slowley gone down hill. His lyrics arent as strong and the production is just plain WACK! I miss Train of Thought and Black on Both sides. Those albums were Revolutionary. This is not close, but it could be worse.... It could be Chingy!"
5,Antoine(The Demon) Florida,"this album is hot. Talib did a great job like ""Never been in love"" and ""Ghetto Show"". His beats are hot, his lyrics are hot and its about time hes on mtv and bet. he deserves it ya'll. He's been out for a long time and still keeps his spot, i idolize him because i never heard him say nothing wack and he is the best mc alive right now and is a legend"
3,I'm Sorry,"There are some times when you don't want to give the truth and accept the way things were back in the day. Reflection Eternal obtained Midnight Mauraders status to me (Timeless). Quality was ""decent"". But this album just have too many cons than pros. Lyrics are never a guestion or suspect. And the producers weren't that bad, but like most albums, this was not cohesive at all in which he strives in. He needs to go back to Mood (producers for people who don't know about them) and develop a classic album again.Top 3 songs: I Try, Black Girl Pain, We KnowBottom 3 Songs: We Got A Beat, Work It Out, Broken GlassSleeper: Beautiful Struggle"
4,Intelligent Music,I really enjoyed this album and pretty much anything Talib Kweli has come out with. I first downloaded it to check it out and liked it enough to make the purchase. This album still gets spins in my car.
4,Untitled,"I wasn't sure what to title this review but the album is pretty nice. Going Hard starts with heavy horns before shifting into the main beat. I really like his R&b tracks; We KNow with Faith Evans, I Try with Mary J., Around My Way with John Legend, and Nevre Been in Love. Hi Tek also provieds a really hot beat for Work it Out and Ghetto Show & Black Girl Pain showcase some serious lyrics. The album's title track and closing is another great track. The album flows pretty well and will be appreciated for years to come"
2,definetly a struggle,"now ive been following Talib Kweli since his days of rhyming with Mood and the WannaBattle crew. I Still can't understand why he has lost his organic roots to produce tracks that have pushed him into the hip-POP crowd. I would definetly consider 'Train of Thought' one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time .. the chemistry between Hi-Tek and Talib is unbelievable.. so when Talib's first solo project 'Quality' was a disappointment (definetly not worth that title), i figured in Talib's second solo album he would try to collaberate with Hi-Tek and Mos Def a little more, instead Mos was traded for Mary J. Blige and other R and B artists while Hi-Tek produces the more mainstream west coast sound versus his previous jazzy organic beats killing the underground sound. I only pray Talib will reflect on his previous tracks and get back on the subway TRAiN (of Thought) to the underground where he belongs and is trully appreciated."
1,Talib's fallen off,"I've tried to get into this album but can't.. The beats are too hard and overproduced for a Kweli album. This album sounds more like Jigga's ""Black Album,"" (with whack-ass beats and overproduction), much like most of the over-commercialized crap on the radio today. Talib's still a gifted rapper with a clear messege but I seriously miss his (or Hi-Tek produced) laid back beats and smooth ryhming style that's made him an underground icon. He's now gone too mainstream/pop. Sorry, this album is weak."
4,"Ok, check it...","Talib Kweli is nasty, i'm not tellin u anything new. He's in fact prob. my 2nd fav. MC (Pharoahe Monch is #1) Now Quality (which was slightly better than this) was a hot cd. Beautiful Struggle was a hot cd, but I constantly ask myself if I would like Talib so much if Reflections Eternal never existed. Maybe I would cause of Blackstar but still, you feel me? I'm not sayin he fell off or anythin like that cause he's lyrically too good to ever fall off, but I think he owes us another Reflections Eternal (and when I say that I don't literally mean it has to be Reflections Eternal part 2, I just mean an album of the same greatness) Don't you agree? Anyway like I said i'm not hatin on Talib, i'll always support him it's just something to think about."
5,Beautiful!,"This is one of my all-time favorite CDs. I loved all the songs on this CD except one. My favorite is ""Black Girl Pain"" and it should be an anthem and inspriration for Black women all over the globe. I had the pleasure of seeing Talib in concert a few months ago in Atlanta and his live show was even better than his CD. True Hip-hop lives!"
3,What happened,This Album gets a 3.5 but it could have gotten a 4... Maybe if he would have kept to the production of the bootlegged unmixed version.. By adding two additional cheesy songs and a few un-needed guest stars that were not on the bootlegged album the album fell short..I liked Quality but this one i can't openly tell my friends to support.. It seems to me that Mos Def has grown and Talib has grown tired.. I know that's harsh.. But i think Talib should have slowed down and re-evaluated where he wanted to go with his music.. Wanting to be main stream should not destroy your creativity.
5,The Beautiful Struggle,"This CD is awesome and in my opinion Talib's best work he has put out. You can go through this CD from beginning to end an pretty much love every song. Talib's lyrics are up there with anyone in rap. The best songs on the CD would be: Going Hard, Broken Glass, We Know, I Try, Around My Way, Ghetto Show, and Beautiful Struggle. Hope this helps out"
4,"Good/Great, Better than most of the Garbage Out There","Having Quality and Right About Now, this is his weakest overall album but it is still great. The production lags a little on the weak cuts but the good cuts are superb. If your looking for something that you don't listen to everyday on the radio and a breathe of fresh air in this rap mess I would advice you to pick up all of Talib's cd because he is the BK MC.TOP 3Going HardI TryBlack Girl Pain"
1,"Wow, this was bad!","Apart from the fact that the main 'heroine' literally talks outloud to herself (And then answers aloud), in their initial meeting the 'hero' saves her from two would-be rapists and then proceeds to bathe her and put her naked in his bed once she faints (creepy!). Oh, and the heroine has an imaginary lover named 'Loverboy' who's existence ensures she comes across as pathetic to readers.This book is FULL of 'huh?' moments and phrases (the above is just the tip of the iceberg). Not a pleasant reading experience."
3,Question on use- poor support,"I bought this phone last week and it works but can someone tell me how to dial out without using my computer to dial or the contacts to dial? I dial using the phone, hit the left call button and nothing happens. Contacts work but not when I dial using the phone. Thanksjellero@yahoo.com"
2,"Good for environment, but hard and doesn't flush well.","I bought this product because I'm trying to become more green. I didn't expect it to be as thick as it is, so when my son uses it (and too much) it doesn't flush well, and I end up using the plunger. It isn't very soft either, so doesn't always feel pleseant when wiping. After the case I bought is gone, I'm going to look for a softer, more flushable ""green"" toliet tissue. I have an old house, and old pipes, and this paper just doesn't go down very good unless it has sat there for a while. I don't recommend if you have an old house/pipes. I keep soft tissue on hand for when I have guests or need a break from this particular kind. If you don't care about softness or clogged toilets, by all means this is the product for you!"
4,Does the job,"Now the one posted in the picture, it's green label means cheap made in china but it works and the case is nice."
5,great,great movies for a great price! good good good good good good then great great great Have a good day
3,"TCM Greatest Classic Films Collection: Tarzan, Vol. 2 DVD","Hey, it's 5-Time Undefeated Olympic Gold Medalist Johnny Weissmuller as Tarzan - what else needs to be said?The disc quality is good at best, with fair sound and picture. My main beef with the disc is that the movies are NOT in widescreen."
4,Made a great gift,This collection of Tarzan movies brought back many memories of Sunday movies in the receivers youth. The price was comparable and the video quality was good.
2,Not what you are looking for,"This bugle is a pretty good deal. There are only a few problems. One is that it is badly out of tune but cannot be tuned (I think that is because of the mouthpiece size, I recommend that you get a standard trumpet mouthpiece). The other problem is that there is no spit valve and therefore no way to drain your spit. Otherwise, it is a very good deal."
2,"Halfway decent, but Disney's CDs are a lot better","Unlike many CDs of children's music I can name, the singing is all right. However, the reason I only gave this two stars is because a lot of the songs are cut short, with entire verses deleted. Some of them, like ""There's A Hole In The Bucket,"" have half the song cut out.And I think the title is misleading: How exactly are ""My Darling Clementine"" and ""Old Dan Tucker,"" not to mention many of the others, silly songs?I bought it for two dollars at a garage sale, so I can't really complain. If you're looking for a good compilation of children's music, I would suggest the Disney CDs (which, by the way, are sung in regular human voices rather than by Mickey, Donald, and Goofy, contrary to what one might expect)."
2,Missing cultural tags!,Excel Saga has been around long enough for you to know about it; so I am leaving this review simplistic and guessing you want to know about this release and not the actual show. This is a passable re-release HOWEVER it is missing the cultural tags which could be found in all previous releases. These tags are essential to understanding much of the humor that is inherent in the Saga. So do not buy this rendition unless you want to miss out on what really makes this show move from mediocre to great.
3,Cool product but very lightweight,"These chairs will be perfect for when we take our 1967 Mustang to shows or cruises. We hope they will last a few seasons. Construction is of the lightweight type (hinges and connectors), which we hope will withstand the test of time! We'll see!"
3,"High Quality, but only 1 foot (.3 meters)!!","The quality of the cable is excellent, but the length is only 1 foot. At the time of this writing it doesn't indicate length anywhere on the Amazon.com page for this item. I guess it's my mistake for assuming it would be the more standard one meter rather than something shorter. If that's the length you need, you will be very pleased with this cable -- it has the same look and feel of a Monster-brand cable. But I can't imagine very many practical uses for a 12-inch cable. Even if I placed my set top box directly on top of my 34"" television it would still not reach the part of the back panel with the HDMI port."
3,Could this possibly happen?,"Final Flight an interesting book that keeps you intrigued for most of the time. Technical data is accurateand the story very scary if any part of it could become reality. Two very long flights went by in a jiffyas I was concentrated on this book. Don't read many novels, so hard to rate."
3,This book great!,Book reviewThe final flight even thought I haven't finished it it seem to be a good book about the times of war and the guys who have mission and they explain how life was during war its intersing.My opinion is that it is a great book and because I haven't finished it I can't tell you the ending of the book I rate it 3 out of 5 stars.I would give it to some who like adventure books I'm also sure that you can find in any local library or local school library. The final flight is an cool book.
5,An Adventurous Read,"This is Stephen Coonts sequel to the wonderful read ""Flight of the Intruder"". Although the book originally came out in the late 80's and the Navy doesn't fly F-14 Tomcats any more...this book is a great novel that talks about terrorists who make a grab for a nuclear weapon to target Isarel.It was hard to put down and a great read. Must say Stephen Coonts is a wonderful adventure writer.Jeannie Walker - Award Winning Author of ""Fighting the Devil"" - A True Story of Consuming Passion, Deadly Poison, and Murder"
5,Excellent Thriller Book,Long time without reading a book that has kept me into it from beginning to end. Excellent thriller and great novel.
2,Poorly researched,"The author needs to research his subject. Having spent 8 years in the navy I know the one word you never use is ""repeat"" over the radio or any com circuit. You have terrorists on board a ship that has nuclear weapons and you stand around and ask I wounder what they are after. The terrorists get away in a helicopter and you don't have the support ship radio to NAS Naples or the NATO base at Sigonella you try and get your decks cleared so you can lunch a aircraft. The FLIGHT OF THE INTRUDER was a good book this was not."
5,A great read,"Another well written thriller by someone that has lived the naval pilots life. Great read, had me on the edge of my seat."
3,Not for beginners,"Being a beginner, I was hoping to see at least one chapter of ""how to jump"" or even a few chapters on ""beginning freestyle jumps"". But, if you are an experienced jumper, this book is for you. Great pics and instructions. Just too advanced for my abilities."
3,A quick summary but nothing detailed,"I was a little disappointed in this video. It doesn't offer anything new concerning our fights for freedom and independence. And despite the video's claim that the revolution evolved from a social evolution of the 1770s, most historians I know would say that Americans began rebelling against British rule after the end of the French-Indian wars, if not sooner, because of Britain's insistence that the American colonies pay their share of taxes to the crown for helping them fight the French. The colonists didn't see it that way.Although this video may be helpful for a middle-school history class, I'd skip it and recommend a more detailed video on the American revolution instead. The history channel's own video on the revolution is quite detailed (despite cheesy reenactments).Rent this from the library but I'd discourage anyone from buying this superficial coverage of our early American history."
4,Spiros is right..,"The Burns stories were beter,but there's a big difference between $100.00 and $1.22."
3,Canna,"Whelp bought this for last year, 3 plants and they were beautiful. Dug them up in the fall and replanted this spring and although I got foliage, no flowers AT ALL. I am disappointed to say the least. I guess you need to stick with the red hardy variety. I will not purchase additional ones."
4,Lol...,"I agree with one reviewer...if you have been to Patts and forgot your video camera...show your friends this...they will go...lol As far as the film itself...beautiful Thai woman...average Farang men...bad dubbing...cheesy story line...terrible music and shaky camera operating...lol. But I give them credit and I love it. Let me think...""how can I figure out some way to write off my trip to Pattaya?"" I know...I'll make a movie and write it all off...lol. So 4 stars for the efforts"
1,Sucked,"This movie sucked and there is only one scene containing sex, the other scene you see boobs at the beginning when they are changing and that is it.I do not recommend buying this movie because all it is really is a couple of Thai chicks running around on vacation doing normal stuff not really talking just giggling the whole time with no dialogue."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,OMG!! I can't believe that this DVD has 3.5 stars. The write ups must be false reviewers. Technically its a very poorly made DVD I thing I could of done better using MS Movie Maker. The voice overs were a joke most of the time there is just music in the background. The plot if you can call it a plot is like a porno plot (at least in the porno you have complete nudity). I should of know better..... Do not waste your money on this DVD.
3,Dissapointed,"I enjoyed the preview, but the movie was all over the place. Would have been better without the DORKY looking guys that co-stared."
3,"not bad, but not great","this CD is OK for helping me drift off, but I'm not crazy with how it is laid out. The voice is a little off-putting. So it did the trick, but defnitely not my stand by for when I am worried about getting to sleep....I basically just occassionally use it b/c I spent money to get it and want to get something for my investment."
2,"crap, crap, and more...dennis...i mon...i mean crap! typos!","this game is absolute crap, i hate it in every way possible, i do not want to see it ever again in my freaking life, never! it is boring and confusing!"
1,Boring and slow,"I thought the Clock Tower games looked interesting, but I was sorely disappointed. The controls (point-and-click) are out-of-date and sometimes do not make sense, the voice acting is AWFUL, the movements are SLOW, the graphics are mediocre, the storyline (as much as I could handle) was corny... There are many endings to the game, but who can sit through it?VERDICT: Don't even rent this one, unless you are a HUGE (and curious) fan of the first game."
2,"Dissapointing, but scary...","This game is quite the stupid type. But, soon it get's scarrier and more dark. I found it very scary, being a little kid and all. Though, I wouldn't reccomend buying it. It's really a bad storyline and the graphics are horrible (except for the beginning appearence.) This game is really a bad game!"
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I have two small dogs that I can't keep off my sofa, so I really need this thing. OK, it's not perfect... it does have a bit of a leakage problem, and it's a little messy to use. Also, if you're expecting to extract all the water, you're going to be somewhat disappointed. Maybe my expectations were a little lower than some other reviewers because I've used a full-size 12 amp carpet cleaner (upholstery attachment), and it wasn't the greatest either - basically had the same kinds of problems. But, if you're willing to put in some elbow grease, this cleaner actually does a pretty good job. Keep in mind, you'll have to settle for some ""post"" drying time. I had previously bought a Dirt Devil Spot Scrubber, which I promptly returned - it had absolutely no suction power. I think this one is worth the $55 I spent on it."
1,The first Atlantis was destroyed; this one should be too!,"The first, and only time, I tried to use this compact carpet cleaner was a total disaster. While removing an old sofa to make way for new furniture, the delivery men stained the new carpet. I whipped out our new Atlantis, filled the rinse tank and popped in the soap cartridge. With manual in hand, I tried to quickly clean the carpet as the new furniture was making its way up the stairs... The unit did not dispense soapy water, the hand-held wand leaked, and finally I discovered that the body of the until was leaking all over my carpet, creating a soggy new stain. So here I am with two stains on my now very wet carpet, furniture being delivered and an Atlantis unit sitting in my bathtub until I can find a large sledge hammer. Don't waste your money with this thing. There has to be a better answer."
1,Eureak Atlantis Express is junk.,"Bought a Eureak Atlantis Express to clean up my couch which had some stains. It didn't work right even before I even turned it on. I filled the clean water tank with water and put it back into the unit, exactly as directed in the instructions. It LEAKED water through the vents at the bottom for the motor. So I thought maybe I did something wrong, so I tried it again, and it leaked water through the motor vents again. Its like it is missing some extremely critical parts, which it probably is. I havn't even turned this piece of junk on and I gonna return it. Dont waste your time or money on this machine."
5,Great buy,"I am very pleased with this ring. I have had several compliments on it. The sizing is perfect, the stone is brilliant and the prongs are even. It is very good craftsmanship and exactly what I was looking for. I placed the ordered and received my ring 2 days later. Good customer service and fast delivery."
2,Heavy on Attitude -- light on Substance,"""Leaning into Six Sigma"" provides a few hours of entertaining reading, but only brushes the surface of Six Sigma. Written in the tradition of ""The Goal"" by Eliyahu Goldratt, ""Leaning into Six Sigma"" doesn't live up that book's success at explaining complex business/operations concepts even while telling a compelling story. While Sam Micawh, the protagonist, certainly can't be faulted for being boring, the brazen attitude bestowed upon her by the authors, and the patronizing tone with which the client company's employees are addressed, only serve to reinforce the negative stereotype of ""the arrogant consultant."" This fault makes me hesitant to recommend ""Leaning into Six Sigma"" ..."
5,A nice roadmap for integrating Lean & Six Sigma. A must read,"The authors Mills, Wheat and Carnell tell an engaging story.... a story of a consultant helping a client achieve operational breakthrough in phases, what in the end turns out to be a natural deployment of Lean & Six Sigma for the organization. The narrative is lucid, interesting, insightful, well organized and ""lean"" (only 100 pages, I finished it in one night). A no-frills, no-nonsense book that also delves into the issues & constraints that a consultant may face, and shows how to overcome them.A highly recommended read for teams starting the journey towards Six Sigma and Lean implementation, for champions & leaders in those areas, CEOs of companies looking to deploy SS and Lean and all those Six-Sigma lovers that are out there and harboring a secret desire to get into consulting some day."
1,A Weak Six Sigma Primer,"I have read several books on Six Sigma and found this one to be extremely weak on content and heavy on the current Buzz Words! As a basic book on Six Sigma you better have a Six Sigma dictionary by your bedside to let you know what the authors are trying to tell the reader. If you are familiar with Six Sigma then you don't need to read the book. The tale is simply written and a easy read but makes the process of Six Sigma ""a walk in the factory"". I believe the story doesn't give anybody associated with any improvement processes any real insight and the book may be best described as a fairy tale at best. Any of the well known texts from Pete Pande and team do a much better job in providing the basics of process improvement."
5,Leaning into Six Sigma,Any CEO and Top Mgt. staff who are thinking of entering into the Lean Mfg. and Six Sigma improvement world should read this book. It is a modern day fable about a company who must improve to stay in business and decide to hire a consultant to help pick the right new machine to fix all their quality and cycle time problems. It is very easy reading on your next short trip. Everyone can identify someone in the book they can relate with. Must reading for the entire team starting to implement six sigma and lean.
5,"Great Product, Great Taste","This is my favorite B-12 I've taken! A way better tasting one than others I've tried. You put it under your tongue and let it dissolve, a pleasant orange taste. Did not leave a bad aftertaste for me and did not have a terrible texture like others I've tried. Will purchase again!"
5,Holds Well Even When Heating,This vise worked well while I heated my phone and replaced glass. I was able to use both hands which made the job much easier!!
2,Suction cup doesn't work,Vice is still and difficult to open/close but I suspect it would loosen up over time. The the suction cup base leaks and releases after only a few minutes.Could not recommend.
5,Great Vise,"Great Vise compact, Excellent mounting suction, just what I needed for small projects, I am using vise for electrical board repair."
4,Good value. I recommend it.,"I bought this so I could work on an iPhone (for repair). I have two other panavise vise products, both of which are metal with some ABS plastic parts.I like the vacuum base. It works very well on my wooden bench. Very easy to get it attached, and a simple locking mechanism.The articulating arm has a good range, and the tightening mechanism works well. It gripped my iPhone4 nicely and was very solid.The screw used for moving the clamping arms is a little smaller than I'd have preferred, which is making me wonder if it will hold up to a heavier load. The clamping arms are also plastic, which showed when I was tightening the vise to hold the phone. It worked, but at one point I began to wonder if they should have been made of metal.Sorry for the basic review, but I wanted to get it out there that my experience with this vise is a good one."
4,"Good, but not perfect","It's a very versatile product, no doubt about it! I love the gripping mechanism as well as the practically unlimited motion of the gripper, but the suction cup left much to be desired. For those who have a clean plastic or metal surface the product is great and grips excellently and this is definitely the product for you! But for those of us who have wooden or less perfect surfaces the cup almost never sticks well and required me to purchase a ceramic tile to mount it on."
5,Not just another Christmas movie,"Came across the movie on Netflix 3 years ago...never heard of it up untill then. Hilarious, raunchy, and a Christmas must see. Bought one for my brothers 2 years ago and now one for my own DVD collection. You won't be disappointed!"
1,This is a mislisting,I tried to order this from one of the vendors and was told that it was a mistaken listing.
3,Werewolf?,"The title leaves much to the imagination, and ghost stories are a blessing from mundane novelling anytime. However, 'Room 13' is a far cry from a blessing in disguise.The tale of a teacher in a classroom haunted by a previous eccentric teacher is a great plot, but the werewolf fitted throughout the book should have been left out. It doesn't fit the story at all. And the novel had a great basis without it."
4,Quick guide to good tools,"Easily readable. Excellent for beginners(Oops, ltt, valgrind, /proc). Some boring sections(ps, network debugging tools).In the next version, it would be nice to have Xenmon, SystemTap, Perfmon2 & section on general hw counters (TLB miss, memory latency). Two pages(277-278) for cache misses is weak."
2,"Moderately useful, doesn't go in-depth","The book does give a broad overview of linux debugging and profiling. The coverage is useful for a newbie but doesn't really add much value for the experienced linux programmer. It doesn't really cover any ""performance tuning"" except for a chapter on profiling. The real negative of this book for me is the screen shots of untarring a tool or applying a patch. These are just page wasting tactics and I hate it when authors resort to such tricks to fill pages."
4,Good book to learn debugging Linux from,"The previous commentator is misleading. Although the book doesn't really give very elaborate examples, it's at least good enough to introduce the reader to the subjects and tools as a starting point to dig around himself. The materials are certainly not all for beginners.I gave it 4 stars, relative to 5 given to its sister book, ""Linux Programming by Example: The Fundamentals"" in the same series, which is much more refined."
1,only for Linux beginner,"If you knows Linux system well enough, don't buy this book. This is only for Linux beginner and doesn't have enough detail to go deep enough inside Linux. You may better off just looking at internet."
4,works but not easy to use,I have several of these. I break my rating down to Price and function 5 stars but ease of use would be a 2. It takes some practice to get them on the calendar (or poster or etc.). The trick is to start in one corner and pull the frame piece on (sort of like a sock). Do not try to jam the whole edge of the calendar in at one time - that is difficult if not impossible. Once in place they work great to keep the poster stretched usably taught.
5,Excellent,"We use the GNC brand of inositol but I wanted to comment on inositol in general. The powder disolves well in room temperature liquid and has a slightly sweet taste so it is tolerated well in juices. 600mg 2x a day cured my son of his OCD and sensory issues (he has an ASD). I found the right dose is the key. Started very small and worked up, got too high and mania kicked in, so reduced back to previous dose and all was good. It was a miracle for us, solved issues that had been present and getting worse for 10 years. He has been on it for almost a year now and no symptoms have returned. Great product."
5,Wonderful,"This product dissolves very well, tastes sweet and is nice even in water, and has helped my 12-year-old son with his anxiety and OCD (he takes a total of 20 grams per day.) He was even able to (on his own!) give up a few of his OCD rituals. This does not cure OCD or anxiety, but it helps my son cope much better than without it."
5,"works great for anxiety, and insomnia!","I heard about this product through a friend who struggles with anxiety, (as do I) and decided to give it a try. WOW, major difference! It definitely took the edge off the things that would normally give me anxiety throughout the day. As for the insomnia, I use to wait for my husband to get home from work (he works grave-yard) and stay up with him until I was so tired i would just pass out, now when i put my kids to sleep, i usually end up falling asleep with them! It's great. So glad I gave this a try, I am a believer that this is a great replacement for over the counter meds for anxiety!! When i am out, i'm definitely buying another round (another perk is how long it last) I have been taking a 1/4 a tps a day for the last few month. Such a good buy!"
5,Perfect seller,"Item shipped quickly, and was just as indicated. I have been taking this inositol for a few months now, and though it's more expensive, I prefer it to the Jarrow brand. I have noticed a decrease with my OCD when I take 12g/day."
3,inositol hype,"I bought this after reading a review stating the quality was better, i.e more potent resulting in noticeable effects. I purchased the 2 ounce version to test this. The price is approximately twice the Swanson inositol I.ve been using. No noticeable difference and there was a grainy residue. In addition, the manufacturer states a longer wait for product (4-5 days) and indeed it took 4-5 days and then some, but I couldn.t help feeling disappointed in the shipping time when the other orders Amazon handles have been so quick in getting to me."
2,Limited Info,"This is a very very basic beginner introduction to both of these programs. I ended up going through all of the book material very quickly and ended up learning a lot more from Macromedia's site tutorials.Be advised, this is a beginners introduction."
3,Very very basic,I bought this based on recommendations of reviewers and was disappointed. Way too basic. Most of the material I had already figured out just noodling around with the options in the menus. Oh well.... Was hoping to save buying more detailed books on both programs. Guess It was too much to hope for.
5,Mustard Plug's newest album is by far one of their best!,"This album is the next best album to ""Evil doers beware!"" It's fast, tight, wild, and full of energy for any music lover especially those into punk and ska!"
5,Better than I would have imagined!,"I was incredibly skeptical about buying diamond earrings online-even though it *is* Amazon. But, with a generous return policy (30 days), I thought I had nothing to loose. Boy oh boy, these earrings are more beautiful than any pair I ever looked at in the offline world! I couldn't be happier!And, the price?!?!? For the cut, clarity, color, and platinum setting, the price can't be beat!"
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with the format. I wanted a complete rosary said with each set of mysteries--That means an Apostles Creed, 3 Hail Marys and 1 Glory Be everytime you begin a different set of mysteries. Also I did not want other narratives regarding the particular mystery--just the prayers, please. Also, the sound of the male voice was not consistent --Sometimes loud, sometimes soft and overall hard to hear."
1,I never got the book!,"I was just going through product ratings and realized that I had never gotten this book in the mail!! I can't believe it! Because I obviously bought awhile ago and forgot I did, there's nothing I can do about it now besides buy ANOTHER one and HOPE I get it this time! -Gee Whiz."
4,Managable!,"This new book offers something different to other Managerial Economics Textbooks that I have seen. For a start it is a shorter book than others like Mcguigan et al. Secondly, it looks and feels like a textbook, but it also is a remarkably good book to read - I read through several chapters on the train. Thirdly, it brings a completely new approach with it - that of Game Theory. Anyone who's been alive for the last few years will realise just how important Game Theory is in Business and Economics, and the deployment of it in a book on managerial economics is a master stroke.Personally I have found it to be a breath of fresh air in comparison to its competitors, and I would say to anyone teaching, studying or just intererested in Managerial Economics - read this book!"
3,CATZ Reveiw,"Its the kind of game that is better played 5 to 10 minutes at a time. Its like Tamagotgi or Giga Pets, when their stats are high, ther's nothing much to do."
5,My hair smells amazing!,No only does this jell make your hair silky and shinny but it smells amazing! I found this originally at a Japanese hair salon and now can purchase it on Amazon!
3,Crappy faucet!,"I read the negative reviews about the hardware and still bought it thinking that I would be ok as long as I'm careful and there were very good reviews about the filter itself. Well, the white plastic part that screws into the base of the faucet broke as we were installing it. I ended up buying another faucet from the store. I would suggest that you just buy the filter from Culligan and get the faucet separately."
1,Flood!,"Plastic assembly broke without warning or abuse and flooded my cabinet and kitchen floor. Culligan actually installed this unit for me two years ago and when they came to repair it they had little to say except it had a bad ""o"" ring. They retrofitted a regular Culligan faucet and said it would last forever! Hope so, now my cabinet door is warped and won't shut. The shame is that the water tasted great, but the mechanics were not built to last.Culligan - you can do better!!"
1,disappointed,"This was installed properly but does not improve the flavor of the tap water at all as described, and our tap water is not that bad. I even tried adding lemon to a glass of water but no help in getting a refreshing glass of water, not even good for making coffee. I have left 2 messages with Culligan to return my call, nothing. We're very disapointed in it so it's being returned."
2,Flooded my kitchen,"After 11 months of service the plastic stem of the faucet broke and flooded my kitchen cabinet and the basement wall. I have yet to see the warranty response, however I highly recommend a Watts Premier Chrome Non Air-Gap Faucet to install from the start. Otherwise, filters are cheap, the water quality is good. But Culligan going for a one or two dollar saving using plastic faucet part under strain vs. the liability of flooding a house demonstrates very bad judgment from Culligan."
2,Poor Design- cause a lot of leak. Would have to buy separate parts!!,"I saw the rating on amazon and it seem like a good buy to replace the old filter. When I started the installation, the faucet stem was to short which only allows the plastic stem nut to screw in but there was no space left to screw the plastic tube to connect to the faucet stem of the filter. I had to run several times to Home Depot and buy separate parts. After 6 hours later, I finally finished the installation. I turned on the water and water was just squirting everywhere. In addition, I also had to cut the spout nut shorter to make room on the faucet stem to connect the water tube line which involve me filing the spout nut. I was expecting a 20 to 40 minutes installation but it took me over 7 hours to finally get the job done. If I have know it would be like this, I would have bought a different product."
4,An excellent filtering system,"This has eliminated the need to buy bottled water from my home, as well as keeping pitchers of filtered water around. Whenever I want good, clean water, I get it from the faucet of the filtering system. The flow is almost as fast as the regular faucet. The only reason I can't give this a 5 star is because the faucet is a bit flimsy, and I worry about breaking it."
4,Culligan US EZ-4 water filter review,"Followed directions to install under my sink. I am not the handiest person around when it comes to plumbing, but I had very little trouble installing the filter. I especially like the easy way you can change the filter unlike other brands I have had that require a special wrench to loosen the filters. The water quality has definitly improved. It remains to be seen how long the filter lasts since I just installed it although the manufacturer says change every six months."
1,Test water coming out from the filter!!,"I did a test for PH, Hardness, Chlorine, Alkalinity, Copper, Nitrate, and TDS. The test was done 1 before the filter and 1 after the filter. I found no differene with the test answers and the TDS level between the two are arond the same (400). Please get a test kit and TDS reader and test yours to make sure your filter is working as needed. I got this to beable to drink tap water and for my baby. This was a waste, bottle water is way better as seen from the tests. PS: JEA Florida water has a lead level of 15ppm."
1,Not as good as it used to be,"Started to leak after two years of use. Has Culligan gone the way of the rest of the ""make-it-disposable"" business culture?"
1,Culligan under sink water ysytem,This water tap is made of cheap plastic. The tap broke during installation. We had to go to Home Depot to buy a new water dispenser so we could finish the install and get some filtered water.If they had only spent a few more dollars to make metal dispenser maybe it would be ok.We will not buy Culligan again - they make junk.
3,The product itself is good but the connectors doesn't not fit to different pipe,The product itself is good but the connectors doesn't not fit to different pipes. So I have to buy extra connectors and take some time to install.
3,"Cheap plastic parts, but working for now","Other reviewers commented on the poor quality plastic faucet, which I agree seems very flimsy, but my initial problem was with the plastic diverter that connects to the cold water supply line. I immediately cross threaded it with my ancient plumbing, making it unusable. Luckily there is a local Culligans dealer in town so I went there and got a brass fitting to replace the plastic one, and the unit is now installed and working fine. The water tastes great, but we've just had it for a few days. Definitely seems like they skimped on quality here."
3,Get the IC-EZ-4 instead,The filter and quick change housing gets five stars but the cheap faucet drops this to two or three. I would recommend getting the IC-EZ-4 model which is the same filter but not the faucet. It's $20 cheaper and then you can then get a quality faucet such as the one from Crystal Clear for $30.
1,"Worked well, UNTIL the leaks started","This seems like a pretty good deal at first.It was pretty easy to install and the water quality is good. But after 18 months, the socket that the filter installs into began a steady drip, drip, drip under the sink. I'm pretty sure it's not the O-rings, because installing a new filter (with new o rings) didn't help at all.Unfortunately, there is no support from Culligan - if I don't want to sacrifice the extra 2 filters I bought, I need to buy this unit over again (no parts available).No, thanks. I'm looking for another company that actually stands behind their product."
3,Be sure to pick up a faucet at your favorite big box store,"I read the reviews including the part about the plastic faucet that broke for several other reviewers. I thought I was armed with the knowlege that would prevent the faucet from breaking at my my house. I was wrong. It broke before I even got it mounted. I love the filter the price, but the faucet is a joke and Culligan should have redesigned it by now"
2,"Terrible faucet, good filter, flooded kitchen & basement","Filter works good but after about 8 months the plastic faucet broke and flooded under the sink, on the floor in kitchen, and went downstairs to destroy drop ceiling and soak into the subfloor and rafters. Crossing fingers about mold and mildew. This was even with a replacement faucet that Culligan sent since the first one broke upon installation.GET A GOOD METAL FAUCET!!!!!!!!"
3,Flimsy + non-standard connector,"Just installed, haven't checked water yet, assuming the water quality will be fine. =)- In principle its an easy install, but..- In practice it took two trips to hardware store since they provide a 1/2"" pipe connector, but most modern faucets are 3/8"" compression, and I had to find the right pieces to make it all fit together.- Also, if you don't have a hole yet, you have to drill a 5/8"" hole. Most drill bit sets are only up to 1/2"", and drilling a stainless steel sink doesn't work well. Still sorting that part of the puzzle out.- Also agree that the faucet seems so flimsy its bound to break off."
3,Good Filter...The rest is junk.,"Came missing one of the plastic connectors..No big deal as you would eventually regret installing this thing with the laughable parts sent with it..Went to the big box store and bought copper compression connectors and a decent metal water dispenser..Also bought an in line copper valve to regulate the water pressure to the filter head as I really don't trust the push in and hope it locks hose fittings to the head.Water tastes fine and even better I can sleep without one ear open, waiting for that awful hissing sound of a broken water connection."
1,Flood Hazard,"Make sure that your home owners insurance is paid if you have this filter. I just had the third filter fail, doing substantial damage to my home. I should have pulled it when the fist one failed but they replaced it at no charge and I figured what the heck everyone makes a bad part once in awhile. I really really should have pulled it when the replacement cartridge that they sent also cracked along the same seam. Now that the third one, sent direct from the manufacturor which I would have assumed to have been an updated design, the whole thing goed in the garbage.I also had the cheap threaded nylon tube crack when first installed. Also had the head start leaking. They did replaced both.When it wasn't leaking it did do a good job."
4,Kinda plastic-y but works great,"Pros:-water tastes good-faucet looks good-installation was relatively easy-changing filter cartridges will be super easyCons:-faucet is a little wiggly and plastic metal piece at base of spout is especially suspect-only came with a line splitter for 1/2"" pipes, but most modern homes have 3/8"" pipes.Tips:-don't bother drilling holes in your cabinet under the sink, just set the entire thing upright under the sink in a stable fashion.-if you have 3/8"" pipes buy an ""add-a-tee adapter"" with 3/8"" on the ends and 1/4"" on the side, plus a thingy to connect that to 1/4"" tubing (lowes will know what you're talking about)"
2,clligan us-ez-4 system,"the water fauset come with it is made out of plastic. i broke mine during installation. even if i didn't break it, it is a time bomb waiting to happen."
4,"Good water filter, but flimsy filter bracket","This is a good water filter and we have been using it for a few years now. The faucet was relatively simple to install and with the highest level filter the water seems to be very clean. Our only problem is the bracket that holds the filter is a somewhat flimsy plastic and it was not easy to get the replacement filter to ""twist on"", as they say you should. We didn't line it up quite right and the whole thing broke, spewing water everywhere! So I would advise being very careful when you are changing the filter."
1,"No, no, no. They're garbage.","The other review on here is completely wrong. You CAN flake off the top of the CD-R with just your fingernail, or even a fine-tipped Sharpie. Sure, you can be careful with them, but varying levels of humidity will render these discs useless within a year. I've had several kinds like this and they're useless. There is NO protective covering to the top of these CD-Rs. This is why you shouldn't buy them!Also, CD-Rs ARE built for durability, if you buy a disc with a good top and a good dye. Japanese Fuji CD-Rs and Azo-dyed Verbatims are two good examples of discs that not only are built for years, but even carry label guarantees for dozens of years of safe file archiving (see Maxell Pro's guarantee on the side of the package)These discs are terrible and made by Prodisc. If you value your data at all, do not purchase these CD-Rs."
4,Personal and literary biography,"Hingley does a good job of approaching Pasternak, particularly given that Pasternak was so chary of providing evidence of his personal life. The biography was well written, and certainly motivated me to keep reading.I knew a fair amount about Akhmatova and Tsvetayeva going in to reading this book and it felt like it filled in missing pieces of the same story. For me, the only unfortunate aspect was the nagging feeling that Hingley was somehow taking sides in the veracity of the various women in Pasternak's life. It added a weird gossipy kind of tone to some of the issues that were discussed.Still a commendable effort, and recommended if you are looking for a decent Pasternak biography."
4,Outstanding teachers of Torah on their own service of G-d,"This work consists in a series of interviews on the subject of ' Service of G-d.' Great Torah teachers of our generation present their own idea of what they see as the ideal service of God, and how they personally have strived to realize this.Among the interviewees are Rabbis Adin Steinsaltz, Yitz Greenberg, Berel Wein, Shlomo Aviner, Joshua Berman, Chaim Eisen,Emanuel Feldman, David Hartman, Mordechai Gafni,Israel Hess, Zev Leff,Nachum Amsel, and also Professors Israel Levine, Avi Ravitzky, Eliezer Schweid, and Phil Chernofsky, Miriam Adahan, Mimi Feigelson, Dr. Daniel Shalit, Dr. Gavriel Sivan.There is much real Torah in this work taught by devoted teachers."
3,Not as Interesting as I hoped,Had never seen the mini series so was excited to purchase it. Although you get interested in the main characters it becomes boring and I stopped after the 2nd series.
3,somewhat disappointing,"I must say I expected a lot more from this book. Although there are some clear analysis, all what has some interest could have perfectly summarized in 50 pages. It gives the wrong idea that a limited technology imposed sea routes in the Mediterranean till the advent of ""round ships"" from the North. However, the same routes so brilliantly described in the book are used today by any of the thousands of yachts sailing the Mediterranean, both motor and sail. And it should not take so easily for granted that small galleys and galliots could not withstand bad weather in some way. There is room for further research there."
3,"Geo, Tech, & War: The Mediterranean","This book is filled with intricate details about the geography and technology of Mediterranean ships up to the Renaissance - this makes for interesting reading if one is into this subject. For the historian, however, the book has less value in proportion to the amount of reading one needs to do."
5,This book was my salvation!!!,I have read many diet and exercise books but this author has captured a process and philosophy that was really easy to follow. And of course the most important thing is that his ideas worked for me. I lost a great deal of weight by following the exercise and diet suggestions.It is an easy book to follow but it has a heart too. There were parts of certain chapters that made me get teary. M.Sylvester is a wise man and is very much in touch with women and the issues of weight and body image. I hope he continues to write . I definately recommend this book.
5,Practical Guide To Weight Loss,The Author combines a very sensible exercise and diet plan in this book. Its format is such that it can be used as an easy reference guide. I know the author and believe that his experience working with women at the gym daily has enabled him to understand the difficulties women deal with in weight management.
3,Always something to learn,"While learn something new from any historical program from the History Channel, I was not crazy about the high speed switches in scene and the old film reel effects. I thought it distracted from the story. Of course, younger viewers will love it because it is machine-gun paced and they probably think the film really did skip and stutter along like that. A little gimmicky but worth seeing. I will use in the classroom as well. Be prepared--- more students than I thought watch History Channel--- a pleasant surprise for me!"
4,Entertaining but bias clouds its historic value,"I really liked the series but the over-the-top dramatisation of the Third Reich took away most of its historical value. It does make a very entertaining series. As one of many examples if you were to watch the series you would get the impression that only Germany invaded Poland. I had to watch the series several times with the idea that maybe I missed some reference, any reference that the Soviet Union also invaded Poland but no such luck. Again watch and enjoy but dont write a WWII paper on it.- J"
2,good film footage ruined,"There is some interesting film footage here, but it is ruined by over-the-top commentary that comes across like an (anti-) Nazi propaganda film, rather than true historical commentary. I'm no Nazi apologist, it was a terrible regime responsible for horrendous crimes, but this depiction is cartoonish - except for the film footage. Short on facts, long on hyperbole, and with some distracting cinematographic techniques that ruin what could have been an excellent summary of this period from a German perspective. History Channel has done some good bits, but this isn't one of them. Earns two stars because of the rare footage, but the presentation doesn't even rate one star."
5,A masterpiece !,"What a masterpiece of filmmaking! The three hours just flew by, I never enjoyed a documentary that much as this one .It's a very close second to World at War . My all time favourite documentary of World World 2."
4,Amazing history lesson,"After seeing this on the History Channel (or H2?), I thought it would be a good buy. Not disappointed. Much footage is the same as what is seen on ""World at War"", but this is concentrated on two disks. A good reminder of what Hitler did to a beautiful part of the world."
5,History Story of Evil ... Third Reich,"I found this dvd very good to watch and learn what would become The Third Reich of a mad man and what he could do to his own poeple and watch as it grew into the beast that would become a wild beast from hell,but will come into its end, as all wild mad beast do.Let mankind never let this happen again to any people of the world.God bless all who suffer and die under Third Reich."
2,Lousy - only worth for some otherwise unseen footage.,"Interesting videos but the narrative is insipid. It could be an interesting film if they are started over with an entirely different audio track. The announcer is slow, dramatic, and the interesting insights : words spoken ratio is very very low."
3,I OFFER CLASSES,ON WW II AND HAD PLANNED TO USE THIS IN MY PRESENTATIONS BUT THIS ONE DOES NOT TELL THE STORRY AS EFFECTIVELY AS OTHERS I HAVE IN MY LIBRARY.
2,Not Quite All Together,"This movie had the opportunity to present some rare footage to its audience. Instead, it presented the footage in all too short snippets that made one want to turn the thing off before it was running for 10 minutes.Quite frankly, the experience of watching it became irritating and I do not recommend it for those who enjoy good, quality documentaries. For this reason the movie just is not all together."
4,third reich,"another one I bought my dad he can watch them over and over again, since he was in europe in WWII."
4,Good buy,"Even though this is an older version of the famous lock, it works well. I purchased it because the cable exits the lock parallel to the laptop rather than perpendicular as do all current models. I'm using it to secure a digital photo frame in a retail environment. The cable is thick enough to serve as a bike lock, but at least you have peace of mind. You can't go wrong. Minus one star for the really thick cable, but for some this could be a plus rather than a minus."
2,marsh marigolds,"We planted the slips in our bog and they died. Minnesota marsh marigolds are hardier than Oregon marsh marigolds, because the two native plants we have are thriving."
2,Cheap Ripoff,"This video is nothing more than a copy of a PBS TV show. There are two TV showson this video. One on Drywall and another on Paneling. The TV show on Panelingis being sold under many different titles. Paneling, Paneling and Shelving, and Drywall and Paneling. They are the same tape just different titles. Each video is 30 minutes long except for the one titled Drywall and Panelling which is 1 hour bacause it at least has two shows on it. If you want to buy a tape then at least buy this one because it at least has two shows and more info on it."
4,Kooky game that succeeds despite being rough around edges,"I didn't like this game much when I first started playing it. A few levels in the varied gameplay and utter wackiness won me over. The game has alot of personality,weird characters,and fast action. Graphics wise it's very dated looking,and soundwise the music is good and the sound effects are really funny.A rough gem."
5,genuine and eccentric,"If you're looking for just the greatest hits, i.e. the most popular Tull songs on Classic Rock radio, you wouldn't go for this one first. But the acoustic side of Tull is an essential part of the Tull canon, and this collection represents an idea that has been decades overdue. The acoustic format allows for a combination of genuine expressiveness and Tull's patented eccentric creativity. That said, some of these great acoustic pieces are latter-day re-workings, and they tend to be inferior to the originals, interesting primarily to collectors. But many of these songs are the original tracks, beautifully remastered. So there's a lot here for the afficionados, and it's not a bad place to start for the curious."
3,Hoping for more,"When I heard that Jethro Tull was coming out with an all acoustic CD, I could hardly wait. I was hoping for a nice flow of some re-mixed and/or updated acoustic material. But alas, the quality is as if the songs were taken right off the ""older"" albums and put directly on the CD. It's nice to have a lot of my favorites on one CD, but I just can't get past the fact that I was ""hoping for more crispness"" in the guitar strings."
5,Powerful for outdoor cooking,"I bought this wok last year because my kitchen was being remodeled. I was amazed with the power of this burner. I used it to cook Fried Rice, Saute Veggies, and Cook noodles for lots of people. Even a professional cook can definitely use this burner."
3,Eastman Outdoors Model 37212 22-Inch Carbon-Steel Wok Kit,The cooker is well made but the accessories are very cheap especially the wok. Look like the accessories are cheap China made (both quality and appearance). The work is rusted and multiple dent (very thin wok).I would love if they sell the cooker separately.
3,"SW Last of the Jedi, Book 5...","Pretty good SW EU series. Although it's a Scholastic book writtn with kids in minds, it's an easy read that puts you in the SW universe.I'm looking forward to Book 6."
4,Big Babies gets big laughs.,"While searching the bookstore shelves for another book I wanted, I literally bumped into ""Big Babies"" by Sherwood Kiraly and boy, am I glad I did! I was in need of a light comedy and this book delivered like nothing I've ever read before. On the first page you'll smile and by the middle of the book you'll be tearing up from laughter because of the main character's quirky view of life and zany encounters. The book is absolutely loveable and the only thing I found wrong with it is that it had to end."
3,Doesn't really work,"Very little of the mineral build up adheres to the pad. It seems it must float above the heating element, because 90% of build up occurs on the heating element with another 8 percent building up on the plastic surrounding the heating element."
3,Not sure,"I've been trying to figure out exactly what these are doing for over two weeks and perhaps I will someday. My humidifier manual says the humidifier can run without them but I will have to clean the unit more frequently. Since the water where I live is very hard, I have to clean the unit twice a week anyway. So I've run the unit without them and I can't tell much of a difference.Incidentally, the pads do pick up something since they get hard and chalky as they dry after being in the humidifier for just a few days. I'm not sure if they're supposed to get hard as rock but if I left the pad in for a week (the recommendation), I think they would.It's still a mystery."
3,Does NOT fit Vicks V790 Humidifier,"Though Amazon places these pads on the same page as the Vicks V790 Warm Mist Humidifier, these HMP-12P Mineral Absorption Pads are too large for this model. I didn't really want to rate these since I was unable to use them."
2,not necessary to change filter as often as they say,"You're better off just washing and re-using the mineral pad until it is really spent, or using distilled water in the tank (if you are willing to buy the water)."
3,it works,"I use it in the Vicks machine. You have to cut them, but that's easy enough. They do the job."
3,warm mist humidifier,"Very compact unit,competitive pricing, relatively quiet and fast operation. 4 gallon capacity reduces frequency of refilling. Simple touch controls for adjusting humidistat (digital read-out), duration of operation, and rate of humidity output are very useful features. Unfortunately, after about 2 weeks of intermittent use, the humidistat control malfunctioned. I contacted the manufacturer and was pleased to know that repair/replacement would not be a problem (under warranty). I have experienced no other problems with this unit. Proper maintenance is required for normal operation. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a quiet, effective and reasonably priced humidifier."
1,Mineral absorption,I cannot make any comment since I have not used it yet. I do not know how or where to attach it.
1,You probably don't need it,I bought these for the Honeywell Humidifer I bought but the unit is so easy to clean I don't think I need-plus the directions I got said to put it under the heating coil and I didn't want to do that for fear it would heat up (???) if the unit ran dry and maybe become harmful.
2,Does not fit Vicks humidifier,"This product was recomended to buy with my vicks humidifier, but they do not fit. Each one has to be trimmed to fit..."
1,not suitable for the vicks device,"when I purchased the vicks humidifier, Amazon offered this as the pad for the humidifier. bought it together but it DOESN'T FIT!!!! don't be tempted, just buy the pads separately."
3,Not sure,I have ran the unit with and without the mineral pad and can honestly say that I am not sure the pads are worthwhile. The unit seemed to get dirty in the same amount of time.
3,Absorption pad,"These are good quality pads, but this size is the wrong size for the unit--yet they were the recommended ones for the vaporizer."
2,Doesn't fit,This needs to be trimmed to fit as others have stated. Not sure if I would recomment this to purchase or not due to the extra hassle
3,Nice,It is what it says.. Got here fast. Not sure if it will work with my humidifier though. That's my fault.
3,I ordered the incorrect pad for my Vicks UV germ free humidifer,"Pad is too large for my Vicks UV germ free humidifer. I ordered the incorrect pad for my unit.If I had a Honeywell humidifier, I believe these pads would work well."
2,Review on size not function,"These were sold as filters for the Vick's humidifier. They're probably fine in function...but they're too large....irritating that one has to cut to size when, in fact, the correct size (in reading other reviews...too late!) does exist."
3,It sticks to the inside.,This does its job. It filters. But it sticks to the inside of the humidifier so you have to peel it out if it gets dry.
4,Honeywell absorption pad,"What can you say, you have to have to have these in order for the humidifier to operate."
4,Mineral Absorption Pads,These worked just fine except they were a size too big for my humidifier. I just cut the edge off and used them anyway.
1,wrong size,"these are marketed as replacement filters for a vicks model but these are too big for it. these measure 3 1/4"" when the vicks model requires a 2 1/4 filter. i am not trying to skew product ratings, merely trying to warn those considering this product."
3,disappointed,"the filter works well enough, but seems to need be replaced more often than what the company states."
2,wrong size for v790,"I typed in Vicks v790 pads and this was one of a couple of choices which came up. They seemed cheapest so I ordered them. HOWEVER, they are 3 1/4 inches wide and much thicker than the original Vicks pads which are 2 1/4 inches. I will probably cut them down to fit since it's not worth the trouble to return. Or maybe I'll just try the overnight vinegar soak on the original used ones, a trick which has been recommeneded by a number of reviewers.NB: These are TOO BIG for Vicks warm steam humidifier with the double tank, model V790. Obviously they are for a Honeywell unit which takes a larger pad."
3,ok,Having to deal with this chalk is a hassle. These pads are a alternative to the original (expensive) one. They are sort of working.
4,A Gentle Detox,"Unlike most ""detox"" products this tea is gentle, not harsh on the system. The taste is pleasant so having a cup is just that, enjoying a cup of tea, not taking your medicine. I recommend it to those looking for a simple way to support the digestive system."
5,Philips clock radio,This is the best alarm clock/radio i have ever owned set it once and it's all good wake up to an alarm or the radio this one is a keeper and the price is perfect for the quality.
3,"Good printing, shoddy sewing","The hem on our towel hasn't lasted well, and now the towel is fraying after just six months of occassional use. Pity, our daughter loves the design."
4,Good resource for Cheraw genealogists,"This book is simply a compilation of the church records of St. David's parish and has been useful for me in my genealogy research related to the town of Cheraw. The index is properly done, and it is easy to search for specific individuals."
5,Good candy,"This is a candy bar that is not available in stores in our area, but my son enjoys it when he goes to canp. So I ordered this for his Secret Santa gift and he still does not know who is his secret Santa.A candy bar that is delicious"
2,Disappointment,"As a strategy fan, I can generally accept a clunky interface and sub-standard graphics, but in this case they've ruined the game for me. Laying track/roads is very cumbersome and maddening. Routing is no picnic either.There is probably great gameplay buried in the game but the poor graphics and construction hassles will prevent me from ever finding it. It is a shame that Chris Sawyer chose to use an outdated game engine for this effort - the door is still wide open for a competitor to create a strong transportation simulation.I strongly recommend downloading the demo before purchase. Not doing so cost me $25."
2,Probably his last work,"Locomotion is a game that is designed to accomadate the rare patient people who enjoy to watch and imagine train glory. I played the demo, and from that it seemed to be a jungled mess of trains and other stuff go this and that way, too advanced controls, and he seemed money hungry for this one,(his insanely short demo...). I had little hope for this game, and I was right, now no longer available in stores across the US,(not even in thriftstores). His game is on atari, there will probably not even be another rct. He got rich, and that's it, after the failure of this game he got discouraged and quit, not a good game."
3,Good When It Works,"I became addicted to Locomotion, with a few reservations. But it suddenly stopped working (Problem with Loco.exe, contact Microsoft). Bought a second, after installation had problems then stopped working. Tech support has no idea about the cause. I wonder how many buyers have this problem (which showed up after MS-XP upgrade was installed)? It seems to be a rental program, works for a while then needs a new copy. Save your money."
2,Very Derivative,"This game offers almost nothing beyond what ""Transport Tycoon"" had. There are no VR effects, few changes to the economic engine, and it's buggy as heck.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,A real disapointment,"I bought this game based on Chris Sawyers reputation and my enjoyment of games of this type, but when I installed it I was stunned. This game uses the exact same graphics engine as Rollercoaster Tycoon 1! A lot of people didn't like the fact that Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 used the same graphics as the first one, but here we are years later in a totally different game and it's still the same. The interface worked well for Rollercoaster Tycoon, but I didn't find conducive to this game at all. This game could have taken a lot of pointers from Railroad Tycoon 3. Chris Sawyer makes good games, but he really needs to modernize his efforts."
1,bad movie...,The only reason you'd wanna buy this movie is to see Maria Ford in softcore Scenes...I hate this movie because there are no MariaFord softcore scenes in this movie rather than some lousy dances...
1,linnea quigley,If your thinking of buying this movie because your a linnea quigley fan.dont because she appears for only about three seconds and only has one line.Plus this movie is boring and no plot no nothing and just a waste of money.Sadly i got pulled in because of linnea.Do not buy this movie.
5,Best DVD I think I own!,"I can't say enought about the DVD. As an avid Queen fan, and even from others viewpoint - it is a VERY entertaining video. I didn't know all of these songs. It was like Queen came back. I love every song on it too."
5,The Queen Collection...to be continued,"I must say that I was a bit dismayed to find no videos to their Innuendo CD. I suppose that they will include all of those videos on another upcoming, yet to be released, year away, Queen: Video Hits 3.But, there is a lot of stuff on here besides the videos that warrant a five star rating from me.On disc two they have very ultra rare videos from the Hot Space CD also in DTS 5.1, and a rare concert performance of ""Staying Power"" from 1982.Interviews from three of the four album periods here. Making of videos, hidden Easter Egg, and commentary for everything!I guess I should trust Queen to do it right with the order and contents of their releases. It's most likely better this way."
3,Queen - Greatest Video Hits 2 - set of 2 DVDs,There were 2 numbers on each DVD which were unviewable. The ones I could view were fine but as a whole they were incomplete.
4,I think a volume III needs to be made,Good videos. Volume one and two did miss some of Queen's other popular songs though. Maybe the makers should consider this and make a volume three to cover the other good videos that got missed by these first two volumes.
3,shipping was more than the cost of the item,I bought this as a gift for someone who loves Taz and I kept it but beware the shipping on this item is ridiculous.
5,Sugoi,"Excellent music. American music is simply not allowed to be this upbeat. Beautiful voices and wonderfully harmonized singing is like the trademark of Folder 5. If you love Jpop, this is definetly a must-have. Also, this is a very good study aid to help learn Japanese the way it is really spoken. Lots of my Japanese friends are big fans as well."
1,A VERY BAD RE-RECORDINGS...,"Vaya porquería. Los éxitos de Amanda están remezclados sin ningún tipo de gusto, como si ella fuera una artista de tercara categoría. Una producción musical muy mala que no está a la altura de los arreglos originales. No entiendo ni cómo ella misma consintió regrabar las canciones de los 70. Los arreglos y las mezclas de pésimo gusto, y el artwork también. Al menos han incluido los LPs ""Alter ego"" y ""Secret passion"" sin volver a grabarlos y los puedes tener en CD."
2,It's no mystery--this really stinks!,"I have to be the voice reason here. These are indeed re-recordings, just as one reviewer points out. However, the quality of these tracks is simply atrocious! The use of such cheap sounding instrumental backing is really the downfall here, not so much Lear's aging and thinning voice (although she is not an innocent bystander here, either). Technology has afforded us much better keyboard and beat quality over the years, but there's no evidence of that here. Plus, there are no liner notes at all and track annotaions are bare minimum (timing, writers, publishing). This is definitely not the place to begin if you are thinking of investigating the mystery of Amanda Lear. This is merely an embarrassingly incriminating footnote in the case file!"
1,Transsexual Or Not?,"Amanda Lear was once a man, right? Noone seems to mention this..... From what I understand he had a sex change back when it was kinda unheard of. If I'm wrong.... may I be forced to spend the rest of my days listening to remixes of remixes of Ms. Lear."
2,Handbook?,"I found this book to be mostly common sense. I didn't find anything in it that was revelation, or handbook worthy."
2,Kind of a Pain,"I bought this for my husband along with a puzzle, thinking it would be the perfect answer to having the puzzle left on my dining room table until it was finished. Not a good solution. The mat was hard to work with and the puzzle didn't seem to stay together. In the end, my dining room table won out. I was really disappointed."
3,it should have been better,"ok, at last a proper collection of sid vicious ""work"". the singles are of course excellent, the out takes interesting, the sample of interviews cool, but the live tracks are as usual poor. nothing new. if you like sid and the pistols you have heard it all before. i was disapointed because i hoped that with modern technology the sound of the livetracks should have been better. it still sounds like a poor bootleg. but sid is sid, if you like it you like it. if not, buy something else."
3,"Would be 5 except for the ""eyes"".","This novel is a would-be great one, spoiled throughout by the author's total fixation on eyes and eye color! Literally, every few sentences, she refers to ""her beautiful emerald eyes""; ""his sapphire eyes""; ""her sparkling emerald eyes""; and on, and on, and ON! I would have loved this book if not for this wording tearing away at my nerves. For each response, statement or emotion, she refers to the color of the character's eyes! I found myself rolling my own brown eyes so much I had to put it down. Otherwise, this would be have been a great read."
3,Confusion of Nomenclature,"This is a handy book, very easy to use, with good coverage of the more commonly viewed organisms. BUT... the book uses ""Brachiopod"" (marine animals that have hard ""valves"" (shells) on the upper and lower surfaces) where it should be ""Branchiopod"" (a class of crustacean). This error is found on 219 - 224."
2,"They work fine, but fit and finish are lacking","These are priced in between Craftsman and Snap-On. I thought they would be a good compromise. The casting and machine work are very rough on the inside. On some of them, if you put your finger in there it could cut you. The work fine, but if I had to do it over again I'd go with Craftsman...Snap-On if I was feeling rich."
5,The book that played a huge role in my childhood...,"I recently took a college Astronomy class and was amazed how much of the information I already knew from reading Our Universe when I was very young. Our Universe absolutely captivated me as a child. I used to read this book nearly every day. I was in love with all of the beautiful pictures and it is incredibly educational. Although it is outdated, there is a great amount of correct information. This is definitely a must have for every child. I don't believe I would appreciate astronomy so much if I had never had exposure to this book. Everyone should have Our Universe in their book collections, especially every child who is fascinated by astronomy.I hope you all love it as much as I did. :)"
1,Seat lid does not stay on!,"My fiancee and I are smart people and have built things around the home-but this took us several hours over two nights. The screw holes are not aligned to the holes on the seat. You need to drill new holes. But that's not the worst part! There is nothing to hold the end caps in place-lift the lid and off comes the lid in your hand. It's a dumb design. After messing up the toliet seat drilling holes, we ended up throwing the whole kit and kaboodle in the trash and getting a new toliet seat with metal already attached. Waaaay too much frustration-over a toliet seat! It deserves no stars at all! Thumbs down!"
4,Fun but hard to play,"This game is fun to play once in a while, but it is not a game to play casually. It takes a lot of focus, and new players have some difficulty learning the concepts."
2,"Shoddy workmanship, poor customer service","Yes, I was stupid enough to shell out the money for this litter pan cover, as I couldn't find anything comparable and I wanted something decorative to cover the litter pan. While this product looks nice enough, I've had two problems with it: 1) the first time I ordered this thing, the Herzher company sent the wrong color, and since I live in a NYC apartment building with no doorman (and no car, and my office is two crowded subway trains away), returning items thru the mail is a pain in the neck; 2) the second one I purchased was the correct color but the latch on the front panel was defective from the moment I opened the package -- so the front doesn't stay closed (the spring in the latch doesn't ""spring"") and my cat scared himself silly when he tried to enter and the door flopped open and clattered to the floor. Considering the price of this item, that kind of shoddiness is inexcusable. I would never buy anything from Herzher again."
1,very disappointed and annoyed I wasted my money,"If the review would allow (0) zero stars that would be my selection.I thought when it said large decorative it would cover the litter box with ease. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The litter box is a very snug fit inside the cover. Once my cats are inside covering their bodily functions as cats do the door flops open which then rattles my cats. I have had to tie the door at the top to keep it from opening.This is not what I had in mind for the price of this product or what I was led to believe its purpose would be.I would not make this purchase again nor would I recommend it to anyone.For the same price you can purchase a free standing folding door and serve the same purpose without frightening your cat."
3,Color is weird and latch is weak,"Beware this item is NOT a natural wicker or rattan color. It looks like a butter yellow. I also have problems with the latch on the door. It does latch but only when I push it HARD and after several tries. I hope it continues to work. Yes, extremely overpriced."
2,Poorly designed,"This product looks very nice, as advertised, but it's poorly designed and constructed. The latch on the front panel is not strong enough to keep the panel closed, so the minute my cat walks thru the entrance, the door flops open and scares him silly (so he's not inclined to go in there again, and I'm left with a gaping litter box -- just the problem this item was supposed to resolve). Thinking that perhaps I'd received a defective front panel, I actually got a replacement panel from the company, but the latch on the new one is just as bad. It's just poorly designed and needs to be rethought and reconstructed. Considering that this thing is way overpriced to begin with, it's especially galling. NOT recommended."
4,Bonco Kitties,"I bought this product to keep kittens from getting kitty litter every where and to have it out of sight,That it does to a extent.But if you want it for keeping the smell down it only does it partly.It does look nice with my wicker furniture I have,that too is why I bought it.You should try this product. It's really sturdy holds up to 3 kittens,Still going strong. I really like this product."
4,Cat Box Cover,"I was very pleased with my purchase of the litter box cover. It is very sturdy, looks to be wasable, and really hides the litter box. My cats, being used to a covered litter pan, were not apprehensive about using it.My only negative comment is that it is rather large (which allows for a ""big"" litter box) but this can limit where it can be used.All in all it was a good purchase."
2,Poor construction,"I was disappointed with this product and returned it within a few days. The frame was not a tight construction and the clasp that holds the front opening in place, which is necessary for the emptying of the tray, was loose. The result was that if the cat brushed up against it on entering, it fall open - either behind him or on him. Having had this happen several times, the cat soon learned to avoid this trauma and thus it defeated the object of the exercise."
4,Litter Pan Cover,"I needed a dog deterrant. I looked at many types of covers, read the reviews and decided to try this tasteful wicker cover. It's nice looking, light yet study enough to hold a laundry basket. The cats use it w/o any problems, the pan fits well, (I even have room for the scoop) and the door stays closed. I do think the price is a bit high, but it's so nice to keep the dog out and have a nice looking covered litter pan, I'm willing to pay a bit more. I think it's great!"
3,Not impressed,Had some issues getting the product. Faded with first wash and sheets shrank. Total bummer.
4,Trip wire,"The trip wire is pretty good but it is very hard to set up three of them, and to take a little while to but when it is ready it is pretty fun. The spry does not make the trip wire beam invisible."
2,its ok,its ok if you like hard to setup stuff and sometimes it doesnt go off so i would not recemend it
3,"Spy ""Laser Alam""","I bought this and tried to set it up in my room. It has to clip on to something to stay stable, but the areas you clip it to almost have to be exactly parallel to each other to work. After i set it up, i had a problem trying to get it to arm the alarm. You have to set it up perfectly and it sometimes can take a few minutes. It looks VERY obvious and sticks out horribly. And after all the prep for it, it can be fooled by shining a laser pointer into the receiving unit and walking through the beam projected by the projecting unit. Overall this is too complicated to set up quickly and doesn't work properly."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This toy is a complete fraud. I got it for one of my birthdays. So, I tried to set it up in my room, but it was impossible!!!!!! To set it up, you hafta put them in your desired place. BUT...... To complete the laser, you hafta make sure the laser emitting from one of them end EXACTLY in the millimeter-sized hole. If you're scanning the toy stores for 'dis thing, DON'T GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! Unless you want to be INCREDIBLY frustrated by this stupid thing!!"
1,THIS STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The Worst Toy Ever! Do not buy. My brother and I put them one inch away from each other and they did not work. The spray bottle was just water and you could not see the laser. If you buy it after reading this you are CRAZY!
4,The Color of Madness,"I have never read anything like this story. It takes a while to get used to his style of writing, but by the time it is over you don't want it to end. This story is crazy and it never slows down, but it is a hell of a lot of fun. It is filled with dry, witty British humor, and the characters are vivid and lively. These 2 stories(The Color of Magic, and The Light Fantastic)should definitely be read together, and that is why I give this publication my review and recommendations."
4,Swiss Gold Room Conditioner,"Item works well. Heat is not as intense as I expected (perhaps the room is too large); but it does get the job done given time. Have not had a chance to see how it works in the summer for cooling. Overall, I am pleased."
5,Math IS beautiful!,"The reviews of this book vary as to the level of its difficulty. I am sure that I will not understand much of the mathematics. However, this thought alone, which I just read in the Preface, to me is worth the price of the book.Page, xviii ""The idea of a fraction such as 3/8 is simply that it is some kind of an entity which has the property that, when added to itself 8 times in all, gives 3.""This gives me a hint of the beauty of mathematics. For that I feel I have already received my money's worth."
3,"Is mathematics ""real""?","This is a work of mathematics, not physics. If math is your interest -what mathematical approaches are currently being used in theoretical physics- then you should enjoy this book. However,Penrose, to my personal disapointment, does a poor job of corelating math with cosmology. I gained no greater insight into the ""whys"" and ""wherefors"" of the universe than I already had."
4,too much math????,"well what i can say ,the book is exelent if you have a good level of graduate mathematics ,of course the publisher advertise the book as a book for anybody, well you have to open the pages and judge for yourself,i do recomend the book for a math major or any one taking a class in math phisics.I did enjoy the book all the way"
5,The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe,"This is a book over one 1000 pages! My daughter asked me: Is the road to reality indeed so long? We both laught...and after a while I braged about it: With Roger Penrose help, the 1000 pages road to reality may be the shortest! However, I found out later on, that it may indeed be the shortest, but only if you have your own five stars shining above you..."
3,Excellence,"This is basically an extremely good mathematics book so I am rating it with three stars. However most of the mathematics I want on making actual physics calculations using general relativity, quantum mechanics, and quantum field theory simply aren't included. The author has a taste for investigating at depth the type of useless mathematical speculations which lead nowhere, permit no calculations, and are basically drivel. Despite this, it is easy to ignore/remove chapters which are unhelpful, and then the book becomes a readable and portable joy for everyone."
5,Loved it.,Its about time someone wrote physics without dumming down the text with no references to the mathematics needed for a complete understanding. I loved this book. It made me brush up on my college mathematics and even take calculus. I strongly recommend it. For all who search for the truth this is one important tome.
1,Too Advanced for Target Audience,"This book is being presented by its publisher as a layman's guide. It is not. I would judge it to be at least at the college graduate level. As far as the actual content, I would classify it as a cataloging of ideas without insight or point. I never felt like I was drawn into a discussion that was going anywhere."
5,Awesome,"""Magellan"", in another review, mentions a Linus Pauling book. When I was only seven years old, I discovered that book in a shell: a legacy from my uncle Ramon, a Cuban refugee who was forced to leave his country and enter the United States because of his political ideas. That book was an incentive for becoming who I'm now. So I can figure, in the near future, a used copy of ""The Road to Reality"" in the hands of an amazed little boy or girl, and all the things he or she could do with all this concentrated knowledge... and wisdom. Thanks, Mr. Penrose."
4,"great, though you need to know math well","This is a very nice, if math filled, description of Quantum Mechanics. It discusses all of the major issues, in considerable detail. It took me a long time to digest, however I found it useful."
4,"Review of ""The Road to Reality""","It is too early yet. The book is huge and I have just covered a few pages,but it looks very promising."
3,DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ROAD,"TOO MUCH SPACE DEVOTED TO TWISTOR THEORY AND MATH FUNDAMENTALS, WHILE NOT ENOUGH ON M-THEORY, BRANE THEORY ANDTHE RANDALL-SUNDRUM SCENARIO, RADION FIELDS,ETC....LITERALLY HEAVY. ONE WOULD NOT LEARN THE MATH PRESENTED WITHOUT ALREADY BEING FAMILIAR WITH IT."
1,Penrose Road is a Dead End,"The road to reality is not found in this book. Penrose doesn't explain what reality is, not even mathematically. The book is a failure. The road to reality begins with one simple question: why am I on this road? Penrose Road seeks to lead us to the so-called ultimate equation that will unify the seemingly conflicting theories of modern physics. Once this equation is found, however, the question will still remain unanswered, namely, why is this equation at the end of the road?"
3,Old ideas of historical value,"Penrose considers the big bang and uses mathematics, which does not correspond to the nature of reality. There are deep problems with the big bang theory discussed in July 02 issue of New Scientist, reporting The First Crisis In Cosmology Conference - Moncao, Portugal, 23-25 June. One looking for the structure of reality can read Savov's Theory of Interaction the Simplest Explanation of Everything. Reality has self-similarly evolving structure. Its depth cannot be followed in the modern mathematical constructions, according to Eugene Savov, member of the organizing committee of this conference. Penrose's book left me with more confusion than new insights. It makes a good read for purely mathematically inclined. His ideas are far way from recent observations, which burst the foundations of big bang theory."
1,Quickly loses steam.,"This book starts out as if it were aimed at the lay person and even makes efforts to explain points that require no introduction to a college graduate with a degree in math or science. (Example: the author rhetorically asks how one can have a square root of a negative number.) And yet, less than one-fifth of the way into the book, he proceeds from assuming you don't know what a complex number is to requiring understanding of Riemannian geometry. The author attempts to provide more than mere nonmathematical philosophizing as some slimmer books have done, but the failure is that his presentation quickly outstrips understanding. This brings us back full circle to accepting on faith what the undoubtedly brilliant author has to say, but now in the form of a tedious, 1000+ page tome."
5,The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe,I am totally excited reading this book. A must have if you are a non-specialist and wanting to learn.
2,Too much of commitment,"This book requires a great commitment from the reader. I have a B.S. degree in physics and I found parts of it confusing. I should think that you would want to have recently studied calculus & complex analysis. The hard work required does not lead to a great reward. Penrose's Twistor theory has been around and dismissed for a decade or more. Combining this book with The Emperors New Mind and I start to get the idea that Penrose is kind of a crack pot.This book is very difficult to follow and does not lead one to the road to reality, only a little madcap corner of it."
4,Like Making Your Mind Run the Boston Marathon,"This is a challenging book, even for self-described intellectuals. It's critical to put in the time, slowly, in the first few chapters, stick with it, and see the benefits unfold in the later, rather elegant chapters where it all comes together -- literally. While Penrose can be a bit strident at times, he makes a convincing and worthwhile case for his explanation of how the laws of nature interrelate and flow into somewhat very unexpected fields. Not having read many (any) other books on theoretical physics, it's hard to compare this to other books in the genre. But from a more philosophical viewpoint, it's an impressive effort to expound on current theory and can make even a hardened 19th century Western European old-school philosophy curmudgeon like myself to take pause and think things over. Well worth the time and effort."
2,No free lunch,"I was trained as a mathematical economist, and Mr. Penrose's book confirms the dismal science's old adage ""There is no free lunch"".One cannot teach the whole of mathematical physics to the layman in 350 pages or so - what utter madness!A shame, because I really liked his ""The Emperor's New Mind"", esp. his exposé of Gödel's incompleteness theorem and Bell's Inequality Principle (even though linking consciousness with quantum physics is one of his crackpot ideas).A popular book? In terms of sales figures perhaps, but surely not in terms of the number of people actually having read the book."
