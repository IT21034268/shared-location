1,Should be 1/2 a star...,"Let me preface this by saying that I am glad I only rented this. I'm only out 3.95.As much as I tried, I could not bring myself to like this movie.It tried to be a game of cat-and-mouse. It tried to be full of suspense. It failed on both counts. The acting...atrocious. Though Keanu may not be the best actor on earth, at least he tries. Not here. I remember reading somewhere that he only did it so that he would not get sued. Feels like it. James Spader...well. Marisa Tomei...no comment.An all-around horrendous movie. Recommended only for the masochistic among us."
1,"I was disappointed,,,.","First,I want to say that what is the point in this movie?I could not understand this movie's point.This movie left me nothing.I do not say that actor and actress are bad, but the concept of the movie is poor.Thank you."
2,Whoa!,"I started watching this film and thought ok. This is shaping up to be an ok Thriller. Then the director said "" LET'S BLOW THINGS UP. FORGET PLOT, ACTING AND SUSPENSE. THE AUDIENCE IS TOO STUPID TO NOTICE THESE THINGS ANYWAY. JUST GIVE THEM EXPLOSIONS!""Very sad. It could have been so much more, it looked to be so much more and then it just lost the plot. It was quite gripping until the explosions started. The ending is poor and lacks suspense, but it does have some big explosions. Maybe one day they will do some Thrillers with some real bite and edge to them. Give it a miss."
3,Quite okay,"FBI-Agent Campbell (James Spader) is obviously missed by a serial-killer (Keanu Reeves), who follows him from L.A. to Chicago to continue to play a deadly cat-and-mouse game with him. The killer manages to kill two more women, but when he kidnaps Campbell's psychiatrist Polly (Marisa Tomei) he gets into big trouble.""The Watcher"" by Joe Charbanic is a quite good thriller with parallels from ""Seven"" and ""The Bone Collector"" (both are better though). The use of some camcorder pictures and video-clip editing adds some speed and atmosphere to the movie, but these things don't make the weak end better. Nevertheless ""The Watcher"" is worth a watch."
4,the watcher,"this movie is a good movie, I have no idea why people didn't like it but I dont agre with them. It dosnt have a lot of action in it but it isnt an action movie it is a thriller and it is a good one."
2,this movie belongs on t.v. - not the big screen,"I'm glad I waited to rent this movie instead of going to the theatre. This movie was slow, too slow. The story line was ok, but not enough to keep you in suspense. This movie belongs on t.v.- not the big screen.."
3,"Ok,but not the best","Let me start this off by saying,Keanu Reeves is not good as a serial killer.He wasn't scary at all.He was way too friendly.I kept expecting him to say""Hey,how are you doing?I'm gonna kill you"".Now I think he is a pretty good actor,but not in this movie. The plot was ok.There were a few scenes I didn't really like and should have been left on the cutting room floor.The main problem was,there was no character development at all.Ok,so all in all,rent this if there is absolutly nothing else to rent.This is one of those movies you see when nothing else is there."
3,visually stunning,"As a visual experience this film is well shot and features all the latest camaera trickery.But as an example of modern cinema it owes a lot to Fight Club and similar movies .Unfortunately Keanu Reeves is no Brad Pitt.An interesting change of role but he fails to convince as a serial killer ending up seeming to be bored rather than threatening,shame!"
1,"I asked myself ""Why""..","Ok the beggining of the movie was promising with the modern rock sound and Keanu in Matrix-like look (more fat though)..But after that in 10 minutes or so I discovered that there was no plot..Keanu was the watcher,though he never watched just killed girls..But the biggest question occupying my mind was ""Why is he killing them?"".The most simple answer would be because he is a psycho but he didn't show any emotions while killing,barring the possibility that this was what he was enjoying..Or maybe because he liked playing games with Spader's character,but then why he started to kill in the first place.At the end of the movie,we know as much about Keanu's character as at the beginning...nothing. This was really a stupid movie and mark my words because I am a person that usually tries to find something good in action movies that most people find stupid.In this one,I found nothing.The package was good but inside was empty..."
2,"Good for kids, but otherwise it's kind of boring","The only reason I gave this book two stars is because it's really meant for kids younger than myself, so I probably can't rate it accurately. For one thing, it's way to short! I can literaly read it in fifteen minutes, and all the best parts of the movie are left out. The writing is also undiscriptive, boring, and it doesn't show the character developement that was in the movie. Even when I first read this book at ten years old I thought it wasn't that good, but now truthfully the only interesting part is the pictures from the movie stuck in the middle. Younger kids eleven and under, for whom this book is intended for, might not mind this, and it is a good start for young readers who want to get into reading Star Wars, but older fans probably won't like it."
2,Not Scotchlite...,"For some reason when you search for ""black scotchlite"" whether by google or on Amazon you get taken to this item. As others have said, there is no mention of it's reflective properties on the packaging or marketing -- this is no accident. The product may be many things but I wouldn't consider it at all reflective. For those seeking a decal, it's probably worth 3 or 4 stars, for those seeking reflectivity I give it no stars."
1,Wasted,"Several hours of my life and $20 were wasted on this book. McNiff did not dedicate much to the writing of this book, so I'll dedicate little to the review. In a nutshell:- poorly executed- scattered writings- uncollected thoughts- McNiff! Familiarize yourself with a spellcheck application.- fragmented/run-on sentence structure- non-edited book; not even a proofreader was involvedThat this book exists is testiment to the fact that small and self-publishing companies care nothing about literature and only about their bottom line.To anyone contemplating this book, I'm sure you could find a much better use for your money, say, lining the bottom of a birdcage."
3,Cute but a little too smelly,It is a cute gift but an actual cologne is too smelly for the sensitive noses...
3,"Okay, but...","Well, I bought this boot because it was advertised as being ""airport-friendly"". This one in particular is not, it has a steel shank. The boot itself is comfortable and useable, I use it for riding motorcycles. No it does not have steel toe. I needed a boot for my commute to work, and I found another alternative where I need a non-metallic boot. This one is for non-work days then."
3,"Cursi, pero divertida","Cuenta, más o menos, la historia del Cid, pero sin las largas y aburridísimas descripciones de batallas y cenas. No diría que es fiel al texto original, pero para los niños es algo divertido."
1,zero stars,The quality of this dvd product is so poor that you wonder how it could have been produced. It's a shame that people exploit great cinema in this way.
1,Product Description Error,"The Product Description for the ""Gold of Naples/Bicycle Thief"" disk indicates English subtitles. But there are no subtitles, because the films are dubbed in English. So if you want these classic films in their original Italian language versions, this combo DVD isn't for you."
3,A Forgotten Classic,"Author Richard McKenna did not live too many years after the stunning success of his first novel, ""The Sand Pebbles"". This book, based on real events in 1920s China, inspired the superb, award-winning 1966 Robert Wise-directed film of the same title, starring Steve McQueen. The novel provides much character background and place details not in the movie, for obvious reasons. So, if you love to see the movie and then read the book (or vice versa), this is a classic for your summer reading list. Long out of print, you can still find modest priced reading copies. Most public libraries no longer have the book which will make it a collectible in coming years."
3,Good possibly for naval history buffs,"I thought it was a very slow read. Liked the movie better, since Steve McQueen was always interesting to watch. Where are actors with charisma today? After Denzel, can't think of many."
4,The sand pebble rocks,"Interesting, clear, good read about China's start to modernism withit's rejection of Western influence after The Boxer Rebellion and it'srejection of Western power's trading ports."
3,"Good, but the film is better","For much of its length this is a boiler-plated read: raw, authentic, densely textured and richly characterized. But I think the story starts to wander halfway in and further becomes bogged down with too many characters and a little too much technical (i.e. engine) detail. These are flaws I don't remember from the McQueen film, which has to be considered a very intelligent adaptation. So don't expect something quite as satisfying as that."
2,Too Many Typos!!!!,"I'm only referring to the structure of the e-book rather than the story itself. The story is very good and I enjoyed it very much. However, this e-book was ridden with typos. It looked as if some junior high school kid typed it out. Ok, the book was only $3.99, but I would have rather paid $9.99 for it and had it formatted in a professional manner. Sadly, I would recommend that you purchase this in a book form rather than an e-book."
3,"Quick read, exciting, but stretches credulity after awhile.","Papillon is the roughest, toughest, rootenist, tootenist, best lover, and most fair, prisoner ever. And these are his adventures trying to escape from prison.At a certain point, the book had all the believability of a Penthouse forum letter."
4,Redemption,"An unbelievable story of adventure and redemption. Henri called Papillon or Papi by his friends is sentenced to life imprisonment and makes it his goal to escape. He escapes once and winds up with a native tribe where he lives for almost a year. He leaves still bent on revenge against the people who wrongly imprisoned him. Leaving behind 2 pregnant wives and a new family of friends he tries to make his way back to France, but is captured and sent back to prison where he spends 8 years trying to escape again. Although he keeps trying to escape he wants to do it with as little impact on the other prisoners or the guards and wardens. He finally gives up his idea of revenge and decides to move forward and just live.I had a hard time remembering that this was true story and not fiction."
5,Riveting Read,"Papillon is the true story of Henri Charrière's escape from a supposedly escape-proof penal colony on Devil's Island in French Guyana. Following his arrest, for a crime he did not commit, Charrière is given a life sentence. Prison life is brutal and Charrière's character is stubborn and rebellious, resulting in multiple spells in solitary confinement.There is some controversy as to the authenticity of Charrière's memoirs. That said, it's a gripping story and a page turner. I recommend it."
4,Quite different from the film.,"Quite different from the film. I found it hard to believe every story, but still a good read for those interested."
2,Not for me,"I always find it a bit unsettling when I don't enjoy a book everyone raves about. My problem with Papillon was twofold. A lot of people compared it to Shantaram when recommending it to me. Gregory David Roberts created such vivid characters, and Papillon is really only about one person (you never get to know much about anyone else). Secondly, I didn't like Papillon, the person, he never felt real, he seemed too good to be true. If he was really such an amazing, noble person how would he end up with a life sentence in the first place. The cherry on the cake was when I read that some of his story was actually taken from other inmates experiences. This is a very popular book, so you may well enjoy it, even though it wasn't for me."
5,Papillon,"Charriere is an engrossing storyteller. This book is about an innocent man's will to survive and escape the abhorrent conditions of the French penal institutions in Guiana. Unfortunately, there are countries in this world that similarly adopt such horrid practices. I also recommend ""Banco"" for those who enjoyed reading Papillon. It is about the further adventures of Charriere."
4,Great Story,"I really enjoyed reading this book as more of a story than an actual historical account of what happened to one man. I got the feeling that this book was more a collection of stories from both the author and his fellow prisoners. In other words, take some of it with a grain of salt.That being said, it was still a great read."
2,Great book...terrible translation,"Great book. Part novel. Part autobiography. Thrilling, compulsive and picturesque. But this is a truly terrible translation. It tries to emulate penal colony slang but fails. Get the UK version with the padlock/butterfly on the cover. It's by Patrick O'Brien (Master and Commander etc)"
5,gotta be read!,stomach churning gut turning seat gripping.It goes beyond drama in that its truth hits you between the eyes and will not let you put the book down. I left it in love with the man he is a true hero. You cant find the words to write about it because it is just incredible.
3,Interesting story but.....,"I actually really enjoyed reading the book. Its 400+ pages passed by without a lull though after reading it a while I started doubting some of the stories. Not that the ordeal was too unbelieveable just that everything he did he was the best at it. He was the best gardner, the best fisherman, the best animal hearder, the best you name it! When the wardens of all three of the penal islands got together and summoned Papillon to tell THEM how to handle goverment inquieries into a failed prison revolt was the topper. He states he had lucid dreams while in solitary confinement and I wonder if some of the stories weren't imagined episodes made real by such isolation. Any Psych majors out there? So if you look at it as a work of fiction it is a VERY enjoyable book but if you look at it as a 100% true story you'll feel like you're being taken for a ride."
4,Against all odds,This is a great story of human endurance and survival and of where you can hide things. It is also interesting from a historical point of view about penal colonies. The only thing I didnt like was Henri himself.
1,Do NOT Buy!,"We gave this to my son (who was almost 3 at the time) for Christmas and within minutes he had pulled the clubs apart. Each golf club is 3 pieces of cheap plastic glued together with cheap glue. Once they were pulled apart we tried just fitting them back together. They didn't stay. We tried model glue, which is suppose to melt the plastic together, but that didn't work. Don't waste your money on this. We're planning to get either the Little Tikes or Fisher-Price set that are around $20."
5,A delight!,"Bettine has given us a wonderful account of her life and her music. Always interesting, forever uplifting, and deeply moving, this book is a must to read!"
4,Good buy,"I purchased this item in April 2007. It still works very well and provides me with exactly what I was looking for. The only negatives I would have to point out is it is a little loud, which means you have to turn up the volume of the TV or radio if you use that to help occupy your time and the pulse rate check has never worked. But all in all, it is a very good treadmill and work the money. I would definitely recommend it."
2,Disappointed,There is nothing in the manual that indicates there is an incline adjustment which is located in the back. The heart monitor doesn't seem to work all the time and there is a trick to where you place your finger which is over the heart shape versus the round circle. Finally the treadmill speeds up uncontrollably and after a while may shut off. They are sending me new control boards and heart monitor to see if that fixes the problem. Their tech will come over and install the parts.They installed new control boards and it still had problems. I was impressed that they offered to replace the treadmill without me asking. Good customer service.
4,Very good deal.....,"I bought this treadmill new, assembled out of box.....I've had it for about 2 years now and use it on the average 60 minutes a day, 3 days a week. It has held up great!! Sturdy. Well built. Control panel is easy to see, easy to use, nice big buttons. The ONLY complaints I have are that the heart rate monitor has never really worked and therefore the calories burned per workout are way off...like WAY OFF!! For 60 minutes walk at 3.0 mph, the treadmill said I burned 200 calories....the heart rate monitor I had strapped to my chest said I burned over 400...big difference!! Just be warned. Otherwise great treadmill for the money...does have a reasonable incline, folds up nice and I just push it back to the wall. I'm 5'7"" and 160 lbs and I have done a full turbo run on that thing and it's well made. Great deal just don't trust the HR/calorie readout. It's wrong :-)"
1,What a Joke,Who would sell a treadmill for a weight limit of 250 lbs.????Are only skinny people allowed to loose weight?Please - find a brain and make it those of us who REALLY need it.
3,aftermath of Roger's accident,"Bill Malloy determines that the brakes on Roger's car failed because the bleeder valve had been removed. He informs Roger that the car crash was no accident.Collinsport Inn waitress Maggie Evans tells her father, Sam, that she wants an end to the mysterious and stressful relationship between him, Roger Collins, and Burke Devlin."
4,Pike Street 310 count Comforter set - Gold,This is a nice comforter for the money. It is a pretty color and good quality. The only problem i see is that is a little wrinkled and I haven't ironed it yet.. Other than that it looks good in my bedroom. I like the color gold since it looks so elegant. It is very warm for the cold winter we have been having here in Michigan..
5,comforter just in time for cold weather,iordered the pike street woven stripe comforter as i wanted a light comforter for winter. It is wonderful and quite a bargain.
3,A little Disappointed,"I ordered this item back when it was a Deal Of The Day and unfortunately at the time there was only one review saying that the color wasn't what they thought. I ordered white so I had no problems there but was disappointed when the comforter arrived to find that it was not at all as soft as I thought it would be. Even after washing it, it didn't make help too much.I decided to keep it anyways because I needed something and with use it has gotten a little bit better. I know that you do get what you paid for but something that was advertised at a much higher price I expected it to be at least a little softer. It does have a good thickness which will help in the coming winter months."
4,Passed the whippet test,"I bought a navy set for Mom. The all-cotton shell is nice and soft and the navy color I selected goes better with most of the dog hairs available at our house. Very important is the fact that my brother's comfort-seeking Rocket the Idiot Whippet has given the new comforter the Whippet Seal of Approval, preferring it to the other comforter for napping, snoozing, lolling, and other vital dog activities. Although a family joke this really does prove that even new out of the box this comforter is nicer and softer than the other which is fairly new and fluffy but has a poly-cotton shell and just isn't as good a quality. I am hoping that the quality of the fabric will stand up better to Rocket's nest-building which involves fairly vigorous digging in the bedding.(The dachshunds like the new comforter too. Oh, and so does Mom.)"
2,"""Gold"" Comforter Set",I was disappointed to find that the color of the set was much different from that shown in the display picture. It is indeed a very yellow gold color and not in the least the golden/taupe it appears online.
1,Lame movie,Huge waste of money... Bad acting and one of the main character doesn't even speak in the whole movie.Justin
2,"Summer the first time, my first video.","It was the first time for me ever to watch a gay video. I had learned about Johan Paulik on the internet and he fascinated me. I do not have the guts to go the the videoshop and rent one of his films there, so I ordered one here on Amazon. It arrived today.I knew nothing about this film, besides Johan Paulik starring, but I think I expected to much of it allready. It was dissappointing to see most beautiful men having sex, but without showing their erected pride. Maybe I was informed badly, but I also found that the video had a very, very slow story. Boring actually. However I did enjoy watching the men, if only they would have showed more.... I love Johan Paulik!"
2,Not much for your money,"You don't get much for your money here. If you are looking to learn about the enneagram, you are better off reading a more comprehensive book like ""Personality Types"" by Riso and Hudson or for more technical reading the work of Claudio Naranjo."
2,Not that helpful,Was recommended to read some of Palmer's work for a class. This didn't exactly cut it. I was told that she was very thoughtful and that the Ennegram would guide my life. Instead this truncated version left me confused.
4,M40 Toy Gun,i bought this a toy for my son. hes 8 and loves WW2 era military. this was just another gun to his collection and he loved it. now he can plays as the germans. and he plays as the americans and the japanese.
5,"Yes, one of GLH's best!","Tells the story of Patricia, from grade school through young womanhood, as she tries to find herself and her place in life. Her mother and social circle push her in directions she does not wish to go and she at first resists without knowing why, but after awhile finds it easier to just go along. In the end Patricia is forced to choose between accepting what almost everyone seems to say she should do, or to follow a secret dream that even she thinks unreal. But she hangs on until the day comes that she has a real choice.The two main villains in this book are more threatening than usual for GLH. Dramatic ending, even though expected, will make you cheer through the tears."
5,Patrica,"I had never read this book before , it was a great Grace Livingstion Hill book. The book came in great shape and in a speedy manner. Thank you."
4,Good Reference Book - Not a Beginners Linus Text,"This is a great 872 page book for computer professionals with some experience using UNIX/Linux or a different distribution package of Linux like SuSE. It is not a good text book for teaching new students without Linux background and limited networking experience.Many concepts are described using ""Linux terms"" not understood by a beginner, and there is no glossary from which to look up the definition of these words. There are no review questions at the end of the chapters to gauge one's understanding of the material presented, and few pictures accompanying the information presented.If you have a Linux background and want a good reference or need to learn about the Red Hat distribution of Linux - this is a very good book for you. If you are a Linux beginner, let me recommend a book called ""Teach Yourself Linux Red Hat"". It is a highly visual, easily understood, excellent beginning Red Hat Linux text.Trish Millis"
3,A solid blues CD,"This is a solid CD of old blues songs, but not a special one. There are 10 songs, 2 each by 5 different artists. Dave Specter's songs are the strongest in my opinion, ""That's How Strong My Love Is"" and ""I'm on the Outside (Looking In)"". Luther Allison does good renditions of two classics, ""Dust My Broom"" and ""The Sky is Crying"". The opening song by Junior Wells, ""Snatch it Back and Hold it"" is a good song. The Little Walter offerings were ok, nothing spectacular and neither Louis Myers song did anything for me. This CD won't set your world on fire but you won't be sorry you listened either."
4,Crabby turns a dry subject into something moist and delicious.,"Her humor pulls you along through the subject matter, making it easy to learn and understand while also having a good laugh. This is a great book for anyone wanting to learn more about Microsoft Office, email etiquette, and myriad other topics."
3,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in the book. I thought it would be a compendium of Crabby Office Lady articles. Instead, it it no more than instructions on using various components of Microsoft Office. Was not worth the price."
2,The MS Crabby Office Lady - Kindergarden stuff,Far too basic for the money spent on buying this title.
2,Disappointed,"This book was difficult to read. It was filled with mechanical errors. words were spelled wrong, the grammar was off, and several parts of the book were switched."
1,Beware,"First of all, this is not the Hickie translation. 'nuff said? That should stop you right there.I believe it is the 1912 London Athenian Society translation widely available on the net.Second: a glitch (or something) limited the download (across multiple devices, i checked and retried) to the end (or so) of Act one, line 1150.Save your dollar."
2,"Complete Works, 14 tracks? No way!","A CD purporting to be Joplin's complete works would certainly have more than 14 tracks. Instead try ""The Complete Piano Music Of Scott Joplin,"" AISN B000003QWN; four disks containing 52 tracks! I think this would be far more likely to be his ""complete works"" though I think even this one must be leaving out some of the compositions of this prolific ragtime composer. I know for a fact 14 songs wouldn't be his complete... anything! If you just want an introduction to his music, this CD may be all the Joplin you need, but be sure to rub out the word ""complete"" when your CD arrives. :)"

5,Blackies Best,"This Concept Album From The Mad Mind Of Blackie Lawless Is The BEST That W.A.S.P Has Ever Put Out. From The Opening Riff, To The Closing Of The Story, You Will NOT Be Disappointed."
5,Captured lightning in a bottle,"This is a re-release of the 1999 album from W.A.S.P. I've always been a fan of Blackie Lawless but he outdid himself with this album. It is without a doubt his best work after The Headless Children. This album tells the story (semi-autobiographically) of a kid who want to be a rock star, no matter the cost. He's a disappointment to his father and gets dragged through the dark side of the music business, drugs, groupies, and sycophants.Highlights are Arena Of Pleasure, I Am One, The Idol, and the acoustic classic Hold On To My Heart. Blackies' version of the Led Zep classic When The Levee Breaks on disc 2 is worth a good listen too.Musically, this album is top notch. The riffs are great with plenty of hooks to keep you banging your head, and Bobby Benalli's pounding double bass drums are phenomenal. Blackies' lyrics are introspective and way above anything he's written up to this point in his career."
4,music for the mind body and soul,"I have enjoyed listening to this band for many years now. With each new album the lyrics have a deeper sense of meaning written from the heart and sung with such passion. Great music, lyrics, and listening"
2,"WASP, crimson idol","I'm a long time fan of WASP & in fact THIS is the only studio album I don't like, it just seem to take itself too seriously (if that makes sense). It's just my opinion but maybe there was too much thought put into this album."
2,ZZZZZZZZZ,"I've tried a few times but I just can't make it thru this CD. While I'm listening to it I find myself saying out loud ""This is BORING"". The story is dull, the music is dull. I got really tired of hearing ""where is the love to shelter me?"" The drummer sounds like he's beating on garbage cans half the time. I didn't care for his singing either, it was too whiny. I didn't think there was even 1 song I'd ever care to hear again. I can't see me ever putting this CD on again. However, a couple of other people really liked it as you can see from their reviews."
2,I love W.A.S.P but..,"I am a true blue W.A.S.P fan, but this CD is just not worth it. I see what Blackie was trying to do here, but he just didn't pull it off. However, he did redeem himself years later with another epic CD titled The Neon God, which is excellent especially on tunes like ASYLUM #9, ME AND THE DEVIL, WHY AM I NOTHING? oh, that whole album rocks. Pass up The Crimson Idol...go buy THE NEON GOD, you can thank me later."
2,Mouth To Mouth,"""Mouth To Mouth"" is a contrived movie. The script written by some one taking Ritilan or some drug used for Adult Attention Disorder. The story ambles in several lost directions. Of course, Ellen Page, does the best she can given the level of the material she had to work with. It is difficult to believe that she would choose to follow up ""Juno"" and ""Smart People"" with a movie such as ""Mouth To Mouth"". I do believe Ellen needs to be advised, that even though 'they' offered you a movie, it does not mean you actually need to do it. Ellen and her manager need to know when to say""NO"". ""Mouth To Mouth"" is definitely a NO movie."
4,gift,Bought this as a gift to replace the one I hmm (took over). Seems warn and confy like the one I took over.
2,I'm waiting for my jacket,I received my jacket in a timely manner but I ordered the wrong size and sent it back for another size. As of this date I haven't received my jacket or a response from the company. I have a delivery confirmation receipt that it was in house by October 30th. I'm awaiting my jacket and know that I'll be sending a very positive review after it arrivesWomen's Katahdin Tek Polar Fleece Full Zip
2,Your hands won't enjoy this fleece jacket,"I'm 170cm male with around 34"" chest. I ordered the small one, it fits OK but the shoulder to the elbow area seems too baggy for my taste(shoulda gone XS). The zipper seems ok, color is exactly as in picture. One major disappointment is that the inner lining of the pocket is NOT FLEECE. That got me quite upset since I was hoping to bask my hands in comforting fleece."
4,cold in calif.,Nice jacket but a little smaller than I thought it would be..But should be nice to wear when it gets really COLD in S.Calif. maybe in the 50's..lol
2,Scorches Like Napalm . . .,"This shave gel -- while featuring a manly, alluring scent that some ladies will like -- burns like hell! Definitely not for sensitive skin."
5,What a moron.,"[...] Anyways, Dol Guldur is a WONDERFUL album and I recommend it to anyone that likes a low quality that actually SOUNDS GOOD. Their unique style of drumming is what stands out the most! As well as the Vocals for the two guys Protector and Silenius. The sound period is unique with a medieval touch to it. Just about all their cds have a tempo between slow and medium. Just about all their songs have a depth to it which would mean alot to a black metaller. If I were you id at least take a peek at this cd! And others as well!"
1,Boring,"I found it difficult to read and NOT helpful. It may be suited for a very experience Bridge players, which I am not."
2,Not for duplicate players -- very dated rubber bridge oriented,"Very dated. I found it an odd book. Seems to be oriented toward rubber bridge players who play with pickup partners. There is a bit of useful stuff buried in the book. But sections dealing with runs of good or bad luck and how to play with various different partner types with assorted weaknesses, left me cold."
4,Fun...,"I'm a 37 year old guy who found a mummies c.d. in used music store and haven't been musically the same since. What can I say about this album, Musically it's a mess, but you don't care because you can hear the fun they are having. supposedly the bassist and the drummer decided to form a band, took four weeks to learn how to play their respective instruments, and started playing gigs! I can totally buy that. But this album is basically a humongous middle finger to what is considered ""cool"" in music today, and I cannot hate it for that."
4,Pure Trash.,"If you took Thee Headcoatees, the Frumpies and surf music and threw them into a psychotic blender, you might get the Trashwomen. An offbeat, often playful mix of songs, ""Spend the Night..."" is a short, quick burst of yowling energy. The only downside to this obscure jewel is that it's under a half-hour and quite a few of the songs are instrumentals. But even with that and the challenge you'll encounter trying to find it, it is still worth your time. If the sun rises and sets for you with the punk screech of a female, this is for you. Now let's hope someone releases the rest of the Trashwomen oeuvre on CD."
4,O-U-T-S-T-A-N-D-I-N-G,"If you tell someone that they'll be watching a documentary about spelling bees, the first thing you will hear is choral snoring. However, if you pass this one up because of it's supposedly dull subject-matter, you'll be passing up a real gem of a film.This is the biography of eight young, intelligent, spellers from around the country. They are from varied backgrounds, but they all have one thing in common: they are terrific spellers. They have all won their regional spelling bee and moved on to the natioanl spelling bee in Washington DC. For those of you who have lost hope in the youth of today, this movie will turn you around. Each child has the work ethic and desire to do thier very best against all odds, and they all have the ability.It's truly enjoyable to see these youngsters mature over the course of the film, right until the nailbiting finale. Very little is wrong with this film. It's an excellent documentary that I highly recommend."
5,Thrilling!!,"It is hard for me to express how much I loved this movie. I'm all for escapism, drama, or eye candy in movies. However, this film is a perfect example of how the experiences of real people can be just as compelling. The kids each have distinct personalities and differing reasons for participating in the National Spelling Bee. Watching them interact with their family, and discuss what the competition means to them is charming. Hearing the expectations of the parents is at times amusing, other times infuriating. Once you get to the actual competition in Washington, you feel for these kids so much that it ends up being nerve-wracking and intense even for the theater audience. If you see one movie this summer, don't make it another soulless special-effects behemoth. Spellbound is where the real drama is to be found."
5,How do you spell splendiferous?,"Spellbound is a humane masterpiece. The children are endearing and fascinating, and their families are so revealing. This film could be profitably used in the junior high or high school classroom as a springboard for discussion of any number of things--individual learning styles, the value (or not) of competition, goal-setting and the drive to be the best, accepting those who are different, what it means to be an immigrant, etc. The film should also be seen by any person who is or intends to be a language arts teacher for this age group, because for many of these students, the teacher was very involved in the process, and we get to meet several of them as the film progresses. Great, great documentary."
5,MOST ENDEARING FILM AROUND!,"This documentary is the sweetest and funniest I have ever seen! If you're feeling a tad blue, or just in the mood to laugh - this is a MUST SEE! The filmmaker tracts the trials and tribulations of brilliant children and their families in search of the National Spelling Bee championship. You'll be amazed at the effort and dedication these children put forth as they make sacrifices to be the best speller they can be. If children in our country are truly this earnest and talented - our world is surely in very good hands!"
5,Spell bound,It is amazing! One of the best documentaries I ve seen in a long time. It is funny and entertaining. Geeky but definitely has a sense of humour!
3,Driven,"I rented this one thinking it was the Hitchcock film with Gregory Peck. I was surprised and not delighted that this 2002 Spellbound was actually a documentary about school kids and spelling bee's. Anyhow, I began to watch and saw that out there across the country, terrific children were studying words, spelling words as though their life depended on it. A better title would have been, Driven. As any child prodigy of the violin will tell you, a child's life was not theirs. The final spelling bee in Washington DC was very exciting. Who will win, the Indian genius kid or the Texas chick with the goggle glasses? Adults and kids can watch the fun together."
4,A great change in the faith of a great part of the world,"A great change in the faith of a great part of the world and its shadow on a great family. This family I mean is not only the factory owners but all the workers and the public included. The family is slowly degenerating and the author is performing this topic in all ways of degenerating in the scene. The setting is the beginning of 20th century. As a summary; a grandfather who adores work and builds a factory from nothing, a father who doesn't care about anything, and his son trying to find a way to escape from work."
5,Timeless perfection,"I will say it: Ryuichi Sakamoto is a genius! There. I said it. If you need proof of it, ""1996"" is it.Sakamoto's influence and influences are so vast, they are hard to fully grasp. Pulling in from Japanese as well as from Brazilian, from Jazz and Bossanova as well as from Classical music, he's scored numerous movies for directors of the stature of Bertolucci, Almodovar, Stone and De Palma and he's collaborated with the likes of Bowie, Sylvian, Caetano Veloso and Bill Laswell among others, along the way.""1996"" compiles newly arranged pieces by the Japanese maestro that will blow you away with their serene beauty and timeless quality. If I had to pick a favorite track in here, it'd have to be ""Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence"" but the truth is all tracks are impeccable in terms of content and execution. Ten years after its original release, the album sounds as perfect as it did in 1996."
5,Way Mellow,"This is a wonderful CD for just calmly sitting in a chair with your eyes shut and the earphones on. No complicated bass lines, drum beats or samples, just Ryuchi, a violin and a Cello.Very relaxing. My twin girls drift off when they hear it and I'm not far behind....zzzzzzzzzz"
1,The only reason to buy this is for the music!,"This is a very bad video. A weak plot about hospitals and machines trying to kill patients and a lack of sympathetic characters explains why this was not given a theatrical release and went straight to video. David McCallum turns in a good performance, but he is wasted on a weak script. The best thing about this is the music, by Shadows drummer Brian Bennett, which heightens suspense where applicable and keeps well into the background at other times. There is also a quiet, romantic theme. The score was re-worked as a Shadows track for album release, but the better version is on this video. one for collectors only!"
2,Disappointing,"I was hoping for details about being a commercial pilot. What I got was like a memoir written for a few close friends. The author repeatedly mentions names of pilots with whom he flew and their personality quirks...as though that might be meaningful to everyone who picked up this book.Another irksome quality: the author thinks all of American's problems are traceable to right-wing Christian fanatics, and for some reason, he, out of nowhere, launches into a tirade against these folks. Along the way, we find out that he's all for polygamy and sleeping around since most societies in the world do it that way.Again, I was expecting a book devoted to flying. There is some of that in there...sadly, not enough."
5,One of the Best Salsa CD's ever!,"Ever since I bought this CD back in 2001 I became Mickey's fan! La musica es sin duda poesia. This is one of my best CD's. If you like Salsa and love Romantic latin music you must own this CD. Every song is a hit and you will instantly love his voice, lyrics and music! ""Porque Te Quiero"" is a song you must listen with high volume in your car... awesome! Fantastico! M4."
3,did not meet my expectations.,"although its a well built player , its quite heavy the remote needs alot of work to make it more user friendly, the keys are small and the way the remote is set up it really makes it difficult to manage it especially in the dark.i found that with this player its almost imperative that you get the latest updates and use them, otherwise this player is very slow to respond and just doesn't seem like it wants to cooperate.perhaps its because i am use to using some very nice other regular dvd players that are really user friendly that i am being abit critical. also i really cannot tell a big difference between the sound and picture on the hdvd versus a good quality dvd played on lets say my nice dvd player thats also has a hdmi output, there just doesn't seem to be much difference for the price.sorry toshiba but i think you might have done alittle bit more market research before diving into this arena."
4,great picture but slow,"would be 5 stars if it was faster to start and a bit less cumbersome (ok, while I'm at wish list: add sacd too)"
3,"Good Machine, but don't buy this model","This is a very good machine. It will upconvert regular discs to their highest resolution. It works great with a HDTV and a HDMI cable. I bought mine when it first hit the market, so the prices are fabulous. So why not buy this model?1. Only plays at 1080i. 1080p is the highest resolution. You can get the A20/A30 for a similar price.2. a LOT of freezing, especially rentals. I don't have many problems with DVDs I own, but rentals freeze 95% of the time.3. VERY SLOW. You can go to the bathroom and come back by the time the system is ready. When you push a button, WAIT. It recogninzed the command, but it needs a few minutes to think.If you don't have a HD player (blu-ray or HD-DVD) then I would by the better model or a PS3."
4,Toshiba HD-A1,"I'm happy with my new Toshiba HD-A1... but I'd suggest you don't buy one based on comments of how your standard DVD's will now look hi-def. I see no noticable improvement in sharpness. Think about this - what's the information capacity of a DVD vs. HD DVD. No matter how fancy the up conversion, the information just isn't on the standard DVD. I did see an improvement in the way colors are handled on std DVDs.Like many others have commented, the remote is impossible to read in dim light. The fan is fairly loud, but I have mine in a cabinet and that blocks the sound completely.My setup is an HDMI cable to a Panasonic AE900U projector."
5,No problems from day one,"I've never experienced any of the lock-up issues that have been reported in countless user reviews and on-line ""expert"" articles. I'll admit the HD-DVD player start-up is noticeably slower than my old SD DVD player. HD-DVD discs are amazing and the up-conversion is the best I've ever seen. I've gone back and watched several of my SD movies in the last couple of weeks and was blown away by the improved picture quality and not to mention the sound has somehow improved too. The firmware update couldn't be easier, pop in a disc or connect to the Internet, showing a strong commitment to future support."
4,A great player if you can handle cutting edge quirks,"I thought I had a broken player but I simply didn't realize how incredibly sensitive these things are to a even a small smudge or part of a fingerprint.. let alone even a small scratch on the disk. Considering that this thing is really a fairly powerful computer inside the price is an absolute steal. Picture quality is just incredible. Support picks up on the fist ring! (when I didn't realize how sensitive the reader was to smudges I found that out) You can't get HD any better than this. Technically this thing only puts out 1080i but with a good 1080p TV with conversion you will never notice any difference, not even in a side by side comparision. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it takes too long to play both HD and normal DVDs which makes it not exactly and ideal replacement for a regular DVD player, but you do get used to it."
2,Toshiba HD-A1 DVD Player,"Toshiba HD-A1 HD-DVD Playeris my first HD-DVD player I purchased. However, its slow pace of start up as well as reading the disk is a snail speed, may be 1 minute. The remote control is so hard to read with very small letters imprinted on black color background. The up-conversion function is not very good, compare to my other DVD plaver. Plus on several occasion, it failed to read or play the disk which I have no problem to play on other DVD player. Toshiba should have done better than that at the price we paid for"
2,Save your money,"Going in I knew it was slow to load/eject and that the remote was difficult to use but I bought it anyway. Without a magnifying glass and a flashlight to read the remote, you'll need to rely on memory for what button does what ... they all look the same. I'd like to meet the mental midget that designed it.Picture quality wasn't much better than my Denon non-HD.Wait for something better."
1,"HORRIBLE REMOTE, SLOW player and NOISEY FAN","CONS:REMOTE CONTROL: Very poorly designed remote! Impossible to read labels on the buttons in a dimly lit room with out a flashlight (and a magnifying glass)! The buttons all look the same. The remote is too long, too heavy, is not ergonomic and it is made of metal which feels cold in your hand.COOLING FAN: The cooling fan is loud. This unit is as loud as some desktop PCs!SLOW: Overall the player is very slow... When stopping, starting, exiting setup mode, ejecting or inserting a disk the player may take up to one or two minutes!CONCLUSION: I am returning this player to BestBuy on Monday and I will wait to buy the new Sony Blu-ray BDP-S1 player when it becomes available.SUGGESTION: Wait for the Sony Blu-ray BDP-S1 player."
5,Love it so far...,"I just received my player 2 days ago and after watching Chronicles of Riddick, Tomb Raider, and LOTR Return of the King (to check the upconverting) I am totally happy. Great picture on both HD DVD disks and upconverted DVD disks. A little slow but much quicker than I expected after reading the other reviews prior to purchase. Highly recommended."
4,Toshiba HD-A1 HD DVD Player,"Excellent picture quality. Upgrades non HD DVD's to an improved picture quality. Required a firmware update which was sent to me from Toshiba(cd-rom disk), didn't want to download the firmware update over the internet but that is available.Very large remote with small buttons, the more expensive model is back lit which would be an advantage.Has longer than normal load times, more computer like in this regard. I feel that it is a very sofisticated DVD player and I am very satisified with the results.Have not experimented with the audio portion as of yet and do not notice an improvement in sound as far as CD's are concerned."
2,Cluncky,"The pause option doesn't work very well. When I restart a DVD after having hit pause the DVD often starts over. I have often had to unplug the machine when it gets frozen. The machine always takes a long time to start up. Besides being able to play HD-DVDs, it is far worse than most cheap DVD players."
2,Early Adopting,"Don't get me wrong, staying on the cutting edge of technology affords bragging rights and gobs of ear and eye candy, however the exterior of this unit looks like it was manufactured in the 1980's. Features, looks and specs will vastly improve with the '07 models across the board. Just an observation while you drop your hundreds here."
2,Doesn't Support 1080p,"Ok so I should have read the fine print, but it turns out that even though HD DVD's are all encoded at 1080p, the players only support 1080i and 720p. I think I will return mine and wait for a true HD DVD."
1,Piece of garbage,"This player is a complete piece of garbage. Not ready for prime-time, but it was still rushed to the market. While the picture quality is excellent (when it successfully plays DVDs) as you would expect with the HD-DVD format, it takes up to *2 minutes* to load up a DVD and start playing it. Just performing a power-up boot takes at least a minute. In addition it does not play DVD+R discs. In many cases it would not play any disc you insert into it and required several reboots to play it correctly. I returned mine immediately and instead got a Denon 1080p-upconverting player and am happy with the picture quality.Bottom line: Toshiba's HD DVD players are not yet ready for prime-time. Besides, with the annoying fact that there are 2 competing formats for hi-def DVD (VHS vs Betamax all over again) I am going to wait until HD-DVD or Blu-Ray is declared the winner."
1,WARNING Stay away,I got this DVD player 2 weeks ago and it is already dead! - It is very slow to load a dvd or eject a DVD ~ 20 seconds. Then when I had issues with it not recognizing a DVD I whent on the network and downloaded a firmware upadate. This then killed all my HD capacity and now I only have regular dvd playback. Toshiba support said wait for another firmware update to see if it could fix it but did not say when probably a few months or more. Oh how I wasted $500 on this junk!
5,Thank you !!,came early and was a great gift ... thank you !! It brought the true spirit of Christmas to their home.
4,A Mission Indeed,"Fr. Schmemann raises questions and tries to answer the role of the Orthodox Church in the future and dealing specifically with important topics such as theology, eschatology, world, state, and the Orthodox expierence (just to name a few things).Especially interesting chapters are ""The World in Orthodox Thought and Expierence"", ""A Meaningful Storm"", and ""Freedom in the Church."" This entire book is interesting, thought provoking and he is quick to critizes the Orthodox Church where it is needed.His assertions are well thoughtout and as always, Schmemann is direct; however, at times the book does ""bog down."" Schmemann, though direct in his positions, could, I think, be more concise in his ""wording"" or ""mechanics"" - hence the four stars.Otherwise, a great book worth reading."
2,"lights are ok, cheap wiring",The wiring is very thin and of poor quality. The plugs were so poorly made I didn't even use them.
2,quick and efficient seller but disappointed with product,"I was so excited to receive the Caldrea Basil Blue Sage Stainless Steel Spray in the mail. Of course, the first thing I did upon delivery was to try it out on my stainless steel refrigerator (the very reason I bought the product). Like most facial products I invested in, this product will join their company in the back of cabinets. After the first use, like all the other similar products I have tested, my refrigerator was left with film and smears. Even though I worked it in and tried ""polishing"" the stainless steel, I was left disappointed and frustrated. I have recently learned that the best way to maintain beauty and shine for stainless steel appliances is by cleansing the surface with a mild dishwashing detergent and then using extra virgin olive oil to protect and polish the stainless steel. The results are better than any products I have come across. The seller is dependable; the product was disappointing. I hope this is helpful."
3,Oh If Only...,"The energy on this cd is outstanding. The real disapointment however is the sound quality. There is a guitar that is very low in the mix, and it is a strain trying to hear it, which is a shame. The songs are all great one after the other,oh only if it had better sound.I would rate this 5 stars if the mix was better, because the music is first rate all the way."
2,The recording sounds like someone put it thru a cassette.,"Service good, quick receipt. CD was in good condition. But it sounded like it was recorded on a cassette tape. Poor quality sounding CD, sounded like it unprofessionally recorded."
4,A peek into the real Hollywood,"A real page turner! Eric Alexander clearly knows a great deal about the movie business, and winds this into a fast-paced action story. I hope the next one will lift the lid yet further on the real Hollywood."
4,Movies are good,"If you read product details carefully, you may notice this is a box set of ""Bulletproof"",""Happy Gilmore"",""Billy Madison"". But I did't! I thought it was one like ""snl: the best of A.S.""...Stil, these movies are fun. Especially Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison. There's naughty-sexy-bad boy Adam in these 2!So why 4 stars instead of 5? 'Cause I see no set value like discount or something. Maybe buying favolite 3 items seems better."
1,"Ordered this item and got ""Waterboy"" instead of ""Happy Gilmore"" the box said ""Happy Gilmore"" but it had been replaced.",When you order something you expect it to be right and this simply wasnt what I ordered.
2,good collection,I liked Billy Madason and Happy Gilmore a lot. One of my favorite movies. Bulletproof was not that good of a movie. Ypu are better off by getting Billy Madason and Happy Gillmore sepritly.
2,I just don't get it,"Adam Sandler seems like a very nice guy and it's great to see guys like him become successful. I just don't understand why people like his work so much, though. I don't think he's ever made me laugh even once. I'm not saying that I'm right and that other people are wrong but Sandler is the clearest example I've ever seen of how totally subjective humor can be. Afterall, millions of people gobble up whatever he does. I just won't be one of 'em. I doubt they'll miss me, either."
3,"Athmospheric but in the end, tedious","Not many special effects needed if you keep most of your film in one apartment complex, but then you need great actors and an excellent script. I didn't see much of either. Did watch the film to completion, but it failed to deliver - just not very interesting."
1,Do Not Rent This Movie !!!!,"In my opinion, and with all due respect to think otherwise.......do not rent this movie unless your purpose is to experience just how bad a movie can be."
4,LOVED IT as a low budget horror,"So as a lover of cult horror films i picked this up because usually I go off the rule: Lower the budget the better. (website says it was funded by American soldiers) But I was actually decently surprised to find out the effects weren't cheesy or anything. The story line built up, acting was good, pretty creative, feels like all the ""end of the world sickness"" flicks that are popular right now. Would be perfect to watch on a stormy night with someone to snuggle up to. Overall very happy :)"
4,Low Budget Creeper,Stumbled on this recently. They have a website that explains how it was made with funding from US troops in Iraq for about $150K. Looks great for that price. It's a slow building creepy little film with great acting that gets under your skin. Recommend it for a dark night.
1,Awful,"A complete waste of time. Interesting plot, but poorly executed... The acting was horrible.The movie became comical because it was so terrible... Definitely the worst post-apocalyptic movie I've seen."
1,Absolute Shyte!,"It is always frustrating when you read a few reviews giving a movie high praise, only to find out that the movie is completely worthless.Well, that's what happened here.OMG, I can't remember the last time I wanted to throw such derogatory words towards the people who rated this movie highly.Whomever did the soundtrack, had a tough job; and they failed.The music is constantly building towards climaxes that never happen.The main character is a whimpering woman who sets back feminism to the ice ages.Don't waste your time. This is a boring movie, a boring...boring...BORING MOVIE!!!!!!Limited budget? Obviously. Not because of a lack of special efx, but because of lack of talented actors.That being said, the actors didn't have much to work with because the character development was sorely lacking as well."
1,Man this film sucks,"There isn't much to say about this movie. It's not scary, it's boring and it sucks. It was a waste of money and time to watch it."
1,fast forward to the familiar ending,"This is a slow, slow film about another epidemic that kills off most of the world's population. Perhaps the director meant to show more character development than in the usual end of the world - but none of the actors nor the dialogue are anything you would want to sit through. Fast forward after the first 5 minutes to the last 5 minutes and see who survives in the end."
3,Not bad,To many bad reviews. This is not a bad movie.Sally sells sea shells by the sea shore. one two.
4,Unwed Mothers...,"Who knew?Fetal alcohol syndrome just was not on the radar when Rex wrote this one. Faith Usher, a guest at a special banquet honoring illegitimate moms, dies shortly after drinking a champagne toast.It as the murderer's hard luck that Faith's chosen usher is Wolfe's assistant, Archie Goodwin. It just won't do to have Archie's date die right in front of him...This one, like ""The Mother Hunt,"" addresses Stout's preoccupation with society's conventions around maternity. And of course ""The Father Hunt"" talks about paternity, and sometimes how it's wiser not to know some things..."
4,Solid Wolfe outing,A straightforward mystery to solve...how does a young woman commit suicide in front of a watchful Archie Goodwin. She didn't as Archie contends and Wolfe proves; she was murdered. The whole gang investigates in this one and it will keep you guessing as there are a variety of reasons for young Faith Usher's demise. The ending is a little weak as it relies on police investigation to tie the murderer up but a good addition to the series.
4,simple fun,"another in a series of simple, well devised Nero Wolfe mysteries. if you like the series this is a ""gotta have""."
3,Its good but...,"I ordered 2 of the NL4FX connectors and 2 of the NL4FC connectors. After putting both sets of connectors together on the cables I needed for the 4-pole Speakon connections I have to say that the NL4FX is a solid B- connector and the NL4FC is A-. If you have a choice spend the extra money and get the NL4FC connectors, they are much easier to put together and have more flexibility."
5,Awesome,I had been missing this one for a long time. It never seemed to show up at my local music store. It was worth the effort to seek it out on line. This is not a half formed album. They are Man or Astroman from the first cut onward. If you groove on this band you must have this album. Sci-fi surf rock at its finest.If you like this band I highly reccomend this CD by Los Straitjackets:¡Viva!
2,"well, OK...","Yet another carbon-copy Man Or Astroman album. This band is quite prolific, and this album, while certainly not a bad one, will suffice as the MoA album of your choice. The band can play with a lot of energy, and they've always been tight, but the pitfalls still exist: lack of variety in tempos and keys, the one-song-represents-the-whole stigma, and of course, the pretentious TV-spacemen schtick, which is getting pretty old at this point. I would suggest, as an alternative, Shadowy Men On A Shadowy Planet, a Canadian instrumental/surf band with far more variety, whose creativity is stronger on the musical side, rather than the image. Not a bad record, this one, albeit generic, been done before, and been done better."
4,A west African jewel,"This album,the most recent of Angelique Kidjo's many releases, is a racier and upbeat return to the artiste's Euro-laced African pop. Apart from intriguing yet simple melodies, what will surprise many serious music lovers, who may otherwise dismiss this as a pop album, and therefore of no consequence, is the line-up of musical luminaries who play on this album. Among them, saxophonist Branford Marsallis, keyboardist Kenny Kirkland and bass phenomenon Bakhiti Khumalo. Add to these a whole slew of lesser known African talents. And, as always, Angelique Kidjo is a treat to listen to. She's bridged Euro-pop and African melodies in a pleasing and highly energetic mix that goes straight to the head and heart. A must listen for anyone with even a faint interest in World Music."
5,Angelique Kidjo at her best,"I recently purchased OREMI and must say that this CD is probably one of the finest of Angelique Kidjo's works. Her rendition of ""Voodoo Child"" (Hendrix) is not as hard as Jimi Hendrix's, but equally awesome. ""Itche Koutche"" will make you wish you were in the studio partying with her. ""No Worry"" will encourage you and lift you up when you're down. ""Yaki Yaki"" is an extremely catchy tune you'll be humming all day long. Many of the songs from thie Benin-born artist are in English this time out. I highly recommend this CD for you collection. If you're not a fan of Angelique Kidjo, just one listen to OREMI and you will be.Enjoy, Kim"
4,manu chao?,"Great album, I agree. I've heard that it's produced by Manu Chao, which sounds quite plausible from the sound of the album. Those who like Chao will find this album well worth a listen."
1,Mitsouko by Guerlain,I thought I was safe buying a well known brand like Guerlain.NOTThis perfume that I'm now stuck with; smells like a man's aftershave thatwent out of style in the 40'sHORRIBLE smell; never bought a perfume that I've ever been this disgusted with.and the seller? Took them TWO WEEKS to get it here; never had UPS been this turtley either.HORRIBLE XPERIENCE; WON'T BE BACK
1,the game is Too old,"I have a pretty new computer DX 9.0 3.2 duo core so i have a fast computer well this game when i tryed playing it not only had graphic's problems but you could'int change them,it won'ted me to installed DX 5.0 and i was like down grade no way so yeah i don't really like this one but kknd 2 crossfire is so much better and it works on fast computers try it out."
3,Pretty Decent,There is nudity. The girls are pretty. It does somewhat resemble wrestling. The commentators are so bad that they make you want to tie them up and gag them
5,Toates on Biological Psychology,"This text by Fred Toates is a spectacularly well done summary of the field of biological psychology. Not only would it be a first-rate text for courses, but an excellent self-education tool in one of the most exciting areas of science. The writing is crisp and interesting, permitting relatively easy reading of difficult materials. There are abundant examples to engage any student, and the illustrations are stunning. Toates does not avoid important philosophical issues as do many books of this type. He puts the all too abundant facts in a context which makes assimilation of material a delight. This is on the top of my list of texts to use in the relevant courses. It is also among the foremost I would recommend for those who want to study how brain and bodily functions help make us who we are."
2,Boring and wordy explanations,"I took a Biopsychology course with this textbook and I was entirely ungrateful that my professor chose it. This textbook is like a conglomeration of hundreds of research publications, instead of an introductory textbook. It would explain one topic after another without giving the reader a larger view of what all of this means in context to answering big biology and psychology questions. The paragraphs and sections were needlessly long and wordy. Instead of presenting easily accessible information, the author surrounded every fact with long-winded explanations."
2,Poorly organized! Boring!,"As an introductory textbook for Biological Psychology, this book could certainly take a step back. There is jumbles of information slipped in between long, and not to mention boring, wordy non-explanations. I think the author assumes too much of its readers. I can't seem to make sense of half this text, and I'm not dumb! This book was just organized in a fashion that I find extremely confusing. All graphics and the book itself was fine, just the writing was horrible."
1,disappointed,"I have seen David Sanborn, live in concert so many times this DVD is a REAL JOKE!!!! It's like you're watching saturday night live. If you're a real David Sanborn fan like myself please don't waste your time this LIVE DVD is TRASH!!!!"
4,Good textbook on logic,"This book is a nice overview of the foundations of modern logic with some additional non-traditional topics, such as modal logic included. Quine is necessary reading for all those interested in mathematical logic, philosophical logic, and theoretical foundations of computer science. By far the best chapter of the book is Chapter 33 which deals with the Skolem-Lowenheim theorem. Even though it is very short, Quine does a good job of explaining what this result is all about, and does so with upmost clarity. Another nice feature of the book is the inclusion of historical notes at the end of each chapter. This gives the reader a general view of just where the results came from, and encourages further reading on the subject. Anyone interested in functional and logical programming will gain a lot in the reading of this book, as it introduces the proper tools and methodologies used in these important programming paradigms."
2,works to well but looks bad,this stuff works too well. a small amount got on the window seal and when i came out the next day i couldnt get the door open. i figured that it was a good thing meaning this stuff worked then it rained and the stuff turned green and crumbled off the car the next day
2,Fugeddit,"Mafia potboiler with plots, plots within plots, double crosses, & lots of violence. Story starts with Ray, a Mafia bigwheel, being deported to his native Sicily. The rest of the overly long novel concerns his efforts to return to USA and regain his empire. Skip this one. You want Mafia -- reread ""The Godfther""."
3,Should be 3 1/2 stars,"The book was a nice adventure story for boys or girls, although more geared to boys because all of the main characters in both time frames were male. Going back and forth in time made for more interesting reading and there was an element of mystery about the characters from the past that made the reader want to keep going to see what really happened and to whom.The protagonist in the present was an adventuresome boy and I could imagine more stories of his exploits from the author. As an adult, I found the book a little simplistic and fairly predictable; still, I enjoyed the yarn and read it all. I think youngsters could picture themselves involved in this kind of exploration, doing a little detective work and trying to figure out some of the unexplained happenings."
1,Mindless Concoction,"Journalists find it easy to build fascinating stories around misunderstood science. This leads to serious consequences, but who cares? Catastrophe scenarios sell well and the misinformation disseminated to an unsuspecting public is not something the author will be accountable for. When writers without scientific training or comprehension take on complex issues such as global warming, the result tends to be a calamity as exemplified by this volume. It should be listed under 'fiction'.There are several excellent new books available on the topic, such as 'Global Warming in a Politically Correct Climate' and 'Geological Perspectives on Global Climate Change', both of which provide a scientifically correct view - even if it may not be politically correct. Science, thankfully, provides the truth of the matter irrespective of what is politically acceptable.It differentiates between objective reason and pure advocacy based on little knowledge an no scientific insight."
1,The pending global stupid storm,"Some day, we will look back at global warming as the Population Bomb of the 90's. Some people need a crisis to sell books, or get more money in federal grants, or become the Democratic nominee for president.Apparently 55% of our income isn't enough. Now they want our cars. As an alternative, I propose that all eco-nuts that use any form of energy commit suicide immediately. This will reduce greenhouse emissions by at least 15% (even more if we include the hot air these gasbags emit orally).If you agree with the premise of this book, please join in. With your help, we can whip this thing! But hurry! It's already hotter than last month! Oh... it's Spring. But still, it wasn't this hot last year. And besides, I read that Antartica has jillions of bucket-feet of melting ice. Penguins are dying and my rent-subsidized condo is sinking! Oh my GOlod-olblrlblr lrlbrl lrbalr! 0Ooo***::...."
1,This guy is a joke,If you want to read distorted facts then go ahead and waste your time. Otherwise stay away. Any respected organization will admit that Gelbspan is a joke.
1,Surprisingly biased polemic attacks scientific debate.,"I was surprised when I read this book that its arguments amounted to no more than serial ad hominem attacks on the motives of anyone who disagreed with the global warming hypothesis--this is advocacy journalism at its worst. As a scientist (and amateur climatologist), I would really like to have recommended this book, but the issues are not presented in a rational and balanced fashion. The people criticized here actually come across as far more impartial (read S. FredSinger or Patrick Michaels or Thomas Gale Moore) Try these titles::Climate of Fear : Why We Shouldn't Worry About Global Warming; Thomas Gale MooreHot Talk Cold Science : Global Warning's Unfinished Debate; Singer, et alSound and Fury : The Science and Politics of Global Warming; Patrick J. Michaels"
2,Uniden Radio Poor Performer,I bought 2 sets of these radios on clearance for 10 dollars a set. Used one set on a 4000 mile road trip to and from Yellowstone National park. I was able to use these radios on a variety of terrain from open road to deep mountain overpasses. These radios did not exceed 1 mile. When in range the voices are clear. I have an older pair of Motorola 2 mile radios with multiple sub channels. The Motorola's have a true 2 mile range. The batteries do not last very long as discussed in other reviews. I will be giving these radios to my nephews and nieces. I would not advise to purchase this pair of radio.
2,drinks energy as a black hole,"Four alkaline batteries do not last half hour of conversation. Energy consumption is very high.The scope of the signal in the open field, also did not exceed two miles."
2,This is a good start...,"These radios represent the cheapest possible solution. Do they work? Yes, for about a half mile direct and unobstructed line-of-sight. If you're looking for something reliable, that can work at the range advertised, this isn't it."
3,You only get one filter,"I thought that all retailers sold this part#32002 as a 2-pack, and in the picture they show 2 filters. But you only get one filter. It did come quickly and it is the correct size, but I was expecting 2 filters by the picture. Also this filter is not an OEM filter and is much thinner than the original, so time will tell if it works."
5,Worked Great!,I used this and it worked for my application very good quality and good pricing and also packaging. It's made well.
5,Great replacement for Nissan spill proof travel mug,"I bought these o-rings as a replacement on my Nissan spill proof travel mug. I use this mug all the time. It will keep a cup of freshly made tea or coffee hot for 3-4 hours if left closed, or at the right drinking temperature for a full hour. I tried to find a replacement for the o-ring at the Nissan website but could not. These o-rings are an excellent replacement. The mug closes water tight and works like new. Highly recommended for this application."
5,music,i love this band when i found it for so cheap in the used section i was concerned but when i received it it was in perfect condition
5,check it out.,"ok ok. I know lot of you people iut there are saying how dumb and idiotic this flick is. I got one thing to say about that. THAT IS WHAT MAKES THIS FLICK GOOD!! It is good to get away from the ""smart"" films and foreign stuff and just watch a totally mindless movie with friends and shout and yell at the screen. So what, it aint Magnolia, or Saving Private Ryan, but how many of those movies can you really stand? Sometimes you just wanna see major cities gettin blown away like a bottle rocket in an apple.(That's a funny visual, go ahead, visualize it.) So if you got the mula, go ahead and by the movie, i think you'll enjoy it."
5,This is why the DVD Special Edition format was created,"There have been many dissapointing ""Special Edition"" DVDs that have come out recently. ID4 does not fall into this category. From the audio commentary to the original ending (cleverly hidden in the menu of disc 2) to the 3 documentaries on the making of this film, this a great collector's item and a very enjoyable movie to boot. Besides, any movie that uses the words ""plausible deniability"" as a major plot point can't be all bad. Overall, a must have for fans of the movie and a must rent for anyone who has not had the pleasure yet."
3,It's OK...,"This movie is simply escapism, it's true. But what's wrong with that? I thought the movie was slow to start, the characters are stereotyped, the plot IS a rip-off of war of the worlds, but it's enjoyable to watch and Will Smith is pretty good. Not every movie has to be full of 'deep messages,' you know."
4,A must own DVD set.........,"I have not seen this movie since it was in theatres in 1996 because I was waiting for the DVD. Now its here and its better than ever! The extra scenes, though nothing major, are entertaining to say the least. It is mostly character development along with a couple of funny scenes. The picture is beautiful and the THX sound is what it should have been in the theatre! Whether or not you enjoyed this film, this DVD edition is well worth the money. It is filled with lots of cool behind the scenes documentaries, including the Fox special wich aired just prior to the films release. I highly recommend this DVD special edition to any and everyone! The film itself may not be that spectacular when examined closely, but this is still a very nice DVD set to own! The film on its own gets three stars, but the DVD set gets four stars."
4,Great popcorn flick,"Come on people. It's a great popcorn flick to while away (and waste two hours). The special effects alone make it worth the effort.Yes, there are gaping holes in the plot and science. Chief amongst them is the connection between Jeff Goldblum's computer and the mother ship. We can't usually connect two Earth laptops on the same platform. And assuming Jeff could connect with the alien network don't you think they'd have Norton Antivirus 3000?Ah well, kick back, pop in the DVD with 5.1, grab the popcorn and enjoy."
1,THERE IS NO DTS!,Just received this and it DOES NOT have DTS. Very disappointing. Nothing different or special about this edition. Do not waste your time.
2,Disappointing,"I remember when the previews came out, it looked like an amazing movie. When I went to see it in the theater, what started out mediocre went straight to ridiculous. I don't mind the occasional holes in a plot, but these are craters! Like when they give the aliens' computer a virus? Imagine the aliens running the same operating system as us! Or after they shoot the first ship down, wouldn't the aliens figure it out and prevent it? The list goes on and on. The plot becomes terribly cartoonish and juvenile to the point I was actually embarassed being in the theater watching it. I give it 2 stars for some of the special effects."
5,Great action movie,"One of the best Alien invasion action movies, amazing effects, great acting and an awesome story, highly recommended!"
3,Great Effects,"It was a great idea to put this movie on DVD. However it's production was not great at all. The sound effects and the visual effects were incredible. The supplemental disk was equally as good. The bad thing was that the voices are horrible. At some points the voices are really soft and you can't even pretend to make out what they are saying. At other points it's too loud and it fades in and out. There is also a scene where the frames stop completely and it really takes away from the mood. Overall this DVD could have been a lot better if it was produced better. Which raises the question, ""Why do you make something and not go over it?"""
3,"Big, Loud, And Stupid - the WWF of SF flicks","I wasn't going to buy this film, but finally decided, what the hey, it's time for something gratuitously stupid, and the DVD package offered som einteresting extras (and had a very positive rating for its technical qualities.)Well, it's big, loud, and stupid, as ever, and no matter that the special edition adds a few bits that help make some of the idiocy a little less idiotic -- this is not saying anything to complement the film, believe me. The key to enjoying this film is in sitting back and letting it roll over you -- Emmerich and Devlin mention THE TOWERING INFERNO as their inspiration, and it's easy to see. Remember, all those Irwin Allen disaster flicks appeared to have been made by people with oysters in place of brains. The greatest regret for me is that the destruction of Los Angeles isn't more prolonged (one of the key selling points of VOLCANO for me.)"
3,Problems on older Toshiba,"This Special Edition of ID4 will not play on a Toshiba 3108 that has not had a firmware upgrade. You will see a message stating, ""Please Check Disc."""
4,Still Enjoyable,"ID4 delivers the fun.You can still get the ""summer blockbuster"" goosebumps watching it again. Only the the most ardent fans will pick out the 9 min. of additional footage, until you view the theatrical version. The supplements were good. And a nice interface for the menus also. A ""must have"" for all Sci-Fi fans"
1,"Independance Day - If I could, I'd give it zero","Okay... I rented this expecting to watch a decent (at least decent, considering how much it cost) movie. Once I was through with it, I couldn't believe what I had just seen. I could go on forever about how bad this movie was. Featuring the dumbest lines in movie history, ( WOMP! "" Welcome to Earth! "" "" I'm Baaack!"" ) and some of the dumbest actions ever (let's upload a virus into the Alien computer!) this movie is just.. .... I mean, come on, they put the President in a jet. How stupid is that. And Will Smith is just horrible in this movie. This is your typical ""The world is in trouble, it's USA to the rescue"" movies, and is, in my opinion, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Just think of all the starving kids they could have fed by not making this thing. Instead, they waste tons of donatable dollars to give us this moronic waste of time. Pathetic. It's not 'I'll watch it to make fun of it' horrible, it's just plain HORRIBLE. Period."
1,What a stupid movie...,"This is one of the dumbest movies I ever seen. Not for the visual effects or the overall entertainment but for the hard to believe performances, the typical American clichés (flags everywhere, all of them are heroes, the president flying a jet fighter like an ace, a drunk guy who, suddenly salutes like a GI Joe and also flights a jet with no training, his kids watching him die and not even reacting, and so on...). As said, absolute crap."
1,Independence Day,"This DVD would not play, it appeared to be blank. The replacement DVD did not play either."
1,Can we pack ANY MORE CLICHES` IN ONE MOVIE?,"What a dud!There are literally scores of movies with brilliant Fx,so this one breaks no new ground i could see{having sat through it twice I feeL I deserve the Croix de Garbage}The cast is terrible,Will Smith is not too bad as the rah rah leader, Jeff Goldblum in another mailed in role, Bill Pullman,who usuall makes interesting movie choices,must have neede the money. The story is inane,the subplots are isipid,the score is even mundane. This movie is as bad as the Postman,and Waterworld[now There is a depressing thought},though it got better press and made much more at the box office[which for these folks,is all that counts}.Terrible!"
1,Rubbish,"Along with Reign of Fire and Star Wars ep1&2, this is the worst sci-fi film in the past 10 years.The worst thing about it is that the masses think its good (there are lots of them out there after all) - but if you've got any taste, you'll hate it!!!Stay clear of this tat - you have been warned!!!"
1,Fluffy and WEAK,"I thought this was going to be one of the greatest movies ever, after I saw the trailer way back when. I had no idea of the atrocity I was about to partake of. We were teased into thinking this was going to be an EPIC, COLOSSAL sci-fi adventure about aliens invading the earth. The scenes of those HUGE flying saucers were plain awesome. INSTEAD, what do you get? As silly, corny, fluffy, inane piece of GARBAGE that you could EVER hope to see. There are so many eye-rollingly bad pieces of dialogue, so many useless characters, so many moments where even one's suspension of disbelief is stretched too, too far. Call it a b-movie, this film has to rank as one of the greatest blown opportunities EVER. I HATED IT!!!"
1,"no plot, no surprise","The scenario (if any) is so predictable, the clichés so evident, it's hard not to fall asleep."
1,Absurd,"This is the worst piece of patriotic nonsense I have ever seen in my entire life. Not to mention having more plot holes than swiss cheese. A computer virus??!? C'mon.Would someone in Hollywood please actually write a somewhat logical first-encounter movie where the aliens aren't humanlike and don't use Windows or Macintosh compatible computers and fly spaceships that could have been designed by the Air Force in about 20 years? And while you're at it, come up with some dialogue that doesn't insult our intelligence over and over and over again.Oh wait, I guess that would be ""Contact."""
1,Terrible,"Along with Reign of Fire and Star Wars ep1&2, this is the worst sci-fi film in the past 10 years.The hype before the film made it out to be an epic, rather than the formulaic disaster and b-movie mix. There was no intelligent plot and no decent action scenes - just dogs being saved (what a relief when the world is lying in ruins).Will Smith was playing his fresh prince character as usual (but this time dressed as a pilot); Bill Pullman was completely miscast as an uncharismatic, boring, leader; Robert Loggia laughable as the general (he makes you think we'd be better of with a head of the brownies instead); to name a few.Stay clear of this tat - you have been warned!!!"
1,Hollywood!! STOP Making Movies Like This!!!,"This movie redefines the term ""awful"", and will have you cursing the makers of this movie for the two precious hours of your life they stole from you. Absolutely everything is simply terrible. The special effects are predictable, the acting is pathetic, and the script is insulting to anyone with an IQ over 50. Why! Why was such an obvious piece of ""you know what"" of a movie given the green light!? And why did it make so much money at the box office!? And why is there a need to release a second, Five Star, version of the DVD!? Please...I beg you...DO NOT buy this movie under any circumstances!! There are so many excellent movies out there that deserve your attention. Independence Day is NOT one of them!!"
3,Bare bones - does NOT include extended edition or alternate ending,"Just a quick review for everyone looking at the Blu-ray edition of Independence Day. While the picture and sound are fantastic, this disc does NOT include the extended edition, nor does it include the alternate ending. It does have commentary, but it's OLD commentary from a previous edition. (It references things like, ""gee - this looks different on video due to 30 frames per second"" which is completely irrelevant at 24fps 1080p HD.) Wait for the double-dip that's sure to follow eventually. In the meantime, hold on to your original ID4 special collectors edition DVD!"
4,I'm sure you've seen this by now,"but if you haven't it's good. I'd advise renting it instead of buying it, but whatever you like"
4,"Old idea, new twist","I may not be the only one who made this observation with this movie. I watched War of the Worlds (that invasion from Mars movie from the 50s) again recently, I saw so many parallels between ID4 and War of the Worlds. ID4 has many new twists though and an expanded story. Overall, ID4 endures as an excellent movie with good acting, superior special effects, and a compelling story overall."
1,This is not a parody!,"Possibly the most idiotic film of the past 30 years. The only redeeming moment is when Randy Quaid tells about being abducted by the aliens. But even there, following the pattern of absolute predictability, we have already guessed that he will not survive to the end of the film. After all, who is a better candidate to sacrifice himself, than some wretched drunk and misfit. Utterly dispensable."
3,Looses it's punch after a while!,"I remember watching this film the weekend it came out. The film blew me away with its special effects. I gave it 4 stars back then. After viewing it on TV, I have to admit the film lost some of it's magic. The storyline could have been much better in telling who these aliens were and where they come from. The ending is open ended which was a bummer. It's still entertaining enough to recommend. Just don't take it seriously!"
4,Great Feel Good Flick,"America has a new independence day. This is the story that is full of action, some romance, a little comedy and more action. By the time it concludes you're worn out and proud to be a human. Have fun and watch this fantasy?."
5,Good sci-fi.,"I love the 2 offsetting personalities played by Will Smith & Jeff Bloomberg. The hot shot fighter pilot & the nerdy scientist . At the end they both loosen up a bit & do things that they wouldn't have done earlier. I did feel that a couple of scenes were over acted, especially the part where the president gives his speech & the reaction afterwards. On the other hand I loved the scenes where Will Smiths girl friend organizes a group of survivors, finds the presidents wife,who is dying & takes them basically cross country to find help. A very fun sci-fi movie."
4,Classic,"I can't say much that the other reviewers haven't already said. This is a classic movie with aliens who want to take over the world, and the humans have to come up with something to stop them. The computer special effects for this movie are rather impressive, with a solid storyline and acting."
2,Disappointment,"Beware, the only reason this has 2 disks is the fact that the first one has 2 movies and 2 commentraries. The second disk is filled with mediocre extra featutes. Gets 2 stars on movie's merit only!"
2,I dont know about this blu ray,"I originally had it on dvd. eventhough I`m not in love with this movie, I still thought it would be a good addition to my blu ray upgrades. man I could very well stick with my dvd copy. I watch my movies on 140 inch HD projector, and compared to my other blu rays, this one is not much of an upgrade. dont get me wrong, it definitely looks better than dvd. but still not as crisp as I expected. there`s an overall softness to the picture. maybe it would look razor sharp on 42 inch tv. but at the screen I`m looking at, It`s unnaturally soft. some would blame it to the fact that the movie was shot 14 years ago, but I have other old movies which look exceptionally good. like The Rock, Braveheart, 2001, speed. I would recommend it for entertainment walue, but if you are looking for a demo picture material, look elsewhere. get some other movies with equal mayhem and destruction. like 2012. which looks extremely crisp"
4,just like I remembered it,"It's nice that I can watch in the original form or the remastered version with 9 extra minutes. But, I really couldn't tell the difference."
1,Audiences watched because everyone was watching it,Independence day relies on special effects to get by it has no story line of what so ever. I really don't about anyone else but I love to watch a film that makes sense and you just watch a story not one of these rediculous special effects movies where you are there so you can get you eyes flashed and become hearing impaired. Everyone once again copies everybody who saw this movie the only reason why it made so much money is because your next door neighbor was watching it so you felt like you had to see it to. People were forced into theatres by there friends and family probably because they wanted to be cool and say that they viewed this movie. I saw this flop and I think it stinks when I watched it I got bored and got irritated with the actors in the movie. Will Smith thinks he is the coolest thing in the movie and he just laughing to the bank for his paycheck and so are the other characters.
2,Disk defects,There were no picture and sound during playing at playtime = 40 min about 2 seconds everytime I play. I play with Samsung BDP-1400.
4,Awesome movie. Blu-Ray needs improvement,"This is an awesome movie! I just purchased a new Blu-Ray player (Samsung) and a 73-inch Mitsubishi projection TV. I'm in HOG heaven! This was the first Blu-Ray movie I tried out on the player.As far as the sound goes, I was blown away (7.1 surround system). For the video, well, it was great in most places, but some scenes were noticeably grainy, especially in the shadows. Other scenes, everything was perfect.Other than that, a great disc!"
3,An insult to all evil aliens out there!,"This film is good entertainment but very, very, very, very unrealistic! Mankind wins by implanting a computer virus into the alien mothership. Do you all really think that highly advanced alien technology would be vulnerable to a simple computer virus?? I really don't think so!! Anyway it's only a film so who cares? Bye."
4,Pure Cheese--In the best possible way,"This is without a doubt one of the cheesiest Sci-Fi movies I have ever seen+that is precisely what makes it so enjoyable. There are holes in the plot big enough to drive a starship thru,yet the film somehow allows you to ignore them+still have fun. Aliens travel millions of light years to destroy Earth+Jeff Goldblum brings them down w/a virus from his laptop--dont these people have Norton? The performances are excellent given the material--one of the reasons this film works is that the actors do not take themselves or the film that seriously. Bill Pullmans grand Independence Day speech is so hammy it should come w/a slice of pineapple. My advice is very simple:Turn your brain off+enjoy the ride."
2,War of the Worlds this isn't.,"Here is another example of a movie that can be mildly diverting despite its single-minded desire to pluck the brain right out of its audience's collective head. Big, loud, and VERY dumb, Independence Day does have some pretty cool aliens and some decent spfx scenes. However, it has so many lame one-liners that we are left to ponder whether we are watching a sci-fi flick or Amateur Night At the Apollo. Good actors are wasted in roles that are sketchy and cliched at best. The score is pretty bad as well; all noise and no emotion. Its sad to see so much money wasted on something so lousy. Perhaps films like this exist solely to entertain. Maybe the critics should just lighten up, shut off their brains and enjoy. But, then again, maybe we, as an audience, should stop pouring our time and cash into movies that are slapped together without a trace of thought or creativity. This is definitely one of them."
1,A classic piece of c#&%,I really don't know why this stupid movie is often referenced as great. It is so bad and unbelievable- even if you did believe in aliens- that it should only be remembered as embarrassingly bad. I suppose that it pushes the right stupid buttons that gets the fools going. I'll be better off with never hearing of this movie for the rest of my life.
4,One of Will Smith's better roles and watch it for special effects,"Independence Day is in my viewpoint one of Will Smith's better roles and I manly own it just for the special effects. For the time frame it was release at the special effects were quite stunning. I also enjoy the acting jobs of the other actors in the movie some very talented actors that have gone onto better roles in tv shows and movies. But if your looking for a good science fiction movie and a fan of Will Smith movies or in general a fan of his then you will like this movie. But like most people who have watched this movie you end up saying it's one of those you like it, love it, or don't. But for myself I will always keep it in my collection of action movies because no matter how much time passes it still impresses me to this day and it came out in 1996."
4,WHOA!,THIS IS REALLY AWESOME SCIENCE FICTION FILM I EVER SEEN. I LIKE THE PART WHEN ALIENS TRY TO DESTROY THE EARTH AND THE AIR FORCES BATTLE THEM FOR FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE DAY.
2,"Great Special Effects and Great Special Effects and er, um..","This supercharged War of the Worlds ripoff is worth seeing just for the special effects. It's the only reason to watch it. The acting is cartoonish at best, the plot twists and turns are absolutely ludicrous, the science is so way off it's comical. But, the really spooky thing about this 1996 movie, is the Empire State building being blown up, and people running through the streets away from the explosion. It presages (unintentionally of course) 9-11 and the Twin Towers.Watch that scene, and remember the news videos about the Twin Towers. It's unsettling, that a piece of directorial drek like Independence Day, can bring about strong emotional reactions, not because of its inept screenplay, but because it accidentally showed us a vision of a terrible future incident that would Really take place five years in the future."
1,Dumbest movie ever made?,"A movie by and for mental midgets. Stupid, illogical, and without a bit of concern for suspension of disbelief. I seriously wonder if a six year old didn't write the script. This movie's not just retarded, but also plain obnoxious, with all the oh-so-cool one-liners and oh-so-hip witticisms demanded by snotty teen-agers and truck-loving rednecks. One of the worst sci-fi movies ever made. If memory serves, the person responsible for this ultra-stupid stinkbomb has also assaulted us with 'Stargate' and 'Godzilla'- two other mind-bogglingly stupid movies. If Ed Wood were alive today, these are the sort of movies he would make. The creators of 'ID4' need to be hunted down and punished in some way."
3,Independence Day,"This is a fun movie at times but overall it is quite weak! The effects are amazing at times then extremely crappy at other moments! The acting is terrible, and the direction is not that strong. Overall this is and ok movie and will probably become a camp classic in the future (You know its true!)"
3,DTS ES 5.1 Sound Please!,It amazes me that when you spend millions of dollars on a movie that the sound is way down the line. The sound and picture go hand in hand. This movie would knock your socks off if the remastered it in DTS ES sound.
3,"Qualities of ""Independence Day""","What's hot is:-The air combat-The destruction(in some scenes)What's not is:-The title is kinda cheesy for a movie involving aliens-They don't show the aliens that much-It gets kinda lame after a whileWhat's strange:-Should'nt there be some ground combat against a whole rack of aliens?What's the final word:This is not as good as they say it is. There could at least been some more non-cheesy action, then maybe it would be better."
1,Lenticular Rip off Do not get OUT FOXED,This is a disgrace Lenticular means a different box cover. this is the first version of the movie. Get the 5 star collection.The same this for all the 6-5-07 fox releases. The Dummies at fox did not even notice that on predator is DTS but the new fancy cover say D.D.
2,Blu-Ray Version Suffers from Jittery Picture,"Reviews of the movie aside, I was disappointed to see that the transfer of this movie to Blu-Ray actually ""jitters"" up and down--and not just the earthquake-ish scenes where its supposed to do that. With a 1080 122"" screen, it's painfully evident: you can pause the movie and watch the entire picture bob up and down two or three pixels by scanning forward frame-by-frame. The shot where the shadow crosses the World Trade Center is a big offender, but you can even see it during the closing credits. It's almost as if the projector that was used to do the transfer couldn't hold the picture steady from one frame to the next. I have another 20th Century Fox movie that does this during the opening Fox fanfare (Ice Age), but the movie itself is perfectly fine since each frame there is computer animated. Movies from other distributors seem to be fine, but watching this one on a large home theater screen can quickly get annoying."
2,A movie without chemistry,"What do Will smith,jeff goldblum,judd hersh and bill pullman all have in common?Absolutely nothing,so why are they all cast in this movie together,who knows?Sure it has some spectacular special effects moments,but that doesnt save this dryed out plot and a cast who has seemed to be picked out of no where.All fine actor's in there own way,but this is just downright goofy at times.Also there is no reason what so ever that Randy Quaid should even be in this movie,sure he's funny but is that what the movie is really about,umm no.If you want real sci-fi go for alien's,even the comical moments in it are all better than the serious parts in this movie."
2,Pure dissapointment.,"One of the most dissapointing movies I've ever seen. I waited over 6 hours in line to see the sneak preview of this film. While initially excitited by the dope special effects, the movie quickly turns into mindless drool. I recommend the 1st 20minutes, but nothing after that."
2,It's the nineties and this is the best we can do?,"All right the first time I saw ID4 the effects had me awstruck... as they did to all of us. Beyond that? I found the movie a no-brainer and have to wonder what HG Welles thinks of the obvious rip off from ""War of the Worlds"". More than likely he's saying, ""what the hell am I doing in a coffin?!"" My fellow educated sci-fi lovers will recall a virus killed the martians in that book but this round it's a computer virus instead of a biological virus. Welles should get royalties!!!"
2,Cheesy,"This was a cheesy film. It was composed of 90% gratuitous, jingoistic ""patriotic"" BS.I mean, if you're going to make a movie on a theme, (aliens invade the earth), that has been done so many hundred times before, you need to have *something* original to work with, and this film has nothing."
4,Good movie still,"I loved it when it came out. Now my kids loved it too, it is a good decent movie from back in the day."
4,Today is our Independence Day,"Take the Fresh Prince, Lonestar from Spaceballs, and a bunch of aleins looking to kill the human race and you get ID4. The special effects reminded me why I thought Star Wars was so awesome when I first saw it. It was simply the fact that I've never seen that before and it set a new standard (like Star Wars) in the use of special effects."
5,Replacement dvd,"We watched the first dvd so much, that we had to replace it. Hopefully this replacement will last as long as the first one did!"
4,Fun! Fun! Fun!,Great movie in the theather and still a great movie in this format really happy that it was finally released on blu-ray love it!!!
4,will smith,Knows how to pick them. I like the movies he chooses to film. They have you feeling a wide range of emotions.
5,great movie at a great price,I have a list of good movies that I check once a week or so to see if they're on sale. I don't know if the HD version of this is usually only $10 but Independence Day was on my movie list and it was the cheapest by about 30%. $10 is an awesome price for an HD movie but especially for a good movie like this.
5,Classic sci-fi,"Good, old-fashioned Earth-against-the-bugs warfare. Once again, mankind fights off ""unbeatable"" odds. Great special effects, and I liked the way they mixed humor in with ""drama""."
3,Popcorn flick with one the usual cheesy plot holes,"All in all this film can be enjoyed if you don't expect too much from it. Yes, there are some pretty unrealistic moments, and one wonders when hollywood will start thinking about depicting computer technology with any sort of realism, but on the whole this film does what it sets out to do. If only it had set out to do more..."
4,ID4 still rocks!,"The time me and my dad went to go see Independence Day at the theaters in 1996, it completely blew me away! Now it's on DVD and it's almost as good as it was in the theaters. Even though it is a little cheesy and stupid in parts, the scenes where the White House and the Empire State Building gets blown to bits is just awesome! Bill Pullman and Will Smith put on a reasonably good performance and the special effects were probably ground-braking. If you don't have it yet, go buy it now!"
3,Earth Rules,"This movie can entertain, if you do not think too much about the details of its plot. The aliens are here supposedly for our natural resources. They are space nomads, as it were, moving from planet to planet, robbing their natural resources. Real barbarians. Of course, a civilization capable of such a technological feat would not need our natural resources to begin with. ALL of our natural resources put together are not nearly adequate to accomplish a fraction of such intergalactic travel. Well, this is a movie.The special effects are fantastic, the acting is OK. The plot is not very rational and largely derivative. At any rate, it's nice to know we can defeat vicious aliens, if they ever get here. Perhaps we can also defeat some social problems here on Earth. More independence from crime and violence would be an excellent start."
2,More summer money making crap!!!,"It had very good fx, but was a very stupid movie...like when Will Smith got into a dogfight with an alien craft and won(luckly), walks up to the craft opens the hatch and punches the alien in the face....it was a kids movie. why is it aliens always have arms, fingers,two eyes,one head, and its allways a round saucer...wish hollywood would make a real alien movie, the closest one so far was Alien 1. on another note I think aliens have already been here its just that we don't have the preception to understand, just like us walking over a blade of grass...."
3,Not your DVD Directors cut version,"As you would expect BR video quality is quite superb, with excellent detail throughout. However, I was very disappointed to discover that numerous scenes were cut from the movie including an entire subplot. The DVD Directors cut include a subplot of the boy becoming deathly sick. This entire plot was deleted. Also noticed a scene of the Alien craft in the hanger deck, where Jeff Goldblum was given a tour of the inside of the craft when they first arrived at Area 51. This scene was cut as well.If you already have the DVD Directors cut then keep it as a backup. The BR video / audio quality is superior but the Directors cut version makes the movie seem complete."
3,Leave reality at the door,"The first time I saw ID4 I hated it, but that's because I don't like having to suspend my belief in the laws of physics while watching an action movie (Bugs Bunny doesn't count). There are so many over-the-top stunts and inane plot twists that I couldn't get into the rhythm of the movie.The second time I watched this movie I already knew that it was stupid and I hated it, so I just sat back and watched the eye candy... And you know what.. I had a good time.If you can calculate a 15% tip without a calculator, check your brain at the door and disregard the flaws in computer science, political theory, fluid dynamics, and everything else and you'll probably enjoy this movie.If you think that aliens with the intelligence and technology to travel between stars can be outsmarted by Jeff Goldblum, this is the movie for you!"
5,Great when you turn your brain off & enjoy.,Go watch a Streep movie if you want real drama. Go watch Casablanca if you want a classic. Go watch The Longest Day if you want the multi-national approach. The movie doesn't apologize for being a flag waving comic book. I loved it for what it was....two hours of fun! Buy it if you enjoy this type of movie....don't if you want depressing drama staring the above.
5,B movie at its zenith,"In my humble opinion, too many people have taken ""Independence Day"" way too seriously. Yes, it's got every B movie cliche in the book, but I think/hope that that was the point! I view this as a comedy, not science fiction. Everyone and everything was over the top (particularly Brent Spiner), but in a wonderfully delicious way (ditto Spiner). It's a movie to howl at, not believe! Just think of it as a story about urban renewal, Godzilla-style, and you'll be fine."
5,Excellent Sci-fi!,"One of the great sci-fi movies of our time, ID4 Independence Day is a roller-coaster ride of a movie. Action, Adventure, Humor, Romance, you name it this movie has got it. Anyone that thinks this movie stinks does not deserve the honor of being a movie fan. It is an excellent and powerful ride of a movie. It's even better widescreen"
1,where is it?,"ordered this and others on Feb 5th, now Feb 25th, where are they? This is ridiculous. Very late now for b-day presents.....ahhhhhhhh"
1,is there a number lower than zero?!?!?!?!?,"people took this nonsense seriously?!?!?!?!?!?and are giving this ''rave reviews''(must be somehow connected to the film or the participants themselves......)NO UNBIASED PERSON WITH AN IQ ABOVE A ROCK can HONESTLY SAY this deserves more than the obligitory lowest 1 star.did the fresh prince really get into a spaceship.................AND FLY IT?!?!?!?!?BETTER THAN THE ALIENS?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?look,far be it for me to tell YOU what you liked or didnt like,BUT I,MYSELF USE MY BRAIN WHEN WATCHING A MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!movies this feeble really should be for the preteens to fawn(go gahgah)over.....ANYONE OLD ENOUGH TO GET A LEARNERS PERMIT SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES FOR LIKING THIS NONSENSE!!!!!NO EXCUSE!!!!!!!!!!!and guess what,those same dunce cap models loved the equally pathetic WAR OF THE WORLDS(why wasnt the fresh prince in this?!?!?!?!?LMMFAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)"
1,"Ah, to be 12 again",...and enjoy crap like this. I'm afraid I just can't do it anymore. It makes me shudder to think people my age might have thought this was worth watching. Gives one notions about the intellectual decline of the US (not that it was much to start with).
1,Not at all faithful to the novel,"I stopped watchng after half an hour. The screenplay is literally unrecognizable to those who have read the novel - I am frankly surprised that Richard Ford let this movie be made at all. Far worse even than ""Adaptation"" on that account.Worse still, no sign of the Bruce Springsteen title song anywhere on the DVD. What a total ripoff."
1,independent day,I recieved a copy to replace a damaged dvd that was sent to me.The second copy did not work any better. In fact it stopped playing in the exact same place the original dvd. It freezes up and can not shutdown. I am very disapointed and have given up trying t oget a good working copy.
2,Don't you have anything better to do?,"If you thougtht 3,000 Miles to Graceland is a viloent film then you must not have seen Independence Day, which I can't believe they bother to make this movie. 3000 Miles to Graceland got a R rating, while this movie got a PG-13 rating. Besides violence, this movie scif-fi destruction and there also language in this mvoie, that some how did the MPAA missed? The movie stars Will Smith and Bill Pullman as President Thomas J. Whitmore. Harvey Fierstein from Mrs. Doubtfire, whom I regonized by his voice in the film. The movie also has a few famous buldings/landmarks. And the three are the White House, The World Trade Center and the Stuate of Liberty. This might make a good film to watch if you love violent movies, or you love the country of USA. But please look at other film instead of this one. The dvd case, says this movie runs 153 mintues, but it clocked at 2 hours and 24 minutes."
2,Big-budget mediocrity,"This is a pretty simple flim to sum up, to wit: it is dumb and loud. Its appeal is pretty limited, and it really isn't worth owning unless you are just looking for ways to burn up money. It isn't a horrible film like Starship Troopers, but is just a mediocre popcorn flick. I like action and sci-fi movies, but Independence Day is just not that good."
1,Won't work in Europe!,"I ordered this BluRay from Germany, but unfortunately it won't workin my BD Player (PS3) because it proteced with a stupid region Code.Now what sense does it make to protect BluRays that are also available in Europe and partially older releases?Well, be advised european customers, DO NOT buy this BD unless your player can handle it (there is only very few)..."
3,The world gets blowed up real good! Enjoy!,"Let's face it...""Independence Day"" is about as mindless an entertainment as you can get, but it IS entertainment, and it works beautifully on that level.""Independence Day"" is like a 1970's disaster flick with $50 million in F/X. Things get blowed up real good indeed...so good, in fact, that the movie loses a LOT of steam after things stop getting blowed up.Still, ""Independence Day"" is a lot of fun, and features some funny performances (especially Will Smith, who actually trash-talks one of the alien invaders as he drags him across the desert).But the point of this movie IS watching things get blowed up real good.And that it does well."
1,CHEEEESY!!!!!!! not to mention that it stinks,Sure the special effects were good and the story had A LOT of potential but they had to ruin it with bad acting by some minor characters and cheap jokes for the kiddies and extremely overused cliches. This movie would have become one of the biggest movies if it had only been rated R and directed towards adults.
1,"Fun movie, HORRID transfer","This is easily one of the worst transfers to DVD I have ever seen. Good sound, generally good picture, but the film 'artifacts' (that is, the picture becomes jumbled, broken up, and stops completely) during high-action sequences, like the massive dogfight against the evil invading aliens.While this is not a problem with newer players, owners of older machines will find this film almost unwatchable.Do yourself a favor, and buy the widescreen VHS instead."
1,No Macintosh Support on this DVD,"The Extra Features on this DVD require a Windows PC and will not work with a Macintosh. I guess we can bring down a whole Alien Spaceship in the movie with a Macintosh, but support the Macintosh on the DVD? - I guess that was asking too much!"
1,The worst sci fiction movie I have seen since Ice Pirates.,"What a joke of a movie, it only got good attendance because of the special affects. It stunk when it came out and it still stinks. Overacting, bad lines, and stupid plot. Example it took 2 weeks to train civilians to be f-18 fighter pilots. Harry Connick Jr is a joke of an actor. Will Smith is over rated and over acts. Like how the alien space craft they hijacked had seats made for humans and not the aliens that have no legs or butts. Terrible movie, but what do you expect from the makers of Godzilla and 10000 BC."
1,horrible movie,I've never understood the success of the movie. It has no script and nothing that approaches the storytelling elements of the great special effects films of a Speilberg or Lucas.
2,An Obvious Crowd-Pleaser,"I saw this piece of work in the theaters, and at the time I thought it was okay. Seeing it for the second time here made me reconsider. This movie blows. Sure, there's plenty of action, and little else. Will Smith plays a fighter pilot, Jeff Goldblum a computer expert, and Bill Pullman plays the President in this film. This movie, in which aliens invade the Earth, cannot be called science fiction. Science fiction is Star Wars, 2001, and Starship Troopers. This movie does do exactly what it set out to do. The special effects are incredible, the sound is extremely good, the alien ships do look, alien. On the other hand, the aliens themselves are laughable, as is the ""plot"", which should make comic-book writers shudder. Pancake characters round out this film that was so successful the first time they are selling it again so that the company can get more cash to make more movies like this. So if you want an post-lobotomy action movie, you've come to the right place."
4,A Red State Smash,"Some films are important because they are original & imaginative. Others are important as they epitomize a culture, an era, etc. I remember Bob Dole liked this one. Alien space ships hover. Those stoopid flower children actually try to greet them on the roof. BLAM!! Ha Ha Ha. Every red state housewife with her apron on would say, ""Of course aliens would kill us & get what we have to take to their own families!"" Foreigners! I visualize the American Gothic couple - they hear footsteps approaching - they blast their rifle into the fog."
5,This time they are not friendly...,The story is a little weak in some places but it is a solid one. I won't go into the storyline as dozens of people before me have already done that. This however is one of the better bad guy alien movies...
3,Just Fun,"WHY YOU SHOULD VIEW THIS:This movie does not take itself at all seriously and understands that its sole purpose is to entertain. The action sequences are superior and effectively convey a massive sense of scale. It has the same intellectual value that cotton candy has nutritional. It will satisfy a craving and is fun every so often, but will not fill you up or sustain your health. If your diet consists of nothing else, your teeth will fall out and you will die. Films such as these will have the same effect on your imagination. Have fun, enjoy them when you can, but do not subsist on them.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM"
4,There are superheroes among us,"This is easily my alltime favourite alien-invasion-movie. Besides the normal screaming and running, it contains some great realistic portraits of humankind. Compared to a so called 'intelligent'movie like signs, i thought this could actaully happen. In Signs, they think logical behaviour is locking yourself in the basement and be so lucky that aliens don't know how to open doors. In Independence day, people are plundering eachothers houses, starting fights, getting all in the same traffic jam... Of course, there are always those superheroes, one of the strong type and the more intelligent type, but Jeff Goldblum is always terrific to watch. On the whole, this is a pretty intelligent movie with some realistic aspects and also just great special effects, can't wait to see The day after tomorrow."
5,Excellent video - excellent seller,"Enjoyed this movie for years on VHS & decided to get the DVD. Great movie - well written, acted, & produced. A true classic film! Excellent seller, as well. Great to do business with!"
5,Best version ever,"I perfer this version cause it is more features and more of the film. I has about 9 extra mintues of movie yeah the price is kinda of a bad one, but you get what you pay for."
3,Good character developments & acting. Special effects were good at that time but not good compared to movies of the last 4 years,It has good character developments and acting. The special effects were good at that time but not good compared to movies of the last 4 years. It's worth watching.
4,Very entertaining,I am first going to award stars on different areas in the film and do a comment on eachACTING: 4 stars. The acting was very good in this film. Each actor and actress could depict the extreme personality of each characterREALITY: 1 star. Need I say anymore? This film was totally unrealisticENTERTAINMENT: 5 stars. Excellent entertainment.THEME: 5 stars Excellent
2,A five star movie for morons,"But it's a two star movie for me. Hollywood serves up a big old helping of stupidity for it's audience. Don't you people feel insulted when moviemakers assume you are so stupid that they can write a plot like this movie has? If you keep paying to watch movies that pander to the lowest common denominator like this movie does, they will continue to make such pabulum.How can you people give this movie 5 stars? That is the problem with Amazons rating system, people give anything they like a 5 star rating. This movie is not a 5 star movie."
2,"I'd give it a ""1,"" but then what would I give Stargate?","When I think of awful science fiction movies, three come to mind. Plan 9 From Outer Space, Stargate, and this ""gem."" Written to the lowest common denominator, and unintentionally hilarious, this is as bad a science fiction movie as you can make with a hundred million dollar budget--except, perhaps, for Stargate.Want to learn how not to write a screenplay? What bad dialogue sounds like on screen? How to insult the viewer's intelligence? It's all here.Will Smith can add this to his ""bad"" movies column, right next to Wild, Wild West (ugh). Rent this just for a laugh if you're a glutton for punishment."
2,Good effects ... PAINFULLY bad story.,"Ready for a no-brainer? This is the movie for you!Put it in, crank up the speakers, and try to suppress your gag reflex.Effects? Yup...real good.Casting? Poor. You will lose your respect for most if not all of this cast after seeing this. What a waste (and miscast) of Jeff Goldblum. I can't watch Bill Pullman anymore because of this movie. And Brent (Spiner), you're so much better than this...Acting? They do the best with what they were given.Script? YIKES! Pure Hollywood trash. One silly (and yet painfully predictable) turn after another. I actually like a lot of big-budget Hollywood movies, but this movie deserves the bad rap that blockbusters often get.So if you unwisely decide to invest in this movie, prepare to suspend your disbelief like you never have before..."
1,The real Dumb and Dummer!!!!!!!!!!,It is simply one of the most unimaginable things I have ever seen. It amazes me how people loved this movie.I don't want to waste my time going into detail what I hated about this movie because the film is only indicative of a larger problem.If you don't know what this problem is then perhaps this is the film for you.
1,Horrifically bad movie,"This movie suffers from poor acting by all involved, worse scripting, and even worse concept. This movie lends new meaning to the term ""implausible,"" and it is so utterly bad that it is impossible for the viewer to engage in the temporary suspension of disbelief. Boo.Too bad, because I like Will Smith on the sit-coms that he has starred in, but I don't believe that motion pictures is the next logical step for his career. I think he should stick to TV."
1,Humanity ought to be destroyed for a movie like this!,"If aliens with intelligence greater tha Roland Emmerich (which we can safely assume would be the case...) ever visited the Earth and encountered movies like Independence Day, they would fire their fusion reactors and get the hell outta here. I only hope this will never happen because humanity deserves to be destroyed for making films like that."
4,Superficial Fun,"During the summer of 1996, a movie came to the silver screen which was the pinnacle of a long line of bad scifi movies and pointless blockbusters--Independence Day. Let's face it, folks. This movie is cliched and corny at times but, hey, it's cool! A lot of people didn't enjoy this movie, and my only explanation for that is simply that they don't understand that this is intended to be nothing more than the superficial 2 hours of entertainment that it is. It isn't Star Wars, and it wasn't intended to be. As long as you understand that and can appreciate stupid, fun, action-packed movies, then you will like this movie. The 5-star DVD release is excellent (they ought to release classics with special editions like this), but the single-disc editions are not. If you are going to buy ID4, be sure that you are buying the 5-star edition. This movie gets 3 1/2 stars, and an extra half star because of the excellend DVD treatment. Bring out the popcorn!"
3,"Stupid, brainless movie - but fun to watch.",The plot is a complete rip-off of the War of the Worlds (even down to a virus saving the day) and steals things from a lot of other sci-fi movies. The dialog is so corny that it is laughable. The characters are hoakey stereotypes. The plot is so improbable and contrived that the screenwriters should be embarassed to show their faces. But..... I've seen this movie about 10 times and enjoy it each time. I had the laser disc and now have the DVD. For all of it's flaws its a fun movie to watch and the effects are outstanding.
2,Blu-Ray botch-up,"After watching the first twenty minutes of this film I had to eject the disc. Having watched the DVD countless times, there is a natural progression of the plot. The Blu-Ray version seems to have thrown all cohesion out the window in favor of god knows what, by deleting multiple scenes. These scenes assist in character development.It just amazes me that here we have 30+GB of space on Blu-Ray, plenty THEY SAY to have all sorts of extra content, but not the whole movie?I gave it two stars because I just can't force myself to give one of my favorite movies a single star.I suppose a few years from now a ""Limited"" edition Blu-Ray will pop up with those missing eight minutes..."
2,A huge disapointment,"The movie has great special effects. I guess this is where all the money went while making the film. I say this because its pretty obvious that no money was spent on hiring competent writers. The subplots in the movie are pretty stupid, the characters look confused on screen, and the movie borrows from so many other science fiction stories that one wonders why the producers weren't sued. Oh yeah, Randy Quaid's character was pretty useless, except until the end. Even then, it was kinda obvious what was going to happen. Come on people, when you attack a ship that is several miles across, don't you think convential weapons may not be able to bring it down. How stupid do they think their audience is."
3,A perty good flick but....,"This was an excillant film the first time I saw it. I left the theatres saying wow this was great! only I saw it again. that was my mistake. the film seems to loose alot after seeing it more than once or twice, for sure not worth it to own."
4,The ultimate roller coaster ride,"Good kicks evil's butt, planet gets saved and the good guys get the girls. I liked this one in the theaters, I liked it on VHS, and I still like it now that it's on DVD. Formulaic, maybe, but it's a formula that's worked since Moses let the Exodus."
3,"""Must go faster, must go faster!""","Dumb as hell, knows it, and pushes so many glee buttons that only the most tiresome intellectual manques will resist. Each time I watch this my attention moves from Will Smith's performance (especially after seeing 'Wild Wild West') to Jeff Goldblum who deserves an Irving Thalberg career Oscar for finding so many variants within the role of ""scientist"". Every Goldblum line reading has something to squirm about, none of them normal. And then there's his strut at the end that threatens to knock down Will Smith if he gets too close. Complex. The bonuses are okay, and there are a lot of them. But really, it's a mediocre movie, how much into the filmmakers' minds do you want to travel? Many of the short features repeat footage. The commentary by Devlin & Emmerich is funny, though. If you're bold enough to consider buying the movie, go ahead and get this package with the extras and admit only to close friends that you have become a scholar of a big, bad, fun film."
4,Enjoyable 2 hours,"This is an excellent way to spend the evening. There is nothing overty thrilling, or thought provoking about this movie. It was not written to be Apocalypse Now, nor was it intended to be Hot Shots. In Independence Day, some items are handed to you that are a little difficult believe, and if you want to know what they are, read some of the other reviews. I don't care. If Hollywood wants me to believe a MAC can control an Alien computer, fine. This is a fun movie with good action, and a happy ending, and some of the best ""One-liners"" to come out of Hollywood since Aliens. Sit back, grab a drink and some popcorn, and enjoy your evening. I know I will."
4,Best special effects in a movie so far,"Okay okay, so it is all about the effects but isn't that the point of these films?!If you aren't interested in seeing what it would look like if huge spaceships descended on famed capital cities and blew them to pieces, then how we fight back, don't see the movie. I think all movies are good for what they are...and ID4 has some of the best effects I have ever seen in a movie - ever.I have watched the film quite a few times and still get a thrill out of seeing the Empire State building blasting from inside out and walls of fire engulfing numerous cities. I thought the idea of tieing in the famous Rosewell incident was quite clever.I'm sure this movie provided some inspiration for the several following disaster films of the late 90s.If you want to sit back, relax and enjoy an evening dazzled by spectacular effects, the odd bit of humour and on-going action then definitely watch this movie."
2,Mediocre Science Fiction Film,"This is one forgetable and spectacular Hollywood product more. ""Independence Day"" would seem be made for showing up Will Smith and company only. Producers's main purpose was to dazzle audience with ethnocentral and pseudopatriotic content in this movie"
2,"Entertaining, but not as good as the older similar movies","I personally liked the older movies, to which this one was compared, much much more. It was full of special effects, but aimed toward the lower age groups, I believe. Entertaining is about all I can say for it, but if you miss it, you'll live! If you are looking for something to fill time, this one is probably a good bet."
2,bad science fiction,"Independence Day has got to be one of the dumbest sci-fi films to ever be released. All the characters are one-dimensional. We hate Bill Pullman's portrayal of the president so bad, we wished he'd died in the White House. Will Smith provides almost no comic relief, although he is the movie's one likable character. I find it rather stupid that the world was saved by a Macintosh computer. The filmakers of Independence Day obviously didn't learn their lesson as they later made the even worse, very corny, Godzilla. The only thing that prevented me from giving Independence Day one star were the visual effects. They were quite astonishing, especially on a 75 million dollar budget."
4,Independence day,"I am a Japanese university student and I watched ""Independence day""This movie is about big space ship like ""U.F.O"" that come and attack earth. American fighters must stop the aliens. It is a SF,action movie.I thought the movie was exciting and sad because the big space ship is so real and this story is very exciting and sad. At the last scene, the man who abduction onece time thrust into big space ship.I would recommend this movie because this movie is very exciting."
4,"Good effects, but poor knowledge of military customs.","I liked the story line and the special effects; they had the desired effect. What put me off was the knowledge of military custom and training.(1) A Marine would not call another Marine a ""soldier.""(2) A jet pilot would not have a clue how to fly a helicopter; there is no cross-training. It costs too much to train; cross-training is not efficient.(3) A Marine would not salute without a cover on (""hat,"" to you civilians) under any circumstances. That means anytime indoors without special circumstances.Other than those things that directors could find out but are too lazy to, this is a good film."
1,Are special effects all we have today?,"I remember going to the movies to see this. I was excited to see it, but once the film got going I felt like asking for my money back!Special effects are great now, but the stories and characters seem to get lost with mindless explosions and effects that just can't stand on their own.Ever watch the old Twilght Zones? The Day the Earth Stood Still? Laugh if you will at the effects, but the stories behind them still hold up today.I like alot of the actors in this film, but whoever gave the greenlight for this movie should be ashamed."
2,Disengage brain before operating,"You're going to love this movie if:1) You like explosions2) Head-butting an alien is your idea of humor3) You know absolutely nothing about computers or dataYou'll also probably like it if you're able to completely suspend your thinking processes during viewing.The acting's not bad, and the effects are top-notch. Too bad the story is so inane.It would be pretty stirring if the solutions to the plot complications weren't so ridiculous. Everything was fine for the first hour. The closure to the film was just slack-jaw goofy.I find it hard to believe that there are many people who haven't seen this very hyped film, but if they exist, I recommend you leave this one one the shelf. If you want to see an action movie with humor that is worth suspending your brain for, rent ""Big Trouble in Little China""."
3,PICTURE QUALITY IS VERY BAD!,I thought this DVD will have the works well apart from the fact that it has all the behind the scenes info and additional footage and stuff but the picute quality is awful.I have a flat screen tv at home and I had to go into different modes in colour settings for about 20 minutes before I was satisfied.It is as though they have used a direct LD transfer without clearing anything.I know this will not stop anyone from buying this movie but I was really annoyed about the image resolution.
3,ID4 Review,"A guilty pleasure. Leave your brain at the door. It's showing its age, perhaps its the nostalgia but it was enjoyable."
2,"WHEN YOU REALLY, REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THE DISHES","The effects are great, the acting is about what you'd expect, the story's a zero. If you have something that has to be done and you've already used up all the good excuses, uncork a jug of (cheap)wine, get out the chips and dip and ask wifey if she'd like to take a break from her hard labour.If you remember what a disappointment Erwin Allen movies always were and how you somehow sat thru them anyway, you know what you're in for.Like Irwin Allen, there was enough money to make this turkey pleasent to watch, there is some good acting, but whenever logic gets in the way of plot, forget the logic.(...Other than getting to spend some time goofin' off with the wife, maybe doing the dishes would be better)"
1,One of the most overrated movies of the past 10 years!!,"This movie, first off is way too long and could have easily been trimmed into an hour and a half. Don't waste your time. Second, I understand that it is a fictional story with the aliens and all, but many of the ""realistic"" scenes in the movie were far from realistic. For instance, when the President escapes from the White House, it appears that he is going through fire, which, obviously no plane would survive through a fire. Bottom line- don't waste your money. There are far better space related movies out there!"
2,Sound gets 5 ?,"Allright, check your brains in at the door because where this movie takes you it'll be a liability. Aside from that, portions of the movie are humorous and there is even some good cinematography in certain places. The characters are likeable but completely unrealistic except for Judd Hirsch who is simply horrible. All its faults aside, this movie is a great way to kill off a couple of hours. I never did figure out why the alien in area 51 was so quick to announce his clan's intentions rather than lulling the government into a false sense of security. Then again why should that bother me, it's perhaps the smallest hole in the plot.What really stinks on this DVD though is the audio. I was supremely dissapointed by the lack of quality. Compared to the Matrix it is garbage and compared to many other movies it's plain bad. Frankly, this has been one of the most unimpressive audio efforts on DVD in recent memory."
1,DISC2 of Indepandence day can not be played,"This DVD has 2 discs. But Disc2 can not be played my DVD player which is a SONY DVP-S560D. Soon after disc2 is inserted, power of the DVD player becomes off every time. So, I tried one more disc2 again and again but I have the same result. After all, I have not ever seen the contents of disc2. Therefore, I can not recommend this DVD because of this disc2 malfunction. Only disc1 is available even if this DVD has 2discs."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,"I have always been a bit of a sci-fi geek but this movie just plain stinks. The script is BAD, acting is BAD (Will Smith, Jeff Goldbum -- both terrible actors IMO -- walking all cocky like George Bush Jr., arms drawn at their sides like wild west cowboys that just smoked the evil-doer aliens). What a total bunch of American Hollywood garbage at it's ABSOLUTE WORST!! It's not even entertaining in a 50's sci-fi kind of kitchy way, it's just a sad waste of time that will leave you wishing you hadn't wasted your Sunday afternoon watching such garbage, mowing the lawn would be more interesting. I wonder how in %^$# they ever get the funding to make &*^$ like this when so many decent films can't even get made."
1,Please shoot me before they make a sequel,"Will Smith is quickly establishing himself as the king of commercial (movies). (Wicky) Wild Wild West and his heavily sampled music albums are just a couple of examples of his ""full sale"" entertainment career. Independence Day is at the top of the (junk)heap. All they needed was a schmaltzy Aerosmith title track to make this movie the perfect steaming pile. This is American movie making at it's worse."
1,Huge disappointment--a very bad movie!,"I'm sorry, but this movie was ridiculous! A drunken pilot saves the world from an alien invation!?! It takes one person two minutes to figure out how to operate an alien spacecraft??! President goes to fight in a war against unknown beings??! Let's get real here! If it weren't for the special effects this movie would be pure garbage! None of it makes any sense and it is totally unrealistic. It was a terrible disappointment to see good actors in such a lousy movie - in my opinion it diminished their 'image' somewhat. That movie taught me to think twice before ever looking at another Roland Emmerich movie."
1,Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?,"The plot holds as much water as a sieve, and the charcters are as well-defined and developed as a drawerful of sock puppets, but the explosions are mighty gratifying. In hindsight, it wasn't worth the $7.50 for big screen hoo-ha at the local multiplex, and it's even a questionable rental, if you're having to pay more than $1.Can't wait to see this one on MST3K."
1,One star too many,"This was, possibly, the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The film lacked a convincing plot throughout. The acting was poor to trite at best. And, the special effects were an awe inspiring waste of resources, money, and time.I'd much rather watch an Ed Wood film...on ""special edition""."
3,"good the first time, but dvd doesn't help it","This is a movie that is fun and funny the first time you see it. But after that, it is just plain stupid. I thought dvd would help the film, but sorry to say it does not. If you have already seen this film, then forget about it. It is not worth buying."
2,Awful,"How can anybody find this film good? To me it ranks in the vein of Stargate, another good idea which was poorly executed. They both had the same net result though - a disaster. Bill Pullman was entirely unconvincing as the President; however, he was still ahead in the credibility stakes to the Military advisor, played by Robert Loggia (why not just cast Ernest Borgnine or George Kennedy instead?). This film would have been a flop if not for Will Smith's performance. Whereas the rest of the cast seemed to take the weak script too seriously, Smith's smooth-talking wise-cracks added some well needed relief to the proceedings. But casting aside, the plot was ludicrous, I won't go into too many details but I think the IBM compatible Alien computer and the dog saving incident (who cares when millions of people are dying?) were hilarious. I eagerly await a decent 'Aliens attack the Earth' film."
5,To anyone who does not know what film making is all about,"Independence Day is an excellent film, I don't know how anyone can give bad comment on a film like this. Ok, so the story line is very basic, but it does have excellent special effects and the film is put together quiet well. I know what some reviewers are saying, same old movie (alians invading earth)etc. Ok this may be true, but use your tiny brains in your head and think about it, are'nt are films made this way, these days, almost all films are copied, or are very similar to each other, all you need to do is give out some imagination.An excellent film, I'll recommend this film to anyone who likes sci-fi.Oh one more question, how can anyone review this film on DVD, if it isn't available yet!, unless their buying pirated DVD's, if this is the case, you don't deserve to own DVD."
1,it really deserves zero stars!,"trite, unbelieveable, predictable, overrated, mindless Hollywood garbage. Will Smith once agains proves he has no talent. the movie is aimed at pre-adolescents and anyone else who has the brain of one. most Americans will love this since it formulated for their mental capabilities: gum-chomping, mall-inhabiting morons. if this description fits you, well, sit back and enjoy! if not, don't waste a minute of your time with this waste of film."
1,Yaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"What a yawnfest! I'm not surprised Americans would get worked up about the White House being blown up but talk about projection! The US is the most aggressive nation ever. So, small wonder it would be the ultimate threat if an alien army attacked the US.In other words, it is perfectly ok for the US to attack any country but heaven forbid if anyone, human or alien, attacks the US.Dull plot, dull everything, no amount of special effects can make up for that."
2,Independence Day,Movie is entertaining but Blue Ray transfer dissapoints! Not very much difference from the DVD.
3,A B-Movie with a big movie budget,"A former co-worker of mine used to say that this film was really just a B-Movie that had a big budget, and I have to agree. I was psyched to see this film when it came out, having shades of ""War Of The Worlds"" and ""V"", but was ultimately disappointed in what turned out to be an unintelligent film with a ""you gotta be kidding me"" ending. A big departure from their previous film, ""Stargate"", which was in many ways a polar opposite. ""Independence Day"" is entertaining if not taken seriously.The DVD also includes commentary by producers/writers Dean Devlin and Rohland Emmerich. Each of them says ""This is my favorite scene"" about 3 times each, and Emmerich sounds like he learned English in the valley (""Like, y'know, this is, like, my favorite scene, y'know?"").Not a bad way to spend 2+ hours, but not the best either."
4,What is the backlash?,"What is with all the one stars?This doesn't pretend to be a Sundance entry...it's just one heck of a good time. Lighten up, appreciate it for what it is and is meant to be, and enjoy."
4,Must have!,This DVD is a must have for home theatre enthusists. The sound is great. The move is much the same as it ever was. Weak story but good special efects. Its just a fun move that just about anyone can enjoy.
4,A Classic summer blockbuster,"Okay, it's not Shakespeare. But there's something about sitting in a cool dark theater on a hot summer day, watching big budget special effects. ID-4 is as much a thrill-ride as a movie, and by those standards it succeeds wonderfully! Many people pick on the plotline. I actually found it clever how Devlin/Emmerich & company managed to take so many movie cliches, toss them into the blender, and come up with the mother of all summer movies: this fast moving, expertly paced explosion-thon. The extended edition adds a few extra character scenes which don't slow the movie & add an occasional tweak to grab the attention of fans who thought they saw it all before. The bigger/better your home theater system, the more you (and your neighbors!) will get from this DVD. Turn down the lights, put on some popcorn, lower the A.C. and crank up the volume! Enjoy!"
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT TO GOOD","I think Independance Day was a good film, but again it could of been better, for a start who in there right mind would send the president of the USA up to fight in a plane against an almost invincible opposition, also will smith again plays not a good part but a cheesy part, and he's has got a habbit of getting these parts ( MEN IN BLACK) another rubbish exscuse for a film. But at the end of the day this film had to be made eventually, but even i could have made a film with alot of potential like this one that little much better. Overall it's a good family film, but it's not a film i could watch over and over again, and i don't think anybody in there right mind could either."
3,"Fun, could have been much better","It's a comic book with great special effects and lots of one-dimensional characters that are incredibly annoying or incredibly dumb. you may find yourself rooting for the aliens just so they'll wipe out Judd Hirsch's character. It was an O.K. adventure that should have been quite a bit better. I don't put it in the league of ""War of the Worlds"" or ""The Day The Earth Stood Still."""
2,what a brainless movie!,"this is an ok movie, the FX are great, but the characters are thin as paper. And there were some parts that really didn't add anything to the plot. For example, the presidents wife dying. And does anyone out there honestly believe that someone wouldn't prevent the president from risking his life? its just not realistic. but then again, the entire plot isn't realistic come to think of it. A piece of fluff, but an entertaining piece of fluff I suppose. The acting isn't that great either. The acting on the part of everyone is overdone."
3,Only in the theaters,"Unless you have a THX certified surround sound system, a huge widescreen television, and the repo man isn't banging on your door because the check bounced :) don't get it. ID4 is one of those movies you have to see in THX at the biggest theater in town. I saw it in true Lucasfilm THX at a fairly large theater and it was awesome. I loved it so much I went downtown to the rat infested Dolby stereo theater and it stunk (not just the seats). The home video doesn't do any better.If you missed it in the theater, you missed it. It's like Star Wars. Star Wars is good on TV/VHS, it would be good if they put it on DVD (!), but it is pure magic in the theater. Any movie that is based on the special effects (Star Wars does NOT fall into that category mind you), is only good in the theater.Trust me. Only die hard fans of the movie should buy it."
4,Enjoy it for what it is,"This is a popcorn movie if there ever was one. A movie you watch on a big screen with blaring surround sounds. You will enjoy watching it, and it certainly won't tax your intelligence. This is not the best action film and certainly not the best science fiction, but you have a big cast, big explosions and a really cool story. I don't know if you need to have 12 versions of the dvd, but it is a fun ride."
3,Missing nine minutes...,"When I first found it, this was a wonderful video, and took me back to watching it on the big screen when it was first released. Later, I ran across the Limited Edition of Independence Day and I must say the restored nine minutes of original footage made the film much more enjoyable. Unfortunately, this original version lacks those removed segments and just isn't as enjoyable without them. Perhaps it's a commentary that I'd rather watch the DVD version of the Limited Edition than this BluRay version of the film without the restored scenes. I continue to wait and hope that someone decides to release a BluRay version of the full production."
4,BOOM!!! KAPOW!!! ZAP!!!,"What do you do when a race of super intellegent aliens with attitudes come down and start wiping out mankind? You do what anyone would do. You send a cable repair man and a NASA reject to stop them. This movie is really just a special effects bonanza, but it's a lot of fun and suprisingly enough can make you feel very patriotic towards the end. The plot is simple but it works well. Watch this movie. Come on. You know you want to see the White House blow up"
5,One of the best movies ever!,"I thought that Independence Day was one of the best movies ever! The cast was superb, the special effects were terrific! Two thumbs up for ID4!"
1,american propaganda!,"Never seen such a turkey, worthy of the worst soviet propaganda films... but for the US!"
1,Stupid movie made a lot of money,This is one pretty stupid movie that made a lot of money. Don't watch it
2,ruined by goldblum,"This movie could have been better if Jeff Goldblum and religion was left out. Jeff goldblum sucks as an actor. He ruined the Jerassic Park movies but, fits ""The Fly"" movie fine. Why is being Jewish a concern in this movie? It could have been left out! This movie could have been much better if changed in other ways also.Jeff G has no acting skill!"
1,I hated this movie,"This movie sucked big time. It was so Over the Top. One man takes on the galaxy with help from the President and a guy flying a crop duster. Gimme a break. Also, this movie sports some of the worst one liners."
4,Terrific Alien/Fight For Survival Movie. However...,"This film is terrific. However, I do have one problem with it. There was absolutely no love between the older sister and the younger brother. It didn't seem to me like she loved him at all, whereas in ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" she deeply cared about her siblings. But that was sorely missing in this movie. Scenes showing her care and concern for her brother should have been filmed. Also, more scenes showing Dylan with his mom (Vannessa Williams, excellent as usual) were needed. Same thing with the President's daughter and his wife. Good action, but more sentimentality was needed."
3,Not as good as it could have been,"Sit back, turn off your brain and say ""woooo!"" when the effects start and you'll love this film right up to the final scenes, when the President makes his cheesy speech and whichever fools wrote this (they did Godzilla too, didn't they? 'Nuff said really) decided to portray the British as incompetent and waiting for the Americans to save the day.And then we come to the blatant Star Wars rip-off of an ending. I sat in the theatre and couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was only missing a bearded bloke saying ""You'll be required to pilot your fighters down this trench and skim the surface to this point"".But if you ignore these points the film is a half-decent, heavily overhyped B-movie."
2,"Very lame big budget movie, skip it.","Typical dumb action movie, a lot of explosions, and nothing else. Contrast this with a movie like The Road Warrior, which was a pretty low budget film, but with great acting and directing and a lot of intense action scenes. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,"If you like a good sci-fi movie, then GIVE THIS ONE A MISS!!","I am so glad to see I'm not the only person not to be impressed by this movie. Seriously this thing sucked! If you want big-budget special effects, with no no plot what-so-ever then Independence Day is the one to see. However if you're like me, then this is definitly one to avoid. Oh, by the way does H.G.Wells know they totally ripped off his story?"
1,Terrible Service,This movie was supposed to be received by the 24th? I still haven't gotten it. I'll never use this vendor again. And I want to go on record as having reviewed her/him and they're terrible!!! Worst experience I've had ordering through Amazon.
4,Awesome Blu-Ray!,This is hands down one of the best Blu-Ray transfers I have seen so far. The video is crisp and clean with no visible artifacting. The audio is clear and defined with super nice bass. I would have to say I was really impressed with this BD. It was a pleasure to watch this movie again.I was dissapointed in only one regard and that was that this was not the extended directors cut (it is just the regular theatrical cut). I think that if the producers would added the Directors cut to this it would have really made this disc a 5 star!
2,50 minutes of great cinema (1 star for every 25 minutes),"Well, after all the talk when this movie came out, I just also had to see it. The first time I saw it, I thought it was great, but..... that was also the last time I saw the whole movie.Now I can only bare the first 50 minutes. Great suspense when the UFOs arrive, a great soundtrack, great acting and very good SFX, but after 50 minutes, after the alien-attack and the destroying of the major cities, this movie changes to a computergame-like childish one-of-many alienmovie in which only ridiculous laserbeam-shooting scenes are presented; no story at all anymore, just shooting, and of course a hero-saves-the-day-predictable-hollywood-happy ending. So when I've got an itch to see this movie, this itch has been scratched after seeing the first 50 minutes, then I turn it off. So, maybe when you are a short-movie-kind-a-person you could like it..."
5,A Well made movie!,"ID4 is one of the best alien thrillers in a while. Will Smith's performance is great and full of humor. He is, of course, the best actor in the film. Jeff Goldblum's prformance is wonderful too. Jeff plays a computer geek who is the one who saves the world by figuring out a way to shut down the alien's shields.The performance that is unforgetable is Bill Pullman as the President of the USA. His speech to the fighter pilots is unbelievable and unforgettable. The scene is moving and makes you feel like you could do anything.You will not be dissapointed!PS: Watch the skies!"
2,ID4=WHAT WERE WE THINKING?,"It's truly amazing to look at this ""film"" now and marvel that it's one of the top grossing motion pictures of all time. Basically, it's a marvel of marketing. Emmerich and Devlin have ""borrowed"" ideas from really great films and clumsily placed them in their movie. They even swipe the ending of their previous effort, STARGATE (which appeared prior to that in ALIENS and the obscure MOONTRAP). And when they're not lifting other filmmakers' ideas, they're putting in some of the most illogical concepts seen (ie, an alien computer can instantly download a program from an Apple)."
4,4 and a half star for the movie & 5 star for DVD.,"I like ID4!one of my favorite sci-fi movie for the past 5 year.Finally ID4 is on the DVD format,now is loaded with good extra,one disc is the movie & two disc with supplemental like making of the ID4 movie and more.Let me tell you the picture of ID4 is awesome!is crystal clear and very bright is better then VHS,the dolby 5.1 sound is great,the alien spacecraft was flying around my bedroom,AWESOME! The special edition was awesome ""great work 20th century fox!."""
1,Get a grip,"This movie really challenge you. I think this is one of the best movies ever made if you are able to ignore the stereotype characters, the bad acting, the terrible directing, the predictable ending, the xenophobic U.S. patriotism and above all the unrealistic plot. If you are able to ignore all of this and if you find that Commando is the best Arnold movie ever made, then you should watch this movie. On the other hand - if you like a movie to give you just a little bit else than pure patronizing - scream and run away!!!!"
1,READ THIS,"The person or persons resposible for writting this film should be punished. If your going to make a serious a movie, then make a serious movie, if your going to make a comedy, make a comedy, don't mix them. You can do that with some films, but not the one because it does not cleary draw the line at where the seriousness begins and the comedy ends. What makes me even more mad is that I saw a critic on T.V. who said that it was THIS generations STAR WARS, this scum should never even look the way of STAR WARS. The special effects are the only thing that sold this poor excuse for a science fiction film, and to tell you the truth they weren't anything that SPECIAL. END"
1,More stupid sci-fi.,"The only film approaching the stupidity of Godzilla, Dir. Emmerich delivers a film with good special effects and an embarrassingly vapid story. True this film had great commercial success and mass (herd) appeal, but it is best viewed in a theatre on opening day (thankfully come and gone). Its jingoist Only-America-Can-Save-Us theme is aptly served by its narrow, linear plot peopled with equally narrow characters played by an under utilized/over paid castID4 is a popcorn movie worth viewing once, not worth purchasing until it hits the bargain bins. Rent it instead. For better alien encounter sci-fi see Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Abyss, or X-Files. For special effects see The Matrix."
5,its a keeper!,"I first saw this at its opening in 1996 and it was the block buster of the summer. The transfer to blu looks really good (a little grainy in spots and may be the print, but I never noticed). as with most really good blu-rays you get lost in the movie and forget about the technology pretty quickly since the quality is so good. The sound is absolutely spectacular and will give your subwoofer a workout. I cant believe this is over 10 years old but is a clasic summer block buster movie. a must have for your blu ray collection"
5,Flashback...,"Actually, ID4 can only be judged (by me anyway) as a tribute film, dedicated to the great sci-fi movies that influenced and enthralled its creators. Having grown up on awesome stuff like WAR OF THE WORLDS, EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, STAR WARS, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, etc., I was grateful to Roland Emmerich for making this homage to all things sci-fi (c. 1950-1981)! Is ID4 heavy on cgi fx? Yes. Is there a series of unbelievable plot contrivances? You bet. Are the heroes too heroic? Yep. Still, it is the perfect tribute to an era of science fiction that I grew up watching. For that, I love it..."
5,Independence day,This is another really great action/adventure flick about aliens coming to conquer earth starring Will smith and Bill Pullman and when it comes right down to it a pilot flys up into an alien craft with a nuculear weapon that blows them away will smith and jeff goldblum are great buddies going out to kill the hostile aliens. Great flick.
5,Beautiful Chain,I can tell you that after receiving the chain and giving this to my wife the pictures that Amazon has online do not even come close to the beauty of this in real life. It is a great chain and if fact I also ordered a 24' version after I received this one.
5,Has anyone seen my husband?,"I gave this to my husband for Christmas and he hasn't put it down. It is consuming him. He has been addicted to sudoku puzzles since this past fall, so when I ran across this puzzle book I had to give it a go. He loved reading the Da Vinci code and I thought this had a great extra twist to it."
4,The Old Testament Speaks,"Read and used text for an Old Testament survey class and found it exceptionally helpful, both personally and for students.The Old Testament Speaks: A Complete Survey of Old Testament History, 5th Edition"
3,Futurama music with a twist!,"Man...or Astroman? puts on one heck of a CD with space-age surfer music that makes it fun to listen to. With an homage to B-Movies and beyond, the rattling of guitars and drums makes Man...or Astroman? a keeper. A must for having friends over for cocktails....like your drinks, they are sweet and intoxicating!"
2,Interesting but the parts I know about were false.,"I wanted to like this book, but so much reads in a nasty tone. First he hates vinyl and I love it so that's bad to start for me. Second he hates Jerry Lee but I also love him. The guy dropped The Killer from two labels! So much for knowing talent. Also I happen to know a few people he writes about in this book. They hold no malace, but they literly cracked up when I told them his versions of the story's. Read it if you want some gossip but as for me it's very mediocre. To be fair his own singing career is delt with quite well and the only part that read without venom."
2,Really?,"So much of these accounts of relationships and interactions with members of the music industry ring both false and bloated. I tried hard to like this book but the basic format is so tired and cliched. Just a litany of who he straightened out and set on the right path, and how he was so far ahead of his time. Includes all of the ""self"" cautions: self-important, self-righteous, self-centered, self-congratulatory. And also includes one of the most wrong-headed descriptions of the limitations of vinyl as a record format. To be married to this guy, trapped on an island in Hawaii, would just be daunting. Unexamined vanity has never prospered so openly. His riches clearly stayed financial."
4,A stunning debut,"Some of these stories might be described as vignettes. Sharp and swift injections of reality, they are far ranging in setting and character. The collection is somewhat noir in tone, and takes the reader by surprise on every page. Well worth reading."
3,An Epic Journey,"This is a great story. After reading it, I am amazed that he made it alive. Think about preparing for a voyage that nobody from your country has ever completed. (This was before Google and such.) His packing list is hilarious. I am not a sailor, but I really liked this book."
2,Big Disappointment,"I bought this book along with Davies' ""Dynamic Reti"", and after trying the ""Easy Guide"" out in some games I proceeded to play, I was quite dismayed at the lack of guidance I was given by the different chapters in the book. Either I already knew what he was telling me or I couldn't understand why he was suggesting what he was because some moves didn't make sense to me. The other problem I had was trying to keep up with the progression of his games in between his notes and bold print. My suggestion is to skip this book and get Nigel Davies ""Dynamic Reti"". There is much more unique information and insight offered there in greater clarity."
4,Easy Flowing Read,"For a easy flowing read, buy this book. It has plenty of pertinent information mainly from a federal emergency standpoint."
3,"Okay as an introduction, but ...",The book does a fair job of giving an overview of emergency management. The veiw of FEMA is obviously written by persons wearing rose colored glasses. The glossing over of errors by FEMA and other emergency management agencies does not allow the reader to understand the evolution of emergency management. The book should be factual and less fluff.
1,Horrible,I havent recieved the book yet... it shoulda for sure been in by Sep. 20th and its still not here. If i would have known that it took this long and i was lied to i would have never bought the book..
4,Good service,I ordered a text book and got excellent service from Amazon. It got here in a timely fashion and in excellent condition.
2,Not dependable,"Working in Afghanistan I purchased 12 of these locks to secure our 20 & 40 foot containers. At first they seemed fine but I quickly learned 3 major problems that have convinced my to not buy these again. 1) Half of the locks in a very short period of time developed a problem with the tumblers. When you turn 1 all 4 turn. You have to set the first number and hold it with your finger and then set the second and hold it too until you have set all 4. 2) Being in the weather (dust and rain) these locks got very difficult to operate. Some would not close, others became difficult to pull open while others had tumblers that became very difficult to read and turn. 3) I have learned of an easy way to open this lock.This particular master lock I would not purchase again. I am still a fan of Master and this is the only lock that I have used over the years that any problems. If you need this type of lock look somewhere else."
3,"Nice lock, but hard to use on most lockers","Bought this along with the Master 185D. The 185D plays nicer with the locks at my gym, while this one is a lot harder to lock and unlock. On the plus side, this 177 does look tougher, and even has a thicker shackle, but with the heavy shroud nobody will be getting bolt cutters around either of these tough locks!I recommend the 185D over this one. It was half the price of the 177 when I ordered, too!"
3,Printfix: A good budget option,"I have been using Printfix for calibrating my Epson R800 and I am running a PC on Windows XP with Photoshop CS (now upgraded to CS2)I find the results perfectly acceptable especially considering that other products on the market often cost more than double.I initially did have some problems with the version that was shipped (1.0)and my printer was not supported, but Colorvision technical support sorted the problem and sent me updates in the post.In summary, probably not the best, but for the price a good buy."
2,Not enough specific information...,"This book would be better called, ""Lightweight Backpacking"". With the exception of cutting off extra material and drilling holes in your toothbrush, most of the info is covered better elsewhere (see Chris Townsend's ""The Backpacker's Handbook"") and doesn't really fall exclusively into ultralight backpacking."
5,Got It For The Ultralight Camping,"I really don't plan to backpack, but need ultralight kayak camping ideas. This was just what I had hoped as it was full of good specific gear recommendations. It saved me a lot of time chasing product reviews.The author also got me inspired to go camping again as his style is very motivational. Really good little book!"
5,Great info for better backpacking,"I enjoyed reading the book, but better yet, it was loaded with great information to help me backpack with more comfort as I age. At 65, my body is changing, and because of that, I need lighter loads, but everyone can use that added help. I bought a copy for my son, 31, and he agrees with me on this: great buy for a small price!"
4,ultralight backpacker,thought this was an excellent book for those who want to try this type of hiking. Subject matter very good.
5,"If you dislike this book, you're taking it too literally","If you look at it from the proper perspective, this is a great book. The author describes the extreme. I know a guy who was the opposite extreme. He brought 3 pairs of shoes to the top of Half Dome. Most people are somewhere in the middle of those two extremes, and some people are more extreme than either end.This is a good book, especially for the beginner hiker. Read what it has to offer, and find your own place in the backpacking world."
1,Waste of money,I am a lightweight backpacker but I found this book useless.It appeared to be based on little experience and even less research.I could learn more from reading a catalog.
5,An Excellent Introduction for Novice Backpackers,"I think that some of the reviews here are from folks who were expecting an encyclopedia to ultralight backpacking, and were therefore disappointed. This book serves as an excellent introduction, covering all the topics relating to ultralight backpacking, but not going too deeply into any one topic.There's info on everything from cutting your toothbrush in half to getting rid of excess food packaging to getting fit for the trail to buying the right pair of shoes. If you're just getting into backpacking, and would like to see if ultralight backpacking is right for you, I can't imagine a better resource than The Ultralight Backpacker. I've been doing the ultralight thing for over ten years now, and I'm glad that now there's a way for others to see the benefits of going light.I wholeheartedly recommend this book to people eager to get into the backcountry but without the know-how."
2,"Good on the basics, not so 'Complete'","I find the ultralight backpacking movement refreshing. Having logged quite a few miles over the past 25 years hiking under 50-70 lb packs (only do >10 day trips), I can see the advantage! This book is a good intro, with a chapter devoted ot each of the major gear items (packs, tents, sleeping bags, etc). But, it's pretty short on completeness. I was disappointed not to find info of use to me beyond the very basics, except of a quick little chapter on long-distance hiking, but nothing on cross-country hiking needs or recommendations. Kind of an expensive book for just an intro. Skip this book and search the web for all the info (and more) than this book has."
1,Trim the fat.,"This book goes over the writrers gear list of his commercially bought products that he cut the labels off of and shortened the straps to lighten the load. Most of the info in this book is stated on the internet in better wording and a more practical manner. Much of this book is just his opinion of how things might work because he never enven tried the products. From my understanding he doesn't even have any serious experience under his belt. He has hiked several hundred miles but never completed any long distance trails. His biggest achievement is that he attempted the PCT. Save your money and do some online research or if you want to buy a book, find a copy of Ray Jardine's ""Beyound Backpacking."""
4,This 303's Pretty Good!,"I am a huge fan of Fatboy Slim, and the song ""Everybody Needs a 303"", in particular.Although this CD's got a coupla good mixes, if you really want to get the full 303 experience, get Part One. This disc has a good techo mix of 303, called ""Everybody Loves a Filter"", which is reason enough for the disc alone. There's also a nice jam called ""Es Paradis"", and a Radio Edit of ""Everybody Loves a Carnival"", as well as another nice tune called ""Where You're At"".The main reasons to get this CD are 1) Everybody Loves a Filter, and 2)Es Paradis.If you love ""Everybody Loves a Carnival"" and/or the original 303 mix, then get Part One. It has full-length mixes of both, and truly captures the essence of 303.In short, this 303's good for the fairly rare songs, but Part One's better."
5,Really excellent way to connect kids with their feelings,"This book has helped my students become more open and in touch with their real thoughts and feelings. They have become less aggressive and more thoughtful. And, they love the exercises. Great book."
4,Not Anamorphic,"I'm not complaining about the content, but rather the DVD mastering. Anamorphic technology was already in existence for more than six years when King Video produced this disc. There is no excuse."
5,MUST Read for Anyone Concerned with Toxic Chemicals in Products Sold Today!,"Imagine yourself basically a prisoner in your own home because of all the toxic chemicals in fragrances of products used everywhere we go! The author of this book describes her gradual build-up of becoming intolerant of fragrance. She used perfumes, scented candles, lotions, etc...and has ended up not being able to go out of her home because of the horrible reactions she has to the toxic fragrances! This is a scary book...but any one of us could face the same situation! A very important book...now, I think about it every time someone walks past with strong perfume or any other type of scent...thanks to the author for enlightening us!"
5,Love towels,"I was very surprised,the towels are very good quality..Looks very good with my shower curtains.."
4,Sweet and beautiful Sienkiewicz,"I have all of her books. I have made applique quilts for my grandchild based on storybook themes. This quilt blends beautifully for my expected grandchild. I don't particularly like the large ""open spaces"" of this quilt but it is easily modified. The design is not complicated and does not demand advanced skills. The advanced beginner can complete this piece easily. It is a lovely piece when completed."
3,Don't be fooled,"Don't let the picture fool you, it did me. This is NOT a mini LP or LP Sleeve, its a regular jewel case with an OBI strip. Guess I should have been more careful. The music is AWESOME. Italian Prog roacks and these guys are there with the best of them. 5 Stars for the music."
4,Bought for my step grandson,"We bought this game for my step grandson because he said that he liked it. That's all I know. He also loaned it to his cousin, so I assume he would recommend it."
5,Awesome game for kids or adults,Highly recommended. This game is simply the best platformer imaginable on the PSP. I would lobby that Daxter should be the PSP's premiere platform mascot. Awesome fun game. Even after finishing it I *still* want to go back and play more...
3,Could be better,"This is a great game that will keep you occcupied for weeks but not beating it. It has the best Graphics of any psp game but it highly lacks a good rating because of the boss factor. Unlike many other good games, this game has about 3 or 4 boss levels that take months to beat. Not even I have finishefd the final boss level and I have had it almost as long as I can remember."
3,Not bad...,"Kids would rather play some Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, or any other shoot em up or fighter. Takes a little getting use to, and the graphics are pretty nice. If you don't want your kids to have any shooters/fighters/violent type games this will work for the young ones and give them a little challenge as well."
5,Great Game!,"The bottom line is this game is one of the best ive played in awhile for the PSP. The game has outstanding graphics and incredible sound. It has a good plot and good single player.Here are some pros and cons...Pros- great graphics, great sound, great single player.Cons. Rediculousley short, and the multiplayer dissapointed me alot.Yeah the multiplayer isnt too great in my opinoin. Its kind of like a rock paper sissor match with bugs you collect throughout the single player adventure. Each bug has different strenghts and weaknesses. And you can find potions and tokens throughout the game that increases your bugs stats for that match. I kind of wanted something a bit more exciting though. But its not too big of a deal because the single player story make up for the multiplayer, its amazing. Overall.... great graphics, gameplay, sound.... if you see it at the store for a price you like pick it up, i think you will like it."
5,Great Game,"I am a huge fan of the Jak and Daxter series. I just recently got a PSP for my birthday thanks to my wonderful girlfriend. And I have to say, that Daxter was probably the best game I have played yet. It is long, and fun and entertaining. I strongly recommend this game. Have fun and enjoy..."
1,Not age appropriate,"I started playing this game before I gave it to my son to make sure it was appropriate. When you get to the second level a female character is introduced. The introduction to this character is very inappropriate. Daxter slides down a pipe and at that point the game switches from game play to video. When Daxter comes out at the bottom of the pipe there are a large pair of breasts in his face. The video scene is probably about thirty seconds long and it concentrates on displaying this female character's physical aspects. She wears a tight halter top, which fully displays her breasts and mid-drift, and low riding pants which allow the string from her underwear to be fully visible over her hips. The images of this character are completely inappropriate for a ten year old. This is not a game designed just for fun and innocent game play but contains sexual images and innuendo."
3,It's okay...,"This game was included with my recently-purchased PSP Slim.Eh... it's okay. Actually, I suppose if you like Mario 64 style platformers it's good, but these types of games are just not my thing."
2,it sucks,"This game is not action packed, its really really slow and boring.This game may be fun for kids but definitely not for a teen.Don't waste your money on this game, it looks fun, but when you actually play the game, its really really very very slow and boring.Overall:Don't buy it, its slow and boring for teens."
5,Fun especially on a small scale.,With the advancement of handheld game systems one thing is for sure. Some games on a small handheld system are just too dificult to play. However Daxter is the perfect example on how to make a great game just as enjoyable in small scale as large. Immediately you will notice the superb 'Animation like' graphics and great intermissions. If you liked the previous versions of this game series then you will love Daxter. I can't get my girlfriend to give it back!! :)
4,Cute game,"I received a copy of this recently and it's pretty fun. The graphics are really nice and the game handles well. I hear it's kind of short, but if you can get it really cheap and you like the Jak and Daxter console games, then this is a no brainer."
4,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! -ignorant scream in your'e ear- :P,Cheap as heck and is the best game you will find in years. you will spend hours playing through this game and if you're lucky you just might beat it.. i said might... Play the game and get it with no regrets.
5,"um, stuff","Possibly the greatest band ever. All their best songs on one disc. Incredible choice of covers, some done better than the originals. Low-fi? I'd say o-fi. High energy garage rock n roll."
4,"Still important, but nothing new here","This is an important book for people interested in American Protestant church history, especially the Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy of the 1920s. Machen is a good writer and had a keen mind. This is a book, not of theology, but of doctrines explained from a fundamentalist perspective. Machen believed that Christianity was a set of infallible ""truths"" based on ""facts"" that are gleaned from an inerrant Bible. One must accept these ""truths"" and that's how you get ""saved."" Modernists are lost, of course, since they only want to to destroy Christianity. Machen is wrong on this point, and his arguments are convincing only to those already convinced because they, too, share his ideological worldview. An important book worth reading, in the same way an artifact in a museum is important. But there is nothing new here and no contructive theology going on; only defensiveness and polemics."
1,The conservatives get it wrong again!,"It's not surprising that conservatives have a hard time with such things as PCUSA discovering a truer version of Christianity than they had.I think that to truly understand this book, and the mindset of the guy who wrote it (not to mention some of the comments about liberals not being true Christians), one has to read Bertrand Russell's comments on Marxism, and its parallels with (orthodox) Christianity. I could also cite how Russell thought Calvinism was a ""gloomy creed,"" which is something I can say that is not true of the liberal PCUSA! And thank God for that!Biblical inerrantists scour the bible for text to support their particular doctrine, in much the same manner as good Marxists scouring Kapital to see which way the dialectic is going ""objectively.""So, when they say the PCUSA has been hijacked by ""liberals,"" think, ""Nah, Stalinism is dead!""Just do a madlibs with Pravda, and you'll understand!"
4,Christianity and Liberalism,This book really draws the sharp contrast between genuine Christianity and the Liberalism that attacks the truth. This book should help the reader see many similarities between the time of Dr. Machem and the present challenges faces the church and it's purity.
5,Classic work defending the Christian faith,This is an outstanding book. Machen was a staunch defender of Christian orthodoxy. He was alarmed at the departure from essential tenets of the faith by liberal theologians. His insights were prescient in that he predicted the dire consequences that would result from attempts to reinvent Christianity.Machen did a great job of identifying the fault lines that would widen the gulf between the conservative and liberal wings of Christian denominations. His focus was on the developments in theological academia during the Progressive Era of American history. Several universities and seminaries allowed heretical teachings to flourish in their midst during the period. This is a must-read book for people interested in the reasons why the modern ecclesiastical community is plagued by division and internecine warfare to the present day.
4,A strong treatise against theological liberalism,"J. Gresham Machen lays out in plain terms his defense of historic creedal Christianity against the liberalism he saw in the 1920s. This book is often harsh, and does not deal lightly with what the author sees as heresy. This book is certainly no nonsense and forces a person to make a decision either for or against theological liberalism in many places. Machen forces the liberal to admit their divergence from historic Christianity, from a historical Jesus, and from nearly all that the Church claims to hold dear. This book unlike most railings against one viewpoint or another covers its bases well, and any reader regardless of theological position will learn much about how to make arguments using scripture and history.This truly is a great work."
5,"Uplifting, Inspirational, and Absolutely Fascinating!!","Their walk across America book was a sensational item and was on the best seller's lists for a long time. This book delves even deeper into the hearts and minds of the Jenkins. They are candid, refreshingly honest about God, life, faith, and other mysteries, and they explore their feelings in ways most people never experience. A beautiful book that should be read by anyone interested in the ""life unseen."""
4,Book Reviw,"This is a very entertaining book about the trans-america travels (walks) by the author. It tends to capture not only his adventures, but also the nature of the America as he knew it."
5,Oh! Joy!,"Finally a Singer who takes the time to mesmerizingly sing with passion, Joy's voice is one of the sweetest I heard in a long time, she lets her voice flow melodicly throughout the this cd, when other female artists choose to scream, she simply lifts her voice up a notch or two without losing the feeling, Joy, I'll ""Tell You How I Feel"" honestly ""I Can't Believe"" it took so long, but I knew that ""Someday"" you would come along, change the ""Situation"" & come ""Shake Up The Party"" I mean, ""How Can I Not Love You"" or this cd?? do yourself a favor treat yourself to some great music! it's a perfect blend of funky R&B tracks like ""Tell Me How You Feel"" & smooth as silk ballads like ""How Can I Not Love You"" It's amazing how music can lift your spirits when your feeling down. Pick up your copy today!"
3,Required text,Not the best read but for a required text it was fine shipped fast and great price!I would recommend to students needing it for civil war classes.
2,i kind of liked this book,This book was good because all the bugs.Also this could happen with bugs thats why i like it
5,great shovel,"Sure it is more costly than the ones I have gotten before, but it is so good, my sons bicker over which one gets to use it. I used it for the recent snow storm and found it clears the snow very well. Have used it about 10 times and it isn't broken yet, which is something since snow shovels usually break quickly. Very easy for a week old woman like me to use. It just pushes the snow like a snow plow. I love how wide it is, resulting in less passes over the snow to clean up. Arrived quickly."
2,Suncast SP2725 27-Inch Snow Shovel/Pusher,"I was very surprised that the shovel is 100% plastic. It has no metal on the shovel's edge, so it will likely wear quickly on the concrete and asphalt. This shovel cost nearly $20.00 from Toby's Tool Shed. They also charged $69.00 for shipping. Yes, I'm stupid!! I actually didn't see the shipping charge before it was ordered. I ordered another shovel from a different vendor, and the shipping was only $9.60. Don't be fooled by Toby's Tool Shed. The product is cheap plastic and they charge too much."
3,snow shovel/pusher,"The shovel wasn't exactly what I had hoped for. I have an old Timberland snow shovel/ pusher the I absolutely love and it is finally on it's last leg. However, I have had no luck in finding a replacement. I had hoped that this shovel would be it. It does a good job pushing, but as a shovel, it is not so great. The one I have has a little more curve to the bottom so it doesn't dig up the gravel driveway and the snow stays on the shovel much better, when you lift it up. For these reasons, I do not overly recommend this shovel."
3,Plastic snow shovel,The snow shovel was OK. I wish they sold a metal one. I have a metal one but the scoop edge is wearing out.
2,Its Okay not Great,It seems cheaply made compared to other shovels I have purchased. The reviews were so good that I thought this would be great. It is average. I bought another shovel after I recieved this from Rural King for half the price and twice the quality. I didn't return because its too much of a hassle. Very lightweight and cheap.
1,Edge is not straight,"I purchased this at the end of last winter so didn't have a chance to use it. Now that I've used it once I'm not happy with it. On the shovel I received the blade is not straight, it's actually bowed a bit so the middle hits the ground while the edges curl up slightly not touching the ground, so I'm only getting about 1/2 the usefulness out of the wide blade. First time I bought a snow shovel sight unseen and probably the last. When I buy it at the store I can check to see it's level by setting it on the ground. Shoveling snow isn't the funnest chore, doing it with a defective shovel that covers half the ground it should makes it way worse."
2,Wears out quickly,"I use this shovel on a rough finish concrete circular driveway. I have used it a total of seven times and have lost about five inches off the end of the shovel due to wear.If you have a smooth surface to work on I'm sure you will get a lot more use.I am now looking for a 27"" replacement with a steel wear strip. Suncast does make one, SP2750, but the wear strip is on the top, not the bottom of the shovel."
5,sno shovel/pusher,65 yr old man with heart problems. This shovel(pusher) has been a blessing with our winter. I recommend it for anyone looking for something to push snow...acts like small snow plow
3,High quality construction but sizing is too small,"I ordered a large and although it is supposed to fit someone 3"" taller and with a chest size 2 inches larger, it was much too tight to wear.Quality neoprene, pads, zippers, but sizing is too small for based on the chart provided by NRS.Part of the problem with this design (and others) is not having a Velco attached shoulder strap so that the suit can be adjusted based on the distance from the crotch to the top of the shoulders which varies from person to person."
2,Too Loose to Be Effective,The materials and quality are good on this wetsuit but the neck line and chest area fit too loosely to adequately preserve warmth. After one use in cold water my legs were warm but my torso was as cold as it would have been with no suit.
2,Fair,The price is on the high side and not as good as described. I would not recommend it to others.
4,Second grader loved it,"My second grade daughter was stressing out over timed tests at school, especially substraction. She gets these cards out and wants to play. The rules say to arrange the cards in equations and just ""imagine"" the plus, minus and equal signs, which is too abstract for a beginner. So I made a simple mat on a sheet of paper with places for the cards and the symbols written down like this ____ + _____ = _____ or this ____ + _____ = _____. Three times each because the goal is to create 3 equations as fast as you can. Anyway, the homemade mat made it easier for her to play and it has really helped her confidence level."
2,incredibly poor quality,"This product is about as cheaply made as possible. It is made of particle board with laminate that came with tons of chips and dings in it. Several more resulted from assembly because it is so cheaply made. The locking clasps for assembly are so cheap they were defective. We had to use pliers to stretch them out so that they would lock properly. The backing is very cheap and looks cheap, with gaps and was hard to properly align. The inserts are flimsy plastic, so only very light shoes can be stored. The edges of the insert don't touch around the frame. I placed the cubby in a closet so it isn't really seen and it functions fine. I would maybe pay 50-70 dollars for it but definitely not worth the $240 that the company charges!! It makes Ikea look like high quality it's so poor."
4,jbt cd,"the cd was the one of the cheapest i have ever bought which is incredible. but i was expecting a digipack and instead cam a jewel case which i was pretty sad about. all of john butlers cd's are usually digipacks anyway and after the album title it says ""(Dig)"" so I assumed that meant it was a digipack (obviously not a digital copy as that's not what I was buying). Apart from that, it arrived in my mail box very quickly"
3,Very good without much great,Earnest but somewhat predictable roots rock benefits from punctual acoustics and soulful delivery but often falls into somewhat generic compositional form.
5,Painfully good...really too good...,Just a brief review and recommendation to buy this album - incredible songwriting and amazing talent as a band...a great listen time after time...has been in my CD player since I bought it...makes me want to go see them live! The lyrics are intuitive and creative... These are some incredibly talented guys!
2,Not as good as I had hoped,The music on this CD was not nearly as good as I had hoped for...Too much similarity from song to song...
5,"Great machine, but tech support needs help.","This is a great machine, suits my needs over and above. The only concern is tech support. They are willing to send parts and have a service company come to your home to fix the machine quickly. Only problem is if tech support would ask the right question. My problem was there is an on/off switch that when you put this machine together is in the carpet and you can't see it and tech support doesn't tell you it is there and three weeks later, a service person switches it on and you lost three weeks of use.(and feel pretty silly) But all in all very happy."
5,Exceptional Value,I've owned this treadmill for a few months and absolutely love it! This is an exceptional value for the price. I would recommend this to any of my friends.
4,Good deal for the price....,"Fairly easy to put together....it has a magnetic safety clip that is not explained really well in the manual. Basically, it is a good feature because the machine will not operate unless you have the magnetic clip attached to the machine...thus preventing kids from being able to simply click the START button. In the same token, don't lose this clip or you cannot operate the machine. Also, please NOTE the ON button is hidden underneath the bottom front of the machine. Before you purchase, be sure to check that you have the right ""power supply"" for the machine so that you don't damage the machine or knock out your electricity in your home. Everytime you change ""gears"" (such as speed, program or turning the machine on or off, there is a really loud ""beep""...so don't expect the baby to stay asleep while you work out....other than the above and in general we are happy with our purchase!"
4,diana (new york),"i bought this tredmill couple of months ago, and i never had any problems...it was easy to put together, and its affordable..."
5,this was worth it!,"Delivered on time, easy to put together, and a great price! I love it and am happy that I made this purchase!"
5,EXCELLENT BUY!!!,"I PURCHASED THIS ITEM ON FEBRUARY 22ND AND WAS GIVEN AN EXPECTED DELIVERY DATE OF MARCH 9TH. I RECEIVED MY TREADMILL ON MARCH 1ST, PUT IT TOGETHER THE SAME TIME AND DID A TRIAL WORK OUT FOR 20 MINS. THE ASSEMBLY WAS A BREEZE I DID IT MYSELF, THE ONLY THING MY HUSBAND DID WAS TO HELP ME LIFT IT UP THE STAIRS. ALL THE PARTS FIT PERFECTLY, JUST FINISHED WORKING OUT FOR AN HOUR AND AM EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF MY TREADMILL, IT IS QUIET, EVERYTHING WORKS THE WAY THEY IT'S SUPPOSED TO. WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS TREADMILL? DEFINITELY .... IN FACT BUY IT BEFORE THE PRICE GOES UP!!!!!"
4,Reource books,Very pleased the books arrived so promptly and in good condition. Staff most anxious to review book and the contents for information that will be most useful for them.
2,You hafta like Waits to enjoy,"This 20+ track album was a surprise in 2 ways....it's lack of real musical tone, and that it grows on you. I bought it for one track, ""Clap Hands"" which I'd heard on a juke box, but I was taken back at how unappealing the album was at first. I have now heard it three times and I'm getting into it, but had I known the overall style of Waits, I'd have never purchased."
3,not enough new or rare material,"this is a good compilation, but does not include enough rare or hard to find tracks. also only two live songs and there should be more since waits is a very funny and entertaining perfomer. this albumn just left me wanting more and tom waits does'nt put out singles he puts out albumns so if you have them all, which i do, there's really not much for you to get excited about here."
3,Big Fan from Boston,"I hate compilations, I really really do, moreover, while I always wish Tom continued success, it bothers me that a whole new generation of fans is going to be introduced to his music through a gathering of his old works from many Cd's. People finding Tom is great, people thinking they know alot about Tom Waits because they own Beautiful Maladies is maddening. I say three stars simply because I know and love the music, but I give a big thumbs down to the whole idea behind the release"
3,"Tom is brilliant, but the selection of songs here is not.","I have heralded Tom Waits as the perhaps the most inventive, interesting, and wonderfully mad artist these last few decades have seen. I own virtually every one of his albums, and recieved a copy of ""maladies"" as a gift. It is dissappointing to see the selected tunes here as representative of Waits in his Island years. There are truly much better representations of his work. Besides, how could you have a best of Tom Waits. Everything is best. Buy Rain Dogs, or Bone Machine, or Swords, or Nighthawks at the Diner instead."
4,Great collection of modern Waits; disappointing for fans.,"The 23-tracks spanning Waits' 1983-1993 recordings are excellent and obviously chosen with care. Beautiful Maladies is a wonderful primer for his work. However, long time fans will probably be disappointed. With 5 years since the last release and Tom Waits leaving Island, I was expecting this collection to be a bit more special. The included CD booklet only contains lyrics; no pictures, biography or other interesting notes that you might expect. There are also no special tracks. This is a flat-out compilation of existing in-print material, without even a hint of sonic improvement."
1,I will not buy these again,"I received this item today, and I will not buy these fertilizer tablets again. There was no seal on the outside of the lid or underneath the lid. The bottle was a little over half full, and most of the tablets inside have crumbled into powder. There is no way there are 75 tablets in there. I will be returning these for a refund."
2,Keep looking,I received this item within a few days of ordering. Tablets were mostly a powdered mess in bottle. The product that remained in tablet form crushed in my fingers as I tried to insert them into my aquatic pond plants.
4,Plant Food Tablets,I thought they were easy to use and the price was right. The plants in my pond and my neighbors thrived over the summer.
1,It's not tablets,The tablets crumbled in my fingers and became powdered fertilizers. It's not in tablet format where I can insert it into the container. Not recommended.
5,We didn't have seen that since the Brel phenomenon !,"It is actually some 3 decades after the master Jacques Brel, a new great phenomenon of french music. Rhythm, lyrics, voice and instruments: everything is so perfect that you fell bewitched by this music coming from France. Really enthusiastic, a very good choice to discover the new generation of french great artists such as ""La Tordue"", ""Dominique A"" or ""Yann Tiersen"". A music for the happiness of the ears..."
5,Un p'tit air,"I totally loved it, it's a charming acoustical experience. I'd like to highlight track #16: ""Un p'tit air"", it's a delicious tone. Undoubtedly, one of Ttes Raides' best albums."
2,"Fairly interesting topic, quite self-involved narrator.","Appears to have been written a la romance novel -- indulgent descriptions of ""my husband's Armani suit"", ""my Mediterranean beauty"" and the like -- the truly heroic ones are Jennifer, who carried the child for 9 months, and husband David, who endured surgery. Perspective of Liza is self-involved and her ambivalence toward becoming a parent is insulting to those who may choose adoption as an alternative. This seems written with an eye toward a Hollywood screenplay."
3,"It's still Discworld, but not Pratchett's best","This book doesn't seem to hold up to the rest of his books so far in the series. It's still a good book, don't get me wrong... I just feel that it doesn't carry the same weight as the others...."
3,Kindle edition - NO FOOTNOTES,"Not one of my favorite books, which is why i don't have it on my bookshelf. I bought the kindle edition to re-read one of my favorite authors. I was highly disappointed in the fact that there are no footnotes included in the Kindle edition. All of those little sidejokes that I look forward to in Pratchett's novels are omitted. I was going to buy other Pratchett books on the Kindle...."
5,Great as usual,i have not found a Pratchett book that I do not like. This one is a great read and I could not put it down.
4,Pterry Ptakes on King Ptut,"OK, so Pterry Pratchett can even make Egyptology and the mystery of the pyramids hilarious. Loved the bit where Teppic and Ptracy and the algebraic camel get caught in the crack between dimensions. Who knew camels could be so deep?- C.A. Wulff, author of Born Without a Tail"
3,Huh?,"Unlike other books I've read by Mr Pratchett, I found this one (Pyramid) to loose focus about half way through it."
3,The Pyramids seemed...........Flat,"Teppic has become pharaoh, but doesn?t know what he has to do. So for his dead father, he builds the biggest pyramid that he can make. But the power of the pyramids are errupting and choas and gods shall be let loose. A story full of crocodiles, gods, philosophers, knifes and mummies.One of my least favorite. It was way to flat. It felt like it was written in a day really fast so another book could be made. It was also a little boring in some parts.But I still loved the Teppic, he is fun and cool. I loved the philosophers and the crazy political guards. The book was hilariouse. So I guess it really should be a 3 and a HALF. I also loved the ideas.If Terry Pratchett had only put a little bit more depth into the book, it could have been one of the best."
1,"One of the worst discworld novels, so far.","The first part of this book revolves around the idea of an ""assassin's guild"". This is undoubtedly the wittiest and most original part, unfortunately it is also the briefest. Pratchett is unable, or unwilling, to continue in this vein and instead tacks a great wad of stodge on to this promising introduction. Whilst this manages to pad it out to a reasonable length to be published, it also makes it profoundly wearisome. Obviously however it is this tripe, more concerned with its own twisted logic than with being amusing, which Pratchett considers to be the most important part. This is evident from the reworking he gives most of these ideas in ""Small Gods"", and by inflating the size of this book he manages to make the same old themes more turgid than ever before. If you value your sanity then stop at p68, progress beyond this point at your own peril."
3,And there are bits about religion and maths,"I'm late to the party, but have finally read and finished a book that is totally by Terry Pratchett. It was enjoyable--sort of a Douglas Adams lite. I think one of the reasons it feels toned down is that everything in DiscWorld seems to be an analogue for something in our world. (I'm not entirely certain why the Egypt analogue was named after a Jelly Baby.) That gives things a little distance. With the HitchHiker books, Arthur was very firmly rooted in the banality of our own familiar world, and served as a more effective foil for the wacky folks he met."
1,not what I ordered,Didn't get the part I ordered. Just a total waste. Would have been cheaper to buy the part from a dealer. Was the same part number but not the same part. Tried the get hold of amazon and they are worthless !
4,A BOOK WORTH ANYONE'S TIME,I HAVE 12 OF O. HENRY'S ORIGINAL BOOKS DATING FROM 1910 TO 1912. PLUS THE COLLECTION OF MARK TWAIN FEATURING TOM SAWYER AND HUCKLEBERRY FINN. THESE BOOKS NOT ONLY WILL DAZZLE YOU BUT YOUR CHILDREN WILL BE THRILLED FOR YEARS AND PASS THE SAME TO THEIR CHILDRENS.
1,The worst thing for a new debater,"This book will teach you nothing but how to be a bad debater. The book uses old debate theory and old jargon that no longer applies in todays world of fast paced debate. I would recomend that no one ever read this book. There is much more that can be learned by watching out rounds at tournaments and by going to camp. You can even bring in college debaters from your are to help, but DON'T LET YOUR STUDENTS READ THIS BOOK!!!"
4,Just Like Mom does,"This Microwave is so much fun for your little helper. My daughter loves this. She is constantly making fun little meals for all of us. I love how realastic the lights and sounds are. The food is not the greatest quality, but the microwave makes up for that."
5,a big hit,"Santa gave this to my 2 1/2 year old daughter. She (and all of her friends and cousins) are having a fantastic time with it. Lots of features for such an inexpensive toy! Seems durable enough, though she's pretty gentle with her toys. A great buy - we're very pleased."
3,Loud and Broken,"We got this for our daughter so she would have something to explore (buttons, cause and effect, opening and closing etc.) and were disappointed when we realized that two of the buttons didn't work and it was so loud! When the food turns in the inside it sounds like a roaring motor and the recorded voice that says when the food is ready sounds muffled and unclear. My daughter loves putting things in and pretending to microwave, but even she avoids turning it on because of the noise."
3,It brakes very easy,"My daughter was very happy when we first got it but it fell one day from the table and the door to the oven came off and broke, what good it is if it breaks that easy. We tossed it."
4,Great Attention Keeper,My 18-month old son loves this toy! And what a deal at $10. It is quite realistic with a timer and turntable. While the timer is counting down a green light comes on which then turns red when the food is ready. And the included foods are cute and more nutritous items than some other playsets. This really has kept his attention and helped him learn to manipulate the buttons to make the oven work.
3,NOT for the seasoned exerciser...,"I am a new Mom who has exercised regularly and at times quite vigorously over the years - - I found this video to be basically beginner level. The aerobic portion is way too short at 20 minutes, as is the ab and butt toning portion, where there are way too few reps."
2,Not for me!,"As a working mom, my schedule is pretty hectic. So I need a video that gets to the point. I found the aerobic steps complicated and silly - a little too Saturday Night Feverish for me! And Denise is a little too perky for my post-partum mood! I recommend turning the volume down and cranking up some better, livelier music to drown out her dull tunes and ""motivational"" talk."
1,caught up in his own lies...or at least differing acounts,"Neale in the interview says when this voice of ""God"" went on to say the 10 commandments were not from God he (Neale) said he was shocked and news to him as he had believed them to be true, Yet, in ""Friendship with God"", Neale says he grew tired of the Bible and it's hard truths while he was reading and teaching it in sunday school and so, he began seeking for truth, began reading the Koran and many other spiritual texts, then years later he started to chat with God. There is NO WAY he believed in the 10 Commandments, especially the 1st one....ye will have no other god before me as I am a jealous God"". In this interview, Neale shows how intelligent he is, he is a VERY wise man, yet in CWG and the ""New Revelations"" he seems to have the intelligence level of a moron. You decide for yourself, this was MY review."
2,not Muddy's best,"I hate to put down anything Muddy has done, but truthfully, this is the worst album of his I have ever heard. Whoever is playing bass on the first 5 or 6 songs is completely out of key, and doesn't appear to know the changes. The sound quality of the recording is very poor too. Muddy Waters does have some GREAT live albums but this is not one of them. Instead of this listen to LIVE AT NEWPORT, or MUDDY WATERS LIVE."
5,Fabulous,"We used these plates paired with the 6"" dessert plates for a semi-formal Christmas Dinner. They looked great as an overlay for the china dishes that we used. Great product and great price!"
3,Totally rad for 1985,"Yeah so, this WAS one of the classics... I salute the game, but now this is the year 2010 sailing the ocean against the wind for 3 hours just doesn't have the appeal that it used to like when I played the game on the Commodore 64. The revamped, remastered version has a few new tricks up it's sleeve, but all in all you'd be better off saving up for a PS3 and dumping your money in one the new hotness like God of War 3 or Batman: Arkham Asylum. Yeah, I know those games have about as much to do with pirates as Taco Bell does to a Bowling alley, but it doesn't matter; I've seen the light- don't waste your time trying to re-live the glory days, drop the zero and get with the hero! Say no to games that make you sail against the wind for 3 hours straight!"
4,Arrrrr!!!,"If ye' be wantin' adventurous fun, this be it, lads. Treasure ships and Trade Galleons will fear your name in this incredible game by Sid Meier. My only problem is how little there really is to do, great replay value though!"
1,Not a very good start......,"Ok, I bought the download version cause I didnt want to go through the hassle of waiting for the mail.... Apparently this was the wrong choice. The game downloaded fine the first try BUT when i went to play it. the screen popped up asking for the second disc.... which i didnt have cause i bought the download, so i uninstalled and tried again. After i downloaded it the second time i pressed install... message pops up telling me that there was an ""error 1628: failed to install""... I am currently in the process of finding out how amazon is going to fix this, dont know why they have a download that doesnt work but mabey its fixable. If it is fixed my review might change a little, but this should not have happened."
5,Not open yet.,I haven't opened this game yet. This is a second copy of the game and the first copy we have has lots of graphic problems. Hopefully this new version will work better.
5,Outstanding game play!,"Sid Meirs is genius. This game will give you many hours of intense game play. I wish there were more games of this quality to enjoy, instead of the mindless shoot-em-up stuff that makes up 90% of the games sold. I love the open endness of the game which allows the player to enter the game as not only a pirate but a trader or Spanish raider. It's also educational for younger players; teaching them the geography of the tropics and the location of many current cities. Highly recommended!"
4,Great game,"I'm told this is a great update of an old Sid Meier's Classic. It's apparently gotten a lot easier in the new edition (as video games tend to do), but there's plenty of challenge if you play in Swashbuckler mode.Good game with above-average (think B to B+) replay value."
4,good time killer,"If you are looking to kill 3 hours during the day it is very easy to get wrapped up in plundering the seas. Not overly difficult, but fun."
3,Fun For 10 Hours,"The game is amazingly addictive for a short while, until the mini games get repetitive. Since the mini-games are 70 % of the game, there's no real point in playing this game more than once. Also, at the game-age of 32, it's SUPER DUPER hard to beat the boss on swashbuckler difficulty, for me at least."
2,"Overly ambitious, doesn't quite deliver","Sid Meier has gotten to the point in the gaming industry where all he has to do is attach his name to a game and it will sell. Pirates! is a game that offers so much promise, but it never really quite gets there.Yes, the game did provide me with several hours of enjoyment. The basic premise of the game is a blast. However, each goal in the game is accompanined by a mini-game. At first, the mini-games are nice Easter eggs, but they get very boring very fast.Overall, the game needs a lot of improvement. With a little tweaking, I believe Pirates! had the ability to become one of those games that define a genre. As it is, the game seems incomplete. The main quest never stops being enjoyable. The mini-games that must be accomplished in order to complete the main quest get unbearably tedious."
2,Pirates Dissapointing,"I purchased Pirates after reading a few reviews and expected it to be an entertaining game. While the concept of the game is solid I found it to be very disappointing as a whole.First of all, there is little possible customization within the game, as you can only choose from a set of ships and buy generic upgrades.The character interaction is frustrating and quite boring as the voices can only say ""blah"" and ""meh"".The controls are very hard without a number pad and I could not find any way to change them. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU SO NOT HAVE A NUMPAD. Dueling is nearly impossible on my laptop without a numpad.I like the civilization series, but was disappointed byt Pirates. I would recommend saving your money to buy CIV 4 if you don't have it, and don't waste it on Pirates."
3,Captain Blood.,"This is a game is which the player is in charge of a ship and sets about the seas in search of his kidnapped family. You can become a privateer, a pirate, a trader, or anything in between. You can plunder ships or cities. You can also court Governor's daughters. There is a separate type of play for ballroom dancing, dueling, naval combat, land combat, navigating, treasure hunting, and more. The game is entirely open-ended. It has beautiful graphics, a wonderful story-line, and is much fun. So what is not to like? Well....My main complaint is its lack of realism. It is not just the fact that when you stick a rapier into someone he only staggers back as if the blade is not sharp; the main problem is that nobody duels properly: Yourself and your opponents pull back blades before thrusting, and make absurdly large swings. There are lots of minor problems aside from that, but as a fencer who studies the history of dueling, that type of cartoon fighting will always irk me."
5,Favorite Game for 7-9 year old Boys,"I was introduced to this game while shopping for a b-day gift for 9 year old in Target. A stranger saw me looking at all the computer games, asked what I was looking for and strongly recommended the game. I took a chance and later heard that the recipient LOVED the game. A few months later, my 8 year old son bought it himself. He and his 7 year old brother love it too. This game is one of the games they play the most."
3,Fun for a while,"Sailing around and sinking ships is fun, as is going into the local taverns. It would have not been too much trouble to vary the taverns a bit to make it more interesting."
3,A modernized classic.,"While there should be little doubt that this game is a reissue of the original pirates game of the 80's, and some parts seem dated at best, it is still hours of fun. The drawbacks of the game are dated graphics, some repetitious fight scenes, and rather generic quests but there is just something about Pirates! that is somehow addicting. Hardcore strategy buffs might not care for the game due to its limited choices and micromanagement but for those of us who grew up with the original, it is a wonderful re-release of a classic, and a more than a fair gaming value."
4,"Entertaining, keeps you playing","There's a lot to enjoy about this game. It's very easy to learn, game controls are simple, and the creative aspects are superb. The graphics leave something to be desired, but overall it's a great game to waste a couple weeks on. I would say the only big downside is the redundancy after playing the game for a while. Sea battles, sword fights, sailing around doing the same thing can get old. Nice game for 12-14 year olds. But really, who doesn't like pirates?"
1,Total letdown,"When Sid Meier's Pirates! came out in 1987, it immediately became a classic, it was the game of the year. The game had such a success that they did a powerful sequel in the early 90's called Pirates Gold buy unfortunately, it had performance issues with graphics, etc and had lots of bugs. Now Imagine, a dedicated community of fans of the game waiting 10 years for a sequel of this masterpiece, and when it comes out, it looks like preteen game. The game is addictive and truly follows the spirit and nature of the original Pirates!, however, the cartoonish approach of the game obliterates any serious attempt to deliver a true pirate strategy adventure game. If you expect a serious pirate game, you should not play this game because you will find the exact opposite because of its cartoonish and childish approach."
1,What were they thinking,"The reviews i read about this game where good, so i had high hopes getting ready to play, and this game got really old fast. the coolest part of the game is the ship battles everything else is horrible. Everything you do when your actually on land didnt make any sense, and there was no creativity put into it. This game might have been good 15 years ago but today one of the worst games i have played. Dont even waist the $9.00 for this game."
1,I got ripped off!,I think this is a clear case of false advertising. The photos on the page for this item show it coming with a map and a game book and all kinds of stuff. All I got was a cheap looking DVD in a plain case. I think this might even be a pirated copy. Maybe I'll call my buddy at the FBI.
4,Just old fashioned fun,"Within minutes of installing this on my windows 7 machine, I was up and running and playing. Controls are very intuitive, and gameplay is deceptively easy.Fun, and even my 11 year old enjoyed it. In all, fun to play, easy to load, and yes it does wok in Windows 7"
5,Great Game,"Next to Diablo II, this is one of the best RPG games I've played. After a while the dancing and Sword fighting gets a little stale, But I challenge anyone to get 126 points has a Swashbuckler. The game is easy to play with just the mouse and number pad. Great game and you can't beat the price for the hours of playing the many different combinations. Thanks Sid."
5,Hours of fun,"A great remake of t he classic!First, game play is really easy. Just make sure you have they right specifications to play the game or it will slow down the land battles casuing impossible play. I also recommend you use the number pad for better play. You can make the game as hard as you want by selecting the diifculy level. THe more you play, the harder you can make it.Great graphics of the Spanish main with realistic sounds and sword fighting. Challenges using memory and puzzles to search for lost family members and burried treasure. As you play on, your character ages and it relects on your look and abilities. It's like a virtual againg making game play harder when you age.Good clean fun for all ages with moderate violence. Great for younger kids!"
3,"Simple fun, but gets old quickly","This game is great for a simple game that is fun right away, but it's pretty repetitive and gets old quickly."
4,If I could only dance!,"The original Pirates game was so enjoyable I was thrilled to see this upgrade released. It is quite similar to the original, a light-hearted game that can be enjoyed without micromanagement. Not extremely technical in nature it is just a easy to play, relaxing and fun game. As an old-timer I never could quite get the hang of the dance though which pretty much did the game in for me. I'm sure that its not all that hard for those more proficient in video games. If you want a detailed thinking simulation this game is not it. If you want a fun game for some relaxation, is easy to learn but still offers you numerous options this is a good choice. If only I could master that dance!"
3,"A decent text-book, but not stellar.","I liked the book. It was well written and at times even amusing. but I don't hink it was succinct enough, and I also felt that the author explained the easy concepts far too much and the hard ones not enough."
1,dazed and confused,"Terrible book - often when explaining problems, it skips steps (so you have no idea how they got from one point to the next), and they show so few examples. Over 100 homework problems for each chapter, with only the odd-#ed answers in back (no explanations, or even-#ed answers), and most of the problems have nothing similar that are explained in the chapter!I'm having a rough time comprehending this book, and I'm an 'A' calculus student."
4,NOT FOR SELF-STUDY,"Overall, Tipler's physics series is a successful introductory texts for physics majors who have had good high-school physics background. For me, it is not a good choice. It is very obvious that Dr. Tipler explains those basic concepts in a very informal manner. Physics is, I believe, a systematic study of the complex phenomena of the universe. Surely we shall develop our sense of appreciation of the beauty of Nature and our creativity of modeling the physical phenomena. However, in presenting the laws of physics, there is no need of being informal. That is what I believe. Probably I haven't understood enough physics and English. If so, forgive me!"
1,This book is so hard to understand.,"I'm a straight A student, and I've never had any problems in any of my classes. But this book is making me failing my physics class. It is sooooo hard to read and understand. It's making me so afraid of physics."
1,WORST TEXT EVER!!!,"this book is BAAAD. i hated it. it's very hard to understand. it's too technical. i think it should explain the concepts more in english, instead of all technical then it'll be easier to understand."
5,Well worth the effort,"This is an almost 400-year-old book, yet it has been surprisingly influential. The major problem with this book has always been that the author loaded its 935 pages with Latin quotations. I tried to read it a few months ago, and, even though English translations are given directly after most of the Latin, after about 75 pages I couldn't read any further; the long passages of Latin, followed by English translations, were just too much for me. The edition I purchased from Amazon.com translates all the Latin into English, and integrates it into the text; a much better reading experience. Of course, I don't know if a fully-translated edition is currently in print; it would be nice if it were. If anyone who has heard of this book would like to try reading it, he or she will have a rewarding experience. ""The Anatomy of Melancholy"" is too great a book to go unread in the Twenty-First Century."
1,"Ugly, noisy, and quite overpriced","When I first looked at the pretty pictures I was in love.. that metallic look is great. But don't be fooled. When I first opened the case to place my palm in it I was shocked to hear that squeaking noise! If you don't want to attract attention don't buy it.Then came that ugly interior padding, it just didn't feel right, especially with that price tag that came along with it.The real downfall came when I tried to use my handheld on it.. it is terribly uncomfortable!! I just couldn't bear to write on it with the stylus or do pretty much anything else with it.Now I only use it when traveling.. the only good thing going for it is the relaxing feeling I get when throwing it, along with all my stuff, into my not so organized suitcase or backpack. At most it will keep your handheld safe. That's were the one star went."
2,a bit dinky,"I wanted a case which didn't involve either velcro or animal skin, so this seemed like a good option. however, it's very difficult to open the first week or so of use, after which it starts to loosen up to the point that it opens when you don't want it to. it's thin and light, yes-but be careful; it's so thin that I actually nearly cut myself on the edges a couple times. I'm seriously thinking of taking mine back and shelling out the extra [money] for the palm brand one."
2,Rhinoskin Hard Case,"I purchased the case for my Palm 500. It is bulky, hard to open, and extremely unattractive. I returned it & bought the hard case that is manufactured by Palm. I would definitely recommend getting that one instead."
1,Too Protected,My Visor fit nice and snug into the case. Unfortunately I couldn't open the sliding cover without a screwdriver. Rhinoskin offered no explanations or excuses when I called but did accept the return without complaint.
2,defect,"I bought this for a decent price, but the support piece that goes across the bottom was too long. Instead of sending it back, I just used a saw and drill to cut it right and drill new holes. Would have thought the factory could have done it right in the first place though.It's a nice enough piece, but if I was going to have to use carpentry skills, I should have just made my own stand."
3,Not a good fit for us,"While it is beautiful, and seems well crafted, it was too short for us. I worried that water and drool would warp and damage the wood after some time. I have returned this item."
1,Wrong CD!!!,"I was expecting this amazing production from my favorite artist, and received the CD with the Album. When I played the CD it had the songs from ""Ojala que Llueva Cafe"", even though I love this album, is not what I ORDERED!!!! Not a good experience!!!! Never buying from you again!!!!"
1,defective product,"The cd I received for this was defective in that it was only partially recorded. I wrote 2 emails to the provider, Bluesky, and I never received a reply back. I am therefore left with a useless cd and am out my money. I am not sure that I feel comfortable about ordering from Amazon in the future and will certainly never order anything from Bluesky again."
2,REMIXED-TO-DEATH!,"While this middle-of-the-road compilation has it's highlights, too many remixed versions of mediocre hits were a bore to me. Where are the underground dance classics ""On Your Knees,"" ""Sinning,"" ""Sorry,"" and ""Am I Ever Gonna Fall In Love in NYC?"" Had these been included in remixed versions, I'm sure sales would have peaked!!"
4,Here's Grace,"This is a two CD collection. I have been listening to CD one over and over. It is unfailingly brilliant, and sounds more modern that most of the tracks on the top 20 today. Wonderful work, and as other reviewers have noted, don't worry about there being two recordings of the same track - the dub versions are significantly different to the single or album versions and equally as enjoyable (kind of like going to see the band live rather than listening to the LP).I was less impressed with the second CD. There are great tracks there too but it is less consistent.If you are looking to buy the best of Grace this is the best way to do it in one purchase. Other ""Best of Grace"" collections don't stand up to this period in her recording career."
4,slightly too much of a good thing,"While the highlights of this compilation (Private Life, Pars, My Jamaican Guy) are true highs, there is a surfeit of previously unreleased tracks and mixes. Programmed judiciously, this compilation is perfect for cocktails. If you're looking for something a little more recent from Grace, try tracking down her Sheep on Drugs collaboration, ""Sex Drive"", (an NME single of the week way back in '93 and AWESOME) and the pure camp of her track on the ""Avengers"" soundtrack."
4,INTERNATIONAL BEAUTY CAN ALSO SING,"Recorded at Bahamas Island studio recording retreat, Compass Point, here is a collection of long versions, never released, and dubs of songs from Grace Jones' albums of the eighties. It's wonderful. Jones always had the benefit of fine studio session players and the musical cast here shines in a dreamy Jamaican soundscape of romantic endless Summers and street-wise smarts. Her voice is sometimes zombie-like frightening as in the ominous cover of Flash and The Pan's ""Walking In The Rain"", and sometimes sedate and hypnotic as in her many excursions into sleepy French language back-up vocals (""I've Seen That Face Before""), but it is always expressive and powerful, a perfect niche to the rhythm and flow of the lush, multi-layered music. Joy Division's ""She's Lost Control"" is turned into a comedic, violent, and deliciously psychotic urban anthem and the whole CD rings with infectious grooves and sing-along charm."
4,one of their best,"Pretty much every JMC album is ""one of the best"" in my book, so I'm not sure what that means. A fantastic album by a perennially underappreciated band. ""Almost Gold"" is what rock music, intelligent rock music, is all about. This is one of those ablums that I wish I'd bought years before I actually got around to it. Don't make the same mistake."
4,Perfect pop rock,"Far Gone and Out may be one of the most perfect I'm-in-love-with-a-girl power pop songs of all time. It's certainly at the top of my list. I have pretty much included this on every mix tape I have made for friends for the past 13 years (wow, is this recording really that old?)"
4,one of their best,"This is a good Mary Chain album. It has great songs, like ""far gone and out."" It's one of their 3 best, along with ""darklands"" and my favorite, ""automatic."""
5,The Invented Fatasies Of An Oversexed Geek!!!,"This book reads like a 14 year old 's collection of sexual fantasies. The author describes his various sexual encounters in great detail (yawn) but a smart reader wil probably suspect that all the author did was masurbate excessively throughout his entire life. This book is very quaint considering the amount of pornography that can be found in movies and on the Internet today.I give this book 5 stars because I have read that to masturbate successfully one just needs a fast hand and an overactive imagination which I suspect this writer has.Not that I have any ""first hand ""(no pun intended ) knwledge of the subject!!!!"
5,Enthralling celebration of heterosexuality,"Frank Harris' tale begins with his humble origins and voyage to America culminating in financial reward and subsequent return to England. His bravado and financial capability open Harris to a world of erotic pleasure, voyage, gourmandise and to a number of encounters with interesting people of his era. Frank Harris stood by his friend Oscar Wilde until the latters' demise. Faithful both financially and compassionately, Harris is a hands down man of the world and lover of humanity. I read this book thirty years ago to much pubescent excitation and reread it a while back as a father of four and earnest husband. The effect was the same; interesting lives make for interesting people and VICE versa."
4,Garage Turbo blast..,"This band came in the late 80's from the coastal Washington town of Bellingham, with their own brand of Garage Rock, which is gutsy and incredibly enjoyable.Sin and Tonic is my favorite Mono Men album. What we have here is A high Octane turbo powered Garage monster. It ain't no 60's retro stuff, the sound is 'grungy' (after all these guys are from the Seattle area...) and in that sense it may not appeal to Garage purists.In one word: FUN !"
1,Another crap bootleg from Telavista,"When will Amazon take this company's illegal, garbage-quality DVD-Rs (they're not DVDs if you burn them in your living room from an old VHS tape) off their site?CAVEAT EMPTOR - you have been warned."
4,terrific find,"amanda plummer and bob gunton do a terrific job in this funky low budget movie shot in page , arizona.director mark romanick has since carved out quite a reputation as a music video director par excellence..."
5,The Religious Revolt Against Reason,"Was glad to receive this book, written by one of my professors at Boston University. It was a land mark book at the time, and contributed much to the discussion on the role of reason in religious understanding. It remains today a very significant book in this field of discussion."
1,Perugina Palermo,"you have to change the discription on your website that candy is not fruit filled it caffee, chocolate & hazelnut I returned it and got Capri and Sorrento instead which is what I wanted in the first place fruit."
2,Worked fine for 3-4 months,"I used this cable for 3-4 months during which I was switching the cable between the cable TV box and the DVD player while the the VGA end was connected to my projector. Recently, it just stopped working with either video source. I bought a replacement (some other generic brand) and it works fine. May be these cables are not meant to be switched between video sources too much - may be they are. Either way, here's my story."
3,"Absolute Precedence, please...","Okay, people, enough of the feigned surprise--Darklands was their first (and best) foray into feedback-less pop songs, even though S & D works more often than not.Essentially, there are tunes that could have been dropped from this album, that might have made more sense on a b-sides collection. ""Sometimes Always"", ""Girlfriend"", ""You've Been a Friend"", and ""Bullet Lovers"" work quite well, but too many of the lesser tunes feel experimental; unfinished, if you will.Overall, it's still a hell of a lot better than most of the other garbage you'll find in the racks, but it pales in comparison to the Chain's illustrious history. Buy it anyway."
3,Good Mary Chain album,"This album is ok...there are some very average songs but also some of the best Mary Chain songs they have ever written, like ""sometime always"", ""come on,"" ""never saw it coming,"" and my all-time-favorite-Mary Chain-song, ""Girlfriend."" It's worth to have this cd just for those songs, especially if you're a Mary Chain fan."
1,"Good for Managers, no for developers","This is only an introductory book in biometrics. It doesn't explains neither algorithms nor techniques, only shows some facts of biometrics. I don't recommend this book."
4,A technical guide to the future,"In light of the circumstances following 9-11, this book sheds light on the technological direction that biometrics will provide in identifying the populous.While these thoughts may send thoughts of ""Orwell"" in the minds of many readers, the benefits to be gained by utilizing biometric technology will clearly eliminate a substantial amount of fraud and identity theft within our society,While this book is technocal in nature, it is written in a non-technocal format and focuses much of the attention on the application aspect of the technology. This is a great read for the businessman seeking new venues to employ technical advances into the business process."
5,A good practical guide,"This book is a very good practical guide for all those wishing to actually implement biometric systems. It cuts right through to the practical issues and doesn't get lost in unnecessary technical detail. The example project section is especially valuable and gives a great deal of useful and practical information which is not available in purely academic works. For anyone actually designing or using biometric systems, this book is worth its weight in gold"
4,From the cover:,"From the book:This commentary on Romans is a rich gift to the contemporary church, its lay leaders, pastors, and scholars. The eighteenth volume in the Believers Church Bible Commentary Series gives new eyes for readers to see what the central message of Romans really is. Growing out of years of scholarship on Romans, the author presents a provocative reinterpretation of Paul's letter."
2,Bad Quality,"I got this for my 7 and 10 year old boys who are really into Robin Hood now. They watched the old disney movie of Robin Hood and loved it. However, the picture in this is often very dark making it difficult to see the actors. Also the sound is very bad. Some of the plots are a little boring. But I think my kids would still be okay with watching them if it was better quality. I wanted something not so violent or fraught with sexual innuendo, which this isn't. I just wish it was easier to watch."
5,Simply brilliant.,I bought this book after hearing the author speak about it on NPR. I have since re-ordered and am online to re-order again as friends who found it on my coffee table could not put it down. It's far more than the clever concept even promises. The author essentially takes you on a journey through literature and you'll see words in an entirely new light.
3,"MF Tracks Are From The Rare ""Gustav"" Session","Unfortunately Buddy and Maynard do not perform together on this CD. It's a compilation of tracks from previously released work by each performer. For MF fans, what makes this title worth the price(and a bargin at that!) is that the 3 tracks contributed by MF (Maria, Got The Spirit, At The Sound Of the Trumpet)are actually from the ""Maynard and Gustav"" session. The original Lp containing these three tracks has always been rare, and is therefore highly desireable for MF collectors. For most fans, this is the only way to acquire these performances. The music is average MF from the late 60's. Not necessarily outstanding, unless you're like most MF fans that believe that everything he has recorded is outstanding, which it usually is!Given the rarity of the tracks and low price, it's a must have for all MF collectors. The Buddy Rich tracks are average @Best, but when you're talking about Buddy Rich, his average is better than most people's finest!"
1,Failed,"After thirteen months, the fabric is failing. They typically get worn only once a week. Not acceptable for a pair of boxers that cost sixty-two dollars"
2,fail harvestmoon game,i have played almost all the harvest moon games and this one is not that fun the graphics could be better and its just an overall boring game
2,"Boring, confusing and frustrating...",This game frustrated the hell out of me. I chopped up wood and stuff for awhile and tried to make things grow but really didn't succeed. I didn't really know what to do next and wasn't enthralled with growing things or the gameplay so I quit and escorted my copy to gamestop for reselling. You can get it there :)
1,"Wonderful game, but the glitches are too depressing!","I Love Love Love this game! I have tried to play it several times, but have never gotten farther than the second year because of the game freeze! I save in both slots, only reload mid-game when absolutely necessary, but it doesn't help. I even sent my cartridge back to the company and got a new one, and it still froze. It is so depressing to have so much going... a pregnant wife, almost enough money to build a new basement, rescuing over half the sprites, crops that you've leveled up, animals that you've worked hard on and are hoping will win the festivals... and then all of the sudden it's all gone. I can't start over again. I'm waiting for the new Wii version!!"
2,"Loved it, but it froze frequently","I absolutely LOVED this game- but I had the same results as others. It froze frequently, and FOUR times it froze in both diaries, meaning I had to start all over. After the last time, I finally gave up- too frustrating. I hope they come out with a new version that doesn't have all the glitches. I would definitely buy it again (updated version) because it was so much fun."
1,Hmmm.,"Harvest moon is a great game, and I especially like this one. The con is where it freezes, and all your work is taken from you. Time after time I tried over and over, and even saved it on both files. My time was used playing this game and now it's wasted."
3,Slow text speed is killing me!!!,"First I want to say this game drives me insane for the slow text speed. I read so much faster than the very slow text that scrolls across and there is no way to skip it. It seems to take about 5 minutes of very childish text to even get into the game proper.The gameplay itself is ok. It seems that there is no point for half of the people in the town and they are just filler.The gameplay gets a little repetitive and boring. I found the Rune Factory series of games to be much better.Many aspects of the this game just seem to be way too ""cutesy"" and overly childish that it comes across as more irritating than anything.I loved harvest moon for the SNES, but this one just doesnt seem to be worth the time. Maybe I will try another game in the series.Oh, every so often the game seems to freeze up on me as well, very annoying..."
2,Game is fun until it locks up,"My daughter bought this game so she would have something new to play on a plane trip. She likes the game, but it has frozen on her several times and she loses all of her progress. She is getting tired of redoing everything just to get back to where she was at in the game previously. I don't know if there is a glitch that is typical in this game or if she just happened to get a bad copy. Based on her disappointment with this I wouldn't recommend it, and we will stay away from this series. There are just too many other choices that would likely play better."
2,Crashing all the time,I never made it past year two without the game crashing. After the third attempt I gave up and traded the game in for credit. If you don't own it don't buy it. It's not worth the twenty bucks.
2,Well...,"This game is pretty good but is very, very long! It takes forever to get enough money to buy anything and the music can get very annoying! It was a fun game but you practically do the same things day by day! I lost interest in the game after about a week.Plus when I get to a part of the game where I want to save and quit, when I come back to play the next day, my file has been deleted! This has happened to my twice now and it also happened to my cousin."
2,Fun but glitchy,"My wife is not a gamer like me, but there are a few games that she likes. She has always liked the harvest moon series. She's played it since the Super Nintendo game and she's always enjoyed it--until now.The graphics are great, the gameplay is great, the touch additions are fun at first but annoying after a while, the story is good, and the game is just plain fun.The problem is the glitches. The game locked up on her a couple of times which wasn't the end of the world but was a major annoyance if she hadn't saved recently. Then one morning, after a storm, all of her feed bins dissapeared. They didn't reapear. She was so frustrated knowing that her animals would die without being fed and there was no way to feed them.I sold the game on ebay a few weeks after that. She didn't want to start over. From my personal experience--Don't buy this game!"
2,Gliche in the game,I purchased this game for my grandson and he tells me that when he plays the game he can not restart the game won't do it. He can't save a game to start a new one. What should I do?
2,Fun with glitches! (Sarcasm),"I'VE HAD TO START MY GAME OVER 3 TIMES ALREADY BECAUSE OF SOME STUPID GLITCH!!!!!!!! It's very frustrating. It's a fun game but I think they forgot to test it for glitches. My cat is de-formed... And the heart above their head when you pet them is a messed up jumble!!! Also It's super hard to find every last Harvest Sprite, just so you can marry somone (which is also hard). It's good if your a hard core fan but other wise I wouldn't waste your money. It's a fun game, but glitches completely ruin it!!!!"
4,Granted,"Granted it does look kinda homo, but it is a great game and will burn your time away. Its little hard in the begining but gets fun after a time, highly recomend."
2,I CAN'T DO THIS!,"It's not the games fault....It's me. I can't use those directional 'thingys'. All my Nintendo DS games have been played with the stylis (sp?) What can I tell you?? I'm 65 and my fingers don't work too well at times. I have Zenes Ocean & Rainforest,Super Collapse, WordJong, Amazing Adventures-, 7 wonders- etc. So I gave it to one of my grandchildren. How can I have this not happen again? If I'd bought it in a store I could have asked about it. But I really like buying online."
1,"Fun, But Not Fun","Well, this game is a lot fun. But the thing is, it has glitches! When it froze for me, I lost all my progress, and I kept trying, but it kept freezing! When you play, you could be playing for a whole hour and it wouldn't have froze yet, and you'll be all happy thinking that you got a lucky copy. Not true. Don't take a chance. The freezing is totally random. So, if you don't mind losing all your progress and frustration all the time, this is the game for you! If you buy it, remember, glitches or fun!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"I have never played this game but a friend of mine bought it a few years ago and he loved it. UNTIL it froze on him, he lost everything he had a really nice farm lots of animals just the perfect farm. and it froze on him. Before that happened though his cat got stuck...ON HIS KITCHEN! He couldn't do anything to save his cat either :(. When it froze on him he just tossed it in the trash. I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you feel like doing a lot of work and you want to risk losing all of your hard work. Cause as far I as know it's about every 10 out of 13 games has the freezing glitch thing."
2,Frustrating after so much fun..,"My son got this game as a present, and loved it. I am a Harvest Moon fan, myself, so I played as well. We'd both made progress, but we have each had our games freeze, having to start our games all over. Seeing that this seems to be a common glitch, I just won't do it. Think I'll stick with the other Harvest Moon games. It's too bad; it's a fun game!"
4,"A bit Glitchy, but still fun!","I've been playing the Harvest Moon series for quite a while now. Everytime a new one comes out I just have to have it. It's fun and addictive. Though this one is a bit glitchy at times, ie: game freezes. I still think its a good buy. When you hook up Friends of Mineral Town or More Friends of Mineral Town into the GBA slot while you play Harvest Moon DS, the towns people from Mineral Town will come to visit you on your days off! The sad part however is that a tombstone appears near a construction site with the character you was playing on the GBA game...they killed you off! Hehe..All in all another great Harvest Moon game."
3,fun but frustrating,"I really like this game, but the glitches froze my screen numerous amounts of times, eventually you get used to it. I am 14 and I have had this game for a long time, glitches are routine for my game, but the game is one of the best, it has the layout of 'a wonderful life' and the look of 'more friends of mineral town'. I have almost all of the harvest moon games and this one is a great addition."
2,Harvest Moon... WHAT HAPPENED???,"Ok... i got the game really antcipating a harvest moon for the ds... but it is BAD. I had played the boy and girl version of the game, and LOVED them... but this... ug. The first time i played it there was no one in the town. My poor guy was all alone... so i had to start the game over. THEN it started freezing up. After those few headaches, it was ok... the new animals are fun and all, but having to manually pet them EVERY DAY is annoying. THe game is good for first-play thrills... but the long term gaming is BORING."
1,Warning- This game willl stop working unexpectedly,"There appears to be a serious glitch in this game. At some point in the game (looking at various sources online) you may no longer be able to access your save game file. A quick Google search will show that this is an extremely widespread problem, and many walkthroughs even mention this fact. Now, if this happens at the beginning, no big deal, just start over again. But after playing very close to the end of the game, my girlfriend can no longer load her saved game. From what I can tell, there is no way to recover once this happens, and you will have to start over again. I've never had to return a game before, but I am certainly making an exception for this one. In my opinion, with respect to video games, there is nothing more frustrating (and less fun) than investing many hours into a game, only to have your save file destroyed."
1,Ours keeps crashing,"Like many others, we have been unable to enjoy much of this game. At least two people in my family have been unable to get past Summer of year 1 due to the game locking up.We have several other games in the series that we have enjoyed tremendously, but this one is a real loser."
1,One Word...GLITCH!,"I had bought this game and had SO much fun playing it. The one problem was the load file glitch. I played through over half the game and saved in BOTH files and when I went to reload, the screen went blank. Apparently this is a MAJOR glitch to where you cannot get your saved files back and you must restart the whole game over again. I took the game back to the seller and they gave me another. I played the second game to near the end and it had the same load file glitch. I called Nintendo and they told me to contact Natsume and have them fix it. Nintendo also told me that I can call them back if the game does not get fixed, so there is some hope to getting it fixed, but I cannot get my progress back. It is too much hassle really. I guess it all depends on how much a person is willing to go through and how far they will go to get it fixed."
1,Stupid Game.,"I was just getting the hang of it. Spent hours into this game and I was making HUGE progress, when it just crashes. I can't load my data. The game is completely useless. I understand some copies of the game are glitched but I wouldn't take a chance.... Horrible. I've never had a game just not work before."
3,A teens point of view,Overall this game is really fun. It has a serious glitch problem though. At random times the game just freezes and it can be very frusterating. I would say that this game is worth the money and that I would reccomend it to anyone who has a love for harvest moon games.
1,awwwwwwwwwww,"I was IN this movie, and YES, it was AWFUL. One of the worst I have ever seen. Only good part was Freddy Fender playing Pancho Villa. He was really funny, but don't think they wanted him to be. I'd buy it just because I was in it, but won't watch it for entertainment value. Goes to show, with Academy Award winning stars, and what started out as a fairly good story, can end up with awful results. It has been cut, recut, rearranged and re-released with the title ""Texas In Flames"", though I can't imagine why anyone bothered. I seriously doubt the rehash is any better."
4,Nice and sturdy boombox,"Nice looks, cheaper than the equivelant Sony and does the job just as well. It's able to play my CD-R's and music burned from iTUNES.com (aac -mp4). It also has a nice little remote."
4,MP3 and WMA what?,"I purchased one of these, primarily on the basis of one of the reviews here, which claimed the player would play wma or mp3 discs, which was a feature I would have liked. Of course, I was suspicious because no where else on the internet, in any other product review or description, could I find this confirmed as a product feature. I don't know where that reviewer got his AZ3300. So, short of the fact that my own AZ3300 will play neither mp3 or wma CDs, otherwise it seems so far to be a perfectly fine player. It appears to be well built, and looks and sounds good. If it wasn't for my elevated expectations, I don't see why it wouldn't deserve 5 stars. But if you expect this to play wma or mp3s you are going to be very disappointed."
2,only one sided this is more like mattress pad,if you want pad this is the one only cover the top portionif you want whole protector where it encapsulates the whole thing. this is not it.
5,totally satisfied,"Very happy with this product. Indeed, there is no ""crinkly"" sound, and it feels very natural. It's just what I needed."
5,Pretty and Durable,"It's really pretty and still durable enough to wear every day. In fact, I never take mine off, and have never had problems with it. The texture is interesting and captures attention."
1,Pee-yew,"Do not be fooled by the blurb. This is just a run-of-the-mill porn flick with the nasties edited out - nothing more. Turns out there's a hardcore version as well, which includes all those edited-out nasties. It was not filmed, just shot on video, like all the hardcore stuff. Witty? Hardly. Wooden porn ""actors,"" minimal script/dialogue, harsh lighting, choppy editing. No cinematic value whatever. Just a feeble attempt to create an R-rated product out of an X-rated flick, I guess to pull in a few extra bucks? Where ""The Fluffer,"" by the same filmmaker, was an actual movie with moderately capable actors and standard film techniques employed, this is just a watered-down skin-flick. May as well find the hardcore version and watch that, or better still, just rent one that's better made. It would almost certainly hold one's interest longer than this throwaway."
2,Meh,"The ""plot"" of this DVD makes a unique, humorous play on ""The Ring"", but it's not to be watched for it's plot line. Some of the men are pretty hot, but ultimately this is a soft-core porn that's not really worth it. If you just like to see good-looking men pretend to have sex with one another, this is for you. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother."
2,What hole,I that here would be some campy and cheesy version of the ring. Boy was I wrong. If was a soft core porn version of the ring. I was a little upset but will keep it in my DVD collection.
2,The Hole,"This movie is so dumb it's not worth the effort I watched it and was so bored with it I mean the idea that a video will make you gay in 7 days if you watch it? Give me a break, I've seen better the plot is weak if you can call it there reeally is no plot if this is supposed to be based on the Movie The Ring forget it not even close even for a Gay Style Movie."
3,They all look gay from begining,"The concept is very good.But I don't see any difference between before and after.They all look very gay from the begining.And dropping ""DUDE"" and ""PUSSY"" here and there in the conversation will make every one straight?That is so retro."
3,"Beautiful Candlesticks, Poor Packaging","I loved these candlesticks. However, I had to send them back a few times because they were broken twice, and once I recieved a teapot (which was also broken) instead of the candle sticks. I gave up and got a refund. I suggest going to a local retailer to buy this product."
4,Jeremy Tilsen,This is my favorite versions of the classic story of Johnny Appleseed. I have vivid memories of this book as a child and I lost my copy years ago. I am glad it is still available for the next generation.
1,Very misleading,The reader expected a discussion of a religion without a deity. The author simply makes many very poor arguments for the existence of a god.
4,Lowepro Omni Sport with Sport Extreme Waterproof Hard Case,It is a great bag. I am especiel happy about the hardbox.
4,great value,"This is a great cd. Laserlight has a knack for bringing otherwise obscure live recordings to light. The sound is very good. Highlights include What Now My Love, and Lover Man , a very endearing encore during which Sassy croons ""Turn the lights down low....."" and, not being able to get them to turn the house lights down, begins to put in a few little 'sassy' quips about the situation all in a very lighthearted and endearing manner of course! Bob James supports her on piano along with Herb Mickman on bass, and Omar Clay on drums....A very enjoyable live recording by one of the greatest vocalists of all time."
2,"Maybe its me....Not a ""live"" recording fan...","LOVE LOVE LOVE Sarah Vaughan...but this is not my cup of tea... a lot of talking and band time instead of the lady just doing what she does so well. Don't care for ""live performance"" recordings and if I had known this was that, I wouldn't have purchased it. Gave it to a friend who loves Sarah so much she would probably purchase a recording of Miss Vaughan brushing her teeth."
1,Garbage,"I bought these to use on 6 AWG stranded wire. The first wire I tried these on nicked the wire. The next 2 wires I tried them on, it worked fine. After that it would never strip the insulation off the wires. I had to keep doing it over and over, twisting the tool around and around but it still wouldn't cut through the insulation all the way around. When I finally got the insulation off, it was not a clean cut but very ragged like a mouse chewed it off. Awful product."
4,Great! wish it was cheaper,This is a great analysis and overview of the Pentecostal/Charismatic churches and ministries in Ghana. Any student of religion in Africa should know this.
4,"Didn't want to like it, but I did!","After reading the description, I thought this might be a movie that treated suicide lightly. I'm happy to say that I was wrong. At first, Greta (played by Hillary Duff) appears to be a self-centered, spoiled teenager. Throughout the course of the movie, it becomes apparent that Greta has much more depth -- and has experienced much more pain in her life -- than any teen should have to deal with. But at the same time, the movie shows how the thoughtless act of suicide (or even attempted suicide) affects others much more deeply, and in ways not expected. It's difficult to tell the how, why or who else without giving away the plot. But I will say that the movie does a good job of treating such a touchy subject with sensitivity, and in a way that doesn't glamorize suicide or treat it lightly. Despite myself, I ended up enjoying this movie."
2,I wanted to like this movie,"This entirely predictable movie simply strings together one tired cliche after another. Ellen Burstyn's performance is excellent, but I had a difficult time believing Hilary Duff was a teenager, let alone a depressed, suicidal teenager. The animated diary sequences held my interest, but the rest of the movie bored me. If you're a Hilary Duff fan, you might enjoy this film, although her limitations as an actress become appalling apparent when you see her side by side with Ellen Burstyn and Melissa Leo."
4,Greta's Life Experiences,"This movie was good and meaningful. Hilary Duff played a dynamic role as rebellious, outspoken, and rude Greta. She hated her mother, her boyfriend, and pretty much everyone else. But, she realized that life is not all about her as she stayed with her maternal grandparents temporarily, found a job, met a former criminal boyfriend, attempted suicide, and so on."
3,"Bad Hilary, Bad!",Hilary dDuff plays this bratty girl that goes to live with her Grandmother. Wow!! What a stretch. Otherwise it was a typical story of an ungrateful young woman who turns around after realizing life is a gift itself and we shouldn't have to wait for life to give you something.I liked the visual storyline in how her journal drawings would come to life. Otherwise it was an OK movie.
3,nothing spectacular,"i mainly picked this up for my lil sis,and she liked it.it deals with suicide,which is a good thing because it affects so many young people in US culture today.i thought that it was basically just another after-school-special-esque teen flick,but the message is good for teens to think about:don't count yourself out of life before life ""happens""."
5,Great Movie,This is a great movie I love Hillary Duff and this was one of her better movies Watched it with family and everyone loved it...
3,Love Hillary Duff but this movie was way too dark and depressing for me.,"Thoughts of suicide are not to be taken lightly, and Hillary Duff did a great job portraying a suicical teen and is so beliveable it makes you want to cry.Way too depressing for me."
3,Not that bad but not great either,"Hillary Duff plays Greta, a 17 year old who's sent to live with her maternal grandmother by her mother. The movie is a little dark since it deals with teen suicide which Greata is trying desperately to do. The movie was a little predictable but all in all not a bad watch. I definitely won't watch it again but I'd recommend it to teens."
3,"While predictable, a lot better than I would have thought","This movie was pleasantly suprising. According to Greta is about a troubled teenager that goes to live with her grandparents for the summer and in the process finds herself and makes peace with herself.Hilary Duff, while her acting was slight mediocre, does one of her best work in this movie. In all of her other movies, this is the first one that I have seen her in where her character is very different from her previous roles. She isn't perfect in her portrayal of the role but her delivery got a few laughs from me.There were a few laughs in the movie and kept it going. However, I did find a few parts that were just unnecessary and at times, it felt like it dragged slightly. The way the story went, it was pretty predictable how it would end up. However, this was a great little journey to go on and everyone was very charming in it.Overall, I would definitely recommend at least checking out this movie. You could be pleasantly surprised."
2,I can't believe I just watched a Hilary Duff movie,"I commend Hilary Duff from breaking her teen princess mold here, but her acting leaves a lot to be desired. The story itself, about a girl wanting to kill herself before turning 18 and then finding reason to live, is nothing new. I didn't like the characters enough to care what happened to them. It's not entirely bad, but there's nothing worth wasting 90 minutes of your life over."
3,Pretty blah for Hilary Duff...,"To be completely honest...I tried to watch this movie 3 times, but fell asleep within 30-45 minutes. I usually like Hilary Duff movies and most of the romantic type comedies, but this falls short. For instance, 'Raise your voice' was a cute movie when she has to overcome shyness... 'Cinderella story' was cute because it was another remake of a lost soul finding love (I still think that Selena Gomez did a way better remake of Cinderella...)"
3,A largely conventional girl-meets-boy story,"I wasn't sure how to review this movie when I originally watched it, but after re-watching it, it's probably time to give it a try. While the title character is considerably darker than the usual Hillary Duff role, Duff does a respectable job showing a lot of teenage angst. The weakness of this movie is less the casting than the characters themselves and their story, which follow well worn conventions. We have the angsty teenager who tries to be bad, meeting the boy from the wrong side of town and finding love and hope in their relationship. Their relationship generates much of the usual cultural conflict situations have become so predictable. The only thing that redeems this movie is the arrival of Greta's mother at the end of the movie and the surprise twist at that point. Otherwise, this movie is a predictable coming of age story."
1,"Be afraid, be very afraid","Hillary Duff has portrayed such quality characters in the past. I'm surprised she took on such a dark character that displays every disgusting, disrepectful personality flaw of today's teenagers. Parents...this is not one for the impressionable teenager. This is typical of the trash Hollywood is dumping on our society these days. Where do kids get the ideas for teenage suicide, pre-marital sex, mood altering drugs, dishonoring their mother, father, employer...look no further than According to Greta."
1,My Worst Amazon Order Ever,"This is the worst item I've ever order off of Amazon. Hilary Duff has been successful, but not in this one. The pink should have given it away, but I must have been hallucinating when I ordered this superficial, boring movie."
1,I Do Not Like Covert Manipulation,"Talk about manipulating the American sheeple! A Story line about as deep as a porno film. I was expecting some serious acting by good actors; instead, the whole movie centered around the Globalist agenda of race mixing (which is part of their crazy idea of a world government; the other part being the creation of a global financial crises which seems to be working.) See this for what it is ""MANIPULATION""! If you were dumb enough to fall for Club Obama (sending 20,000 more troops into Afghanistan or sucking up to Wall street) or McCain, then you would probably like this film, I tossed it."
3,almost listennable,"Fix the errant note at 3:56 into track 3, remove the honky tonk piano crap at the end of track 5, move track 2 behind tracks 3 and 4 and you've got a listennable album."
2,Follows a scary Dream Theater trend,"The trend of turning down the bass in DT (and now LTE) recordings has reached an annoying point for me. There is a point in 'Acid Rain' where John's guitar drops out and you are SUPPOSED to be able to hear Tony grooving on the Chapman Stick. Unfortunately, the Stick was turned down so low in the mix that you could hardly even HEAR it, much like John Myung's bass notes in a live setting. If a prog supergroup is created, I want to hear individual instruments, not instruments turned down to satisfy the egos of other members in the band (and before anyone flames me for this, consider how conspicuously absent were ANY of Jon Myung's songs from the last few DT albums)."
5,Better than the first.,"In my opinion, this album is better than their first. There was a little less... experimentation, in my opinion. They seemed to have really settled in their groove and put out some great songs. It's a wonderful album. John Petrucci is a guitar god."
4,Good Direction but Falls Short of Mark,"All of these guys are amazing players...however, they lack a sense of musical direction throughout much of the CD. Track 5 (When the Water Breaks), for example, begins very promisingly. After about 4 minutes though, they resort to soloing ad nauseum. We all know that John and Jordan can play VERY fast...let's just hope that next time they save it for when it's musically called for. The shorter tracks have better sense of musical direction for the most part and the production is very good. There's also a good variety of different textures and the ease with which the group plays all of it is wonderful to hear."
4,When the water breaks...,"Giving birth includes pleasure, pain and a whole lot of pushing. If the first LTE release was the energy and power of conception, LTE 2 is the actual birth experience. The musicians are four of the best currently working in the industry and their respective skills are in full evidence with LTE 2. The 1970's progressive rock influences, from Deep Purple to King Crimson, are woven throughout. But birth brings with it some structure as opposed to wild abandon, and there are passages that feel forced (can I say over-labored?) as opposed to letting the music find it's own path. Still, LTE remains the best of the Portnoy side projects and this album has enough juicy parts to make it a must. Maybe it's not a coincidence the John Petrucci's wife gave birth during the recording sessions..."
5,perfect drug from perfect band,"unbelievable what a band , using so mach exploders and unique musical tehnique.i have been born again.perfect solos,no usefull vocals,brutal pars such as touch of NIN. don't worry be happy"
3,Deeper diversions,"Even more indulgently epic than their last gleefully bombastic rock attack, LTE's second and final offering so far was again packed with fluid dynamics capable of wowing hardened virtuoso-minded listeners, but looses some of that tension because sonic grandstanding consumes the forefront."
4,Dream Theater & Levin,"This is basically a Dream Theater album without vocals in my mind. The song ""914"" is obviously a Tony Levin song in which he shines brightly. The rest of the disc sounds like the band I know from New York without the Dream Theater vocalist. Amen. I prefer Dream Theater when they not encombered by vocals although I do enjoy some of their lyrics and their older albums. This is great stuff here though and I must give credit where it is due. John Petrucci, Jordan Rudess, Mike Portnoy and Tony Levin rock and prove themselves as masters of their individual instruments. Well worth the price. - Ciao"
5,BUY OR YOU WILL BE IN THE DARK,OK. this is very different than the original LTE but still unbelievable. listen to this and you will hear new things every time. never get sick of this one even when listened to over & over..
2,zoom,"They say the second Liquid Tension recording was spontaneous, quickly written. Sounds it ! If you own LTE-1, save you're money. LTE-2 is all energy but no melody. The first five tracks on LTE-1 are progressive masterpeices. I get chills listening to LTE-1, most of the disc is that impressive. LTE-2 is self indulgent and a disappointment after hearing their first disc. What a shame considering the incredible musical talent."
3,Take the good with the bad?,"This album -- while having ALOT of good stuff in it -- also has some shortcomings, which left me with the impression that it had been slapped together and shipped out the door without much pride of workmanship. You decide for yourself. What stands out are occasional small mistakes, the misordering of the tracks and the inclusion of a honky-tonk piano piece that should be thrown out altogether. Track 2 is much more listennable when it comes after tracks 3 and 4.The album throws in some quotes from Malmsteen and Kansas. Generally it's very listennable, and would easily have gotten a score of 5 if is wasn't for the lack of perfectionism."
5,This album is amazing...,"This honestly has to be one of the best rock instrumental albums of all time. The amazing musicianship of all four artists is downright incredible. If you are a fan of Dream Theater, even a little, you've got to have this."
3,Interesting... to a point.,"The first 1/3 of this book is rather interesting and does a decent job describing the history of and labor/love required to make Sake, but 2/3'rds of this book is a rather dry description of specific types of Sake and recommended Sushi bars in Japan.I was really wanting more of the first 1/3 of the book since I'm have no plans of traveling to Japan on a Sushi-tasting junket anytime soon."
5,"Fabulous recording, wonderful sound from HJ and the Quartet","As the above reviewers state, this is a gem. Great tracks. The playing by Hank Jones is sublime and deft, and the Meridian String Quartet do an absolutely superb job (I wish there is a Vol 2)...The recording itself is very well engineered and my only plea is ... listen to this CD on say any Hifiman portable player with either a RE 262 type IEM earphone or any decent Sennheiser: your enjoyment will be tripled."
2,"Could be great, if only they sized it properly","Columbia has yet to let me down in the quality of their clothes, durability and materials used. This shirt, is no exception. The only problem with this shirt, and it's a big one, is that the size is waaayyyy off. I would venture to say 2 sizes off. I ordered a large, as I am a large in every other brand including other Columbia product lines, but this shirt was so big I could fully loaded ruck sack underneath it!!Seriously, it is at least one size larger than labeled but I would venture to say it might even be 2 sizes too large. I'm going to give it to my dad who typically wears a XXL and see if it fits him. Bottom line, do not order this shirt online unless you have confirmed your size in a store first."
4,"Great product, although not the right size","I bought 3 of them. Great quality as we're used to when buying any Columbia stuff. But however, bigger than they seem to be. (S is like M, and so on)"
1,If you think your a large consider medium.,"Not happy with what is considered a large. I bought a columbia shirt out of a store several weeks ago. The large size fit me perfectly. I then ordered a Columbia Bonehead shirt(size large) from here. Its huge. Way too big for me and i'm 6'3"". Guess i'll start studying sizing charts."
5,Camisa Columbia Excelente para clima en Venezuela,"Recomiendo ampliamente este modelo de camisa por su frescura y comodidad para el clima en Venezuela, el color es muy llamativo y tiene esa caracteristica entre lo deportivo-excursionista y asu vez elegancia. Lo malo es que la tela se arruga mucho, también hay que tener cuidado con las tallas la L es muy grande y la M viene siendo la L."

3,3 weeks to deliver/size runs big,"This shirt is ok as far as material is concerned. As others have mentioned, the size runs ""way big.""I normally wear a large, I ordered a medium and it is still a little big on me. My complaint is the company that filled my order, Pipeline 24, had to back order it and it took 3 full weeks to get my shirt....not impressed and will not order from them again"
5,Que buen color!,"Esta camisa es muy linda, lo que mas me gusto fue el color, realmente bello, es recomendable para un presente."
5,very good,"I like and the package arrived quickly, the problem is that if you are skinny should choose the smaller size because they are very large"
3,Be carefull when ordering... size it's too big!!,Be sure to order one size smaller than ussual. I'm not sure why but size is bigger than the regular Colombia shirts!
2,yrua octavio,Good friend I am of venezuela. I write to him because I did to him a purchase of two shirts Columbias it pinches short colors red and purple.

5,GOOD,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT, I AM VERY THANKFUL, REALLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, VERY FAST, PROCEDURE WELL, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING, WE ARE GRATEFUL"
4,A little thinner than usual,"I have bought these shirts from retail stores for many years, so I thought I would try ordering a couple from Amazon (save on shipping/tax). As usual, the product arrived on the day promised, which is really no surprise - Prime is that good. The thickness of the weave is a little less than previous shirts I have purchased, but everything considered, I am very happy with the product and will buy others."
5,GREAT SHIRT,"My husband loves this shirt. Had to buy several at this price. Here in Phoenix, he needs the sun screen effect of the material. He has had skin cancer surgery and we don't want to repeat that. I wish there were more colors. The black is a lot more expensive. Maybe amazon could tell us why?"
4,Canary yellow shirt,This shirt was expensive but I bought it for a special occasion and it appears to be good quality. It is nice looking and comfortable to wear.
4,Good!!,"I like this product!, it's a great shirt!! i like the color, is a few big but is good!! fine!!"

5,Excellent,I bought them for my husband is super fascinated with the product. while going to buy new this year. She loved remain as new.
4,This is one of the most talented R&B singers out today.,"This is my favorite R&B CD of all time! Myron's voice is clearly more mature than most of the other popular singers out right now. The way he sings makes the listener believe that he means what he says. His production on this album goes hand in hand with the lyrics, which are simply outstanding. Heavenly girl is the best song on the whole album and it should've been released as a single. I think it would have went platinum. The reason the CD doesn't get a five is because of two songs: ""Hit It"" and ""Eastside Girl."" The beats are out the gate, but they don't sound right for some strange reason. They ain't that bad, they just don't match the tempo of DESTINY. The ""Destiny (REMIX)"" is a fresh song, but Timbaland is gon' kick Myron's @$$ for jackin' his style. This is the type of music that you can bump in your Jeep, or put on when you need to get someone in the mood for some sexual healin'...just skip ""Eastside Girl."" Peace!"
4,A pleasant surprise!,"Someone gave me this CD because I liked ""Destiny"" so much. I never listend to any other songs (except 'Heavenly Girl' which is similar to the title track) thinking Myron was just another ""one hit wonder"". I was pleasantly suprised to find that he actually has a lot of talent. This CD is put together nicely, there's a lot of variety but it all blends together smoothly. It hasn't left my CD changer yet, and every time I play it around my friends they want to borrow it."
5,This is an amazing CD,"If you like Eddie Palmieri, you must try this CD. It's more improvizational than Eddie's work but you will not be disappointed. Chucho is an amazingly talented artist and now this is my new favorite CD that I just can't stop listening to."
4,Bele Bele en La Habana,If you like jazz and Latin music you will love this CD. Chucho combines the two to develop a wonderful sound.
3,Interesting read.,"This book has a good story line, but it has a few problems:1. A submersible sneaks up on a high-tech submarine that can later detect submarines miles away.2. When the Red Chinese start to attack the White Chinese, the U.S. knows everything about their actions, but the White Chinese are taken completely by surprise.3. A submarine receives a message to get out of an area as fast as possible. They obey and are racing out of there when they are hit by a torpedo. Later, the captain (who escapes) says that they were at ""5 knots"". That's a big difference from the 40 knots they were really at. Not only that, but the 5 knots story is repeated twice.4. The author overdoes his desciptions. He puts a lot of detail into not only people's looks, but also things like explosions.Overall, this book could have been a lot better. I would still recommend it if you are just looking for a military fiction book to read. If you care about details, you probably would not like this book."
1,Incredible - really!,"I agree with the Folk from Nebraska. I was really disappointed with this book. The Authors website is exciting and well written. One of his other books (Pheonix/) was good enough to cause me to seek out his others. ""Piranha' is trash, pure and simple. I did read it cover to cover, but only out of idle curiousity, and a sense of'he can't really be going to do that !'.I will persevere with this author - I hope this is an aberration."
1,Even fiction must be at least credible!,"Those among my fellow reviewers that lauded this book for realism must be blissfully unaware of the most fundamental aspects of naval warfare.Imagine the largest task force of the U.S. Navy sailing into harm's way at 40 knots with no anti-submarine screen, in tight parade formation, ready for the picking. It's insulting. When you add a mini-sub docking to a larger one without so much of a ping heard in the target sub, even the base premise for the book falls through.Of course, it's the only way for Mercurio to bugle his hero like John Wayne in a bad western. While PAcino, as a recurring character should, has depth and is attaching, all other characters are pathetic one-liners. What a joke!"
5,Another Great Book by Michael DiMercurio,"Michael DiMercurio has done it again. From the opening pages the action starts, and he keeps it going right to the end. DiMercurio gives us another look at futuristic technology that may very well appear some time in the future. His knowledge of submarine warfare and the way he uses this knowledge in his books is like no other. The way he writes it makes you feel that you are there."
4,Non stop action - political/techno - thriller.,This is my first read from author Michael Dimercurio. In my opinion he ranks up there with the Larry Bond's and Tom Clancy's of this genre. The book was non-stop action from cover to cover with well developed characters (not over developed). He is most definately a good story teller - without boring you with too many details. I just purchased Barracuda Final Bearing and I'm looking forward to reading it.
5,Mr. Demercurio Keeps You Waiting For More,"I have just finished Michael's 5th book, and I loved it. It is hard to say which is my favorite. I have read Tom Clancy, Patrick Robinson, Dale Brown, and Clive Cussler; but none of them have developed such wonderful characters as those found in Piranha and the other 4. If you like adventure and great characters I recommend you pick up a copy of this today. Pleae don't forget the first 4. I can't wait until Threat Vector comes out. I have already pre-ordered it."
5,Opens the door to critical anaylses in Public Health,"This book hopefully breaks the ground for a new critical discourse within the practice of public health. A mandatory read for students of health promotion, epidemiology, and biostatistics. Foucaldian principles such as power diffusion are applied to the practice of public health, and its interaction with modern power structures. This book is a significant accomplishment."
1,DON'T BUY THIS FOR YOUR KINDLE!!!!!,"TERRIBLE formatting for the Kindle!! For example, you can't search for a phrase, since the Kindle version isn't indexed. There's no Table of Contents, and even the Contents of Authors pages aren't hyper-linked, so there's no way to even get to a specific author. I wouldn't have given it even *one star*, if I'd had that option! I have deleted it from my Kindle, and I'm glad I didn't pay much for it! What a waste!!"
1,TERRIBLE!!! DON'T BUY BEFORE READING REVIEWS!!!,"I love my Barlett's at home, the big book is great and a very user friendly reference book...the E-book version is not! It is totally unorganized, unaccessable, you cannot cross reference, no looking for title or subject...it's just a mess!!! If it wasn't such a hassle, I would ask for my money back..but it was also only a dollar. Cheap way to learn never to buy a book without first reading the reviews! I can only hope that one day they will have a better version available. TERRIBLE!!!"
2,TERRIBLE,NOT READY FOR KINDLE...IT NEEDS TO BE EDITED AN PRESENTED FOR KINDLE READING.....RIGHT NOW I REGRET EVER CONSIDERING TO BUY IT
2,Differentiate between West and East Germany (1960s),"Question 7 was made in WEST Germany, back at a time when West (non-Communist) and East (Communist) Germany were quite hostile to each other. And West Germany's film, Question 7, presents a very negative depiction of life in East Germany in the 1960s, especially East Germany's discrimination against church membership and belief in a Christian God. -- S.P. Hill."
3,Quirky but functional,"Decent cheap switch, and the auto-detection nicely eliminates the need to figure out if you need a regular or a crossover cable. Like any of the cheaper products, you'll only get a fraction of the rated gigabit speeds. The main problem with this unit is that it doesn't seem to always recognize when you've moved a device from one port of the switch to another. I find I often have to power cycle the unit in order for it to talk to something that I've plugged to another port then the one it was originally connected to. As long as you know that, it's possible to work with this box, but it's always a bit frustrating."
4,A Dodie Smith Classic,Though Pongo and Missis are exactly the BEST couple(Missis is not the sharpest tool in the shed whiel Pongo is a genious in a dog's boddie)they provide inchanting adventure's a they scearch for thier pups. Some of thier halarious adventures incloude when Missis learns right from left and when (this is not as halarious as odd soundign)Pongo puts two and two toghther tomake FIVE!Disney cut out some of the best parts and charecters! inclouding my personal favorite's inclouding the Cadpig(you can now see her in the TV show) and the pup's foster mother Perdita( though they used her in stead of Missis and changed her from liver spotted to black)!!
4,The 101 dalmations,"Pongo and Missis have lost their 15 puppies and are determined to find them. What they get instead is 101 puppies, all victims of a Cruella de Vil. Can they get back home unnoticed by her and her men?"
4,"Wonderful, charming tale","I have loved this story since I first read it as a kid. I have reread it once every ten years or so ever since. The author really captures Pongo, Missis, and Perdita as dogs in a human world. They can think and talk to one another, but they otherwise are still dogs. The love and devotion they show in finding and protecting their puppies is heartwarming to me even as an adult. I highly recommend this book to young readers and the young at heart."
4,Exactly what you would expect from Disney.,My kid loves this story (at the moment). This book is exactly what you would expect from Disney. The pictures are colorful. Good book.
5,Delightful........,"The book I read aloud to my 7 year old daughter is the 1956, 1957 Copyright with a yellow hardback cover with drawings of dogs on it. The illustrators are Janet and Anne Grahame-Johnstone.This book is fun and exciting and is more enjoyable than the Disney cartoon version. You will be surprised by the Dalmation Perdita in this book. She is not what you expect. Also, you will not find out where the ""101th Dalmation"" comes from until the last two chapters unless you are very, very perceptive. I kept coming up with 100 total Dalmations until the very end.This book is a must read for everyone; but, you will probably have to borrow it from your local library. This book needs to be rereleased."
3,Good and bad,"Overall this was a fantastic book! I rate it only three stars because of the many, rather annoying, grammar mistakes that frequently appeared throughout the ENTIRE book! Like I said though, FANTASTIC piece. I definitely would read it again and recommend it."
3,Good but not great,I just got this cd today and I like it but it doesn't have enough fast track the only fast song is Hamp's Boogie and Flying Home. I would recomend this cd if you like slow jazz songs but I would take Hamp's Blues over this one any day.
3,It depends,"This book is ambitious in scope in both good and bad ways. The value added is that the authors try to break down disciplinary walls in the study of contentious politics. However, this ends up with a broad, unwieldy framework that essentially boils down to ""it depends."" There isn't a whole upon which to base social scientific research or test hypotheses. Moreover, when the reanalyze the cases of the U.S. Civil Rights movement and the French Revolution, their ""new"" framework doesn't really add anything to the traditional version of those events. It's worth heeding their clarion call to take a more nuanced view of the interactions between identity and action in contentious politics, but this work alone doesn't really add much more to our understanding."
4,good audio,"I must admit the sound is great, the features are plentiful and the price was good. The only complaint I have is that the belt clip broke off the first hour it was being used. I tried to call Philips for 3 days to order a replacement part but their message is ""Call back later, we are exceptionally busy now."""
5,The best portable CD players,"You will read and hear that ""all CD players sound the same"", but it isn't true. Certain brands and certain models sound much better than others. Among portable CD players, the Philips models sound much better than any other brand, at any price. Philips is not as well known in America as some other brands, but they are the second largest consumer electronics company in the world and the coinventor of the CD. If you buy a Philips CD player you will hear a warmth and realism in your CDs that you haven't heard before. You will hear nuances and subtle details that you didn't know existed. Before you buy any other brand, do yourself a favor, find a Philips and play a couple of your favorite CDs - it will be a revelation for you."
5,It really is purple! (And it rocks...),"It's kind of hard to tell by the picture, but this CD player really is purple! Kind of a dark, metallic purple, but purple all the same...Prince would be proud. Anyway, about the player - I dig it! The buttons are easy to access, the sound is awesome, and while I haven't had much time to really use the thing, it hasn't skipped yet. The headphones are a nice size (can't stand those in-the-ear ones), the bass kicks, it's a quality product."
4,Time well spent,I bought this sweet book as bedside reading. It was well written and extremely sweet. Perfect for a read before bed.
4,READ THIS BOOK,How many more dimensions of true talent can this man master. This work is much better than Shopgirl and would make a great film. The only thing disappointing about the book is that it was not longer. It is fiction that captures OCD like a first hand case study.
3,"""Finally we do become wise.""","Daniel's granny always told him that ""finally we do become wise, but then it's too late."" Daniel has always believed this to be true and has resigned himself. He lives alone, and is ruled by a number of compulsions and obsessions. But he does yearn for love.The story of this gentle soul indeed engaged me. And I enjoyed the prose. His obsessions are portrayed very realistically, and indeed the world is full of people stranded by their own worries and rituals.I was bothered by the story line of his home therapist becoming so enmeshed with him personally. During a home visit, her ex husband had emerged following her baby sitter and son outside. When the ex becomes violent, Daniel comes to the rescue. Her remaining personally embroiled with him is so unethical and so irrational that I couldnt escape that part of the plot.The story of Daniel escaping his own prison is compelling, but carried on the device of the therapist's personal part of his life, I couldnt fully engage."
3,Don't step on a crack or break......,"I read ""Shopgirl"" twice. Once for the rush and second, for enjoying the morsels. ""The Pleasure of My Company"" doesn't have the strength of ""Shopgirl,"" though I enjoyed the jabs at modern LA life enough. As Daniel minces his way through his odd life, I can't but identify with life in his mind that is rehearsed oh so much. His character underlines the saying: Many terrible things have happened to me, but few have actually occurred. His most memorable quote from this novella: Thinking too much...creates the illusion of casual connections between unrelated events. So true for those of us who don't consider themselves crazy. I won't be reading this one again.I also picked up on his satirizing Mensa Institute as he did ""Mindhead"" in his hilarious and silly movie, ""Bowfinger""....which I have seen many times...and laugh through every time."
4,Many talents of Steve Martin,"I bought this book because I saw Ellen D. recommend it on her show. I got into the book very quickly, it was entertainting and interesting.The main character Daniel, who's compulsive obsessive goes through a series of funny encounters with people at his appartment building as well as his case worker. In spite of all his rules and quircks Daniel falls in love 3 times, wins an essay contest (well actually 2 since his ""alter"" ego writes the other essay), baby sits for a little boy, learns to walk across a curb and figures out his life through mathematical squares.The book is quite entertaining with Daniel having to follow all the rules in his head. However, it seems like the ending was cut a little short. The whole story unfolds slowly and then the ending seems like it was written in one hour and only takes a page and a half to explain what happens to Daniel.I recommend this book, however if you do not like endings cut short you might want to steer clear of this one."
4,A sympathetic character,"I love a book where there is so much care given the careful choice of words, the construction of a sentence, the irony of a situation, and the love of the characters.Daniel Cambridge is the unusual subject and teller of his own story, that of an obsessive-compulsive man looking for a meaningful relationship and life from a base in his Santa Monica apartment.Daniel lives much of his life vicariously, but eventually ventures out of his fantasies and into the world. Steve Martin has written a well crafted tale with wit and great observation of what it is to be human."
5,My love to Daniel (and you too Steve),"I fell in love with Daniel Pecan Cambridge by the end of the first chapter...and loved him even more by p. 172. Daniel is a character both winsome and quirky. His obsessive-compulsive disorder causes him to shut out a major portion of his surroundings...can't get over those curbs. He is infatuated with several women in his current life. But it his heart of gold that shines through and makes this a wonderful little book. When he wins a contest for ""Most Normal Person in the USA"" we laugh at the irony. His journey home is touching. Steve Martin just so subtly lets us know why Daniel is the way he is. An author who can make me laugh and shed some tears within a few pages gets a big thumbs up in my book. This is an endearing story, just a little better than ""Shopgirl."""
3,Not Martin's Best,"I get the feeling when reading this book that Martin was distracted. Perhaps he had to write this to fullfill some contractural obligation. Or maybe hwe was rushing tog et to anther project.Regardless of the reason this is far from Martin's best. If you want his best read Shopgirl.Shopgirl: A NovellaIf you want to see a largely unedited Steve Martin read ""The Pleasure of my Company."""
3,Didn't catch my interest.,The story starts out REALLY slow. I read about the first quarter of the story but it just didn't seem to be going anywhere so I stopped.
5,Funny!,He is such a great author as well as comedian and actor. This book was very interesting and definitely he has the mind of a genius.
3,Forced laughter,"Steve Martin is funny, laugh out loud funny...just not in his books. I gave it a three because the story was okay, nothing more."
4,Steve Martin can write!,"Most of us are familiar with Steve Martin the comedic actor and not Steve Martin the author. Well, it's about time we all took a closer look at Martin the author because the guy CAN write. Not only is The Pleasure of My Company well-written, but it's also thoughtfully constructed. For people who are expecting this novel to be the literary equivalent to Martin's cinematic slapstick physical comedy will either be pleasantly surprised or sorely disappointed. TPOMC has a Zen-like quality to it, which originates from the character's constant and often witty introspection. This calmness is in direct opposition with the character's numerous disruptive habits stemming from his OCD and the problems that arise from this conflict, along with the character's steady transformation, makes for a delightful and entertaining read."
1,Get on the court in life!,"While I haven't read Steve Martin's first book, this book was horrible! I'm not interested in the thoughts and delusions of this character who's obsessions and psychoses rule his boring, mundane life. I'd rather read about someone who gets on the court and plays the game of life, not someone who lets life pass them by."
3,More Thoughtful Than Funny,"The Pleasure of My Company is Steve Martin's second novel. Like his first novel, Shopgirl, it is set in L.A., a place Martin knows inside and out. The main character is Daniel Pecan Cambridge, a real oddball who lives and breathes math and wishes only to live in peace in his strange little world in his apartment. By a series of events, Daniel is forced out of his world and into the real one. Many new friends and a bad enemy help him through his terror into trying to find a place in society.Daniel craves the companionship of a beautiful woman, and many hilarious events ensue that had me laughing out loud and reading some of the book to my husband. The book mirrors life in many ways, parts of it achingly bittersweet. A good, quick, light read."
4,"Martin's is a Weird, Deep Mind","I like Steve Martin. I like his movies, particularly ones such as LA Story and Bowfinger which give you a view on how he views the world.""Pleasure"" is like this but on a much different scope. We sometimes view celebrities as having it all together but reading this book gives you a view of the insecurities and depth of Steve Martin's mind.But in the end I must be entertained. I found the first part of the book slow and slightly confusing. But after the set-up, the character development is excellent as you search for the subjects that you most identify with. And, of course, Martin's dry-witted humor is sprinkled throughout and quite entertaining. By the end of the book you are emotionally attached to the characters and enjoy the contrived, happy ending. While I was not bowled over by the book, I did enjoy it. It is a very short read."
5,Best explanation of OCD in a novel,"This book is an easy read about funny/sad things that happen to a young man who has isolated himself from the rest of the world. I love this book because it shows how obsessive-compulsive behavior works. If you've got some OCD going on, it's a much easier book to read than the heavy self-help books, because Martin is so funny. It's helpful to be able to laugh while you're reminded of how you've distracted yourself from fundamental psychological problems by the rituals you've created. Many of us don't do the ""typical"" OCD stuff like wash incessantly or fear germs, and so people have no idea that other rituals are locking up our brains. If you don't have OCD, you might come away with a better understanding of how it works."
4,give it a chance,"Steve Martin has an incredible way with words. Even with his works that I don't particularly enjoy, his use of language shines through, along with his keen sense of observation.I almost didn't finish reading this book because I found the first 20-30 pages fragmented, and perhaps a little condescending toward its protagonist. I persevered, though, and was rewarded with a satisfying story.Heck, just reading about Daniel's trips to Rite Aid is worth the price of admission."
4,The sweetest book I've read in ages.,"I read this on audio and found it thoroughly charming. The main character is so odd and quirky and his little obsessions and thoughts about the women around him had me smiling all the way home (and that's a rarity as my drive is a nightmare!).Daniel, the narrator, has these odd little neurosis. He can't walk off a curb like most people (at least without a whole lot of anxiety), he has his house set up so that the bulb wattage equals a certain number at all times (this causes a major glitch when he attempts to have a little liaison with a lady who wants the lights dimmed) and he suffers a few other oddities that make his life quite difficult but also quite funny to those reading his tale. When he makes an attempt at running and soon after suffers the consequences it's hard not to laugh at his folly.This book was so very sweet and a pure pleasure to read. I'll have to look up more of Steve Martin's fiction"
3,"funny and likeable, though truly pathetic character","I was really rooting for this guy who struggled with maneuvering his way through life, relationships, and everything else. Steve Martin has a great sense of humor, and he captured a lot of the hilarity that goes along with mental issues. If you can't laugh, you'll cry. This book is not terribly memorable in the long run, but it was very enjoyable. A nice, light read for a rainy day."
2,I feel like a traitor...,"I tried to read this, but it didn't grab me. But since Steve MArtin is one of my favorite actors/comedians, I thought that maybe listening to the audio book, read by the author would do the trick. I listened to 3 our of 4 CDs, which is more than I'd read. Try as I might, I just found Daniel's neuroses and compulsive behaviors more disturbing than funny. Forgive me, Steve MArtin. May I be a fan of your theatre, and not your books?"
3,Not worth the read,"I love Steve Martin, but this book I have no affinity for. I did not finish the book, which is rare for me, but I just could not get interested."
3,Meh,While I've loved Steve Martin since he broke through on Saturday Nite Live--back in the day. This was mildly entertaining and somewhat annoying for all the neuroses discussed. I Give it a Meh--I guess I cant complain as I got it on a Daily Deal--
3,probably 3 and a half stars,"The style and subject of this one made me think of the Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. It was almost as though the boy aged 20 years and here is his life now. However, the tone of the book is very different and much more enjoyable.Two things keep me from raising this to 4 stars. (1) Knowing the author was Steve Martin and it being written in first-person, I heard the comedian's voice in my head. This would have been fine, except many things came off as jokes that weren't actually written as such. Maladies which the protagonist struggled with had a stand-up's delivery. Also, the age and image was always wrong for the voice. (2) The character's neurosis could have been mine if things had been slightly different in my life. I don't like to think of myself as crazy, and books like this one show me to be small steps away from medication and counseling.3 and 1/2 stars."
2,Pretty boring,"I found the book rather timid and boring, with trite situations and surface psychology that didn't really delve into anything profound. The main character is basically Forest Gump, but with an uneventful life and no discerning characteristics to make him interesting. I thought the title and cover art were interesting, and those were the reasons I checked it out. It was a mistake. I still think Steve Martin is a great comedian, but this book has made me wish that he would stick to his strengths."
4,I loved this book!,"This novel is so endearing. I wondered where it was heading in the first few chapters, but in the end, Martin wraps it up full circle in a way that only American novels do best. I highly recommend it!"
2,not a good read,"Love this man as a comedian, an actor, anything ""live"", not so much as an author. Is this the same guy?"
3,Definitely Hollywood Material,"It was an easy read and it made me laugh. Those are undervalued qualities and they make the book worthwhile. However, the ending is ridiculous and spoils the whole process. The reviewer who labeled it as ""Hollywood"" was right on target!"
1,Not what I'd hoped,"Steve Martin has always been among my favorite comic actors and performers, so I greatly looked forward to this book. Unfortunately I found it practically unreadable. Perhaps my taste in humor has changed, but there always seemed to be an edge to the silliness in Martin's performances. The edge is missing here. I don't abandon many books without finishing them, but this is one that I did."
2,not the most likeable main character,"As with other reviewers, I was seduced by Steve Martin as author as well as the joy I found reading Shopgirl. Alas, there is no joy in Daniel Pecan Cambridge's world for him or for me. I didn't find the prose that humorous at all, and the main character was rather pathetic. And not in a sad, I feel sorry for him, way. Mostly I found him annoying. I felt like slapping him and saying, you dolt, it's just a curb, step over it and get on with your life. Moments were amusing, but with the central character being quite unlikeable, I found the reading a chore and I just didnt care what happened to him."
2,"It is a bad version of ""The Jerk""","This literary version of ""The Jerk"" never gets going for me. It starts off as a monologue and since I know Steve Martin wrote it the image I got in my head is of Steve on stage telling me this story. Once a few characters are introduced they have no depth or real life. As the books goes on the story never progresses. The main character has no conflicts to change is character. He has a few obsessive compulsive issues to deal with but they mysterously dissolve by the end of the book. I found the ending to be particularly bad. The main character's problems are solved and he finds true love in a terrible final 10 pages. This was a story about a wierd guy who has some mildly humurous episodes and then gets better. Who cares?"
3,"OK, I GUESS","It's a fun, interesting read while passing time on the bus or in the doctor's office. I suppose I would call it 'comfort reading' to help pass the time, and easy to pick up whatever page you were on. I expected more from Steve, but then maybe my expectations are too high after ""Shopgirl,"" which I found insightful and profound as to what happened to the young lady. The protagonist in this little novel left me torn between sympathy and laughter - it must be hell worryng about curbs and being out in public. The ending seemed like it was created to meet a deadline - too fast and unbelieveable. Worth reading for me in two medical visits - would I recommend it to others? Probably not - not one of my favorites by any means - average attempt. I left it on the hospital bench for the next interested reader."
4,A fun ride into OCD-land,"I actually really enjoyed this book. I'm a bid SM fan and so I love that I could envision him in the main role. So much so that this happened: I read the book several years ago and just the other say was talking about it as if it was a movie, surprised to find out that a movie had never been made of the book!It was an easy read and a fun, thorough jaunt into the mind of someone with severe obsessive-compulsive disorder. It was sad, of course, to share his frustration at not being able to be the person he wanted to be. But I loved the surprisingly compassionate moments that different characters showed. It's a good one. Best book ever? Probably not, but I really enjoyed it."
5,Perfect combination of instramental surf and low brow jazz!,"Impala was the greatest, and easily the most underrated of the recent instrumental surf revival, and to me this is their greatest album. Slow, sensuous, sleazy sax over the fast pulse of a great rhythm section. Exotic, melodic guitar riffs instead of the usual tube-amp thrash that tries to pass itself off as surf these days. This album creates a beautifully sleazy, neon-lit pulsating world. My second favorite instramental album, next to (the)Ventures In Space!"
2,Ok but not great,"In order to really get the most out of these recipes , you need to purchase a lot of liquid vitamins/proteins ETC...The rest is really just your regular fruit, milks/replacements/ and really nothing new!!!"
2,Depends on what you want,"This book has a few too many ""protein powder added"" recipes. We wanted ideas for fruity smmoothies and frozen coffee ideas. I should have read the reviews!"
1,Don't get this !,This is so horrible that it's laughable.The pressure to change style in 70's and become the new Buddy Rich to target the new generation comes across as a make it up as we go along Jazzrock Funky Blues sound which makes a jazz fan want to puke.
3,GOOD AND BAD,"This is a good ablum but not great, I was disappointed in the quality of the songwriting, the songs themselves are just too uneven. That is not to say there are no great songs, there are several."
3,Good...but still dissapoints,"If you love the demo version of some of the songs in the album, don't be suprised if you don't like this one.The first two track really blows me off. But Despite The Waves and Ashen Days really dissapoints me. The demo version was perfect. It has identity. With the change, that seems to incline towards sounds of DT, they were like any other progressive band. I only love track 1,2,7 and 10. Track 9 is great until it reaches the chorus.Individual talents though are fantastic. If you love DT's FII, you might love this one. If not, just listen to track 1,2,7,10 and forget the rest."
2,total Dream Theater ripoffs,"It is not unfair to compare this album to Dream Theater, because it is entirely and completely a ripoff of the ""Images and Words"" sound. If all those tired generic progmetal tricks still turn you on, maybe this album will be OK for you. But in my view there is much more important stuff on this planet: Arcturus, Opeth, Nevermore, Mekong Delta, Therion,... Dream Theater themselves for that matter."
1,Thank god this is out of print hopfully it stays that way,"The first BWP was an amazing piece of filmmaking, naturally frightening....this pt,2 is unnessary and and horribly crappy movie....avoid like the plague if you buy a copy somewhere in a bargin bin or someone beg you to take their copy jsut burn it and pray it stays dead..."
3,"While Cheesy, Book Of Shadows is OK.","The main problem with Book of Shadows - Blair Witch 2 was that it filled a fairly good idea with loads of cheese, and made it look somewhat cheap.The basic plot line for the film was OK. The unseen force that was causing all of these strange occurances made it somewhat facinating to watch & the ending was satisfying enough.But I think that had the project taken more time to develop, and not be thrown together so fast to capitalize on the the first one's success, it would have been a far better film, & a lot more worthy to be the sequel to the 1999 Original."
1,garbage,okay the first was awsome but this is garbage it made no sense and followed nothing from the first go see charlies anglies d
3,"Not great, but could have been worse...","The most original thing about The Blair Witch Project was that it appeared to actually be a real documentary. Well, this isn't the case in BW2. So you could expect that that the sequel lacking the most interesting aspect of the original film would be awful - but, actually, it isn't. I wouldn't say that it is an extraordinarily great movie, but it is good fun. I think that the only problem about it is that it has no real high point, lacking a furious showdown as it is typical for a horror movie. But this film is really okay."
2,"Not bad, not great, not related to the first movie either","Boy, what hath the box office wrought? This wasn't a bad movie, but its title was kind of deceptive. On its own, it wasn't bad, but it couldn't be considered much of a sequel. That said, it WAS suspenseful, but nothing original or truly stick-with-you frightening."
1,horrible!,here we are to rate this sort of horror film.is this a horror film?or better.....is this a film?i don't think so cos everything is just so bad made that the movie can only make laugh!believe me when i say it's no reasons to be seen...if u wanna have a nice time u'd better go buying something else such as a comedy......don't u?1 star is just too much.........
3,Calm down ...,"Naturally, the sequel didn't engage viewers and critics like the first one. It rarely ever happens. More typically, as is the case here, the long knives are out BECAUSE it's a sequel. (Case in point: ""Fire Walk With Me,"" a great movie, was savaged because David Lynch had the audacity to revisit ""Twin Peaks."") The main problem with ""Book of Shadows"" is the acting, which ranges from acceptable to pretty bad. Presumably, the director wanted a no-name cast for that cinema verite feel, but these guys aren't at Heather Donohue's level. But if you can look past that, the script did an excellent job of not botching the mythology (leaving the door open for more movies, if that's still financially possible), and exploring interesting themes about perception, group hysteria, possession, cultish behavior, obsession, etc. Not a lot of great dialogue, but a fascinating premise that is not deserving of the routine dismissal the film got."
2,Reefer Madness in the Woods,"Five twenty-somethings go to the woods to have a party. They smoke some bad grass and drink too much alcohol. They have a bad trip, kill some bystanders and a few of their own. They sober up the next morning and face the stern gaze of authority.Basically, this movie is a long anti-drug message. During the overlong passage between the start of the party and the dry-out, nothing you see actually happens.Why film it at all?(I give this film two stars because The Haunting (with Liam Niesson) is actually much, much worse)"
1,Really doesnt live up to the original!,"This movie was awful! It was boring, the acting was bad, and it was completely confusing! They barley mentioned the blair witch and it did not follow the first!!! I loved the first and thought it was really creepy! This, not so much. I would avoid if i were you."
1,The worst sequel.,"The one star I give this ""film"" goes to the first Blair Witch, NOT this one! This film is almost not worth the time spent watching it! If you liked the first one like I did, then do it and yourself a favour, DON'T SEE IT!"
1,One of the all time worst films ever made,"I remember sitting in the theatre on opening night, mourning the loss of my 9 bucks over this POS. Yes, its entertaining in a trash film kind of sense. I mean, who would have thought the Blair Witch was so proficient at graphic design and video production? What trash. Not even the topless scene helped. Wait, I lie, it did help tremendously. Wait, was there a topless scene? Maybe I'm confusing it with something else, it was THAT bad. Either way, a little skin is all this movie had going for it... and if thats what you're looking for you can find many better choices. You're on the internet, after all."
1,absolute insult to the origional!,anyone who likes this sequal (i don't even consider it a sequal to BWP)is mentally retarded...or just like crappy movies.
4,I liked it,"This film does what no other sequel has done: it comes right out and TELLS you, right off the bat, that the first movie was a work of fiction, and that the second movie was a ""dramatization"" of the events that happened following the release of the first one. In other words, BOS is a very subtle satire on the films that get made to cash in on national phenomena, and I find that very clever. It also stands up on its own terms. Sort of. Anyway, the movie has a sort of nested irony that I enjoyed, as well as a few genuinely scary moments. The DVD also has the complete soundtrack on the other side! Very clever."
3,BETTER THAN THE FIRST,"This movie was interesting and watchable, not like the original which gave me a headache in the theater. The premise of Blair Witch Project was great, but so poorly executed. It was so boring. Are we supposed to believe that these are film students when they can't even hold their cameras still? This sequel is typical horror fare, but I liked the story and the acting was much better than the original. The script was better also, it at least refrained for using the F word in every sentence. Question: After the hallucination with Stephen and Erica at the table, the word NO appears on the window behind them. That wasn't listed in the clues. Also, I don't understand the letters OR on the rug. Can anyone give insight?"
1,WARNING: This sequil does not co-exist with the origianal...,"...only the legend. But thats not good enough. When I waited for a sequil to ""The Blair Witch Project"" I was hoping that it would contunue where the first one left off. But Joe Berlinger was so obsessed with realism that in the plot, the original was just merely a movie. Now i just have one question for Joe: In the BW2 universe, if the legend was real then how could the actors/filmmakers come out of it without even a scratch. But, noooo, not these kids in this one, they were affected by the legend and 2 died. Sounds like a mjor plothole to me, Joe. For true fans of the original, I plead, FORGET THIS ONE!!!!!"
1,The worst sequel I have ever seen,"This movie was just horrible! None of the horror and frights of the original, just a bunch of weird, mind-distorting imagery. I didn't get it.I intensely disliked the way the movie harped on the strictly fictional quality of its predecessor. The greatest beauty of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT lay in its simulated real-life qualities. BLAIR WITCH 2 completely debunked this aspect of the first movie, which I think stole a lot of the first movie's thunder."
2,It's Ok But You're Not Missing Much,It was an OK movie. I've seen much better horror films. This one had only a couple of scenes that made me jump and only a few scenes with special effects which is disappointing. I can see why critics give it a poor rating because it can be lagging in some parts. There is no plot and they could have made it more exciting. I preferred the first Blair Witch to this one. The ending of this movie is extremely disappointing. Rent it but don't buy it.
2,Mediocre horror flick,"I went to see this and I thought it was pretty bad. Then I watched some other recent movies and realized, well all in all it was not that bad. The story is ok, the acting is TERRIBLE. I would not let young children see this film because parts of it are disturbing. I really do not know how to review it because it was not great and not awful..somewhat mediocre. If you love horror movies, watch it. If you don't, avoid it at all costs."
1,"Hollywood works it's ""magic"" once again","This is a good example of Hollywood taking a successful cult film and making a sequel that doesn't have any of the attributes that made the original so good. It's also a good example of Hollywood throwing a lot of money at a project without earmarking some of it for a decent script. Did the filmmakers get greedy or lazy? It's hard to tell. Probably both. Instead of rehashing what was bad about it, I'll tell you the one good thing about it: it's over."
4,Unfairly judged,"Blair Witch 2: The Book of Shadows is an innovative and exciting film. The movie is extremely profound with thought-provoking themes: What is reality? Is what we see every second of the day merely what our mind concocts? Granted the movie takes this theory to the extreme with its plot-twisting finale, but it definitely affects how you view your everyday life.Blair Witch 2 wasn't the best film and has its flaws, such as its lack of character development, but the film's rawness and relentlessness is impressive and captivating. Most people who didn't enjoy the film were either expecting to be scared witless or constantly compared the film to the original (which I haven't seen) or they didn't bother to appreciate the underlying themes of the film. Everyone has their own opinion. Everyone should see the film and decide for themselves."
5,Simply Great!,"I wish people would stop analyzing every tiny detail. Movies were not created to imitate reality. If they were we'd have an awful lot of boring movies. I think this movie was great. The ending was a complete surprise. Things may not be as cut and dry as they appear. The plot was quite clear and the movie did indeed have one. If people would stop looking at every small detail like the lighting wasn't perfect and gee it just didn't have the same scare factor as it's predesesor, they'd see that for a sequel this was in fact a really well done movie. You simply have to relax and enjoy the movie for what it is, a movie. I saw nothing wrong with the acting and I think they did a really good job."
4,Can Hype Kill?,"Don't get me wrong this was a decent movie for all the Blair Witch fans (myself included), but I don't think that this movie lived up to the hype the first one set for itself. Granted I haven't seen it on DVD, yet, but I will. Chances are I'll buy this movie, and yet I feel a little let down. Like I said before it was a good movie, it just could have been a lot better. The movie will constantly have you guessing, which isn't always good. You may find yourself lost due to the constant jumping, which really kills some great angles they were working. If you don't mind the jumping, you pay close attantion, and have a lot of patience then you will enjoy this movie as I did. Others may want to stick with the first one though."
4,Disposable Teens,"This movie had me thoroughly engrossed and kept me guessing the whole time. It wasn't completely scary or anything, but the pyschological aspect was enough to intrigue me. The setting of the film was horrific, it's always a creep out when your stuck in the middle of the woods with no one around... I really liked the dialogue of the film, the actors were right on the mark. I especially liked the performance by the ""gothic"" girl, the one who wore all black. I though she was a great actress and I hope to see her in futrue films. A decent movie."
1,Soulless and cynical cash in attempt.,"A style over substance dud that worships at the alter of by-the-numbers formula. The characters are (annoying) stereotypes, suspense is non-existent, and the plot insults your intelligence.It has nothing to say, except ""give me your money""."
3,"Not as good as ""The Bare Wench Project""","The first time I watched this, I thought it was pretty lame. After watching it again, I think it was a little better. The ending was totally unexpected (the first time I watched it)."
4,Better then the first....,I've read over some of the bad reviews of this movie and personaly after seeing the first one never gave this one a chance until it came out on pay tv. There were a couple good scenes in the first movie however I found myself feeling betrayed by all the hype and not really scared at all. The strongest feeling I recall from #1 was wanting to punch that whiney girl in the face while she was crying in the camera. This movie however I found a few chilly scenes a nice camp fire bloodbath and true to any demonic/devil worship/witch craft....the infomous playing of the tape backwards scene....I prefer this over the first one any day as the only enjoyment I got out of number one was hanging stick men in the woods and then tricking friends to come out there with me....
1,There is to many things wrong with this to even begin,"This is your typical horror sequel. There are so many things wrong with this movie that I can not even begin to describe it. Lets start with the plot.The story takes place one year after the first (Typical) and after a few interviews with the residence of Birkettsville we find out that they are taking the ingural tour of the Blair Witch Project. From there we are overwhelmed with random scenes of violence, nudity, gore, and stupidity. THere are around 8 killings which ranks up to a typical 80's slasher film.I don't even know who stars in thsi piece of trash. Obviously peopl who can't act because it is that bad.The movie stole effect ideas primarily from Event Horizon, House on Haunted Hill, and Blair Witch 1 and it is easily obviouse that they stole effects ideas from other movies as well.To wrap things up simply avoid this movie, it is not worth the time or effort to sit through and watch. It's boring, pointless and stupid."
4,Lighten Up,I was disappointed with The Blair Witch project after all the hype. I didn't expect much from the sequel. Maybe that's the answer. We should stop trying to be Siskel and Ebert and just watch the movie. I found it to be fun which makes it better than 90% of the movies I have seen in the past five years. I wasn't expecting Gone With The Wind. It was a good horror movie. What's wrong with that?
1,Worst movie I ever sat through.,"Ok,so I didn't walk out.I kept thinking it had to get better,or would start making sense,or some plot detail would explain why the acting was so stilted.And then it was over.The movie seemed to be incomprehensible garbage."
5,The best in the trilogy.,"This is by far the best movie in the Blair Witch trilogy.The first movie was good,but this passes the first in every way.The script was good,and the horror is great.Buy this great picture on DVD,so you can enjoy that loud theater sound."
2,JOE BERLINGER'S COMMENTARY BETTER INCLUDE AN APOLOGY,"How dare Berlinger destroy the wonderful and imaginagtive worldof Blair Witch with this ... piece of ... . Feeding off his previous overrated documentaries, and mocking the people he allegedly supported - he manages to ruin a franchise, embarass fans of the original BWP and justify those who backlashed the amazingly refreshing and original first film. I will buy this DVD if only to hear him apoligize for Book of Shadows. (Yeah, I don't know what the Book of Shadows was either - maybe he saw an episode of 'Charmed' before pulling this movie out of his nethers.)"
2,What the...?,"Was this a horror? Was this a comedy? Was this a statement against violence in movies? It sure wasn't a worthy sequel to the original BWP. It didn't capture any of the same mood, wasn't consistent at all with any of the atmosphere in the first movie, and sure as heCK didn't capture any of the pure terror that was so evident in the first movie. So what does this film do? It might keep you guessing as to when there's a scare, but there aren't any scares. It might try and make you care about the characters, but none of them are worth the viewer's time. It might attempt to get you sucked into a plot that is never explained and completely shot to heCK by the terrible ending. The beginning of the film is however an excellent piece of filmmaking, the rest though is just crap. Stick with Metallica Some Kind of Monster for a good Joe Berlinger movie. This movie is not worth it."
2,"May Not Be As Good As The Original, But Still Worth A Rental","As I began to watch The Blair Witch 2:Book Of Shadows, I thought to myself that this will be a disappointing sequel. I thought this because; this isn't low-budget like the first one. Also because it says this one is completely fictional. As I progressed through this film, I found it non-scary and just pointless. However after I watched the ending to this film I was amazed. I thought to myself ""How could the ending have so much creativity, but the rest of the film dosen't at all?"" I enjoyed only one portion of this film and that was the ending. The ending was sheer brilliance! It was creative and suprising. A completely unpredictable ending. So I give this film two stars for the ending only."
4,"Not ""Blair Witch"" but still a good flick","I think this movie is very underrated because it flopped at the box-office. There are three reasons for this: 1. Many people hated Blair Witch and no way were they interested in seeing the sequel. 2. Many other people loved Blair Witch, and this sequel isn't exactly a sequel so they were turned off. 3. The director's approach was too minimal, and the studio's interference too ridiculous, making a movie ""neither fish nor fowl,"" not true to the director's vision or the studio's desire. As a huge Blair Witch fan I was disappointed because the sequel isn't scary (which BW1 definitely was). But this movie is still very interesting and I have watched it many times on DVD without getting bored. The only things both movies have in common are the setting, title and ""is there a witch or not"" ambiguity. I feel that suspense fans who give this movie a chance on it's own, without comparing it to Blair Witch, will enjoy it."
3,"Not as good as the Blair Witch 1, but still creepy","Of course, when you watched it once, it's not as fun to watch it again, but it's still a good one for a horror movie night. Has nothing really to do with Blair Witch 1 - neither style wise, nor the content wise. It's kind of a different movie. even though it's kinda about the same thing. It's actually not."
1,Book of Shadows,"I thought the first Blair Witch Project was an exception film. This movie here, it is not exceptional. In fact, I think the word 'disgraceful' is much more fitting. I'm not usually one to come down hard on movies, as I at least appreciate the effort... Usually! This film has No originality, an atrocious 'story-line', and is just all a round dumb. It's something conjured up to cash in on the success of the first Blair Witch. Yeah, I know sequels usually do suck and all, but I haven't been this disappointed by a film in a long while. I can?t find anything redeemable at all about The Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2... Possibly the sound track? I don't know; I wouldn't buy it because it'd remind me too much of this film. Like the viewer from Toccoa, GA said: if Mystery Science Theatre 3000 were still around, this would definitely be on their screen :)."
1,What The...?,"Where did it all go wrong? I dunno...I was really looking forward to this film seeing that I loved the original and it creeped the bejeezus out of me...So, the 2nd one has to be at least a little bit good, right right? Wrong-o! Man, I tell you, this has got to be not only one of the worst horror films of all time, but yes, one of the worst films in general of all time too. Yup, it's that bad. Where's the scares? Where's the atmosphere? ... I'd even settle for ...jumps...But where are they? Well they're not in this ridiculous excuse for a moving picture. I'm convinced that this is some guy's idea of a practical joke...Trying to make a sequel in the real world following in the footsteps of the characters of the first movie...So we're like watching a movie in a movie ... Just go watch the first one again..."
3,Disappointing at the end!,"Although it begins with nice prospects and great soundtrack, while the plot becoms even more complicated and confusing and makes the audience expect a unique ending...it stops and you are left wandering what really happened, without being given enough evidence to examine it! Again it is realistic enough and basically makes you question your IQ sometimes! Generally a good movie, especially for goth fans! It has its good and its bad side, which just don't differ so much!"
1,"Wow, this one was bad.","Look, the first movie was scary in its own creative way. This movie is not scary--it is boring. There is a very annoying Wiccan girl that never shuts up about being a Wiccan. The movie is very disjointed and difficult to follow at times. The plot is so hollow and uninteresting that it seems like the script was written by a couple of high-schoolers working on a project for media class. I do think that the cover of the box is very cool, though."
3,Better Than The Original,"I didn't want to watch this at first because the original movie was so bad (it just wasn't scary, it was boring, and the characters were so idiotic and annoying I spent the entire movie rooting for the witch, hoping she would kill them quickly). I finally relented and rented this one. It is by no stretch of the imagination a great horror film, but it at least had some suspense which is something the first movie lacked. I'm glad I didn't watch it in the theater but it was a decent rental."
1,"I would have given 1/2 a star, but that was not an option",Blair Witch 2 is the antithesis of everything that made Blair Witch 1 so great.
4,Blair Witch 2 - much better than part 1,"I rented both parts 1 and 2 of Blair Witch so I could watch them together.I didnt like part one at all. The characters were extremely annoying. I already knew about the handheld camera style of filming but the whole film (part 1) just made me angry.Part 2, on the other hand, was pretty good. The first half or so had too much cussing and it was disjointed but then things started to come together a bit and I got pulled in. I love the way reality wasnt always reality.I'd watch this (part 2) again. Part 1...no."
5,a worthy sequel.,"I never understood why everyone hated this. I saw it when it came out and I was in 8th grade at the time. Everyone at the theater left saying ""what the hell was that?"" and ""that sucked!"" I walked out awestruck and thoroughly impressed. Just because it's a departure from the original doesnt mean its bad AT ALL. Honestly, incredibly underrated. Don't listen to what ANYONE SAYS! Judge for yourself!"
3,"Not as good as the first, but worth a rental!","Of course no one should have expected this one to be as ""good"" as the first. With all the hype and originality of the first Blair Witch, this one was inherently going to be tough to follow. In the sequel's defense, however, I really found this one to be better than I expected. There are more than a few scenes and moments that were surprisingly original, and the ending was clever. I have actually seen this a few times now (not in the least due to the attractive Goth character LOL), and it's still an interesting viewing. I'd definately recommend it for the horror fan in your life.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for..."
2,"Psychological thriller with attitude, hokey characters","The sequel to BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (an okay horror movie representing a triumph in marketing skill) is a gutsy departure from the first, in style, form, and tone. Instead of a ""horrormentary,"" this is a straightforward psychological thriller which jars the narrative with hallucinogenic red herrings and fantasies that may or may not be clues to what is going on.There is also some wit in the film's conceit, which centers on a young man who makes money off the BLAIR WITCH phenomenon by selling merchandise and giving tours of the woods.Unfortunately, the characters are so hokey and two-dimensional there is little suspense for them. One simply waits to see how the film will play out. Also, the sequel is taking what plays like a conscious slap at critics of the first film who protested the stereotyping of witches, by feasting up an even bigger stereotype."
2,Could have been..,I truly don't know what to say about this movie! You can sense some hard work and a chance that it could have been better... but mainly I blame the Screenwriter for messing it up! So what has badly affected the movie?1. Extremely bad screen script! You waste most of the time trying to focus on what is happening because from the first ten minutes you keep seeing flashes from parts of the movie that took place prior and after where you at! And you fail to get the picture until the end.2. The suspense of the movie is ONLY in the first half hour (while in the woods) but afterwards; both suspense and thrill are lost.3. There is no scary OST in the film that can drive the thrill up.4. The actors fear and reaction was not convincing (except at the police station / at the end of the movie).5. Oh the end of the movie..! That was ... (I'll leave that to you to judge)!The reason I rated this movie two stars was because I know the story could have been put in a better way.
3,"Fairly good ""sequel""","On par, this sequel has absolutely nothing to do with the first ""Blair Witch Project,"" which was simply a great innovative approach to horror films. But this is mainly entertaining all by itself, only naming the three students in the first film and nothing more, except adding onto the faux myth of the Blair Witch, that much is evident.The plot is original, though it's filled with blood and gore, for mainly horror slash-'em-up flicks, but some tightly woven suspense and the finale are a plus. If you're a die-hard fan of the fabled 1999 faux ""documentary,"" you'll probably be disappointed. If you're a casual viewer, you might think better of it.The movie is good, just not as good as the first and is a far cry from being a superb horror film, like ""Halloween"" and ""An American Werewolf In London,"" but it's still fun entertainment.Rated R for horror violence/gore, sexuality/nudity, drug use, and for language."
1,Stupidest movie ever made.,"This movie is the stupidest movie ever made in movie history.This movie has everything that can be bad.Bad script,Bad acting,Bad lightning,Bad cast,Bad characters.Don't watch,see,or even be near this trash."
4,"Great, but nothing to do with the first one","This is an entertaining film, but it has nothing to do with the original. This is not a mocu/documentary, but a mainstream attempt at a horror film. They claim to run expeditions through the same woods where the original folks supposedly died, but, imagine this, bad things happen. The acting is mostly terrible, the story is stupid (albeit very loosely connected to the original), but its fun. Lots of neat woods scenes, fun characters (despite bad acting and bad scripting), etc. The more I write, the more I wonder why I rated this so high."
4,spoiler review,"I am wiccan, I saw the first movie and wasn't too upset because they didn't actually SHOW a witch hurting anyone. This movie has an actual witch, as ddefined in our times. The chericter of Erica is one that i liked because they didn't try to sugar coat her like in ""Simply Irresistable."" And even though it all ended in the realization that there had been a huge demonic sex orgy, I knew it wouldn't make people go onw modern day witch hunt, so i loved the movie."
1,"why a sequel, it just shows how dumb people go to get so far","seriously, why a frickin sequel. the original had taste and it was more better than this one. I mean come on people. you have a group of people going to the place where the movie was made and they set a tour and everything happens. a stupendous garble of a beginning and a total shame of a waste. no chills."
4,Typical TR game,"A good game over all, but I had unusual trouble with getting Lara to swing on a rope. I ended up bypassing a section of one level because I could not get past the rope section, even after going to an earlier place and practicing. At least in this version you can get around problems. Not the case with xbox versions of later games."
1,:(,Doesn't work with Vista. I even tried to use the option to use and older version of windows and it does not work.
2,Bad ending,"This game is not bad for an older game. Not as good as other TR games. The biggest problem is that on the last level, there is a bug that makes it almost impossible to finish the game. Well I suppose I got 90% of the game...What's going on with Aspyr!?!?"
4,Papa Roach DVD is the best DVD..,well i really really liked this DVD...i recommend it to the mad fans...the concert was really good...but the bad thing is about this DVD is the videos are censored and not uncut..but the concert was still good...if you see the back is says ''Easter Egg''..to access the ''Easter Egg'' pop it into your computer...go to Scene Selection and click End Credit...when the credits are rolling press T and choose Title 23 and its footage of Papa Roach on the tour bus...i thought it was funny...but anyway overall i give this DVD 4 Stars cause the concert was awesome but the videos was a dissappointment...but i hope you found this review helpful.
1,Not so great,"If you need a $1 filler, don't get this. I looks like it was printed 20 years ago. It is small, 4 x 5 inches with 4 pages."
4,banjo capo,"quick to put on and take off. a must have for churches, or for playing for different singers. highly recommend this capo"
5,"Heavy Duty Rock "" Gravel No Stone Unturned "" Cool","I will be brief ...I love rock I love garage and the power trio format. My favorite bands are Cactus,Black Sabbath,Hendrix,Hawkwind etc. It is very nice to stumble upon this fine band!I was looking for the Gravel collection Garage Rock from the mid-sixties and landed on this Gravel instead and glad I did!Highly charged rock with great guitar and guitar tone loud and hard and a huge sound..The problem is it is long out of print and is getting up there in pricing I would check it out a pick the cd !The Band created 2 cds the first is "" Gravel "" the second "" No Stone Unturned "" get both but for sure get this "" No Stone Unturned "" It's a fine piece of rock and you will Not be disappointed ....It is that good!"
5,Funny well-written book!,"This early chapter book was just right for my daughter (8 yrs). I read it after she did, because she told me it was great and I wanted see what kind of books she liked. It was cute. I especially enjoyed the kid giving himself a ""cootie shot"" and Ivy's creative book report ideas. The kids' relationships and the school stuff was funny and realistic. My daughter and I recommend this book."
1,This is not a movie,We were disappointed. This is not a movie based on Primo Levi's book. It's a collection of interviews. Not interesting.
5,MUST HAVE!!!!,"This is a must have if you own a mini. Before, as I open the glove box, things would just fall out. So I don't put many things in there.Now, everything is organized and does NOT fall out as the glove box is opened. I actually have more room to store my other junk. Lots more actually! I've run out of ideas as to what I would store in it.The picture provided by the vendor is very accurate. Construction is velvet all around and extremely close to matching the dark grey interior. It provides an additional layer of storage and for fits the glove box door to prevent things from moving from one shelf to the bottom. the fit is snugged and exact so there's no need to worry about it vibrating (at least I haven't noticed it yet in the houston bumpy roadds)."
5,Best organizer.,"This is one of the best organizers I've purchased. Felt blends right in and there's no need for clamps and screws. If you have been thinking about purchasing, get it. My only qualm was that there was no packaging. Item just arrived in the box."
4,Satisfying....,"Puzzle Challenge literally have hundreds of different types of puzzles. I purchased this game to assist me in passing time in a somewhat constructive manner while traveling. It passed the test with flying colors! If you are into puzzles, you will enjoy this game."
4,Single Item Stops?,"It first when I saw the title ""Shoplifters vs. Retailers: The Rights of Both"" all I could think of was the only rights shoplifters should have is to be ""hooked and booked"". However, after reading the book I would say the book should be required reading for begining Loss Prevention Agents. I like the Scenario and Analysis set up of the book. But there are far too many ""single item"" detentions in the book. For me to risk my badge, possibly my job, and a lawsuit on a bad detention if I am wrong on a single item, I have to be VERY certain that a shoplift has occurred and that the individual has the merchandise. Not that I have not been involved in single item detentions, but sometimes it's better to let someone walk with the merchandise; because if the person is a true shoplifter they will be back."
4,Le Carre is the man.,"This is the best spy novel - and one the best books - I have ever read. Le Carre gives a very real look at the world of espionage during the Cold War. A real novel of suspense, deceit, and intrigue. He holds you on the edge of your seat as Leamas tries, for one last time, to ""come in from the cold"". If you're looking for a fast-paced book, don't look here. You won't find it. And if you can't handle hard-to-follow plots, you won't like this one much either. Reading this novel makes me want to read even more of Le Carre. A must for a ""real"" spy enthusiast."
5,One Of The Best Books I have Ever Read.,"John LeCarre is one of the few authors ever that has been capable of writing a book that is both a suspenseful, thrilling page-turner, and at the same time satisfying literature with interesting and believable characters.This book is fascinating, fun, and satisfying. Like all of LeCarre's books, you will NEVER see the plot twist coming.Do yourself a favor, read this book."
4,Quick and Bleak,"Considered the best spy novel ever written, this is a quick, bleak book. It is widely praised for its realistic portrayal of Cold War spycraft, and rightfully so. There's hardly any 007-style action, no gizmos, no babes, just an elaborate, nasty plot. More or less makes all other Cold War spy novels redundant in its efficient depicted of an old British spy making his last big gambit before being retired. Tight prose and lots of tension."
4,Cold War classic,"I remember the opening scene of the movie of this book from my high school days but I didn't remember any of the story. Le Carre isn't always easy to follow, but I found this novel intriguing and quite interesting despite the dated setting. Guess living through the Cold War helped. It's a quick read and fun to try to figure out what's truth."
5,Classic. Of course.,"If you read spy fiction your really should read at least of few of le Carre's books. There's a quiet brooding style he has that really puts him in the literature class, as opposed to the Bond stuff. Also, le Carre really knows his stuff. Excellent novel."
3,Confusing Plot,The story of 2 intelligent agencies trying to confuse each other ended up confusing me. Maybe I am not just up to the intrique and counter intrique but I prefer a more straight forward plot. The ending was unsatisfactory and all in all I did not like the book
5,Suspenseful and exciting!,"I seem to remember a movie of this title, but couldn't quite remember how it unfolded. Anyway, the book was gripping and I quickly put any thoughts about the movie behind me. The ending had a great twist and left me kinda exhausted."
5,I wish I could write like John le Carre,"I found myself rereading pages just amazed at his spare and direct prose.The story is frustrating and sad. It shows how the use of double agents compromises everyone. It reveals the spy trade deployed to protect us as devious and amoral capable of destroying honest, passionate and well meaning citizens in its effort to protect its agents.The cold war is long over and the Berlin wall is gone. For those of us who came of age in those years, especially those with relatives behind the Iron Curtain the book feels like an icy hand around your heart.A brilliant and chilling book."
5,Spycraft,"Many years ago, I saw the film version of this book, starring Richard Burton. It was fascinating. At the time, I didn't pay attention to the author but ran into his name often in recent years due to my new love of mysteries and espionage fiction. This is not an action driven book, although things do happen. There's little emphasis on ""blood and guts"" that we encounter contstanly today. What there is is strong characterizations, thoughtful description and exposition, and strong procedurals. This is a Cold War book, Connelly's first, I believe, however, even with the razing of ""the Wall"" and the breakup of the Soviet Union, I found this book a vivid 'rememberance of things past' as well as a mirror to events today."
3,"It was ok, but seemed to forced.","Over all I would have to say this book was ""alright"" at it's best. I'm not a big fan of spy books but if I have to drudge my way through one, this one would be it. It's pretty fast passed and easy reading. It keeps you confussed engough that you want to keep on reading. What I didn't like was that it seemed to forced. The charaters, the side love plot, a lot of the feelings and emotions expressed through the book, just didn't seem like they had to be there. It seemed like LeCarre just thought ""it's a spy book, so I HAVE TO have this in it..."". It would have been better if LeCarre had completely broken away from the stereotypical spy book as it seemed he was trying so hard to do."
3,Well-known writer,"I purchased this book for a read and discussion with my book club. Unfortunately, I never got a chance to read it. The book discussion was good and the club found his writing well-done but the plot was quite confusing. I don't plan to read it.Sandi70"
4,What kind of life must this be?,"Dear ReadersI read this book....many years after actually becomming a spy.Perhaps I should have read it before becoming one.Perhaps you would like to know my mission. What my mission was, that is.Perhaps you might think I work for the CIA.When I get more time I'll tell you.Right now I'm in a bit of a rush. Sorry.I suppose we're all spies in some way.....well that's not quite true but well philosophy writers might tell you that we're all philosophers in some way.This book will give you some notions of how just exactly people get used in the spying business not just by the enemy that's easy to deal with but it's always one's own people that are the most dangerous.Also the book will give you some notion of what it is to be a double agent.Best Regardssjwp.s. too bad Matt Damon can't do another Jason Bourne.maybe he can do some John LeCarre"
1,The spy who came in from the cold,worst condition book I have ever seen. Pages fell out as I readwas lucky to finish. Book is in trashwould never buy from him again.
2,Top 100 novels? Seriously?,"I read one novel by John Le Carre before: Our Kind of Traitor, which was terribly disappointing. Th Spy, on the other hand, has been included in the list of top 100 novels of the century by Time. I picked it up.The beginning of the novel is gripping, the plot develops unpredictably. However, from the middle of the book it just deteriorates into cliches, ""good British spies against bad communists"". I wish the author spent time studying East German justice system, to at least get the terminology right. It's a spoiler, but at the end of the novel the German intelloigence officer walks into a prison full of political detainees, opens the door with his own keys and lets the character - detained by the communist state - out into the street, where another escapee is waiting for her...Thhis novel is good to read in the dentist's waiting room. Top 100? No way."
1,Absolutely Awful!,"This has to be one of the most overrated books of all tme. This book is the ultimate definition of ""Blah"", absolutely boring beyond belief. You will receive more joy from watching paint dry. I wanted to give it a zero stars rating, however, the system would not allow it."
1,This book is just plain boring,I don't even know why I bought this! It focusses only on people's expressions and feelings rather than a proper plot line. Waste of time to read :(
4,The Spy Who Came in from th Cold,"I just finished reading the original hardback, my copy has a copyright date of 1963. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. There are alot of ups and downs and you really never know what is going to happen until the very end. Reading a book this old makes you wonder why writers don't write this way anymore. They probably should. I recommend this book to anyone, especially if you can get your hands on an old copy like mine.Peter Moore - Author of Copyright and Skip-Trace"
3,Audiobook: Dramatization for Radio with Multiple Actors' Voices,"The audiobook, which I purchased, uses the old school craft of radio drama combined with a master spy story. All characters have unique voices with realistic personalities. There are sound effects such as bottles and glasses, doors, cars, the beach and sirens.I don't recommend the audiobook because it the acting wasn't performed nearly as well as the movie, and the print version is also better.The story doesn't glorify anything although it probably is a draw for Cold War history buffs. Those ""in the game"" are in it for the game, not ideals. At their professional level, this would make sense. There's really not much glamour depicted about the personal lives of spies.I can see why this story became a popular traditional spy story. The plot moves very quickly, the characters take the spotlight but only long enough to carry a scene here and there. I never guessed what was going to happen next. The ending was abrupt yet meaningful."
4,good quick read,"the book was fantastic from start to finish. the story moves very quickly and isn't overly long. if you like other books like Our Man in Havana by Graham Greene, I would highly recommend this book."
4,The Book that Made Le Carre Famous,"This is the one that made LeCarre's name. It is a dark look at the horrible machinations of the KGB and MI6 at the height of the cold war, and the price that a number of foot soldiers in that war paid. This book sets the form that LeCarre will work to perfection until the collapse of the Soviet Union - damaged British agents versus evil communists with a fair amount of innocents on both sides getting taken down in the whole mess. It's a great read, you should check it out."
5,John le Carre's Spy novel,"John Lecarré describes a world that seems altogther different from our own, but yet it feels very real. His world is one without mercy or forgiveness. The book is chilling at times, but the films based on his books are not nearly as terrifying."
5,Stunning work of art,"Meet Alec Leamas, aged British spy who lives for revenge. For him, it's a clear thing - he wants to whack East German agent Mundt who destroyed his career even if that means he will end up six feet under ground too. Leamas is man-gotta-do school, and he doesn't realize that he is just a pawn in a chess game that hasn't nothing to do with killing Mundt.Masterpiece of characterization and suspense, this book has my deepest recomandation."
3,"In 1987 it was considered as a ""must have""","This book looks old fashioned, to-day. Even if pictures and Laura Ashley own house are great, the pedagogical approach looks a bit ""outdated""."
1,Not Happy,"So it was an amazing television for my bedroom at first; although, I agree the sound design and the speaker system was not top quality. First I'd like to say that the picture was amazing and I had never been happier with a TV.....until the picture decided to drop to a low dark tint uncontrolably. There's nothing I can do to rectify this problem and it will not go away. Stupid me, didn't buy the warranty from the store; if you insist on buying theis television, BUY THE WARRANTY!"
3,Could have been great,"I agree with many here that the set has a major flaw...the audio output is insufficient. It's odd because other aspects of the set are well engineered, and yet they seem to have forgotten hearability. Frankly, to do it over, I wouldn't buy this set."
3,"Great TV, but minor costs minor headaches","I bought this TV 5 years ago for around $700. It is a great TV, until recently. I haven't had any problems with the audio. The picture quality was crystal clear, even at 15 feet away where I normally view it. The DVD player is really frustrating and I would suggest staying away from TV/DVD combos period. The DVD will freeze or skip in the middle of the movie. This TV recently had a bad main board in it, which from reviews on the internet I find is normal for this TV. TV Repair est. was around $310. I will do it myself for $70, but the repair man told me to always stay away from LCDTV/DVD players because he always gets calls on them freezing or going bad. He told me to save some money and replace the main board on my own and he showed me how to do it. So this is a great TV, but you may have to do a little maintenance to it occasionally. Another downside, there is only 1 HDMI port. So you have to choose which device you want HDMI?? Blue ray or cable box?"
2,Lacks Audio Output or Headphone Jack,"Several people have pointed out that the built in sound on this TV isn't great. One person pointed out that you can hook it up to an external sound system.Not actually. This TV lacks the standard Audio Out jacks. There is no RCA audio outjack. Not even a headset jack.This TV does have a digital audio out jack - so you could use it with a modern surround sound system. Unfortunately, that's not what we have. People who want to hook up a simple headphone, or a wireless headphones, or regular stereo speakers are out of luck.We have called Sharp product support and verified that this is true. They provide no workaround or explanation for this omission.This is a show-stopper for us. My wife likes to watch TV over her wireless headphones while I fall asleep. A TV without audio jacks is out of the question."
2,Major defect on this model,"After six months of ownership, this TV began turning itself on randomly. The main circuit board was replaced. The TV still turns itself on. (However, the sound is now improved significantly!) We expect to have the TV replaced. No one seems to know why it turns itself on. The circuit board took four months to be delivered after the initial complaint. We were told the part was backordered. Maybe our complaint is a common one?"
3,"In all fairness, I plan on reading it again.","This is the first book I have read where I think my age impacts my ability to appreciate it's depth. I read it when I was 23 and immediately could not relate to the main character at all, on any level. Being a huge fan of Hemingway's writing otherwise, this will be a book I look forward to coming back to in twenty years or so. I'm glad for that, because somedays I worry that I'll read all his books too fast and be left with nothing of his to read for the rest of my life."
3,"yes, it is the worst","To Have and Have Not is a character study of a failure - Harry Morgan. He is a poor man in Key West and Cuba who cannot figure out how to make a living, so he turns to murder, thievery and smuggling. While most see Morgan as an essentially good man forced into evil, from the first segment he makes stupid decisions, and never shows much goodness. Bigoted and mean, he is the least sympathetic character in the collected works. But that's not why the book is bad - It is disjointed - with several points of view, all caring about different things. The book only moves when Morgan is having adventures. The rest is empty. From a big Hemingway fan, I voice disappointment."
2,TOO MANY AT SLOPPY JOE'S?,"This is nowhere as good as Islands in the Stream. The story is in the first 123 pages. Racist labelings apart, the prose is quite gripping up to that point. Then the protagonist Cap'n Harry Morgan gets forgotten and some drunk and not very interesting characters squabble in the bar and in the bedroom, who really have very little to do with the plot, except to justify the title (these are the Have's). Harry Morgan is basically a good, hard-livin' guy who likes to drink and fish (like Hemingway), but it's as though the author ran out of steam with him. A deeper plot, with less time gaps and jumping about between characters might have made this a much better novel, but you'll find trademark H. understatement and great descriptions of the sea, especially of a marlin jumping out of the water."
3,worth reading,"The critics happen to be right this time. The characters are not believable and whats worse none of them are likeable. If you're a big hemingway fan it's worth reading. Just don't start off with it. I recomend ""The sun also rises""."
2,Not one of Hemingway's best,"This book reminded me of a horrid ride that you couldn't get off. At first it was fun, then gradually, you just want to puke. It's the story of a weak protagonist who spends the book carrying out a pathetic vendetta against authority in general. I was extremely disappointed with this novel since I usually love Hemingway's work. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless you want to read about the same recurring incident over and over."
2,Not one of his better novels,This is definitely not one of Hemingway's better novels. It just dragged on & on.
1,JUNK!!!,"What a dog! It's dull, nothing happens. There's no plot, no character. Watch the Bogart film--it's got nothing to do with the book, that's why the movie is so good"
4,Classic Hemingway,"I had read the first section of a three part story years ago in an anthology of Hemingway novels and short stories. The second and third parts are also centred on Harry Morgan, the luckless charter boat operator in the Florida Keys.It's a pretty gritty story, set in a time when America was mired in the Great Depression. Harry's hard-scrabble existence goes from bad to worse through the three episodes but through it all his wife remains steadfast by his side. Nothing sugar-coated in this tale and the writing is classic Hemingway."
4,Rather have read the book than have not,Hemmingway writes in a way that makes for a page turner. There is an undercurrent throughout the story of the trials faced by people of all classes; rich and poor. Life is seen as a struggle to acquire money or about worrying about money with an occassional respite for short term pleasures.
3,Hard Cuban style,"Following a trip to Havana in which I took in the villa and hotel rooms where Hemingway spent much of his time, I wanted to try this lesser known novel of his which begins with a typically terse but magnificent Hemingway description of tough guys in early morning Havana, operating before the ice wagons come to service the bars.This novel is a mixed bag. The dialogue is excellent, and the scenes where Harry and his wife's marital tension is explored are first rate and represent some of Hemingway's finest writing.The rest of the time it is largely a tale of hard men becoming undone. Which is a theme dealt with better in some of Hemingway's other writings anyway."
4,To have and have not,"Thanks you very much for your work. It was fast, good and on time. We did nor expect such a quick shipment."
1,To have and have not,This is one of the worst books I have ever read. He must have been drunk when he wrote it. I find it very choppy and inane. The characters and plots are started and never developed. Incidents begin in the middle of an event and end abruptly. I gave it one star only because I couldn't go lower. A total waste of money.
2,"It was intresting, but hard to follow","I found this book extremely confusing to follow the main character is Harry Morgan but I could never tell who the ""I"" was in the following chapter. I picked this book to do for a book report and it was very hard to express the main point and to summarize it."
2,Don't choose this for any essays in school,There is not enough information on this story. I picked this book for a criticism paper in english and could not find anything about the various themes or elements of this story. Pick The Sun Also Rises. This is not a popular story as far as analizing goes. A for effort.
3,"Good story, not academic","Bass is a good storyteller; unfortunatley he is not as good of a researcher. Overall this book is an easily readable retelling of the life and Revolutionary War campaigns of Francis Marion. There's nothing new or particularly insightful here, and unfortunatley Bass gets several military details wrong (such as the numeric designations of British regiments) and provides a one dimensional portrait of Tarleton and other British leaders."
4,Bass seems to give history with some embellishments,"Bass fills in some gaps in Marion's campaigns, but adds what seem to be little embellishments here and there to make for better reading. Basically, this is a good book that gave me some information, not found elsewhere, for writing my book, Parker's Guide to the Revolutionary War in South Carolina."
4,Great read about the legendary Swamp Fox.,"I chose this for a book review in a college course. Interesting read about a moody but brilliant tactician, the father of guerrilla war. If you have any interest in the American Revolution give this book a read, I believe you will enjoy it."
2,Overly dense,"Bass' book is stuffed to the gills with details about battles and personalities surrounding the campaigns of Francis Marion, but, as a newcomer to the subject, I found that to be more problematic than helpful. If one does not already possess a working knowledge of the subject, the amount of detail and Bass' constant jumping from event to event is somewhat overwhelming. I also found that the lack of a consistent narrative gave the book a text-book quality."
4,For the glory of Rome,"This book describes how Rome was being governed as a Republic and gets into detail about the wars they fought. Even for Machiavelli these writings we distant history and what really surprised me was the way this book has been written and translated.Being an admirer of Rome and its golden age this book really gave me new insights, despite reading a lot of other books about this subject. As in Machiavelli's most famous book 'The Prince' politics are again the major subject. It is really astonishing to see the details and consequences of the actions that are being taken.If you would like to know more about Rome, history or politics, grab a copy of this book."
5,Excellent buy,"No regrets, I'm going to buy more of these if they are going to be available. Best value for money and everything I could ask for. This switch made my network so much better."
5,Cooking without Fat,This is a wonderful book. I have tried some of the recipes and they are very tasty. Looking forward to trying more.
2,quality reflected in price,i was excited to get 300 tc sheets for such a good deal... when i received them i realized why they were so cheap... it's because of the 40% polyester. they do not feel like 300tc cotton sheets AT ALL... i got 360tc cotton sheets from amazon for just a few dollars more and those are well worth it. these i would pass on.
3,sheet,This certain sheet isn't as soft as I'd that it would be; It's a little more slick then I'd like it.
5,So soft,"These sheets are wonderful. They are so soft!! Be careful when you wash them, though. I got the burgundy and have washed them twice and they are still bleeding onto other things."
2,"Didn't fit, low quality","Most of the time I get a good deal shopping for bargains on Amazon, but this wasn't one of those times. The sheets were mediocre quality. That would've been fine had they fit properly, but they were exceptionally baggy and the elastic was weak. Waste of my money."
3,Does not fit an extra long mattress,"Certain sheets can fit both regular and xl due to their elasticity, but these won't fit my tempurpedic twin xl.A bit tight."
1,Cheap price but exceptionally poor quality,"If you just want rather low-end sheets, then you might as well buy them for a similar price from a local discounter such as Walmart etc. The reason many of us buy sheets from Amazon is to get a high-end product at a reasonable/attractive price. If that describes you, these sheets are NOT for you. With all that polyester thrown in, these sheets are really no different from cheap 200TC sheets you might have seen at your local discounter. If you do still order these, rest assured that you are ordering from a store with one of the best customer service around."
5,Super soft & comfy!,"I purchased these sheets in almost all of the available colors because of the fantastic price. I received them in a timely manner by the super saver shipping, which made this an even better deal! The sheets washed very well & are soft & luxurious. The deep pockets keep them from slipping off the mattress, which is wonderful. All in all, these are great sheets at a great price, highly recommended!"
4,"Sheets, very good","The sheets are soft. Very big too... a bit big for my Reg. King size bed. I suppose it is good so it won't be too tight where it would keep on coming off the mattress?? Though, a bid too big where too much slacks.... Good is... it is very confortable & soft :) Was a good deal when I purchased it!"
2,bit irritating,"So basically Andre decides to seek revenge against Kathy for a slight he believes she did. Saw that one a mile away when some background was given in the beginning, but of course it isn't revealed until later in the story about what he is up too. When she finds out she gets mad. She is stuck with him for three weeks on a little vacation. A man she basically just met. She introduced him to her roommates/friends too. Well after the farce is revealed it just so happens that her friend comes dropping by and Kathy was going to leave with the friend instead of staying. The friend Libby had come by to try to hook up with Andre even though she knew Kathy was with him. Weird!! Of course then Kathy has to stay and comfort Andre because even though he just ripped her heart out and handed it to her she feels bad for him. Some heroines are really just TSTL! Then there are the normal misunderstanding, unplanned pregnancies and running away stuff that is typical of these books."
5,.,"I used to own a copy of this, but it got lost along the way. The only poem from it that I remember by name is ""Nellie Meyers,"" which stays with me years later, though I don't know why. I think because it and other parts of the book are nearly completely unguarded, in an innocent way. Perhaps it is on the other end of the spectrum from Glare."
3,Good songs but mediocre sound quality,"Great songs, but the sound quality on the Island remastered version (which I just received from Amazon) is sort of blah."
5,A must read for every science teacher!,"The book was amazing, not only because it was easy-to-read, but also because the suggestions within the book were helpful when I was dealing with elementary students who needed extra help. I loved it!"
1,"Quality control shaky, may cause a big problem.","One of these G&C; cartridges (yellow) had a leak which allowed air to enter the print head of my MP780 Canon multipurpose printer (http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PIXMA-MP780-Photo-Printer/dp/B00030CHOE). Fortunately for me I was able to remove and clean the head but at the cost of much additional ink and considerable time. Someone unable to handle this somewhat complex task would have to have the printer repaired or replace it altogether.I still use these cartridges, but I inspect them carefully.The last order received from Abacus was shipped USPS, took four days (including the weekend) to arrive. There was no tracking and I discovered the package laying on my front porch and wide open. Kudos to the USPS, all items shipped were in the bag."
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"MatchBox 20 is a fantastic musical group. I especially love their song ""The Real World""BUT I LOVE COUNTRY"
4,A Night In Tunisia,"This is a very fine recording. I would say early Sixties.The big band consists of a French Horn section as opposed to a Sax section. Dizzy's small group including Leo Wright & Lalo Schifrin is the main unit using the Big Band as a accompanist(if I can put it that way) ""Night in Tunisia"" is excellent!The rest of the tunes are great.""This Is The Way"" features Leo Wright. I would say if you like Dizzy, check it out, especially at this price! Another CD with approximately the same personnel is ""Gillespiana.This CD has two albums in one. They are ""Gillespiana & ""The 1961 Carnegie Hall Concert""This is a Great CD.... (VLS)"
2,Not a total loss,"Wayne Shorter, like a lot of great talents, seeks their own voice. All the great ones have done that, this is simply one that reaches out for something new. This DVD has great video, great sound, here is the but, all this faux piano and bass give the music a synthesized sound. The free jazz movement has no continuity, no form. If you enjoy that, this is for you. However, the last two concerts are a save. The 91 concert brings the accoustical back. the second has Herbie Hancock playing some guitar like electronic thingy that sounds electronic. Again, if this is your bag, great!. The last two tracks from 92 bring Ron Carter on bass, Tony Williams on drums, and a great trumpeter, (no name on box), with Herbie on, a real piano. These last two are great for those of us that like that straight ahead sound, but still avant garde. Not a terrible DVD, just not one that I will reach for very much."
5,an innovator,"Too much of what you hear in New York these days is merely a rehash of old styles. Where is the innovation that Jazz is supposed to feed upon?Fortunately we have Greg Osby. Osby is one of a few true innovators on the NY scene. The first time I heard ""Concepticus in C"" (the last piece in this CD), it was like a punch in the face, almost as hard as the first time I heard Coltrane's Giant Steps. I listened to this short piece ten times in a row just to figure out its structure: it breaks all the rules. Osby's idea of rythm and harmony is really something else, very unusual, yet highly structured.I heard Osby in clubs in New York a few times, and walked out amazed every time. I highly recommend this CD."
4,Japanese top fightr aircraft in WW II,"Gives an excellent protrayal of the development and use as an top notch attack fighter, the best in the World at the start of WW II: and took the US close to a year to develop anything that could match it."
1,Huh?,"Too abstract, foolishly dodges the multitude of ground-level problems the Bible presents to a modern reader, and appears to blame modernism for the ground-level problems, which is pure apologetics, and pretty lame at that. Skip it."
4,Sweet,"I liked the price tag on this item, and all in all am satisfied with it. I do, however, wish it had overdrive. Other than than everything was good."
2,Loud Amp but.....,"Damaged in transit, might have been a faulty amp originally. Oh well, have to have it replaced. LOUD AS HELL WHEN IT IS WORKING THOUGH! Great Value."
5,Adventures of Sherlock II,"The Game's afoot again as David Timson narrates the second volume of The Adventures. He reads with verve, alacrity, joy and understanding. His vocal character stylizations are a delight for both the uninitiated in the genre and the seasoned Sherlockian campaigner."
5,Undiscovered Spanish treasure,"This is a little Spanish export, and it's right up there with 'For Lovers Only'. Cheesey, sleazy, packed with Mexican wrestlers, super-heroes, pointy boots, snack crackers, 'special outfits', Mayan vampire women, camels and hot licks."
5,calexico on crank,"I do believe they've created a new genre, psycho-border-billy .... must have more. Where's the sequel?"
4,Great Surf CD!,One of the best SCOTS cd's if like surf music! Glad I bought it! The instrumental tracks are just awesome!
1,The Work of Five Authors,"I cannot believe that it took five people to write this useless book. There is not one novel idea throughout the entire book. By novel I mean creative, imaginative, or anything that I have not already considered myself. This was a waste of time and money. The only gift idea that I gained was the notion that this would be a perfect gift for someone that I truly despised."
1,A Terrible Book,"What a waste of time. This book is so boring and monotonous. If I read one more time, how Jerry Frey used his ""20 years of experience to make the decision"" - I will hurl. Where is the insight? Where is the original thinking? How about some depth? Please save your money."
2,A library book at best...,"I found this book in an airport bookstore and hoped it would make for an entertaining flight home... bad move. This book has all the elements for a truly fun read but as previous reviewers have stated is simply lacking in the execution. As a market watcher for 15 years I assumed that following a fund manager around during one of the most fascinating years in market history would translate well. But the book gives virtually no information about how industry professionals viewed these events, or even a nugget or two of new information or perception. Instead we hear streams of one-sided phone conversations and crib notes of market banter that are unintelligible even if you fully understand the jargon. If you are looking for an entertaining book about the stock market, look elsewhere. If you are considering a career in money management and want to understand the day to day drudgery, this may be useful."
1,Typical banausic tripe,"...I have to admit that I was quite disappointed. This book issuch a banausic tripe that I couldn't even finish it. If yourbackground is not in finance or if you have no clue as to what Portfolio Managers do, you will find this book somewhat interesting, but if you are like me, and you know a little bit about the stock market, you'll be truly disappointed. The story doesn't have a high, it doesn't get to a climax whatsoever. The story goes on to describe the daily life of an unknown Portfolio Manager. And it does just that. Each chapter starts with ""It's monday....."". As for style is concerned, I'm just coming off reading ""The Tortilla Curtain"" from Tom Boyle and let me tell you, Molly Baker is no match. The words are uninspired, boring just like the story. It seems that Molly Baker has a technical writing background and it shows in the book. Nice try though!"
1,"boring, banal, popcorn","This is one of those books that when you have read it you are asking yourself, ""why did they bother""? There is a hundred times more nitty-gritty about how funds are really managed in Victor Niederhoffer's book or Schwartz' Pit Bull. Maybe this was a paid promo piece? But it's all hollow, empty calories."
2,you get what you pay for,"Upon using it the very first time, the plastic lever that works the suction cup broke. This made it quite challenging to turn the crank and hold it still at the same time."
2,"ill-fitting, puny appliance",Disappointed with this rather frail machine. It can't handle apples unless they are cooked to mush. The teflon washer bearing keeps getting entrained with the product.
3,"For tomato sauce, it could be better.","We purchased this with the optional motor assembly so we wouldn't have to crank through 6 bushels. We also got the separate attachment kit that had 3 different sized screens. We felt the screen that came with the strainer was too small for the consistency we wanted. There was so much waste that we would have put it through ten times before getting it all. If you're looking for juice, no problem, but we wanted a little pulp too since we were making sauce. We switched to the next size screen, ""Pumpkin"", but the holes were so big, the seeds came through. Even still, we put them through 3 times. We really needed a screen in between the two sizes to get the output we needed."
5,Roma Food Strainer and Sauce Miaker,"It's made my tomato canning so much easier, it separates the seeds, and skin from the tomato. I also use it for making baby food for my little one. I don't know how I ever got along without it. I highly recommend this product."
5,Roma Juice Processor,We had a similar unit that was around 20 years old. Every time we used it would leak all over the kitchen floor making it a real pain to clean up afterwards. This New model is leak proof and is a real joy to use. It is very easy to setup and very easy to clean. The juice goes where it should and the compressed leftovers go thru a long tube away from the pount of operation so processing is easy. This product makes canning a job we look forward to doing in the fall. Highly recommended!!!
5,so far so good,This product looks great. we unpacked it and everything seems in order. I did not use it yet though. I would recommend this to all my friends who do home canning.
5,good helper.,"We used this to seed tomatoes and berries, with the accessory kit, and it did a good job. When you buy, also get the kit as it makes it more useful, and the tomato screw, that's the one we used the most.."
5,Great strainer,"After years of using aunt's my aunts ancient strainer to make Tomato sauce and soups I finally bought my own. The Roma works like a champ, sturdy construction, and the plastic didn't stain even though I was processing Tomatoes for 6 hours.two thumbs up!"
3,the jury's still out,"I bought this primarily to juice pomegranates, but it didn't work well for that. The first batch of seeds went OK, but the next time I tried it, it just froze up and I couldn't even turn the handle - maybe the seeds are too big. Anyway, I will try it next summer with my tomatoes."
4,GOOD JOB SO FAR,"I RECEIVED MY ROMA FOOD MILL JUST AS WE WERE READY TO PICK OUR GRAPES, I ALSO BOUGHT THE 4 PIECE ASSC. KIT SO THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO DO ALL KINDS OF FRUIT, AND VEGGIES.SO FAR IT HAS SAVE ME A LOT OF TIME, AND WORKS PRETTY WELL. I ALSO TRIED IT ON PERSIMMONS AND THE SEEDS ARE JUST TOO BIG, MADE A MESS.LOOKING FORWARD TO APPLE SEASON, WILL TRY MY HAND AT MAKING APPLESAUCE WITH IT.I WOULD SAY IT WAS A GOOD INVESTMENT, SAVES YOU TIME IN THE KITCHEN."
4,roma food strainer,does great job with tomatoes. have not tried other screens that were purchased.only fault is suction base does not make a solid seal. would have rated 5 stars but for suction base.clamp does the job of holding strainer.
3,Could have been better,"I was very excited to receive this Strainer as we had a lot of grapes to peel, seed and strain for jelly. The huge hopper is a bonus because you don't have to stop and load it frequently, and the crank is fairly easy to turn. Those parts worked great, but the problem is with the suction cup. It held for the first 30-45 minutes or so, then would not stick. Our counters and table are too thick to clamp so the faulty suction cup was a big deal for us. Clean up was no problem because everything dismantles easily and cleans almost effortlessly with soap & water. We put all except the metal base in the dishwasher. Clean as slick as a whistle!"
4,Good gadget,Made the process of canning tomatoes so much faster! The plastic parts don't feel sturdy enough but did the job. Guess that is a good trade off to keep the price reasonable. Worthwhile!
3,disappointed,"this product does crush the tomatos but the handle leaks and the handle moves in and out - very messy, disappointed with quality"
5,Great DVD!,Love this dvd but of course I fancy Robbie Williams. This is a good place to start if you don't know who he is.
5,All Robbie!,GREAT DVD! It's shows you Rob on vacation and up close and personal. A great way to get to know Rob! -All Rob's Page
5,Looks nice behind the stove,"Would recommend this product. It definately has enough coverage for the back of your stove. Although I did not need the whole vertical measurement, it was the best buy I could find, that was not like paper...this is heavy duty ....stainless steel...backsplash is nice"
5,Replacement backsplash,"Easily replaced old backsplash with this new one. The stainless steel finish meshed nicely with my appliances. It fit perfectly, and required nothing more than securing it in a couple of places. I really like it!"
4,im happy,"Not first quality but good value for the price. I'm happy with it, it looks fine between my stainless stove and stainless range hood."
4,Old school Groove Merchant Funk in disguise...,"These are cuts off Michael Longo's (2) albums on Groove Merchant in the mid 70's. Mike plays a very funky electric piano while the other players lay down a super-solid groove. Ron Carter on bass-enough said! You can buy the cd's that these tracks are off, they were reissued in japan on the p-vine label- pretty pricey import. The titles are ""Funkia"" & ""900 Shades of the Blues"". Just more funky-jazz for you to get down to. Dig it!!"
3,THINGS AIN'T WHAT THEY USED TO BE,"SINCE THESE RECORDINGS DATE BACK TO 1940 AND 1941 , I GUESS A PERSON SHOULD NOT EXPECT TOO MUCH FROM SUCH VINTAGE RECORDINGS.EVEN WITH SOME RECORDING STATIC , THE QUALITY OF THE MUSIC IS ACCEPTABLE. I AM JUST SPOILED WITH TODAY'S RECORDING TECHNOLOGY."
3,Learning When To Delegate Responsibility,"This is a perfect book for those aspiring entrepreneuers on lessons of both starting a company and managing one. Never letting down his guard and sticking by his own way of doing things, Peterson's pivotal point to leave the company came in the midst of too much control for one person to handle. Peterson though was able to handle the decisions for many years to his credit and definately seemed the driving force in providing overall profitability in the company."
2,Horrible end to such a light series.,"""Broadway Bound"" marks the end of Simon's trilogy, and it's very dark and sad - not how I had hoped the trilogy would end. I found the characters different, but of course, you can say they matured, but Stanley was much more frantic than I remembered him to be. Eugene was much more level headed - not the sex-crazed teenage boy we knew and loved. Blanche lost her quirkiness, and the outcome of Jack and Kate disappointed me. The addition of Ben was what saved the play; the way Eugene played off of him was like ""old times."" I didn't feel the Jerome's were the Jerome's anymore. I do not recommend."
5,Good part but missed on the part number,"Yes this is the correct part number for a Speed Sensor on a E series Ford van BUT seems there is a sub part number you need to be aware of as the holes for mounting it are different. Same basic part number but different sub part number.I gave it all 5 stars as it's hard to not like Motorcraft parts, and Amazon took the part back no questions - they have a great - the best - return system!!!"
4,Nice PoE injector switch,"I use this switch to mainly to inject power for a few Cisco 7960 (pre-standard) phones. The switch has a bunch of enterprise-like features, like VLAN support, fiber GBICs, console connection, etc.Be aware that this little switch has a fan, so it's noisy. If fits nicely in a rack with the included rackmounts, but isn't a switch you'd like to have on your desk."
2,Disappointed with this switch,"We placed this POE switch into service in June of 2010. It ran 24/7 and died on April 26, 2012. We didn't even get 2 years out of it. I don't think we will miss it though, because the fan was very loud. We bought a replacement for about half the price, and it features 8 gigabit ports instead of just 2 that came with the Linksys. To be fair, the Linksys had a couple of port connections that the new switch does not have, but we didn't use them anyway.Generally, we've had decent luck with Linksys stuff in the past, and I would buy Linksys products again. With only 2 gigabit ports, and a lifespan of less than 2 years, I think this particular switch is overpriced garbage."
5,Good news/bad news,"The good news is that the wonderful Central Park North album is, after a fashion, available again.The bad news is that the remastering is poor, and the odd, unnatural, abrupt canned applause is jarring and distracting. Who could have thought this would be an improvement? Unbelievable!This was always my favorite Thad/Mel album, full of performances worthy of detailed study and admiration. Try to ignore the problems, and enjoy the fantastic performances."
5,thad lones mel lewis,everything by thad and mel is great. am still looking for the album entitled thad jones mel lewis quartet with harold danko and rufus ried. hopefully someone can help me out.
3,Not outstanding,"This is basically a 75 page picture book with images that vary in size, quality and interest. Not outstanding, but contains a number of good pictures."
2,Uncomfortable,"I bought this air mattress for various usage. I liked the idea of a raised air mattress. Unfortunately there are two things that make this air mattress a bad one. The first is the built in ""pillow"". It's simply uncomfortable and unusable. Put your head on your pillow and look at the shape. It's like a valley between two hills. With this air mattress, the built in pillow is inflated to the max and is not soft but very firm. If you add your own pillow then your head is too high compared to the rest of the body. You'll wake up with neck pain.The second thing is that the rest of this air mattress is made of canals or straight ""tubes"". Remember that the mattress will be inflated until it's firm. If it's not firm then there is no support. I had to add a 2 inch memory foam topper to make it a little bit more comfortable but I can still feel the ""canals"". Definitely not something I will recommend to anyone."
1,Didn't work out for me,"Had this drive in service less than 1 yr as a slave drive for backup and transferring tapes to DVD, and, of course, it fails a couple of months out of warranty. Very glad I have backups of the drive as it's failing. Got multiple errors on the drive, formatted it, and still fails maxtor diagnostics. Am buying a WD drive to replace it. Glad this wasn't my boot drive."
3,Looks good but some loose threads,"This looks real good, feels reel good, but there are some loose threads that seem to me will lead to it self-destructing prematurely. More comfortable than some other brands though."
2,It seemed good.....,"This athletic supporter had a great fit. It offered very good support and was comfortable, as far as athletic supporters go. After two to three washes it just began to fall apart. I wouldn't recommend this product due to durability."
3,Performs well but frays easily from washing,I like this product but I'm a bit disappointed that it begins fraying after washing a few times. The best aspect is that the product comes in a variety of colors.
5,Outstanding,"Thank you for sending this product , they are just what the docotor order and they fit very comfortable"
1,False advertising,I received my supporters yesterday. To my surprise they were NOT the brand as advertised here. They came as the RAWLINGS brand instead. I was told it was an error and more or less told to just suck it up. Buyer beware here. Obviously I won't be doing business with this seller again.
1,Sized WRONG !,"I am a size 36 wasit so when I purchase underwear sized S M L, like Calvin Klein, I always get medium 34-36 that is not the case with this product. A medium with them is 32-34 the site did NOT give a size conversions so I ordered and recieved the wrong size. It's been useless, just laying an a dresser drawer never worn.. All sites should have a waist inch conversion to S M L for their products . I'd love for the product maker to contact me !"
4,Concise guide to practical orchestration,"Although I'm not sure that I would suggest this to someone who is an absolute beginner, this book has a lot of practical advise of what NOT to do, from someone who apparently made these mistakes himself at one time."
2,No Dope,"Disappointing album with lots of wack beats, wack samples and Peedo rapsKRS was probably forced to,or used a lot of some real bad shiiiit that he let them use his name for this album"
5,Excellent book on Bible prophecy,"This book is a detailed manual on current world events and Bible prophecy - a handbook on this topic. You will refer back to it many times. I have read it more than once.It gave me new insight into many Bible prophecies and about the amazing way that the Bible are being fulfilled in these days.The 'Last Fall of Babylon' is eye-opening in many ways. Hard facts are given throughout and you just cannot deny it (no wild speculations).Lastly, it strengthened my faith in a tremendous way to see how true the Word of God actually is."
1,Memories of Joy,"I remember this excellent little book. Someone gave it to me for my birthday, and I wish I'd been able to keep it. But 1973? I thought it was a year or so earlier.This slim volume seemed to me to be quite original. Hundreds, if not thousands, of books of that type have been written since then, and the ones I've seen haven't added much to what Schutz said.Funny, though. At the time, a friend's 13-year-old daughter told me that she'd lived next door to the author. She claimed he was a grouch."
5,Classic late-night comedy!,A no brainer in the best sense of the word. Imagine a very funny 'love boat' with a cast of beautiful 'California' girls. Late night cable isn't the same without Hot Springs Hotel.
1,Does not fit my '04 RX8,This item is not the right replacement item for the main belt on a 2004 Mazda RX8 as recommended by the part finder. It is too short and not wide enough. Don't buy this as a replacement belt for this car.
2,Mixed quality in this disc,"Delia Rigal was a singer of very varied quality. This recording covers a set of records made in Buenos Aires in the early 1950's and a number of tracs from concerts in the 1960's and early 1970's. the Argentine recordings are not very good but they do show her in good voice and interpretation. The later recordings show a worn, rather tired voice. If you buy this, concentrate on the Buenos Aires set, they show what Bing heard when he made her a Met mainstay."
2,duped,"Overpriced. All form and no function. The best example are the tongs. Completely worthless. Can't pick up anything. I bought on impulse based on the ealier reveiws. Obviously planted.Another downfall, the handles leak some type of grease."
3,Review,The tools in this set are great! Perfect weight. The only thing I did not like was that the case that it comes with. It was not made of metal all the way around and dented very easily.
4,Beware of duplicate tapes disguised with new covers...,"Although this workout is useful, I had already owned the exact same tape under the title, Fit and Fabulous At Any Age. When I saw the Anti-Aging Cardio workout video, I naturally assumed I had never seen it, thought it might be good and ordered it online. To my surprise, I opened the tape (which I was told once opened cannot be returned!) to find the same video under the Fit and Fabulous title. That the tape was duplicated under a different title was very misleading, and to be told that once opened, a tape cannot be returned, is deceiving, since I obviously had to open the tape to view it. I've heard this has happened before with workout tapes, and since I use workout tapes as the major part of my workouts, perhaps it should be noted that some tapes are copies under a new title/cover."
5,"Heart pumping, break out in sweat...fun!","I checked out this video at my local library just to try it...and I love it! Honestly, as a beginner I can't do all the moves right now. But the music is so upbeat and the moves fairly easy and fun that you just keep going. The toning and streching segments are great too. It gets my heart pumping and I know I'm boosting my metabolism."
3,Good for beginners,"This workout video was okay. I will continue to use it every once in a while for variety since I bought it. It can be fun and it does give you a workout, but I wouldn't say that I was worn out by the time the dancing was over. The toning and ab segments afterwards are much better than the cardio. I enjoy the music, but each song goes on too long by repeating the chorus line over and over, so that is a bit aggravating. But, if you don't mind that, the tape is pretty good."
3,Good for beginners...BUT,"I wouldn't recommend it for intermediate to advanced. I did it twice and got bored with the overall fitness level. It is a very fun video but just not enough ""OOMPH""! I did enjoy the stretching and ""plank"" position at the end of the tape though."
4,Pretty good workout for a 45 minute long video,"Energetic and bubbly, Denise Austin will definitely motivate you to get in shape in this video. It starts with a short warm up, then 20 minutes of aerobics divided into 3 segments. Only one of the aerobics sections is remotely challenging, but the 3 together will get you sweating. The toning focuses more on lower body--thighs, hips, and buttocks, but also includes abs--and it's followed by a decent cool-down. I'm not a baby-boomer, but I'm also not getting any younger and exercise really helps to keep you youthful. Although the music is a bit too dominating and the color scheme is gaudy 1960's, this video is a step in the right direction."
1,Denise is not my style...,This is a good cardio workout but by the third or fourth viewing the constant references to baby boomers and that era started to really get under the skin of this brat packer.
1,"I Don't Like ""Things""","I Like Things (Beginning-To-Read)It's too bad I can't give this book zero stars. ""I Like Things"" might be the worst book I've ever picked up.While the book may be about 300 words long, there are only 64 unique words used. I don't think Hillert ever uses an actual descriptive word - she just repeats ""things"" over and over.Here is some sample dialogue from pages 28-29, where the young boy is looking at his button, seashell and pine cone collections.pg. 28:I like things.Big things.Little things.pg 29:Red and yellow and blue things.What things do you like?I only recommend this book if you're trying to bore a young child to tears.Google Books has a limited preview available here: http://books.google.com/books?id=MC1wixMTBI4C&pg;=PA26&source;=gbs_selected_pages&cad;=3#v=onepage&q;&f;=false"
2,Leave it in the box,"The premise was promising. A man sent around the world in a box as punishment for messing with the wrong people. Unfortunately, once he's out of the box, not much happens, and the main character doesn't have much character. Struggled to finish, thinking there had to be a moral - couldn't find one."
5,Liked it,"It was a pretty good CD, some of the songs I didn't care for but some I loved so it kind of evened it out."
5,A Masterpiece,"This book clearly explains the basic guidelines to becoming a millionaire and taking time to enjoy the little things. Michael LeBoeuf is a great author and knows how to get to the point. The dedication and pride that went into this book is tremendous and it clearly beams whenever you read a passage from any part of the book. Always following LeBoeuf's Law: ""Invest your time actively and your assets passively."" I advise everyone to do themselves a favor and buy this wonderful masterpiece. It's truly made me a better person."
1,A joke,"Only a pompous windbag would name a ""law"" about investing after himself. Can you say shameless self promotion? Let Leboeuf make his next million on someonelse's back. Spend your money, instead, on ""The Millionaire Next Door"". That will give you the right mentality. Then read ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" for implementation ideas."
1,The Holy Movement: Matters of the Colon,"This is a story book. If you haven't read anything on the colon and/or disbelieve a cleansing may help you - this book may make you a believer. However, if you are seroius about proceeding into a healthier life style, the book does not offer any direction beyond directing you to other books. Try skipping right towards a ""Jensen"" book to get down to work. When I got this I was beyond the fluff."
1,Error,This title isn't a title af Area. They are a incredible italian group and this isn't a their production
4,"Good, but--!","Any physics textbook would be a good one in the hands of great teachers. However, without a teacher, Tipler's physics probably will not be the good choice. His way of thinking physics has a very unique personal characteristic: simple sentence contains deep meanings but does not have clue to follow. Yes, it is an introductory text, but an introductory text should, I think, explains concepts in a way that is easy for others to read and understand. It should not confuse the naive physics majors but to help them make the basic ideas more clear and familiar. In an advanced point of view, his texts are excellent because the ideas require a considerable amount of thinking. It might have been a great intro. physics series if the sentenses are more concise and ""elementary""!"
3,Can't wait to get it,A poet's guide is manna from heaven. Can't wait to receive mine. Giving readings is something I'm interested in and need the suggestions I know the Poet's Guide will give. Thanks Amazon for marketing great resources as well as novels.
1,This is a sample; it did not cost 42 dollars and you did not save $35,This is a sample; it did not cost 42 dollars and you did not save $35
5,Great Album,"Driller Killer can do no wrong. Every album they've put out is great. The other reviewer, says they have gone completely metal, but they really haven't. It's pretty well produced d beat with a lot of metal influence, but there is no way that they are only metal. Love this album and band."
2,driller killer gone metal,i bought this cd thinking it would be more hard core crust punk like brutalised-{thier 1st album}the singer from this band is from the legendary ANTI CIMEX!! but like so many good punk bands they had to turn their backs on what made them good and turn metal!!! not that i dont like metal i just think it spoils the nature of the band.but the cover on this cd is a classic so buy it just for the cover.
4,Nice followup!,"This second ""Sagittarius"" outing is quite different from its ""Present Tense"" predecessor; it's less orchestrated, earthier, and with a decidedly more mature bent. Long hard to get on LP--and unavailible on CD--this has finally been reissued (NOT from tape, unfortunately, but from LP...kinda inevitable, I guess) with a few nice bonus tracks. Like the first one, listen before you buy, but tracks like ""Gladys"" are well worth the purchase."
2,A novel or runway announcement?,"At least two-thirds of the pages were filled with name-dropping. I mean who needs to know which designer created every single article of clothing the characters wear to set up a storyline? The characters were cliche and one-dimesional, the storyline (in its weak existence) was cliche and it took nearly 200 pages to get the story moving. The climax, though predictable (thanks to the synopsis), was the only save in this book. I guess I was expecting the Deberry/Grant type quality."
4,Slow but good,The book starts off kind of slow...I like to jump right into the storyline but this book is slow to do that. It makes you want to jump ahead of the authors..but it ends with fire that is entertaining!
4,Reads Like A Movie,"Revenge Is Best Served Cold, is an exciting story that speaks to the aspirations in all of us. The story is compelling with a surprise ending. The main characters Morgan and Dakota are savvy, sexy and stylish. Watch out Carey and company (Sex in the City) here's your competition and these designer wearing sister's are fierce!!!"
4,Great Ending!!,This was a great read! I was really surprised at the ending. The only thing that perturbed me was the obsessive focus on designers and what the characters were wearing during every scene. I could have done without the fashion show.
2,"slow,good, great",The beginning of the this book i found it diffucult to continue. The beginng was slow with describing their jobs and who they were. I didn't really find it intresting until Morgan and Dakota met Tyrone. From then on this book kept me interested enough to want to finish it.
1,Horrible,"Pretty crappy book. Too much designer name-dropping for my taste. The writers seemed to happy to make sure they advertised expensive designers than writing an interesting story. Also the storyline was bogus, weak, predictable yet unbelievable. It's hard to believe that two seemingly bright women got duped so easily."
2,Revenge is reading this book,"I can't say enough about 'Revenge is Best Served Cold'. This book has one of the most juvenile and sophomoric plots I've read in a very long time. The dialogue is choppy and the story jumps from event to event without resolution. The flow is silly. The events are silly. The reactions of the main characters are silly. The book is silly.I haven't read anything with this much unnecessary name dropping in a long time. The only thing in it's favor is the ending, although predicable, it was cute. From a book of 296 pages, two good pages is not enough.Save your time and your money. Reading this book is revenge, hot, cold, or otherwise."
1,"Gucci, Prada, Jil Sander, Cartier...give me a break!","I was truly disappointed to have spent [$$$] of my hard-earned money on this book. I am a well read, highly educated attorney, and I have NEVER read such a one-dimensional book in my life - and I have been an avid reader since I can remember. The storyline has potential, but the authors seem hell-bent on portraying these young, African-American ""professional women"" as shallow, materialistic, status-worshipping, and just plain ""silly."" The actions of these women seem completely out of character for the intelligent people the authors would have you believe they are. What a shame. Save your money. According to the authors, you're probably one of the ""have nots"" and can't afford the [$$$]price anyway...and that's if you purchase the paperback - which Dakota and Morgan would NEVER do, I'm sure!"
1,Story Served with Empty Climax,I overlook the plastic protrayal of the two female leads in the book; the overuse of brand labels; the irresponsible use of the race card. But what I can't overlook is the lack of revenge. This story is almost totally without a climax. And that left me cold.
1,Booo and MORE Boo.,"After reading this book, I was pissed. All that name dropping, typical juvenile storyline I just knew I would get past it after a couple of chapters, but the story just went on and on to its obviously predictable ending. Pure garbage. That book is now being used to hold up my coffee table!"
3,I can't believe..,"that it took me 3 weeks to read a book that has less than 300 pages. Anyway, I had the second book and wanted to read this one first. It had a lot of mixed reviews, but I agree there is more fashion name dropping than anything. It was a very slow read not really interesting unless you want to know what everybody is wearing every chapter. And omg, the two older people in book speak like slaves which really was off the wall. It was just ok, I found myself speed reading so i could hurry and finish the book, I refused to read it another day. Needless to say all I missed was the wardrobe descriptions. I hope the other book is better."
3,Disappointed........,"This book made no sense at all to me...What woman working at a Fortune 500 company, would start a business, jeopardize her marriage, and spend her own money to start the business with a complete stranger? It was over all a good read, but the plot was unbelieveable...I would read from these authors again though...."
2,Boring!,Don't rush to buy this book. Borrow it from a friend or check it out at the library if you can because you're going to want to give it back. Both the climax and the resolution occured in the last few chapters. Throughout the story the writers focused too much on the designer clothing of the characters instead of telling the story. I didn't know if I was reading a fashion book or a love story. Revenge only occured in the last couple of chapters. They're going to have to do a lot better if they plan on writing a sequel.
1,"More like ""Montezuma's Revenge""",Being seen with this book is as embarrassing as having throw-up stuck to your hair. It's that juvenile. Maybe the target audience is the Britney Spears crowd. You'd have to be that young and impressionable to even consider this tale.The few attempts the authors made to tell a real story were thwarted by obsessive attention to designer labels while little was devoted to character development and a dramatic apex.And the revenge? It's as shallow and flat as the women carrying the Prada bags.
1,Two minds are a terrible thing to waste...,"I really felt that I wasted time reading this book, however, it did put me to sleep(literally). There was just too much name dropping whether in regard to restaurants, clothing or other items. Why did it take 200 plus pages for the plot to reveal itself. I am looking for sheer entertainment. I want to read a book whereas I can pick up ten years from now and enjoy it again. This book will end up in the trash. If I could have given it half of a star I would have. I hope their second proves to be much better. One thing is certain, ""Two minds are a terrible thing to waste."""
4,Good read,I overall thought this was a good read. I felt close to the characters. With each dilemma it felt like it was my own. This book could have gotten 5 stars but it just took too long to get to the point. The title of the book is basically based on the last couple of chapters. I have to admit though the end did catch me by surprise. I would have never guessed!!!!!!
3,Straightforward,"Here's a very down-to-earth album of 60s style jazz funk, minimized to comply with the requirements of that era: bass, drums, guitar, and sax. The riffs are pretty familiar, but well played. However, some of the pieces seem to be redundant--you kind of hear the same thing you heard two or three songs ago.This is not a bad album. If you like this kind of music, then you should buy it. Not something that will burn the barn down."
5,FUNKAJAZZALICIOUS!,"funky, jazzy and everything in between; easily hooked jams to play while driving or at home in need of a pick me up! lotta sax and sticky drums!"
4,Quite brilliant doom metal production.,"This is a fantastic album from a great new doom-metal outfit from Australia. With great harmonies and prodominant female vocals, its a must for fans of The Gathering, Lacuna Coil, etc."
3,mommadjones,I will give the reasons I like and dis like this toy.Like;1) The best feature of this toy is the wheels have speed adjustments which is very helpful on hardwood floors.2) The base of the toy is very durable.Dislikes;1) The front doors on this toy do not stay on. They are easily removed by my son who was only 8 months old at the time of purchase. This is the biggest detriment and a big reason I would not purchase this toy again if I had the choice.Overall the cons outweighed the pros. The price is somewhat reasonable but I think that it could be a bit less with the cosmetic issues of the toy. These door issues had to be evident at the time the toy was tested by the toy company and they decided to go ahead with the flawed design anyway.
2,Dissatisfied!,"We got this walker as a gift for our 8-month old son. He is just learning to pull up and stand on his own so we were excited to get a walker as a gift. I have not compared this to other ones, but it's not very stable. It can easily be tipped, especially when he runs into a door or something. If he pushes hard enough he topples over the front of it. He has also lost his balance and fallen backwards. I just expected it to be a little more sturdy like some of his other toys. I understand it can't be perfect and expect some falls, but it seems cheap to me. The little doors (mail slots) ALWAYS come off. Again, just seems cheap. He loves this toy, however! He pushes it everywhere!One good thing is that the wheels can adjust so that it goes slow or fast depending on the floor or the skill of the child. That is really a good thing and has worked for us.Other than that, though, I've been a little dissatisfied with it."
4,Little Tykes Walker,"We got this walker for our daughter when she was about 9 months old because she was starting to cruise around things and we thought maybe a walker would be fun. There was more assembly than we had expected, not difficult but it was not out of the box ready. We discovered quickly that mail carrier was not in this walkers future. The doors have not been on it since the first week. They come off so easily that our daughter rips them off whenever she sees them. She likes to put her dolls in the walker and push it around like a stroller. (she is now a year old) I like the feature that lets you put the wheels away, it works well for controlling out of control older siblings. The only warning I have is that the wheels are slick on hardwood floors for little ones that are not sturdy on their feet yet. I looked around though and couldn't find one that was good on hardwood anyway. Overall this toy has been played with off and on and has held up very well."
3,Not very well made.,"This is a nice walker, except that the pieces on front pull right off. They need to redo this model with stay in place pieces. My son did learn to walk with this, and it is nice because it has a ""speed"" control."
1,Dangerous for your pre-walking toddler,"This toy appears to be pretty neat, but alas it is not. My daughter was always trying to play with it from the front and would pull up on it to put the envelopes in the mailbox and when she leaned on it, the doors fell off, and she fell face first into it. One time she fell into it she got a huge knot on her forehead w/a nasty purple bruise. This toy went in the trash after 2 weeks. We are totally not thrilled with this especially being made by Little Tikes, which is a brand we have always trusted!! I do not recommend this toy to any child, no matter what the age - it is not safe!"
2,Brady & Riley's Grandmother,"I bought this for my twin nine month old grandsons for christmas. The problem I have is that I can not get the speed of the wheels adjusted. No matter what setting I put them on the walker goes too fast and they fall. I find that they are always removing the mailbox doors . They also get their fingers caught in the doors. It is cute for the price, but I wish I had bought just a regular old fashioned walker like my children used thirty years ago."
3,Fairly pleased,"The pieces do come off fairly easily, but my son gets a kick out of it. He pulls the door, giggles, waits for me to put it back, and then we start all over. He has tried to climb it a few times, but that happens with the entertainment center also. He's just at that age (almost 10 mo)and I really can't fault the toy for it.There is a certain risk of falling over, but that's why I make sure to stay with him. If you have the time to walk along side them, or be at an arms length, it's great. I've seen other reviews from people who were unhappy with the toy, and I noticed that a few, not all, were being used by children under the recommened age.I admit that there is room for improvement with the toy, but my son seems happy with it. Once I tried to help him steer it away from a speaker, he'd gotten mad and pushed my hand off. He seems to love the fact that he cross a room ""all by himself""."
2,Do not buy this for your baby,"This toy falls over every time my nine month old tries to brace himself to stand up and push it. Also, the mail slots fall off constantly. Overall, this toy is dangerous and a waste of money."
2,TOY WILL SCRATCH YOUR HARDWOOD FLOORS!!,"When I bought this walker I did not realize that the rear wheels are not on an axle and therefore do not spin easily (they are secured with screws). The wheel control is on the front wheels, so you would think that the rear wheels would spin easily. They do not, and will seriously scratch your hardwood floors. We had our floors refinished two years ago and now, due to this toy, they will need to be refinished again. This is a very poor design. And, as others have mentioned, the doors come off very easily. My son likes playing with the doors, but gets frustrated when they keep coming off. The other toys on the walker do not interest him at all. I will say that the walker is sturdy."
3,Not For Beginners!,"I purchased this toy for my son when he had just started pulling up. This proved unwise, as the walker has a tendency to flip when he put pressure on the handle. Also, my son was more interested in the safety levers on the handle than actually walking with it. I agree with other reviews, the bits on the front come off very easily and prove frustrating to open and close as they come apart.My son did enjoy the spinner on the front, and after he was able to stand up unassisted the toy was less of a hazard. My recommendation: wait until your child is standing independently before buying this toy!"
1,wish i never built it,"My son received this for his first bithday and has yet to get any good use out of it. It has no balance capability, so your child is always at risk of falling back. Also the door flaps are poorly made and always falling off. Basicly I don't recomend any one to buy this toy. I would have been really upset had I purchased it my self."
2,Doors fall off,"I got this as a gift for our daughter when she was around 10 months old. All the other reviews are right - the doors break off WAY TOO EASILY! But our daughter really liked it, and for that one month, she used it as a walker to help her walk.Now she uses it with her playhouse, and sticks all kinds of things into it. She is now a year and a half and though it sits along the wall, she still uses it with her other toys. When her friends come over, they always want to play with it for 2-3 minutes, and then they move on. The other noise-makers on the walker keep little 1 year olds interested for a little while as well.I think it was a great gift, but I would not have bought it. 2 stars for durability (due to the doors - they are still somewhere around the house)."
1,didn't care for it,the doors on the front fell off... then they pinched her fingers when she tried to open an close them.
1,POOR,"THIS PRODUCTS DOES NOT HOLD UP, IT FALLS A PART FROM GET GO. NOT REALLY SAFE FOR TODDLER LEARNING TO WALK. SORRY BUT TRUTH. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED SUSANNA/NANNA SC"
2,Waste of money,After researching several walkers online - I chose this product because of the adjustable wheel speed. I was very disappointed. After spending 20 minutes assembling all the parts with screws and a screwdriver--my daughter pulled off the doors on the front-in about 1 minute. Next-she tried to stand up to walk and it fell right one top of her. I had to hold it still while she stood up-but it still was too light weight and tipped to easily. Also the smooth plastic wheels slid right across the rug so the speed adjustment feature was mute. The toy was so boring that within 5 minutes she was off doing something else. Needless to say I was disappointed and will be returning it immediately.
2,Missing pieces and poor construction,"Like other reviewers, I thought the only good thing was the speed control on the wheels. Unfortunately, my box was missing the screws to attach the large blue handle. The exposed sides were dangerous, and my daughter pulled the lids off then used the spaces as stairs to climb the toy. Of course it couldn't support her weight, so she fell over. I removed it quickly after that."
3,Great toy if you have tons of spare time on your hands for assembly,"This toy is great and my daughter loves it, only problem is that it comes in a million pieces and you have to assemble each one of them by reading a picture, not actual instructions, but a picture type diagram - which only makes it more confusing. In addition, i'm constantly putting the ""doors"" back on the toy because they're just barely held on by a little tiny bump of plastic - anyways, my daughter enjoys chewing on those so i guess it's not a loss. Decent toy for the money, but i'm sure that theres much better out there."
1,Not impressed,"I bought this for my son because he is walking along furniture and I thought it might help learn to walk. I loved that it said it had adjustable speed, but on our carpet the wheels don't turn at all it just glides over the floor just as fast. We have also had the mail door problem. The worst thing about this toy is that my son was playing with the mail slot while I was putting his laundry away and I heard this awful screaming. He got his little finger stuck in the side and had his other hand pushing the mail door shut with all his body weight, by the time I got to him and released his finger it was white, and then bruised shortly after. I removed the doors and put them away so he can't get them, but he hasn't touched this toy since. This has been a total waste of money for our family."
2,"Got as a gift, would not buy","I was disappointed in the design. Little Tikes usually makes such great things. My son started playing with this at 9-10 months and even then he could pull the doors right off. It was not very good if they were intended to be used as mail slots to learn how to put things in and take them back out.I agree with the other poster that he was not at all interested in any of the other toys on it like the caterpiller or little bugs. My son did walk at 10 months and has not stopped to rest since. He only pushes this on occassion.Like I said, we received it as a gift but I would never buy this one on my own."
3,Doors come off!,"My son loves this toy. He got it for Xmas, and is still playing with it even though he is an excellent walker. The problem is that the ""doors"" come off very easily, leaving a groove perfect for my little one to climb onto! The cart is also so lighweight that even before he could walk on his own, he was able to pick it up and fall when putting it down sideways."
3,Not that bad...,"I bought this for my 8 month old as she is now cruising things. I'll admit it's VERY light and tippy, but that doesn't mean they don't figure it out pretty quickly. She can pull herself up on it and she's now learning to walk with my help. If I let her go on her own I think she might fall forward. Once the kids have good balance this toy is great. I don't like how easily the flaps come off of though. I'm constantly putting them back on. The envelopes are good chew toys!"
2,The two pieces on the front will not stay on.,The two pieces on the front will not stay on. And my friend has a different one and it looks more durable.
3,no too bad,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 10 months old. She really didn't get it at first. She just wanted to play (eat) the little envelopes!The two doors on the front come off very easy. She tries to use these to pull herself up and they just come right off and she usually lands on her butt!She just started getting the concept of pushing the bar to make it move so she can walk. It does tip over VERY easy, she pulls it on herself all the time. It's pretty light though so she doesn't really get hurt.One bad thing though, we have hard wood floors downstairs, and I put the wheels on the highest resistance, and the thing just flies across the floor anyway. To many boo boo's, so we took it upstairs and she does pretty good. I've noticed on mine that no matter what I have the wheels set at they really don't move at all, so they just kind of glide across the carpet.all in all it's a good toy for the money. She still, at 12 months, is really only interested in the mail!"
3,Not the best but it works,My son is 11 months old. He was so proud when he could walk behind this toy. The only feature that we used was the tension setting for speed of the wheels. The decals were not used and the envelopes found their way to the bottom of the toy box. Overall once my son could walk he spent most of his time flipping it over to try to get to the tiny pieces on the back. I had to take it out of the play room.
2,"Fun toy, but needs some work",My daughter loved to play with this toy. The only problem was the doors come off way to easy. The first thing she would do when she played with this was take the doors off. They need to do something to secure them. It also tends to tip back when she tries to walk with it. I think your better off trying a different toy if you are looking for something that will help your child walk. Ours now takes up space in the garage.
2,not the best,"Too unstable - it tips when they pull up to stand. Also the plastic flaps, which my son would normally love, came out to easily to be any fun."
4,"No Frills, but I like that!","I would rather not have a toy with a lot of frills. This was purchased in an effort to help my son walk, and because he was sure footed and cruising already, he had no problems taking to it at 9 months (and 23 pounds). The doors on the front do come off super easy, but that isn't a concern of mine. If my son gets to the point to where he takes it off to use as a stair to get on furniture, I will simply super-glue the doors on there so that he can't.I do believe it is sturdy, though. I think that is proven by my son's age, weight, and use of the toy.There are probably ""better"" choices out there, but I think the price is right and so is the product. It isn't always necessary to have the perfect and most expensive choice out there."
1,Wish I would have bought a Fisher Price Walker,"I bought this for my 10 month old daughter as she had been cruising for about 1 1/2 months and I thought she would enjoy having something to practice walking with and push. I'm not happy at all with the durability. She is constantly pulling the mailbox slots off (they come off VERY easily) and has squished her fingers in them on more than one occasion. Once she pulls them off, she likes to stand in the opening thing which looks really cute but it's really dangerous as I can just see her tumbling backwards. She isn't interested in the toy things - the catepillar is too hard to move back and forth. Overall, I wish I would have bought one of the Fisher Price walkers - they seem much sturdier and don't have parts that come off so easily.I would recommend you shop around before purchasing this one."
2,There are better products out there,"We received this as a gift for my third child. The older two used a wonderful one that gave out after the second one and unfortunately, they're not made anymore. This one only has two advantages over the old one: (1) it has a wheel control (like those on roller skates) to tighten the wheel so it won't go too fast for the baby learning to walk and (2) it's much easier to make it go flat or sit it back up right - I broke a lot of fingernails trying to make the old one change positions.The two doors, like the other reviewers said, come off way too easily. Once they're off -- there is little left on the toy except the boring sliders (in comparison to other baby toys). The three ""letters"" just float around the junk pile and are a waste.At least, the walker has two handles - one on top for standing, and one on the back for walking on knees, which my baby likes to do. I'm glad it wasn't me who bought this."
1,Good for a busted Lip,"My husband and I bought this toy for my 8 month old daughter. We liked it because it was the only one on the market that had "" cruise control"" and we thought that would be important since we have hardwood floors. We spent almost an hour putting it together and then we let the little one try it out. At first she was so excited to play with the toys. But as soon as she opened the mail box and started to climb up. The the flap popped off and she fell on the front of the walker busting her lip. Needless to say it went back to the toy store and we bought the playzone activity walker. She likes the colors, sounds and sturdy craftsmanship better than the little tikes."
3,As many problems as perks...,"This was a gift, and I quickly noticed how dull most of the ""activities"" on it were, and that she couldn't really do them herself at 7 months (and doesn't really care anymore at 10 months). Here we are at 10 months, and she gets more out of it as we go. She really enjoys opening and closing the doors and ""mailing"" the letters, but I am SO SICK of having to re-attach the doors. Couldn't they have made them just a little sturdier? Also, when she was first cruising, she could not keep up with the walker, and would fall. She is just now able to keep up while walking behind it. However, keep an eye out, because if they try to pull up with it, it'll tip right over (hence some people's safety concerns). It really should be weighted a little bit better. Lauren does get a lot of use out of this toy, but if it were not a gift, I would probably choose a more durable walking toy."
3,"Not bad, might be better to shop around","My 11 month old likes this. They door come off VERY easily but they are also very easy to snap back on. Our son is just learning to walk so I have the wheels as tight as they can be and I still think they're a little loose. When he goes from the carpet to the hardwood floor this lightweight walker moves so quickly he lands on his knees. However, I guess he is learning about hardwood floors this way. He likes it, but if I had to do it again I'd shop around for a sturdier walker."
3,It's a Walker.,"This wouldn't have been my choice for a walker. It was a gift. We ended up with two different ones. This one is still used by my 16 month old walker. She still loves it. <br /><br />A Tip to those of you whose doors come off: Take the top one and put it on the bottom! I can't get it off & more importantly, my daughter can't get it off. So we usually have one door on (the top one on the bottom). She puts her toys in there and pushes them around. The mail is all over the house. <br /><br />A plus is it takes NO BATTERIES!!!! While that might mean it's less entertaining it's not going to drain batteries thus drain your pocket book.<br /><br />"
1,this is a waste of money,"i bought this toy for my 7month old son who was standing and walking while holding on to things but this toy was a total waste of money. he did great walking while holding on to it for a while but if he pulled back on it both him and the toy would hit the floor and then after he started walking at 8months, he could rip the covers off the front way... too easily and once he realized that they would come off so easily, he continuously pulled them right off and walk around with it in his hand while never bothering with the rest of the toy so it was pretty much useless after that."
3,Good for the purpose,"I bought this for my son when he was learning to walk, mainly becaue it had the wheel speed control. I had a walker but it was hard for him to keep up with. Like most of the other reviewers have said the doors come off way to easy. That has been the only problem I've had with it. The speed adjustment was great when he was first starting out, he wasn't falling flat on his face like with the original walker I had. It also worked great outside in the grass unlike the other walker . My son has loved the walker from day one and and even though he's walking on his own now he still plays with it... to chase the dog!"
2,walker,"DO NOT BUY this walker. My son uses it to help him walk, but he is more interested in pulling the doors off and throwing them all over the room. The fact that everything comes apart distracts him from the real purpose of the walker... to help him take steps on his own! Instead he sits down to pull off parts."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"We bought this for my 10 month old daughter. Where do I start. The brakes do not prevent this contraption from slipping and sliding sideways and forward so every time she hangs on she slides face forward on the ground. Now she is afraid to walk with it. She will try to put the envelopes in the mail slot, which just like the others has broken off countless times and she has cut her face from falling forward. Dont leave your child alone with this product."
2,I wouldn't buy this again,I have this for my 12 month old son. It is not sturdy at all. Don't buy this with the idea that it will help balance your child and assist in walking. It is so flimsy that it tips over anytime my son tries to pull himself up.The only thing he liked about it is the plastic envelopes that he could remove. He lost interest in this toy in about a week.
4,fun for both my kids,"I was a little leary of this after reading the other reviews, but I had already bought it, so I took it out of the box. You have to understand, I am not a logical thinker, and have a hard time putting anything together. But once I got past the fact that there were no written instructions, I figured it out pretty easily. Armed with only a philips screwdriver, I managed to get it together with only a few curses - all by myself!! even with my baby trying to climb all over it. He (nine months old) loves to walk with it - and it moves at just the right speed for a beginner. My four year old daughter will fight with him to play with it (is that good?). So, it's not one of the toys in the corner gathering dust because no one wants to play with it. I'm glad I bought it, and I love watching my son smile as he walks -all by himself."
3,A not so durable walker,We bought this walker for our 10 month old twin boys. They love to push this walker through the house. But we find that the wheels hardly turn on it making it harder to push. But the worse thing about this toy is that the front doors do not stay in place! The boys took them off as soon as we put it together. It's like the people who made this toy have not had children or something. This thing leaves pieces all over our living room. They also have no intrest in the bee and the other stuff on the front. I would not buy this toy over again. I would shop arround for a different walker without removable parts.
2,Not impressed,We bought this item for our 10 month old's First Christmas. At first he loved walking with it but he soon became distracted by removing the front two doors . He then only became interested in trying to sit and stand inside the area the doors were removed from. I think the doors coming off so easily is a dangerous feature. My son leaned on one of them and it snapped off and he fell into the walker and scratched his face. I personally think it should be recalled. The bugs in the front are very hard for a small child to manuever. I am going to look for a better walker.
2,LOOK FOR ANOTHER TOY,"MY SON GOT THIS AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT WHEN HE WAS 7 MONTHS OLD. RIGHT FROM THE START HE WAS PULLING OFF THE MAIL SLOT DOORS. I'D PUT THEM BACK ON AND HE'D TAKE THEM RIGHT OFF. SO I FIGURED I'D PUT IT AWAY UNTIL HE WAS STARTING TO WALK. NOW THAT HE IS, THIS TOY IS STILL USELESS. THE WHEELS HAVE A LOCKING FEATURE, BUT WHETHER IT'S ON OR OFF, THE WHEELS DON'T SEEM TO MOVE WELL, THEY JUST DON'T SEEM TO GO AROUND. AND AS FOR THE BEE AND THE WORM, IT'S HARD TO PUSH THEM TO PLAY WITH. I HATE THIS TOY AND WISH I NEVER OPENED IT."
3,cute idea...needs work,"I just bought this toy for my 10 month old son. Though it is very cute, it does have its defects. Like other reviewers said, the mail slot doors come off way too easily, he figured that out in seconds. It also needs to be weighted better in the front because though its ""wider wheel base"" helps it not tip sideways, it still always comes flying backwards onto him when he sits down while holding the handle. I would love it if they worked on a few things. My son loves the little ""mail envelopes"" as they are the perfect size for him!"
3,"EXCELLENT, but doors fall off","My daughter loves this toy, but the mail doors fall off very easily. Now we just leave the doors off. It still serves its purpose. 5 stars for idea, but needs to be redesigned."
4,Great toy for both my kids,"I bought this for my 8 month old who is learning to walk. She absolutely loves walking around the house with this and gets the biggest smile on her face! For that alone, it's worth the $20. It is bright and cheerful looking. When my husband put it together I had him readjust the toys on the front (the moving bee and caterpillar) so they would be looser and easier for her to move back and forth. Yes, as everyone else said, the mailbox covers come off way too easily, but that isn't too important to us. My 2 year old is the one who pulls them off. I will try the suggestion from a previous reviewer of putting the top slot on the bottom. My 2 year old has had fun with this toy, too. She likes the novelty of pushing it around the house and then watching as her baby sister does it. I would definitely buy this again. :)"
2,Does not hold up!,"I bought this walker for my ten month old and 2 mins after we put it together, the doors are pulled off. They don't stay on and the ""letters"" then just fall out and it's very hard my son to turn it. I packed it up and brought out my daughter's old fisher price walker, much better quality!"
2,Shoddy construction,"WE bought this for our daughter to play with when she was learning to walk. THe mail is difficult to put into the holders and it frustrated her. The little drawers that open up to put items in fall off the cart! After using it a few times, the bottom one fell off completely, causing a huge temper tantrum of frustration. IT does adjust in its speeds (ie it gives more resistance for those that are still unsteady) which is nice."
2,Plastic doors on front come right off!,"I didnt like this toy at all. As all the others say, the plastic door on the front come right off. My baby enjoys putting the letters in, but they slide right out. Very poor construction."
1,somewhat impressed,I bought this toy with the hope that I could encourage my 9 month old to start walking. He pulled off the pieces and scattered them everywhere. For 1/2 the money I found another similar toy that works just as well.
1,Not Safe,"I just watched my 10 month old daughter topple over with this contraption on top of her. From the moment we put this thing together my wife and I were concerned about it. If you have hardwood floors be prepared to chase your child around as the walker simply slides uncontrollably across the floor. My biggest criticism is that the weight distribution is totally screwed up. Presumably, this walker is being used by children who are learning to walk. When our daughter pulls herself up on the handle, there is not enough weight in the front to prevent the walker from tipping over. I'm no engineer, but something about the design is all wrong. Ours is going in the trash."
2,Flimsy,"Just put this together for my 7-month old who is starting to stand and cruise. Like the other reviewers, I was shocked at how easily the doors came off. He tried to stand using one hand on a door, and it came off and he fell. This is going back to the store!"
1,Don't waste your money.,"This product is just awful. My son (10 months) rec'd it as a Christmas gift and it stands there empty all of the time. The doors fall off. The sticker inside says ""removable door for easy acess"". What a joke. I bet that sticker was an after thought when they realized how bad of a product it really was. I am sick of putting this thing together 10 times a day. When my teenagers were young, I trusted the name ""little tikes"" because their toys were usually better than the others because they seemed to be more rugged and used heavier plastics. It's a shame how they have changed. I am very dissapointed. - Lisa"
4,Great toy,"We recieved this as a hand-me-down from my sister-in-law. Her daughter played with it from one year to eighteen months and loved it. The doors do come off the front very easily (for cleaning purposes it claims), and it does require parental supervision. She can't pull herself up on with it tipping over and it doesn't steer very well, but the speed adjustment puts it far ahead of similar toys, and she just lights up when playing with it and can't stop laughing. Overall it works well for us, we just colaspe it when we aren't walking around with her. When calasped she loves to play with the attivity board."
3,"Nice, but a pain to put together.","My 15 month old son loves this walker, but it was a pain to put together. You have to assemble EVERYTHING. Right down to the decals. I guess that is the reason it was so inexpensive. The quality is fine, but if I were to buy another one, I would get one that had more interesting toys. As a walker it is fine, although the doors come off very easily and for the first few days my son continuously disassembled it. Also the bees and worms are hard to move. Perhaps I didn't assemble them perfectly."
2,U get what U pay for...,"It's cute, it holds my 11 month's old attention for a brief period. She loves to place the mail in the slots. The slots do not stay on they do fall off quit easily. But they slip in pretty easy too. It's a great push toy. Don't expect much. It is pretty flimsy. The bright colors are attractive though."
1,Tips over easily,This walker is not very sturdy. It tips over easily. The toys on the front are not easy to use or very engaging.
2,Don't bother,"It was easy to put together. I just wish it would stay together. The doors on the front for the pretend mail are worthless. I wish this toy had more activity things for the child to be impressed with, because I was not! Get another walker toy, I would not recommend this one."
1,Very Unsafe - Should be Recalled,As other users have stated - there is not enough weight at the base of this toy to keep it grounded when a child is using the handle to pull up. It does fall on the baby when he falls using it. This toy is being thrown away at my house - my morals will not allow me to sell or donate it risking the endangerment of another child.
1,Not a good toy,"This toy is not recommended for babies learning to walk. It is flimsy and when my son falls backwards it winds up falling on top of him and frightens him, sometimes even hitting his face. There should be more weight to the bottom of the thing to help keep it stable. I wish I knew this before I purchased this item. Instead of assisting my baby with walking, it hurts him."
4,does what it is meant to do,"we recently bought this walker for our 9 month old. he loves it.we like it because it doesn't have music; noise; yet another toy with the ""ABC"" song....it does what is was intended to do...be a walker! He loves the envelopes, and is getting good at putting them into the mailbox. Yes, the doors come off easily, but our Leapfrog table has a purple door that pops off just as easily. Plus this walker wasn't expensive."
2,This toy is dangerous!,"This push-toy is nice when pushed. But the doors come off very easily and once they are off, my daughter climbs into the shelf on the front of the toy. That is very dangerous! Plus, the busy-box features on the front are lame, and the ""letters"" are a waste, they just wind up scattered all over the house. I wish we'd gotten her a different walker."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,this is a terrible toy! Like all of the other reviews say the mail doors come off way to easy. Both of my boys would try to walk with it but the toy would not stay up and they both just fell on there backs. And then within 2 days the toy would just collapse! Once I walked in the boys bedroom just in time to see one of the boys standing on the toy where the doors are supposed to be lifting himself up to the crib and almost falling. I just with I could return this toy. What a waste of money and it is too dangerous to donate.
2,Spend your $ on something else,I bought this for my son when we was 9 months old (he had been walking around the furniture for over a month). My main complaint about this toy is that the doors come off very easily. Garrett loved the letters and opening the doors but as soon as they came off he was scooting them around the floor. I think he used the walker feature 2 or 3 times. I returned it after a few weeks.
1,KEEP ON LOOKING~DON'T BUY IT!,"I bought this for my 10 month old son. It is pretty sturdy, however, the doors as well as the envelopes that come with it are lost somewhere in the house! The doors do come off with little or no effort and thus making it possible for my son to climb onto it and stand, which makes me very leary to turn around for a moment, because it looks like he will tip over. He played with it for approximately 30 minutes and his 4 year old brother like to use it to try to run over him and the dog with it! I like the speed control of the wheels, but would be better if the wheels clicked or made noise of some kind. It doesn't teach you anything at all! Keep on looking unless you are prepared to keep putting on the doors and not let them climb on it!"
2,Terrible design -- not fun,"Not worth the money. There are better walkers out there. I agree with some other posts that the little doors or whatever you call them come of way to easy. I am sick of picking them up off the floor. I got this because my son loved the walker a friend of mine had for their baby, so I figured they were all alike and bought this one. I was wrong. He hardly touches this one, but loves any OTHER walker he comes in contact with. Not enough integrated toys on this one to make him happy - especially once the doors fall off."
4,"no flash, but good","If you are like me and SICK of toys that play music and have flashing lights, then this simple walker is for you. Because it folds up flat easily, we would take it to the park with our 10 month old son and set it up on the grass. My son would push it from one end of the park to the other end happily. And when he got tired, he would sit and post the letters (or whatever else he got his hands on), or play with the buttons. Yes, it occasionally tipped, but no harm occurred, and what toddler isn't going to go face down from time to time? And because it is so simple, I never worried about getting dirt, grass or sand in it - it washed off easily. But here is what really struck me - a kid at the park came up to us and started playing with the walker. After pushing the numbers (stickers really), he complained ""this doesn't do anything"". My son would disagree."
1,"Poor quality, poor design","This walker is unstable and falls over when my baby tries to pull himself up. It also collapses when my baby tries to walk with it. It is probably the worst one I have ever seen. Save your money, and save your baby from a horrible fall. Don't buy this walker!"
2,Dangerous Toy,"I bought this walker whe my son was standing up on his own and trying to learn how to walk. It was too dangerous for him to use before he could walk because it would tip over whenever he leaned on it. Now that he can walk, it is too dangerous for him to use because he tries to climb on it and it tips over. So I would not recommend this toy."
4,Lots of Fun,My son has loved this toy since he was about 6 months. He is now 11 months and walks all over the house with it. It's great because he could play with it flat on the floor and then when he was ready we turned it into a walker. It is durable enough for him to push around yet isn't beating up all of our furniture and doorways. I recommend it for the money.
2,Frustrating,"This walker was purchased for my 9 month old little girl as a gift. The minute I put it together it started falling apart. The mailbox doors never stay on because my daughter is always taking them off. One of the doors are missing now as well. The other little bugs on the toy she never touches because they are to hard to move. However, she does like to run around the house pushing the cart, then she falls over on her face and the toy comes tumbling down on her. (So much for the ""adjustable wheels"") I do not feel this is a quality toy, there are better and safer walkers out there."
3,Great for walking but that is it!,My 9 month old daughter likes this toy and uses this to walk across the room. She uses this toy every day. The compartments do fall off easily and usually end up all over the place but it is very good for walking.
3,Fun toy but pieces fall off too easily!,"My little one liked to push this toy around as she was learning to walk but we always seemed to have trouble keeping the plastic pieces on the toy. With four children, I dislike having to search for ""lost"" pieces. On the positive side, it has a wide base and is easy for toddlers to push. It also has bright colors. I love Little Tikes toys but I don't think I would purchase this item again."
1,Worthless Piece of Crud!,"I bought this walker after much debate over the fisher price one. The only reasons I decided on this one was because it said you could adjust the speed of the wheels, and because we have purchased many ""Little Tykes"" products in the past and had been happy. WELL...You can't adjust the speed of this walker because it just slides on the floor. And Those Stupid Pieces Of CRUD Mailbox doors keep getting pulled off. I have twin girls and after they would pull off the mailbox doors, one will stand in the dang walker while the other one pushed it...can you say ""emergency room here we come""!Neadless to say-I have now put this one in the closet and went to buy the Fisher Price light and sounds walker...much better!"
4,Door Problems,"I bought this walker despite what the reviews said, I now see for myself how right they are about the doors ! My 8 month old granddaughter loves to walk and play with the walker it is very stable and I love the break controls on the wheels, the ONLY problem is the doors want stay on! Surely they could come up with a better door! All in all the price and the over-all performance is worth the buy! We just don't use the doors!"
2,Not a good choice,"Yes, unfortunately I have to agree w/what a lot of parents are saying...my 10 1/2 month old daughter who loves to ""cruise"" is not that interested in this other than to take off the doors (which come off WAY too easily) and then she stands on it which seems incredibly unsafe. This is not a good choice."
1,"POOR quality ""mailboxes"" WON'T stay on..Keeps falling off!","My son who is now 15 months old got this when he was 8 months old and just learning to stand and ""cruise"". My son still uses it, and loves to push it around. However, this item was purchased new, and since day one, the mailboxes have yet to stay on. They keep falling off even with the smallest amount of pressure...so we just now leave them off because frankly, they're useless at this point. The workmanship is poor. So in essence, this toy is just used to push around the house...and little else. I hope other people who have gotten this don't have the same trouble! I'm just glad I didn't shell out my own money for this!"
5,Love it!,"I absolutley love this walker (and so does my son)! My son is now 10 months old and loves to walk. We received the FP Brilliant Basics Walker as a gift, but we soon found out that it wasn't for us. It was lightweight and flimsy. Everytime my son tried to use it, it would push ahead of him and he would end up on his knees or on his face...not exactly the right way to help a baby learn to walk.My MIL bought our son this walker and he just loves it! The speed/traction control feature is a must! Gone are the days of him falling on his face or to his knees. He can actually walk across the room with this and it doesn't fly out from under him.Yes, the mailbox doors come off very easily, but so what?! My son likes to take them off and play with them. When the doors are off, you can put a favorite toy there instead. My son loves to push around his stuffed animals.Overall....great, sturdy walker for the price. Very pleased!"
2,Soooo disappointed!,"Like nearly ALL of these reviews, I was really excited to buy this product for my 1 year old who is just beginning to ""cruise"". Not 5 minutes after I'd put the toy together, she had crawled up on the green mail flap, it snapped off, and she fell to the base. No split lip, but a flurry of tears. I can't believe how poorly-made those doors are! An infant can pull them off?! I agree with one of the reviewers stating that that alone should be reason for a recall. As well as this, the toy (when collapsed) is not flat enough to provide a sturdy base for a budding and unstable new walker to play on. Very disappointing."
2,Disappointment,"I bought this walker because it looked nice and sturdy for my 11-month-old, who cannot wait to walk on his own. He rarely uses it as a walker though. He's more interested in pulling the doors off the front of it, and on more than one occasion has used it as a climbing tool. Once he even fell and split his lip open. The doors on this thing should be attatched better, and barring that, the toy should be recalled."
4,Please don't buy,I recently purchased this toy for my daughter. She had so much fun with it until she leaned on the front of it and the pin that holds it open snapped and it collapsed causing her to fall and scrape her back. We did not use it improperly. I feel that we may have gotten a defective one since I have not seen anyone else complain of this problem. I wrote a letter to Little tikes today so I have not recieved a reply yet. I just wanted to let you all know incase there is more than one defective one out there.
2,Front keeps falling off,"We bought this one for our son because we liked the option of being able to control the wheel speed (our two year old learned on the Fisher Price model). While we were pleased with the speed control button, the front pieces fall off so easily that our little guy falls repeatedly while trying to play with them because one light touch makes them fall off. And, frankly, it adds one more thing that I'm constantly putting back together during the day!! Hope that Little Tykes redesigns the front to fit a bit more snugly. Otherwise, we'd recommend it."
2,"Cute, not sturdy as it should be, doors fall off - overall ok","This is a tough one. Overall I would rate this toy as fair. It's not terrible and my daughter, when she was stable and could walk with a walker, used this and did fine.But the doors on the front are a PAIN. They have fallen off at least 100 times and for this reason alone, I would say get another walker. It's just not worth the minor irritation of having to constantly put them back on when there are many other walkers that don't have this issue. We moms have enough little battles to fight every day than to have to ""put back"" pieces that should not be falling off every single time the little one gets his/her hands on it. My son uses it now and it's just the same thing. Sorry - not worth it."
3,I hope these are only ironic gag gifts,"I hope no one would actually use these cards in lieu of real parenting or an actual sincere apology and immediate removal of the problem child. I hope these were designed with the only intention of people giving them to parents as a 'gag' new baby gift. You know something to open the parents eyes to these real life situations they will be presented with upon the growing up of their child and interactions in public places. Little cards of wisdom to show how NOT to allow your child to behave, ie. how about NOT let your child make a restaurant look like a rock band just trashed the place? We can only hope any recipient of these is intelligent enough to use them as a forethought, instead of an after thought."
1,Call it what it is: A bribe as a substitute for forethought and courtesy,"Yes, in theory it could be a humorous attempt to diffuse an awkward, unanticipated situation. But the operative word here is ""unanticipated."" You knew darn well that when you took your 'terrible twos' toddler to the tony, intimate restaurant that he/she might very well act like, um....., a 'terrible twos' toddler. So thanks for nothing as you drag the rest of us into your brave new world while you paper over your outed selfishness with tacky retail largesse."
1,"Not Funny, Insulting to Parents","Someone thought this would be funny for me as a new parent, but I thought it was really horrible. It's more smug and anti-kid then anything. Do you have a friend that resents that you have a new baby? Do you know someone that hates children? This is what they are thinking but maybe not saying to you. Do not buy!"
4,Inspiring,"I was close to fifteen years old when I picked up Redwall and to be honest it wasn't because the book had been receiving rave reviews among my peers. It was simply a book to pass the half hour Silent Reading period they had in school.As I started to read it though, I gradually became more and more interested in the atmosphere of Redwall Abbey and Cluny and everything that happened in between.This book is responsible for catapulting me into appreciating novels for the first time. I would not recommend that you hand over this book to a kid who doesn't like to read period, but if they have some interest then hand over this book. It's labelled as a children's book, but it really has a transitional writing that helps bring teenagers into adult literature."
5,THE FUNNEST ADVENTURE BOOK ALIVE,THIS BOOK MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS IN THE BOOK FIGHTING CLUNY AND HIS GANG OF RATS!!!!!!
5,It was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I thought that Mr. Jacques did an excelent job of describing the characters, objects, and buildings. He put a lot of detailed and facinating things on them. The best thing about the book was that he made it seem like there were a couple stories going on at one time. He did it perfectly by using chapters. There were never two things going on in one chapter. I highly recommend reading this book, I enjoyed it very much. If you are a person who has interest in action-packed books, then this is the one to read."
5,"redwall,a great book","My favorite book this year has been Redwall, part of the Redwall series. One of the reasons I like Redwall so much is because of Matthias. He really just brightens up the book. He is a brave, strong young mouse determined to keep the rats away from the Redwall abbey. I also like the adventurous storyline. It is exactly the way I like it. I think one of the best parts is when Matthias goes to find the sword of Martin the Warrior. This takes him a long time, but when he finally finds it he has to fight Asmodeus Poisonteeth, the giant adder, to get it. Another thing I like are the characters instead of people they`re animals. There are a lot other things I like to, but In the end I think this is a wonderfully fantastic book every one should read"
3,Averege,"Red wall was an okay book, it was'nt realistic toward me, the ending was good but the book started out slow. The enemies died too quickly, expecially asmodeus. Overall, Red wall was a dissappointment toward me."
5,Redwall,"Redwall is a story that will keep you saying ""just one more chapter""every time you have to do something else.this story is about a huge stone building named redwall where moles,mice,otters,hedgehogs,badgers,and squirrels.But an evil rat named clooney the scourge wants to take redwall and rule all he sees with his horde of stoats,rats,ferrets and many more different hordebeasts.Matheus,a redwall mouse,is trying to find the legendary sword of martin the warrior to help against the horde of clooney.you will be amazed at how Jacqes makes different language for different types of animals like moles.This book is a deffinite buy."
2,If'n ye wanta fie'outten wyz I don' liken thez book...,"The whole Redwall series is written with over-done cultural dialects! The story could have been greatly improved if some editor had put his/her foot down and said, ""You're teaching everyone to write junk books! We need more good books in this world! I'm rewriting it in English!""If that had happened, I would have given Redwall a much better review."
2,"Please, no more...","Terrible. The plot is just one long cliche. The peaceful ""good guys"" are attacked by the evil ""bad guys"" and rise up to defeat them. Big surprise. The characters are entirely one-dimensional. The ""good guys"" do no harm to anyone, and the ""bad guys"" are completely bloodthirsty. Jaques could at least have had a tirant for the leader of the ""good guys"" to add some diversity to the storyline. The only plus side to this book was the rich descriptions and myriad adjectives. Still... my dog could have done better than that!"
2,Audiobook Review Only!,"The book itself gets four stars, but in the audiocasseteversion I bought, Brian Jaques speaks way too fast. Read the writtenword and avoid the audiobook... END"
5,Redwall ... books of Heaven ... what's the difference?,For those who love a good story of courage you should read this book. Also you could get some laughs and maybe some tears. This isan awsome book.
5,amazing,"I thought this book was really good. At first I thought that because all of the characters were animals it wouldn't be that good of a book. But after you get into the 2nd or 3rd chapter you will find that this story couldn,t have been done with normal people. It did have a few problems but there wasnt really anything bad. Jacques has done a great job explaining all of the characters personalitys. I recomend this book to readers of all ages."
2,Poor quality materials!,"Haven't read it yet, but was VERY disappointed with the materials - small size, newsprint-type paper, for Pete's sake!!! I was looking for good quality hardcover books to build my grandchildren's library, and I wouldn't even give them this book, that's how bad it looks! For that price, I expected FAR nicer quality."
4,"Exiting plot, mind bending riddles, and unexpected tragities","Very good book with a uniqu idea. The book is a lot better if you read the rest of the series. I know because i have read and own them all up to the latest one, Marle Fox. I highly recomend this book. it displays enormous amounts of imagination and is good for allmost any age."
5,Incredible,"Redwall is a well written book, that is exciting andcapturing. At first, I was a little shaky on starting to read Redwall,but when my best friend said it was very, very good, I jumped right at it. My brother had already gotten the book, and hadn't read it, so I got it. I've read every single one now, and it only takes me a few days to finish them. If you liked this book, I suggest you should read A Wrinkle in Time, Many Waters, A Swiftly Tilting Planet, and any other book by Madeline L'Engle."
4,the amazing redwall,"The book Redwall, by Brian Jaques was very exciting. Every page was filled with adventure and action. Jacues made the story come to life. Matthias was very brave and a good main character. I liked this book because it was well written and made me wonder what was going to happen next. I liked Cluny and Matthias, the two main characters, they were enimies. Cluny was a big warrior rat and he had a giant tail. Matthias was a little, brave couragious, mouse that heard stories of redwall's hero Martin and wanted to be just like him. During the war between the people of redwall and Cluny's horde Matthias found Martin's sword and defeated the horde. I loved this book. The only bad thing was I got confused when they would switch from talking about redwall to cluny. Therefore I rate the book with a four star."
5,A Great Book,Redwall is probably the best book I've ever read. It takes you to a world of animals with the good against evil. You can just imagine the characters. Read this book.
5,The Best Adventure Series I Will Ever Know!!!!,"Being the first book of the series (although not chronologically), this book is not as good as the others in the series, but I would still give it 6 stars if I could! Brian Jacques seems to be discovering his new world for himself just as he introduces it to the reader. His books combine friendship, fun, happiness, anger, hope, and everything else into one adventure story. His talent in being able to do this without losing the reader -ever- is truly astounding!!!In this unique book, a young, somewhat awkward mouse named Matthias learns how to be a true warrior and, through riddles and mysteries, finds that he is to take the place of the legendary founder and warrior of Redwall Abbey. With the help of his friends, he pursues his true destiny."
5,"What else can I say, other then really good?","Many of my classmates have read and recomended the books in the Redwall series, so when I was bored I decided to read Redwall. I was really up at night reading it!!!The basic plot should be familiar as you read these reviews, but I have to do it. Cluny the Scourge, with his hordes of rats, attempt to take Redwall Abbey and enslave its peaceful inhabitants, as he had done with anything else in his path of destruction. Realizing their danger, the abbey dwellers among with residents of the surrounding wood, are forced to defend Redwall. Enter the unlikely hero: Matthias, novice of the abbey as he seeks the fabled sword of Martin the warrior to protect his home.I liked this book because of the plot(duh!). I also like Brian Jacque's personification of animals. If you read other books in this series you can also associate the other books' events with the first one. I think I'm speeding the 1,000 word limit so..."
5,The best fantasy book I've ever read.,"A wonderful fantasy!I loved this book and I'm glad many others have.A terrific animal adventure that combines suspense,action and a little bit of humor.The story starts in the wood of Mossflower,in the Redwall Abbey,populated by mice,in the summer of the Late Rose, and Savage Cluny and his army of ruthless vermin Warriors attacking the woodland creatures. Young Matthias goes on a quest to prove himself a warrior and to defend the Abbey. Engaging, a page turner, with great characterizations and plot, original,all you can look for in a fantasy book. Brian Jacques has crafted a tale that will appeal to all ages. James L., age 9."
5,It changes your view on mice & other small animals.,"I really love this book. It needs at least five stars! I've read it two or three times, and each time I fall right into the plot and feel like I can't put it down! After I had just started reading it for the first time, I forgot I was reading about mice and thought of them as humans. You will love this book and the others in the series. I strongly recommend this series for fantasy lovers everywhere!"
5,Red Wall Review,I loved this book. I personally think you should read it. The book I am talking about isRed Wall!The main character is a Red Wall apprentice named Matthias. He was taking a few friends home when he saw that evil rat Cluny the Scourge. He went back to Red Wall and told Father Abbot. When war broke out between Cluny and Red Wall Matthias's adventure begins. When Cluny steals Martin's tapestry one of Matthias's friends finds a ancient message addressed to Matthias. When Matthias finds the ancient tomb of Martin he finds a sword belt and a scabbard and a shield. He also find clues to find Martin's ancient sword!Does he find it? Is it there or not? Will he defeat the mighty Cluny the Scourge. Read Red Wall by Brian Jacques
3,Quite good and charming like The Tides of Avarice.,The Tides of Avarice is the born follower after the Redwall series. It's a bit different and quite violent but with great morals.
4,An Original Piece of Literature,"The tale of a struggle between good and evil, we have all read some book about that. Yet Redwall delivers this battle with a great fairy tale like sense. The story is heart warming and although a little odd at first you couldn't imagine Redwall without its characters being animals. This book is worth the read just for the originality and its feel good plot, not to mention Jacques talent for writing an excellent book."
5,Absolutley the best series ever!,"If you like fanatsy then your sure to the love the Redwall series. It says ages 9-11, but let me tell you their still good at 16 and up. As for chronological order, here is how I've got mine: ""Martin the Warrior"", ""Mossflower"", ""Mariel of Redwall"", ""The Bell Maker"", ""Salamandastron"", ""Redwall"", ""Mattimeo"", ""The Outcast of Redwall"", ""The Pearls of Lutra"". I have yet to read ""The Long Patrol""."
4,"Redwall is in all, a great book.","Redwall is a great book in all, except for the annoyance of how slowly the story goes on. The young Redwall mouse, Matthias is trying to find a legandary sword, but how very slowly he puts the facts together and goes on. Also occuring is ""the great war of Redwall Abbey."" A large band of rats, stoats, and ferrets, along with other misc. animals are trying to conquer Redwall for themselves. This band is led by a power-hungry leader known as Cluny the Scourge. This long, twisting story is most intriguing. It is the perfect medivel fantasy for anyone who loves a great book.--Josh Lang"
5,A Furry Adventure,"This book is an interesting story about a young mouse [Matthias] defending his home [Redwall Abbey] against a hoard of rats who want to capture Redwall. Matthias must solve mysterious riddles, battle many rats, befriend allies, and uncover the legendary sword of Martin the Warrior. Will he be able to drive the evil rats out of Mossflower? Buy the book to find out."
5,Read this aloud to your kids!,"My ten year old son has read every Brian Jacques book that has been published to date. Over a year ago, when he was nine, we began reading Martin the Warrior aloud in our family. About a quarter of the way into the book he couldn't stand the suspense any longer, so he picked it up and finished it on his own. Before that he had never read a book over 100 pages on his own.We went on to read several other Redwall series books aloud in our home.Please take the time to read this book to your children (boys, especially, tend to love this series starting at age 8 or 9). Brian Jacques is a superb writer and uses beautiful descriptive language in all of his books. The feasts he describes are mouth-watering!"
5,Terrific book!,"I was a little skeptical about reading this book at first. I thought a bunch of rodents fighting against each other would be a bit boring. I kept this book for a long time before I finally got around to reading it. Boy was I happy I did!It is a story about a mouse named Matthias. He is a bit clumsy and awkward. He lives a Redwall Abbey and everything there is quiet, happy and peaceful. That is until word of Cluny the Scourge and he army were coming to Redwall. He is an evil, villianous rat who is set on destoroying everything in his way and taking control over the abbey. Matthias steps up and becomes the warrior the abbey needs in order to protect themselves. But first they need to find Martin the Warrior's sword. Can they find it in time to save everyone from the clutches of Cluny and his army?*A note to young readers & their parents: this book does have a good amount of violence and deaths. Please consider whether your child will be able to handle this kind of content."
5,Suspenseful Book!,I loved the book from begging to end and would recomend it for ages 10+ (I'm 11 years old)
5,This book ranks among Star Wars ( and i am a BIG fan of it),"Well first and foremost this book shows of brain Jacques pure genius with the hriddles and the problem solving and the foreshadowing,my goodness that was the best example of fore shadowing i have ever seen. Alson the way he leads up to everything by the actions of people. That is wonderful and as i said pure genius. i just cant get over this book i nd i am sure you wont either when you read it!!!!"
