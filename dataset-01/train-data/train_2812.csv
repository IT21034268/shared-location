5,Great book. Must read.,This book covers the subject of the need to save in order to prosper better than any i have read
3,It was okay...,It had a lot of common sense advice. If you are a Christian and are aware of tithing and offering this is mostly review.
3,Not really a murder mystery,"Not a murder mystery (one death occurred 16 years before the story opens, another over 100 pages into it), but an interesting book anyway, more concerned with the interrelationships of an aristocratic family fallen on lean times. Keeps your interest because the characters don't act in expected ways all the time."
3,A solid collection of piano blues licks for Blues Scholars,"This album was recorded in London at the end of a European tour in which Memphis Slim performed these ""blues roots"" songs live. As such, it is an interesting exploration of the evolving piano styles during the blues migration from the Mississippi Delta to Sweet Home Chicago and a great resource for traditional piano blues licks. Slim's singing, however, lacks energy. I did not jump to my feet once while listing to this album. All Kinds Of Blues is a much better showcase of Memphis Slim's solo piano talents from the same period."
5,Word World Rules!,"My daughter is 2 years old and LOVES, LOVES, LOVES Word World. She mimics the letters, sounds and words. She finds it very entertaining and mama finds it very educational. Couldn't have asked for more. Highly recommended."
2,Sensor does not go beyond 25 feet,"It is working. However, the light does not turn on until the object is within 25 feet."
3,Check before you order...,"If you're mounting this in a square or octagonal-style box that's typically used for light fixtures, you should have no problem. However, if you have a single outlet/switch-style box mounted horizontally, which is commonly used on brick homes, this light will not work. In that case, I suggest you go with the Heath-Zenith line, which has mounting plates that will work with the smaller boxes."
3,He is his own man,"Ross Tompkins sure knows his music and the man could play beautifully. Younger Than Springtime is great, from Rogers and Hammerstein South Pacific. Who could write more beautiful songs, like Everytime We Say Goodbye, than Cole Porter. Through Tompkins' nuanced playing I saw minute details of his interpretation of the music. In spite of the performance, I wasn't moved emotionally. I sensed a melancholy that life was in the past and not simultaneously fresh as a newly blossomed rose. A piano guy like Bill Evans is one who is able to bring the timelessness of such beautiful music home to me."
5,"Unusual, intelligent, emotional","A lovely book that does a satisfying job of blurring the lines between memoir, journalism, and quirky meditation. Expresses the ineluctable emotion we all feel for our cars, past and present that we sometimes mistake for materialism."
3,Metrical Poetry,"Mary Oliver says her poetry and all poetry is based in metrics. I don't agree, but this is a good handbook, if you lean in that direction. I suggest reading Denise Levertov's, The Poet in the World, for an alternative take on ""organic poetry."""
3,Not much new here for an old English teacher,"It is a really fine book for someone wanting to understand metrical verse, and Mary Oliver is a superb writer."
1,I would choose a better game than this to buy.,"This board game is lame. The kids 6, 10, and 13 were bored straight. It wasn't accurate. kids kept pulling the planchette to make dirty words. Not a fun game for any age, I was just incredibly bored with it. Don't buy this waste of paper and plastic. P.S. the board burns good."
1,Have Very Beautiful Peace and Get into Christianity-plain and simple,"I do hope this gets published but i did some research on the person who created this and he is a regular person, but he is being assited by The Devil himself in order to put out this game on the market. The Devil is also the creator of this game even though this person thinks he is the one who created it. Whatever you do, get away from this. It is just like the Ouija. Cryptique is just Quija plain and simple. I recommend, in good faith, that one get a Bible ESV and follow Christianity instead, Follow God instead. He is the true Light."
5,Mystical,"This ""game"" shows you a whole world of the living and the dead. It can talk to long lost relatives and tell you what somebody is thinking. It is so great. Five Stars across the board!"
2,CRYPTIQUE BOARD GAME,"I PREFER THE ORIGINAL QUIJA BOARD. JUST THINK HOW LONG AGO THE ORIGINAL WAS CREATED AND THE HISTORY AND STORIES WHICH GO ALONG WITH IT.CRYPTIQUE DID NOT WORK WITH/FOR ME! MAYBE THE SPIRITS WERE OUT TO LUNCH?QUIJA BOARD DID WORK VERY WELL FOR ME, AND HAS PROVEN ITS ACCURACY!"
5,"Ah, Cryptique...","Ah, Cryptique... To quote ""Penn & Teller's Bulls**t"", it's the perfect blend of death and the mall. I recommend buying the P&T:BS DVD on Amazon. This magickal item is featured prominently."
1,Junk,"First off, this isn't a toy for kids. Period. I've never considered an easy accessible device that can contact spirits should be sold as a children's toy. However this is not the reason I'm giving it such a bad review. A friend of mine kept this at my house after buying it, and out of curiosity I tried it out. What a cheap piece of junk.1) The way the letters are positioned are confusing and get extremely annoying very quickly.2) The fun little letter that comes in the box about the 'salem witches', how embarrassing to real witches. None of it is true, and seems like a cheap marketing ploy.3) Did I mention cheap? The moving tool that runs over the letters scratches the bored with a matter of moments, the bored is extremely rough and makes that chalk bored noise in some spots.Over all a large piece of junk."
5,Captain Howdy Moved...,"I used to use another popular board game to talk to my good friend, Captain Howdy. He told me that, these days, choosy spirits choose Cryptique and that if I wanted to keep up our platonic relationship, I would need to change my long distance service, so to speak. So, now I'm using Cryptique! The line is crystal clear and my old friend couldn't be happier that I've tapped into this new network. I used to be one of those teens who lived on the phone. My parents are just overjoyed that their line is freed up and my conversations don't make much noise!"
5,What Lies on The Other Side?,"Love the board....it's definately Salem - and an outlet for those poor souls who were put to......well you know the history. They need to set the record straight - perhaps this is the channel where the truth will finally come to pass. Contact! This board is a breath of fresh air compared to that ""other"" board we all know. The design is beautiful, giving an effect that draws one in - description has great imagination - sent shivers down my spine. The ""spirit"" really does move me. Thanks to all for such an astonishing creation!"
1,rip off,The PlastiDip I ordered was overpriced and appeared to be half used. I paid for new! The can was almost 1/2 empty when it arrived. It did not cover well which was the selling point -- a rubber coating. It turned out to be useless. Delivery was slow and I feel my money was wasted! I will never use Plastic Craft company again.
2,WTF??? RED?!?!?!?,"I can't say I've used this product yet, but it arrived red. RED? No where did the product description say red. Now that I think of it, it doesnt' say white or black, either, So, how does one select a certain color?Completely frustrating."
2,Not Sweet or Chocolatey at all...,"I eat pretty healthy and I'm always looking for new healthy snacks, especially sweet ones!! But this purchase was a real disappointment. The quality and quantity were fine, but the taste was totally lacking. If you've ever had ""Dr. Fuhrman's Date Nut Pop'ems"" this product is nothing like those. I would say the primary taste is ""ground flax seed"", not a bad taste, kind of mild, but certainly doesn't satisfy a sweet tooth."
2,"Betty Lou's Nut Butter Balls, Chocolate Walnut",I did not like Betty Lou's Chocolate Walnut Nut Butter Balls as much as I had hoped I would like them. The flavor is not on the sweet side at all. I will eat them because do not want them to go to waste. I will just have to remember that they do contain healthy nutrients.I put one in my organic apple-cinnamon cereal yesterday hoping that the cereal would sweeten them up a bit. I think I expected they would taste more like a granola bar but they did not.
1,It says big sexy hair on the outside,"I can't prove it but it seems this product might be generic shampoo in a ""Big Sexy Hair"" bottle. We have bought this shampoo before from Costco and the texture and color of the shampoo is different than the one I bought here. I'm going to buy another bottle from someplace else and compare.Also we noted that there was no seal on the bottle when we opened it, further reinforcing our belief this product is fake."
5,Awesome product,My whole family loves this.Since we have a house full of all girls....It keeps your hair feeling really soft. Thanks
3,"Good, but not the best!","Volumizes, as promised. But it really dries out my hair and doesnt give it a good, soft clean feeling. This is my first time using big sexy hair, but i think id much rather stick to garnier fructis volumizing shampoo. The smell of this is not as pleasant, its really strong. and im not that satisfied with this purchase. Its not exactly comparable to other shampoos out there."
5,Works Very Well!,"This stuff works very well. I have many small antique and other valuable items that are on tables and shelves. They are items that if tipped over or if they somehow fall over, would probably be damaged or ruined. This gel is clear, and it is tacky and it will hold an object securely onto any surface I have tried (wood and glass) so I am not feaful that the item might fall over or be easily knocked over. The fact that it is clear is also a plus, because other similar prodicts are white or colored. For collectors or to use for other uses (such as securing a bedside telephone base to your nightstand) it works great!"
5,Awesome stuff!,"I bought a glass beverage jar for my sideboard and was concerned about keeping it secure. I read about this product in an article about the AFCS Coach's Trophy (crystal football) and figured it the product worked for it, then it should work for my jar. And it did! The instructions are easy to follow and the gel works perfectly!I recommend it for anyone who wants to protect their crystal or glass ware."
3,"Useful for some things, not quite what I was expecting.","I was expecting this to be more solid, like putty. I think they make another product called museum putty which is probably what I should have gotten. This is a clear gel that is really a very slow moving liquid. You pinch out a little lump and put it on a surface, and over time it flattens itself out into a disc. It is good for sticking flat-bottomed items to completely horizontal surfaces, and it does seem to come off of surfaces cleanly. The product info does imply it might stain unfinished wood."
3,Museum Gel,"Product as advertised but the ad does not say that it is best used on glass shelves, not on wood. I needed it for the latter so I haven't used it."
2,Does not stick well,"Does not work for small pieces - like crystal glasses, or figurines. It just doesn't stick. It does work for larger objects - my Royal Albert teapot, but I had to use a large amount of it and even then, I'm not sure that it will just dehydrate and give way in the future."
3,slow drying,The gel was very slow to dry. The surface slanting slightly so the object kept sliding off. If the gell dried faster then the object would stick to the surface.
3,Gets runny,"Purchased this to hold a delicate starfish shell upright in a nook in my bathroom. It tends to ""melt"" or run when placed on top of object to affix to wall. Works fine on the base, not good on vertical adhesion."
2,Product disappointment!,This product definitely will NOT hold a fly fishing hook for display. I don't know how a museum would ever trust in this product. I was VERY disappointed!
5,Best there is!,"I stumbled on this product years ago and tried it. It is fabulous and works much better than that white or turquoise putty you can get at supermarkets. I've used it to stick down stone and metal art objects, glassware, cardboard, paper, and this year I even stuck a Halloween Gargoyle to a large flat rock in my yard so it wouldn't blow over; the gargoyle held on through wind and rain. The gel liquifies when you use it, creating a quick bond. Don't glob it on, use small dots in multiple places and then press firmly. I've used it on my wood mantle (which is varnished) with no staining. Yes, it is not perfect - lightweight paper will slide from an upright position and a very porus surface doesn't hold as well - but hey, it does a 99.5% job and works great - you won't find anything else out there that works as well. (Plus, you can reuse the gel if it is relatively clean!)"
5,Excellent Product,I saw an idea on TV to make a holiday centerpiece by turning over a candle holder and then put a vase or other glass piece on top and then fill with Christmas balls. I used this gel to hold the two pieces together and it looks great!
2,Just another gel,The gel did not hold a ball in place -- it melted and the ball rolled off the shelf
1,Worthless,"Hold seems to be created solely by surface tension -- very easy to break. Won't work on vertical/slanted surfaces, since it runs. Double-stick tape works better than this stuff."
1,Cannot Use,"I am not able to use this gel because I wanted to use it on a piece of wooden furniture under several pieces of LLadro. The instructions say only under and on impenetrable objects. Oh well, live an d learn. I do wish Amazon would specify this. Unless they did and I missed it."
1,horrible slime,"Purchased this product to keep pictures hanging straight on the walls. Just a small pea size amount in each bottom corner. After a few days, the stuff turned into oozing slime running down the walls."
5,Interesting approach to go,"A very interesting view of Go, with insights from a programmer's point of view. Well worth reading. I found that their descriptions of the basis of strategy in a game easy to remember and apply. Will increase your insight and strength."
1,Junk,"I came across this same rail while shopping, it is junk, i know of two people who tried this product and had the same result. It simply put,does not work, and there is nothing you can do to fix it. Don't waste your money."
1,junk,"I bought this light mover and can't beleve that it won't even move my batwing 400w HPS light withought slamming my light when it get's stuck and break's free, if you can aford the new bulb every day then buy two. lol realy go better and don't look back. peace out!!!"
2,Not as Flat as Expected,"Read the product description carefully. It is as described but the photo makes it look thin. It is not. I thought I was buying a TV I could mount on my wall but it is 21"" thick with a tube sticking out the back that precludes wall mounting. I can't fault the seller but I should have considered what he was saying instead of relying on the picture."
1,No battery or manual - could not use the camera refund sent,No battery or manual - could not use the camera refund sent. appeared to be a used camera - box was messed up and the camera battery and manual was missing. I shipped it back and received a refund. Was not able to use the camera.
1,Do not purchase!!! Does not deserve even one star!!,"I purchased this video in the hope of educating a tour group about Mexico. It is AWFUL. The tour guide agreed with me and would not show it. It is basically a string of home video clips with boring, overly general statements dubbed on top. Don't be as gullible as I was--this is a waste of money!!!!"
5,Cool,this is my favorite barriki he reminds me of a mantis with he`s claws. love his glow in the dark pieces squid lanchar is kind of frustrating though.
5,The best product,I am very happy with the Mustela Hydra Bebe Body. After every use my son smells like a daisy! I realy recommend this product for babies and toddlers.
4,What they didn't mention in school,"This book provides considerable information most of us were not previously exposed to. The conclusions are rational in light of the author's interpretations and assumptions. Altogether a good read that makes one think, whether a beliver in religion or agnostic.The best part of reading this book is that new views of the past become almost inevitable."
5,Awesome translator,"For an electronic sentence translator this is the best I have ever seen. I visited China twice and this was a lifesaver. It allowed communication back and forth with relative ease. The person I was with could write in Chinese and I could either type or write in English and it would translate the sentence. It has limitations, but they are not bad. When names of people or places are written in Chinese they are translated to their meaning. e.g. The woman I was with was named ""Chunxia"" which translates to ""rosy clouds in the Springtime"". So if she wrote her name it became translated. Guangzhou was ""wide thirty"" and so on. It gives the spelling of words written in Chinese (Mandarin) or Pinyin. It will operate in either Chinese or English. I doubt you will find a better sentence translator, especially at this price."
1,I need an English-Chinese Dictionary,"I ordered this dictionary because I need both traditional and simplified Chinese characters along with the pinyin. The instruction book doesn't give me information on how to get to both types of characters, nor does the instruction book tell me how to get the pinyin for each character. I believe this dictionary is made for people wanting to learn English. Why does this dictionary come with four DVDs? Some of the buttons on the key board are in Chinese. The cost of this dictionary is about $400.00, and the aggravation you can get is worth much more. The English definitions come with English errors in grammar and spelling. Not helpful and a big disappointment. CD 628 . . . bu hao!"
4,preatty damn good,I baughta mp3 player but did not want to pay a whole lot of cash. And this one made the cut. This playyer is great for working out because it is very light weighing about an ounce. The menu is easy to navigate and you can simply drag and drop files on your computer to the player. If your are going to buy this make sure you get yourself a better pair of headphones because the ones you get are very short and attached to a wierd neck strap. Overall this is a very good player and will hold about 175 songs.IT'S PREATTY DAMN GOOD!!!!!!!!
4,This old lady likes it,"I'm on my second winter with this humidifier and find it in many ways superior to others we have owned in our 43 years together, living in many different parts of the country.Yes, you can clean it and store it dry offseason; the last one before this I never could get totally dry.Yes, it's a nuisance having to plug it in and unplug it, and pay attention to the reservoir level when out of the room.My biggest problem is that I've been looking for a supply of replacement filters, and I'm too sick to go shopping in stores and trying to tell others what I want...So here I am online looking for replacement filters. What a drag!"
1,don't buy this product!!!,"We bought this humidifier as the low-cost alternative when our kids were sick this week. It's horrible! We're returning it today! When this unit is running, it leaks water between the reservoir and motor units. Overnight it leaked enough water to completely saturate a folded up large bath towel I placed under it! Two days later & the towel is still wet! Additionally, the unit is noisy, spits out water droplets with the mist, and is very difficult to clean (oddly shaped water reservoir makes it impossible to completely empty the unit). If you need a humidifier, buy a different product!"
1,LEAKS!!,"I received this as a gift, and it leaks all over the towel we had underneath it and the carpet. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
1,Bad product,I'm really upset with this item. I registered for it and when I got it the thing didn't work. I called the 800 number trying to see if I did everything right but couldn't get a live person on the phone. I went and exchange the item and the second one didn't work. Horrible Horrible product and business.
1,Very dissatisfied,"I have a terrible problem with the Vicks Healthmist Humidifier that I purchased from Target. I bought it soon after my first child was born Nov 2002, and ever since then it has been a tremendous effort to keep mildew from forming both in and out of the unit. I clean out the tub and refill it with water each night, wipe down the inside and outside of the vent and mold/mildew still grows in it overnight! This causes more harm than good to try and help my baby breathe better. Finally frustrated with the entire process, my husband and I took the screws out of the top unit to remove ALL pieces to find a disturbing amount of mold/mildew in the plastic pieces attached to the motor!!! Once we put it back together, it now makes a loud noise as the plastic piece spins around. Entirely TOO much work to use a humidifier and to still not be able to keep it clean."
2,Leaks Water!!!,I bought this because I thought Vicks was a good brand. WRONG...it leaks water everywhere. I had it filled way below the maximum and it still leaked. I'm returning it!!!
1,Too Loud,"I purchased this product for use in the nursery. It makes a terrible vibration that is very loud. After buying the first unit, it stopped working after about a month. I had emptied the water and let it dry out everyday and cleaned it weekly. The company let me return it with no receipt, so that was no hassle. I believe that they sent me a reconditioned unit which was extremely LOUD with this horrible vibration. We tried everything to get it to stop. It made both me, my son and my husband very grouchy! Finally, it stopped working the other day. I am fed up with it and am throwing it in the trash, Finally!"
1,"I'm not a moron, but....","I'm not a moron, but this product still didn't work for me (see note re: 'moron' in other review). I had difficulty getting any mist at all from the thing and had alot of sediment to clean out every morning (and I followed all of the instructions!). The instructions explain that output could vary due to type of water used. I tried tap (we have hard water) and bottled and still got poor results. a lot of work getting the salt level right, and still no good mist. I'm looking for another machine."
4,works fine for our baby,"simple, cheap. we use white noise to help our baby sleep, so the noise level is fine. humidity is not excessive so the walls stay dry. i wish it had an on/off switch instead of having to unplug it every morning."
1,SUCKS!!!!,"We bought one of these for our nb about 2 weeks ago,and it does not work we put salt in it and cleanded it we accually bought 2 and both stopped workingso dont waist your money!!!"
2,Zero stars for this one!,"I bought this table because the price seemed to be right. It had been if the product would have a better quality. The craftsmanship is poor, to say the least. The product was received with scratches, the tint was uneven, the round nut to secure the legs did not hold the pin, and I had to use Elmer's wood glue to secure the legs in place. The cuts in the wood did not match the legs. Well, a complete disaster! Save your money and keep away of this ""terrific price"" sent to us from China."
4,Like it but kind of small,Very sturdy and looks great. Not as big as a regular coffee table. If you have big dogs everything gets knocked off by their tail. The second shelf is really nice to store extra things on.
4,Attractive and solid,Easy to assemble and good looking. It fits nicely into our TV room.I think their products are a good buy
1,No screws in the package and many scratches,"This has to be the worst product I bought from Amazon in years!I could not assemble as there were no screws in the package.Also, there were scratches in the lower portion. Returning this item if the seller doesn't provide screws."
4,very sturdy coffee table,pros: good quality table - it is well built and I like the colorcons: size - too small
4,I take back the stars! Zero stars for this!,"Well I thought it was a good deal when I bought them in April 2007 but these are turning out to be horrible. I bought two for a mountain cabin. BOTH now have wood that's splitting, the top is separating from the edge moulding, and one literally has a split that I can fit 3 credit cards in! These are terrible! They obviously didn't kiln dry the wood used to make them, the finish is even worse with the splits because the wood is almost whitish and no amount of touchup is gonna fix a crack I can see thru. Plus, I wrote the original review based on the first one prior to opening the second. They sent the wrong legs on the second one...I had to drill out holes to jerry-rig it.Don't waste your money.These are junk!From original April review:These put together very easy and fast. The finish could have been better, especially in the edges between the flat top and top edge moulding. But for the price...eh...it's a good deal. Looks good."
2,Not great,"I thought this would be a good coffee table for my new apartment, and it was fine at first...but I've had it for over a year now and it's become wobbly with regular use. Also, I spilled some water on it once and didn't realize it, and the ""finish"" started peeling off! It looks so horrible now that I cover it with coffee table books so you can't see the peeling finish. If I weren't moving soon I'd replace it right away, but I'm going to wait until I move to my new place to get something sturdier and more water-resistant!The only plus I can give it is the shelf is very useful and the color is nice."
3,"Looks nice, but not very sturdy",This table looks nice but the way it is put together leaves room for it to wobble and come apart. For the price I thought it would be more durable. I would spend a little more and get a better quality product.
2,poorly made,"This is a poorly made product which looks nice in pictures but isn't as nice once put together. The ""wood"" is cheap (even by cheap pressed-wood standards!). The ""finish"" is inconsistent, there are cracks in it and the table stains easily. The legs never fit together in a flush way... there's always a gap on one side and when I push those legs together, then there's a gap on the other side. A very poorly made product, which is unfortunate, considering that Winsome comes up with great designs."
1,Crappy table!,We've owned this table now for a little over a year and it is terrible! When we first purchased it one of the legs would not secure completely but we thought no big deal since we don't move it much. Well even from it just sitting there and our dog occasionally bumping it when hes scratching the leg almost falls off. It has chips all along the edges. For $85 I expected something a little nicer than this. We did move across the country and this table barely made it even though it was packed in tight with the rest of our stuff. Very disappointed.
3,"Nice size, mediocre quality.",The table is a nice small size that we were looking for. It was easy to assemble and fits wellwith our other furnishings. The finish on the table seems adequate. There is a flaw on one edgewhere an indent was caused when the top was formed. It wasn't severe enough to take the effort tosend it back. For the price it was a worthwhile purchase.
5,"Hey, guys, I like it!","A lot of other reviewers have dissed this album. Sorry, but I strongly disagree. This was the first Samples album I ever bought (though I had heard the band before on an obscure show on PBS) and I dug it from the start. Ok, maybe its not as deep as ""The Last Drag"" (my other favorite) or some of the other albums, but don't hold that against it. Some of the songs have appeared on other earlier albums, but that's ok too-- these versions are different. And that's not a bad thing. Overall it probably rocks a bit harder than some of the others, and while not a requirement, that's not bad either. The live hidden bonus cut ""When It's Raining"" (originally from ""No Room"") is alone worth the purchase price. In my opinion, a very fine album from an excellent and underappreciated band."
1,Garbage!,The fact that they call this thing the wind blaster is like a joke. This is one of the weakest fans I have ever bought. This fan should cost no more than five bucks. I went to Target and got a decent floor fan for about 18 dollars that had 10 times the power of this little wimp. Waste of money.
3,Ho Hum,Fans came in a timely manner....while they move air.. there was no strength behind the blades...size is small and convenient...glad I didn't pay too much for them because it was a bit of a disappointment.
3,"It is quite, but invest in a battery company to operate it","I bought this product, because for the price it seems to be a very cost effective battery operated fan. I discovered after opening it that it requires 8 D size batteries to operate. Good news is it does come with a ac adapter. So I don't have to invest in a battery company in order to use it - just an extension cord. It is very quite and does put out a good amount of air. But the switch to go from low to high speed broke the first time trying to use it. Product is Made in China. So it only has 1 setting now, low. Not sure how long it will last, especially on batteries. It's an okay product. I've purchased better, but also worse. Good luck."
5,Much more than a book just about Sexual Sin,"I am so pleased to recommend this book. You are well advised to purchase a copy. Throughout the book, Ted Roberts DOES talk about sexual temptations and sin. For this, I was very grateful, as I needed a resource to help me with my counselling, that was comprehensive, Biblical, and practical. However, best of all, this book is for people who have ""have repented innumerable times and tried with everything they have to follow Christ,"" and ""have tried to remedy the situation by being more determined and spiritual, but it didn't work,"" (p. 26,27). Sound familiar?"
5,Difference between Marketing and Sales,"Book started out great... until page 2. Paragraph 'Difference between Marketing and Sales': ""Marketing is different from Sales in that you first determine the customer's needs and then design a product or service to satisfy those needs.. Marketing is really about listening to your customer. In a sales-oriented organization, salespeople listen with the intent to reply; in marketing you listen with the intent to understand.""My recommendation for a replacement definition: ""Marketing is Sales on crack - with no quota."" Get a grip - nothing happens without a sale and you're not going to get one of those without listening."
4,loved it!,"This yoga video is great if you want a nice, calming set of stretching and breathing exercises. I'm 30 weeks pregnant and just started it. It allowed me to breathe easier, and I really appreciated the fact that it was nice and slow. It's definitely more relaxation than exercise, but at 30 weeks pregnant and in decent shape, I didn't need something to kick my butt. It's the only workout DVD that I've ever bought that I was excited about when it was over. I really can't wait to do it again. Her voice is soothing, but if you require lots of great camera work and scenery, you'll be disappointed. I'm not sure why anyone needs high quality video while working out, but...I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could, only because there is one part (about a couple minutes) where she moves from pose to pose too fast for me. Other than that, I think it's great if you just want to unwind and feel better!"
3,Little too gentle,"This video was a little weird. I guess I wanted something a little more movement, little less meditation. I did the workout quite a few times but just didn't feel that I got much out of it."
1,"Could've been better, but will work","I ordered the Prenatal Yoga video since I started a prenatal yoga class and enjoy it a lot. Yet there are times I am unable to get to the class and would like to do it at home. This video to me was much more boring than I expected. It does yoga moves that I like, but the background wooded area was sooo dull to me. It looked dead and the in b/w scenes were just as bad. I don't know, it just wasn't a great prenatal yoga video to me. It's just doable if I need it."
3,Very Low Impact Workout,"I was a little disappointed with this yoga DVD because it is SO low impact. I think it is probably good for someone that is about nine months pregnant and can barely move. I am 8 months pregnant (32 weeks) and can still do the power yoga, so this was not a challenge for me at all. If you are wanting something that will relax you and take minimal effort, this is the DVD for you."
5,excellent meter for the price.,"This item was purchased as a replacement for a much older meter. It is compact and very reliable. The temperature probe is especially helpful for checking the operation of our hot water solar system. Accuracy appears very good in all ranges and settings. Case and cover are comfortable and rugged. It has a built-in stand for tipping up the meter for better reading. Seems a little flimsy, but o.k. so far."
4,The Bomb,"I bought the first cd and it was good. This new one is the bomb. I wish I can find you in concert. I highly recommend this one . It has all types of styles. I love the way he remix Baby I love You. You got the right mixture in this cd, slow, fast , medium, love,hate song.And I paid attention to the words like ya say David and yeah it's all about me. Thank you I wish you much success ...."
5,Granny4Girls,"The tiger was purchased as a Christmas gift and adds to a more ""wild"" stuffed animal collection. My granddaughters love to gather their Webkinz and play house and have shows. You can't go wrong with the quality of their products."
3,"Cute idea but the toys are ""cheap""","Though the idea and web-tie ins are cute, kids enjoy them, etc. the toys themselves seem ""cheap""--tiger is a little mangy looking. They could put a little more effort into the actual plush toy, y'know? Disappointing."
5,Delighted!,"My daughter got her first Webkinz in Yellowstone. The elephant was lost when we moved home so she requested a replacement for Christmas. I was able to buy her one and saw this one as well so I bought him as a ""Mike"" for LSU. She loves him and is now collecting Webkinz. Very happy child."
5,SO great!!,"My son REALLY wanted a Tiger Webkinz for Christmas, and when he found this one in his stocking - he was SO excited!!! He LOVES it!!!!!!!!"
2,totally unplugged,"(...) I am sending both of mine back for a refund. I got these to get rid of the cords however the delay that the controllers have makes gaming impossible for certain games. While they may work on some games (...) having to change back to regular controllers is not worth the hassell. I even called MadCatz they were very polite and professional though they did admit the Metal gear solid 2 was unplayable with them. We love to play Frequency and the controller delay makes the expert levels impossible to compensate for. MadCatz say they are working on the problems, apprently they forgot to test the controllers on more than one game. Until they can or will ever be able to fix these issues I am using the stadard controllers"
5,Perfect Multi-play!,"I bought the two at TARGET store, and playing with my kids withNML, NBA games everyday. Working perfect and fun to play."
2,[stupid],"My husband and I just bought 2 of these controllers from Target 2 days ago. We also told the Target employee that they will see a ton more of these returned right after Christmas! We actually returned them today, and bought the Logitech wire less controllers (which are much nicer)!Serious delays in movement. And sometimes you push the control pad or stick in one direction, and it goes in the opposite direction. Overall bad design. I can probably make a wireless controller that works better than this one.Go for the logitech ones! It's the best I've seen so far."
3,Average Controller,"I like the idea of wireless, but I've noticed some serious delays in response on certain games. If you need a controller for a game that requires quick action or accurate action, stick with one that connects to the system. This one is okay for other games."
1,Don't work,"Bought two of these last year. Great idea if they worked. Called MadCatz, terrible support. On hold forever. They sent me two refurbished ones to replace them.they didn't work either.Called back & spent another seemed like forever on hold. They sent me two more. They didn't work either. So for $$$ I now have six controllers that don't work.I mean they don't work at all,lights come on ,thier charged,they just don't work. Got disgusted and stopped calling."
2,do not buy,"this controller would not be all bad if it were not for all the lag in controls. If you are playing a game that needs any kind of precision control it will not work. not good, not good."
3,"Works great on some games, putredly poor on others","On some games (Simpsons Road Rage), I couldn't even get the game to recognize that a controller was plugged in. Of course, this turns into a real buzz kill when you have friends over to play, and you only own 1 other wired controller."
1,This controller stinks,"I bought it when it was new, it is a great idea (I own a logitech wireless controller now), but this controller is the equivalent of playing every game with a couple second delay. If you are playing any type of game that requires quick reflexes (madden or any other sports game, any first-person shooter) you might as well give up. You're gonna lose"
1,Problem with Remote,It seems to freeze up when you are using the left control stick. I contacted Mad Catz and they admit to a problem but don't have a fix. Save your money until the fix it.
1,The worst Wireless controler I have ever owned!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Short but sweet, it lags alot, you push a button to take a shot and you can actually sit back and wait to watch the shot happen. Great as far as the capablities of wireless and being a long distance away from the game unit, but how does that help if it doesn't work fast enough to keep you in the game. DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!! you've been warned. Now it is up to you to find out."
2,RIP OFF!...,"I used to have a I.R.(infa red) control pad for ps1. When I saw this I thought it would be just as responsive as the one I had. I was wrong, this thing doesn't work. The anolog sticks are not sensitive enough and if you play sports games like madden you have no accuracy at all on field goals. Don't throw your money away on this. I hope someone comes out with a good I.R. one like I used to have."
5,The 900'' Stars,''900''is the best in the world so now you don't have to be the amount to play.Now you can be longer than the amount than aever before!!!
1,NOT FOR WOOLY FANATICS,"If Wooly Wolstenholme's hauntingly beautiful keys and vocals were your favorite BJH component, forget this album. Wooly was long gone, and the remaining band members were only trying to please their record label with short unsatisfying pop dribble. I was disappointed ""John Lennon's Guitar,"" a great live tune was absolutely terrible and far shorter as a studio cut on this CD. Run, don't walk from this one! BJH is capable of good, short pop songs (try Face To Face). Not here, though. Yuck!"
5,david lee murphy,"all round good cd. loved him from the old cmt days. the freight was a bit expensive, but i'll know next time!!"
4,Loveboat -- An excellent collection of love songs,"I have no idea where some people's negative criticism of this album is coming from. I'm a die-hard Erasure fan, one who's never heard an Erasure song he didn't like. Ok, when I first bought this album I thought it was ok. But as is the case with many of their albums, it grows on you, a lot! It's deffinately a change. One can't compare this album with Wonderland, Wild, Chorus, the self-titled, etc. Erasure keeps keeping us hooked with new sounds and maturing, would we expect anything less.The lyrics on this album are absolutely fabulous. Deffinately worth reading through the jacket. For Erasure's pop enthusiasts, there are a few great tracks for you too.A truly spectacular album. The tracks Freedom, Perchance to Dream, Love is the Rage, Catch 22, and Moon & the Sky, are not to be missed! Now when are these fab. showmen going to tour here in the United States again? I can't wait for the concert!"
2,Erasure's Loveboat Running Out of Steam?,"Sorry to say a mediocre effort from the queens of synth-pop. A couple of great tracks ""Freedom"" and ""Alien"" but otherwise an Erasure album that only a fan could really appreciate. If you have to own every Erasure album (and that includes me), buy it. Otherwise look to other Erasure albums like the self-titled album, ""The Circus"" or ""Chorus."""
2,Mistaken in this purchase,"I thought this would be a bi-lingual story book. I was mistaken. It's completely in English. I will get use of it, reading to my kids. Also, we'll enjoy the old Italian fables."
2,Bad Price,"I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my niece, and the book itself looks great, but I was a little surprised when I looked at the back of the (very, very thin) book to see the suggested retail price of $1.50. I paid $3.49 for it! At first I was thinking I was sent the wrong book, but when I looked it up, I noticed the $1.99 ""outsourcing fee"", which is pretty ridiculous as it's more than the cost of the book, and it's the same with all of the other books in this series. Considering I usually get great deals and save a ton of money by getting presents through Amazon, I found this very disappointing. A good lesson on reading the fine print in the future - next time I want a Dover Children's Thrift Classic, I'll just go buy one in the store for under $2!"
3,Model needs painting,"My son is just now getting into modeling, and I am starting him off on easy ones. This one was not as easy as I'd expect. There was no prepainting done so the model is a base off-white color with no detail. The parts do not fit together as well as I'd expect either. I do appreciate the fact the model can be made with gear up or down. I'd rate this as average."
3,Gift,This is a Christmas Present for a a 9 year old child child.. So I cannot I honestly cannot give it an appropriate rating.
3,"OK, but dissapointing!","While OK, this major label debut from the Why Store lacks the intensity of its first two CD's. Don't get me wrong, this is a good batch of music, but it just didn't suck me in like `Welcome to the Why Store' and `Inside the Why Store.' You be the judge!"
4,Great color splash!,"I needed some yellow accessories to go with a fantastic blue and white dress I'd bought for my husband's graduation from UCLA (school colors are blue and gold!) and it looks just perfect with my yellow shoes and headband. One thing I might say about the belt is that the ACTUAL color falls somewhere between the colors of the two pictures (one looks way brighter than the other), so keep that in mind if looking for matching accessories."
2,Mannered Like Emily Post,"I love Milt Jackson, but find this album a little too boring. Unlike his ripping work with Monk or plumbing beauty with MJQ, this album finds him doing standards at a snail's pace. And there's less than 30 minutes of music here anyway, so you're better off looking elsewhere."
4,Misogyny for the literate,"A thinly veiled exploration of Picasso, The Man Who Painted Women is an involving investigation of misogyny which only a misogynist could write"
1,Where's the evidence ?,"23,500 US and 31,000 Commonwealth POWS kidnapped by the Russians liberating POW camps in Germany in WW2 ?Come on. All those POWs would have been known to their families as POWs of the Germans...and most would have been receiving letters & food parcels from their families & friends. So, they all disappear into the Soviet Gulag just when they should be going home and........what ? The families connive in a 'cover-up' ? The families just accept their disappearance ? The home regiments of those military men just close their eyes and mouths ?What were the POW camps where the Soviets kidnapped these thousands of Allied troops ? Who were the soldiers ? Names please.This is just another dreary, dishonest, slimey, fact-less conspiracy theory. If you think that JFK was murdered by the FBI, CIA, the MAFIA, a young George Bush or Queen Elizabeth 11 - then this book will enthrall you."
3,Not her best,"This seems weak effort from this author. The art is fine--the text is awkward and pointless, ""No, not the trash can-you want to stink? It might be okay to hide under the sink."" Not really a counting book either."
5,Can't wait to hear it!,I saw lee play guitar with Joe Diffie last new years' eve and have been following his career ever since He's a great player! I dont know why anyone would say such awful things about lees record. A friend of mine ordered lees Back with a bang record and loves it. She made me a copy its in my cd player all the time. I hope the butt song is on the new record It's my favorite i will be calling the radio station to request lee bogan songs and you should to.
4,Great tunes!,This CD is good stuff! I appreciate the many different styles of music and talent. There are several tunes that are gonna go all the way!
4,A unique glimpse on the Aloha lifestyle,"I appreciate it when a local opens their passion to offer a glimpse of life as they see it. This espouses their values and guides one's understanding of the aloha experience. If ""island fever"" is something mainlanders are concerned about, this should provide an antidote! My only suggestion would be to offer a geographical gem to the enticing cover to complement the obvious human beauty. In truth, Hawaii is more beautiful in person than the pictures portray, which is a very welcome surprise, given how wonderful the pictures can convey, establishing it in a rare class of locations.."
5,Exquisite morsels of truth marinated in real life experience,"I was a student of Jess Moody at Palm Beach Atlantic and it thrills me to see him still at it in ""Club Sandwich"". His gift to tell meaningful stories in a memorable way shines through once again. He writes the way he preaches, short, succinct, and powerful. If you need a heart- warming lift I highly recommend you read ""Club Sandwich""."
3,His Best Stuff Is His More Rcent Stuff!,"More Blues On The South Side was recorded in Chicago on December 30, 1963. The disc features the vocals and harp of a very young Billy Boy Arnold and some interesting guitar work by an equally young Mighty Joe Young. While the recording is 40 years old, I must say that the recording is remarkably clean from a technical perspective. The music contained on the disc is probably typical of that played in Chicago in the early 60's and is somewhat reminiscent of Bo Diddley or even a young Junior Wells. While there are some interesting moments on the disc, it is clear that this is a guy that got better, much better, with age."
4,Great for the OCD comic collector,"Wanted something to seperate each series in my long-boxes. I use to have some cheapo cardboard dividers, but I needed more dividers, and I wanted something a little nicer. These are made of a durable plastic and do their job well. Pair these with a label maker and your gold."
3,Comic Dividers,Great design!! Good for separating your comics if your a multi collector. To be placed in your Comic Box Storage.
2,Inexpensive you get what ya pay for,"I ordered 3 of these. They are as the other 2 star review stated.The darn things were put together backwards! They are inexpensive, well they were any way, now I think the price is to high. I took them apart and put them back together as they were supposed to be made. It did mean there was a small hole at the bottom. Normally that hole would face the wall but hey, I guess to some poor person in China it all looked ok.I am going to use them until I can find something I like that is nicer. Hey it beats the heck out of Jelly jar exterior fixtures."
2,"One Light Upward Wall Sconce, Satin Nickel #61532",This item did not match what I received. The metal is facing upward not down as in the picture. And metal was not satiny finish but metal looking.
2,Blu Tack,"I purchased Blu-Tack Re-Usable Adhesive because I had read that it worked really well as an eraser for artists (charcoal, graphite, etc.) I gave samples of it to 25 of my art students and none were impressed. It did not pick up nearly as well as the traditional putty (kneadable) erasers. Not one of my students said they would purchase it themselves.It probably works really well for its intended use as a nonabrasive adhesive, but not so much as an artist's eraser."
2,Much like a typical Kneading eraser,"I also used blu tack for drawing. I bought it with the impression that the adhesive properties would achieve finer erasures than that of a normal kneading eraser. I was wrong. I've found that this stuff isnt much too different at all. The only visible difference between the two is their color and smell. Blu tack smells a little more pleasant, but i totally dont think this benefit would validate the higher price tag. Stick to the kneading eraser."
1,Tank Girl: explosive adaptation of the hit film.,Drudgery. Uninspiring adaptation from a great writer. For collectors.
4,An introductory resource on the Enneagram,"This is a fine basic introduction to the field of Enneagram study as a tool for self-understanding and improving interactions with others. Even though I have a number of other more indepth books on the topic, I found this book to be highly accessible and very usefull in introducing friends and family to the basic understandings of Enneagram theory. I plan to purchase it as gift items in this regard.I especially liked the chapters covering the correlation of Enneagram types with those of the Meyers Briggs Type Indicator system."
3,slim and a little lightweight,"I wanted to like this book. I picked it up as a tool for exploring the chemistry between characters in my writing. I always identify their enneagrams during character development, and it seemed like this might inspire thought and lead to new depths of understanding the way they relate.Unfortunately, this volume is a bit skimpy. The section on enneagram interrelations runs from pages 9 to 157, and it only gets that much because the book has a large typeface, utilizes bullet points and lots of cartoons. I enjoyed what they have, but it feels like a teaser for a more indepth book.I'll be looking for that book."
5,Great Experience,"The book came in a timely manner, and in great condition.Besides 2 or 3 earmarks, it was perfectly new.The book itself doesn't have real thorough explanations of each number on the Enneagram, but it is helpful for evaluating relationships once you know your number.Overall, it is a good buy and arrived in great condition."
2,Not her best writing by far....,"While I thought these three stories were OK...I felt that the author has grown by leaps and bounds with her newer offerings. These stories didn't hold my attention like her current books do. ""The Right Path"" was the best of the three."
3,Old tales retold,"This anthology brings back three old stories by Ms. Roberts, THIS MAGIC MOMENT, SEARCH FOR LOVE, and THE RIGHT PATH. The writing is as compelling as ever but the stories are a bit dated and not quite as good as Roberts current works. For pure romance they work, but don't look for the edge of your seat suspense and sharp plotting of her more current novels. Perhaps the new title is what bothers me- MYSTERIOUS these stories are not."
1,1970s Formula Romance,"I read all three stories. Although it was really tough to stay with it. These are stories Nora wrote decades ago. They have a formula feel. Virgin girl meets rich man. Girl and man misunderstand each other. Man overpowers girl. Girl falls in love with man even though she doesn't like him. Yuck!I read this type of stuff in the 1970s. Not up to today's Nora's standards. That is for sure! Save your money and read some of her books from this decade. They are much, much better."
2,What's the mystery?,"The mystery is how did Nora Roberts write these books? They are not up to her normal standards. I know they are earlier works, but I have read a lot of other early works by Nora and they have not been this bad. I know that Catherine Coulter rewrites/updates some of her earlier books, then publishes them. I wish Nora would do that with some of hers. She is a great writer, but these stories are so dated. One of the stories reads like a gothic novel from the 1960's. That's OK if it was written in the '60's, but it was written in the '80's! I guess these books were Silhouette Romance ""formula"" books, so she didn't have a lot of leeway on the format?? Buyer beware!"
5,Works Great,"I love this little knife. Be aware that the blade is only about 5 inches long, but that is what I wanted. I will buy it in the larger size when it becomes available."
2,Who's Running This Funk Stand?,"This is the closest you can get to a good One Way compilation. Yet, despite its highlights, it is disappointing. It has 4 tracks which are labelled Alicia Myers, and none of those tracks sound anything like One Way. The interruption of the funk flow would not be so bad, but for the fact that the Alicia Myers tracks are awful. Particularly, the almost 8 minutes of Say, Say, Say is boring, boring, boring. There are other One Way compilation CD's, and those are sorely lacking also. What's the deal? I have 4 One way albums sitting in my closet, and from those albums, I know, beyond a doubt, that I could pick 15 songs, call it Greatest Hits, and people would say, ""Yeah, that's my One Way."" Why are this band's decision makers so darn confused?"
1,Yuck!,"Before anyone gets the wrong idea about this review,I'd like to say that One Way is a fabulous group.I think they are waaaaay underated.MCA/Universal or whoever put this garbage of a compilation together should be ashamed of themselves.One Way is in DIRE need of a worthwhile collection,and this one misses the mark big time.My guess is the industry has been overlooking One Way because their records have not been placing high on the charts or selling ""Thriller"" type numbers.What about us One Way fans that religiously bought those records? In short,where is ""Love Is"",""Guess You Didn't Know"",""Lost Inside Of You"" & ""Toast To The Other Man""?To wrap things upOne Way on a scale of 1 to 5:10This Compliation on a scale of 1 to 5:1"
3,Gimme that funk...,"I wish I had the original master tapes and the rights to re-release these classic albums myself! MCA, Universal or whoever, let me at that funk because it's real sad when the Japanese get it before we do! Even Germany have the first One Way album before Detroit! Come on, I know the head companies aren't based in America anymore, and it's all about the Platinum and the Diamonds in this industy, but this is about the classics, respectfully. I have an excellent ear and can also remaster these albums to the T, and then some. The fans want it, and that includes Me. Please, just give me ""Wild Night!"" Been cheated for too long on these doggone imports (almost 40 to 50 bucks for the ""Who's Foolin' Who?"" album... the irony of the price and the title's killin' me right now!) This compilation wasn't a thought-out venture at all. Well, let's just see if we get an anthology for Al Hudson & company One Way or another..."
4,One Way,"YES, I AM IN AGREEMENT WITH THE OTHER CUSTOMERS SEARCHING FOR THE OTHER HITS/MEMORABLE SONGS BY ONE WAY....I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING AT EVERY RECORD SHOP/STORES HERE IN HOUSTON FOR AWHILE NOW FOR THE CD ""WHO'S FOOLING WHO"" BY ONE WAY....SONGS SUCH AS: YOU, AGE AIN'T NOTHING BUT A NUMBER & WHO'S FOOLIN WHO ALONG WITH OTHER SONGS ON THAT PARTICULAR ALBUM...."
1,Universal Music can't be serious can they?,"One Way and the fans deserve better than this ....stuff.Where is ""Music"",""Lost Inside Of You"",""Guess You Didn't Know"",""Toast To The Other Man"",""Whammy"",""Love Is"" and a WHOLE bunch of other worthy tracks ? Universal didn't see fit to give these guys a ""GOLD"" entry..a thing that makes you go hmmm...Until They do,I encourage you to make your own compilation.P.S.:I'd give this disc zero stars,but according to Amazon's rating system,there's a one star minimum."
5,I Love This CD One Way,"This CD has the major hits on it, it didn't have two so I purchased those separately. No biggie because this CD is excellent even if I didn't get the other two. One Way brought me back to grade school and high school times. Love it."
1,Not the video I ask for,"I watch 10 minutes into it and had to return it, cause it wasn't the one I ask for. I wanted for my sister, she hasn't been toPuerto Rico in 20 years."
3,Third-season Man from U.N.C.L.E. silliness in print,"This rather mediocre book by Thomas Stratton reads like a third-season episode fleshed out and put into print. The plot, such as it is, concerns an invisibility device that Thrush's Milwaukee (Milwaukee?) office steals and which U.N.C.L.E., in the persons of Napoleon and Illya, has to get back. There is a rather labored running joke throughout the book about Mr. Waverly's penny-pinching ways and quite a few more ""innocents"" than you would generally expect to run into in an actual MFU episode. Get this book only if you really need it to fill out your series."
1,didn't come with everything i needed.,so apparently you need some type of additional solution for this dye to take. I am not sure what is missing? I followed the instructions but I put a white t-shirt in the water and I came out a pale washed out lime green?
5,Fat Handiwipes!!,"Hi everyone,I had been looking for the heavy duty Handi Wipes for some time. I last bought some in a local supermarket in Astoria, Queens NY, but hadn't been able to find them since I moved to Western Massachusetts. I had used and reused them multiple times, washing them in the washing machine over and over again until they finally fell apart. I'm not kidding....they lasted for at least 7 years. They are a great product...much easier and more effective to use than the regular Handi Wipes which I find to be too thin and lack absorbancy. I was very excited to find that they were still available and available online...It sounds silly to say that I was excited, and my wife thinks I'm nuts, but when you find something that really works better than any other similar product....that's exciting!!!Anyway, I highly recommend these terrific cleaning wipes....Handi Wipes, Heavy Duty!!!Peter"
5,A happy friend,"A friend of mine swears by these, and has been having a cousin from another state keep her supplied, because she cannot find them locally. I happened to come across these and ordered a box, I kept a few packages and sent her the rest. I really do like using these because they last even through a washing and most important is they do the job and dry quickly. My friend and myself will be ordering more in the future."
2,Don't buy 2 of these!,"Don't buy 2 of these! The 2 we got operate on the same frequency with no option to change the frequency. So when our 2 kids try to play with their cars at the same time, each controller operates both cars and fights ensue! If you want your kids to get mad at each other and drive you nuts, buy 2 of these cars."
5,Remote 4x4 truck,"We bought this for my son who is 4 and never had a remote truck before. We weren't sure if he would be too old for this one, but we were wrong. Its perfect for his age! Easy to control and very durable. Even my 1 year likes to push buttons and drag it around. It seems to hold up to the banging around. Batteries die quickly it only uses 'AA"" but works out in the dirt too."
1,Do not Buy,This toy lasted about 45 minutes Christmas morning. My son was so excited to use it in water that he filled the bathtub just a small amount and tried to roll it across the tub floor. It has not worked since. Does not work in water!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,We love this car!,"This was a 5th birthday present and seems to work great. It's bumped around and has gone easily on carpet and hard floors, and also over feet, sleeping dog tails etc.The controls are easy to use and didn't seem to require any figuring out.We haven't tried it in water yet, and of course the 5 year old wants to throw it in the tub, but I think we'll wait on a much puddle or something.The only negative I can see are batteries - but I guess that's par for the course. Invest in some rechargeables - it seems like everything this child owns requires batteries, and mostly AA."
3,toyswebe,Waste of money.... The thing barely makes it through the grass.... Will never purchase another one of these products again.
3,Dosen't work as expected,"I completely agree to A.Harris comments titled ""Please read before you buy, May 30, 2010"". Car takes reverse directions what you expect from remote. Picture is misleading the lights do not glow."
3,stops in wate,Ithink its a cool toy but in water the battery stopped and the back of the car was below the water but when it snows its quiet fun romping around but the tires get snow on them witch causes it to slow down.
2,Tough for 4 year old to use this,"The control are too sensitive and difficult for kids to handle. Once it does not respond to what they expect, the kids stop using it and lose the fun in this toy."
4,not a fast car,i got this car for my birth day three years ago and its still going strong plus it dosent take alot of battery juice but it dose not go very fast at all for 20 dollars its a nice buy.
1,Can not even open the battery compartment of remote,This toy is made up of poor quality material. I can not even unscrew the screw of battery compartment to put batteries in. Screw is stuck and metel of screw is abrading with screw driver. Plastic is also cracking. These is long atenna on toy plastic cover of that came off in one day and now that wire drags with toy (as my son try to play with the car by hand).
1,broken,I bought this toy for my nephews birthday. They put batteries in it and it didnt work. have to return
2,Ok........,this is a fun toy but after about two weeks it broke. it's fun but Warning if you buy this and it breaks i told YOU.
1,DO NOT BUY,This is the worst RC car you could buy for your little boy or girl. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. The car worked for two days and then it stopped working.
1,sucked,Isnt water proof like it claims hit a puddle and fried wont nuty again do not buy this item mot worth it at all
2,Not so amphibious,Worked fine on land for awhile but stopped working the first time it was introduced to water. Disappointing considering that is one of the primary selling points.
3,Gator,"Was a good price, but you get what you pay for. I was a little disappointed in the quality of this product."
2,Amphibious amschmibious,"We got two different varieties of this same toy for our 5-year old twins for Christmas. They were pretty excited and went to test them out before the wrapping paper ever hit the floor. They had fun inside on the wood floor, where the cars ran very well.However, once we got bundled and went outside to test the amphibious qualities of the cars we all soon realized that, despite being amphibious, they performed very poorly on uneven ground - same for the snow and the lake shore. Basically these cars have about 1/8 inch of clearance and get stuck on anything they drive over. Although they are marketed as amphibious, it only means that they are watertight; they CANNOT handle the slightest bit of topography. After the boys tried getting them to run on snow, soil and rocks a few times they gave up and started sledding.The boys still use them, but only in the house. If you want to get a functional outdoor R/C vehicle then this is NOT the car you are looking for."
1,Zero durability,I bought this for my grandson for Christmas. All new batteries were installed in the remote control and the car. For the 1st 5 minutes my grandson was having lots of fun learning how to manipulate the control and make the car go and it just stopped. I put in another new set of batteries. The remote light comes on but nothing happens. The on/off switch seems to work properly and both antennas are in tack but it simply does not work after 5 minutes. A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! Not worth a dime!
4,Fun toy,"My son just received this for his 6th birthday and we have ALL enjoyed playing with it. We have not tried it on water and probably will not until summer but it drives great in the house, on the carpet and the hardwood floors. I think it was definitely worth buying for him and he is able to control it easily."
2,Uneven number of batteries,"Why do most toys require uneven batteries? Instead of 3 batteries, why not 2 or even 4 batteries? Why should I buy this toy just to find a dead and useless battery 1 year later under my couch? In my opinion this toy, and many other products, should find a way to use an even number of batteries. This could save all of us money on batteries. IS THE BATTERY COMPANY BEHIND ALL THIS MADNESS??!! (SCARY MUSIC IN BAKGROUND)...0__0"
4,good toy,I have had this for a month and have had no problems with it. my 2 1/2 yr old and 4 1/2 yr old are enjoying it. I had some concerns about some of the reviews but purchased it anyway. It is a really fun toy. We haven't tried it in the water yet.
1,Not for water!!!,"I wish I had read all of the reviews before ordering this thing for my almost 5 yr old for Christmas. But instead I went with the overall average of reviews. What a disappointment it has turned out to be. It worked just fine out of the box, but once it went into the water, it stopped working for a few days. We drained it and dried it off, but that didn't seem to make a difference.When it seemed to be working a few days later, my son used it in the water again. While it was floating, it seemed to stop responding well to the remote. I had to fish it out of the pool since he could not get it to turn around and come back to the edge of the pool. I drained it, wiped it off and set it aside to dry out. Two days later, it is not working at all.Good thing we kept the packaging. It's going back and we are NOT getting another one! I would give this a zero rating if I could. One star is the minimum."
4,Just what we wanted.,"We were looking for a remote controlled vehicle for our 4-year-old son and this is perfect. He hasn't completely mastered the controls (it's only been a couple of weeks). But he can drive it well enough to have lots of fun with it. His dad, grandpa and cousins also had a lot of fun driving it. So far we have only been inside, but we are looking forward to trying it out outside."
5,Good for a 3-year-old,"This toy has got power! My 3-year-old son learned how to use the controls on day 1. I was surprised by how powerful it is. It's an excellent remote-control-car. We haven't tried it in water, and because of negative water reviews of this toy, we won't try. But at least if he accidentally drives it through a little puddle on the sidewalk, there shouldn't be any problems. That's a huge plus for a toy that can be used outdoors. My son loves to use it indoors as well."
2,Hard to control for kids and adults,"Bought this as a gift for a 2 year old boy - he was excited to open and play with it, but he had trouble controlling it. So did his dad. Thumbs down."
3,Iffy,this lil thing is a beast... but the rubber on the antenna falls off ALOT.. its pretty hard to steer so more for bigger kids (my fiancee is still working on how to use and we bought for our 3 year old) havnt tried water yet a bit nervous too actually but will see...also it randomly doesnt wanna back up
5,Great toy,I got this as a gift for my nephew and he loves it! Seems fairly well build and works as it should. I would recommend this if you're looking for something for a child around 5-10.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"We bought this for our son for Christmas just 2 months ago. He has played with it twice for about 5 minutes each time. And now it doesn't work. With it being winter, we never even had a chance to try it outside. So I know it didn't get dirty or wet or anything like that. Just stopped working and with only a 60 day return through Amazon, we cannot exchange/return. Sounds like it's hit or miss with this car working or not based on reviews I've read. I'd spend more money for a better product. I purchased this for $18 hoping I was getting a good deal instead of a cheap product but I was wrong."
1,can't use more than one,I bought 3 thinking all the kids could race and play this is my first time buying RC car and kid galaxy see won't get any more bought 2 online from amozon at 20.00 each found them at JCP for $11.00 I was going to return 2 I got online after shippping would still come out $7.00 ahead no where on the box is it state that you can't run 2 cars that need to be on there and noway to change frecuency to work so $40.00 down the drain
3,Controls are a little different,"I bought this for my 5 year old for his birthday and he never seemed to get into this car. It sits in the playroom and doesn't get much use. I've driven it around and the controls seem a little different than the left right updown joystick pegs of radio controlled cars I played with when I was a kid. This car takes a little more coordination to drive as the controls work together to steer. It's been a while since I've driven it so if you want more detail, please comment and I will get the toy out and explain exactly what I mean. We haven't taken it outdoors (yet) but it looks like it could withstand a lot of water and sand and keep ticking."
2,Fun but not good quality make and light dont work,"Car is Fun to play with.Pros : Good Control, and fast turning etcCons: Plastic and make is cheap, the on off button does not move smooth, slows down even on grass ."
2,fun but not for water,Fun little toy for my 4 1/2 yr old grandson. Then he tried it in the bathtub. It worked great for 2 minutes then shorted out. Tried to dry but no success. It won't work at all anymore. A faulty design that lets water into the battery area despite their claims. Keep it out of water and it is fun.
2,Beware: fake lights - the lights are not real!!!,"Purchased this one to replace an old Gator which was broken. Everything seemed similar until my boy realized that the lights are not real - not like the old version that the lights actually worked when the car switched on. Fortunatly, we did not threw away the old one and will find some technician to fix the that. Really disapointing!I would not hesitate to give a 5 star for the old version but not this one. I use to buy toys from this maker but will no longer do so!"
2,Didn't work after it got wet.,My grandson put this toy in the tub and it wouldn't work right after that. I was dissapointed because it's made to go in water. It also didn't work that well outside.
2,What a let down.,"I bought this for my son since he loves R/C(Just like dad.) It performed pretty well in the house, even though it was pretty loud. Outside it didn't even have a chance. With the low clearance and hard plastic tires, it didn't do much but get stuck. Being winter we opted to try it in the tub. It floated ok when we first put it in, but upon driving it, it filled with water and sank. Drained it and let it dry to no avail. It never worked again.On a side note, the remote is not waterproof at all. Due not let it get wet."
4,Great for little boys,"If you're looking for something that will challenge your child, help with fine motor skills, give endless hours of play-time and be strong enough to survive a 5-year-old's energy, this is it. This toy is well-made and easy to use. My son mastered the controls within minutes of getting his hands on it. It makes the perfect amount of noise to satisfy a boy and a grown-up (meaning, it's not noisy!). There are no little parts that can break off. The olive-green and brown color makes it perfect for the 5-6 year age group.It moves smoothly and even does some great tumbles if maneuvered right. It rode great on snow and did some crazy jumps that thrilled an audience composed of toddlers. Neither puddles nor slush seemed to hinder it in any way. It's totally worth the $20 price tag.It does need 2 AAA batteries for the control and 2 AA batteries for the truck. But that was expected."
2,"Great for a day, then DONE!","My son was so excited to get this toy, purchased from Amazon. The ""antenna"" is a long string and hangs out the top of the car. It did not stand up as pictured! The car worked great for the first 24 hours, until it was picked up by the antenna which promptly fell right out of the toy. It will now only go a few feet unless you follow right behind it with the remote. Knowing kids will play with this toy, the antenna should have been more secure instead of flopping around. It also did not go in water. What a waste of $20!"
3,Doesn't drive on water!!!,"I was so excited about this car....sounds sooo cool....if it actually drove in the water like it's supposed to!!! Each time I placed it on top of the pool surface or in the bath tub, it immediately died and didn't drive!! I mean how lame that a toy meant to drive through water doesn't really do it! It does work good on dry land and looks cool. Would not recommend if you want to actually use it on water!"
1,Great toy if you only want to play with it twice,"I should have listened to the review that said 'this toy will break, if you buy it and it stops working then I told YOU'. This toy worked once right after we bought it. The batteries were dead the next day. Replaced them. Used it once more for an hour, had a lot of fun. Batteries ran out. Replaced them. Then we tried to use it a third time at the beach and it worked for about 5 minutes and then quietly passed away. Now the wheels don't turn at all. It is totally dead. Such a waste of money. Disappointing because my son loved this toy for the few minutes when it worked."
2,No working headlights,"We bought another to replace one from last Christmas that suffered at the hands of a friend's child, and much to our child's disappointment, the headlights are no longer designed to light up. Very durable in water and dirt, decent motor, decent controls, and I would recommend it, but the lack of headlights made me want to return it."
2,"Nice idea, but poor quality control.",Cute little car but only runs for 10 seconds before stopping and requiring a reset on the switch. Now I have to find something else for my son by Christmas....
4,Fun for younger children,"Got this for our 4 year old for Christmas - a first RC car. Not fast, but then again, it doesn't ding the furniture when it runs into things. Happy with it - goes great, easy to handle. No complaints. Not sure about the in/out of water features yet."
1,Avoid - terrible controls,"Purchased for my 4yo son.I didn't realize before buying it that it does not have traditional ""forward back"" + ""left right"" control sticks. My fault probably, but I missed that.- One stick controls the left side two wheels and the other stick controls the right side two wheels - kind of like a tank.- The sticks are actually on/off only - no variable speed control.- The radio control implementation has some serious reception problems as well, very patchy in whether it works or not, cuts in and out.The combination of the above three characteristics makes it extremely hard to drive for me, never mind my son. Basically a waste of money, he never touches it.It does appear fairly durable, and might be fun outside, but given the control difficulty we didn't even bother."
1,Almost unusable,"For the price, I didn't expect a very high quality. But at least, something operational. Actually, the main problem is the radio range, that for me is about 1 meter (3 ft). It's almost impossible to control the toy from a longer distance (the commands become erratic). So you have to follow it as if you were linked by a short wire. And no question to put it in a pond, the risk of loosing it is too high! One more thing : the pictures show working headlights, and some user reviews confirm they're working. Well, they removed this feature without notice, the new models don't have headlights anymore."
5,"So far, so good","my 3 1/2 half got this for Christmas. He is running the wheels off of it. Don't seem to eat up batteries like other reviews have mentioned--we have been using rechargable AA, AAA in it. I can see how the on/off switch can break. We just leave it on the on position and don't have a problem with it--it doesn't seem to effect the life of the batteries."
3,Fun But Died...,"4 year old loved this... was his favorite bday present of everything we got. Played with it non-stop for days, then it died. The motor just stopped working right and it was running very slow and VERY loud. We took it apart, tried to see what was wrong, couldn't figure it out, and then it just died completely. Price is nice, but we will probably go for quality over cheapness next time..."
2,Disappointed,"We bought it for our 4 year old for Christmas. He loves remote control cars so I thought this would be a hit. He played with it for 1 hour and has never gone back to it. Its difficult to operate, and also does not seem very well constructed. In the end, I think it was an overpriced toy that he will never play with again."
1,camera,I bought this camera about 6 months ago and it doesn't forward the film any longer ---I'm not happy at all. This is a first for Amazon which usually sells the best with former purchases.
5,Every African American needs to read this book,"This book deals with the prejudice that society has for black people but how we as a group of people discriminate against ourselves. It is a practical look at how we hold ourselves back for the last 200 years. Every one needs to read this book to wake up and stop prejuding people based on the color of there skin, education or family background. Finally our youth need this book to see what is really going on and why it needs to change. I though this book would make an excellent play or television show."
1,Anatomy of a historical fraud,"First of all, there was no Willie Lynch.The whole ""Willie Lynch"" business comes from a chain letter that spread throughout the Black community in 1993, which appears to have been based on a segment from a 1935 fictional Russian novel entitled ""The Black Consul"" by Anatoli Vinogradov that dealt with Napoleon's supposed plans to divide and conquer the Haitians during the Haitian Revolution. This is pure pseudo-history that has nothing more than emotional appeal for African-Americans and is a prime example of why Black scholars should get out of their ivory towers and teach the masses the truth about our history.The truth about the effect of slavery on Black Americans can be found in slave narratives like ""The Narrative of Frederick Douglass"" and Kenneth Stampp's ""The Peculiar Insitution."" Leave this Willie Lynch mess to the street-corner crackpots."
3,There's A Willie Around Here..Y'all!,"Everyone claiming to be black in America these days, should have at least one copy of Laleh's book on their shelf and in their minds and hearts? It was riveting to me personally, as a bi-racial(Black American),...It elevated me intellectually, to a level that reminded me of the messages from our brothers...James Baldwin, Richard Wright and Cornell West, just to mention a few literary titans whose skin color was black. Most of us, black-folkes have experienced the degredation, and genocidal tendencies alluded to in your book, ""How To Kill Your Willie Lynch!"" But without a doubt, your book has once again awaken me to the blackness in our creation and to our dangerous curiosity to assimilate towards the norm,...to lay bare our inner-souls. Yes! I found your book to very informative and yet, entertaining...Please continue to bless us all with your thoughts and recollections.Darkmandca"
4,Great overview book. Perfect 1st step,This book was an awesome overall introduction to the things that need to be considered.
5,Good information.,"I love this book. It has an easy to use dictionary full of general, everyday words and useful phrases. It also has a grammar lesson in the begining.For someone studying on their one in spare time or just starting out, it's awesome. Lots of words you use everyday and phrases as well.I do agree with the other reviewer, if you are in a college class or advance and need to use words like, it's not the greatest."
4,Finnish Dictionary,My husband is doing some family geneology research and needed to translate some Finnish words on the back of several photographs. This should help although he hasn't figured out some of the words.
2,not too terrible,"if you intend to use this dictionary to visit finland, you would be well off. however, if you intend to use this dictionary to learn the language (for instance, in a college class) this is far from being the best dictionary out there. i'd recommend the hippocrene concise dictionary."
5,Book of the Year,"Calvert's expertise in media law shines through in this eye-catching and attention holding book. Calvert's research is very thorough, very interesting and extremely relevant. Anyone who has ever watchted television or surfed the web should purchase this book and gain a better understanding of the world around them. Forget ""highly recommended"" This book is rated, ""Enter your shipping address here.."""
5,Love these books,"I belong to a reading group in my local neighborhood library, and one of the folks in the group suggested Taro Gold's books of wisdom to us. Since then, we always open and close our meetings by reading a thought from Open Your Mind, Open Your Life. I keep a copy at work to start my day off on a positive note as well. Taro Gold's books have become my favorite gift to give to friends for birthdays, graduations, and any time I want to uplift someone's spirit."
3,I thought this was a book,I was very disappointed with my order because I thought this was a hardcover of some 100 to 300 pages when it arrived it was a pamphlet of less than 25 pages of small quotes. It was very powerful quotes but still was looking forward to a small hardcover not a small pamphlet
5,"Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Eastern Wisdom (Large Second Volume)",Was seeking more truth and wisdom. This is a quick and very interesting read. Great book glad I bought it...learning more everyday.
5,Beautiful Book,What a beautiful book Taro Gold has produced. I received a copy as a gift from a friend and enjoyed it so much I gave it away to my sister. I am now going to order more for gifts and to keep myself. Giving this book is a gentle way to encourage people and uplift their spirits.
3,Too technical for me,"Read this if you have a pHD in Chinese studies. Then it might be interesting. Especially because the chinese text is printed along side the translation for those who want to do their own translating. The text comes from a dig in China, and is much younger than the traditional I Ching, with hexagrams in different order, etc. There is some new material not seen before, so there is value."
4,Great CD,"Carolyn Dawn Johnson's songs Georgia and Complicated caught my attention on the radio and led me to take the plunge on this CD. What a great move that was.Carolyn Dawn Johnson's first CD is an enjoyable collection of songs that show a range and variety that is truly remarkable. She has a beautiful voice, catch lyrics and a set of songs that will get stuck in your head. This is one CD that I've put into the CD player and it rarely leaves it. If Carolyn is the future of country music, then we are in more than capable hands."
3,Just another album,"Well, I don't deny that CDJ is one of the best debuts of the year and has potential to rise to great heights of success.Overall, her album's true shining gems are few and in between, ""Georgia"", ""Complicated"" & ""MAsterpiece"". Her album is quite a whole one, as in she goes for how the songs compliment each other, rather than seeing if it'll be a hit. HOwever, her interpretation of her songs can be improved. The lack of a nice catchy melody is made up by unusual harmony combinations.This album is overall artistic and the type of 'true to myself' music.It's good, but I have heard much better albums than this. An attempt that should have some credit though. I have yet to grow to like it. Hopefully I do."
5,Exactly what I needed for my lava lamp,"It's so hard to find a decent lava lamp that works the way it's supposed to. I bought a new to replace my old one, as the bulb had broken off inside the socket. My intention was to throw the old one away. The new one doesn't flow the way it is supposed to, along with a myriad of other issues. I had been happy with my previous one, so I used pliers and was able to screen the remaining light out of the socket and then found this bulb replacement on Amazon. I felt it was a great price and the shipping was reasonable, everyone else wanted $5 for shipping what? I received this yesterday, it came shipped in a plastic bag wrapped with some bubble wrap. Bulb was intact and I have given my favorite lava lamp a new lease on life."
5,Good small lamp,"I was looking for a lamp for used in a small base desk lamp. This was the right product and a good price. The lamps arrived promptly and were well packaged. Fit perfectly and worked well, with and without an external dimmer. Good buy."
1,Very Poor Choice,"I too went to the internet to find replacement bulbs and was delighted to find bulbs way cheaper than what I was paying at Lowes. Unfortunately cheaper means less for your money. In this case, I paid about half what Lowes would charge and only got two or three hours of use out of each bulb. Certainly no value at all in purchasing cheaper bulbs. In my opinion these bulbs aren't worth $0.25 in the $1.00 store.Pay the Lowes price for quality bulbs."
5,Fab Disc! Shag-olicious !!!,"A strong and very fun compendium of Ms. Bardot's 60's vocal recordings. This reviewer is someone who (1) has always enjoyed Ms BB, and (2) believes that she was a much better singer than many people realized. Ms. Bardot had a wonderful voice for unabashed pop music: She sounded like she looked, and that's saying something. Five seconds into the first tune (Appareil à Sous) you know for sure that you are in for a swinging time.... beach tunes, club dance music, motorcycles, audio erotica, bubblegum, etc. In addition, there is a notable cast of musical collaborators, as mentioned in other reviews here. Finally, and to quote another reviewer, you also get the ""... tres belle photo sur la couverture."" I have listened to this CD occasionally for 8-9 years now, and I always look forward to hearing it once more. If I lost this one I'd acquire it again."
5,This is the tub to buy!!!,"I absolutely love this tub. It was a shower gift, and 15 months later I am still using it for bath time. It worked great with the ""newborn sling"" for the early months, then later without the sling for the sitting-up era. It even works now for the climbing era, staying in place when the little guy moves around. It's sturdy, good-looking, practical and reasonably priced. I notice other reviewers have commented on the temperature feature not working, but in my tub if the water is too hot the indicator on the tub turns white as it should. However, I don't rely on the indicator anyway but use my judgment regarding water temp.I really like the non-slippery, padded surfaces inside the tub. But for me the best feature is the fact it truly works as a newborn tub with the sling, and later as a toddler tub on its own. Sturdy, practical, comfortable - just add water, bubble bath and rubber duckies and you're all set!"
5,GREAT TUB,"We have used this tub since my son came home from the hospital. I like the tub because it has the 2 sides to it, it has a non slip backing to it, it has a plug that changes colors when the water gets too warm.Get this tub for your newborn."
4,Like it so far,"My six week old daughter is starting to like her baths more and more. She rests comfortably in the newborn cradle and allows me to just wash and pamper her. She's not old enough yet to be too active in the bath tub, so I can't comment on the versatility of this tub - but so far it's been easy to use, easy to fill up and fit anywhere and I've gotten great usage out of it. I recommend this tub to all new parents!"
4,Outgrew it too quickly,"I loved this tub, for the first 2 months. I have an 11 week old little girl, and she has outgrown the tub already. I went out and purchased the Euro tub by Primo, and love it. It is a great next step bath tub."
3,Baby can't fit,"It worked really well during the first 4 months. But after that, the baby wouldn't fit in the ""infant"" side - the tub seemed too short. At that time he was too young to sit in the ""toddler"" side and at 5 months of age, we had to retire the baby tub to the basement."
2,3 month limit,"This tub was ok for the first 2-3 months, but by then I found that I had a lot of issues. Once my daughter could hold her head up, she did not want to lean back on the support mat for the infant side, but she could not sit up well enough for the toddler side. She slid around in it alot, and the plastic was so hard, that I feared she would whack her head when she looked from side to side. Once she could sit up, I tried it again, and she was too big. It was awkward, and uncomfortable for both of us. I would skip over this item, and go straight for a bath cushion."
4,This is an excellent tub!,"Giving a bath as a first time parent was made less terrifying by the sling. When my daughter was big enough to do without the sling this tub fit perfectly on the floor of our tiny shower stall. This tub is deeper than the other brands I've seen so I think it will last longer, my daughter is now almost 6 months and not quite able to sit up on the toddler side but has become quite comfortable lounging on the baby side... she likes to put her tailbone on the bump in the middle which allows her to touch the other end with her feet, making her feel more secure. I don't see how that can be comfortable but she manages to get into the position no matter how many times I scoot her back. My only dislike is that the trough on the end quickly fills up with water and can't drain. Anything that you put into the trough then floats in cold stale water until you turn the whole tub over to drain it. But that's a very small complaint, I love this tub!"
5,Rub a Dub Dub,"Because I didn't receive a bath tub for my baby shower, I had to venture out to find one for myself. As a new mom, I had NO clue what to get. I saw that this tub was adjustable for newborns and toddlers, which lead me to believe that I could save a little money down the line. Boy, was I right. This tub is great. The baby ""hammock"" for newborns is really nice because you have enough control to wash with one hand and hold onto your baby with the other, without him sliding down into the water too far.To be honest, we don't use the tub as much anymore. I find it more convenient just to bring my son in the shower with me, but we still use it occasionally, and I'm sure we'll get more use out of it when he gets a little older too. Even though we don't use it all that often, I think buying this tub was a steal. It's great."
1,Horrid,"I bought the tub from Amazon. It didn't come with a hammock, but I thought I must have read it wrong because I was reviewing many different tubs. I was too busy to go back and check after it arrived. So I kept it 'as is', liking the infant/toddler advantages. Let's just say it was fine for the first couple months. But when my baby started wiggling and kicking his little legs, his little bottom would be on top of that divider and would continue to slide down farther. I spend every bath frantically holding him in place with one hand. This is a horrible tub, I hate it. The one I had for my first child was another of these models and I hated IT too. He is not old enough to use the toddler side yet, he just turned 6 months. Man, I can't wait to get him on that other side."
3,Doesn't grow with baby!,"This was a great tub for a newborn. However, my son is now six months old and big for his age. He wiggles too much for this tub and it is already too small for him. He cannot sit up on his own so we cannot use the toddler end of the tub. He's too big for the newborn end. I end up bathing him in the kitchen sink (without the tub), which is just as easy as bathing him in this tub. If I could choose again, I'd pick something bigger."
3,No packaging,"The Infant tub was OK. However, it came loose in the mailing box without packing material of any kind. Consequently, I had to wrap the tub, which wasextremely difficult due to the odd size. Impossible to make the wrapping paper look nice."
4,fast service,"It was what I expected but I was a litte disappointed because I didn't save as much as I thought I did, but my shiping was free so that was def the upside of it."
1,Not recommended,"joining the rest of the reviews. The infant sit is not comfortable, my daughter can't sit in it steady and we have to hold her. She still can't sit in the toddler section. looks comfortable but not at all. I will not use in the next child."
2,Mold and gunk problems,This tub has 2 small spots that store gross mold and gunk from soap and water that doesn't completely clean out when you rinse it. It is not sanitary. Other than that it is a good tub so they should re-design it. I would recommend the Eurobath!
3,"Great, but what toddler fits in this?","This was a wonderful tub for our child when he was an infant. However, at about 5 months, he was simply too long for it. Finding an alternative was difficult and finding a place to store this huge item in our small townhome was complicated. If you have an attic or likewise storage, go for it.... otherwise, you might want to reconsider."
5,Lovin it!!!,"This tub is perfect for newborn to infant. I am not sure yet about the toddler thing because my 9 month old is getting very wiggly and may be promoted from the kitchen sink to the bath tub. However, I can still use this tub in the bathtub."
4,Not cushioned enough,This tub is okay. I got it as a gift from my baby shower and it had good reviews. But I think it needs more cushion. I put small towels in it for him to lie against. And the draining whole leaks while I give my son a bath.
5,A GREAT tub!,"We are really happy with this tub. It fits perfectly in our sink which is round across the back and straight in the front. The infant hammock is a great feature and our son must think it's comfortable because he does NOT cry in it! The only thing is that he does slide down in the hammock and his feet don't stay in it too well, they fall off the side of the hammock and I have to put them back in for him (he's a little wiggly though!) Overall, this is a wonderful tub, especially for the price!"
3,Not crazy about this tub.,"I am not so crazy about this tub. My son has always and continues to seem uneasy in it. The infant part seems to have him back to far and the toddler part is too upright. He never looks comfortable! Plus, he is 27 inches and does not fit. He can not splash around! I would try another tub but he sits up now so we just put a mat in the big bath tub and I sit with him."
5,The tub that does it all,"Compared to the other inclined/padded tubs that I tried, this one actually gets baby wet and lets her splash a little too. Although I got this after my baby's ""sling"" baths were over, I like the versatility. Sling for newborns, incline for non-sitters, and seat for sitters. It fits my double sink well, where the sprayer makes a great mini shower head to easily rinse baby. It don't won't hold a baby that is old enough to ""toddle"" but my 9 month old (albeit a preemie) still fits and will for a while more I suppose. By then it will be time for big tub baths w/ more toys anyway."
5,Got it as default gift-Loved it like no other!,"As a first time mom, every decision was important to me from toenail clippers to cribs. I registered for a different bathtub that was more expensive, but got this one instead. I kept it and am glad I did because I LOVE IT and so does my baby! My baby is now 3 months old and I don't know how new mom's bathe their babies WITHOUT the hammock. I was surpirsed how slippery and awkward it was to wash a baby at first, but it was much easier to wash/hold her as the hammock left one hand free. A must-have for all new moms!"
4,Great tub.,"I have a two year old and 6 month old, and they were both bathed in this tub. My youngest still is. My sink is small and shallow and this tube still fits over it. Being able to use the vegetable sprayer makes baths quick and easy. Both of my kids loved the hammock, but since they both loved to kick and splash, they moved out of it after about a month to 6 weeks. By the time my son was big enough to sit on the straight backed infant side, he preferred the big bath tub. But now if I want I can even put this tub in the big bathtub and bathe both kids at the same time. I received this as a gift, so I'm not 100% sure on price, but I think it's one of the less expensive and it's definitely worth it."
5,FABULOUS,"Perfect for infants. Our baby was in this for 9 months. The sling was perfect for the first month until his cord fell off, then the seats were wonderful. I wouldn't call it infant to toddler, because a toddler would would be way too big to fit comfortably, but it is great for the first while. I was very satisfied with our purchase."
2,not baad,"it's difficult to wash your newborn baby, he is freezing in the air, I got rid of this tab and bought a classic one. very happy now!"
5,Love this tub,"My husband and I love this tub. Our son is 6 months old and we've used it since he was born. We attached the sling (it's a net that resembles a hammock) to the tub when he was a newborn and he fit right into it. He hung, just like a hammock, across the length of the tub. The sling is a great feature for newborns because they can lie down on it.When my son outgrew the sling, we sat him on the newborn side of the tub (the big green pad that baby leans against). If you don't remember that the big green pad is the newborn side, ""Newborn"" is etched on the top of the blue frame of the big green pad. Now that my son can sit up on his own, we switched him to the opposite side of the tub where his butt sits on the small green pad. ""Infant Toddler"" is etched on top of the back that baby leans against.We're very happy with this tub. My friend registered for the same tub for her baby shower and I told her we have the same tub and love it."
3,Great Tub for a toddler,I got this tub for my cousins new baby and she has mentioned-how great it is. The size which makes it last for a bit longer to use.
3,Could be better,"My daughter is 4 months old, and this tubs works pretty well. However, it didn't fit the sink in our apartment, and when you put it in the big bathtub, it slips all over the place. The inclined seat and the spongy bottom are helpful in dealing with a slippery baby, though. Hopefully, it will fit better in the sink at our new house."
3,Cute but not perfect,"I wanted a tub that would grow with my baby so I put this on my registry because it has three stages from newborn, to infant that can sit up, to toddler. My baby is still only two months old, so I can only speak on the first stage. My baby keeps slipping down in the mesh seat so that the back of her head goes into the water if I'm not holding her up with one hand. If she turns her head water will go into her ears or mouth. To end on a positive note, I like how the tub fits into my kitchen sink and the plug will turn white if the water is too hot."
4,Great tub,"We really like this tub! The hammock is a nice feature for a newborn, and we stopped using it when our baby was around 3 months old. The tub seems to support the baby well and has a little ridge at the bottom to keep early sitters from sliding. We use the baby tub in our own bathtub with no problem, but it didn't fit so well in our below-the-counter kitchen sink. I wish the little drain hole at the bottom would drain at full speed when the tub is sitting flat with baby in it, but I find that I have to tilt the tub a little for a faster drain. Overall this is a great tub and I highly recommend it!"
2,Tub Leaks!!,"After reading all the great reviews on here, I bought this tub and was excited to use it when it arrived. For me, I do not wash my son in the kitchen sink, nor do I wash him in the tub because it hurts to bend down for that amount of time. So, I fill the tub and wash him on my bathroom countertop (its a dual countertop, so its big enough to fit the baby bathtub). After about 3 minutes, of washing my son, I noticed water was dripping from the countertop. And then I realized it came from the stopper. I thought maybe I didn't close it enough, so I pushed down on the stopper, but that didn't do the trick. There was nothing I could do, except to have the tub leak while I was bathing my son. I guess this was made only for sinks and tubs, and not meant to be put on the countertop. I will definitely be returning this item."
4,sling is great,"This tub works well because of the sling (0-2 mos) and I'm sure it will do well when my baby is old enough to hold himself up but for now he enjoys laying on a head supported sponge or mat. It seems way more comfortable, his legs and stomach are more immersed in the water and his head is higher(in the tub it seems to fall to one side or the other. The tub doesn't cradle the head.), so there is less worry about water intake. At 4 mos he enjoys kicking and splashing and has more room lying on a mat in a big tub."
2,not enough support,"In the begining this tub was great. The infant sling made bathing my son so easy but when he got big enough to sit in the infant reclining seat, I found he was always slipping to the side or off the bump which is supposed to support him like a seat. Then i started noticing little bruises on his bum. I wasn't sure if it was the tub at first but i didnt know what else it could be so I stopped using it immediatly. when the bruises went away I wanted to be sure it was the tub and not something i was still using. So I went back to the tub one last time and sure enough it was all the slipping and sliding, even with me holding him up he still got bruised."
4,To grow with,"This tub worked great for my small baby and is growing well with her. The sling we used was great. She did slip down in it because she was not a big baby. Other than that, tub was great."
3,Great tub in the beginning...,"We loved this tub when my son was first born. The sling cradled him very comfortably. Now at 4 months he is too big for the sling. He seems very uncomfortable sitting in the tub without the sling. When i use the slanted side for newborns, it seems to squish his little ""boy parts"". He is still too small for the other side which sits up more. We will try this tub out for a few more weeks, hopefully he will grow to like it a little more as he gains more control. The drain plug is nice, and it fits great in our sink. The slip resistant pads keep him in place too."
5,This Tub is GREAT!,"My daughter is now 7 months old and we've been bathing her in this tub since she was only 2 weeks. The mesh sling was fantastic for the first 5-1/2 months. It kept her secure and accessible for quick bathing. Now that she's too big for the sling, she loves sitting up and splashing the water in her tub. It's not as big and intimidating as a bathtub, but works great! I love the drain plug."
5,"Perfect Tub, especially for newborns","I think this is a wonderful tub and besides my Fisher Price Swing this is my favorite purchase. Its especially perfect for newborns because it has a sling, I dont need any help bathing baby. Our son is now 10 wks old, we have been bathing him in this since he was a week old. The tub holds enough water to keep baby nice and warm. Im not sure how it would work for an older infant - 12 mnths +, but this is a must have for a newborn (0-6 mnths at least)."
3,corners collect dirt!,"I have been using this tub for 9 months with my little girl. She loves it, but I noticed that on the newborn side, the corners that are meant to latch on to the sink fill with... something? I always drain and flip the tub right away but I can't seem to get into those two corners to clean because they are so deep. I am a little concerned about bacteria filling in those spots and I plan on switching to a blow up duck tub I also got for my shower."
3,OK bath tub,"I thought this would be the perfect bathtub for my infant son. Well, it is okay, but definitely not perfect. However, I am not sure there is a perfect one out there. This tub does have a lot of nice features. It has 2 built-in positions, one that is reclined for infants, and one that is upright for older babies and toddlers. It also comes with a sling that can be used for sponge bathing newborns, however I never used it. It fits in any size sink (single or double). The drain turns white when the water is too hot. My biggest problem with the tub is that my 3-month-old son hates to sit in the reclined section, but can't sit up well enough on his own to be in the upright section. I can't give him a bath by myself b/c I need my husband to hold my son up for me while I wash him. If you have a baby that is content to be reclined than you will probably really like this tub."
5,A FANTASTIC TUB- 5+ stars!,"I think this is wonderful. My daughter loved baths from the get go and I think I can attribute it to the security she felt in this tub. She uses the ""hammock"" and just lies there, kicks back and relaxes while we bathe her. The sling is the perfect invention for bathing newborns/infants, because most people feel nervous about the whole idea of one person holding on to a slippery, soapy baby and the other person cleaning and rinsing off. With this ""hammock"", you really don't need an extra set of hands! LOVE IT!"
2,not impressed,i read the reviews on this and I disagree with most people.. i think the tub looks very uncomfortable and I have to hold onto my baby with one hand while I wash him cause he is always scooting around and he slides easily. i think for when they are younger the cheap sponge ones are easier to use. and by the time they can sit up.. just put them in the actual tub.
5,"Great, inexpensive tub","This is a great tub. I feel like my 2 month old is very secure in it. I never used the sling, but that is a great feature. It drains really easy and dries quickly. It is a little cumbersome to store, but it is well worth it!"
3,Its Ok,Can be use comfortably for only 6 month baby. You rather send more money and buy a better one which fits your baby above 6 months.
1,only good for 5 months,"it is said that you can used for toddler. but even for my 8 month son, it is not comfortable to sit inside&#12290;also there are lots of small corners , which accumulate lots of dirt and hard to clean."
1,Not BPA free,I purchased this item thinking it was BPA and phthalate free but it is not. It's never a good sign when there isn't even a recycling symbol on the item. We're trying to be as plastic free as possible so I returned it same day and plan to buy the Eurobath as a replacement. I will say that Diapers.com was exceptionally nice with the return. They provided a prepaid shipping label within minutes of my phone call to customer service.
3,Not for big babies!!,"This was good for about a month. We have a VERY large baby. He was born 9 lbs 3 ozs and 21 inches; now is 6 months and 27.5 lbs and 30.5 inches. We used the newborn sling for the first month or so and it was great. Once he outgrew the sling, he was already too big for the ""infant"" side and didn't sit up well enough for the ""toddler"" side. So, if you are expecting a bigger baby, I wouldn't recommend this tub."
3,mom of 3-month old,"This is the first tub I bought for my baby. I ended up buying another one because my baby has a hard time staying in the infant section. The slick plastic that is supposed to hold her (...) in place doesn't. She ends up slipping past it and floating up, even with me holding onto her constantly. She is a tall baby, yet her feet don't reach the end, which could help her stay in place. Her head also rests on the hard plastic, not the soft foam, and she has banged her head many times.The good things about the newborn to toddler tub is that the drain is very tight and it holds a lot of water.The next tub I bought had foam the whole length of it, and the leg area rises to help keep her in place. But this one, by Safety First, doesn't hold as much water without it splashing out, and the drain leaked from the first use.I'm still going to search for a better tub."
5,Great Tub,I looked at all tubs online and read reviews before I went to store. I narrowed the choice down to 3 and when I went to store this was the only tub worth buying. My son is 7 weeks and he loves the bath. With the sling for him to be cradled in he is still in water and can kick legs but I have more control with the saftey part of the bath. Also sling easy to throw in washer and dryer so no mildew like the 4 dollar sponges. I highly suggest any new mom getting this tub.
3,Not very pleased,"This tub is a pain in the neck. I struggled with it for 2.5 months. I first used the sling when my son was newborn. He screamed bloody murder because he was so cold. I could not get the water level high enough to keep him warm. Then when he got a little bigger I put him in the infant seat side. I was petrified! He slid around the whole time. It was very stressful. Now the tub sits in the closet, waiting for my son to get older so we can try out the other side. Hopefully that will work better when my son is bigger. Two good points: the plug is convenient and I like the water temp safety feature."
4,Good tub,"This worked out nicely at first. Although I only gave it 4 stars, because my daughter seems to be comfortable in it for only 2-3 months. The netting for the tub is very helpful(which you only use the first few weeks), and stress relieving for new parents with a slippery newborn. It worked well, while it did."
2,liked it at first,"The infant sling was great for sponge baths, but for the last two months we have been using it without the sling and it is not so much fun. The ledge for the recline position is so little that every time my baby kicks her bottom slips off it and I have to reposition her. It is a battle to wash her down without her floating up and slipping off. I tested the plug and put water in so hot I couldn't stand to touch it myself. Although it is supposed to turn white, mine barely changed colors. I still have to use a thermometer to test the temp."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!,"I bought this tub for the room and versatility. The infant/toddler side has nothing on the back support. When my daughter leans back the hard plastic leaves red marks on her spine. So, my husband has to hold her forward while I bathe her. The tub also lacks grip, she slips all over. And when I flip her to the newborn side to rinse her hair, she slips right over the bump and it pushes into her back. Save your money."
2,Be Careful.,"I was not able to use the hammock feature in the beginning, because my daughter was almost 10lbs. The design is great, except for the sides where my baby's foot can get stuck. I was not happy about this at all. If I was not aware that her foot was in that position, I could have hurt her when taking her out of the bath. This tub was ok as a gift, but I would not recommend it due to the fact that it can seriously hurt the baby if you don't pay attention to his/her feet."
2,foam in tub gave my son a rash,"I've had this tub for a little over five months. At first I loved it - I was ready to give it 5 stars but decided to wait on writing a review until I had it for a little longer. The sling worked great while my son was an infant and he loves bath time. Well - he got too heavy for the sling and I started using the tub. Well after about 1.5 months of used w/o the sling, I noticed some bumps on my son's bottom and back. At first I thought it was diaper rash, but then I began to suspect the foam on the tub. I did a before and after inspection of my son and sure enough no rash before the bath and after bath a big rash!! So, I'm now buying a tub that is all plastic. My belief is that the foam is collecting some sort of mold. I guess it's not good enough to just rinse and let it air dry? as a parent I don't have time to disinfect this with clorox and triple rinse every time it's used. 2 stars instead of 1 because it was useful during infancy."
2,Not sure about the sling feature,"My daughter is 6 weeks old so I cannot comment about the use of the tub for an older baby. Using the sling for an infant can be challenging/dangerous because it does not really craddle the baby. My daughter slips down, her feel fall over the sides, and there is not enough give in the fabric for the slind to cup her in. While I always have my hands on her while she is in the tub, it would be nice to have the sling make her more secure in the torso area so I could have more freedom to actually bathe her. I found my daughter almost fell out of the sling, and would have if my hand was on her torso. My daughter is a big newborn (10.8lbs) so her size may have something to do with the lack of safety of the sline, but she is not mature enough to sit up in the tub yet. Just be very careful with the sling and your newborn."
5,The best tub ever!,This is the best tub! My daughter has used this tub since her first bath. She is now 7 months old and still uses it. It has a great hammock for newborns and transitions easily for infants. The tub also fits perfectly in my sink. It has a section to put the washcloth and soap and even has a plug that turns white if the water is hot. My sister-in-law has even decided to get one. I recommend this tub to everyone!!!!!
5,love this tub!,My 2 month old loves this tub! I feel very safe with him in it(of course I attend him at all times while in it) I think the design is overall very good and he seems very content while in it. one of my best baby purchases to date!
4,Great tub!,We finally grew out of this tub at about 6 months! Our baby LOVED it! The sling worked perfectly and we only used it on the reclining side. Only bad thing is that it didn't fit in our sink. We had to lean over the tub to wash baby in it. but all in all it was very convenient!
2,Now what?,After reading the great reviews I went with this tub. During the first use I was frustrated that my baby kept sliding down the sling. I quit using it for awhile and just used the foam turtle in the kitchen sink. Well now that he is bigger we started using the tub again. At 3 months he moves a lot. He is constantly sliding too far over to the side or his bottom lifts up on to the bump. I turned him to the infant/toddler side and he is not really ready for that. So basically this tub has been pretty worthless. I am going to purchase the Primo tub since the molding looks much more effective and safe.
3,Good in the very beginning,"My son was 5 weeks early and even then he didn't fit in the sling. He is about 4 months now (15lbs, 24 inches) and he seems way too big for the infant side, but is not able to sit up enough to go on the other side.This tub fits great in the sink and other than the size we have had no complaints."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed by this tub, as there were so many positive reviews. After our baby was big enough to use the tub without the newborn sling, we had difficulty keeping him from sliding downward. The rest at the bottom of the tub did not seem to be high enough to keep him from slipping. I find it much easier, especially when I am bathing my son by myself, to use one of those teddy bear spounge mats in the tub. Less wiggling around."
5,Great tub!!!!,"I originally had the 4-in-1 bath station for my first daughter and hated it-the water would leak out and it was impossible to close. When shopping for my next daughters tub, I spent a lot of time looking and narrowed it down to this and the Eurobath. I could not give this tub enough praise. It really is wonderful. Fits perfectly in my sink, and fits perfectly under the crib when not in use. I didn't really use the sling that much, only because my daughter didn't particularly care for it-but that doesn't mean that it wouldn't work for others out there. Woth every cent! (Babycenter.com has it for less than babies-r-us- for those looking to save some money)"
2,Outgrown too fast,"Our son was not a large baby, but he grew out of this tub within 3 months. He also hated the sling that came with it. The main problem we found was that our little guy was able to catapult himself upwards so easily when he would kick against the part of the tub that holds the washcloth/soap/etc. This was not safe. On top of that, he never seemed comfy. We ended up buying the Primo Eurobath and it's perfect! Bulky but a great tub. I wish I'd registered for that one in the first place. This Sure Comfort one was a waste of money, in my opinion."
5,Fantastic product,I love this tub. I have been using it since my son was 2 weeks old. It positions him perfectly and makes bath time much more fun and much less stressful. I wouldn't buy any other tub besides this one.
4,"Ok, but baby gets too cold on sling","My one month old daughter screams because the sling gets cold after water hits it then air. The sling does hold her in place, but she is almost too long for it already. The tub does fit in my double kitchen sink just fine. The temperature gauge plug is not accurate, so make sure and test the water yourself before putting in your child."
3,good for the first 2 months,"this is a nice tub for the first 2 months of your baby's life. the green cushion is nice and soft, and there is no need for towel so that the baby does not slip. The big problem is that once the baby grows a little, the tub gets too small, and the baby is not covered in water. Only legs are covered. So they can't play, or splash. I recommend buying Eurotub instead - it is bigger, and also non-slippery, and has a better support, plus you can actually have enough water to cover your baby totally. Plus it might actually work into toddler years, but who knows..."
1,Really disappointed,"I'm sorry to say that this tub has been a real disappointment and I'll be buying something else. As other reviewers have said, the sling suspended my little guy above the water and now that he doesn't need the sling anymore I have to hold up his back in order to wash him or else he slides down. The ""hump"" at the bottom of the tub digs into his back and he doesn't seem to sit comfortably on either side of the tub."
2,Good for newborns but thats about it,This tub was really great until my son reached about 3 months. Stage 1- The little hammock that came was great when he was really little. Stage 2- Then once he got too big for that I sat him on the infant side where there was a little incline for him to rest & there was a little hump to keep him from sliding. Stage 3- Except now he is moving all over the place and the hump isn't big enough and some how he gets over it and slides down to the water & to the sides & it is hard to keep water from getting in his ears etc. & he isn't big enough to sit on the toddler side which is straight up (stage 4). This tub was very frustrating.
3,Doesn't work for older babies,"This is a wonderful idea, if only it worked longer. My little girl is two months old and already she needs something bigger or perhaps just a plain tub. The sitting area for infants are just to shallow and every time she kicks, she slides out and down. Rather get something plain that you could use longer."
1,Would be nice if my daughter ever used it,"I thought I would love this tub. Well I did, and my daughter didn't. I tried using it three times before I abandoned it out of frustration. The problem was that my daughter just didn't like it. When I ended up just placing her in the big bathtub on a foam mat she was okay, but for some reason, the tub just didn't work for us."
5,THE BEST,I HAVE WORN THIS AND IT IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD. THIS IS COMING FROM HARRY EVANS. A MUST GET.
2,Do Not Buy!!,I bought this tub because I had read the reviews for the Aquarium Tub and this one seemed beter. Horrible! The design is poor and the foam stuff that comes on the tub came off. I mean literally peeled right off one day. I do not recommend this tub for any baby. I ended up getting the Aquarium tub I wanted to get her in the first place and so far so good!
3,Item is ok....,"When my son was a newborn this item was great, we never really used the sling so that was kind of useless,but when he could sit up he didn't like being in the laydown tub..So I got him the safety first chair for the bath tub and he loves that! So yes I would recommend the tub for new borns, but not sure on infants who can sit up"
2,not worth it!,"This tub worked really great for the first three months, but after that forget it! He grew too big for the infant side, yet isnt even close to sitting on the toddler side! And its supposed to last until they are toddlers!"
3,Not as good as the Eurotub,"My friend has this one, I have the Eurotub. My baby is 6 mo old and relatively small 14 lbs. He has no room to kick and splash in this tub. From the time he was 2 wks old we've used the Eurotub and it is wonderful. Good support for a newborn and tons of room for an ""older"" baby to have lots of fun. The Sure Comfort is probably great for the first couple of months, but you should check out the Eurotub!"
3,Does not work for my baby,The sling worked great for a couple of weeks when my son was a newborn but he quickly outgrew it. The divider in the middle of the tub was always poking him in the back even with the straps adjusted correctly. I can't get him to fit properly in the reclined infant side (he's 4 mos) and he can't sit up in the toddler side. He's very active and his bottom won't stay in the alloted space behind the divider. He pushes his feet against the tub so that his bottom comes up and rests on the divider. That divider is always in the way. I would rather have a tub without sections.
5,Baby loves to bathe!,We have been giving our newborn baths in this tub since she was 1 week old. The hammock feature is wonderful! My plug DOES change color when the water is too warm. And I can store all the necessities in the little caddy this tub provides. Definitely a back saver!
4,Best Tub For A Newborn!!!,"This is definately the best tub for a newborn. The net on top definately made is easy to bathe, and he fit perfectly in it. After 2 months, we could not use it though. He kept sliding off of the hump that is built in the middle of the tub."
3,My daughter loves her baths...,This tub has been good for us. I liked the padded sling used when she was just a newborn and not big enough for a regular bath. I was able to sponge bath her easily and the sling cradled her nicely. My only complaint about this tub is that I wish it had a support bar that goes between the baby's legs to hold her in place better. DD is 5 months old now and has become more active while bathing. She tends to slide down towards the front of the tub and makes me nervous that her head will go under water.
4,"Tried other tubs, and this was the BEST!","Hi- We registered for a different tub and HATED IT! It was a two piece tub that leaked everywhere (it was literally cut in half!)! Who makes a two peice tub?? So out of frustration went out with everyone and looked for a new tub..price was right, the sling was great and it seemed the right size..so brought it home...LOVED IT! My daughter actually looked like she was happy..the other tub's sling was so weird, hung off the back...she looked miserable. She is now over 7 months and a big girl, about 19 lbs, and she has been in the infant seated position for a few months, and SHE LOVES IT TOO! She splashes around and has so much fun!I would highly recommend this tub for ease of use, cleaning and storage."
3,Okay when they aren't mobile infants.,"We got this tub for our newborn son in March. I loved the hammock feature when he could barely hold his head up. He started sitting up at 5 months but sitting in the ""toddler"" section wasn't a good fit and neither was the newborn section without the hammock. But we finally had to put this away when he started to pull himself up. This tub is great for the non mobile infant, but once they can't sit still, it's time to put this away."
3,"Great for newborn, not for toddler",My son by 3 months was wiggling and splashing so much and the molded plastic did not fit him. We had to search out a new tub. Fantastic for the newborn stage.
5,"So far, so good","My daughter is only 7 weeks old, but so far I love this tub. It fits great in my double sink, and my daughter is always happy when we give her a bath. The mesh cradle allows the water to come through without me having to worry about keeping my daughter's ears and head out of the water."
5,Great for infants!,"This is such a great tub for infants because of the mesh sling that keeps the baby out of the water. We tried a bath cushion and didn't like it as much as we do this. This tub is great due to the 3 levels - infant, newborn and toddler. It drains great and even has an indicator if the water is too hot. Buy it, you won't be sorry."
5,Wonderful product!,My baby is 8 weeks old and loves lying in the hammock when I bathe her. It makes baths so easy and fun!
4,good conversion item,"I never had a problem with the hammock, but my son wasn't a real squirmy baby as a new born. The truth is you don't use the hammock very long anyway. You are only supposed to use it until the baby's umbilical cord falls off, then you put the baby on the reclining side of the tub. Once my son could lay in the tub he loved his baths. Now that he is 8mos old and can sit up on his own He can sit on the other side of the tub that allows him to sit up, splash and play in the water. The compartment on the end is great to keep all your cleaning supplies in place. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was because when my son was on the reclining side he would sometimes slide a little to one side, but you should always keep one hand on your baby at all times at that age while giving them a bath. This should prevent any sliding."
4,Good Tub,"This is a nice baby tub. It does not fit in any of our sinks, so we have to use it in our bathtub, but we are ok with that. The sling works well to keep the little ones up out of the water, but you have to be careful of them sliding down towards the feet - if you have the water level up high enough, baby's mouth can slip under water. We also don't like the fact that there is no way to hang it up. It would be nice if there was just somewhere you could hook onto a hook to hang it up so it could dry, but be out of the way."
4,not too bad,"the sling is very strong, great support for baby, the bathtub seems durable and is sturdy. the only thing bad about this tub is the horizontal width could have been a little more wider so getting water will be easier hence the reason why i give 4 stars other than that great tub"
5,Best Baby Tub Ever!,"This tub is the absolute best there is! My baby is 6 months old and I have enjoyed using this tub every day. The infant sling is sturdy and detachable. It is great for use in the bathroom tub or any other level space.THE GOOD- adjustable, sturdy sling for infants- storage compartment (used for soap, toys, shampoo, etc.)- no-slip bottom- durable and can be used for years- no leak water valve.- wipe clean surfaceTHE BAD- It does everything right except file my taxes and clean my home :)"
3,Good For Smaller Babies,"We used this tub for our son until he was 5 1/2 months old, even though it states they can use it up until toddler age. The tub worked great when he was younger however since we've had to turn him around in the tub (the infant and toddler side of the tub) there is a ledge in the middle of the tub and it crunches his male parts. I would only recommend this tub for girls if you plan to keep it for a very long time. It did work great though when he was a little baby."
5,We love bath time!,"My daughter loves her baths more and more each day. I love the padded side and how it allows for her to be at an angle when sitting in the tub. It fits perfectly in a standard kitchen sink. Also, I believe that the plug fades to a light blue or white color if the water is too hot. I don't rely on that anymore, as she likes her baths a little on the warmer side. None the less for a new parent, it was a nice feature to have."
3,"Great for newborns, terrible for older babies","This tub worked wonderfuly for us for the first four months. We first used the sling, and then the sloped position for our son. However, our son is now five months old and the tub no longer works for us. The sloped position is uncomfortable for him as he struggles to sit up. The straight ""toddler"" side doesn't work either because it has him almost folded in half trying to sit in it. I am going to save the tub for any future children, but now have to find something else to bathe my five month old in."
5,A MUST HAVE!...,"I got the First Years 4 stage bathtub at my baby shower and I didn't really like it. As soon as he could be submerged he would slide and wriggle all around the tub. It didn't hold much water and he could splash most of it out anyway. The adjustable leg broke after a few uses. I just got this tub and used it for the first time today and Zach and I both LOVE IT! It's sturdy, holds lots of water, has the handy butt bump to help him sit up and it's not at all slippery where his little back lies. I HIGHLY recommend this to any new parent, I wish I had got it from the start![.]"
5,Wonderful tub!,This tub has been wonderful...has worked great from newborn to still using it with my 9 month old and have plenty of time to use it with my guy.
5,best bathtub ever!,"We got this bathtub when my first child was born. Now, 7 1/2 years and 4 children later, we are still using this bathtub and absolutely loving it! It works so well for newborns and we are still using it now for our 12 month old twins (1 at a time of course)."
1,"Drain Leaks, only use in tub or sink","We had been using the Summer Infant fold away tub for the past few months, but while convenient and small, we've found that our 3 month old is no longer comfortable in it. So upon a few recommendations and reviews we bought the First Years Infant to Toddler tub. Only thing though is that we give him baths on his changing table, since it's very hard on our backs to do in a bath tub and our sink is too small. When I put water in the tub, there's a pretty bad leak that comes from the drain area underneath. We returned it (purchased at Babies R Us) for another, thinking we had a defective one. Second one had the same exact issue. It's' a shame since it doesn't seem that hard to make a tub with a drain that seals better (the fold-away we have is fine in that regard). So while the little froggy drain is cute, it doesn't work. So we're going to have return this one again and find a tub that is comfortable and can hold water properly."
3,Great for older infants/toddlers,"Our daughter is 9 months old and the First Years's tub is the best place we have tried for bath time. The grip on the seat helps our daughter to stay upright -- even when she is all slippery from being soapy. This was a big concern for us with the ""adult"" tub or the kitchen sink.I also like how the bottom of the tub has ""feet"" that allow it to perch steadily on my sink basin while I give my daughter a bath. It's so much nicer to be able to stand and give her a bath than to try to kneel on the bathroom floor!"
3,hammock is great...tub is ok,"We loved the hammock feature of this tub. It is wonderful for small babies (up to 15 lbs, I think). But when we started just using the tub, I find it to be ok at best. I like that there is two incline levels, but our baby just slips down the lesser incline and seems to just push herself forward at the other end into the water. It almost seems easier to lay her in the tub with some towels underneath. But I can't complain about the hammock... that alone was worth the purchase."
2,not as great as I thought!,"The hammock was a waiste! Tried to use it, threw it out. The seat is not deep enough, my 4 months old is not even close to being covered by water, when he's on the ""infant side"", but the other side is too upright for babies that already sit with no problems. I don't know if that actually works, he's not big enough yet. The tub doesn't really fit in either single or double sinks, we've tried both.I wish I knew which tub is better, so I could get it!"
1,We Hated This Tub!!!!,"my son was never comfortable in this tub. even in the sling, he would slide past the little ledge made to keep him upright. he'd end up with the plastic ledge halfway up his back. and then when he got a little bigger and we tried to use the seat...he'd slip past the ledge even worse. i do NOT recommend that anyone get this tub...it's not worth the pain and trouble. for our next child i'm going to get the safer bather...it has great reviews!!!"
1,not easy to clean,"there are many small corners in the this tub, which make it is hard to clean. I don't like the design."
3,"Good up to a year, but terrible plug","We've just transitioned our baby into a bigger baby tub...not quite ready to put her in the big tub, and this tub is now too small for her. But it was a perfect size when she was a newborn - I used the sling at first, and then the 'newborn' end - and up to around 10 months we felt comfortable with it. So yes, it's a good tub for a young baby. Not for a toddler, although it's supposed to be for that age range too - in fact the baby is cramped in there as she gets bigger and it's hard to get into her folds and clean her!My main complaint is the plug. We have to take a large wooden spoon and really shove hard to get the plug to go in. It's a big pain, especially when you're alone bathing the baby and have enough to organize without messing around with that. Sometimes I thought it was in properly and it wasn't..had to fill it again, after I had the baby all ready for bathing."
5,PERFECT TUB!,"I love this tub. The hamic was great when he had his umbilical cord still. Now that it has fallen off, the seat is great. It puts him at just the right angle and even though he can't sit up in his own, it holds him up perfect."
5,I love this tub!,This tub works great! I've used it since my daughter's umbilical cord fell off. It fits perfectly in the sink - the temperature drain plug is fantastic - the tub drains quickly & the water stays warm throughout the bath - great tub!
2,Okay while it lasted.,"This seat was great for the first several months. Now that my daughter is 25 inches and 15 pounds at 3 months old, the tub is way to small for her. No matter how I put her in it, her feet hit the opposite side. She is an active kicker and has stubbed her toes several times. It was okay while it lasted. Though she constantly slid down, the temp sensitive plug is useless, and the newborn sling that comes with it stretches to tight and makes it impossible to use without baby flipping out."
5,Buy a tub thermometer too,"As most of the other reviews said, this is a great tub. Only thing I have to add is that you should also buy a tub thermometer. The rubber stopper on the tub is supposed to change color if the water is too hot for baby-but the water has to be way too hot before it changes noticeably (it does change slightly, but you can't tell through the water). Otherwise, this tub has been perfect for us."
1,THIS TUB HAS SOME UNSAFE FEATURES!!,"We loved this tub when our baby was newborn ... but as she started moving around in the bath and kicking her feet, she would get them stuck in the channels on the side of the tub where the plastic raises to create a seat. We have to stuff wash clothes down in the channels by the seat to keep her from getting her feet stuck."
5,A great tub,"My baby girl and I just love this tub. The ""hammock"" like insert safely cradled her when she was a newborn, making her feel safe and secure. She loved taking a bath from day one. When she grew out of the hammock, the recline side of the tub allowed for a comfortable transition to ""sitting"" in the tub. Now that she's a very busy 9 month old the sitting upright side allows her to safely sit up on her own and play and splash without her little bum slipping out from underneath her. She's 21 pounds and still fits well in this tub and will probably use it until she's one year old. Both of my sisters had this tub with their babies, and we all loved it. It was one of the first baby items we all went out and bought."
1,Not a comfortable tub for an infant at all,"This tub had so many people saying good things about it and I have no idea why. The suspension net is a horrible idea. Your infant is wet and yet up in the air so he/she gets so cold it isn't funny. Then I thought well maybe my baby will grow into it so I kept it and waited and tried it again at 5 months old. And he can't stand it! The way this tub is designed is increadibly uncomfortable for him. He arches his back and screems the whole time he is in it. I found out there are a lot of none plastic tubs that are a lot better! The ""MOTHERS TOUCH LARGE COMFORT BATHER"" Is ALOT MORE COMFORTABLE FOR YOUR CHILD! My Advice, STAY AWAY FROM PLASTIC TUBS!"
1,not good for a active baby,I bought this tub because of the great 4 1/2 star review. I wish I researched better. The only time it came in handy was the hammock when he was a newborn. All he does since he was like 1 1/2-2 months old is kicked so that he can stretch out in the water. This causes the stupid divider to be jammed up him back. I can't keep him sitting up in it no matter how many times during one bath I try. I can't wait till he can fully sit up all the way(he almost can) just so I can buy the seat you sit them in. I will not be using this tub with my next child.
1,Only $17.98 at walmart!,"For the exactly same thing, walmart only sells for $17.98.I dont have issue with the tub, shop at walmart!!"
1,Pass on this one....,"This bathtub does not provide the type of security a newborn baby needs when bathing. I always needed another pair of hands to hold my baby steady while I bathed him. When he finally got a little bigger, I could bathe the baby myself, but he would slip all the time, despite the non-slip surface! I have given up on this bathtub and have moved on to another product and my baby is much happier."
3,Waste of Money!,I'm sure this is a great tub if you were to use it. We never did. Baby slip around too much.
5,a perfect tub,We all love this tub! My daughter really enjoys her bath and both me and my husband find it easy to bathe her. The sling keeps her in place and I love that feature. I would definitely recommend this tub to new parents!
5,Love this tub,This is a really great tub! My sone has already grown out of the sling...but the tub is even better without it! We would never choose another tub!!
2,Not good for a bigger baby...,"This tub was great while my baby was very little and I was using the net. But now that she is 4 months old and is in the reclining part of the tub, she slips and slides and her bottom ends up on TOP of the bump that is in the middle of the tub. I truly do not feel this is a very safe tub as it does not keep the baby in a safe position. Also, the reclining section seems to be designed too small. My baby is on the bigger side (16 pounds at 4 months) and does not fit the reclining section any more. But she is not sitting up yet, so I cannot place her on the sitting-up side. I have had to go out and buy another tub that fits her better and is safer for her."
4,Great tub for a while...,"I loved this tub for my baby when she was newborn. The hammock was perfect. It also fits on other baby tubs. We gave it to my sister when her baby was born. The biggest complaint I have is the ""hump"" in the middle of the tub. My ""little girl"" is BIG (5 months). She's tall and chunky. She doesn't sit up well yet so we are still using the reclined side and she is so long that she scoots over the hump and gets very uncomfortable. Other than that it has been a wonderful tub, but I would reconsider if you have a big baby."
4,A not bad product,"I guess you've read all the pros of this product. The bigges con for me is it accumulate too much water at various places. There is a plug at the bottom, but it cannot drain all the water if you turn the tub upside down. Besides that, it's a little smaller for baby over six months."
4,Perfect tub for infants,"This tub was awesome when my son was a newborn. I loved the mesh hammock, it made even a nervous first-timer feel confident. The angle of the infant side is great. This tub made bathing a baby alone really easy. I also liked the area opposite the green padding that holds shampoo, etc. My son is now 5 1/2 months and we just quit using this tub. He still fits but is now splashing around so much that we moved up to the munchkin duck tub, which he loves."
3,Slip Pads Are Falling Off,"The non-slip pads on this tub are coming off. I've only had this for less than three months. They don't really help anyways. The sling was good, but I had issues with my baby's bottom hitting the middle separator. Plus, he stayed cold and it made him mad."
3,"great for infants, but not for more grown babies","I got this as a baby shower gift from my friend. I really liked it when my daughter was a newborn. This item was great for a little while. I never really used the sling with her so that was kind of pointless. However, when she learn to sit up she no longer like being in the laydown tub. She enjoyed in a bath tub more when she could play and move around in the water . So I decided to get her a safety first chair for the bath tub and she loves it! So yea, this might be good for newborns but not for more grown babies"
3,Not easy to store,"We bought the ""PUJ"" tub for our LO. She was born 5# and at 7 months is only 15#. LOVED the PUJ. Can't say enough good about it. But she has finally outgrown it. This tub is fine, I'm sure. But she doesn't have a dedicated bathroom so unless we want to store it against the wall, I don't have a good place to keep it when she's not in the bath. Sorry, this one went back."
4,Good tub,This is the second tub I've had. This one is better than the last (about 12 years ago). It has the baby net thing that helps hold a newborn in place. I still support his head with my hand (at 5 weeks old). The rubber mat helps the tub walls feel warmer (rather than having the baby's skin right on cold plastic). It also helps keep baby from slipping and adds a little padding. The end has a cubby thats great for holding baby wash and washcloths. The drain plugs shut and opens easily. It fits perfectly in my sink and is easy to empty.
2,Good for newborns (sling),"We had this tub for our first baby. We loved it when we had the sling in it when he was very little. He fit perfect and it was easy to fill up and have on a counter at our level. However, once he got too big for the sling, we thought the tub was just a huge pain. He would constantly slide down, and ALWAYS would slide to the slide so his head would fall off the main head rest part. We were adjusting him it seemed like every other minute. Wouldn't recommend this tub! Plus it's big and bulky."
3,Good except for 2 things...,"The sling is genius, the bath itself can last from newborn to early toddler, but the non slip pads fell off before my baby was even out of the sling. And the most annoying part was cleaning it. You can't tell from the picture but there are 4 tiny, but deep crevices in the corners of the hard plastic tub that are impossible to scrub if you want to give this tub a good cleaning. I would try to shove a cloth with cleaner down them like the neck of a water bottle, but I still don't feel it got clean. The plastic tub design could easily have been made simpler to avoid this."
3,"Love this tub for newborns, but horrible for infant","I enjoy using this tub when the baby was born. It fit's nicely in a standard kitchen sink . My son is very active with his feed and loves the water( he is now 4 month old). The reason why I gave only 3 stars is that the head cushion is not high enough, it's end appr. in the center of babies head. The support b/w the legs is not high enough. He always push himself up and slides down into the water. I constantly have to repostion him. There is no side support either so he slides back and forth too. I was satisfied in the beginning, but it's definetly not for bigger babies. I bought the Eurotub and it's spacy for their leg, has side support and b/w legs is much higher too."
5,Better than the rest...,"I recently bought this bath tub for my 3 month old. We had a hand me down tub that worked ok but my son outgrew the tub.So I was looking for something that would be comfortable for my son and be useful as he grew. Well needless to say, this was the tub we chose and it was a great pick. I was unable to use the ""hammock"" for the newborn stage, but it looks really comfortable. I'll have to wait for the next baby to see if it works."
5,I LOVE THIS TUB!,We used this for the first time today for our son's first bath. What a great little tub.Pros:1. It was very easy to attach the sling to the tub.2. The sling made bathing a newborn much easier for one person.3. Neat compartment on the tub to hold your washcloth soap and shampoo.Cons:1. NONE!
4,Great tub,The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is a little small and difficult to drain completely due to two little holes on the sides. Besides these issues I found this to be a lifesaver. I wasn't taught how to bathe my son at the hospital (!!!) so I was really uncertain and afraid. The hammock feature put me at ease because it cradled him (he is really big and really long so this is also good for big newborns) and allowed me the freedom to clean him without worrying about him slipping or sliding. Now that he can sit up with help he leans against the infant side and enjoys his baths. I just wish it were a little wider. My plug did change color when the water was too hot but it did take a while. My take on this is to always check it to see how you feel anyway and have a backup like a rubber ducky that checks the temperature too.
2,Do you need a bath tub?,This tub is ok. The only thing is babies are happier when they take bath with you on your shoulder or lap in shower. So even I bought it i used only two times. Its more comfortable to handle the baby yourself than in the tub.
2,Best for left-handed parents,"This tub only fits on the right side of my double sink, because the ""gripper"" meant to fit over the sink separator is on the backrest end of the tub. This means that the baby faces to the right, and the tub covers the entire right side of the sink. You have to use the left side of your sink for clean rinse water, but how are you supposed to reach over there if you are right-handed? Drives me crazy. I'm right-handed, so I'd like the tub to fit on the left side of my double sink, so I could fill the right side of the sink with rinse water. This way I could stabilize the baby with my left hand while using my right hand to wash/rinse him. This tub would be perfect for a left-handed person, but I hate it."
1,This tub has been thrown in the trash,"For my first child, I used a Safety 1st tub (which has its issues, too, but was for the most part pretty good). We had to purchase a new one for our second child and this was the only brand available at the store where we did our baby shopping.I found the sling to be difficult to adjust, and it didn't seem to allow our baby to be in the water while being bathed - he was sort of suspended above it. Once he became too big for the sling, I moved him to the tub itself and found the shape of it to be completely useless. I don't understand how the manufacturer could expect so many different sizes of babies to fit in that shape - he pushed up on the end of the tub with his feet, and it was difficult to keep a good grip on him while bathing him because the tub did nothing to help hold him up. After a few attempts at using the tub, I threw it out and went straight to the store to get the Safety 1st tub. Now I remember why I like it so much."
5,GREAT TUB !!!!,"I have tried a few other tubs, and nothing compares. This has lots of space and it's perfect for newborns to lie back, and then for older babies to sit up. I love the hump in the middle, it stops the baby from sliding down to the end of the tub, which must be really uncomfortable for them. I love this, and would recommend it to anyone !! :)"
4,Very nice tub,"This tub is great! The mesh sling is very helpful for holding a small slippery baby. The only thing I don't like about it is that when the sling gets wet, the material is very cool to the touch. This makes it uncomfertable for my son."
5,quite simply a perfect product,"I read all the reviews before I decided on this tub. First, the thing costs so little, why not upgrade from the sink, especially if the baby will be more comfortable which was definitely the case with my little one. And the non skid material works pretty well too. Sometimes if I need to let go of her for a second(she's 12 weeks now) I know she's not going anywhere. I went on a trip and I didn't bring the tub and bathtime was horrible with all the soapy squirming and I knew the sink was just not comfortable like her tub. I have been using this since her umbilical fell off. And it must be pretty popular because when I went to get one, there were none left! You can't go wrong with this tub. I love it and my daughter loves it. I think it has made bathtime better for both of us and I would recommend it to anyone."
3,It's ok for what it is but there are design flaws,"The hollow legs that create the openings inside the tub are hard to clean. The tub is light. If not filled up with water, the baby can flip out easily. After a few months, the rubber piece on the bottom of the tub started coming off (you can see it on the second picture, the one without the infant insert, there are two of them, they are darker color than the rest of the tub).Otherwise, it is OK, we've been using this tub since we first got home. We only used the infant insert for sponge baths before the belly button dried up but it was pretty useful for a few days. So despite numerous issues, I gave it 3 stars because it is convenient to use and cheap, which makes it easy to replace if necessary."
2,Only good for newborn stages,"After baby starts moving more and wanting to splash.. this tub is worthless. The bump in the middle that is suppose to hold baby in seeted position is worthless, they slide them selves right over it so it is then digging in their little backs. Also, it's not very slip resitant after your done with the hammock portion (wich starts to smell bad even rung & hung to dry) They grow so fast, don't waste you money on this tub.. I'm currently looking for another for my almost 6moth old son... Any ideas would be appreciated!"
4,Cute and work great!,"Bought this for my friends baby shower, Looks cute and it seems to work great my friend is very happy with this item."
5,Perfect for the first 6 months or so,This was a great getting started tub. It fit in the sink perfectly which made bath time at waist level so much easier on everyone. Even once moving from the sink to the tub we continued to use this for a while. Faster to fill and easier to keep the little one siting up.
5,Reviews were bang on ...,"Excellent product and my new-born is getting baths on a regular basis in this tub. Good design especially the sling, expedites the whole process vastly.Also hard to beat Amazon's cost effectiveness, cheaper than at Target or BabiesRUs. Value for money..."
3,Limited Usage - OK product,"I purchased this bathtub for my newborn baby. We didn't have a detachable showerhead for the faucet so it wasn't easy to wash his hair. I ended up using a round plastic large bowl, wide and deep enough to contain an almost 9 lb baby in. Eventually we put him in this tub at about 11 lbs with the sling and he really enjoyed dipping his feet in the water and he liked bath time. The sling works great though my baby quickly outgrew that. Betweeen 1.5 and 3 months this tub was actually perfect. At 4 months without the use of the sling, he seemed awkward and cramped and appeared to be uncomfortable. I recently switched to the Eurobath which is perfect for him at 5 months and almost 15 lbs. This tub worked well but only lasted for a little while. The Eurobath is perfect for him now, though I don't think it would be good for him if he was smaller. I would buy this tub again and will use it for my next baby."
3,Great for (small) infants.............,"This tub seemed excellent for my preemie baby girl. The removable hammock really was a terrific and secure way to bathe her quickly and easily. My daughter HATED taking a bath until she was 6 mths old, so we usually had a struggle. After she outgrew the hammock, it was time to move on to a bath seat. This tub is strangely designed in my opinion. Not much room for baby to play and that bump in the middle tends to get in the way. The tub has a positive side, but overall, I wouldnt waste the money."
5,Great tub for the money!,"This tub is GREAT. It was inexpensive but it has great features. It fits right into a double kitchen sink; it has a plug in the bottom for easy draining. The hammock that comes with it is great when they need to be sponge bathed. The newborn side is great too. He is only 10 weeks old so we haven't tried the toddler side yet, but I'm sure it will be wonderful too"
4,Great while the baby is small,"The tub is wonderful for a newborn, the net really came in handy. Now that he's 7 months, however, he doesn't really fit comfortably, so I had to get another larger tub."
2,get something else,"This tub works in our kitchen sink, which is why we chose it. However, the sling that holds the baby does NOT last long... and our baby is very small... 12.5 lbs at 4 mos. She weighs down the sling and rubs her back against the hump in the middle. SO we tried it without the sling and she slips over the hump in the tub. I have to hold her in the tub with one hand while bathing her with the other. NOT IDEAL. There are much better options out there. We have gotten the Summer Infant Baby Bather and it is SO SO much better. The only negative is that you have to fill the entire tub, but so worth it compared to this tub. This tub was a waste of money for us."
1,Wish I would have bought a different tub...,"My husband and I purchased this bath at Target because it was on sale for $15. At first I was excited but after using it for a month I'm pretty disappointed. The wedge in the middle of the tub that is suppose to support the baby's bum makes washing my 3 and 1/2 month old son pretty difficult. His feet already reach the other side of the tub so I don't see us using it much longer. We never used the sling either because our son would have barely touched the water in it.UPDATE: I didn't like this bath before but now I hate it even more. It's been about a month since I reviewed this and my son is now 4 1/2 months old, about 16 pounds and 24 inches long. He has become too big for the infant side of the tube, his back and bum can't sit comfortably on the wedge/bump in the middle of the tub and he can't sit up yet so the todler side is a no go."
2,Bad-designed baby tub,"The productThe First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Bluewas definitely something that I didn't find very useful. The tub is fairly small, and the baby can fit in there for (just) a couple of months. When he grew bigger that 22 inches there was not so much room for the water, which would eventually end on the floor. Another problem is the ""seat"" (a piece of plastic stuck in the middle of the tub that would serve as a baby-bottom holder); it makes the washing process extremely difficult, as there is not enough space to fit a hand behind the back of the baby. Last, the net depicted in the picture is nice, but never used, as the baby would probably never touch the water.Basically, it is not the tub that we wanted, and we had to find other solutions to wash the baby."
5,Great Tub,"My son has been using this tub since he was one week old and I have loved it. The cradle was wonderful for him to just relax and get a bath, its easy to empty and easy to clean. He's now 7 months old and in the 95th percentile and still fits in the tub. He now sits in it and plays and can still stretch his legs out. I love this tub!"
4,Great for newborns,"My son just loves his baths. When he was a newborn the sling was perfect. It dips down just far enough for him to be in the water but keeps his cord dry and easy to sponge bath. Now that my son is older (4 months) I'm going to have to go to another tub. My son is long (already 27 inches) and so he's been kicking himself out of the incline side for a while now, and he's not quite ready for the toddler side. All in all I really enjoy this tub. It is very easy to fill and drain with one hand (which is about all you will have). Other tubs I encountered the incline is just too steep and my son just hates them."
2,CAN ONLY BE USED TEMPORARILY,"I purchased this item when I was pregnant with my son. Once my son was 4-5 months old, this tub had to go! He would sit up and almost flip the thing over. Now he is 9 months old and I had to purchase another tub already. I put him in it just to see what he would do; HE LITERALLY SAT UP AND ALMOST RAISED OUT. I am upset because he is now 9 months and I have to purchase another tube. I think the 4 in 1 is what I should have purchased in the beginning. This tub has not support for any baby more than 3 months old."
5,A Great Baby Tub,"We weren't sure what to get when I was pregnant since this is our first baby, but this seemed like a good idea. We are so glad we chose this tub. It fits perfectly in the kitchen sink. The newborn sling is great, especially since our baby was only 5 1/2 pounds when she was born and would have gotten lost in the tub without it. Once she got bigger, and could hold her head up, we took the sling out and used the tub in one direction. Now that she can sit up on her own, she sits in the tub in the other direction, so it has grown with her. There is padding on the bottom to help prevent slipping, and the plug changes color if the water is too hot. I know other mommies who have stated that they wished they had gotten this tub instead because of all these features."
2,Not impressed as much as others,"We have had this tub since my son was born. We used the sling at first and were pleased with it. However, my son quickly outgrew it and we switched to the reclining infant side of the tub. This is when the disappointment started. He doesn't stay in the seat. His bum/back is constantly floating up and he slides down. He requires constant repositioning. Now he is 5mo and he doesn't have enough room to kick and splash since his feet are up against the toddler end of the tub most of the time and his arms hit the edges. Unfortunately, he can't use the toddler end either since he cannot sit up on his own. He used to enjoy his baths much more than now but we are at a loss for what to do."
2,Mom of a 7 month old,This tub was so great when our daughter was small but now that she is getting bigger this tub is too small for her. She wants room to splash and kick and this tub is too cramped. We give her baths in the regular tub now. Now she has all the room she needs. When she was a newborn though it was wonderful but if you're looking for something that your baby can use until they are older I would not recommend this one. If you're looking for something that is less expensive and you can use until they are big enough to use the real tub I would recommend this one.
2,"Good for newborns, but that's it!","We loved this tub when we first got it. Our son fit well in the sling as a newborn and it was easy and comfortable to bathe him. At 11 lbs, 23 in., his bottom was touching the bump on the tub and his knees were bent and feet touched the other end of the tub. We tightened the sling so his bottom wouldn't touch, but found that it was too tight and he nearly flipped out of it. We decided to just put him in the tub on the infant side. He looks very uncomfortable, the bottom part is not padded, his legs are bent up too far and we have to hold him while we bathe him.This tub slides all over in the bathtub but it does fit very well in the sink. We are now looking for a new more suitable tub!"
2,Not great,"I registered for this tub because I thought the sling would make it more versatile as far as fitting various sizes. Unfortunately we haven't found it to be very useful for our son - perhaps because he is big & tall for his age (2.5 months, 14 lbs, 25 inches long). When in the sling, the big ridge in the middle of the tub jabs up into his back. I would like for there to be some sort of head cradle in the tub, but the head area is completely flat, so without the sling his head and torso always slump over to the side unless I constantly hold him up. This makes it difficult for one person to bathe him. At two months old he seemed too long for the tub because when his bottom was in the cradle his head almost hung off the back. Would probably work for older baby of same size w/ more head control. Looking for a different tub for my baby."
5,Toddler Tub with Sling-Pink,"This was purchased as a gift for my Granddaughter. The baby has not arrived as yet, but from observing the tub I can honestly say it looks amazing. I was not fortunate enough, when raising my children, to have the opportunity to use this useful tub."
4,"""awesome & very functional tub""!","We received this tub as a gift & was so happy for it! It's so easy to set it up in a single/double sink & the sling that comes w/ it is so helpful when baby is still newborn or just giving a sponge bath. I used the tub w/ the sling/cradle w/ our baby girl few x's already & it helps a lot to keep her belly button cord dry before it falls off. This tub is very durable & no assebly is needed. For those moms out there, this is a +++++ & highly recommended to your baby shower lists!!!"
5,Great tub - goes the distance!,"My daughter used this tub right from birth and it is great! My mom bought her the 4-in-1 tub to have at her house, but my daughter cried in that one (it is just not comfortable, etc). My daughter was able to use this tub until she was well over a year old. It also fit well in our odd-shaped kitchen sink. It is the tub to have!"
4,there are only 2 features i didn't like...,"I picked this for my daughter... the only 2 things I didn't like are1) the ""hammock"" for a newborn hangs to high, it was ackward for her as a new born, it didn't cradle her enough she she startled at every little movement.2) it does NOT fit every sink! It was to wide for my sink so we had to use it on the counter top. Plus the drain plug is right in the middle of the base, this made it difficult to drain from the counter,Otherwise this worked well once she was big enough to prop on the infant side, the hump/bump in the middle kept her bottom in place. Once she could sit alittle we moved to the other side so she could sit and splash. She is tall, so she out grew it at about by 9 months old plus she began trying to standup in it.I still recommend this one because of the shape of the bottom is the most convent for a 1 month old to a 8 mo old"
4,happy mommy,"I love this tub! I only used the newborn sling a few times, but it sure came in handy in the beginning. My son is five months old now and this tub is almost perfect! He wiggles a lot and sometimes slides down so I have to keep propping him back up but I suppose the tub isn't to blame for that. I think if it had something grippy on the hump in the center then maybe he couldn't slide so easily. The tub is great though and in comparison to other tubs it's actually much safer for baby."
2,Horrible,"When I was using the sling for the baby, it was fine. When she outgrew the sling, she would slide around. It was very difficult to use as a ""toddler tub"". I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,not for big babies,"My son was 9lbs 11.2oz at birth an 22inches long. This tub is NOT for big babies, he's only 5 months and has out grown it already.There's no way this tub can convert to an toddler tub,evey time my son sit's up, he end's up squishing him self on the plastic part in the middle. I was givn this tub as a shower gift and now im wishing I had returned it and gotten something else."
3,sling feature rocks!,"i registered for this tub and it's good but not AS good as i had expected it to be. the sling feature is most useful for tiny babies who have no control over their little necks. it's good to keep the baby sitting in a tub filled with water and then the sling can be put on for the washing and shampooing. the no-slip feature [the green thing in the tub] should be extended to the base where the bottom rests because my daughter keeps slipping down as bathtime progresses. so i keep a towel in with her when she's sitting in the bath. i used a towel for the sling in the beginning as well because the sling was too cold for her skin, but stopped using it after about a month when her skin became more susceptible to the cold."
5,My baby love the tub,This is a great tub. My 3 month son loves it. It's very comfortable and easy to use. Highly recommended!
3,worked good till baby learned that bathtime was fun....,"This bathtub was fine when she was first born. I never really liked the sling part, only used it once since it seemed flimsy (especially if your baby doesn't lay completely still, which rarely happens at bathtime!!) She did better in the reclined part. But when she got to be about 3 months old and learned that bathtime was fun, anytime she would start moving she would slide right over the hump that is supposed to keep them above the water. Several times I have had to grab her really quick before she would ""go under"". Now I have to have one hand on her bumm at all times...really annoying when you are trying to wash any part of her. I tried to put her on the toddler side, but she hasn't mastered unasissted seating yet, so she falls left or right. I won't be using it anymore!!!"
4,GREAT SEAT BUT CANT LAST TOO LONG,"I love this seat! When I brought my 6 lb. baby boy home from the hospital he was able to fit into the cradle right away. He grew out of that in about 5 weeks and now he is sitting on the infant side of the tub. This tub fits perfectly into my single sink, but baby LOVES to splash so I've been putting it in my tub.The only downside to this is that my son is only 3 1/2 mos. old, 25 in., 15 lbs and barely fits in here anymore. I dont see him using this thing for more than 2 more mos...at which point I will have to move to a bigger seat I guess.Overall great seat, great price!"
3,Good for a while,"This tub was nice for the first 5 months. We used it in the kitchen sink and then in the bathtub. The mesh hammock was perfect for when she was newborn. The infant side was great after that. The 'toddler' side I don't know about. After she was sitting up on her own it was hard to bath her in it on either side. We got a new tub-the big ducky inflateable one available at target. So it lasted for 5 months which is good for the price, but not beyond that"
5,Great tub!,"I had another tub at first and bathtime was a nightmare. My little one cried the entire time and my back ached from bending over. I decided to buy this tub and the crying stopped immediately! Now he gets a bath every night before bed and it's one of the happiest times of the day. The hammock works great, I haven't had trouble with mildew and the plug temp feature has worked for me, unlike some other reviewers. Definitely well worth the money."
5,Bir klasik !! - Sari Odanin Esrari,"Harika arkada$lar, tek kelimeyle harika. Son sayfaya kadar sizi iinde tutabilen bir kitap. Olaylarin bi aiklamasi olabilecegini dü$ünmüyosunuz bile. kitabin sonuna kadar meraktan atlamazsaniz gerekten ok $a$iracaksiniz. (Duydunuz mu adnan & inci ?)"
4,Some days you just can't get rid of an old TV show.,"Seeing as I'm a huge Bat-Fan (hence the name), I was immensely entertained by this here Reunion flick. The chemistry between Adam & Burt is still as strong as it was back in the 60's, and the ""flashback"" cuts are pretty comical sometimes. Not the best Batman movie ever, but it's cool to have if you love the old TV show like me."
5,An open Request,"To the owners of the t.v. series starring adam west and burt ward: Please, please put the show on dvd soon, so we can share this wonderful show with our children before they grow up. It was done so well, good clean humor and it's obvious the actors are enjoying making the show. I will pre-order the moment you decide to release."
4,A Bat-Documentry with a story line,"Growing up in the 60's and watching Batman series, which I knew was corny, campy but cool, this movie is sort of a story, plot documentry using flashbacks that Adam West & Burt Ward have throughout the movie. I enjoyed it very much, and now know that the dynamic duo were also dynamic womanizers. This is a great movie for anyone who grew up watching the Batman episodes with a towel cape around his or her neck. The actors who portray the dynamic duo in the flashbacks are dead ringers as well. Delightfully done !."
2,"Made for TV, but not for any other good reason","I wish I could like this. It came from the folks who did the ""Gilligan's Island"" docu-spoof which was good fun.But this one is so loosely developed, it just drags on with few real laughs. It's got the feel of a community theater Halloween party, there's a cheapness to the production, and the two aged leads look like they're just waiting fo rhteir check.The original ""Batman"" sit-com of the 60s was always funny and entertaining. This isn't, and it's really too bad."
1,Very Disappointing,"If you are an avid Adam West or Burt Ward fan this is the video for you. If you are a fan of the old Batman and Robin series that you watched as a kid and would like to see old episodes, don't buy. It is very disappointing to see Batman and Robin as they are now riding in the Batmobile. That is a video that we can do without."
4,Adam West : Batman -Return to the Bat Cave,Ordered as a gift for a friend who loves anything Batman. I met Mr. West at one of the conventions in Dallas and was very impressed with him (and his agent whom I talked to for 30 minutes without knowing who he was!) My friend was thrilled when his gift showed up at his house.
5,Outstanding,"Any fan of the classic Batman of the sixties will love this. This is the funny/campy batman, not the serious version it was based on (in my opinion the world is serious enough already and needs more comedy). Wonderful stuff, you can read the synopsis elsewhere, but it's got my 5 stars."
4,More scare less gore,Aside from making a film frightening they did it without blood and gore. The pace of the film was good and the acting and direction was exceptional. I seen so many films on the Sci-Fi channel that just wouldn't compare to the quality of this production. I highly recommend this film.
5,Love it,Prior to this I was using an OXO bottle opener. I had to worry about breaking the lip of bottles with the OXO. Not with this one though. It opens bottles easily and cleanly every time. Great product.
5,It works,"This is a great bottle opener, its exactly like the ones that I have seen bartenders use, it makes opening bottles super easy, much easier than the 'hook' style openers on some pocket knives and can openers."
3,Disappointing...,"The 5 star reviews and description suggested this was very heavy duty and professional grade. At first blush, it doesn't seem so. The metal is thinner than expected and has some flex. I've seen a Bud opener (given to distributors?) that is more substantial, stronger, and has a bit of a cool factor. I've seen a very old but new looking opener that is super strong and heavy (iron?)--- built for a lifetime.So, this seems ordinary and even a bit cheaply made. I'm not sure if it will wear out or not. Yes, it's cheap but that's not the point. Moreover, regular shipping is more than the price of the item.Well, my 2 cents :-).(Feel free to enlighten me.)"
5,Works great! fun to use! sturdy,"it opens bottles. it does it well. it is easy to use, comfortable and sturdy. I bought two. took some earth magents and stuck them to two different fridges. I would get again, but I think these will last for a while. what else is there to say? I like to spin them around my fingers. fun. :-)"
5,Works great!,"I was looking for a bottle opener that didn't ""slip"" on certain caps, and this one fit the bill. It isn't the prettiest bottle opener, but it makes up for it with function. It opens bottles with ease. The rubber coating makes it easy on your hands for the hard to open bottles. I would recommend this opener to anyone."
1,Dave's right ladies and gents.,"And here I thought that the reviewer above had just grabbed the short straw. Turns out I've got the exact same problem. The TV, right out of the box mind you, does not turn on. It's not that it has no picture. It just literally doesn't turn on. Philips hasn't returned any emails, and the local shop (which is 40 odd miles away) doesn't even know where to start with this.Stay away from this product. It's cursed."
5,Vince Gill Sings My Heart,"I love Vince Gill's music. His sweet, mellow vocals embrace you and take you on a journey of heart and soul. His musical versatility makes him a singer for all seasons. I highly recommend ""High Lonesome Sound""!"
1,Damaged,"I recieved this product in the mail and it didn't work. The case was broken, so it fell out of the package.I ended up throwing it away."
5,Wife is thrilled,This was a Christmas present. My wife was thrilled. I bought Vince Gill tickets for Lakeland Florida and put them in the case. Good move.
1,Looks pretty but is pretty unusable,"I was given this cadle as a gift this Christmas and I already know that I will never use it again. Right out of the box they look great but they are very hard to use. The wax is not flexible and it needs to be flexible to maneuver into the awkward clamp. So the wax breaks up and it looks awful. I tried to use a lighter to soften the wax and now there are black smudges, drip marks, and it's all distorted.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON""T BUY THESE CANDLES UNLESS THEY ARE GOING TO ONLY BE FOR DECORATION."
4,Interesting candle,"Don't buy this product if you think the wax rope is going to act like real rope. It is wax and does take some use getting use to. The rope can be moved and shaped but it takes a little time to do it. It did not break trying to get the wax to go from circular to straight. Mine was a 100 hour version so it have two cylinders of wax. This made it more difficult then the 60 hour version.Candle by the Hour, 60-hour Beeswax CandleJust be patient in your endevor to use the candle. It is not plug and play. But it is more intersting then the plain old pillar ones."
2,Buyer Beware!,"Buyer Beware! This image is NOT what you will receive!You will recieve, in a box with this image on it, the ""other"" product commonly displayed on the net. It will have the downturned, solid filled, clubby handles on the clamps.The importer, Eclipse Home Decor LLC is aware of this and has refused to address the issue. Good luck."
3,"Not bad, exactly...","I found this book an interesting read, but not terribly useful. I am a solitary witch and all of the rituals were designed for a coven, particularly a Wiccan coven as the rituals are in accordance with the Sabbats. They are definitely NOT ""simple"" or for ""every day"" use!Now, if you happen to be in a Wiccan coven and would like to incorporate Egyptian gods and magic into your next Sabbat ritual, then this book is perfect! Keep in mind that the rituals themselves are not exactly authentic, though. Celebration dates and other small details are different (the Egyptians placed the Birth of Horus in the middle of summer, but Almond places it at Yule), but these changes were made in order to make them more user/Wiccan-friendly.If you are a solitary witch, then the only real value I can see are the numerous hymns listed in each ritual. As far as I can tell, they consists entirely of authentic text taken from the Pyramid texts, Coffin texts, and Book of the Dead."
1,Reading everything I can,I bought this and didn't get past the first chapter. It is for a coven not a solitary wiccan. I thumbed thru it and couldn't even use the rituals as one person.
3,Quality recap of Limbo Records,"Nice little package here, two discs chock full of tunes from the Scotland label and stirred up by some reliable chaps. Fade (Chris Fortier, Neil Kolo) grab disc one, thankfully including some of their own pieces (eastern-inflected ""Heaven to Heaven"") and remixes. The Soul Surfer/Fade team up ""Slip"" proves feel-good trance with fun lyrics can be done without insulting an audience. Add in mellow M31 ""Galactica"" and dark, twisting ""I Trance You"" to complete a thoughtfully laid out set.Scott Stubbs handles the more euphoric tracks, trance which twists in every direction. That sums up Inkfish ""Agony Aunt"" quite well, also Fade's soaring ""No Resolve"" and Seafield's ""Feel Free"". The hour peaks on a high note with a series of X-Cabs remixes. Only one track grates, the high-pitch wails of Gypsy ""Varisuvia"" that goes on forever.Disc 1: 4 stars Disc 2: 3 stars"
3,Good cheap zipties,"Great assortment of cheap zipties.Would not use in automotive applications, or high stress areas.Doubt they will withstand cold"
4,Live Big Joe Williams,"This is a very good live album by Big Joe Williams. However, his live performance on the Fred McDowell/Williams Yazoo DVD is perhaps better than this. If you can find this album at a reasonable price, you should pick it up, though there is nothing on this disc that will measure up to the great Blues recordings of the 1920s and early 1930s. Big Joe Williams has tons of cds, so I look forward to checking out all of them and informing you as to which ones are keepers. This one is a keeper, but isn't up there with Furry Lewis' ""Shake 'Em On Down"" album, Buddy Moss' 1960s work, or Johnny Shines' solo Country Blues performances."
2,Boring!,"On the cover, it reads ""by Stephen King & Clive Barker"". Man, I was dissapinted when I saw this one. The stories are amazingly weak, and it wasn't scary at all. If you're a huge horror-fan, and love Stephen King and Clive Barker, this movie is interesting to have seen. But if you're looking for a good scare, than this one is last of your choice!"
3,It Was Okay,"The Stephen King story didn't translate well, it was a little too confusing, I would like to find out what was left on the edit room floor. The Clive Barker tale translated very well, the short story it was based on was just as quirky as the short film, it was the best part of the movie. Also, the transitions with Christopher Lloyd were too clumsy and irritating. Something better and smoother was needed. A definite renter but questionable buy."
2,SEARCH FOR THE BOOKS,"This film is based on two stories of two famous horror writers. Certainly the stories were frightening in the books, but they are very difficult to be filmed. One is about a biting toy that becomes alive. The other tells what can happen if our hands rebel from our body and mind and we cannot control them anymore. Instead of becoming terrifiying, many situations get hilarious. The producers should have choosen stories that fit more the movies."
2,this was by stephen king?,at first when i saw this movie at the video store it looked good. But when you actually start watching it gosh it is really stupid. It is also really confusing. The acting isnt all that great and the dialogue is really stupid.
2,Book is fine; practice exams and answer keys disappointing,"The book presents the material in a concise, effective manner. After a couple hours of buying the book, I was able to read the first two chapters with ease and do the first two exams. However, in grading the exams, I found the answer key to be wrong and answers contradicting text in the first two chapters. Also, so many questions use negative logic that the questions become unnecessarily confusing. I recommend using the Cisco Press books."
5,Life Changing Book,"I read this book many years ago (1992) and loaned out my copy. I found the relating of the truths of Christ to psychological concepts of today to be ""faith"" building for me. I read this book when I was going through a discouraging time in my life and the words and scriptures quoted spoke to me. It confirmed to me that if we commit our lives to Jesus and what He taught us that we will be ""whole"". I remember thinking that He was so wise and that people years ago had similar concerns that we have today. This book literally changed my life and sparked my rededication to Jesus Christ. It is a book that is just as relevant today as when it was first published. I have been telling my friends that we need to revisit this wonderful little book because it is a ""treasure"" of spiritual nuggets that renew your spirit and soul. I recommend it for everyone but especially people working in pastoral counseling or Christian self-help programs."
5,A book worth re-reading,"I have read Sanford's book at least three times over the past ten years. In the cycles of spiritual dryness that come to all of us, the book is like a Spring shower. It becomes a gentle reminder of the reality of the Kingdom and of where we need to direct our search. Sanford's book presents Jesus' wholeness as a state of being that can be ours too. I go to this book frequently not for intellectual stimulation, although it has plenty of that, but with a thirsty heart. I'm not sure that Sanford set out to write a ""inspirational"" book. But I'm sure he would not object if for some of us, it has become just that."
4,"Stimulating Ideas - Shows his case, but doesn't make his cas","The book was very interesting and helpful for those who are genuinely curious to explore the psychological - spiritual dimension of our Lord's life and teaching. The ideas were stimulating. One was left with the feeling though that there was not sufficient scholarship behind the book to make each individual, biblical interpretation solid. Over all he showed me his case (that there is an internal, depth dimension to many of Jesus' stories and sayings - a dimension that has been largely ignored by the historical-critical method - a dimension which can also be investigated within a Jungian framework) was there even if he didin't really make the case himself."
4,Beautiful bracelet!,"This is a beautiful bracelet! The stone on my bracelet was the colorful glowing hue that I was hoping for. I have a large wrist and took a chance on ordering. The silver is very malleable, which makes it an easy fit for my wrist. The silverwork around the cabochon stone is very pretty. It will also be nice if the silver oxidizes a little. I'm very happy with my purchase!"
5,Save the planet!,"We were using way too many papertowels. Decided it was time to change that and Handi-Wipes are the answer for us. They can be used, washed and reused, many times."
3,Yard light,I'm sure I'll like the light. I bought it for my barn but am still awaiting an electrician to install it.
3,Great concept - mildly flawed delivery,"Five strangers are kidnapped by a sick scientist and thrown in a dirty dungeon with nothing but a knife and plenty of water. The motive? To see what they're willing to do for days - weeks, without food. Uncomfortably fun torture-porn idea is weighed down by some obvious lack of realism. Its quite understandable that rapid and severe weight loss is not the easiest thing to portray on screen but like another reviewer stated - why the lack of beard growth? Lori Heuring's hair flows like an Herbal Essences commercial throughout the ordeal. I can also do without the constant close-ups of the red whiskers of the mysterious scientist. Nonetheless - the film has some very memorable moments and tolerable characters (especially an icy Lea Kohl, who uses her sex appeal as a tool for survival). Overall a decent look at the breakdown of humanity that could've been a lot better. Don't buy just rent or watch on Netflix."
3,Worth Watching...,"Not bad overall. This film reminded me of The Original Saw without all the gore and traps. Overall this not a bad film but not great. I would recommend seeing it though at least as a rental. One of the better Frightfest films. Also, Pighunt is quite entertaining. I am viewing the last two of 8 films today and am in the process of leaving reviews of the other 6. I know this review is not indepth but I just really don't want to ruin it for anyone or give too much away. :)"
4,Best interactive fishing game,"Forget PC fishing games that leave you pushing and clicking a mouse around. Or the Wii system's kiddy interactive fishing game. This Xavix console's cartridge game is the best at putting you into the game play.You hold a real feeling rod & reel combo in you hands. Cast and set the hook like you got the ""big one"" on the line. The reel will even give you drag like there's an actual fish playing your line. 3 different difficulty levels each with multiple locations and a good number of bass species to reckon with. Lots of options on lures. You can just fish for fun or enter a tournament for trophies.Don't let that fish get off the hook or snap your line 'cause you never know where or when you might make that trophy catch! Very enjoyable even for an adult and worth every penny."
3,stops working,locks up and you have to restart game and start all over tro get the game to work again. does this way too much. wasnt a good buy. can be fun when it works.
3,Not bad but occasionally get burps,"This is an okay quality oil of oregano because it occasionally gives you oil of oregano burps, which if you haven't had before, it is quite potent."
3,"Nice selection, poor graphics","This collection provides a good overview of modern poetry. However, it would be much more enjoyable if it were formatted so it could be read on an IPhone. The biographies of each poet read fine but the actual poem fonts are so small they're almost impossible to read."
5,Koorax sings the Luiz Bonfa songbook,"Actually, this magnificent album is a Luiz Bonfa songbook, recorded both in Los Angeles and Rio de Janeiro in 1996. Bonfa, a genius of the Brazilian guitar, plays throughout the album, alongside Ron Carter, Deodato, Torcuato Mariano and ace electric guitarist Larry Coryell, for whom he dedicates the irresistible Samblues for Mr. Coryell. There are also great performances of Black Orpheus, Gentle Rain, Menina Flor, Empty Glass and many other Bonfa classics. The title track is a lesser known haunting ballad he wrote with Jobim, and sung by Koorax in a brilliant arrangement by Deodato. If you love jazz oriented Brazilian sounds, do not miss this album."
4,Adding a new twist in season 4,"Get Smart was getting a little worn and predictable by season 3. But having Max and 99 get married gave the show a new twist thatwas really needed by the 4th season. Gave them a whole new range of gags and material to use. And they made good use of them.The show became more domestic, adding another dimension to the James Bond spoof. And adding just that much more room for gagsand good laughs."
3,The tag Lines get old,"In my review of season three I make some of the same complaints that I make in this review But there were some compliments for season threeAt the end of the review I say Will I buy season four It will have to be one heck of a sale...... well it wasI own seasons One, Two and Three. with each season there was something different to enjoySeason one was Max. Season two Actually Agent 13 had a lot to do with the enjoyment of that season and with Season Three I actually noticed The Chief more and his frustration with Max however Season four with the Marriage of Max and 99 added nothing, in my eyes to the show. and you were still stuck with ""sorry about that, and ""I asked you not to tell me that.""So why give it three stars? Zigfried had his moments But not enough I missed Agent 13 showing up hidden in odd places and complainingI wont buy season five"
2,This is just a video of the scenery,"This may be just what you want but actually it was not what I wanted. This is just about an hour of video in Bryce and Zion. The video is beautiful, it has nice music, etc. but there are no people who act as tour guide. I was kind of hoping for a tour guide. Oh, well."
1,NEVER BUY IT,"I tried it with some hope to improve my frizzy curly hair, no result. I would say my hair became more frizzy.WAIST OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and time"
2,Felt waxy,"My hair is dry, thick, curly and frizzy. Several friends with curly hair recommended this product. It left my hair feeling very waxy. It was not oily, but waxy. It was not hard to comb, which was good. But my hair ended up even thicker than usual. It looked like a broom covered in a thin layer of candle wax. And it felt that way too. :("
2,Handi Wipes Heavy Duty Reusable cloths,"I recently order 18 packs (54cloths) I have been using the heavy duty for years until the past months, none of the stores have been carrying them. I ordered 18 packs and the cloths do not anyway compare to the orginal heavy duty cloths that I was using for years. I have two of the original cloths left and there is on comparsion to the original. This product has NO substance, are lighter weight, not tough and don't last like the previous handi wipes. I might as well be using the regular handi-wipes that I don't care for. I am now stuck with 18 packs of wipes that I do not like. Why change a good product????? Thank you Mary Ann"
3,Heavy Wipes,"Product is not the same as the usual Heavy wipes I used to purchase for many years. Size is much smaller, not as strong. I have used ""Heavy Wipes"" for years and this does not seem to be the same product although packaged the same with wipes being same color and outward appearance. They are certainly better than ""Handi Wipes"" that are not the heavy duty type although I believe they were marketed as ""Heavy Wipes"" on label.Since purchased I have found them at K-Mart less expensive."
5,"Handi Wipes, Heavy Duty",I have looked for these for several years and just decided they weren't being made anymore. Then one day I saw them here and was so excited. I love them to wash dishes with. They are so soft and last a long time.
4,Heavy Wipes,"I was so disappointed when I could no longer find ""heavy wipes"" at any local discount stores or any other retail store. I decided to look on the internet and finally located them on Amazon.com. My mom, my daughter and I all used them, so I had no problem with ordering a case of 18. I use them for washing dishes and also to wash makeup off. They work much better than a regular washcloth for makeup because they rinse so well and you don't end up with an ugly stain when you wash and reuse them. I will say that the ones I ordered don't seem to be quite the same as the ones I had been buying. They don't seem to be as thick and 'cottony' feeling. My mom also said she didn't think they were quite the same. I still like them better than Handiwipes or any other disposable cloths I've found, but I wish they hadn't changed the fabric. I'm sure I'll order more when these are gone if they're not back in the stores."
3,"What I ordered and is pictured, is not what I received.","I ordered Heavy wipes and was very excited about my order because I haven't been able to find Heavy Wipes in the grocery stores any more. What I was sent was Handi Wipes - heavy duty. The picture shown is not the real product I received - but is the product I was interested in purchasing. The description matches what I received, but is misleading. I know the difference between Handi Wipes and Heavy Wipes and they are not the same item or quality. I figured some one didn't know the difference and I kept my order. The wipes I received aren't as heavy/strong as the product I ordered or have used in the past; but, they are better than the Handi wipes I have bought in the past. This could be considered a case of false advertising - but, I figured it wasn't done on purpose."
1,less material,"I have been purchasing this item for many years, first from K-Mart Wal-Mart and now the internet. What first attracted me to this item was the absorbency that Handi-Wipes lacked, but now since they have changed the size of the cloth I am having the same problem as I did before. As always magnufactures cutting costs, you get less product in order to boost profits."
3,I prefer console version,"ps2 version was good, someone told me that the pc version was better. I strongly disagree. thats all."
5,So many things to do!,"The added jedi and space maps are fun. However Pandemic and Lucas Arts should have left some maps from SWBF1 such as Bespin and Rhen Var. These maps can now be played in the 1.1 patched version of the game, but they are mods maps and most people don't play mods, so...Well anyway, it is a pretty good game and it has some cool stuff in it. When you get too good at playing normally, then maybe the way of glitching is the way for you. If so, check out www.wallparty.2ya.comMay the glitch be with you always. :-)"
2,What is all the hype about?,"I was debating between FEAR, Quake4, and this game. Bought this one because it was available at the time. Very disappointed in the gameplay. Nothing innovative. Feels like a 3-4 year old shooter. Even being able to play as various types from both trilogies wasn't enough to save this for me. The space battles were painfully repetitive, the ground battles were so-so, and the conquest mode was just plain dumb in its simplicity. Multi-player was enough for a little fun for a while. You will definitely get more bang for your buck almost anywhere else."
5,My 8-year old loves it.,"Apparently, this is the game all the 3rd grade boys are playing. My boy and his buddies have been giving it quite a workout."
3,Space to difficult to control,Don't care for this as much as the original. To much emphasis on flight (space) which I find very difficult to control with the mouse and keyboard. I have not yet tried it with Fang. The land based scenarios seem fine. I use a MX 518 gaming mouse and even tweaking the tracking speed does not help.
3,skylermerris,"This game has good controls and features but the campaigns suck. you are only givin about 30 per objective and they are ""retarded"". they get wiped out while the enemy has unlimited soldiers. it is not in any way true to the movies or even the original. i give it a 3."
2,Good for ps2 not computer,I ordered this game and it came quick. I went to install the game and the first disk said battlefront 1 instead of 2 and then I tried to install it and when it told me to put in the second disk I did and it said catistrophic failure and crashed. I tried to do this multiple times. Maybe I just did something wrong but to me this game was a waste of 8 dollars
4,Great game!,"This is a great game that runs smoothy annd efficiently.There is a lot more words than in the psp version (i have it too) and the gameplay is just fine util youve pretty much get so skilled, it gets graually boring and easy. Once it gets like that,change your difficulty setting to 'Elite'."
5,I'm passing on this review from an 11 year old boy,"This is the best game ever! [Note: the reviewer has, I'm ashamed to say, extensive experience on numerous video games, including countless recent hours on Minecraft. I was surprised he would like this blessedly cheap little game so much.]"
2,Hero vs Villains,"Is the only part of the game i enjoy. The battles are lame, the graphics are lame, the gameplay is lame. Jedi Knight Outcast 2 was a better game and that was 5 years ago."
4,Very fun,"Despite the buggy AIs in the game, it's still a fantastic game that has many facets of entertainment and hidden things. My favorite is the ship battles, where you can go onto the other team's ship and blow up stuff from the inside.I tried to play online, but people using mods and cheats take all the fun away."
3,SW Battlefront II,The game is fun to play but beware of the disk protection. Securom gave me a very difficult install process.
2,"Fun Game, terrible support","This game is awesome, but on the PC it's buggy not running very well, the old maps cut out and hang almost every time. If all you want to do is the Old Republic stuff then you'll be fine. All in all quite dissapointing with Lucas Arts not planning on releasing any new updates. Tested it on 3 different computers with Vista and XP with various bugs in each."
4,Finally Revenge on JarJar,"The absolute best part of this game is the Hunt type game. In this mode it pits you against various planets natural inhabitants. On Naboo you hunt Gungans! Nothing like blasting away at Jar Jar for a few minutes after watching Episode I,II, and III"
5,Best Game Ever,"his game is one of the best games ever.You Can fight in space using a lot more vechiles than Battlefront 1.Also fighting on th ground is sweet.You can play as Yoda,Darth Maul,Darth Vader,Han Solo,and much more.Even Genarl Greivous.ALmost every team has one new fighter.It is by far one of the best games and way better than Battlefront 1."
5,Works in Windows 7 - Fun Game,The only thing I can say about the product was that the Jewel Case was cracked. Disc was fine. I was worried about the negative reviews that it wouldn't work for Windows 7. I followed the advice of putting a plug in the external microphone plug jack and It loaded flawlessly. This purchase was for our child and he has had nothing but good things to say about the game. Enjoy.
2,orchestral arrangements from denmark,"spoon is great. I heard a cut from this effort on wbgo and bought the disc because I really enjoy listening toblues with lush arrangements. The title track is exceptional, the rest hum hum but VERY BLUE as in Blues."
5,good buy.,I teach elementary music. I've bought 'no name' kazoo'sand they fall apart before we even use themHohner's are the best and the price is right also.I purchase these by the box and I am never disappointed.
2,Not worth the price,"I just received my Hohner Kazoo from the seller and am extremely disappointed. Although item amount is never specified, the picture that accompanies the listing is for a jar of kazoos.Now, I know that the pictures are not always accurate on Amazon but the original list price is $17.50 and the item weight is 8 ounces so don't think I am out of line for expecting more than one plastic kazoo. There is just no way that this is a $17.50 kazoo which means that I did not save 84% on this purchase when I paid $2.80 as it stated on the product page. I paid $2.80 for a $2.80 kazoo. Not much of a bargain when the same kazoo can be found at numerous sites on the web for 99 cents."
2,Kazoo blew,I purchased three Kazoos. They look nice. The tissue thin paper disc inserted in the bowl blew out of shape repeatedly on all three after just a brief moments use. Rendering it unplayable until you popped it open & flattened the paper. And then it would do it again.
1,Not So Good,"This product was shipped with only one item, when I ordered four. I payed extra for prime shipping and it came two weeks later. It was very frustrating, because I was using them for a project. When I finally received the product, it did not work. I strongly disagree with buying this product."
1,No sound,These were supposed to make sounds when you blow into them but no sound came out. They were so cheap I didn't bother to return them or complain to the seller. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Piece of Crap!!,"This thing didn't even work!! We got this for our Daughter to play with and were so excited, and....it didn't have the rubber valve need to make the noise. Fraud. Do not waste your dollar on this."
1,THE WORST I'VE HAD,"DON'T BUY THIS, USED FOR 5 MINUTES BOTH GONE I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.SO . THE SOUND IS NOT THERE."
2,Okay,"The kazoo was okay, and it took a wee while to be use it and it was great once I was able to. But unfortunately it broke after 14 days."
2,Not worth it,My 2.5 son was bored with it after 1hrWas cheap but its not worth the bother. Buy some other noise maker
4,krazy kazoo,"I love kazoos! Although this isn't the best made kazoo out there, it's well worth the money , and IT WORKS. I bought a couple of these for my nieces and nephews. I got the package in the mail, tried one out, and went right back to my computer and ordered one for myself!"
3,Measured Shop Drawings for American Furniture,"Modern furniture makers will enjoy the detailed measured drawings and the 320 pages of content. I would classify the designs as not shaker but Danish Modern with a twist to Contemporary design. As traditional cabinetmaker's we find the designs too refined toward Modern and the furniture looses the feeling of richness and spontaneity associated with American Colonial Furniture. In all, a bunch of good lessons in furniture design!"
5,An original campy funny gore fest,"If you like original humor, dark humor, humor that knows no bounds... then you have to see this movie.It does start a little slow... but stick with it... once it picks up it keeps rolling.For having very little money or talent to work with (no big name stars) the group here managed to churn out a classic of unspeakable proportions.I don't want to give away too much... but there is humor here that can be quite offensive in today's climate. This was made before things became 'politically correct'... so, if you offend easy then this one isn't for you.But... if you want a number of really good belly laughs then I recommend you buy this one.... you'll want to watch it a number of times."
2,A slasher film for those who don't like slasher films,"Bloody indeed! Gore galore! But there is enough humor and shtick to overcome all that muck. We laughed from beginning to end. The nicotine addicted wife should be the star of the show.And it was filmed in Pittsburgh - Lawrenceville, the strip, the north side. There is no Egyptian quarter in Pittsburgh."
4,Excellent reference book for model building,"As an advanced aircraft and military vehicles modeler, I found this book to be concise with good photos and illustrations. Moder aircraft are described properly with excellent informative text."
4,Immediately Applicable,"I received this book a couple days before teaching a class that I teach a couple times a month on job searching. I browsed through a night or two before my class and was able to find new interactive strategies that I applied right away. By the end of the workshop, participants almost groaned when I brought out the index cards!I thought a few of the activities were pretty similar, and I don't know that they each merited separate treatment, but overall, this is a very helpful book. I especially like the way Thiagi gives suggestions for using the activities with larger or smaller groups or with more or (as is usually the case!) less time. I will be passing this book on to co-workers so they can benefit from the ideas in it."
5,My Lucky Penny (Not Yet!),"The Lucky Penny by Joseph Scaglione and Kathy Szarko is well written, full of color and instills values in children. As a teacher and a grandmother, I have read and played The Lucky Penny many times for students and grandchildren. I feel it is a worthwhile project to get children to comment on the story and its value. Most children relate to the brother sister relationship. The colorful pictures, give students the opportunity to follow the story line and recall facts. I not only have this in my classroom and my home, it is now a proud member of our school library. I can't wait for the next one!"
4,Nostalgia trip,"Ok, this isn't about whether the music good or bad. We are not talking musical genuis, it is the Brady Bunch so what do you expect? This is about memories...I had this on 8-track when I was 8 or 9 years old and the songs bring back so many childhood memories you can't help but smile. If you are looking for high quality music, don't buy it, but if you are looking for a fun stroll down memory lane...go for it."
3,Viable product,"This second Brady album delivers more of the same, with a slick pro band backing the kids as they do their best to sing together and with solos. Notable winners include the TV-famous ""It's a Sunshine Day"" and ""Keep On"", the rather intricate vocal stylings of the catchy ""Merry Go Round,"" a funny but interesting version of ""Love Me Do,"" and the rockin' ""Candy"" which the good liner notes (indeed, all these Brady rereleases have pretty good background info) justly describes as borderline obscene. The rest aren't as memorable, with ""You Need that Rockn'Roll"" as a particular low point. It is interesting to note that this kind of teen dream phenomenon is still going on; Sabrina the Teenage Witch, for example, has her own spinoff saturday morning cartoon show and rock music album, except they only make her sing one song, having learned the Brady lesson. And yet, dated though much of this stuff is, the Brady kids did a remarkably good job under high pressure and ill-conceived ventures."
3,Decent/So-So,"Not as ambitious as the other Brady Bunch CDs. They cover everyone from Beatles to Chicago. CANDY is the highlight of the CD but you can get that on the ""Best Of"" CD. Love ""Saturday in the Park"" but it's the song I love so it doesn't matter who sings it."
2,THIS SUCKS LIKE NOTHING HAS SUCKED BEFORE,THE ONLY REASON I GAVE THIS 2 STARS IS BECAUSE IT HAS BONUS MATERIAL ON IT. WHO KNEW THAT CHRIS KNIGHT AND MAUREEN MCCORMICK HAD MADE AN ALBUM TOGETGER? I REMEMBER SEEING MAUREEN ON AMERICAN BANDSTAND SINGING THE SONG HEY LITTLE BIRD AND I THOUGHT SHE HAD A GREAT VOICE! AND TO FINALLY FIND IT ON CD WAS ALMOST MORE THAN I COULD BEAR!!! HOW I DROVE MY FAMILY CRAZY WHEN I WAS A KID LOOKING FOR THAT RECORD...BUT REALLY...LOVE ME DO? I FINALLY THREW THIS CD OUT WHEN I MOVED TO A CRAMPED NYC APT AND DID NOT WANT TO WASTE SPACE ON CRAP I WOULD NEVER LISTEN TO AGAIN...IT WAS NICE FOR A LAUGH AND A WALK DOWN MEMORY LANE BUT THATS IT!!!!
3,Good book,"I was hoping this book was going to be a big hit like Daddy Kisses, but it just never caught on."
2,"OK, but what's with the S.A.T. vocabulary","This book teaches babies the names of the different animals and their own babies. You've got your basic animals: Cat / Kitten, Bird / Chick, and then they get a little crazy. I think I might have once learned that a baby elephant is called a calf, but I'm sure I've never learned until reading this book that a baby swan is called a cygnet. Come on. The book has only about 50 words in it, why not keep the vocabulary to the level of the intended audience."
2,The Cajuns,"I am 100% Cajun and grew up in ""Cajun Country"" in the 50's. The author reinforces the stereoptypes of the people of Acadiana that we fought to hard to temper. Like any other part of the U.S. with ethnic differences, the south has received much in the way of superior regional literature. Read James Lee Burke and one will understand the good and bad of Cajun Louisiana. This book is but a poor imitation of Burke's art and I'm sorry to say that after reading about half of The Cajuns I wanted to chuck the book across the room."
3,Readable,"The Cajuns is a fun read, probably more so for someone who is from the area. Nothing profound, nothing to make me want to re-read, but I am glad I read it. Part culture, part mystery, part romance, part character tableau."
4,Sex scenes are unrealistic,"I liked this book but I just have to ""vent"" a little about how the author writes about sex. Even though the sex scenes are pretty good and realistic to a point, Weill refers to the main character's ""sex"" as in she ""touched his sex."" Now everyone reading this book knows that the term ""sex"" is never used by a real man to describe his genitals. Even children now are taught the proper term. I am old enough to know that a grown man has never thought of his body in this way. Later in the book Weill uses an explicit word for the male genitals as part of a character's dialogue. Why then would he use the silly term ""his sex"" in the book? Surely a man born in 1933 knows better than this."
2,Outdated,"The photos in this book look like they were shot in the 80's. Hideous wallpaper, ugly paint colors, and gross fabric. Also this book is almost page by page an exact copy of the early edition entitled ""Ideas for Great Kid's Rooms"" ISBN 0376017546.Yes there are a few good ideas in this book so I gave it two stars instead of one, but unless you can get it used under two bucks, don't waste your money."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS VENDOR,"Misleading and false advertisement. If you are looking at the rectagle yellow bottle posted and described, please be aware that is not what you will receive. This vendor is non cooperative and if this is what your looking for, DO NOT PURCHASE HERE!"
2,"great method, poor content","The one thing I would say about the author is that I like the method of how he teaches: his method of tablature, etc. It is very easy to follow and so forth. However, what he teaches is a different story. As another reviewer noted, there is a LOT of 'filler' and stuff that don't much apply to learning the harp, and you learn so-callled 'popular' riffs that don't sound like anything. I honestly don't feel like I've learned much at all from this particlar book."
3,A good value,"Nothing sophisticated here, but not a bad introductory book for the beginning harmonica-player. The teaching style is simple and straightforward, with few words ""wasted"" on theory. The inclusion of an actual harmonica--not the world's greatest, of course, but okay for starters--makes this package a nifty gift for aspiring young musicians."
5,Breaking the Pattern by Charles Platkin,"I started reading this book yesterday morning and had finished it before the day ended. I couldn't put it down. In these troubling times, Platkin provides the motivation and inspiration we all need to get back up and start seeking our dreams again. It is a refreshing ray of optisim in a world that is so often characterized by hopeless pessimism."
1,Common Sense that People Should Know Already,"I bought this when I was a little heavier hoping it will help. I read it and it really didn't provide that much value or information. A couple of years after that I just started working out and eating healthy and now I am happy with my weight and fitness. There are no selfhelp books or secrets that can help you lose weight. The only thing that works is staying active and eating well. Heck, I should write a book about how I lost 25lbs and kept them off. Do you think I can make money that way?"
1,useless advice,Another in a long line of useless self-help books. This book offers nothing original and perpetuates the myth that understanding what happened in the past is essential to future success. The ridiculous exercises could eat up a lot of time. This is the only book I have ever returned to Amazon.[com.]
1,YOU DO NOT GET WHAT IS SHOWN,I ordered this Salada DECAF White/Green Tea Blend because I had tried it somewhere and loved the taste. I looked in many stores but could not find it. Everyone had Decaf Green and Decaf White but nobody had the blend of both. I was SO HAPPY when I found it shown and listed on amazon so I was thrilled to order the case of 6 boxes. It arrived a week later only to be 6 boxes of the Decaf WHITE Tea and NOT the blend as advertised on this website. BE careful ordering this most likely you will NOT get what you ordered.
2,Eccch!,"A DeBartolo autobiography disguised as an insider's view of MAD, with enough effusive praise of Bill Gaines to satisfy those MAD fans who would like to sanctify the old devil. It is pretty obvious that this book was aimed at the MAD fans who will buy ANYTHING even remotely connected to the magazine. Yes, it is shameless commercialism at its worst. To his credit, DeBartolo really tries hard to make this book work, although most of the shtick has been done before, and better. Worthwhile elements in this mish-mosh are several funny 'forwards' and the artwork by various members of the Usual Gang of Idiots. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,Dan Coates Complete / Advanced Piano Solos (The Professional Touch Series),"Received the item exactly 1 month after purchased. Generally, book condition is good except that the packing could be improved.The book was found to have a line due to bending on one of the book edge.The music notes are big, clear and beautifully arranged. Price very reasonable. Would be better if there is lyrics as well.Thank you."
2,Arrangements were not by Dan Coates,"Very disappointed in this book. I love anything arranged by Dan Coates, and looked forward to having this book of his arrangements. Very few songs in this book were actually arranged by Mr. Coates. Most of these songs I already have in other books by other arrangers, and thought I was getting these songs with different arrangements (by Dan Coates). I just got the same songs by the same arrangers. Only a handfull of songs were Dan coates arrangements. Very misleading!"
3,A moderate trading book,"If you are a casual amateur investor who enjoys reading trading books of the interview type, this is okay. If you aspire to be a pro and are actually a pro, you wont be satisfied with the depth and width of it. The trading styles of the interviewees, and so are the Q&As, are just so diverse that one can hardly grasp something ""profitable"" to his/her own trading. Of course, most of them do mention ""no loss averaging, keep losses small, have discipline"" blah blah blah, but do most of the trading books talk about the same stuff?"
5,A seminal recording in the history of folk music,"This CD represents one of the most important collections of contemporary (post WWII) folk music. The Weavers created a style - combining high artistic standards with personal social justice commitments - which set the stage for nearly every other folk and acoustic musician who followed them. Whatever one's politics, if you play or listen or enjoy folk music, this is a must record for your collection"
1,Bait and switch,"Think of this album as The Weavers meet Mitch Miller and Lawrence Welk. I love The Weavers as a folk group.This recording,complete with its chorus,violins and big band backup is to folk music what Brittany Spears is to Joan Baez."
3,nook table,The table is nice. The wood is soft so you need to cover it when used. So far that is the only part of this set that has caused no problems.
5,As good as advertised,"The head works just as advertised, and provides a smooth, super close shave, without the hassles of using razor blades and gooey shaving cream."
5,LOVE IT!,"Nothing to say except LOVE it! Naturally keeps water cooler than the room temperature, which was a pleasant surprise."
3,Picks up Where the Others Leave Off,"I can recommend this book on two conditions: one, if you have already read The Art Of Voice Acting by James Alburger and two, you are enrolled in a voice workshop or class where you can ask an instructor follow up questions. Some of the advice in this book is patently false. For example, a three and a half minute demo tape? Most demos run one and a half to two minutes, tops. And the author gives the impression that you can make your own demo, when the industry demands a professionally produced tape or cd just to get an agent. It's not fair to say that all the information within this book is not useful, but I would place it a distant third behind the two fine books by Alburger and Elaine Clark."
3,ekco small turner,"I love the size and shape of this, but it bends a little too much, just wish it were a little sturdier metal"
5,Great buy!,What a great deal this was. The grill pan was less than half price and the two All-Clad oven mitts are a terrific bonus. Macy's shipped this almost immediately and it arrive very quickly.
3,Grilling on the stove,"I wish I had read further about this grill, because it works great, but wasn't what I needed,and it's my fault, so I kept it!!! I have only used it once. I wanted the one that has two sides, one to grill meats, and one to make pancakes etc.. Like I said it's my fault, and other than what I needed it for, it works really great, it is large and that was what I needed too, it's just not the one I really wanted Great seller though it came quickly and packaged well!!"
3,Not so bad,"On this first real Brady Bunch album, after their abysmal Christmas effort, the kids do a credible job and the producer manages to put together a viable product, amazingly enough. He even coaxes some harmonies out of them. It's not as easy to sing with a crowd as you might think, especially when not eveyone can sing equally well. This album is notable, apart from the famous version of ""American Pie,"" for the classic Brady tunes from the T.V. show (although these are different recordings of them), ""Time to Change"" and ""We Can Make the World a Whole Lot Brighter."" The Bradies remain a fascinating experiment of personalities, and while this is hardly genius stuff, much of it has time capsule appeal."
3,More songs from the TV show,"This is an OK colelction. Better than some of them. Hilarious is the American Pie cover. Although they do not sing all of the verses, the musical arrangement is pretty good.They also cover songs by Bread and others."
1,Do not order this!!,"I ordered this --in fact I ordered 2 because I really love the smell of this perfume. The picture is of perfume right? I got 2 bottles of body lotion with no explanation. It was up to me to contact them and ask what happened. They sent me a response with the following---""We apologize for the error on your order and for any inconvenience it may have caused you. During an inventory upload on Amazon, the product you ordered was affiliated with the incorrect product description stated on Amazon. Our IT department has since resolved the issue.""Then...take it DOWN! Stop offering perfume when you only have body lotion. Now I have to ship it back to them to get a refund. They do not have any perfume at all.Watch out for this vendor. God knows what you might get when you place an order for Calvin Klein...you will end up with some Juicy."
2,"A fast read for the beach or plane, but that's about it.","It's a fast read, and the plot is enough to keep you mildly interested, but there isn't a single character worth a damn. Not a single, interesting character. This book abounds with cliche and obvious ""twists"". It also contains a major flaw/plot hole. The main character emails the love interest he had only met once before. In the email he asks her to call him since he doesn't have her phone number. Not 10 pages later, he's running from the bad guy and DUCKS INTO A PHONE BOOTH AND CALLS the love interest to see if he can hide out at her place til noon the next day. I wouldn't recommend buying this book. Heck, I don't really recommend reading it."
3,Not Bad...a good start to a series...,"No one will confuse this with great literature or even the great thrillers...however, it is not a bad first novel. The story is very linear. Not an overly complex story--it is actually fairly simple. I wish there were more intriguing twists and turns. However, Simon and Lara are really promising characters. I liked the fact that Simon is not movie star good looking. He is a humble and good guy. The technology was used to good effect. I do hope to see more depth in Bagman."
1,how to take short cuts and miss important points,"I was very disappointed in the book. The only area that I found helpful at all was the math section. The quick reading hints were old news. I have found that by reading in this fashion, I have missed key points and important issues. Depending on a persons line of work, I suppose it could be helpful to some, but not for me. I prefer to be more fine tuned."
2,out of date info,"this book is almost twenty years old - yet the author feels eligible to criticize others whose books are much more current. i think he is mean-spirited, and should update his work."
2,Below Expectation,"It promises a lot, but I hope the author understands that satisfaction with a book is aligned with the expectation fulfilled."
1,I am disgusted by the tone of this book,"I find the ""ideas"" in this book repugnant, namely that craft skills to display the pretense of intelligence for purely narcissistic purposes are a ready substitute for actual thought, introspection and self-development."
3,My Dog is a chewer Fonzsworth,"This is the second Booda that we have had,both the green end and the yellow end are chewed off, this is after a few months play. The new booda was given to Fonzie and in two minuets the noise maker was smashed and did not work, does not matter to Fonzie. As far as Fonzie is concerned the Booda is OK"
2,Looks good but...,"This looks lovely, but the lid doesn't stay on so it's really not very good. Plus, the 1/4 pound stick BARELY fits. You'd be better off buying one that looks good AND has a lid that fits well."
2,Not too useful for translating Latin text,"I have used this pocket dictionary for about 5 months now, and so far, I am not impressed. I use it to translate Latin to English and find only about 70% of the words when I search in this dictionary. I realize there are many, many different forms of Latin words, but this book seems to be missing a lot. I am currently looking for a better, more concise, Latin dictionary. Any recommendations would be helpful."
3,Millbrooks Psychedelic Prankster,"Timothy Leary was a unique American to say the least. As a longtime fan of Sixties psychedelic rock and Beat literature, It stood to reason that I would find my way to Timothy Leary. This book is an amusing collection of lectures and tales from the High Priest of LSD. I found Leary to be a very humorous writer but he does take liberties with the facts. He misquotes the the Four Noble Truths of the Buddha, for example. This book has to be read with a grain of salt. I think Leary intended it this way. It would be terribly insulting to ones intelligence if he didnt. His intelligence and humor do shine through however. I would state that this book should probably be only read for entertainment by those of us who have a bias towards certain experiences that Leary espouses in his book. A real good read but definitely not for everyone."
2,Don't quit your day job!,"""Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out"" goes to show that tuning in after dropping out wasn't really an option for Mr. Leary. In spite of the cultural change he helped initiate, he didn't accomplish much after leaving Harvard to begin ""concentrating"" on the study of his own consciousness.Leary's work is not only childish and absurd, but lacking a great deal of substance from virtually every perspective. If it weren't for the true intellectual achievements of Albert Hoffman and Aldous Huxley, which show compelling arguments for the research of not only the drugs themselves but the effects on man and society, this era would look like nothing more than a bad trip to anyone looking back.TL;DR: This book is worth the read for an ""understanding"" of Leary's mentality, but its ideas should definitely be taken with a grain of salt. (i.e. Don't quit your day job!)"
4,"fun ""animated"" Giselle","This doll recaptures the charm from the animated Andalasian segments of Disney's hit movie ""Enchanted"". The character of Giselle comes dressed in her long pink gown with flouncy white off-the-shoulder collar. A wreath of flowers sits atop her long strawberry blonde hair.Unlike the 'Fairytale Wedding' Giselle doll (which has a realistic face sculpted in the likeness of actress Amy Adams), this doll's head is molded to resemble the animated version of the character; so everything is larger than life. She's one of the nicest Disney dolls I've seen in a while.Definitely one for the Disney fanatic in your life!"
3,Good but not great,"Checked this book out of local library....maybe 3 chapters dedicated to actual stock selection, the rest talks about economic cycles, inflation, PE ratios, etc.Recommendeed by O'Neil associate David Ryan in Market Wizards I and also by Mark Minervini in Market Wizards III. Note that Minervini is allegedly an ex-employee of O'Neil also.This book came out in 1977. Maybe back then it was earth-shattering and revolutionary. However in 2004, all the ""stock selection"" concepts are covered by William O'Neil's books and by Stan Weinstein.You might save your money on this one."
4,Hair Growth,"Not sure if this is actually making my healthier, but it seems to be making my hair grow a lot faster than it would normally grow. I've been using this product for about 3 months."
3,Mistaken,"To the Amazon.com customer that had reveiwed this album, (or if he/she even reviewed it correctly). I like to say that this artist Aaron, first of all has nothing to do with hip hop, second of all he is not even in the same music genre, Third of all, DMX is mad all the time probably because of a bi-polar disorder and lastly, Aaron does not even record or reside in the same country as any of the rappers that you had mentioned in your reveiw. Off the record, I had a good 15 minute chuckle from your reveiw. I just wanted to point out certain facts that can help distinguish this artist."
1,What kind of album is this?,"I bought this album, being attracted by the cover and the looks of the artist. However, the singing is just terrible! Aaron Kwok no doubt has a nice face. Yet, he simply can't sing. The music is also monotonous and too simplistic. Disappointing!"
3,Very well done for being brought out in the seventies,Seane Keane is a real master of Celtic music. And the tunes that I have listened to were very well done. Listening to Celtic music for several years now I have found very few matches for Sean Keane.
3,"Really 3 and a half stars; not bad, but not great","I have managed to complete ""Creation of the Gods"", and while I enjoyed the read (for a two-volume book, it reads quickly), I must confess I am a bit disappointed.The plot summary below is accurate, so I won't add to that. However, I think that the translation is pretty poor. Grammatical errors appear aplenty, and the book editors should be fired; there is a mistake every page! Also, the tale itself failed to grip me as much as, say, ""Outlaws of the Marsh"" or ""Journey to the West"" (and here, I disagree with the review below; I thought the translation of ""Journey"" was sorely lacking). All in all, I felt I was reading (decidedly more violent) lite fantasy fare ; the literary value here fails to satisfy as much as I would like."
1,A B.C. disappointment,"This video was dissappointing in that it was quite dated (circa 1970's), quite short at 30 minutes, overpriced considering the length and focused on more touristy things in this beatiful province. I bought this for a friend so he could see the beauty of British Columbia and this video excluded so much of the province it was just not worthwhile. I lived in Prince George, B.C. for a number of years and am well aware of the incredible scenery. Unfortunately this video did not nearly do justice to the province."
5,Great item!,I bought these at the suggestion of my friends. I bought several for my dulcimers and fiddles. It's very cheap insurance to protect your instruments.
2,...just mediochre.,Lately Christian Slater has been making 'payday films' much like Val Kilmer.2 stars is generous.This film left me dangling after having seen the Costner film. In fact I felt I had been hanged and scalpted. If you are curious...rent. You have been warned.The Kevin Costner Hatfields and McCoys is far superior.
4,Better Than I Expected,"When I go to see a movie, I take into account the amount of money spent making it and the enjoyment an audience should get from the film. If it cost $50 million, then it had better knock my socks off. With the name Fred Olen Ray on a production, I expect low budget, but it does not necessarily mean low quality. I enjoyed this film. There was some weak acting, as someone pointed out. But then you have Jerry Lacy, Jeff Fahey and Perry King to balance that out and make an enjoyable film. I thought the sets were adequate, probably more in tune with how things were ""back in the day."" It had a one-room schoolhouse feel and that's good. You can tell a story with out all the frills. Kudos to Mr. Ray on this one."
2,somewhat inaccurate; poor acting overall,"This is a truncated version of the real events, which went on for nearly 30 years, apparently. It is the condensed story instead of the whole story, and the lousy acting by most of the performers does not help."
1,Depressing and boring,"I decided to watch this since I had just seen the last two episodes of a different movie on the Hatfields and the McCoys, and as others previously stated, I have to ask ""Which story is the truth, if either?"" Which caused further dissappointment because I seriously wanted to know what happened. Needless to say about halfway through it I just gave up. Cannot recommendthis at all!! Too many other great things to watch!"
2,republished earlier books,"Way too much repeat of the earlier books, practically copied pages at at time of the earlier books. Made this book slow and boring."
1,Didn't like it at all!,"This book is told from so many points of view I just couldn't get into it. One minute it would be from the son's point of view, then the mother's, then the father's, then the brother's, then the lover's. It was all over the place. I like an accurate account of history in my historical romance novels. But, this one told so much history there wasn't much room for romance. It seemed as though the ""story"" was just thrown in to make the history lesson more interesting. Of course this is just my opinion, but I wanted more romance, centered on one couple. I didn't like it at all."
1,OK music,bought this years ago and traded it in. I guess I am getting old as I recently bought this and only liked one song everything else was dated and 80ish...
1,Can't hear a thing,"I very much would like to write a review; but there are no soundtracks available to listen to.......can you help me out here, please?What's the dealy, here?"
2,Correction,"Enjoyed the book. There is, however, an error I would like to point out.""Shoeless Joe"" Jackson was not born in Hanibal MO, but in the Greenville, SC area where he first played baseball and where, following his forced retirement, he lived until his death. The ""Shoeless Joe from Hanibal Mo"" was the mythical character in ""Damn Yankees""."
1,Cheap item that fell apart right away,My son had this clock less than a month on his wall before the second hand got stuck and the dials wouldn't move. Had to throw it out.
2,Well...,"There are only a few books in my life (at least that I can remember) where I put down with the purpose of not finishing them. This was one of those books. Don't get me wrong the plot had tons of potential; it was very good sounding plot but the way the book was written was...well....bad. It's been a while since I set this book down so I don't remember the specifics. Maybe the words did not flow or the description was flat. Whatever the case, I put it down planning to never pick it up again."
5,a must read book,"this book is about a young boy who discovers his destiny as a sorcerer and with his freinds embarks on a incredible journey into the mysterious world, this book is a brilliant read for 13+ years it is full of suspense, mystery, loyalty between freinds and a hint of young love - what more could you ask for this book is a must read. 5* stars"
1,"A Terrible, Horrible, Dreadful, Wretched Hack Job of a Book","My 11-year-old son and I read this book together, and it was so bad that we laughed out loud at times. The main characters are undifferentiated and dull (and there are too many of them); the plot is nonexistent; the conversations among the kids that are supposed to be witty are so leaden they make one wince; and nothing ever happens for any logical reason, or because anyone does anything heroic or brave (or even intelligible). Literally, one of the worst books we've ever read. LOL low point: The five (!) main kid characters all get dispersed separately to different locales in a new world they've never been to. Whereupon they all ... go to sleep. As my son said, ""They get sent to a new world, and they all go to SLEEP?"" He and I spent a lot of time pondering what the author might have had on the publisher that would have occasioned this slop being made into a book. Our theories were a lot more creative than anything between these covers."
1,This thing sucks!,"We bought this gazebo because it was larger due to the hexagonal shape. I was so excited. We put it together (it took forever I might add), tied it to the house and the ground, and began to have out cookout! I was so happy with it. Every night I went out to the gazebo and read a book, bug free due to the mosquito net.Then one morning, not even 5 days after we bought it, we woke up and it had collapsed in the night. there was a sprinkle of a rain shower, but I dont know what else could have caused it to keel over like that. it smushed my new plants I had bought and nearly broke our grill.Do not buy this, it is a waste of time and money. I returned it promptly."
5,Great filter,"The filter fits the filter box nicely. My mileage didn't fall off after I installed it, so I'll assume it's not restrictive. Not much to say in an air filter review, is there?"
2,worked well until it died (2 years),"I received this for Christmas in 2004, and it worked well for two years until it died in December 2006. The warranty is 90 days, so I asked Customer Support of they just expect this sort of thing? They offered to repair it for $24.75, but I could buy a new one for about the same price. Still trying to decide what to do."
1,It doesn't work,I just open it and it doesn't work. The remote doesn't work.And it doesn't open. But the power comes on. I'm going to go return now..
2,Thirty Dollar Processor...,"i just purchased this Processor, in Refurbished condition from ""Newegg"" For 30.00 + Tax. i have an H.P. Comp. from 2007, that i just pulled off a shelf. and i laughed when i fired it up and realized it was a single Core... i had almost forgotten they Existed... (not really)... this processor is a Definite improvement over the Single core Athlon 64 4000+ that came with my old H.P.ebay had them today(09/02/12) for 90 Bucks.. but that is too high a price, when Amazon can sell me a New ASUS Motherboard and Dual Core AMD Sempron Processor for 100 Bucks."
1,Police State,This book is right wing propaganda. It's fascists like Laurence who advocate their own police state and systematically dismantle our constitution.
1,"'Socialism"" is not the enemy this author claims""","I agree with the authors claims about the horrors of tasers but his ranting and raving about how ""Socialists"" and ""Socialism"" are to blame is just laughable! This writer can certainly put together headlines and the awful stories about innocent people who have been hurt by these tasers, but as a social anthropologist he fails miserably! If we had more socialism in this country we would have better control of our own lives. Every ""socialist"" institution the American government has created over the years has been an overwhelming success. This is because these activities are governed with oversight by our Congressional representatives and are responsive to citizen complaint. When you take the politics out of an organization it runs more smoothly, efficiently, and it is less costly. This is one of the main reasons we need ""socialized"" medical care in the form of HR 676 ""Medicare for all""."
3,Odder and odder,"""A Simple Man,"" ""Summer Breeze,"" and ""Gonna Find a Rainbow"" are as good as anything the Brady kids ever sang, though nothing on this album is recognizeable from the television show. Much of it seems dull, with too many horns trying to jazz it up. The kids do their best as always, bolstered (as the fine liner notes tell us) by studio backing vocalists. A fine farewell for the strange experiment of Brady Bunch albums."
3,think it would be good if,The tip was broken so you could not screw anything into it. I am sure that it was the result of something screwing up in manufacturing because it looked like maybe the what ever forms the treads broke off inside of it. So probably a 1 in a million thing. Otherwise it seemed well constructed and
4,The Rod,"It is a very sturdy rod, works well in the barrel and because of the material you dont have to worry about nicking the bore. If you clean your guns very often, this will be a benifit for you to have. I bought this product at a great price, the seller said it had a blimish , I havent found it."
3,Great for the job but too expensive.,"Works well for storing your caulk tubes, but it is way too expensive for a piece of plastic."
5,Great Satisfaction,"Unit is better than described, works perfectly. Shipping carton was almost destroyed, but seller had packed unit so well, there was no damage. I am well satisfied."
3,Dog loved it...didn't last,I bought one of these for my dog. He absolutely loved it for a about a week before I had to take it away because he was starting to get large pieces off of it. Great toy if you do not have a dog that is an aggressive chewer.
5,Tail wagging fun!,"My dog loves Quirkies Tail Wagger. While it's not as sturdy as the Kong products, the Tail Wagger squeaks and captures my dog's attention every time."
1,Cingular is deceptive!,"My review is on Cingular. I bought a phone w/service and was told I could return for full refund and only charged for any air time used. THEY LIE. THE PHONE DID NOT WORK IN MY AREA AND I CANCELLED THE NEXT DAY. THEY ARE CHARGING ME FOR ACTIVATION even though it never worked in my area. If you are uncertain you will keep the phone and service, DON'T BUY from Cingular. Amazon will also do nothing to reimburse.I see others have experienced deception from Cingular too."
1,Warning - 62650 is discriminated by Amazon!,"Unfortunately for the people of Jacksonville, IL 62650 can not order Blackberry 7280 Cingular from Amazon. When I check with availability zip code. It says ""Sorry! This product is not available for Jacksonville, IL"". However, Blackberry 7280 Cingular is working excellent in Jacksonville, IL 62650. Amazon's discrimination toward people of zip code 62650. Anyway, I sought other business to ordered Blackberry 7280 and I loves it."
5,If I were to have one and only one album...,"THE BEST ALBUM. No questions asked. Bathory destroys any of this mainstream crap metal seen currently in your local music shops. They are THE BLACK METAL BAND OF THE CENTURY, most noted and respected the world-over."
4,The beginging of Black Metal,"Let's put it this folks. If you don't like Bathory then you have no business listening to this kind of music. Now for those of you who do, let me just say that i thik that this is the album that spawned a million black metal bands across Europe. From first track to last, Bathory takes you on a dark and scary ride through hell and refuses let go of you. This is black metal at its very roots. The only reason i dont give this five stars is because of the time frame and because i think it could have sounded a little better, but hey this black metal kids. If you don't have this album, buy it now and indulge yourself in its greatness."
3,This is OLD SCHOOL black metal!!,"I had starting my Bathory collection about a year now and it is interesting to hear the way Quorthon had evolved with each album. This debut album consist with a root sound of the early underground metal wave in the late 70's. The Cd's quality is rough and trembly but most metal bands and fans can appreciate that early sound and like it that way! the bothersome facts about music at this time was both experimental and repetitious. The Concept is what you would need to follow in these genres. Being a fan you would have to keep an open mind to at least witness the band's growing success from their early starting sound to their more mature material. I bought this CD a wile ago and wish i had not spent the big bucks on such an old Cd, but i look at it like this: I now OWN the first Bathory cd!! Hope this review was helpful, if not... please be gentle!"
2,A Classic,"This recording is one of the worst pieces of crap ever. It sounds like a blender badly recorded, complete with sped up Kiss progressions and vomit sounds from the singer.Just know this: Folks who love this stuff are fringe creeps. Weirdos. Misfits. With bad ears and no taste.This is about as bad as music can possibly get and its fans are just plume crazy.Avoid this like the plague.I will now enter the witness protection program now that i have posted this."
1,A Tangled Mess,"I debated over buying Ouidad products for months before finally deciding to give them a try despite the price. This Balancing Rinse does smell good as the other reviewer said, but it left my hair in such a tangled mess that by the time I got done combing it out a handful of my hair had come out. My curls may make my hair look thick, but believe me, it's not. I can't afford to lose that much hair every time I wash it. Needless to say, I'll be going back to my regular brand."
4,VALUE FOR THE MONEY,"THIS BOOK WAS DELIVERED ON TIME WHICH I THINK IS A VALUABLE QUALITY OF THE SELLER. THE BOOK ITSELF HAS MINIMAL WEAR ON THE COVER AND THE PAGES WERE SLIGHTLY WORN. CONSIDERING ALL OF THIS IT WAS AN INTERESTING BOOK, ESPECIALLY FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO LEARN ABOUT THE WOMEN IN THE OLD TESTAMENT OF THE BIBLE."
3,Not for Ford,"Although the book was well written and offered some good information about possible engine swaps, there were no Ford swaps whatsoever. I would have thought that a V-8 swap into an early Mustang or Falcon would have at least generated some interest from the author, but it seemed that if you don't own a GM or Chrysler product it's not worth the trouble writing about. However, the information contained in this book is worth reading, if for no other reason than just learning the various means and methods used to overcome obstacles encountered when swapping different engine/trans combinations into other vehicles."
3,An Old Book In New Cover,"This is a barely updated book published as a Peterson's title in the late 70s, and while the basics (as applied to RWD cars with front engines) haven't changed, the laws have and so have the reasons for swapping in most cases. The most popular subjects for engine swaps today are four wheel drive vehicles, particularly outside the USA where no off-road vehicle is taken seriously without a diesel engine.A new edition of this book could be very good, especially if written with non-US readers as well as Americans in mind."
5,Great,My son loves this DVD he does not get enough of watching the DVD over and over again.great love ithenry j.
4,still going strong,"i bought this more than 5 years ago in a sports store, and they were selling it for 20 bucks (the most inexpensive one). sure, it feels genky - generic and cheaply made - but it still works after all these years. 5 dollars + free shipping is a GREAT deal."
3,Coordinator,"Sufficient for the limited time product has been in use. Although, it feels somewhat cheaply made, but as long as it starts and stops, all is good."
3,just ok,pretty cheap quality and basic construction. No off button. Silly alarm keeps going off even though I follow the instructions to turn it off. Wouldn't reset the timer sometimes. wouldn't buy this again. I'm only timing school speed tests so it's not a big deal but I wouldn't recommend this for any important timing needs.
4,Does the job....quietly.,"I bought this stopwatch so I could accurately measure time for achievement and intelligence tests. As such, I need a device that is fairly quiet so that I don't disturb the client. If you cover the speaker with the palm of your hand, all you can hear is the click of the button. It feels light and a little cheap, but works well for my purposes."
3,Reliable but nothing fancy,The stopwatch works well. However it was tough to put in the battery and I really wish that I cud turn off the alarm and the stopwatch itself
2,not that great,"This stopwatch was not what i really wanted. I wanted an plain, easy, uncomplicated stopwatch. I hate the alarm part."
4,stop watch,Does exactly what I needed. The small manual is notwritten very well & doesn't give much help - but productis so simple that that's not much of an issue.
5,A breath of fresh air. Great for exisiting agents too!,"Dirk Zeller presents valauble information in this quick and easy to read book. There are no ""secrets"" in this book. You will find real world information that will make a positive impact on your career whether you are a brand new agent or have a few transactions under your belt. This book will help you combat counterproductive activites and manage your time more effectively. I have two years experience in the business and still found this book invaluable. If you want to avoid the traps that can rob you of success this book is for you. Avoid negativity. Realize your full potential! You can get there from here!"
1,"Obnoxious, Superficial Rip-off","A regurgitation of sales nausea from the likes of Zig Ziglar, Earl Nightengale and Napoleon Hill with no specific reference to anything of substance but often repeated quotes and clichés. If you are actually motivated by this type of self-congratulatory, sports model sales drivel, well, this is your man. There are much better practical guides to your first year in Real Estate than this(21 Things I Wish My Broker Had Told Me, comes to mind). Personally I would not deal with anyone who spun this type of Slick Willyish simplistic double talk and when business deems I must, I shudder with contempt as I do at this book, which I am returning. A waste of time."
3,Just Okay,"I was really excited about purchasing and reading this book after reading a similar book by another author, but just found this book to not be good enough. I would suggest the book Your Successful Real Estate Career by Kenneth Edwards. I know that when I went to purchase Dirk Zeller's book, I read a review that said the same thing...to purchase Kenneth Edwards instead and they were right. Mr. Zellers book is okay but not as helpful or creatively written as Kenneth Edwards. Just a thought......"
2,Not so great...,"This book offers some helpful advice but the useful material could have been cut down to about 20 pages... This book is merely an outline with three or four sentences under each bullet and it is full of wordy, trite euphemisms like: believe in yourself, tell the truth, stand your ground, don't give up, create a plan, go for first place, and on and on, ad-nauseam! It's not entirely a waste of time but I wouldn't venture to label this book ""educational""."
3,For $14 its not bad,"I come from the world of hightech sales. I've been selling software for almost 20 years. With the down turn in tech I've decided to look at real estate as a potential career change and wanted to find something that could shed some light on what its like to work inside the industry. Given my strong sales background I found much of the content repetitive. Prospecting, managing clients, closing deals are all things I'm very familiar with so that didn't help me much. I'd also say there were areas where the author generalized too much, when I wanted specifics but over all I've concluded I won't find answers to all my questions in one book. Given that I thought this was a good place to start."
1,Your First Year in Real Estate,The book is overly simplistic and aasumes the reader has absolutly no common sense. I see little useful information here. The book lacks the detail anyone would be looking for entering into the resl estate business.
1,I wish my vaccuum sucked this much.,"Sorry, but I don't understand how this book has gotten any good reviews. It is pure fluff. The writer seems to be more of a 'motivator' than someone who can actually accomplish anything on his own. He fails to address simple issues is a straightforward manner.Simplistic writing and convoluted logic. Save your money and buy Gary Keller's Millionaire Agent book. It is far better at showing you how to leverage your time and resources into very large returns. This author talks about beating the average income of $17,000/year. Keller teaches you how to maximize your potential and become financially independent."
2,A lot of fluff,"This book is FULL of metaphors. If you cut out all the metaphors and all the repeating itself, it might have 10 pages of content worth reading. But, your money is probably better spent elsewhere. This is what I get for looking for a book on real estate in a brick and mortar store rather than coming online. It was the only book I could find at the time.There is some good info there, but I'm sure that you can get a LOT more valuable info for your money by purchasing a different book."
3,Well Worth the Money,"I recently attended a meeting where Dirk Zeller was the keynote speaker. As excellent as his talk was, his book is even better. As a new real estate agent, I was floundering in all the unknowns--it is one of those professions where you are thrown in and expected to swim (or sink). This book has made a tremendous difference to me, and I expect it would for any new agent."
2,"Boring, few practical tips",It seemed like this book was written because they knew that the catchy title would go far and make them money. It was very repetitive with few practical tips that will help me in my new career. I basically can imagine that the author first wrote an outline and then later just filled in the blanks to make up the 200+ pages. I would have preferred a step by step guide to what one needs to do in my first few transactions.Oh well.
1,Writing the obvious,A book containing everything you should already know before deciding on a career in real estate.
5,Best beginner real estate book written,"As a broker, I'm always looking for new material for training my agents. This is the BEST book I've found for new real estate agents in the industry. Being a realtor is not easy, this book helps answer a lot of the questions that a new agent has. I would recommend reading this book BEFORE you decide to become an agent as it may help you with that decision. I would also recommend to read for anyone that is just startig or perhaps has been in a while but not quite making the amount of money or sales that they are happy with."
2,Too general and repetitive..............,"I agree with the reader that says this book does not address the real issues or addresses it superficially. There are way too many generalities and while interesting, the quotes and constant sports analogies could really be related to anything. Lots of words with little content."
5,"THE ""how-to"" system that WORKS!..","Bravo to Mr. Zeller! In all fairness, though, the credit goes to HIS mentor - Mike Ferry and his SUPER training organization. Mr. Zeller is simply putting in book format all that he was trained and coached by the Mike Ferry group to do as a real estate agent. The system WORKS! The most difficult part that new and traditionally trained agents will have to contend with is the daily application and the persistence that this system demands. Without a firm long-term commitment to the system agents will get discouraged. Yet, in the long term, there is no better system available to agents in the marketplace today. BUY the book and get inspired and JUST DO IT! Good luck...."
4,Great game!,I just bought a copy of this at a pawnshop and have to say i was impressed!Its pinball in Sonic spinball!tm.Reccomended to any true sonic and sega fan.
3,Sonic SpinBall - Sega Genesis,"This game is good... if you get at least to the 2nd floor. The 2nd floor and up is where the REAL action is. That wasn't a good start, was it?Sonic and Pinball make a good mix if you have beaten (or at least played) Sonic I, II, or III. In this game, unlike II and III, it's just yourself. Playing in advanced (the levels have WAY more than a regular pinball table) pinball, through the levels, trying to get to the ULTIMATE level - the one between you and (yes, as in all games) THE EVIL DR. ROBOTNICK!!!Remember how I said it's just by yourself? Well I lied - no, I half-lied. You see, all your friends (not just Knuckles and Tails - all your friends from the comics too!) come out in the bonus stage, but they don't actually HELP you. And - wait, play the game to find out when the bonus stages come!"
4,Book Review of 8 Plus 1,"8 Plus 1 is a book that contains nine stories with different plots, characters, and themes. The stories are mostly about families breaking up and/or realizing mistakes. With the very descriptive writing and interesting story line, I was easily engaged into the reading. So much imagery was used that the reader can picture the story in their head. This was the best part about the book. Also, the characters were just like the people in the world today. This helped me to learn that no one is perfect, for everyone makes mistakes. The characters gave me important messages about life. Even though many things about the book were good, there were still unclear parts. I did not like how characters were used over and over again. It was as if Robert Cormier could not come up with any other names. The repetition of names made it confusing. This book is overall very interesting. I would recommend 8 Plus 1 for those that enjoy short stories that tell much about life."
4,Interesting collection of stories,"Eight plus one is a collection of short stories with similar themes. I would reccomend Eight Plus One for any reader. There are many good features of the book. First, Cromier writes a brief explanation before each story. This is very insightful for the reader,and I learned many of the ideas for his stories come from his family. Another feature of the book is that anyone can relate to the characters. However some aspects of the book are negative. For instance, different characters in different stories share the same names. Another negative aspect of the story is that it has no flow because the stories are so short. I would reccomend Eight Plus One to any reader looking to enjoy a short book."
1,Rather. . . pointless,"As much as I hate to admit this, 8+1 was so flat and monotonous that I could barely finish it. Cormier's purposeless stories meant nothing to my mind, and as the ALAN Reviews calls him ""a sensitive loving writer"", I prefer the Cormier that writes the engaging, page-turning thrillers that I've read before. Much rather than this insignifigant collection."
4,If You Enjoy Realism and Confusion this Book is for You,"8+I equals nine beautiful and well-crafted stories. Cormier is a master of imagery. 8+1 is a book of nine stories interwoven by the theme of family and how life is unfair. As he takes you inside his emotions and fictional situations full of change you learn and grow with the characters. Cormier doesn't judge his characters as he tells you about a prejudice father in relation to his son's protestant girlfriend, a divorcee trying to win back his daughters faith through love not bribes, and a man who leaves his wife and three children for a women he hardly knows."
3,Eight+one,"8+1 is different from any other book that I have ever read. This book contains 9 short stories, which for the most part are very interesting. All of these stories to teach you an important lesson about life. Thsee lessons are very well thought out, and they make the stories a lot better. But, this book isn't for everyone. In fact you will only find this book interesting if you are interested in relationship books. But, if you are interseted in books about relationships I would highly recommend this book to you, and I believe you would love it. If you aren't intrested in relationship books I wouldn't read this book because some of the stories might make you bored. This book is very intresting if you are intrested in this sort of thing, but I wouldn't recomed it for everybody."
1,great paperweight,"Terrible product. The factory battery has a pleasant little feature that wipes out all data if the battery dies. You have to purchase an aftermarket battery to avoid this. Unfortunately I learned this the hard way. Also, the screen isn't very user friendly. Once you've used a product like the iPhone, this seems very outdated. You can get most of the features available on this on you standard cell phone. HP makes great laptops, but this product is really outdated."
3,"nothing too energetic or anthematic here, but still enjoyable","Much diva vocal on this one. Nothing too progressive, these are mostly commercial and softhouse mixes. Track times:1. Down With This (5:01)2. Mary Jane (6:00)3.Get On Up (5:11)4. You Lift Me Up (6:30)5. Two to Tango (7:36)6. This Time (9:16)7. Follow the Rules (7:35)8. I'll Always Be Around (5:45)9. Livin Joy (4:46)10. You Keep Me Hangin On (5:36)11. He's on the Phone (5:07)12. Turn it Out (2:49)"
3,Moderately Entertaining,"An interesting and not too predictable mystery with a fairly well-drawn protagonist, An Eye For Murder was a good read. It wasn't can't-put-it-down-good, but I did want to come back to it to find out what happens. Though I found the male characters to be two-dimensional and rather boring, with the possible exception of Ellie's father, the female characters were done well. The romance aspect of the story seemed tacked on and did not enhance the story at all. I would read this author again."
2,Not my cup of tea,"This author was ""highly recommended"" to me via a blog on book reviews when I noted that I rarely bought and liked female thriller/mystery writers. I was told I was ""doing myself a diservice"" by not reading her. After she was likened to Karin Slaughter, I immediately bought and read this book... and was sorely disappointed. I found her writing jerky, a couple of glaring mistakes in her timeline. Actually, I liked the storyline, but unfortunately, the writing didn't do it justice.Won't be buying Ms. Hellmann again."
5,1st Framing nailer,"I purchased this framing nailer for a 2000 sq.ft. deck project, it saved me alot of time and smashed fingers. I am planning on adding at least one more this spring before my next deck project, it worked great with both metal fasteners and traditional frame nailing."
5,A winner,"For those who, like me, are missing Brother Cadfael a lot, this comes as a delightful new read - I'll be looking out for more of her!"
5,EvamayI,"I loved this book, the first Sister Frevisse book that I have read. Since then I have read most of the series and have thoroughly enjoyed them. I heartily recommend this book."
4,Worth Wild Reading,I'm not the type of person to enjoy reading but for some reason I couldn't put this book down. It caught my attention right from the beginning and kept me going till the end. The characters in it were kind of crazy but i think that is what made this book so good. I only gave it a four because i think there were parts that were a little hard to grasp. This is one book i suggest everyone reading. Find out for yourself.
5,Beautiful!,"I'm glad I took a chance in ordering this lamp because I'm really happy with it! The pole has a great look and feel. The glass shade is beautiful. And, the price is really unbeatable! Assembly was easy too."
5,Wish I had bought two!,"It's a very nice floor lamp and I got it on sale, so I'm very happy with this purchase. It has to be assembled and the directions were not the ones for this lamp, but my friend assembled it in about five minutes."
5,"""Dragonheart"" Soundtrack Roars On","The soundtrack for ""Dragonheart"" is absolutely phenomenal. The strength and beauty of the music are amazing. It has brought me to tears at times. ""The World of the Heart"" and ""Finale"" both are majestic and tell entire stories in themselves. I highly recommend this soundtrack which has been used as preview theme music for both ""Seven Years In Tibet"" and ""Mulan."" See the movie, ""Dragonheart,"" too!"
5,Dragonheart - Soundtrack to the movie,I purchased the Dragon Heart soundtrack in the beginning of September. My son's High School Marching Band is performing the music during their fall marching band season. I thought it would be a good idea for him to listen to the soundtrack in hopes that it would help his own performance. I don't know if I would have listened to it otherwise but I have really enjoyed it. My youngest son who is 8 - has been overheard sitting at the kitchen table - doing his homework - humming the soundtrack to himself. Beautiful music - I recomend it.R
2,Good trimmer not 12ft,"The unit works well, is heavy but given the length would be. On length it is not 12ft, it is about 7ft-8ft the 12ft comes from the machine plus your height, you also loose 3ft in motor and holding point I am tall with good strength to reach it out at full arms legnth and I would say max 10ft, and poulan are called poulan cos you will be poull-in that string till your arms aches to start it they are alwasy terrible starters ok when you get them running"
3,Does a good job - once it starts,"I used the Poulan pole saw for several tree trimming projects in the past month since purchasing it. The saw works very well and easily cuts a 6"" oak branch in 15 seconds - once it actually starts and is well warmed up. I followed the ""cold start"" directions each time, but it often tends to stall out after of a few seconds of idling and is then a real pain to get started. Also, it sometimes stalls out if the pole is held in the straight-up position while idling or while re-positioning oneself for another cut.It is heavy, unwieldy, and the shoulder strap is awkward, but one gets used to holding it with repeated use. Overall, I recommend the saw for its performance, but patience is a must [and cursing at it doesn't help at all]."
2,Poulan Attachment Series,"This machine seems to be just OK. I have used it with almost all of the attachments and you really have to have the motor at full throtle before using it. The edger especially bogs down in thick grass, the pole prunner works well if at full throtle, the cultivator also bogs a little, and the brush cutter bogs in thicker brush and has to always be at full throtle. it seems like the motor really has a hard time getting these attachments going, and at 31cc i thought it would be really strong but it is just really heavy!!! I would not buy another one and I just hope that it will do the work I need it to do!!"
4,Pole Saw,i like this pole saw and have used it many times. it works well and it is a keeper. my only complaint is the connection strategy developed by the manufacturer. the two shafts meet and are locked together by a knob that has a tendency to vibrate loose. i haven't used the string trimmer part yet and don't know that i will. overall opinion is that this is a good unit.
3,A bit clunky but works,Trimming trees here in the Sonoran Desert involves dealing with throns as all the trees have them. This pruner helps not getting stuck by thorns.
2,Poulan Pole Trimmer,The Poulan Pole trimmer was delivered on time. After unpacking and assembling the trimmer I found that it would not run at full RPM. I called the Poulan 800 number and was given the location of a Poulan service center in my area. I took the trimmer to the service center and was advised that they would not service the trimmer because Poulan would not reimburse than for their service. How nice!! After talking with the customer service rep. they sold me the tool to adjust the RPM on the trimmer.John
1,Junk!,"Heavy, cumbersome, leaks oil. Yes it was a refurbished model! Used it once or twice. It just sits in the garage now."
1,you get what you paid for,"If its cheap, don't buy it.. that has been my experience. Pay a little more for reputable brand and you will certainly have your money worth. Good luck shopping"
1,Poulan Trimmer - NOT AS DESCRIBED,"Received timely. However, stated as new condition. Motor had obviously had gas previously run through it. Amazon would not accept as exception to return policy even though it was not stated as described! Would never take another chance at buying something like this product again."
1,Poulan Pro PP446ET,This item has performed very nicely for what I had hoped to use it for. It is a bit heavier than I thought it would be (most noticeable when reaching for those tall branches)but it is getting the job done. I also purchased the brush cutter option for this and it also does a nice job cutting. It was delivered exactly on time and the cost (I researched!) was the best with AmazonAm VERY pleased with the whole system.-Fred in Sandown NH
4,The title is very TRUE,I think this book is very true. Its about a DAD who likes inventing crazy things. And hence this causes trouble. And a rich man in Egypt buys all the inventions for a lot of money and the DAD becomes very RICH. A Very Funny book which reminds of Tim the Toolman from the Home Improvement TV show.
4,Ducks are sweet,"These ducks are an average toy, nothing too fancy, but, they are cute indeed. There are also pirate etc. versions of these ducks which might make a good collection. I am not sure how good it would be for kids; I bought is as a gift to my g/f and she liked it."
2,"Shurflo Accumulator, new version","IMHO, Shurflo screwed the pooch on the redesign. Their decision to use male pipe threads instead of the previous female threads limits the options for fittings and adaptors. Most fittings and adapters are available with male threads, not female.If you need to adapt to something other than 3/8, 1/2, 5/8 or 3/4"", you've got to jury-rig more adapters; more joints to loosen and leak. They provide swivel barb adapters, but the result is a need for another adaptor for the desired size other than the sizes available. Of course, you can tell I don't use the above hose sizes.They must have thought most users ride in an RV or spray crops. Go back to the old tank design."
1,Fittings may not fit,"This accumulator is listed all over the net with 1/2"" male pipe threads and state in the included instructions ('leaks from fittings' trouble shooting) not to use NPT fittings. Go figure. Its return time for me."
4,3 Pieces Value Combo Of HTC CINGULAR 8125,"Great price and fast shipping. Battery is within 90% of original for length of time between recharge. Home charger is FAST, It says it will shutoff automatically but I don't trust it enough to leave it unsupervised (quite a bit of heat on Battery). The car charger would not insert without excessive pressure and then quit working within a week. I mainly ordered for the Battery so I am pleased."
5,Capinha tchup-tchura,"É, a capinha é legal. Depois de ""Odds and Sods"", fica difícil fazer coletneas sobre o Who. Mas, dá aí cinco estrela pro malandro porque no posso ignorar que houve um certo cuidado na escolha e o material, afinal, é da melhor banda de rock de todos os tempos. Ah! O som está duca."
4,A fair amount of classics,"I bought this compilation under pressure from a friend who is a die-hard Who-fanatic. Of course, I had heard many of these songs before, but it wasn't until now that I really felt the power of this music. Saying this, though, I mean mostly their earlier songs, all the way to Baba O Riley and Won't Get Fooled Again. The cleaned-up hard rock stuff they did in the late 70's doesn't sound so very revolutionary.But. The sheer intensity of My Generation, Substitute or I Can See For Miles is guaranteed to make any rock'n'roll maniac shiver. Even though I feel I paid for some average stuff buying this cd, it seems very hard to get it out of my player. Very fine."
4,Jolly Good,"This compilation comtains all of the Who's Chart topping hits and all of their top 10 singles. ""Won't Get Fooled Again,"" ""My Generation,"" and ""Who Are You"" are all here. The bad news is that ""Who Are You"" is edited. The worse news is that this is a British CD. That in itself is not bad, but it uses all of the Who's songs that were big hits in the UK. This means no ""Behind Blue Eyes,"" which in America is a classic rock staple. Not much else is wrong with the CD except that it doesn't go into to much depth. The two-CD set is much better."
5,Excellent,"This CD is phenomeonal! I have always been a huge fan of the Stones, but after listening to this one, The Who may be even better than the Stones. The spacing of the songs throughtout is perfect. I Can't Explain is a great opener. My Generation is well placed at 3 as it would be too much to open with but it is a song you really look forward to hearing. The best song the who ever did, Won't Get Fooled Again, is built up well by being the 14th track. Hell, it may be the best song anyone ever did. I am especially pleased that the full length verison made the collection. This maybe the best greatest hits/best of collection anywhere. The Stones' Hot Rocks and the Beatles' Red and Blue Albums are incredible singles collections but not even they can touch this one. Every song, except for Boris the Spider, which I don't care for, is great. No fillers."
2,Incomplete-,"As an ardent Who fan and Pete Townshend devotee, I would discourage nascent Who fans from purchasing this album. The inclusion of `Pinball Wizard' and `5:15' as singular tracks is unconscionable. These tracks MUST be taken in context with the album that they were originally featured on, those being `Tommy', and `Quadrophenia', respectively. Buy `Tommy', and as Anita told William in `Almost Famous', ""Light a candle when you listen to this, and you will see your future-"""
5,Great cd to take your first sample of the Greatest Rock Band,"This CD was the first WHO cd that I bought. At the time I knew not much about the greatest rock band to ever grace the stage. When I heard this CD I was mad at what I missed out on, all tracks are great but could have included a few more like behind blue eyes and love an't for keeping from odds and sods. If you like this album you have to get all of THE WHO'S albums right untill Moon died to get the Who's full effect."
3,Not the Best Introduction,"Since anyone likely to pick up this CD will be looking for an introduction to the Who, I recommend against it. The Who put out at least 3 of the greatest albums of all time: Who's Next, Tommy and Live at Leeds. Start there instead."
2,Quit Messing With Mixes,"What's with MCA and/or the WHO? Why do they have to mess with the sound everytime? The ""delxue"" My Generation is anything but (not without the mono mix) Maximum R&B has a different version of Happy Jack (check out the drums). This compiliation messes with Pinball Wizard - after the bridge listen to the power chord crashes - only 2 (supposed to be 3). Not to mention yet another truncated Who Are You? Why is it so hard to add the extra 1:30 or whatever it is? Where is Relay? If you want a great Who compiliation best to burn your own because you can't get it from MCA in one package."
2,WAY Out of Date,"I bought this CD long before ""The Who: The Ultimate Collection"" came out. Even when I bought it, I thought it was a regrettable compromise... sure it was missing some extremely awesome songs, but it was the best compilation and I didn't want to buy too many Who CDs. Now of course (or rather since 2002), The Who: The Ultimate Collection has made ""My Generation"" a complete waste of money.DO NOT BUY THIS CD (Unless you get it used for a 1 or 2 dollars, anything more and it is not worth it)"
4,A good starting point for future diehards...,"Finally, an affordable collection of the cream-of-the-crop tunes from one of rock's greatest all-time bands: The Who. Sure, there is some re-mixing and remastering on a few of the songs, but no matter what, there's no way to ruin a song like ""Baba O'Riley"". The Who possess that certain 60s and 70s sound that you can find today only once in a blue moon (Blind Melon, for example). If you're a long-time fan, there isn't much for you here (unless you don't own any of their albums). If you've never heard The Who at length before but are interested, do yourself a favor and pick this one up!"
2,Doesn't have Eminence Front,"Worthless without Eminence Front.This is the kind of hits collection that KTEL would put out. All the pop hits, none of the real classics. If this was a Ted Nugent best of, it wouldn't include ""Stranglehold"" because the guitar solo is too long."
3,Try To Find Meaty Beaty Big And Bouncy Instead,The first twelve songs on this collection are on Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy. The rest of this albums covers the seventies and early eighties career of the Who such as it was. The inclusion of You Better You Bet is the last straw though I found myself getting annoyed during Who Are You. If you don't own Who's Next than you have no business buying this album.
1,Defective,"Very disappointed in the CD which we received. The CD was new and in original wrapping. However, when the CD is played there is only one track. The right channel is missing completely. We originally thought our player had broken. However, other CD's played just fine. We then tried the CD in four different units without success."
2,The Who...most overrated rock group in recent time,"I don't even think you can classify the Who as rock, judging from the lame songs on this greatest hits collection. I bought this CD out of curiosity to see what the big hoopla was about regarding the Who and I must say I was extremely dissapointed. If your idea of good music is non-descript, cheesy, shallow pop-rock, then the Who is definetely for you...otherwise, if you actually like rock music, stick with Led Zep, Black Sabbath, Rush, or any number of the other great rock bands out there."
1,What a [junky] band,"I used this CD to introduce me to The Who, and I must say that this band is pretty lame. It's an utter mystery why this band had such a huge following. I must admit, ""Pinball Wizard"" does have a nice riff to it, but the rest just sounds like non-descript shallow pop rock. Don't get me wrong, I love classic rock, but listening to the Who I feel nothing inside."
1,"The last one I bought, for a reason","Kuschelrock ... meaning as much as ""cuddle rock"" is supposed to be a collection of rock ballads. The later you get into the series, the more it drifts into popular Schmutz like Britney Spears, Take That, Boyzone. I mailed the publisher and complained about it and they told me that according to their research, that's what people want to listen to today. Maybe, but please stop calling it ""Rock"" if it doesn't have anything to do with that anymore. I can suggest the older pieces in this series, but as it went into the double-digits, the quality went downhill."
1,No! No! No!,"I rated this with one star to drag down the average. Remember when Jimmy Buffett used to write songs of real pathos and strong character? I have always been a staunch defender of his songwriting-- placing him above his 70's counterparts (James Taylor, Jim Croce, etc)but it seems there is nothing left to defend. He has become this lifeless, tiresome theme park ride that so many suburban pirates want to get on board. Shallow, cloying, and embarassing. Have another Corona, Jimmy, they must pay well."
1,Another later career bomb,"I bought this CD along with Barometer Soup to round out my collection of Jimmy Buffett albums/cd. I can now say I own them all, and as I expected, this one is as bad as ""Hot Water"". There's nothing new here; the writing and singing are tired and worn out. Pretty bad stuff."
5,True Staying Power,"Recently, I have become fascinated with a series of Buffett albums from the 1990's. I started out listening more closely to Barometer Soup, then Fruitcakes, and now Banana Wind. Really, in contrast to his earlier works, or ""hits"", these songs have a real amount of emotional depth. Buffett's songwriting has come a long way from Margaritaville. In all of these albums, the musical compositions are beautiful, and the lyrics are very thoughtful and clever. Out of all these I think Banana Wind is the best. There is not a bad song on here. I have been to Key West, Florida multiple times and I have noticed that, if I'm in a bar or restaurant that is playing a recording of Jimmy Buffett, it is usually Banana Wind. The thought that residents and employees who are all surely sick of even hearing the name Jimmy Buffett, can still listen and enjoy this album, is a true testament to its greatness."
4,Write what you know about - Excellent CD,"""I came with nomad feet and some wanderin toes that walk on my longboard and hang off the nose."" - School boy heart. Best song on the album. Jimmy again brings his storytelling and Island music to take us away. Jimmy is truly ""The great escape artist"" and again puts out a good feelin FUN album for us to enjoy."
5,Keep going Buffett!,This is one of my favorites from Jimmy. It's kind of a grown up Buffett singing. I love it!
2,"Just like one of the songs on here; ""OVERKILL""","To one degree, I am sorry I bought this on CD. On another I'm not, because I program my player to play the 3 or 4 songs that are actually worth listening to. I wholeheartedly agree with the Amazon review above. 'Ole Jim is not in touch with the everyday living of how the rest of us get about. That said, the instrumental 'Banana Wind' was most excellant. The song for his father was touching. What the hell was that bloated sudo-reggae 'Jamaica...' song there for. Boring as all hell. And while I'm on the subject, why can't Desdemona just live up to her literary name-sake and die and be done with it. Oh well."
5,Brian Toss Rigger's Apprentice,Awsome book should be on everybody's boat. It is an unbeliveable welth of information.Easy to read and follow. Can't say enough good things about it. The folks at Amazon did what they said they would do book showed up at my door in 2 days very pleasant expierence.
2,A Simple Compilation of Rigging technique,"THE COMPLETE RIGGER'S APPRENTICE by Mr. Brion Toss is a no-brainer simple compilation of standard rigging technique. Most of which can be found by reading past editions of old rigging manuals and from the writings of the International Guild of Knot Tyers, or from company product manuals. Nothing new or original has been done in this work; and the 'Compilation' of any subject matter has always been considered a cheap way of getting published."
2,The Complete Rigger's Apprentice: Tools and Techniques for Modern and Traditional Rigging,to basic ok for sailboats not much for other rigging
1,there is more to rigging a sailboat than knots!,"If you want to impress your friends with rope and knot tricks buy this book. If you were looking for a book that would actually assist you in rigging a sailboat ,save your money. Where is the info on standing rigging?,wooden spars sailtracks, spreader placement ,masts head configuration, boom vangs etc not in this book. This is just another book for armchair sailors with very little for the average sailor trying to build, modify, improve or just maintain their sailboat."
3,The Rigger's Apprentice,"The Complete Rigger's Apprentice: Tools and Techniques for Modern and Traditional RiggingThough there is much valuable information in this book, I found Toss's explanations of how to tie knots and do splices--especially splices--difficult to follow, at best. Sometimes his explanations (especially of splicing braided ropes), coupled with confusing illustrations, were unfathomable. At the same time, I highly recommend his DVDs on the same subject. He does an excellent job of demonstrating in person and explaining verbally how to splice."
4,Nice. As expected.,"I purchased one of these for my son-in-laws parents because he is serving in combat overseas. It arrived in good condition and they hang it proudly in their window. Shortly afterwards however, I found that immediate family members of military folks deployed to combat zones can order them FREE of charge [...]"
2,Not really worth watching-30 min tv special,"This was a waste of money. You will not learn anything unless you dont know anything about basic basic basic African pagan systems. This isnt even History Channel quality. There is no debt to the information and follows one man-who gets one shower ritual in Africa. I was under the impression that I would see new and unseen Voodoo rituals but it is a short story of a black college kid, who goes to this camp in S. Carolina and then travels to Africa after becoming a Voodoo priest but the film doesnt take the viewer on a journey and kinda just tells us that this person is now a Voodoo priest but we have no idea of how he got there. This isnt anything that cant be seen on Youtube.There is also very little background given on the Orishas (Gods) except in quick name mentions. No mention on how to worship these gods or anything of that nature. Waste of my money."
4,WOW,"The first major album release can definately be considered a hit. It starts out great, and keeps going. My favorite is track two, How Do You Tell Someone, which some people will think I'm nuts for. I just like its beat and style. The rest of the CD is good. The two singles, track one, Jenny Says and track seven Love of My Life, are a good pick from the album. I would buy this one before I bought the others."
5,If you like the CD you should see them in concert.,"I find myself wondering why this band has never been really big on the national scene. The album is good but it isn't even half of the story. Their concerts have been described as ""rock and roll revivals"" which I think is apt. Catch them at your local bar or concert festival if they come nearby. Or for the full effect look for them during Mardi Gras in N.O."
4,Cowboy Mouth ROCKS...,"....Which is why this cd was just a little short of fufilling. These songs seem a little more quiet than the awesome concerts they never fail to put on. Be sure to check them out live- they're awesome. I went to one, and Fred Leblanc started to climb up on the rafters of the outdoor stage! These guys are the most fun band today- I wish them luck and hope they can make it REALLY big one day."
1,Too Much Country For Me,"It's hit single ""Jenny Says"" is a great song, but the rest of this album sounds to country for me, if you like rock like me do not accidently pick up this album. None of the songs sound much like the first one."
5,Pleased with Service,Received product in less than one week on standard shipping which is great transit from Georgia to California. Received a Kodak Ektagraphic III E model which was an upgrade to the Model 4200. Great since it replaced an old Carousel 750H in whichthe plastic parts failed. I have zero complaints so far.
4,"Mi cuarto,Chico se fue tu vida","Excelente duo argentino de la decada del '70. Letras de estilo simple, sobre temas cotidianos, con melodias que se quedan dando vueltas en la cabeza durante largo tiempo; Mi cuarto, que creo fue su primer exito, da tambien titulo al primer album, donde se incluyen temas como Chico se fue tu vida, Los juguetes y los ninos, Natalia y Juan Simon, canciones que una vez escuchadas nosdejan pensando...el segundo album ""Vivencia"" editado en el '75 tambien incluye temas del estilo incofundible del duo, ""mama probeta"" "" encontrarlo todo en ...""""pupitre marron"". Despues de mas de 30 anos, reencuentro a Vivencia y nada menos que en japon y no los voy a perder otra vez, asi es que tratare de conseguir los albunes que me faltan.desde Japon, Seiji"
1,WARNING! VERY dangerous!,"It did pull the hair on my arm a bit, but I learned how to put it on so it wouldn't do that. All in all, a good bracelet -- sturdy, took some beating. HOWEVER, the medical symbol came off within two months. Without that there, it really has no purpose and I can do nothing but throw it away. The really bad thing is, I have no idea when it came off, and it may not have been the very first time I took it off for a shower after the insignia was lost that I noticed--I could have been wearing it for days and never known. Never again from the company that made this, and Amazon should stop selling it. We are literally talking about life or death here!!!"
4,"Great texture, good flavor","First of all $13 for one pound of this jerky is good. It should be $10 though. Secondly this jerky has a great texture. It's not too hard, chewy or soft. The pieces could be a bit smaller though.Secondly the flavor is mild and on the sweet side. Some will prefer a stronger flavor, but for me it is fine.Overall it is good jerky for a good price."
4,good product-good service,"very good product! and their shipping response is excellent!try it, you'll like it !"
2,Sugar Jerky,">Pros:No preservatives, etc>Cons:Texture is not goodVery (Very * 10) sweet ( as mentioned before, the problem is in the second ingredient)>Decision:Getting back to Double B Foods"
4,20th century lit in review,"A superb review of Wilson's life and work, one which translates to a superb review of 20th century American literature in general. A bit heavy on the Princeton origins of Wilson and friends; but, what the hell, not a bad place to begin a writing life. A very good ""read"".Arthur Bloom"
3,"Sees the trees, misses the forest","This book strikes me as an encyclopedic recitation of events and names, very often prominent figures in the literary community (hence its appeal to many in the prospective audience). However, I would like more in-depth understanding achieved through a unique synthesis by the biographer. Although Edmund Wilson surely could be a good entre to our cultural history, this book disappooints. Narrowly defined ""facts"" are just the ""trees;"" I want the biographer also to show me (explain) the ""forest."" (In the interest of full disclosure, I stopped reading after 120 pages (about 25% of the book.)For an example of what a successful literary biographer can do, see Gerald Martin's book, Gabriel Garcia Marquez A Life (2009)."
5,The One And Only,"Dabney has done an excellent, adademic yet highly readable workmanlike job of capturing the many facets of Wilson't private and public lives. Thorougly researced and long-awaited, it gives Wilson his due,estabishing his place in American letters in his time -- which convered decades of some of the most exciting phases in the development of modern literature,and the social upeavels to which he bore witness. If you know Wilson, you'll learn a lot. If you don't know Wilson, you should read this to find out what you've missed."
4,Only One Song,"I bought this primarily becuase I wanted the ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" song but was a little disappointed that it lacked the other songs from the movie and only contained instrumentals. Becuase the film was shot in New Zealand they used local bands for most of the songwork and then Danny Elfman for the instrumentals. Now I love Danny Elfman, but this was not one of my favorites from him. Unfortunately this one leaves off some really good songs from the movie and I'll just have to live without them or movie to NZ."
3,"It's Elfman, all right, but not at his peak","This is one of those for the die-hard Elfman fans. I'm one, and even then, after my first listening, my reaction was: ""That was a lot of noise."" It's gotten better...it has to grow on you, I guess. If you're just shopping for some good listening music, keep looking. If you're an Elfman collector, yes, this one is still a worthwhile purchase."
3,A Spooky Score By the Composer of the Dark,"Tinkling harpsichords, screaming strings, blaring brass, and moaning vocal performaces highlight this score by the Dark Composer Danny Elfman. While this album doesn't have the heroic charisma of ""Batman"" nor the extreme dark power of ""Night Breed"", Elfman serves up a satisfyingly ghostly score with some nice horror themes to it. Not his best work, but certainly not his worst. I recommend this especially for horror music fans."
5,One of the MOST important books you'll ever read!,"I've been an avid student of personal development for over 25 years (I've also written 4 books on the same subject) and this book IS one of the most important and most impactful books I have ever read. Most important, to me, are the things that I learned about myself and how my life is a mirror reflection of what is going on inside of me. I love how Betsy has created this masterpiece and has written it in a way that makes it gripping (you won't want to put this book done from the moment you flip over the front cover). I am getting copies of this book for everyone that I care about. It is an incredible gift. Betsy has brought an incredible gift to my life, and for her, and for The Mirror Theory, I'm very grateful! If you want to see how your results are a mirror reflection of what is going on inside of you, grab a copy of The Mirror Theory right now before you do anything else."
3,"Some good stuff, but a lot of New Age blather too","First thing I'm going to say is that if you think this is a great book, or are thinking of buying it, stop and go buy GOD WITHOUT RELIGION. It blows it out of the literary water. After reading this book, I thought about it, extracted the principles from the form in which it was delivering them, and found nothing new in any of it. Thompson is not a deep thinker, and not even a novel thinker. GOD WITHOUT RELIGION can deconstruct this book in 3 paragraphs and then deliver a sentence that leaves you reeling. So in short, the three stars are for effort and general good stuff that hardly anyone would disagree with but everyone can easily disagree on execution, but not worth buying and hardly worth reading unless you are really needing some kid gloves to handle you and need some stepping stones."
2,Could have been put in different context,"I believe the idea that there is a reason for each of our experiences and relationships. A big part of that reason is to learn more about ourselves (the mirror effect). This idea has been discussed in many other books. I take exception with the method the author uses of giving Jesus bothers, sisters, and cousins complete with indepth personalities and short comings. I'm not sure how she knew so much about these family members. The information is good, but I find the context offensive."
3,Fun,"It was fun for my daughter, but the drivers aren't always compatible and it locked up my computer for a while."
2,Worked great at first,"My son loved this while it was working, the parental controls are wonderful in that they keep the number of prints limited. However after about 2 months it stop being recognized by my computer, I have tried everything I know to do to get working but it won't start."
2,Poor Programming,"Do not buy this product unless you are a computer wizard. The programming is so bad that whatever machine you install this on crashes a million times. The Microsoft .NET runtime it needs to work ok, is one specific build. If you have a newer one, it won't work well unless you uninstall it and let the program install its own version of .net and directx9.0c (june 2007). So if you have other programs that need .net, they all break. How about that? Thanks Fisher Price! I mean really, flash games on Noggin work 1,000 times better than this."
3,Difficult to use for a 4-year old,"I bought this for my daughter for her 4th birthday. First, it was a bit difficult to install it on the PC. It just kept going through the ""installation process."" We had to reboot the PC a few times before it finally installed.Once installed, it was a little difficult to use, especially for a 4-year old, since one has to keep the ball-point tip of the ""pen"" to make sure that you can active the drawing (connect the dots, etc.) on the screen.My daughter loves arts and crafts! However, she has not even asked us to play with this after the first use. Sigh ... hopefully, she can use it later."
2,Bad Customer Support,"I cannot install the software of the toy and the customer support service of Fisher Price is really bad. They sent me a .dll file to ""solve"" the problem, but it still doesn't work. They say there is a problem with my Xp version because it is in spanish. I still hope they find the correct answer because the toy looks very fun."
1,BEWARE: POOR SOFTWARE INSTALLATION WILL MESS WITH YOUR COMPUTER!!!,"Tried 3 times to install and spend 40 mins on phone w/ Fisher Price CSR.Their website--which they direct you to for critical upgrades--says ""coming soon!"" Nothing in the instructions about the DirectX9.0c requirement. Nothing about the video driver requirments. really inconvenient hours to the CSR. Crashed my computer twice. (And it's not a junky old machine; Windows XP w/ SP2; never had a problem in 18 months i've owned it). Can't believe they'd distribute a product for kids that's got this many bugs/problems. Cleary not thoroughly tested and documented for problems. They needed to hire a better software development agency to build this one. Beware. Beware. Beware."
4,Excellent Creative Fun,"My hard-to-please 4-yr-old niece loved it. Spent 2 hrs straightaway on it. Only thing is, don't let the kids repeatedly press the pen when it asks to save something. That might jam it up a bit or freeze the screen. Unlimited possibilities for crafts and hours of keeping them entertained. Might buy a second one for my nephew."
2,Unstable software,The software is completely unstable. My 4yo got it for Christmas and loves it when it runs. She can rarely play more that 5-10mins before the software crashes.
1,Very Disappointed,Have never been able to get this to work for my daughter....won't install despite having enough video memory. purchased early for a xmas gift and unable to return. My daugher was sooo disappointed! Wish I could get through to customer service but have had no luck yet!
3,Finally,"After trying this product on 2 different computers which I knew met the minimum requirements, I called customer service and actually spoke to a human being on the first try and she directed me to download some updates for my video memory but that never worked. eventually I tried downloading the program again and it worked even though I didn't change anything. My five year old daughter loves this game and being an aspiring artist I think that this toy is a great concept. However it is too much hassle to start up. Fisher price has to definitely tighten up this product design for the future."
4,DACS,"If you buy this product, especially if you are running windows 7, make sure that you visit the website and download the updated drivers and software, the original software will not work on a windows 7 machine, you must download the updates. Hope this helps."
2,It's Okay but not great.,"My son received this for his 5th birthday. We were both very excited to use it. The software took forever to load. Once we got it installed we found that it wasn't as easy to use as we thought. First of all, the pen is difficult to manipulate. My son tried to do one of the dot-to-dots and got vey frustrated because the pen wouldn't draw a straight line. The results of writing with the pens looks just like what your signature looks like when you sign your name on the gizmo at the stores.It does have a lot of coloring pages and related stamps. And it's suppose to allow you to import your own photos, but we haven't tried that feature yet.Both my daughter and sone have tried to use this and were okay at first but tired of being frustarted and now it's sitting in the closet....forgotten.Gayle"
5,Fantastic,This product is fantastic! It is like a Waycom Tablet for kids. My grandson is extremely bright and has so much fun exploring his creativity.
4,my granddaughter loves it,My granddaughter loves to make arts and crafts and cards for people. So far she is loving what she can do with this. The only downfall is the instructions are not very well written to make cards. I had to play with it for awhile before christmas to figure it out. But can make great cards for kids to learn and can download your own pictures. It does not turn off very easy but starts up easily. Overall it put a big smile on her face and she played for hours on christmas.
1,This thing stinks...,"I bought this for my daughter. I have tried to get to work on 2 different PC's (which have more than the requirements needed) and nothing. One fails to load, and on the other the projects come up a blurry mess. Fisher Price says I need DirectX 10, which is not in the requirements (and the app installs version 9 so I figure that is BS). Not happy at all. Good luck to those who try this out."
3,wish it would work on my computer,"I bought 2 of these on sale, one for my son and one for my niece. I had nothing but problems with the one for my son and spent 3 days on the phone with tech support who were fantastic by the way. But could not get this product to work on my computer without freezing even after re-downloading to my computer.My nieces on the other hand has worked beautifully from day one and she and her parents love it!"
4,Hours of fun,"I am not really sure why there are so many bad reviews but I installed this just fine. I had a glitch at first but realized it was my error. I didn't read the instructions completely before trying to start the system but once I did, it was fine. My daughter hopped on and started creating and painting and drawing! She loves it and I do too. It came with the Dinosaurs and Barbie Fairytopia software and it is preloaded with a ton of activities. Well worth the money!"
4,Very cool,"My six year old loves it. It is a little difficult to get started, but fun after that. Menus are okay, just not as intuitive as they could be."
2,SO-SO Toy,"I can tell you this, when I first bought this for my daughter for xmas it was great. had only a few problems with the program while trying to install it and also while trying to run the program itself. It would constantly have to be uninstalled then reinstalled whenever I had extra discs for it installed. When it worked it was great. But now after only 9 months of having and not using it for 6 months, it is shot. The usb plug doesn't work so it won't even power on, the computer acknowledges it and starts downloading drivers for it but that is all. Nothing else. Overall I would say that if you get one that actually works great and I hope that it works for ya, if you get one that doesn't, don't try and buy another one, just return it and get something else."
1,Great concept - horrible software. Dont bother buying this junk.,"I bought this for my three youngest (2 girls & 1 boy; ages range from 3-8) Anyway, they love playing with the DACS, when we can get it to work. No joke, I've had to uninstall and reinstall this program (along with the additional 4 software discs that I got for it) 3 times - and now I'm on my 4th reinstall, and I'm having issues with the installation alone! I can't figure out what the deal is - I know its NOT my computer, because it's well over the specs required... I'm just horribly frustrated that Fisher Price would put out such a low quality item, but it cost me more than it's worth."
1,This toy doesn't work,"I have a new SONY vaio computer with MORE than enough memory, ram, video card specs, etc to run this toy. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work. I installed it, the kids played with it once, and now I turn it on and it does NOTHING. The kids are chomping at the bait...running around all excited to play and I'm stuck here for 2 hours trying to get the thing to turn on. DEFINITELY not fun!!!"
3,Good toy for little kids,"Nice toy, but software you have to buy it separate, and there is only four titles."
2,Fun but very limited toy,My grandchildren enjoyed playing with this toy but the setup to the computer was awkward and very un-user friendly to go back to computer use. Very limited software available. This toy did not last a year before it broke and had to be replaced. AS IT IS NOW would not recommend this toy to others.
1,The software is HORRIBLE.....,"It's essentially a tablet attached to a paint program, but they've set it up so it can't be used as a functional tablet, so its life expectancy in the house isn't going to be long. Once the novelty wears off my kids are back to using the free 'Tux Paint' program which is far more functional. Then it takes control of your computer, so you can't just shut the Window down in XP, and I'm not able to turn it off with the table, so I have to play with control/alt/delete to shut it down. Really, I'm not a programmer, but I could have programmed in basic an Atari 800 to do pretty much everything this device does. It isn't doing anything complex, so to have the software function like this is really inexcusable."
1,Horrible product that doesn't work,"Fisher-Price Digital Arts & Crafts StudioMy daughter received this as a gift from her grandmother for Christmas, and what a disappointment! I'm very computer savvy, but after spending 3 hours trying to get it to work, I finally gave up. The thing locked up all the time, each section (dot to dot, coloring, etc.) had squiggly lines through everything and did not clear up, even after I made sure all the graphics settings matched the product specs. I too had no luck reaching a live person at Fisher Price customer service, and their web page support is nothing more than a copy of the 2-page product manual and a phone number. I can't believe they haven't responded to their customers with at least some mention that they intend to provide a software patch. I will never purchase a Fisher Price product again."
4,"Love this toy, but...","I really like this creative toy for my 8 year old girl, who is totally into crafting and making things. The only problem with it that I've found is that after she uses it on my computer, I have to do a restart because it makes my programs behave strangely. Like, when I'm attempting to type an email and I have to use the ""g"" key, Google will automatically open up. After I restart, though, its fine again. ???"
1,Can't rate it if you can't use it...,"We have still been unable to work out all the kinks in this software to get it to work. I guess i should have done some research on the software I purchased for my 3 yr old. As it turns out, everyone who buys this item has this problem. I thought anything with the Fisher-Price label on it meant ""satisfaction guaranteed"". To charge nearly $[...]. for this toy, and it be such a disappointment~ no, we were not satified with this purchase at all!"
4,Fun for both,"A little too advanced for my 3 1/2 yo grandaughter, but I was aware of this from the start. Spend a lot of time with her working on the understanding of the correct usage, but that is the reason I bought it, to spend time together! I'm confident in the future she will get the hang of it, many projects and fun things available to do. Plus additional software is available (Dora and Diego are my grandaughters favorite). Fun projects or just scribbling away, gives her and myself hours of fun together time. Easy enough for me to guide her at this time. It's nice and compact ( size of a large keyboard, and fits easily on the computer table). May pick up a second on for Mom's house too..."
1,"Would not work, but my fault","I didn't have enough video memory on my computer to download the software required for this game. I read in other reviews to make sure your computer had all the requirements for it, but I'm no computer genius and had no clue how to check all that. So I just took my chances on it. I wish it would have worked, it just looked like it would have been a lot of fun for my 5 year old daughter who looooves to draw and make things."
1,Product information incomplete,"The product information on Amazon is incomplete. It doesn't tell you that you have to have 64mb of video memory on your computer in order to use the product. It does not run on my PC. I am now faced with two alternatives. One, spend about [...] to get a new video card on my PC or, two, install it on my father's computer which does not have a color printer. This product is basically useless to me."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This toy did not work even though our computer met the system requirements. Upon calling fisher price customer service, they basically told us we were out of luck."
3,Good Movie,Good movie with insight into the SC Johnson family business. This is a familyand business that has been thinking about the enviroment and long termresponsiblity.
1,When I hear this kind of music in a club....,"...I run into the other room.The recent increase in club music popularity, and elevation of dance music as a viable Top-40 option has also inevitably led to a barrage of mindless ""choons."" Case in point: ""Sun Is Shining.""It's a terrible remix of one of the world's greatest performers! No sooner was this a success then Funkstar Deluxe had to come out with ""Rainbow Country,"" another mindless excursion into bad taste. The only compilations you'll find this on are the cheesy ones put out by Ministry of Sound.Try an intelligent, musical Ibiza anthem like ""Groovejet"" by Spiller instead. Nothing innovative here. If you like this, the next logical step is ""Who Needs Guitars Anyway?"" by Alice Deejay and ""The Party Album"" by the Vengaboys. You get the picture."
4,Easy Listening,I like the music of Stephanie Mills. He music is easy listening and some upbeat dance music. The compilation is classic music.
2,A good collection from a very underrated Diva,"Stephanie Mills is by far the greatest soul artist in the world. Why? must you ask because where can you find a soulful voice none other than Patti Labelle Aretha Franklin and Dionne Warwick. MCA now releases the first part of Stephanie Mills MCA years. Not only do you get the Angela Winbush produced I learned to respect{The power of love} from Stephanie's self-titled 1985 MCA debut and the song Home from Stephanie's 1989 album of the same name. This cd also includes the fun Bit By Bit Stephanie's top hit and the theme song to the Chevy Chase comedy Fletch {This is a short remix of this song but if you want the extended version get the Fletch soundtrack which is now out of print} Get this collection if you can and see for yourself a diva with lots of soul. I would also recommend any cd by Cheryl ""Pepsii"" Riley especially her out of print Chapters if you want to hear a voice like Stephanie Mills and also Stephanie's recent gospel album..."
1,ESQ watch,"Loved the watch but it came broken, so disappointed in amazon. Not to mention it was a birthday gift that I obviously couldnt give!"
2,All in what you're looking for...,"Well...this was not at all what I expected. Maybe I was condused. I was hoping to see a bunch of half dressed, gorgeous women dancing in ways that are barely legal in most foreign countries. What I got was a bunch of low quality recording reggea videos that I could have downloaded myself for much less money and in much higher quality. It does have great cover art though. That had to be the highlight of the purchase. Don't waste your money as I did."
3,Novela historica,"Me gusto, pero lo hubiera preferido mas corto, aunque describe en su totalidad la Barcelona y el fanatismo de aquellos tiempos, en momentos lo senti repetitivo.Bertha DeWolf"
3,Nothing new,"Good book, although nothing extraordinary. It is well written, it flows pretty well but, then again, nothing you haven't read before. At times, it turns out to be a bit boring with so many historical details that seemed to be forced into the plot. They just don't come up naturally, at least not for me. However, it is entertaining. The plot is interesting although the characters are somewhat plain. It lacks some substance in this department. This is the kind of book that you would like to have with you during a long flight. Good entertainment but quite forgettable at the same time."
3,Overwhelmingly mediocre,"(I read the Spanish edition)All of the clichés make an appearance; the wise slave, the rich Jew, the good-hearted prostitute, the evil nobles, etc etc.On top of this, the main character spontaneously develops 21st century ideals. Not a word is written explaining how he arrived at his beliefs. We are left to conclude that he arrived at them on his own which seems unlikely.On the plus side: I appreciated that the author had obviously spent a great deal of time researching the era. That showed in this book."
4,Historia narrada desde Barcelona,"En pleno siglo XIV, que realiza Idefolso Falcones como un claro retrato de la evolución de dicha ciudad, en medio de la intolerancia religiosa, de intrigas, lealtad, amor y segregación social"
5,One of the best books I have read recently!!,Excellent Book! Since the very beginning I was captivated by such a wonderful story. In its original language --Spanish-- the narrative is beautiful. a very well rounded story. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves historial novels.
3,LA CATEDRAL DEL MAR,"It's a ""flight"" book. By this I mean, okay on a plane. No real substance to it except a few historical facts. The prose is at the sixth grade level in Spanish. I would not recommend it for serious literature readers. If you're an intermediate Spanish student, you may enjoy it because the discourse is pretty elementary. If you wish to read serious prose, read ARTURO PEREZ REVERTE'S books."
3,"Not great, but a good book","The story and the caracters aren't that brillant, but the historical facts, the descriptions of the city of Barcelona and the medieval habits are very intersting. It's also good for those who are studing spanish, once the vocabulary is good and rich, but not very dificult."
5,Love it - Great Quality - Could Find Nothing Comparable Locally,"Loved this case - looked all over locally at electronics stores and furniture stores and could not find anything this good at any price. It has a lot of parts but I was impressed with how well if fit together. The seams are tight and the hardware is made to last. Plus it's beautiful! One note - in my house it's slightly darker than the picture shows - you can see the bright light in the photo helps lighten the color, but in my dim lighted room it's almost black."
1,"Great, great CD but arrived scratched and almost unplayable","This is an oldie but a goodie. Great CD.My issue is with the folks who sold it to me. Yes, it was used, but it was described as like new...it looks like someone used it as a frisbee.I would return it but I live in China and it's just not worth the trouble. I ripped it to my hard drive and all but one of the tracks plays Ok. Lesson learned...never buy used stuff from these guys ever again.I was very surprised to receive this garbage from an Amazon affiliate."
5,Truly awesome,"""Cold outside"" is the only song I've heard on ""popular"" radio stations, and the song that got me interested in Big House. I was not sorry!There isn't a bad song on the whole album. The guitar, harmonica, vocals, ... all come together in tunes that are hard to categorize...are they country? r&b? rock? -- they're all of that and much more.I bought this album when it came out and I still listen to it on a regular basis (with their 2nd album -- when is a third coming out?!?!)."
4,Utopian Vistas,"Mabel Dodge Luhan was a hostess and visionary. She made her home in Taos, New Mexico a quiet haven for artists. Several painters, photographers, and writers vistited Mabel's home to reflect, rest, and work. This book is a combination of stories about the house and the visitors who stayed there. It contains many interesting stories about the events that occured with Mabel's home, and the people who were touched by it."
4,the dictionary is helpful,and this is a good book.But I wish it would give a solid elementary grammar lesson instead of skipping around like these language books do.Nepali language books are few in number.
3,It's okay,"I like this book, but after learning some phrases, I was told by Nepali people that I know that these phrases are not used in everyday life. They told me that those words were not really the way they speak. I guess the book must use more formal language."
2,uses transliteration but NOT devanagari,"There are two ways to represent Nepali words. first you can write them in Devanagari, which would require that you learn to read Devanagari ( the Sanskrit-based alphabet which they use) or you can use the closest-equivalent transliterated word using the English alphabet. this one just uses the transliteration. If you are serious about stuying Nepali, you would benefit more by getting the Devanagari version ALONG WITH the transliteration - I hope they do this for future editions...."
2,Not enough words,"I bought this dictionary because we are hosting 2 Nepali refugees. I needed something to help us communicate with them, the concept of this phrasebook is great, but it is just too small. It does not have enough words to use on the day to day basis."
1,Worst book to have,"I thought this book would help me but I found a total waste of money. This type of s*** should not be called a dictionary. You can not get any help from this book. Why Amazon doesn't have good and big Nepali-English dictionary that can help us to translate some or many of Nepali words, phrases into English?!"
3,Another for school use,This will help my Napali students with their developing language skills to translate from Nepali to English. They were very excited when they saw a finally had something they could use in the classroom.
3,nepali dictionary,"This is a good book, but i wanted to be able to translate into english.But Nepali spoken word is a broken language, sadly this book does not help."
3,"good survey of words, but nothing new","There's nothing here that you can't get in a more comprehensive phrasebook and guide combo. I took this to Nepal on a 31-day trip, and I checked it twice while bored and waiting."
2,not as described,"The shirt is actually a darker maroon color and not red. If you are looking for a red shirt that stands out like a true red, you will be disappointed. This shirt has a dull color and dull overall presentation.Also, the size is much bigger than described. The medium is more like a large or extra-large and is not compatible with a style of wearing things with a bit more of a fitted look. It wears and looks big."
1,Twin Draft Guards,"A piece of garbage, not worth a $1.00. Does not work, does not look as pictured. I felt really taken with this purchase . It was not only the $25.00 that I wasted on this product that irritated me but also the audacity of this company to misrepresnt this ( poorly made product) as an effective draft solution. BUYER BEWARE.This product should not receive one star, that is how bad it is. Use an old towel, don't waste your money."
3,Works if you have the right door,"We bought the draft dodgers because we live in New England and our front and back doors to the condo have significant space between the frame and the bottom part of the door.Construction is real basic. What you are paying for is the ""creative design"". Im wondering if you can have the same kind of effect if you take foam pipe insulation from Home Depot and make a cut down the center of the foam tube and fit it on the bottom of the door. Its probably more snug and wont move around. Will someone try this and tell me how it goes???The draft dodgers slide around and have to always be repositioned. Im assuming operation would be smoother if the space was smaller betwen the frame and door.If you want to pay for something like this, then go ahead. There are other, cheaper perhaps more effective ways to do it. But that takes some time and energy.It does work because we have been noticing the drastic difference between the inside of our condo and the outside hallway."
2,doesn't do well over carpet,This does not glide over carpet like one is lead to believe by the commercials. It keeps getting sucked up under the door. My husband takes it off and I put it back and try to tack it up. Very disappointed.
2,Not a good performer on carpeted surface,"This product was not a successful option for me because it ""catches"" on the carpeted surface as the door opens or close. Unless I was willing to close or open the door VERY slowly then it would hang up and get dragged under the door and come off.SUGGESTION: If the manufacturer would put a smooth, slick fabric on the bottom then it might allow this product to operate on ANY floor surface without difficulty."
5,with few adjustments...love it!,"I purchesed one, thinking it did look cheap and probably wouldn't work, but boy was I wrong! After a couple of small adjustments, it works great. I had to cut the foam piece that goes on the outside of the outer door because it would catch on the doorjam and then I placed 2 tacks under the bottom of the door to hold the guard in place (it would slide off when I opened and closed the door) and viola! it works perfectly. I will be ordering 3 more for my other doors and I expect my home will be much more toasty. Can't wait for them to get here since it's been windy and very cold lately!"
1,Twin Guard didn't work for me,"The product looks exactly like it does on the TV.. and it fit neatly under our door... but the problem was that our door was too high or too low, depending when you open or close it... and the twin guard would fall out of place every time. I had to literally bend over and pull the guard with the door as I close it so it wouldn't get stuck... it was more hassle than the cold winds... back to the tried and true beach towel."
1,draft guard,"Save a lot of money just buying a 1"" x 6' pipe insulation at Lowe's for $1.94 and great for two doors."
1,Piece of Junk,"Literally a paper-thin piece of fabric with four little foam tubes that you slide inside. Reminded me of a nursery school project.Its a flimsy, poorly made product. I almost picture the guy creating it laughing his butt off at all the fools (me included) who will buy it on Amazon.com because the picture looks good.As expected, it slides, bends, overlaps itself, and falls off the door with one use. Completely useless. If you have to jimmy rig the thing like the other review describes, then its not worth spending money on. Maybe the guy who made this could jimmy rig the original version so people buying it actually get a product that works... just sayin."
5,Twin Draft Guards really work!,"I recommend these draft guards for any one with drafty doors. They are an inexpensive but effective way for cutting down on drafts from sneaking in under doors. They're simple to use too, you just slip one underneath your door and you're done. The only inconveniences are minor ones. Number one, when you open that door they will slip out of place, but it's easy enough to re-position them. Secondly, not all doors are the same size, so you may have to trim them to fit your door, but that is not hard either, as it's just a foam interior. It's too early to tell yet if they've actually saved me money on my energy bill, but it's a step in the right direction."
3,Draft Guard -Does the Job!,"This Draft Guard is not the most attractive thing in the world, but it does the job. You have to slide it into place when you shut the door, but it does the job. I bought it because the one that I had for two years wore out, it does the job."
2,Cheap!,"Even though I had read the reviews I decided to give this a try because I wanted to use it on an interior bedroom door just to block out some extra noise and light. It is not well made and there is still so much space between the bottom of the door (I have laminate floors) that it does not really block much of anything. If you have carpet maybe it would do a better job. If you are considering this for an outside (exterior) door, I would say don't waste your money!"
1,The tube connector doesn't work,"This looks like the ones at Home Depot that work very well. However, the interior tube system is very different...and makes all the difference.The ones from Home Depot have one long tube that you cut to the desired length. This works really well for soundproofing kids rooms, stopping drafts, etc. I needed more, but they're only sold there in the winter.So, I bought these thinking they'd be similar. These have two foam tubes (instead of one) that you have to connect using a plastic connector tube. That connector doesn't hold them together, so it's pretty worthless...you're just putting disconnected pieces of foam and plastic tubing into fabric and that doesn't do much to block noise or wind.I would have returned them, but the cost to return them is almost the same as the amount paid.Wait for these to show up at Home Depot in the winter and get those instead...in the meantime, just make do with rolled up towels...they'll work even better."
1,Awful,"Unless you have doors 3 inches wide, this thing is way too loose to stay under your door. We purchased it to keep mice from coming into the kitchen from the garage - it did not fit to the door at all and the mice had no problem coming through (note: mice problem has since been resolved but we wasted money on this item). Don't waste your money."
3,Good and bad points,"It does stop the draft but the reason I purchased this was to be able to keep the guard on a door that is frequently used. Everytime someone opens or closes the door the guard slides, gets caught and someone ends up having to sit on the floor to fix it."
1,Doesn't work for us,"We had an alternate version of this product that worked for years. It was worn out, so I this one. Unfortunately, this doesn't work at all - the tubes are too thin and flimsy, so it gets stuck under in the door jam or under the door every time we open the door and we have to muscle it shut. I'm about to buy a different version; the ""As seen on TV"" one, and hopefully it's the one I had originally.This Twin Draft guard does NOT work."
1,Useless for older homes,"This might be a good product for newer homes that I believe are a bit less drafty to begin with. However my home that is an old Victorian home and is very drafty, for $9 I thought I would give this a try but the foam slips under my door and can actually make it so I can not enter my home. I currently put it on a window and I guess it is doing an okay job but furnace tape seems to do a better job on the windows."
2,Don't buy,"Very cheap dont buy for a door or anything you ever open on any sort of frequency. Might be ok for window where it is fixed position but for a door it will not stay in place & is extremely light (bad thing) and hence, ineffective."
2,"Not at all what the photos look like, sits too wide under door.","Doesn't fit tight under the door as shown in the commercial and photos. My door is standard size (1.25 inches thick). The two foam cylinders, when sitting inside the fabric cover, sit about 3 inches apart, so they definitely do not ""hug"" the door. Instead, the door pushes it back and forth, and it easily comes off. Plus, the fabric cover must be folded over, and ends up looking messy, like i stuffed a brown rag under my door. I will keep it in for now, since it does block some of the noise, but it doesn't look good. Not worth the price, since its essentially a tube of fabric and two foam sticks."
1,Don't waste the money!,"Non functional, cheaply made piece of dog excretion. Does not prevent drafts nor saves any heating expense."
2,written,"We liked the product when we put it on,however the material is to flimsy and the ends are hard to keep folded in. In addition when you open the doors the material, because it is not thick enough pulls away and traps dirt ect. in the opened crease. This means having to remove it all the time.Twin Draft Guard Brown"
2,could be improved,"I have problems with this getting caught UNDER the door as I open the door it is underneath, then I end up wrestling with it to get it un-stuck. Because it has so little weight to it, it has to be placed carefully or it still allows drafts around it. It may work ok on a hard surface--but forget about being near a rug!"
3,"works well, perhaps best on doors with low traffic","I found this draft guard useful, but found it slides just enough when you open and close a door on a wooden floor that you frequently have to move it back into position with your foot so the door will close. All in all, an economical solution to preventing a draft without having to install those pesky store purchased items to the door using complicated tools. :-)"
4,Works as described,"We purchased this for the front door of our apartment, which leads to an outside hall. Previously, we used towels or a bean bag draft guard to block the cold. The Twin Draft Guard does as well to stop the cold from leaking underneath the door with one advancement: it's automatic. When you close the door, the draft guard is in place. The old method required the bean bag to be put in place manually. This means its in place when no one is home.It is as easy to customize as described. We trimmed off about half an inch from the outside foam for a better fit. This took about 10 seconds with ordinary scissors.I would agree with the reviews complaining about the fabric. It does feel a bit cheap but does not appear to affect performance."
3,Solution to loose fit,"I bought two of the draft guards and was very disappointed when the space between my doors and the floor caused the guard to not fit and get stuck under the door when opening/closing. I finally got them to work by putting double sided tape on both sides of the tubes, sliding it under the door and pressing in to place to hold it on the door. Maybe not a great solution, but now I don't feel like I completely wasted my money. Tape looks like it will eventually have to be replaced, but for now....they work. I suppose if you have a metal door, you could insert magnets into the sleeve, maybe attached to the tubes."
4,had to change the way it fits,The door guard was not thick enough to close the gap on an interior door (which is hung higher off the floor with no threshhold) so I wrapped each styrofoam tube with small cell bubble wrap to make it larger. Worked well.
1,twin draft guard,"This product did not work very well with my doors. Every time you open and close the door, the draft guard gets stuck and it is such an inconvenience."
4,Twin Duel Guard review,"Good - product as described. I needed to modify since my door was 28""+ wide and was too narrow for the adjustable velcro strip so I had to remove and reposition the strip. ALSO, the space under the door was little to large for the styrofoam tubes were slightly too small which lead to the tubes condensing and getting stuck under door when door moved. So i had to go and get styrofoam pipe insulator and cut to size and stuff into each side with the tube that came with (which was a pain). Once done with modifications, it works like a champ - perfect.Twin Draft Guard (Brown)"
3,good enough,"Came as promised. Was hoping to get 2 in package, but I guess I only ordered one. Works fine."
3,Not worth it,I received this item for my birthday and it doesn't really seem worth the money. The material is very thin and flimsy and it just seems very poorly made.
1,cheap,This is a dumb product. I wish I had not wasted money buying it. It is impossible to use the door at all when it is on. I have tried several doors. You have to reinstall it every time you open the door.
4,easy to set up,"pretty simple, has two styrofoam inserts that can be cut to size. the only problem is if you have a larger than normal gap at the bottom of your door, this draft guard will move around while you open/close the door."
2,Poor fit means leaves lots of draft,"This product would be great if the user could adjust it to the thickness of the door. With a thinner door, there is no obvious way to get the draft guard to snug up against the door, leaving plenty of space for drafts to get through."
1,Terrible!!!,Do NOT buy this product!!! Does not fit a standard door and is of poor quality. Very disappointed. =(
1,sucks,I had to duct tape it to my door because it does NOT STAY. It is basically two styrofoam cylinders inside of a sack. Not worth the money at all.
2,Misrepresented!,"The twin draft guard does not work nearly as well as represented. It does not stay in place, and it does not fit snugly enough to the door to actually prevent drafts. The foam insert is not substantial enough to effectively prevent air from passing through. I could make a better one myself. I gave it 2 stars only because I left it in place so as not to totally waste money, and it provided the model for me to make my own draft stopper."
3,"Can work, with modification...","I have an old house. Some of the doors have larger than ""normal"" gaps under the bottom, and as mentioned, the foam that comes with the blocker might slip under the door. (I've also noticed that the pockets for the foam are too big and looks sloppy). I bought a bag of polyester fiberfill from the fabric store, threw out the foam tubes that are included, and stuffed it full of batting. It works and, I think, looks better. One bag of fiberfill costs just a couple more bucks, and I've filled two blockers so far and have plenty left. It is kind of stupid to buy a product, throw part of it out and then have to do work on it to make it usable, but I figure it saves me the hassle of having to sew a shell from scratch."
2,Flimsy,"The foam is flimsy and doesn't fill the sleeves. Haven't had any problems with the opening/closing, though I don't have a carpet to create friction. Add sand or rice for weight and better insulation. A needle, scissors, some string, and an old pair of pants will save you some money."
2,"Loose, not very good quality","I agree with some of the other reviews, this really isn't a quality product. Anybody could sew some fabric to make a similar foam sleeve I suppose. It's kind of sloppy and you'll have to do some adjusting to get it to fit right...maybe some safety pins or something to make it fit snug."
2,Pretty bad - but fill with rice!,"The product, as is, is pretty bad. It tends to roll up under the door, making it basically useless. it also didn't slide well even on a kitchen floor, so I had to spray it with a silica. HOWEVER if you fill it with rice, it both is smoother and will stay under the door. That makes it useful, but expensive for the money."
2,Did not work on my doors,This product did not work on my doors. I ended up selling this to someone else on craigslist for extremely cheap.
1,Don't buy it,"This product simply does not work as advertsied. The ad would lead you to believe that this product works in a wide variety of applications. While the product does work well over wood floors with little or no door jam, that is about it. Forget about using it on exterior doors with any appreciable door jam. In my case the only money that went out the door using this product was the $27.00 lost in buying it. Save your money -- don't buy it. That said, the door hanger was something ... and does actually work."
2,"Never stayed in place, and eventually we gave up.","I was excited to buy the Twin Draft Guard as our back door didn't seal well on the bottom and the back mud room was always drafty. Despite advertiser assurances that it would stay in place under the door, we had a terrible time keeping it in place as we shut the door. The styrofoam tube on the outside of the door was quickly smashed up from being closed into the door frame. After a few weeks of effort (it did make some difference to the draftiness, but it stayed cold), we gave up and tossed the (mainly flattened) Twin Draft Guard into a corner where it was left untouched for the rest of the winter."
1,Rip Off!,"I would just like to say that this product was a COMPLETE rip off! I watched the commercial countless times and really believed that the product would work. Unfortunately I did not read any reviews beforehand and purchased it the other day for [...] bucks (which I thought was reasonable). HOWEVER, I just installed it in my door and it was nothing like I expected. It is comprised of the CHEAPEST nylon fabric and styrofoam tubes you could ever imagine. Do not waste your money. It doesn't work and looks nothing like it looks on the commercial. I was very dissapointed."
1,Absolute Garbage!!!,"Every time you try to shut your door, this thing rides up and crumples. It is an absolute waste of money. The only thing I'm glad about is that I only bought one instead of two!!! Serious Junk!!!!!!!!!!"
1,unuseable draft guard,"The Twin Draft Guard does not glide along the floor smoothly into place as the ad shows. If you notice, some of the doors used in the ad are interior doors. The Draft Guard gets caught up on the door jamb of an exterior door and makes it very hard to get the door closed."
1,Styrofoam and cloth,"The box this comes in is very lite. I thought when I picked it up I had an empty box. Not the case! You get 4 tubes made out of styrofoam. You get thin fabric to put the tubes in. That is all.You can go by styrofoam for a few bucks and get an old shirt and make a better one.This is a joke! Now they are selling a draft guard stopper. Ha. I guess they finally realzied people do not like to have to keep putting this back in place every single time the door is open.Save yourself the shipping cost. Save yourself the cost of this cheap ""draft guard"" I already bought things from home depot for a few bucks and its warmer!"
3,Keeps the draft out.,"The twin draft guard does keep the draft out. However, it's problematic if you want to use it on a door that has to open frequently. We bought it for a business environment where an office suite opens off a main lobby. The lobby is pretty drafty. It's hard to keep the draft guard in place as the suite door has to open frequently. When it's in place, though, it does what it's supposed to do!"
5,draft saver,"We have an older home and the kitchen floor is uneven,so the door to our back porch had gaps,where cold air would freeze our feet[winters way below 0 here].This fit well and stopped the draft."
1,worst product ever,"this is the worst product that i have ever purchased, when it arrived it was all bent and it should have been straight in the box, which should have been at least 36 inches long, instead it came in a 18 inches box, so they had to fold the product at least 3 times for the product to fit in the box. after i straightened it out and placed it under the door it would not fit properly, WHAT A WASTE."
2,Too big for my door,"It wouldn't fit under my door. Looks like it would work well for a higher one, though. I also had some trouble taking it out of the wrapper because the insides fell out."
2,draft guard,"Like many ""as seen on TV"" products, the product ad looks and works much better than the real product. It's just a piece of styrofoam in a linen sleeve. It does not stay on the door as you open and close it. I was very disapointed, but it's cheap so lesson learned. Sorry, I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,sucks,"it kept getting caught on the bottom of my door, and it wasn't as snug on my door as they try to show on tv"
1,Ugh!,"Although I was so excited to get this product, it doesn't fit and/or stay under my door. From the start, I knew I was in trouble when the material wouldn't fold and take the correct shape to hug my door......downhill from there.I'll stick to the snake-shaped, sand or cloth filled draft dodgers that you just place at the base of the door(s)."
5,Twin Draft Guard,This product I love. It stopped the drafts you get under your door. I wouldrecommend this to anyone. Great Product!
5,these are great,With winter approaching I love having these! They also prevent the sneaky little bugs that like to slide in to from getting in!!
3,Noise Reduction,I think it is great for reducing some of the noise that travels in the hallways. Basically the sound comes in under the door and it amplifies basically using your living space as a speaker. This blocks or at least muffles the sounds that we have been hearing...I was surprised that it was only made out of a a light styrofoam material. I was thinking it should be something a little more heavier and dense. But for the most part it keeps a lot of air out and the sounds are now muffled by at least 70% I barely hear anything outside my door unless the people are being really loud.
2,Twin Draft Guard,"Very cheap. You get what you pay for. It thought it would be better. If you cut it too short, you lose."
2,This won't work for everyone,"The product will work best if the bottom of the door is nearly flush with the floor. If there is a gap of a quarter inch or larger between the door and the floor, the draft guard will not fit tightly, and you must reposition it every time you open the door. The price with shipping was nearly $16, and thus the product seems overpriced."
1,doors will not close,"I put one of these on both my front and back dooors.I don't get it.When I attempt to close the door, the guard catches on the door jam and the door will not close unless Ibend down, lift up the guard facing outside, and pull it over the jam.Who wants to stoop over and lift the stupid thing up every time?Am I doing something wrong? As is, it's an extremely poor product."
3,Window usage?,"Got this for a family member who wanted to try the window application option. It fit into the slide track fairly well, but was a little too short to do the job completely. Otherwise, no complaints."
2,You must have a flat floor,"This will only work if your floor is flat and does not have a wooden ledge on the side the door (when you close the door) like mine. I had to buy velcroe straps to stick the cheap fabric & the door, so it can hold together and not bunch up."
3,Made 1 good one Out of 2 loose ones,"I received the buy one get one free. Just like many others, the item was loose due to the small size of foam inserts. I only needed one so i cut all foam inserts down the center and taped 3 together with packing tape. Made it fit perfect and works great now. Others have just bought new foam inserts at lowes, home depot, etc. Whatever works for you."
3,Not good for all doors,This worked really well on my doors that were flush to the floor but my frontroom door is an inch higher when open and the guard won't stay on. I tried using double-sided tape to keep it on but after opening/closing the door several times it fell off. On the doors that are flush to the floor it works great and does keep the drafts out.
2,good idea but it doesn't work god,"Easy to install and a good idea, but it slides when the door is opened and you have to adjust it to close the door."
3,It's a toss up.,"I read all of the feedback and was hopeful that the product was right for me. Initially the product worked like a charm. It definitely helped keep out the draft. There's no question about that. But after two weeks, the darn thing began to get stuck and we'd have trouble opening and closing the door. While I think the product is still most likely useful for certain situations, it didn't work out too well for me.I would say try it anyway. It may be your Knight in shining armor when the chillies come to keep you freezing."
1,Wow,I honestly can't believe anyone would pay for this. It's a piece of fabric and two pieces of foam.Enough said.
1,Please save your money,"Please don't try it. I was desperate for something to keep the drafts out, and after much debating back and forth I figured I would give it a try. How bad could it really be? It is completely worthless. You have to cut them down yourselves and slide them into the brown cloth you see in the photos. Not easy, not effective. Truly, I ended up throwing it all in the garbage. I could find no use for any of it. It is flimsy, the styrofoam is weak so it doesn't really keep the draft out, and the cloth moves all over the place every time you open the door . . . unless you happen to be using these on brand new doors and brand new ceramic tile or hardwood floors in a new construction. But then, in that instance you probably wouldn't have a draft problem."
1,Not worth it,"Bought this product and was totally disappointed with it. Totally not worth the cost. I could of done the same thing with a stocking and some rice. Low quality, foam inserts come in 4 pieces so when moving the door it flops around. Definitely not what appears on the website pictures. Don't waste your time or money."
2,Not great for older doors or doors with large drafts,"Although the draft guard does block some of the draft, it doesn't block it entirely. The guard isn't snug under the door and tends to require repositioning. I was also less than impressed with the ""technology""- two rolls of foam tucked into some cheap fabric. Filling an old pair of nylons/pantyhose with rice and tying the ends worked better and was far cheaper. Stick to the cute draft guards/blockers with snowmen or moose you can get cheap after Christmas."
1,Useless unless it fits *JUST* right,"This item is useless. I imagine it *might* work if my door were precisely wide enough to fill the channel created by the cloth cover, which *might* possibly cinch the two styrofoam sides of the doorguard flush with the door. But since my door isn't wide enough to fill that channel, the installed DraftGuard rides above the gap in the doorframe, which of course defeats its purpose. (See my photo in the Photo Gallery)Further, the styrofoam tube is bent into a circl for mailing, and once installed the styrofoam naturally curves upward, away from the gap between the door and the frame, again defeating the purpose.Finally: My guess is that there's around 40-50 cents worth of material in this item. Think twice before you buy this item.HOWEVER, I'm pleased to report that ""Get Organized"" (the Amazon merchant that sells this item) promptly issued me a refund."
1,Waste of Money!,"This product is flimsy and cheaply made. It is literally two styrofoam tubes in a chincy, non-weatherproof cloth sleave. It does not fit any of our doors well. Also, it does not stay in place after opening\closing the door. Don't waste your money."
1,"doesnt fit most doors, and when it does, it doesn't work","picked the twin draft guard up because I have a nasty draft under my front door, it doesnt fit right and doesn't really block out that much draft. tried it in my window, and it kind of works. I would definitely say don't waste your money on this cheap product. Mine is in the trash can now."
4,Worth the risk,"After reading mixed reviews on Amazon, I finally purchased this item. The item is super easy to put together and slides right in and is functional immediately. I live in an apt building that has a large gap under the doors and mostly bought this also to keep sound out and it works well in that regard too. The roles on the side are not as big as they look in the picture, but its enough to act as a draft guard and sound barrier."
4,Works with a little ingenuity,"Ok, the product is crap on its own. It's 2 long pieces of nylon fabric sewn together with a line of stitching down the middle and a long flexible foam noodle looking thing down each side. It doesn't stay in the door, and it generally sucks. BUT! If you cut the noodles in half and stick them back in, just for some filler, then buy a bag of cheap dry beans and fill up each side, it suddenly works awesomely. Like now it's perfect. Don't try it with anything but a really slippery floor because it has to be able to slide with the door, but it can be made to work really well and it's cheap."
5,WHAT A DIFFERENCE THIS MADE!,"My elderly mother was always feeling cold in the winter months and we had to constantly adjust the heat to make her comfortable. The heater running constantly at a higher setting made everyone except for her much too warm, not to mention sending the electric bill soaring. I saw this draft guard and ordered it, hoping for the best. It was wonderful! Mom can now sit in her favorite chair nearest the front door without shivering. The heater has been turned down to a more tolerable level. The draft guard was easy to assemble and install and has made a HUGE difference in keeping the cold air out. We live in South Texas and have hot summers,and I can't wait to see how it does with keeping the hot air out. Very satisfied!"
1,Cheap!,"I must have been focusing on the price and not the description. This was not at all what I wanted. I thought it would be cloth and it's not, it's nylon. I also thought there would be more to it and there's not. I thought I could have made one cheaper. I also apparently have an abnormally large gap between my door and the floor (there used to be carpet) and the door passed right over this. It's not thick enough to catch and was completely useless. I returned."
4,Great product if you have level floors and double up,"My new house has very unlevel floors where I needed this draft guard. I bought two and doubled them up to do a better job, but my floors make it a pain to keep this on the door as I open and close it. Not a product flaw though. Good product."
3,Good and bad,"I recently moved into an apartment and really needed something under my doors to help insulate and block out hallway noise. I ordered two draft guards and so far, they've been okay. One fits perfectly under my back door which had about 1/2"" gap between the bottom of the door and carpet. The guard fit perfectly and the door opens and shuts easily without any problems. However, my front door has about a 1.5"" gap at the bottom due to the entry way being tile and not carpet. The guard does fit, but it's too little and I'm constantly adjusting it every time I open my door... that's not the guard's fault; it's my door, but it's still pretty annoying. I feel like if the quality would've been a bit better, the movement might not be an issue. I'm not sure that they actually keep the drafts out, but they do help a little bit with blocking out noise so they're worth it just for that..... even if they are low quality."
3,gets the job done,"I bought these because they were cheap and I really didn't find anything else. Easy to setup. The ""sticks"" are too light in my opinion and ideally should be more heavy and tight. However, it does guard and blocks most of the draft under my door."
2,Draft Guard,I am not happy with this guard as there is too much material between the guards and this makes it difficult to close the door without readjusting each time.
1,Failure,"This thing doesn't fit well and comes out when you swing the door. It's a good idea and may work for some, but on none of my doors."
1,It is a cheap product,"I have just received this product delivered at my place, I opened it, there are 4 small foam round pieces and small cloth material came with it. I expected little decent product. I could go to Home Depot and buy the same pieces for lot less money. I will never order this product ever again. I would not give even a 1 star, but review require mendatory star so I am giving it 1 star."
1,dont waste your money,This was such a waste of money! It needs to be adjusted whenever opening or closing door. Its made of the cheapest material. So frustrating
1,Doesn't work at all,It slipped away from the bottom of the door as soon as I opened the door. Took it off and threw it away. I figured $8 wasn't too bad of a loss.
1,Junk Junk Junk,"This item is for the lazy, impulse shopper (like me). There is enough information on line to remedy the problem. DO THE RESEARCH! Don't buy this. It's a flimsy piece of junk. It's not waterproof. The tubing is not the length of the door. You're better off with the inconvenience of laying a towel down in front of the door. It looked like a good idea but, until you put it to use, you'll know it's nothing more than a waste of time and money. You Tube. . ""This Old House"" and see what the guys have to say about cutting out the draft under a door."
1,Your Personal Information will be given to 3rd Party Marketers,"Without permission, this company gives your personal and contact information to 3rd Party Marketers that will call you without hesitation trying to sell your items or add additional items to your order.... Very un-professional!!"
2,Meh...,"This product works fine if it fits the doorway perfectly. But be warned - If the space under your door is too wide it won't work at all and just hinders the opening and closing of the door. The materials are cheap as well, seems like I should have paid less for a scrap of fabric and 2 foam tubes."
1,twin draft guard - not effective for my doors,"The problem with the twin draft door guard is that while it may help contain a draft from the floor, the fact that it affects the door alignment when closed brings in air from the sides. I did not find them helpful."
3,Fair,I thought the draft guards were more cheaply made and cheap looking than the advertising showed. They do work fairly well though and are a lot more convenient than moving something everytime you open or close the door.
1,still drafty,"This didn't work for my door at all. And, no matter how much I cut it to fit the door, it always slides and prevents the door from closing. But my biggest disappointment was the draft was not blocked."
3,Not functional for my situation,"I wanted to stop the massive air conditioning bleed out of my master bedroom (hardwood flooring) into the hallway (carpeted). The included foam rolls on this draft guard were so thin that they fit completely underneath the door and therefore would not stay in place. Craft store foam and painter's tape made this item semi-functional for my situation, but it's going to take a lot more work to have a solution that is both functional and doesn't look like crap."
4,Could be a little bit bigger,"My husband and I bought this twin draft guard for our bedroom, so that we could run a window unit at night and keep the cool air in the bedroom better. However, when the product arrived, we did not realize that the space between our door and the floor, was actually more than a standard door. It would have been nice to have had information reguarding the ground clearance that this guard was meant for. If this product could be made in different sizes to accomodate doors that have a higher ground clearance, that would be great. Aside from the fact that we could not use the guard where we anticipated, we are happy with the product. We have put it under the door for our spare bedroom, which we are keeping shut off to help save electricity. It has been working great for that room. We just wish we had a solution for the room we intended to seal off."
1,"Looks fancy in picture, but...","Recently I bought this item through Amazon.com. After installing, while closing or opening the door, it often comes in the way . It is very weight less, so never stays in place to stop the draft. I have to buy double sided 3M tapes to keep it in place. The material is not even worth for $5."
1,Completely worthless,"Unless your door is 4 inches wide, this product is completely useless. It doesn't even come close to fitting a door. Even if it did fit, the foam rolls are of extremely poor quality, similar to that of some packing peanuts. Don't waste your time."
3,Works but gets stuck,"I remember this product from the comercials and decided to order it because my room would lack cool. After installing it under my door it took a little trouble shooting. The guard would get stuck under the door and stick out but its every once in a while not a constant thing. Over all, this product works =)"
5,Keeps Draft out,The draft guard was easy to put on the bottom of the door. It keeps the drafts out and stays in place. Good product.
1,Waste,this product didn't fit my door. it just kept falling off. I had to throw it away. total waste of money
5,"Purchased over a year ago, maybe longer and still is providing draft free area where installed!",I saw this product on a TV commercial and had a definite need for it. The TV commercial was for (2) of the door sweeps and I only needed one so I went to e-bay and found this provider who sold me only the one that I wanted. My only regret is that I did not buy two of them!
2,too expensive compared to similar products,"I purchased Handy Trends Dual Draft Stopper of $2.00 at Menards (on sale) the $2.00 product is better than ""Twin Draft Guard Brown"" This is one of the few products I have purchased from Amazon that is cheaper and better elsewhere."
2,Look somewhere else,"This thing is 2 pieces of Styrofoam held together by cheaply made ""pillow case"". Styrofoam is very loose inside, just not a well made product."
1,Waste of Money.,"BEWARE...WILL NOT LOOK LIKE ADVERTISED PICTURE!!I ordered two of these. This one and the extreme version. I 100% agree with the previous reviewer when they stated that the extreme version is the way to go. It works perfectly. This, on the other hand, is a piece of junk. First, I should've known that it was a floozee when I saw that the compartment for the foam is too large for the foam. Second, I bought this for mice to stay out of my closet. I still have a huge gap under the door. Third, the darn foam broke to pieces when I tried to make it utilize more space in the gap under the door. I ended up placing this crap INSIDE of the closet to use a block for mice to stay out. I also went to the container store and bought a draft guard made with cedar wood chips inside. This did the trick. The weight of it is awesome, and it is cheaper than this product AND the extreme version.I would have definitely sent this junk back to amazon had I not cut the foam to fit my door. Sigh."
1,Does Not Work!,I was so excited to receive this item for my door since I live in an apartment where it is drafty. When the item came and we tried to install it under the door it simply did not work! It bunched up whenever we tried to open or shut the door. Do not buy this item!!
2,Nice try.,"I agree with other reviewers -- my circa 1946 doors must be thinner than modern doors, because the product is loose around door bottom. Also, since I have raised thresholds, doors really need to be heaved shut when product is in place. And, since it moves, I usually have to toe it back (toward the hinges) to get the door closed. I didn't, however, receive ""circled"" styro -- mine were shipped in a nice long box.This is a great idea, but it doesn't work well in real-world conditions. Maybe if the cloth cover was available in different door widths? It IS easier to move than the tube-ish ""draft dodger"" I used to have; dodger required me to bend over to reposition it, this I can push with foot."
2,"Cheap twin draft guard, not worth what was spent","They work on a ""so-so"" basis, they don't fit under some doors as some doors are higher than others, the material is flimsy. They are good in that you can cut them to size and have velcro to make them secure but they are NOT worth what was spent for them. If I had known that this is what I would be getting for $18 worth? I would have gone to a local store and spent half as much for the same product OR spent the same amount for a much better product quality."
4,Best draft guard I have used,Very good draft guard. My only problem was that it kept slidding out from under the door when I went to open and close it. A little bit of tape fixed the problem. I'll be ordering more for next winter and giving them as gifts :)
1,Pure Waste of Money!!!!,Dont waste your money on thise product. IT stretches out within a few weeks and it doesnt work! flimsy material and flimsy styrofoam. TOTAL waste of money!!!!
2,twin draft guard,not flush fitting- not thick material to block drafts- required more padding to fit snugly aroung door
4,"Needed some Tweaking, but works",The dimensions of your door are the most important. I bought this product without measurements (too lazy haha) Well it get four stars because the tubing was so thin that when I would open and close the door it was get stuck under my door. The solution was to use double sided tape on the underside of the door and slightly elevate the twin draft guard.I just hope the tape lasts! otherwise the product is useless. For now it's working perfectly.
1,Does Not Work With Carpets,"I purchased the twin draft guard in Nov.2010 to use on my front door which is drafty. Unfortunely, my door opens onto a carpet and this guard does not work on a carpet. The guard is easy to put together and slide under the door, however, once it is in place the door would not close. Also, if you place a throw rug in front of the door it could make it not work as well. Don't waste your money if you plan to use this guard over a carpet."
2,No vacuum pack included,"Way overpriced considering the materials included.The pictures make it look tight and snug.The cloth is way too loose and doesn't form fit the foam tubes. They either should make the cloth tighter, maybe even using spandex instead of the cheap cloth included, or make the foam bars bigger."
1,stupid waste of money,Don't know why I bought this thing. doesn't work for all door types. door must be flush with floor. no ledge or builtin blocks. I would imagine that means that it won't work on most front doors. But I did see that my friend has one and it appears to work for her.
4,Good all around stick,"Contrary to the name (SD1), the stick is not limited to the snare drum. While the sticks play well on the snare drum, producing particularly full buzz rolls, I prefer to use these sticks to play my drumset; because they are incredibly durable (I've used one pair for six years, playing at least an hour a week).PROS:DurableGood valueProduce full sounding buzz rollsGrip is flawlessCONS:A bit heavy for snare drum sticksDifficult to play softly (due to the weight)"
4,my 3 year old stole these from me,great sticks i origanally got them so i could help my son practice for 5th grade band..then my 3 year took over them she has turned everything into drum sets....pots pans lids various sized buckets popcorn tins..i fgure with that much enthusiasum for playing drums ill let her keep em
4,Good Playing,"These sticks have good weight, length, and balance. They play very well and I would re-purchase these over and over, but I broke them within 4 days of use. which equates to roughly 8 hours of play time. Which is good for me, I play extreme metal and my ride cymbal's bell is known for damaging sticks. The stick snapped at the H. I would recommend these to anyone"
3,"Very nice, but why those B-sides?","This is a British import, which is unfortunate in two ways. The first is that it's not readily available in most of the world without import fees, and the other is that it's really short (I think this is due to chart regulations in the United Kingdom). I am glad to have a recording of the title track, and ""Reprehensible"" is one of the best songs They Might Be Giants have ever done (especially that clarinet solo), but those two songs and ""Mr. Xcitement,"" a weird spy music/rap combination that probably has less of the Johns in it than any other TMBG song, are all you get here, and the two B-sides are available elsewhere. Unfortunately, it seems like the days when TMBG released excellent and otherwise unavailable songs (""She Was A Hotel Detective,"" ""Welcome To The Jungle,"" ""It's Not My Birthday,"" etc.) as B-sides are over. This single is good as far as it goes, but it leaves me wanting more in the B-side department."
3,Mixed feelings,"I bought this for the kids (ages 3,5,7&9)to have an alternative way to get moving in the winter months. They really enjoy the kicking and punching exercises.As a former exercise instructor myself, I would say that it isn't the best run exercise session. He is not consistent in utilizing both sides and our heart rates were not in our target range.So I have mixed feelings...I will continue to use it because it is fun and isn't unsafe, but I don't think I'd recommend it."
3,"Harder than it looks, even for adults.","This DVD is a tough workout. I got it for my son, and he can't keep up with it. It wore me out in a few minutes."
4,the best instructor,"this tape gives you the most up-to-date, comprehensive information on kids training. providing an overview of all aspects, fundamental skills, etiquette, and strategy. this product is the ideal resource for both participant and instructors."
4,Great but expensive,"I hated to pay so much for an old DVD, but in terms of exercise, my kids love this one (ages 8 and 9). It is a good workout for me as an adult too."
5,Great lesson!,I have read other books by this author and find them entertaining as well as informative and helpful. Received it in record time and in good condition. Thank you!
1,"""Precious and contrived"" indeed",The writing has a smarmy quality that makes the author sound like a conceited jerk. Avoid this one at all costs.
3,"More of the same, but that's good.","This expansion pack provides a few new items to build around your city and provides three more maps to conquer. If it weren't for the fact that Black & White 2 was so addictive to begin with, this would be a really disappointing product. If you're looking for skirmish or multiplayer action, this expansion is not for you. In fact, this expansion is probably only for the purely addicted players, and even then, it only amounts to a little over two hours' worth of play time.As a side note, the custom maps that you can design with Lionhead's map editor or download from various fan sites do not work with this expansion, which means that you can use the new items in only the three maps provided with this expansion."
1,Bogus CD!!!,I was stoked when I found this expansion pack but unfortunately the CD Key in the manual inside the case was BOGUS! I cant install the game at all because when I enter in the cd key it tells me I entered it wrong which means they wrote the CD with the wrong unlock key code. Because of this and I cant send it back since it's an open package now. Totally bummed :(
3,good addition,Bought this since I needed to find out what happened. Alright add on but I think it could have been better. Start out with only part of everything u got in the standard game
5,"Thoughtful, insightful and deep","I very much enjoyed this book. While obviously it isn't scripture (and doesn't claim to be) it can still help you think about your life, and how you can re-orient yourself to be more Christ-like. Those with the spirit of Christ will benefit from coming unto and following Him; which I feel is putting Him at the center of your life as Stephen Covey has illustrated so well.I do feel that the concepts of this book seem to be written for the LDS/Mormon reader. Therefore without the basic understanding about the LDS church, and it's view on the gospel of Jesus Christ, this book may puzzle, and possibly offend some people. I would recommend a non-LDS reader to first learn more about the teachings of the Church (perhaps at mormon.org) before diving into this book.That said, this book has brought new insight into my life, and I feel I'm better for reading it. I highly recommend it."
3,Third Covet book,Not Coveys best book. Way too many references to the Mormon faith. If he could have had less of that it would be better.
1,this book is about self-realization,"If you truly apprehend what the gospel is about,and about the Genesis account of Adam and Eve being tempted to become like God,then you will sense the same subtle spirit of deception in Covey's book as was in the serpent.Bottom line: Satan doesn't approach you like Darth Vader....more often he approaches like Yoda..appealing to our ""higher senses"". Without knowing Jesus of the gospel...we will be easily sifted and decieved by books such as these."
2,Just another doctrine by man...,"The divine Center is the Mormon doctrine in a generic package. As Covey states in the ""Habits"" book, we all have different ""centers"". It appears that Covey may have written this book from his ""church"" center, as he is a Mormon. If in the purest sense, and if one believes that the Bible is the inspiried ""word"" of God, then all other writings are ""apostate"", or part of ""the great apostacy"" that the apostle Paul speaks of. Though Covey's insight, wisdom & open mindedness is apparent in the ""Seven Habits"" book, it is not in this one. This writing is ""in my opinion"", equivalent to books written by the Watchtower Society, or any other religion (or one of it's members) i.e. selling a certain brand of ""Christian doctrine"" for what ails you. The Bible in and of it's self was good enough for 1st. century Christians, and therefore it should be ample today..."
5,Mr. Libe sure knows how to weave a great story!,"Beyond the Time Machine kept me company daily on the commuter train to and from downtown Chicago. It made me actually look forward to commuting. Mr. Libe added dimension to familiar characters and created new ones with equal depth. Intriguing, humorous, mysterious. I was truly saddened when the story ended and couldn't wait for more. A very creative story-teller indeed!"
2,Too many errors to use as your only learning tool,"Book is well laid out and includes a CD with extras but, items are used without being described, conventions are not explained, and some stuff is just wrong."
5,Excellent Game!,My 2 year old son loves this game! It's a family favorite. Good fine motor control activity. It also reinforces numbers and colors. Highly recommended!
4,Great indoor group play product,My 3 year old enjoys playing with this product although he wont stop at number 10 and usually insists on balancing all the jokers and bars too before he considers the game over. He didn't really have much difficulty learning the rules of the game either except for that one that I mentioned before. Its great for a rainy day when one is holed up inside and wondering what to do.
3,It's okay...,"We have CooCoo the Clown and enjoy that. So I thought this would be a winner, too. Wrong. Stick with CooCoo."
4,Baseball Skills & Drills: American Baseball Coaches Association,Purchased for my husband. He said that the book gave him more insight in to the basic fundamentals and explains the different positions more indepth. He recommends this book for any little league coach.
3,How to Become a Technical Writer,"This book is a good guide for technical writing. Bilheimer explains the different kinds of technical writings. In the book, she mentioned the most important quality is to be confident in your ability to learn. That's true. And she recommends online tutorials for learning different software programs. The book also offers lists of the equipment that is useful for being a technical writer and offers tips on making discount purchases at online auctions and stores. Needless to say, the book includes success stories of people who started out as average people and successfully became technical writers."
5,Excellent Quality!,We love this plate as one of our family traditions! I gave it to my brother and his wife for their first wedding anniversary and they loved it.
5,Perfect engagement gift,The Red Plate has been a family tradition of ours for over 20 years. Mine still looks perfect. I love giving this plate to new couples to start their own family traditions.
5,a family tradition,I was given one of the plates to use as a young mother and it made breakfasts special at birthday times and then became a tradtion in my children's homes when I gave them one.
5,Great Gift!!!,"This plates was given to our daughter & her husband as a Wedding Gift. They have enjoyed ""Making Memories"", by writing the ""Names & Dates"", on the back of the plate (with the enclosed pen).It was cool to see this, I started given them out as Wedding Gifts also."
5,Start a family tradition with this Special Plate,"We raised three children to adulthood, and to this day, they still want to get to use the Special Plate when they come for a visit. Use this plate to celebrate birthdays, graduations, promotions, bar mitzvahs, etc. Everyone wants to feel special and to be recognized for their achievements. We bought this Special Plate for our new grandson and used the marker (included with the plate) to write him a personal message on the bottom of the plate.Start your own family tradition by getting this plate and making someone feel extra special today!"
4,It's a plate,Could have bought a set of dishes for the price of this thing but I'm just a dude. It is nicely made and appears to be high quality. Also comes with a marker to write events on back.
1,Broken,"I just got this plate and it arrived completly broken. There was no care in packaging. I really want this plate, so I'm going to try to get a replacement. We will see if the next one comes in one piece. If I get it in one piece I'm sure I would give this item high reviews, but not until I get the quality of what I order. This really needs to be packaged better."
2,It has not come yet....,"It must be lost in the mail, we are still waiting but I am asured it has been reordered and will come by Friday...talk to me then."
5,very good,"best money i've spent on carving yet. very good tool. andy vodilko , would not hasate to buy another one!!!!!!!"
5,Wolf of Shadows is a top dog!!! Woof,"This book is usually located in the children's section of a public library or bookstore, although not necessarily a children's book. And, in fact, I read this book many years ago when one of my then young children brought it home from the grammar school library. I have never forgotten it, and when library patrons ask me, a reference librarian, for a good read, something easy to get into, ""Wolf-of-Shadows"" is at the top of my list.The story takes place in the future although it could happen today. The members of a pack of wolves in northern Canada, must learn to cooperate with each other if they are going to survive a cataclysmic event witnessed by them and their leadear, Wolf-of-Shadows. In their journey to safety, they encounter humans unable to fend for themselves. The humans and the wolves cautiously move in tandem each learning from the other."
4,Interesting PA novel,"The connection between the wolf and the humans desperately trying to stay alive in a postapocalyptic world is fascinating and endearing. While at times it feels like a YA book, this novel will still appeal to adults, particularly fans of PA stories."
1,Not what you think,The idea and set up of the CD is great. Just that this code on this disk conflicts with my 1999 NEC code book. And often!
4,"A ""must-have"" for all Star Trek fans","With detailed information on Deep Space Nine along with many starships within the Star Trek universe, Star Trek: Deep Space 9 Technical Manual contains anything a fan would want to know about DS9 and the Star Trek series. And I cant forget the wonderful pictures in this book."
4,A really good book,"The DS9 manual is far better than the TNG version. The foldouts are really good, but the the information gets a little unrealistic in the Starship sections. Many of the ships here have sizes that don't correspond to figures given in the Encyclopedia, and the concept of a 600 metre Bird of Prey is ridiculous. Nevertheless, it's a good read, especially for someone who only started watching the TV show in its fifth season like me."
4,Not for everybody,"Technical manuals (TM) are not the most enthralling reads but for those who are interested in this sort of thing, as I was many years ago when this book came out and Star Trek (ST) was still on TV, then I would recommend this, or any ST TM. If you're interested in how things work on ST, and are a die-hard fan of DS9, then if this is still available I'd say get it. There are some great images and details about exactly what-does-what on Terrok Nor(?) and the Defiant. It is also a nice addition to the collection and provides more 'official' information than the novels do."
5,This Was Great!,"I loved this! It has detailed diagrams and information on Deep Space 9, and has plenty of information on the U.S.S. Defiant. It has some information and pictures of starships that dock there! I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT!"
2,Tedious,"While I like Bob I thought his workout seemed to go on forever. I also was really wanting him to be inspiring the way he is on BL, but you could tell he was reading off a teleprompter and the whole thing felt tedious. Did not love this title, but maybe his others will be better."
1,Very Disappointed.,"This workout DVD, for lack of a better term, sucks. Unrealistic approach to fitness (at least for the average person) and horrible acting. I always thought Jillian Michaels was the better trainer anyway. I highly recommend her workout DVDs. You'll find that she keeps things realistic yet challenging at the same time, which is difficult to master as Bob clearly can not do both."
3,"Definitely intense, but not the best","My go-to workout videos areRushfit Georges St-Pierre 8 Week Ultimate Home Training Program, but I like to change it up sometimes. This video is definitely an intense 1-hour workout, but some of the exercises seem gimmicky and there's not much variety. So overall it's decent and I'll keep it in the rotation, but still nothing beats Rushfit."
4,Burn is Right!,"This is a tough workout. I consider myself fit and the first time I tried the full hour, I could not finish with the weights I normally use. There are no new moves in here, but it's not boring. I also feel like I get some cardio because there is very little rest between sets. I will look at more of his DVDs."
2,"Awful video, OK exercises","This is not an easy workout but it is not as tough as the exercisers in the video would like to make you believe by all the grimacing, grunting, screaming etc. The camera work with freeze-frames of grimaces on their faces is very annoying. The worst thing about it was the poor form in many of the exercises, to which Bob was only yelling ""faster, faster, faster"" which iMO is totally irresponsible. This is supposed to be done with sufficiently heavy weight so that his approach combined with poor form displayed in the video is a recipe for injury. For strength training I'll just stick to Cathe. She emphasizes good form and safety in her workouts, the DVDs are professional with people in the video following good form with no grimacing or screaming, she doesn't yell at anyone and her workouts deliver a lot better in terms of strength and muscle development than Bob's."
3,Wicked hard workout,"This workout is tough, tough, tough! Couldn't even make it through the first go round, it may be too long for what I'm looking for and a bit too challenging. The one woman (not Helen) made THE MOST annoying faces throughout, quite irritating. Bob is amazing, nonetheless. I may need to save this one til I'm more conditioned for an hour long ass kicking."
5,Kicks butt!,"This video is great at working out every part of your body. I'm a runner and was looking for a challenging video that would help me strengthen my upper body. Boy does this video do just that plus it works out your legs and abs. It's not for the faint of heart and if you are looking for a challenge, this video will more than meet your expectations."
3,"Great work out, boring as hell though","Do the hour workout on this DVD and you will get an butt-kicking, decently well-rounded workout. You'll be sweating, you'll be tired, you'll be out of breath, and your heart will be pounding. But if you do it more than once you'll also be bored out of your skull.The workout you do the first time you watch this dvd will be the same one you'll do the second, third, fourth, fifth (and so on) times you do it. No variation. I suppose you get what you pay for (and compared to P90x or Insanity this is a nice, cheap dvd), but what you get is an exercise program that you'll probably get sick of after a while.Provided you're working out otherwise, this DVD could probably be very effectively used once a week or so as part of a well-rounded exercise program. Used anymore often and boredom is likely to impact your desire to finish the workout."
4,What a workout!,"I work out 4-5 times a week and I normally do strength and or circuit training. This is a VERY challenging work-out. I like that there is a timer counting down - it helps me keep motivated as the workout continues. The moves are very challenging, although I like that the trainers are also all sweating and grunting. It's good to know it is truly challenging. I still haven't quite made it (without cheating/stopping) through the whole thing, but I really like the workout."
2,mmm.......,"I like Bob but this dvd is too hard, I can't enjoy it, it's sitting on my shelf with Jari Love dvd."
5,This workout kicks butt!!!!,I absolutely love this workout. Be prepared to get your butt kicked and to be sore :-) I've used many workout videos before and I have to say that this is my favorite :-) I have many of the biggest loser workout videos where Bob is doing the workout but in this Video he totally kicks butt :-)
4,Tough!,"My husband did this workout and I noticed he's not been anxious to do it again. He's in very good shape and exercises an average of 3-4 times a week. His regular workouts are pretty tough. He and his friend both said Bob was very very tough. They did think it was excellent quality overall. In otherwords, if you're looking for an ooober tough workout, this one delivers."
3,Burn Burn Burn,I did the long workout & was sore for several days. I did the short workout & it was too easy.
5,Thanks,Product was received as described. I'm very happy with this work out. My husband and I are starting with the small one and working our way up to the big one. So far we are pleased with the results and the dvd itself.
5,Great Work Out - Burns calories long after you're done,"Bob has some great work outs, this being one of them. They are definitely challenging, especially because they're long (an hour or sometimes slightly over), but they're worth it as you get the results you want. I must say though that Bob is a little cheesy in his dvd's with some of the things he says. I have exercised to many of Bob's, Jillian Michael's, and Billy Blanks Tae Bo dvd's, and Jillian Michaels is by far my favorite trainer. She has the most realistic approach that's not cheesy or annoying. If you haven't tried her dvd's I would recommend any of hers."
4,Excellent intermediate level workout,"I am an intermediate level from fitness / exercise perspective. I have several other workout DVD's (though NOT the P90X). I find that I keep returning to this DVD when I want a FULL strength workout. The main workout is 65 minutes long, and there is virtually no 'down time' during the workout.Bob Harper pushes the 'students' in the DVD to go farther and harder and faster, and pushes the viewer (""me"") to do the same.When I stick with this workout for the full hour I end up drained and sweating profusely.So I recommend this DVD - its definitely a good value."
3,They are printed a little dark and not centered,"I am one that loves Ansel Adams work, so when I saw the other reviews I jumped at the chance to buy this book. To be honest I am a little disappointed. They separate from the book nicely, but they are noticeably grainy and darker than anything else of his that I own. Some of the images you really have to look at because they are darker then anything else that is printed in blank and white. The most disappointing thing is that the image is not centered in the middle of the white frame. Some of them are printed high, and some of them are printed low, so they don't look perfect when you pull them out of the book."
4,text book,had to get this book for school. normally ordered it through ecampus for $90 with 1 day shipping that wasn't one day shipping (cancelled order since it took more than 3 days). Amazon it was $60 something after 1 day and I recieved it before they said I would. Amazon keep it up! You guys are amazing!
1,This...isn't a good book.,I knew that when i read the small summary. Its pretty obvious that the author has no real understanding about what he's writing about.
5,Best Multi Ever!,These are the best multi vitamins I have ever tried. No after taste and they give you energy and a great sense of well being.
5,Great Rolling Pin.,This rolling pin is top quality...rolls super smooth...and a great price. My pie making just got easier! Thanks Amazon.
5,Excelent book as a reference guide,"The first part of this book covers the historic aspects of Stereoscopic film making and is well written and interesting but the majority of the book is a reference guide to 3D movies. It is a great reference guide for anyone interested in 3D movies but it is not the greated book if you are looking for an in depth historical look at this genre. If you are a true 3D movie fan, this book is an indespensable reference."
2,bad item-good service,"I received the projector, it was packed very well.. But it had a bad switch for the auto run. I returned it and got a full refund. Was not happy with the item ,but well satisfied with the way the problem was handled.."
2,Didn't work with Vista.,"Couldn't open it on vista, windows xp or windows 8. Not what was advertised. Very disappointed in this cd game."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!,My daughter bought this product roughly 4 months ago with her birthday money after receiving an iPod Touch for her birthday. It sat in her room mostly functioning as a clock and a charging station for the iPod. She's taken it out of the house a grand total of 2 times. The 1st to a hotel and the 2nd to visit her grandparents in New York. When we got to New York she turned on the music and the speakers were shot!! The music that came out was static-y. Couldn't have been the batteries because it was plugged to a wall outlet. It was not defective out of the box since she's used it a handful of times prior to that. For this amount of money I expected this product to last more than 4 months!! Buyer beware!!
1,Not as shown,"This product does not come with a remote, even though the photos show one. You can buy one as an option, but really they should not show the remote sitting next to the product if it is not included! I returned it for a refund."
2,Very disappointed,"I purchased this portable sound system approximately six weeks ago. Twice now when listening to my iPod, the sound just goes dead. The song is still playing, but the speakers have no sound. The first time it happened, I thought it was a glitch and after playing with it for a few minutes, I was able to get the sound again. This time, no luck. So now I have a useless system I purchased that I can't return because it's been longer than the 30 day return policy. On top of that, when it was delivered, it came with a variety of ""docks"" for different types of iPods, but my Classic 160GB was not one of them, so I had to go direct to the manufacturer and purchase an additional piece.When it works, the sound is good, but I am very disappointed that it has no durability and will not purchase another iHome product again."
3,neat travel speaker but better aleternative,"iHome has some great products, this one is nice but carrying this plus the AC adapter on trips (unless you drive) is not realistic. The sound is ok but nothing to be blown away. I personally would recommend getting JamBox from Jawbone as an alternative. Much smaller, good sound and works as a speakerphone too. This is cute for a teenager but not for a serious audiophile."
2,Loved it for a few months,"Loved it for about 9 months. It's been a perfectly functional, low-tech, minor sort of device that we depended upon for music and such in our living area.The speakers went sort of mushy, crunchy, haywire this week. Hit it, it gets better for a minute. Now it's just sort of buzzying, winy, crappy... not playing music. It's ONLY job.For $90... honestly. Shouldn't we expect it to last for a couple of years. At least?Just won't be buying iHome stuff anymore. They're *everywhere* in Costco and BB&Beyond; and, well, everywhere. You'd think they'd have it nailed by now."
3,Almost caught fire,I have a iH27Br and it got very hot and smelled like it was on fire. My wife walked into the the room at the time and unpluged it. It felt like it was going to explode into fire.The batteries were stuck in it. I got them out and tested them and they were Ok. I had a nano4 pluged in it at the time and it still works. The speakers had stopped working about 3 months earlier. I was still using it to charge my ipod. Up until the speakers stopped working and it almost caught fire I liked it.
3,Remote control not included!,"Althought the description says that remote control is included, it is not. The picture clearly shows that a remote is there sitting next to the unit. You won't find remote in the box. You will have to buy it separately for $20.As far as sound goes, you get what you pay for. It's fine if you listen to it at normal volume. But if you turn it up real high then you'll start to hear that the sound is not crystal clear. If you want a big sound like Boss Wave or something, then you'll have to spend more than $70."
2,NOT WHAT I PAID FOR!,"I bought this thing last week and it said it would charge my ipod 4th generation but it doesn't! Also, the sound is very weak. I have it in my office and sometimes I have to crank it up to 15 just to hear it! I'm honestly thinking of taking this thing back."
4,"Excellent, I like you the sound","excellent sound without distortion, everything works perfect I will give a 4 because with the remote control would be a 5, and for travel easier for me in particular I liked the sound and when active the srs wow is more refined the bass sound, thanks"
1,Doesn't work,I bough the iHome alarm player for my Creative Zen 60 gb mp3 player. This player was advertised as an accessory for my player but it doesn't work with my player.
4,Good video,"Robinson Crusoe, a man who had no problems trading in slaves and living the ""good"" life had his opportunity to think about life a little differently after being marooned on a deserted island and fending for his life. He eventually found himself in the company of a black cannibal who he ended up spending a lot of time with Crusoe as they both tried and survive. Crusoe had the opportunity to see this man in a different light than he would have previously and in the end, rescued his friend from being taken away to a foreign country by white men. There a several different versions of Defoe's novel and this one is definitely worth watching."
5,An unexpectedly successful rethinking of a long-familiar story.,"This film seems to me a most intelligent and thoughtful rehandling of the subject. Normally I find an updating of a story inappropriate and objectionable, but this one works well, both illuminating the period in which it is set - the early 19th century - and proving a sensitive study of the effects of isolation on the personality of an individual man. I have now seen it three times and am sure that I shall continue to watch it frequently in the future."
2,Complete Encyclopedia to Hall of Fame Joes,"If you love the 1990's GI Joe Hall of Fame figures, by all means purchase this book. Half of the color section of this book is devoted to those figures. If you are looking for a good overview of the entire GI Joe era, buy John Michligs book and skip this one."
5,Something Wonderful Right Away...,"I couldn't put the book down. I loved Mr. Griggs' invocation of Del Close.For improvisers it's a must-read: you witness Del's clarity and passion regarding the craft.For you pop-culture buffs, it's a must read: you get to learn of Del's impact on American comedy, and his intersections with 1960s counterculture.For those who love a good story, it's a must read: I loved how seemingly innocuous errands became adrenaline rushing adventures, and was fascinated by the reflections of a man who lived a tremendously full life.With his book, Mr. Griggs took me back to when I studied under Del in 1998. Seven years later, his teaching is very much vital and relevant to us as we are building a longform improv community in Houston, TX. Thanks for your work, Jeff. Well done!"
5,You can't go wrong with a little Jimmy at Christmas!,"My husband and I LOVE Jimmy Buffett and we had the chance to ""introduce"" good friends of ours to Jimmy and the Parrothead life a few summers ago in Chicago. Now that they are hooked we felt it was time to convert their Christmas songs as well. We sent this to them as a pre-Christmas gift and they loved the songs! Their two year old and six year old even got in on picking their favorites:) We are happy that we can spend the holidays with great family and friends on our own ""Christmas Island"" every year and even have a soundtrack to go with the memories. Thanks Jimmy!"
5,Love anything Jimmy,Bought as a replacement to my lost copy. This is a great Christmas album with a taste of the islands.
3,not my style,I love Jimmy Buffett but I didn't really care for this CD. The songs were different than what you hear on other Christmas CD's.
3,Christmas island,"I didn't like as much as the Bob Dylan album I bought it for the Christmas island song on the album only, but there was no comparison."
2,Buffett Mails it In,"Being a huge Buffett fan, I bought this, unheard, the moment I saw it in the store. When I got home, I found the album very disappointing. The traditional songs are delivered in a very uninspiring way, most of the originals lack the sparkle of his finer work and the John Lennon and Chuck Berry cover tunes don't add much to the original versions. One bright spot is ""Merry Christmas, Alabama"" which I enjoy very much.If you are enough of a Buffett fan to enjoy Hot Water and Off To See the Lizard, then go ahead and buy this, but if Jimmy Buffett's name alone isn't enough to make an album worthwhile, look elsewhere."
5,Christmas Sunshine,Jimmy Buffett has created a joyful holiday album for those who live in warm climates.Strongly recommend even to those who reside in cold regions because he brings the warmth of the holidays to everyone.
5,Wonderful seller!,This seller shipped promptly and the item was in great condition! I will look for this seller again!
4,Mix it up with Buffett for Christmas,"It is a very good - not superb - Buffett CD. It definitely has some non-traditional Christmas songs to jam to - these give you a nice break from standard Christmas tunes and are really what makes Buffett, Buffett. The standard fare (e.g. Jingle Bells could have been left off IMO). Ho Ho Ho & a bottle of rum is a fun track and is where the CD shines. Is great to use as background music for parties, dinners, etc... The CD is defintely worth the cost! Enjoy"
3,I give it a 3 because I bought it for just one song,I tend to do that...like one song and ignore the rest. And the same is true here. But for the price I guess I can't knock it. I've played the same tune over and over for the past several days and now it's time to put it away for next year.
1,Stilted,This is a TV drama production with poor direction. Everybody sounds as though they're reading their scripts. The sound quality is so appalling it is about the same as a poor pirated VHS tape. Thinking of all the good TV drama productions that there are I would leave this one alone.
2,Back in time,"A wonderful collection of Edwardian stories, full of authentic language, costumes and customs. Unfortunately, they are of the older BBC productions, like a stage play that was filmed. Once you get past that you will enjoy the stories very much. If you are an Anglophile, as I am, you'll like them."
3,The Sweet Stuff,"In so many ways, this is a really good jerky: low in fat from the buffalo, a nicely thick natural slab cut, slightly moist so that it has a nice bite without the toughness of leather, and a sufficiently peppery kick from a nice black pepper crust. Plus the assurance of no hormones, preservatives, or msg as shouted on the big green sticker on the package. The quality is there, no doubt.So what's wrong with it? It's right there, second on the list of ingredients -- SUGAR! This jerky is too sweet! I ordered the Peppered flavor and I was expecting a savory treat, a nice snack for the afternoons. Instead, this stuff is as sweet as maple syrup and not really what I wanted.Too bad, as I'm now stuck with 8 of these packages. For now, I'm going back to the SnackMasters brand. The quality is not as good but the flavor is many times better."
3,jerky average,no better than oberto's in our family's opinion. we've had better in Colorado. The taste was typical teriyaki jerky and the pieces on the whole were tough.
3,product review is different for the two different types they carry,"If you are looking for traditional jerky, you will want to order the slab style, which I would give 4 stars. High marks for hormone free and vegetarian fed. Their regular jerky is nothing like you would expect and I would only give it two stars, because the product description does not accurately reflect what you are getting. It is not thin, dried strips of buffalo. It is chopped up, extruded, and sliced into ""O"" shapes. If you look at the product packaging for their regular jerky, look at the letter ""O"" in buffalo. The name itself indicates that you have ""O"" shapes inside, but nowhere in the name or description is that mentioned. I'm sure many people will like this, but it's definitely not the ""jerky experience"" that most are looking for when they buy jerky."
3,Review,The description and photo on this product needs to be changed to indicate this product is the BuffalOs version of this beef jerky.
2,"Don't like it, prefer the slap un-processes type","Don't like the pouch type of jerky at all, it does not taste like the really jerky, it is over processed, I prefer the slap type. I did not know it was the pouch type when I ordered it."
1,Stick to Epson products,Maybe it's just me but whenever I've tried non-Epson inks they've been terrible. Rhinotek tended to really over-saturate the paper with ink and smelled bad. It took a long time to dry and the cartridge did not last nearly as long as Epson. Also tried their color cartridge and the colors were quite different than Epson's and not as accurate. I'm willing to pay a bit more for a better (Epson) ink.
1,"Weak, light color",It's cheap and the cheapness shows. I was quite disapoointed with the quality of the ink. Will not buy it again.
4,"Great price, but a bit smelly",The price (...) was great. But the ink smells when it's wet. I don't remember the Epson-brand cartridges having this kind of smell.
1,not worth it,"Purchased this dye without the knowledge of needing SODA ASH before it can work or you can use it. Believe me when you can purchase a fabric dye for $2.00 at walmart, that by the way done a fantastic job and all you need is 4 tablespoons of salt, it is definitely not worth the trouble and money to use this dye. Will probably just throw it away."
3,used laptop batteries,They send two batteries and only one of them worked. The charge did not last long but the charge lasted longer then my old battery at least. I would order them again.
4,Good collection of Huxley's writings,"Do not be fooled by the table of contents. Even though it says the book contains ""The Doors of Perception"" and ""Heaven and Hell,"" it in fact only contains a few brief pages of abridgement. That warning to the buyer aside, the book does contain an interesting array of letters regarding the same experience recounted in ""Doors of Perception"" and many other trips that Huxley took. Particularly useful are the historical introductions to the letters collected in this volume. It allows the casual reader to know what events are being discussed in the letter."
2,"too small, not grippy enough","I bought this to replace a $3 cheapo cracker that I'd purchased in my local supermarket and misplaced. I'm glad I found the old one because this one doesn't suit my needs at all. I mostly crack brazil nuts and this cracker is too small and way too slippery to do a good job on them. I'm sure it's fine for filberts and almonds, but anything that works on brazil nuts would be fine for them, too. I can't recommend this model."
2,Poor picture quality,"Bought from Amazon for about $10.00 and it is worth about $5.00. Based on the reputation of National Geographic I thought the image would be outstanding, I was wrong. I don't think it even qualifies as a good SD upconvert.Planet Earth it is not!"
1,Disaster,"I had a grat expectations abut this title... But... The video is definitely not HD - it's blurry and SD (upconverted).The ""plot"" is quite boring, nothing special and breath-taking. This movie has nothing in common with ""Planet Earth"" or ""Earth"". Waste of time and money."
2,Sounds great but was not,"Thought this would be up to par with National Geographic but was real low end. First the video quality was real bad for 1080P.I would swear I saw interpolated(not true 1080p)many scenes all through, grainy etc. Once in while some was good. Then the video scenes> Clouds? Who wants to waste time with shots of clouds? To me this was a poor way to make a product and say blu-ray ready...You can find better elseware.......MY Grade = C-"
2,Fuzzy. A DVD stamped to a Blu-ray disc.,The package says blu-ray. It's on a blu-ray disc. But it's not the quality that one would expect from a blu-ray. It wasn't mastered for high def. It might look good on an antiquated standard definition TV. But on a high def TV you get a clear view of its fuzziness.A waste of money.
2,A Big Disappointment!,As a swimming instructor I am always looking for new videos to help parents have a resource in addition to my swimming lessons. This video has a whole lot of talking and not a lot of showing...for a busy parent this video is a waste of time. I would not recommend this video.
4,great introduction to getting kids in the water,"just a quick note - this is a great and HONEST introduction to getting children in the water - first time fears and all, and GAYLENE has a great approach to very gradually introducing kids to water and hence 'fostering a love of swimming'...i enjoyed it alot and am using some of the strategies to introduce kids to the water too, gaylene is a beautiful role model for anyone looking to do the same, all smiles and very positive and loving in her approach with the kids, yet very patient and attentive also.a great DVD, with later stages a must also for kids progressing, the complete dvd was a bit short tho, only 20 mins, 30+ minutes would've been better."
4,My third favorite NE album,"...after 1984's New Edition and 1988's Heart Break. This album showed that New Edition could grow up with their sound. I still like the funky Hit Me Off. The group actually sounds good with Bobby Brown back for this time. Brown just steals the show on the ones with Johnny Gill singing lead, but lets Ralph Tresvant sing his buttery smooth vocals. And Ricky Bell, Ronnie Devoe and Michael Bivins contribute a lot to this album. Biv continues to do his macked out raps on some songs. I liked the offerings that P Diddy produced, such as You Don't Have To Worry. And they sound nice on ballads like I'm Still In Love with You and How Do You Like Your Love Served. Offerings from Jam and Lewis, Jermaine Dupri, Gerald Levert and Edwin Nicholas, and others help bring the group up to date. This album surprisingly had several hits, proving that NE was just as competitive as Boyz II Men who were already a popular group at the time."
2,very average,funny considering their impact on the business as solo artists they never quite give you a full album.and that's because they were there influences out more than they give of themselves.for instance who can keep up vocally with Johnny Gill? Ralph can sing but has been sounding like a 2nd tier Michael Jackson forever.same can be said of Ricky Bell.Bobby used to have something but it's now Lost.Hit me Off was catchy.Jam&lewis do ok on the album but this disc is no N.E.Heartbreak.they do more Fresher Material as solo artists than as a group.this album suffers from Formula.
4,N.E.,"""Home Again,"" which was to be New Edition's long awaited reunion album, was a commercial failure by industry standards - although it did sell over 2 million copies worldwide. This album, in my opinion, wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that good either. Such producers as Sean P. Combs, Gerald Levert, and Jermaine Dupri were unsuccessful in capturing that classic sound that made New Edition famous in the first place. Luckily for NE fans, producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis were there to save the day. Their incredible production and song-writing ability was evident in such songs as ""One More Day,"" ""I'm Still In Love With You,"" ""Home Again,"" and ""It Feels So Good."" It should be noted that ""One More Day"" and ""I'm Still In Love With You"" are some of the best songs I've ever heard. New Edition's harmonies have never sounded better than on this album.Unfortunately, the only mistake New Edition made was not only letting Bobby Brown back into the group, but not letting Jam & Lewis produce the whole CD."
1,honest,I got this album as a gift. Thank goodness cause all the tracks on the album is BAD. Very bad. It's unlistenable.
5,new edition hits the mark,this cd was hitting on all cylinders they came back strong with this one i would have to say it's one you can listen to from beginning to end.
4,lzepeda,"cinco años con este producto, hasta que le llego el momento de cambiarlo. Precioso desempeño del equipo, fotos fantásticas. Lamentablemente el dock si es muy malo, se arruino a los dos meses de tenerlo."
3,"Solid performer, but too bulky for casual use.","This is my 4th Kodak digital camera. I have been pleased with the previous versions and bought this because I knew the interface world be familiar. While it has been a good camera, it seems Kodak has eliminated a couple advanced features. Additionally, there are cameras out there that do the same things with similar features, & resolution but are half the size. The lens is commendable & the use of two AA batteries is advantageous. the SD card appears to be the leading media for digital cameras, Kodak is wise to stick with this technology. Originally, It thought the dock was a great perk, but it became more ""clutter"" around my computer, however, when I thought I could put it in a closet, I found I could no longer charge the batteries without it. As I write this, I am awaiting a new digital camera - a Canon Digital Elph."
2,Disappointment,"Having been a Kodak customer for decades, I thought I would try their digital line. I had been using a 2.1 meg camera and wanted to move up. Unfortunately, all I got was ""bells and whistles"" not performance. The shutter release lag time impedes anything but still life shots! The 3vdc input will NOT accept an external power pack- per KODAK. If you are interested in 4x6 photos or store them on CD, cheaper cameras will be fine. The software is nothing special or new. The DX 6440 is small and fits in a pocket, but others do as well. I hope to part with it soon."
3,"OK camera, sorry software","Buy the camera, good lens, nice interface, but skip any docking station or software that says ""Kodak"". Mine quit ""recognizing"" the camera after a month and nothing; reloading software or upgrading from Kodak's site, has made any improvement. Now I am left with laborious manual processes of mining pix out of the camera. Hey, if you hate Bill Gates, just buy this software... you'll wind up kissing his Microsoft feet."
2,I'm returning it today,"I purchased this camera as a Christmas gift to myself after reading reviews for all the 4mp and 5mp cameras I could find. I used it yesterday for the first time, and was terribly disappointed. This is not my first digital, and my old Olympus Camedia 2.1mp took better pictures. ALL the photos I took at a family gathering were very dark. Yes, they were all taken indoors, however my Olympus turned out great photos under the same conditions. Of course I can edit and lighten them, however the software packaged with the camera is very imprecise, so adjusting for printing is sheer guesswork. I'll be packing this one up and returning it today. Now I need to start my research all over again!"
5,I will not regret this purchase... great camera,"This is a great camera. I upgraded from a 2.0 megapixel and was amazed at the picture quality. I've mainly used it as an auto point and shoot camera, but there are 7 other shooting modes as well as manual mode. This camera has mostly everything someone should want in a digital camera.Most cameras in this price range come with a 3x optical zoom, the DX 6440 comes with 4x optical zoom. This may not seem like a big difference, but it is when you are trying to get just the right shot.The only drawback, which does not lower its ranking, is its not that small. Many of the cameras in this price range are considered pocketable. Although this camera will certainly fit in many pockets, it is by no means mini."
3,Review of Kodak DX6440,This camera was not what I thought it was going to be. I returned it to the seller and my money was returned promptly.
2,"not very good, and cheaper elsewhere","First of all, be sure to check out the multi-packGE Energy Smart CFL 85392 11-Watt, 500-Lumen G25 Light Bulb with Medium Base, 3-Packbefore you buy a single. Other stores also sell a two-pack for less money, so shop around.Regarding the bulbs themselves, I was very disappointed. They take almost two seconds to ignite. I don't mean two seconds to reach ""full brightness"" -- that takes about 30 seconds. I mean that from the time you flip the switch until the time you see the fist glimmer of light is about two seconds... Meaning that you stand in your dark bathroom for two seconds waiting for the bulbs to ignite. I might expect such behavior from CFL bulbs at then end of their life, but from brand new bulbs? I expected something better from GE."
4,Pretty good.,"I bought three of these to replace the globe-bulbs in my bathroom. I didn't want to have nasty looking spiral-style CFLs there since they are exposed along a mirror. These work great. They DO take some time to warm up to full strength; maybe a full minute or two. Although, since this is in a bathroom, it is actually a nice feature, so that the lights aren't blinding when you first turn them on.They were well packaged and protected, and arrived in good time (not the fastest, but not the slowest)."
1,OakStump Farms Yellow Jacket Wasp Trap,"SpringStar Tellow Jacket Trap. I ordered two of this item. The picture shows the original Oak Stump Farms Yellow Jacket Wasp Trap. The two I received are not the ones that you show in the picture and the ones I was sent don't work. I put the NEW design up 3 feet away from the ORIGINAL design I already had, and the new design did not trap a thing. Why are you advertising one design and then sending something different? The original design was great and now I have two duds that won't catch a thing. THANKS for nothing and a waste of my money leading me to believe I was getting the original design.PS I really rate this item a ZERO but it didn't give me that option.Sharon TaylorYakima, Wa"
1,SpringStar Traps Are Useless,I recently purchased a SpringStar trap to replace an old OakStump trap. I thought I was going to receive the Oakstump trap pictured but the trap I received was of a completely different design. I believe that I and others are being deceived by the photos showing the old design. In either case my old beat up OakStump trap still collects yellow jackets at an alarming rate while the SpringStar trap sits there as testament to slick advertising and wasted money. I would give this product a zero if available!! I have noticed that SpringStar has since begun using photos that conceal the actual product with packaging. You can waste your money on a number of products that do not work and this is certainly one of them!!!
2,Item shipped is not item pictured,"The item pictured is the see through jar with two entry pipes. The item shipped was a yellow plastic non see through jug with two holes. Old product worked wonderful, and thats the reason I sent for a second jar, new product has not had one yellow jacket enter."
1,Horrible,The music is fantastic but the post-production and fake audience sound completely ruined it for me. They used some sort of audience loop and you get to hear the same shouts after every song plus fake audience over the music!!! Compare the version of 'Whiskey Rock and Roller' on the Lynyrd Skynyrd box set that was taken from the same concert to see what I'm talking about. A horrendous job.
5,The best of Southern Rock,"This group is ultimately the best southern rock band out there. If you like ZZ Top, or Allman Brothers, this is the CD to get. With such hits as Working for MCA, Saturday Night Special, and the more memorable ones such as Gimme Three Steps, T for Texas, Sweet Home Alabama, and Free Bird. Freebird is the longest song about 10 minutes. Everybody's jamming. It's awesome. I've had this CD for almost 5 years and it's still kicking alive in my CD player. This is a must! I was lucky to see lynyrd skynyrd do Freebird at a concert in the front row. The only difference though was that it was with Jeff Van Zant. Without the originals it's not the same."
2,Terrible Sound Quality,"Freebird The Movie is a great movie to watch. However the sound quality on this CD is just horrible. There is no stereo separation at all between the instruments. Whoever put this on CD obviously didn't take much time to mix it. If you're a Skynyrd fan, the only reason you should buy this CD is to have live versions of That Smell and What's Your Name. The rest of the songs are available on One More From The Road and have pretty much the same arrangements with much better sound quality."
3,"Great music, lousy sound",I agree with the other reviewer who noticed the poor sound. In some places the sound levels swell up like a narcoleptic's lurch back to consciousness and then recede just as suddenly. This record's also comparable to Grand Funk's Live Album in its hamfisted intrusion of crowd cheers. Couldn't a major label do better?
4,Timecapsule Contents,"Seemingly unearthed from a timecapsule, this film resembles a Richard Wright novel as interpretted by Harmony Korine. The terms ""landmark"" and ""masterpiece"" are a bit beyond this film's scope, yet it's documentary-style cinematography and subtle performances are undeniably powerful. (7/10)"
2,"like ""What's Happening!"" but without the jokes","Uh, you'd think before UCLA saw fit to emblazon their name all over the packaging as being those responsible for this film's restoration, they'd have done something about the sound.The sound is awful. Many times you can't tell what's being said, so low is the volume. And it's not just a question of turning it up, either, since if you do, the next scene will be blastingly loud. Take for example the scene where those two thugs show up at the principal's doorstep and ask for his help roughing some guy up. Initially the volume is inaudible; if you turn it up, it soon becomes too loud. I assume this is because the guys at UCLA were focused on the image and couldn't be bothered to homogenize the audio.As for the film itself, I think it's massively overrated. Sure, an interesting glimpse into life in a black neighborhood in the 1970's, but the central metaphor -- sheep slaughtering -- was heavy-handed and clumsily explored."
2,Overrated.,"Pretty pumped when I bought this... but it's pretty dismal overall. I thought I could handle the poor plot, but I couldn't. I'll go to the playground if I want to watch a bunch of little kids throw rocks at each other. Oh well... Not that it is without it's merits, just not for everyone."
4,best of,"I loved this show when it was on TV. These 4 episodes are picked by Stephen J. Cannell, the shows creator. They, naturally, feature him in one. If you want just a sample, this DVD is great. But be warned, you'll probably want to order all of Season One next!"
1,"Quigley...after school special, at best","From the very beginning, we were disappointed with this movie: filming, acting, story, etc....except the dog was cute and performed on cue. The story did not keep our daughter's attention, except when the dog was in a scene."
5,Awesomely Cute and Loveable Movie,A wonderful movie for the whole family to enjoy. One that shows that being nice and good is what really matters.This movie is all about the special rewards of being truly good. You'll want to watch this with your children and they'll enjoy every minute with you.
3,Good movie if you like Pomeranians,"A good movie if you like pomeranians.So many movies nowadays are either all about the special effects (aka: weak storyline), nothing but low brow humor, or yet another twisted horror movie.This movie is refreshing in the sense that it's none of the above."
3,Cheap protection for cool days on the bicycle,Provides warmth while letting your hands breath on those days that get down in the upper 30's low 40's.
1,NOT WORTH THE PENNY I PAID FOR THEM!,"These gloves are no different than any you would find at the dollar stores. They are NOT WARM at all, I actually could see my hand through them they were so thin. I would not recommend this as a purchase if you are looking to keep your hands warm in the cold weather."
2,what's magic,There's nothing makes it feel like amagic it simply like any other..warm not so I can even see my hands through it..I give it a star cos of a fast shipping and the price..but about the quality..em em..dont recommended
1,Poor Quality - A definite don't buy,I'm an average 14 year old and when I put these on you could completely see my hands. This definitely weren't designed for quality or ANYONE over 7.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"this is robbery, i order Medium gloves and I got children gloves, i couldn t even put them. The gloves are thread is ripped in many parts and the quality is horrible. Went i tried to return them, the return cost me the same that the gloves, so even if you don t like them, you will keep them - the seller will never loose. DO NOT BUY THIS."
1,Shipping cost is ridiculous,"Paid $36 for 24 pieces of this product and spent $114 in shipping! Didn't realize the absurdshipping charge before ordering and after I immediately emailed the company to cancel theyignored my request and shipped anyway sending a box of gloves through the USPS for $6.20!!!I recieved an email the day after they arrived saying it would be adjusted, but still have not seenthat on my card. I suppose I should have paid better attention to the cost ( I thought $4 was inexpensivebut it was per item not in total) but they had plenty of notice to cancel"
2,Not Helpful,"This is too outdated to be of much use to anyone, in my opinion. The book doesn't even have the answers to most of the problems, either! You can find much more information on fractions on the internet, for free!"
5,"I Love Gary Allan!! Great Vocals &, Music",I am working on getting all of Gary Allan's released cd's - I believe I have one left to buy. Used Heart for Sale is a wonderful addition to the collection I already have - and I enjoy listening to it. Great Music!
5,used heart,I own all of G.A.'s cds this was another great addition. I searched every store I know and could not find it. W/ Amazon it took me 2sec. to locate and 2days to receive!!! I will definately use Amazon more often and am looking forward to more great stuff from Gary Allan!!
2,USED HEART FOR SALE,IF YOUR A GARY ALLAN FAN I UNDERSTAND WHY.GARY'S VOICE IS GREAT BUT THE SONGS HE SINGS USUALLY [ARE WEAK].OF ALL HIS ALBUMS THIS IS THE WORST....
3,Used Heart for Sale,"Compare to Gary Allan's other CD's this one was just okay it had a few good songs, but not just as many has his other CD's"
1,Awful!,This ink caused me so much frustration! It was constantly clogging up. I wasted more color ink on prints that I had to throw away because the black ink cartridge was not working!
3,Black or Color? Color!!!,"The black ink cartridge needed cleaning almost every 5-10 pages printed. Waste of ink! Although, the color cartridge works just perfectly."
1,eternally clogged,Since installing the Rhinotek cartridge I've used up half the ink by repeatedly cleaning the heads. A waste of time and money.
3,pill dispenser review,"It's a good way for one to organize a month's worth of medication if you're not taking alot of different pills .....as for me, I take 6/day. What I do not like is that you have to keep shutting the lids because they keep coming open by themselves - not good. I should have stayed with my old weekly containers."
3,It could of been a little better quality,"I think it's a great idea for a 30 day supply of meds. But the first time I went to fill the dispenser, one of the lids broke off. I tried gluing, taping it back on and nothing worked. Not cost effective to go through the return process, so I just bought another one and so far, so good."
2,30 DXAY PILL DISPENSER,"VERY POOR QUALITY. INDIVIDUAL COMPARTMENTS DIFFICULT TO OPEN BY ITSELF. WHEN OPENING A SINGLE COMPARTMENT, OTHERS OPEN AT SAME TIME. POOR MANUFACTURING QUALITY CONTROL."
2,Fine until it's not.,"These worked fine for a while. I got a pair (one for evening and one for morning) and labelled them. But after a few months, they stop staying shut.The top can be removed as one piece, which makes them easier to fill, I suppose, if the top went back on properly. It also means that a dropped pill box results in all the pills coming out.Yes, it's cheap, but you get what you pay for. I'm back on Amazon to buy a replacement that will hopefully work better."
2,Lids don't stay shut,"At first I was really pleased to discover that lids ""peel"" off in a strip making it much easier to feel. But now that I've filled it maybe three times the lids don't stay shut. I open a lid and turn it upside down to empty the pills into my had and three or more lids open and empty pills on to the floor! Maybe if the compartments were big enough to pull the pills out with a finger... But they are pretty narrow. Can be hard to fill. Probably going to stop using it... Don't recommend."
3,Get what you pay for.,Its a good monthly pill dispenser. When I took the plastic off the package 5 of the doors were already broken off. In addition to those two more popped of when I was filling it up. Very frustrating! Wish it was made a little better but you get what you pay for.
2,Poor Quality & Waste of Money,Compartment lids don't always stay closed and one lid snapped right off the first time I used it - Not pleased with the quality - especially when compare to other plastic pill organizers. Have had others for years and the lids have never broken off. Really need to be careful when using this or you will end up with pills everywhere when one of the compartments does not stay closed. Only used once and I now have a day with no lid!
2,Tabs snapped off on 2nd use. Compartments somewhat small. Followup.,"I have used this for two months and I have tabs falling off.If I turn it upside-down to shake out the pills for today the pills for the 27th fall out. Several others tabs are barely hanging on.A cell holds 2 fish oil capsules 2 niacin capsules and a 1/2 a multi vitamin barely..The idea is great, and I like that it has a spot for extra pills.I am surprised it has as good a rating as it has, perhaps people haven't tried it for more than a week.Followup:I am still using this despite my review I have taken clear packing tape and run it down the middle cutting slits all along the way for each box seems to work okay.Followup 2: February 2013Does not seem to be a good alternative on Amazon. The EzyDose and Countdown versions appear to be the exact same pill box. Need to replace my tape, still functional still ocationally dumps pills into sink. Need to be careful when using."
2,Lids Break Off After Use,"Lids will eventually break off after a few months. In our situation, we need a full-month dispenser. We can't find other full-month dispensers so we just purchase another - I wonder if that is a marketing ploy by the manufacturer? We shop other distributors for lowest, but they appear to be made by same company.Day numbers could be larger to aid those with failing eyesight. Brail would help. Would give 4 stars if the lids would not fail."
4,Does what it says.,"Smaller spaces than I thought. I was asking a lot for it to hold 2 fish oils, multivitamin and the rest of my pills. It holds them though, with no room to spare. 2 compartments open when opening one so be careful if you are going to dump into your hand.Can't beat it for the price though."
2,Too small!,The actual pill compartments in this organizer are very small and narrow. I bought this for my husband and he takes glucosomine chondroitin MSM and the pills wouldn't fit in the space provided for each day. This may work for prescription drugs but not for supplements.
5,Good once a day product,This product is very good for once a day pill dispensing. The individual compartments are not large so do not hold a large number of pills.
3,"Was OK, but one of the days was broken","One of the containers had a broken date on it. It was for my son and when he unpacked it, it was broken on the 3rd. we taped it, but was disappointed"
3,Pill dispenser ok< delivered in bad shape,The Container is great but the mfg needs to learn how to package their products. I bought two and they came in a TOO small box with no packing. One corner of the pill box was cracked and broken while some of the compartment lids were half ripped off. The thought of packing them up again and returning them pissed me off so I kept them but will not order fromm this company again.
5,Excellent!,"This is a wonderful pill dispenser. I like the size, and particularly like the fact that it will hold a full month of medication. It's the only pill dispenser I will ever use again."
5,Pill Dispenser,This product makes it easy for me to keep track of the pills my husband and I take on a daily basis.
5,Great Travel Dispenser,This is the pill dispenser for traveling (both when I fly and travel on the weekends) and it is a great little solid item. Good for the home and good for traveling. I really like this one.
1,Don't waste your money!,"I purchased one of these a year ago. I had the same problem as the other reviewers: first, one of the tabs snapped off one of the compartments. Then, the entire top failed and will not snap onto the bottom half of the box. Therefore, what I'm left with is a compartmentalized box, with no lids; since the lids won't stay on, the days of the month are gone, too."
2,It would have been great if it wouldn't have come broken.,"it was okay, but one of them came broken and it isn't worth the postage to send it back. I am making due with it."
