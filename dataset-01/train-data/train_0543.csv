4,cotton candy,This is a cute toy. It just takes awhile to get enough cotton candy for the child to eat. The children however love to do it.
1,why?,"Why are companies aloud to sell this junk? We tried this out a few moons ago, it was loud, ugly and gave you a tiny little sticky, stringy, gritty, burnt up, chewy thumb sized nasty tasting tuft of sugar product after 30minutes of use, it also smelled like burning plastic, it went back after that. give the nostalgia electric machine a try, unlike this one, it makes great tasting cotton candy, a proper cone within 3 minutes after the initial 5minute warm up."
1,"Brand new, did not work","Bought the machine brand new, like everyone else, followed the instructions to the letter, ten min warm up, actually bought and used professional sugar, the machine spits out a tiny bit of cotton candy, all mashed together maybe a base ball after 30 min. Has tons of melted liquid sugar all over. One of the worst products I have ever purchased."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"My daughter got this from a friend for her fourth birthday, and after three days of begging to make cotton candy we took it out of the box followed the instructions and it was broken. It would not turn on, would not beep as the instructions said it would in the case of assembly error. The disappointment in her face was terrible, this product is an utter piece of junk."
4,Love It!,"I heard negative things about this toy but since my children BEGGED for it Santa brought it anyway. Well, it is so much fun and I am on my third year. Every year Santa brings refill sugar. You must take good care of it and wash and dry it completely!!!!! Also, FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS to get the perfect cotton candy cone."
4,try this...,"Lost of people are giving this toy negative reviews. After a bit of experimentation, we tried making cotton candy using decorator sugar and this works great! There are no sticky, stringy, granules in the cotton candy. It is also fun because of the variety of colors! If the machine starts to smoke, you need to clean out the parts. We do this by soaking them in hot water! Don't be afraid to buy this toy, it's great!"
2,it is okay I guess!,"It was neat to be able to make ""cotton candy"" at home, however, the machine only makes a very small amount at a time, so it is a lot of work for not much enjoyment. It takes an adult to run the machine and watch over it since it gets hot. then it cools for almost 10 minutes. It doesn't even come with the sugar needed! The product should list it on the outside of the box..sugar not included! then you have to clean it (ADULT only)It would not buy it again.This review will not mark a 1 for educational value. It keeps giving it a 2 and I put a one (FYI)"
1,this toy sucks,"this toy was a rip off.when i put this toy together it gave off a burnt smell when it was warming up. this toy was loud and annoying the sugar flys everywhere and it was hot, melting sugar, it gave everbody i gave it to the poops for at least a week. if you buy this to have pepto-bismo handy beacause your going to need it for a couple of days."
4,COTTON CANDY REVIEW,"THIS TOY WAS VERY FUN. I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN USE REGULAR SUGAR. THE ONLY DOWNFALL SO FAR IS THAT WE CAN NOT FIND REFILLS, SUCH AS COLORED SUGARS UNLESS WE ORDER THEM ONLINE OR IN THE MAIL."
2,Cotton Candy,You have to pour the sugar in very very slowly. It was very time consuming and got thrown into the back of the closet never to be played with again.
5,this is the best! love it.,I got it for christmas and loved it. It makes a good amount of cotton candy and all my friends love it too. people who want more than it makes of candy are fat gluttons. I recommend it for everyone.
3,Good Idea - Poor Design,"If this thing worked, it would be great. It just doesn't make cotton candy like you expect it to. It's frustrating for the kids who are anticipating that big ball of cotton candy. Very disappointing."
2,Disappointing,"I have to agree with a lot of you out there...I was considering to buy either this book or the one written by Keel, ""All About Me"". After flipping through the pages of both books, being a young adult, I found the questions in ""The Milennium Memoir"" to be simpler to answer, and could easily relate to. As I look back, they seemed a little to simple, and each answer did not provoke much thought and meaning."
1,Do you know All About Me?,My Millennium Memoir is not an original idea. What I think? May the author and the publisher be ashamed far into the new millennium.
1,"Originality, anyone?","How about a little originality in the new millenium? This book is completely derivative of ""All About Me,"" a brilliant, insightful book that really gets you thinking about the big questions. Someone gave me Ms. Tate's book as a gift but I found it a poor -- actually, a shameful -- imitation of Philipp Keel's original. Sheesh."
4,looks good haven't used it yet,it is a Christmas gift so my son has not used it yet. hopefully it is a good one. bought two.
3,"Works Great, But Better Solutions","Seaclear ships their tanks with lights using the expand a light fixtures. Expanding your light couldn't be easier using this setup. Everything pops out and pops in. The only real work is undoing the wires so you can pass it through the seaclear assembly.The disadvantage? The max wattage of this fixture is 20 watts...which is generally not sufficient for the size of many tanks this fixture is used on. For planted tanks, you generally want a 2.0-2.5 watt per gallon. On my 46 gallon seaclear with this assembly, the max wattage I can get out of it is 40 watts...which really isn't great for any type of freshwater plants. Additionally, there is no reflectors at all with this setup, so much of the light is wasted.Thus if you're hoping to run a planted aquarium, it would be in your best interest to look into another solution which meets the actual needs of your tank."
3,Moen Monticello Robe Hook,"This robe hook is OK. When originally built my house, Moen made a very simple, practical robe hook that had one hook, very simple to install and did not protrude far from the door. When we were looking for additional hook to add to another door in the bathroom, this is the only option in Moen Monticello's line up that I could find.It is functional, but it is large and sticks out about 5-6"" from the door. I wish they had stuck with the KISS principle for the Monticello robe hook."
5,"Excellent work, excellent translator","""Abandon all hope, ye who enter here,"" is an apt phrase from this book. However, Ciardi's translation and footnotes make the social and theological context of the work spring to life and make it sensible to the modern reader. This diagrams, analogies, and history lessons are always interesting to read and give a deeper meaning to the text that would be missed entirely by the non-specialist. He seldom sacrifices rhyme, rhythm or meaning, and never all of them at once. Further, he insists on maintaining the parallelisms and structural cycles of the original, which makes for an excellent reading experience."
5,Great,"There's so many ways to take this book in your head. You might get depressed, angry, sickened, frustrated, and that's what makes it so great."
5,Just as Expected,"I purchased this book for a college course, and have found it to be actually enjoyable. It is a difficult read, however the summary and footnotes help immensely!"
5,Dante Revealed,"Without informed explanation from a scholar, Dante's mindset of 1300 is more than a little opaque to a reader of 2010. This edition, with an exciting translation by poet John Ciardi, includes a wealth of commentary explaining Dante's metaphysics, and the mental map that informs the Divine Comedy. Now the epic makes sense to me. BRAVO!"
1,price gouging,for those that are considering buying this copy here...don't. the exact same book is being sold through barns and nobles website for $17.98. why is this copy being sold with a $10 markup?
1,nonsense,"I last read Dante's ""Comedy"" in college. I thaught it might be rewarding to read it again, 40 years later. Now everybody finds out what a low-brow I am. ""The Comedy"" is a collection of nonsense from an age so seeped in religious nonsense that nothing was in excess in the name of God. Considered a ""Classic"" by generations of Christian zealots. I consider it (brace yourselves) trash."
4,review,Arrived in good time and in good shape. I haven't read it yet and neither has my wife who is actually the one who requested this book.
2,Not that happy,"The book was only part of the Divine comedy, really wanted more than Dante's Inferno....had to return it. Amazon was GREAT about the return!"
4,Great read,"Perhaps I'm one of the few people who didn't have to read this in high school / college. I'm not sure I would have liked to have been required to read it, but reading it now as an older adult I found it fascinating."
4,Thrillington,Not available in my Country. Exceptional service through Amazon and supplier. Laid back instrumental music of Paul McCartney's Ram. 4 stars. I'm a macca fan.
1,Not thrilled,This is a strange instrumental reworking of the songs from Ram. I bought it because in general I'm a Macca fan and wanted to 'complete' my collection.The reworkings are interesting only for curiosity's sake. The album I think was put together by him on a whimsical notion - hence it was never released under his name.Not worth getting unless you desire the whole set of Macca's works
2,Good and Bad,"I bought 2 joemos, I used my joemo everyday and loved it until it broke, then I used the other joemo that I had bought for my wife, the new one was junk and leaked from the very begining, nothing is worse then taking a drink and having it leak on you, the cause was the inside black seal kept falling off and not sealing. I truely liked that it kept my coffee very hot for a long period of time.Plus the fact that no warranty comes with the joemo."
1,Solid Mug,"UPDATE: This mug has great functionality, but it is way too hard to clean. After using it for a few months, I separated all of the pieces and discovered that my coffee/cream had solidified in all sorts of hard to reach places. So disgusting. It's a good mug, but be cautious about putting milk in it. I couldn't put the pieces back together correctly and had to throw it away.I am truly impressed with this mug, and I use it every day. You can pop the top closed to prevent spills, and pop it open to sip freely with 360 sip-ability. I left a full cup of coffee in my JoeMo, popped it closed, and drove across town. I came home two and a half hours later to perfectly hot coffee!!"
2,JOEmo color version is a bust.,"I picked up a couple of the JOEmo color mugs two weeks ago. Seemed like an interesting product at the time. I went for the color version because it seemed to have a little more pizazz. After 2 weeks and a few dish washings. ""top rack"" The color application has flaked off all over the top third of the mug. I'm left with a ugly streaky mess. Go with the plain silver mug if you get a JOEmo."
2,"awesome concept, faulty design","I loved this mug the first week I had it, I bought 3 more!Following the care instructions, with regular use, everyone of them now leaks for various reasons. The area you push to seal and unseal for drinking got unstable in most of them. Another one it just seems the rubber seals leak.A real bummer, because it is an awesome concept."
2,"Great Idea, Bad execution","They thought of a great idea. Extremely convenient push button top that you can drink from any side. Unfortunately, they use some of the cheapest plastic around to construct the lid which is easy to break. If they used stronger materials, I would easily recommend this product to all, but unfortunately, the cheap plastic sets it back. I dropped mine once, and that was the end. Shattered the lid into a billion pieces. On the other hand, I have dropped and banged my THERMOS mugs and they are still in working condition."
3,Highway Original Travel mug,"Highwave Original Ultimate Travel MugOwned one for year and a half. Used mostly for iced coffee. Was great til started doing cream too. Hard to clean inner parts of lid, gunk collects. Last cleaning and re-configuring lid parts has caused leaking and I don't have time to figure it out. Looking to purchase other non leak mug. Would appreaciate greater volume too. ln"
4,Highwave Travel Mug,"This mug absolutely comes through as promised. Hot beverages stay hot even hours later. It's totally leak proof and easy to disassemble for cleaning. I am very pleased with this purchase! The only thing that I am not completely satisfied with is it's size. I would have preferred something a little wider, but the ability to fit in any drink holder is what the manufacturer was going for.....unfortunately it tends to move around in mine, but it doesn't spill any thing!"
2,Cool design but no coffee!,"This product says it is 14 oz. It barely holds 10 oz. I don't need to keep 10 oz. of anything hot for ten hours when I would drink it in one minute! I wanted a good cup to take to a coffee shop to reduce waste. This one doesn't even hold the smallest amount of coffee they offer as well the design is such that if you fill the cup past this ridge, when you put the lid on it over flows the sides of the container all over the place. The design is pretty good. I like the idea of being able to drink from all sides of the cup when in use and then to have a lid that makes it totatly tip proof for a bag. I wish it came in a bigger size and I wish the description was accurate and said it only holds 10 oz."
3,"Great for on the go, but...","I like this mug because it doesn't have a handle or a single spot you have to drink from. I can just throw it in my purse before I leave in the morning. It's not as easy to clean as I thought it was going to be after reading some reviews from this mug and some of it's competitors. The top comes completely apart, but there are little crevices that are difficult to get to."
4,It's Not That Big,"I read a lot of reviews where people commented on the size of the ringer. It's actually a lot smaller than I thought it would be & it does a great job of keeping he bumps and knocks away from the microphone, so it does it's job. I'd recommended it."
3,Good but not great,"I decided to get the ringer at the same time as my 8-ball to save some money on shipping. I have a failry cheap microphone that I've used for a year to do some home recording. The old mic gives me a constant B-fllat and it's a little annoying, so I bought the ringer thinking the blue mic would have the same problem if it was recording while sitting on my desk. NOT SO. The 8-ball is a superb microphone for the budding rock-start/podcaster (maybe overkill, but is there really such a thing). In short, the 8-ball does a fantastic job recording a clear, white noise free track while sitting on my desk. Also I don't have a stand to attach the ringer to, so right now the ringer is sitting pretty in it's packaging.I would love for Blue to sell the tripod by itsell rather than only sell it in combo with the snowball. If you already have a mic stand AND are using more high end software that could record the miniscule background noise I'd recommend the Blue Ringer."
2,Needs more work,"The shock part of this is fine, but the mount part needs a lot of work.Problem 1) Once locked in, the mount part of it wobbles back and forth. It's loose and no amount of tightening will fix it, looks like they tried already and stripped out the screws at the plant. Now Blue was very accommodating and sent me a new one which is better but it still will wobbles about a 1cm back and forth at the top. I ended up using some super glue to stop this. At home this is ok, but in a studio or regular recording use it probably won't stand up for long.Problem 2) The swivel arm, you just cant get it tight enough. The screw is made of very soft metal and the swivel is flat metal on flat metal so it never really gets right enough and a good push will knock it over. Once it's on a mic swivel arm I don't think it will last long. It might but I'm not sure.Pro * It does the isolation part well and if I can keep it immobile it will do a fine job, just needs an update (version #2 ? )"
2,Unstable,"The outer ring is very loose and unstable where it joins the stand mounting bracket. This allows the outer ring to rock back and forth, which IMO negates the benefit of the shock mount. Everything else looks find. The vendor has agreed to send me a refund after I send it back. He thinks that they're all like this. This seems like a real oversight on the part of the manufacturer."
3,Loose joints,"The purpose of shockmount is to prevent possible noise created from vibrations. However, the loose joint itself create the most rattling noise. Totally defeat the purpose. However, if you manually tighten the screws enough, it still works."
4,"So far, so good.","Love the shock mount. I can stomp and stamp as much as I feel like it and the vibes are minimized or completely inaudible. Also, it's incredibly well-made."
2,Easily Broken,"I had a similar experience as another reviewer. The thumb-screw is for crap. Because the whole assembly is so heavy, you need to put a lot of pressure on that screw if your mic isn't in a straight-up-and-down position. I used the Blue as one of the mics I for recording a guitar, so I bend it over and twist it around a lot. It was very difficult to get it tight enough by hand, and eventually that little leaf just twisted away. The whole assembly is ruined because of that little piece of garbage metal. Unlike the other reviewer, I can't just replace the screw (because of where mine broke). So my only option is to get a new one. Which I will because the mic is great. But I won't be giving Blue more business, I think."
4,"First one broken, second one much better.","Great shock mount for a non standard shaped microphone (the blue) - although it should work decently with other microphones.When my first one arrived, the 'key' which tightens the circular mount was broken in the box. I sent it back and it was replace with a second. The new one seems to be redesigned - but I'm being careful with it.The shock mount really as taken the vibration out of my recordings. If you own a blue microphone, this is a must own."
4,Great for my Snowball mic,"Like reviewer C.J. Bockay, I wasn't sure if I needed a $40 shock mount. I went ahead and bought one and I'm glad I did. The mount is fine for isolating the microphone. I haven't had any problems keeping it steady as another reviewer reported. Mine doesn't wobble at all even when I pick up the entire mic stand. Aside from isolating the mic, the most obvious benefit is providing a few more inches of height to the microphone. The Snowball mic stand is not particularly tall but this mount brings the entire mic to my mouth level so I don't have to look down to speak. While I usually don't focus too much on a product's appearance, this thing is pretty impressive looking and it gets attention when people come into my home office. The shock mount is big, if you're taking videos of yourself while recording or podcasting, make sure to position the camera so that the shockmount doesn't appear in front of you. It will block your face."
5,Product Updated for free == Can now be 5 stars !,"In reading the reviews about the flimsy mount and thumbscrew, I decided to call Blue. I explained the problem as described in these reviews. Within 5 seconds of me finishing a description of the problem, the Blue customer service rep said the product has been recently updated and she would exchange it for me free of charge, no questions asked. They are doing this for anyone who has the old style Ringer so give them a call if you're frustrated. Customer service was excellent and as you probably know, their microphones are already the best you can get for the price point (unless you want to spend $2500 on a mic). I just called them this morning so I haven't received the updated Ringer yet...so I can only hope the problem is resolved; however, they said that was main reason for the redesign and said the new design is much better and eliminates all known issues with previous design. Go Blue!"
4,"It is nice, but big.","It is nice, but big. Bigger than you think! It looks huge next to my laptop. It functions flawlessly and the sound quality is amazing. You can tap the desk next to it and the mic does not pick it up. It is also fairly heavy, made out of solid metal. You could stick it in your purse and use it for self-defense if needed."
5,soulful and enduring,"Liked this music the first time I heard it. The songs stay with you, even into your dreams. The vocals are mellow, and the exotic instrumentals are deep. An excellent choice for any time of day."
3,St George for England A Tale of Cressy and Poitiers,"This genuine relic of 19th century imperial English propaganda masquerading as a history is suitable really for young boys under the age of 16 years. It is simplistic, rustic, with a quaint touch of romance that was probably quite becoming over a 100 years ago: but it is regrettably brief on and much real historically useful detail and long on whimsical storytelling. But a good tale for people without any real knowledge of these two very famous, if one sided, medieval battles where killing technology was very important and which kept the English embroiled in French politics and history for another couple of centuries."
3,Horrible Clasp! Beautiful Bracelet,"I picked this out as a gift and I loved it! I got multiple compliments on it but my biggest concern was the clasp. It easily would break open and the bracelet would just fall off (changing clothes, sleeping). Maybe I was too rough with it but it's great for the price. If they found a more reliable way to close it it'd be a five stars."
4,"Nice product, good for the shower.","I am on my 3rd bottle of this product and I think it works very well. Not a really harsh exfoliant, but the skin feels softer after using it on a regular basis. It is not very scented which is something I appreciate. I use soap first and then this product afterwards, as I am not sure how good of a job it does at cleansing."
3,Less than impressed,This body wash seems like it is the exact same formula as the dove exfoliating bar soap. It lathers fine and smells ok if you like a plain and simple soap scent. I have used many different exfoliating soaps before and this one is one of the worst. It has these little beads that seem to be made of plastic and do not dissolve. I don't feel like it exfoliates very well at all. Not to mention this body wash is rather expensive.
1,Horrible,"This is probably one of the worst CD's ever created. Especially considering he is very decent on stage, this tabla performace is plainly crude, un-innovative and devoid of greatness."
5,One Year Annivsary Gift,"I haven't given this to my boyfriend, as I had already bought him a Christmas gift when I found out he always wanted THIS watch--When I saw it on Amaizon for half the price I got it and am holding on to it for our ONE YEAR or ENGAGEMENT...which ever comes first!IT'S PERFECT!"
4,Always read the early ones.,"I came across this book after reading a score of books on the JFK murder. The author was a multi-lingual, European freelance writer who had authored political biographies and a wide range of books. This book - published in mid 1964 - before the WC report- does much of what should have been done by American journalists. He smelled something wrong, studied the reports and was quite clear on the essentials that would be be touched on by the Garrison investigation, expanded by the 1978 House Hearings and virtually confirmed by the release of ARRB papers in the early 90's. Oswald was a government agent and there were things done in Dallas that assisted the killing. Things that Lane and Meagher and Weisberg would write about a few years later. A great way to have an immediate feel for what always smelled fishy."
5,Worthwhile Reading,"Mr. Joesten pretty well figured out what had happened in Dallas from the beginning. No wonder Johnson, Hoover, et al. had to make sure that this book was not published in the U.S."
4,A great CD!,"This record took a lot of hits when it was first released. The most common criticism was that the music was simple. Well, what's wrong with that? Rock and roll is not complicated. I have seen this band in concert twice, once before they got big and once after. They were a great live band, and their live CD is one of the best live CDs ever made. On Time is a debut any rock and roll group could be proud of, and Grand Funk Railroad was one of the best groups from the late 1960's/early 1970's. They played simple, straight-ahead rock and roll, and I can't think of anything much better than that."
5,I'm happy with the sword.,"This sword is exactly what I needed. It looks great, its just the right length, and it arrived quickly.I often dress in garb when I go to the Local Renaissance Faires and I needed a sword that matched my outfit. This sword fit my outfit perfectly.I am very happy with my purchase."
2,tow mirror,"cheap, cheesy, dont really stay on well and the mirror on the extension should be convex, not flat! What were they thinking? i could not recommend this product to anyone. I sent them rite back,put on two spot mirrors and the problem was solved. However...the paint on my stock mirrors will be forever scrached having tried this product."
4,Looks and works great,Looked at alot of options. This one is very easy to take on and off and it looks good.
4,Sony at its best,"I was searching for a super wide Sony make high speed lens, I was a bit hesitating to purchase fisheye because I knew it distorts and 11~18 is not that fast. I tried 16MM as I had no options and what a pleasant surprise - I am happy to say that with 16 MM I have been handling distortion to my advantage..It is very effective glass, unbelievable sharp and captures great rendition, very cute size to enjoy, it is now always on my camera, don't feel like changing to earlier (sigma20-40) wide angles.Filters are integral part of this lens but not much of an attraction in today's world. Wish instead Sony had thought of protecting the outer surface, as it can scratch too easily.Amazon.com was offering best value, quick in supply; actually nothing to say beyond that I have been buying my stuff since many years from them. May be they needed to increase range in accessories, beyond standard items."
4,BBB-Bad to the bone,George Thorogood has been playing blues rock for already34 years now. This is a good Concert CD.Get yours today.
1,soft core,"why oh why does he have to have that annoying sax playing. There are times when you cannot even hear the guitar. Considering he worked for houndog taylor he should take a lesson out of the masters book, forget the sax and the keyboards and just start rockin' no more of this soft crap"
5,Gtd,One of geroge thorogoods best live CD good setlist sounds really great.from start to end if your A G.T. fan I WOULD GET this one.
3,excellent reference on women's historical costuming,"Excellent reference for illustrators and animators. However, ""Costume in Detail"" only covers women's costuming, which is unfortunate considering the attention the author paid to the material."
1,these do not fit our labyrinth,these balls are too big for our labyrinth. still on the search for the right size. i wish they made it easier by giving the whole size these work for.
1,much to large,The cable is much to lrge for my use. I would have preferred something smaler and shorter.
3,The Big Book of Boat Canvas: A Complete Guide to Fabric Work on Boats,Not bad for a beginner - I was looking for something with more precise info - I know how to make duffle and tote bags and I know how to pick out fabric. I wanted clear and concise info on how to cover boat seat cushions and some of their strange angles.
3,Too basic,"Good beginners book, but the projects are not detailed. I was hoping for something more advanced. Example: instructions for building a dodger take up about one page."
2,Old fashon,"Gammelmodig bok, finn en nyere hvis du er interessert i btsm. Drlige gamle tegninger. Trengte en bok for lage cockpittelt og boken var ikke til srlig hjelp- old fashon"
4,Great Beginners guide...,"This is a great guide for the beginning canvas worker, has a lot of great general information as well as step-by-step directions for a number of projects for both exterior and interior use on boats. Highly reccomended!"
3,"Long, but interesting.","This book is long, perhaps unnecessarily so, and at times I was skeptical of the organizational strategy. That said, Conner makes some important points. Considering the heavy impact of science on social policy, it is critical that science be accessible to the masses and that the general public have a say in the direction and priorities of scientific research."
1,"Whatever you do, don't buy this DVD.","I was hoping that this DVD would in some way shed light on the topic of directing. Not a chance. This is nothing more than an interview with someone I have never heard of talking about movies I've never seen (or would want to) with two hosts that are stuck in the 80's (and not the good part of the 80's, if there was one). Or was this shot in the 80's? Imagine John Waters, Roger Corman, and Hugh Heffner all rolled into one, but with out any hint of ability or talent.Simply put, who cares. Save your cash and watch a classic movie."
1,A quick observation.,"As I meandered through Amazon, I found this DVD on directing.But as there's no real product review from the publisher, or from anyone else, I was left to enlarge the picture of the DVD to glean some sort of information...They've spelt 'FILM' wrong on the jacket. A DVD that was rushed out to market about 'flim' making can only be so instructive.Another point the publisher might want to clarify: Is this about producing a film or the craft of directing? The information on the jacket seems to be indicating that the director will be talking mostly about producing. In that case, I'd rather hear from a producer.First draft's always a doosie."
1,It doesn't even rate one star,"I purchased a download of this product. It was horrible. Poor quality. Of no instructional value whatsover. One of the worse purchases I've ever made, period."
1,"""Zero"" Star Rating","[[Directing Movies, Vol. 1: From Action to Wrap]]I am a huge idiot for having bought this without checking the reviews first. You would be a much bigger idiot if you repeat my mistake. Take your money you would have spent on this and flush it down the toilet, while doing so film it on your cell phone camera, burn it to a DVD, and your finished product will be more interesting and worthwhile than this tripe. What a colossal waste. No redeeming value of any kind, except to say that clearly ANYONE can make a movie."
1,Buyer BEWARE!,Nails too overpriced. Check local store prices before purchasing. Loved Nail gun not nail prices.
1,Not a value,Check at your local building supply retailer....you can get the same or better quality nail with substantial savings.
4,Exactly as ordered,"I could not find these nails at any of the big box home improvement stores.But Amazon had them. They are exactly what I needed. They were a good price, and arrived promptly. What more can you ask for?"
3,Expensive,"I gave these nails three stars because of the current pricing. Home Depot and Lowes both sell boxes of these nails at 4000 per box. The current pricing as of August 2010 is $38.98 for an entire 4000 box. The current Amazon price is $14.53 for 500, so 4000 nails is $116.24. Nearly triple the cost."
3,price,Ok you can't compair to lowes their high to begin with. But It does seem high priced for 500 nails. hope these are the right nails for my gun.C/h ironforce. also the free shipping is very slow. like a snail witha broken leg.By the time they get here I can use them to nail down my ice shanty on the lake.
4,"Good kit, but I do not like the new packaging","We have ordered these before... packaged arrived in timely manner and was exactly what we expected - except for new packaging. We re-ship these to patiens sometimes, so the new cylinder package is not as easy to re-ship as the previous flat packaging. Otherwise, price is fine and shipping was quick. Well done... and we will likely ordered again when the need for more arise."
2,Decent,"Decent review of allergies, but not necessarily a good thing to send you blood to some random place to get tested."
1,can't get blood from a stone,"I haven't been able to submit this test yet, because I can't get enough blood to fill the vile. I've tried both lancets, but I'm actually waiting until I cut myself to try to collect blood. Unless you bleed easily I wouldn't recommend this kit."
2,Skeptical about this test,"The lancets for this product are extremely dull and short, and you can't re-stick. If you're a ""hard stick,"" count on having to spend about 20 dollars more for lancets and a sticking device (I got mine from Walgreens). Also, I thought it was difficult to actually close the test tube, and I'm not sure that the blood didn't leak out on the way to the testing facility.My results were obtained so quickly after mailing that I wondered whether or not the sample had actually been tested, especially since my results were all negative and I'm fairly certain that I'm allergic to at least one of the substances tested.I am very dubious about this product."
1,Inaccurate.,I know that I am allergic to cats. This test said I am not. Don't waste your time or money.
3,Book review,The book is decent lite reading. The author makes an attempt at a well written book but falls short. If Charles Kettering were any less interesting then the book would be a failure.
5,Just right,Yes it is limp when you are setting it up but it is short enough that it doesn't take that long to position properly. I used this with the holes facing downwards and after several hours I found that it had thoroughly wet an area about 15 to 20 inches on either side of it.
1,TOTAL *** WASTE OF MONEY ***,Trying to use this is like trying to lay down a wet noodle on the lawn. The hose is very thin and flimsy and becomes twisted very easily. Both sides look the same and there is no white line on the top side. The only way to find the top side is to turn the water on at a low volume. Then you get wet trying to lay it down correctly. I bought two of these and I wasted my money. DO NOT buy this hose unless you like throwing your money away.
5,BEAUTIFUL,I bought this for my friend's son's welcoming party and it was absolutely beautiful. I would definately recommend purchasing this.
5,perfect A++++ dad loves them!!,"i purchased these shoes for my 67 year old dad who because of diabetes and circulation problems has very, very wide feet. i needed a 5E. these shoes fit perfect! he was beyond thrilled and they are very well made and comparing prices from other sites, the price you just can't beat anywhere. i would highly recommend these shoes to anyone looking for well fitting comfortable shoes!"
5,peopet mens life walker - Amazon,"This not my first pair. The first pair I bought several years ago locally, but since then I couldn't find the locally. I had to go to the internet. It is a great shoe and i will continue to use them. Amazon had the best price."
2,Ho Chi Minh El Cheapo Shoe,"Top material is akin to cardboard. Upper toes wore out first week. I have to keep gluing the toes to keep dirt and water from entering. So far, used 2 tubes of GOOP so as to keep them useable. Sorry excuse for a shoe; SHAME!!..Popet"
2,Not good quality,"I purchased a pair of these shoes 4 months ago at Academy Sporting Goods. I was pleased at first, but my satisfaction quickly turned to disappointment. 2 weeks after I bought them, the soles started coming off. The tread wore out quickly and there are already holes worn in the soles. I have only had these shoes 4 months and they are already due for replacement. Not good quality and I will not be buying more. I do not recommend this shoe."
4,Good Pair of Shoes,I really like this pair of shoes they are wide enough for my feet and easy to get on. I am diabetic and need a comfortable shoe to walk in. I wear them all the time so i am going to have to buy another pair or they will wear out prematurly. The reason for only 4 stars is they need to be made of real leather.
5,Diabetic Shoe,This shoe is very comfortable and durable. I have bought 2 pairs for my brother who has diabetes and they have lasted a long time. He says they are very comfortable and I have seen his gait improve with these shoes. A very good deal if you've ever priced diabetic shoes.
4,First internet shoe purchase.,"My 80 year old uncle needed needed new walking shoes after having his knee replaced. Distance and size constraints made it worthwhile taking a chance on buying shoes off the web and having a next day Saturday delivery via Amazon Prime a very viable option. If it didn't work out I had an extra day to run from store to store looking for the right type, size, and price. He got the shoes the next day, wore them for several days before therapy, and continues to wear them comfortably. He liked the color and the velcro flaps especially. HAven't seen them in person yet, but he seems thrilled with them."
5,Live up to their promise,"I wore a pair of these every day for a year. The sole came loose about 1/4 inch at the heel, so I bought another pair.I returned the year old shoes to the factory and was surprised to get a refund.I have no problem recommending this company."
4,"Propet Men's Life Walker Strap Sneaker,Black","This was a Christmas gift. My husband has not used these shoes yet, but I have the womens shoes and love them. They are stylish for men and I would definitly order these shoes again."
4,Good Product,Very comfortable with good traction. I recommend this to anyone wanting this type of shoe. I will buy them again.
5,Proet men's Life Walker Sneaker,Very comfofrtable shoes . A wonderful fit. I highly recommend these shoes.they are very well made and should last a long time.
5,Great shoes and Service,"I recently got some orthodics to help with the foot damage caused by spending a half hour most days on the treadmill for many years. The issue was, that I like to have a number of shoes for different purposes. With orthodics you need wider shoes to accommodate them, so all of my current medium shoes were no longer usable for me. I had purchased three pair of shoes at the specialty shoe store at $140 a pair but need a few more. The Propet's were sold at the store for about twice what I paid for them at Amazon. The shoes are comfortable, excellent for orthodics and delivery time was great too."
4,good shoe...,"Good shoe and the velcro straps are long and truly work. Very comfortable fit. The only glich, they're a bit hefty, but would buy them again.Jim...Clearfield, PA"
1,Description doesn't match picture,"Although the description is ""strap"" oxford, the picture shows tie shoe. Due to disability, I needed velcro and ordered the strap shoe but received a tie shoe. The shoe had to be returned."
2,"nice product, oversized","Very nice product, but its not true to size. So be careful when buying it. Because trying to make a return shoes back to Amazon's customer service is comparable to beating your head against a brick wall...."
1,"Many tracks end prematurely, mislabeled tracks, otherwise a wonderful performance",MP3 album: Its a pity that this record was ruined by the mislabelling and prematurely ending of many of the tracks!Appears to be a great performance/recording otherwise. I'm trying to get a refund for it and order the CD version instead:http://www.amazon.com/Bach-Matthew-Passion-Johann-Sebastian/dp/B0000365NE/I rather pay 15$ more and get something to properly encode it myself...
4,Issue with MP3 download,Beware that almost all tracks skip to the next song about 2 seconds prior to the end of music which can be very annoying...otherwise the music is great.
5,The Conclusion of a Great Arc,"The Third Season of Bleach starts with Ichigo having 3 days to train in order to reach the limits of his power. The story for him, Rukia, Uryu, Renji, and the rest of the crew heats up as a rebellion occurs within Soul Society. This Season has some of the most memorable fights and moments of the series, along with the much awaited fight between Ichigo and Byakuya Kuchiki.This product is well worth the price, and the Limited Edition Collector's Edition is a must have for die-hard fans.The dub is one of the best for any anime, but the original Japanese version is still available for you to enjoy."
3,Missing subtitles,I watched the entire set and there are many scenes on all the disks where the characters are speaking but no subtitles. I don't speak Japanese but it was quite obvious something was missing. I even saw one scene where the subtitles flashed very briefly and disappeared. I don't understand how a multi million dollar company can do a worse job than some of the people out there doing the illegal fan subs.
3,Some rare tracks,"Note that this is not the famous version of ""Marianne"". That version was actually done by The Easy Riders (All day, all night, Marianne) and is available on CD."
3,Great tape for yoga and meditation,"We use this tape in my yoga class during the beginning centering meditation and Chen Rezi is just the most beautiful and awesomely calming piece of music I have heard. As a matter of fact I intend to use this when I am in labor, as I am expecting my third child this December. Namaste!"
4,TAKE A LOAD OFF,Isn't it nice to relax? This recording will fill your house and take you to the enchanted land of healing within minutes of flinging those constraining shoes at the wall. Perfect for after work!
3,not her best,"I love Gabrielle Roth, and have worn out copies of ""initiation"" and ""bones"", but this CD just gathers dust for me insteading of making me want to dance."
1,Retro junk - Zero Stars,"This book was laughed off the shelf when it was originaly released in the early 70s and has only been again made available because the publisher (Llewellyn) is trying to win back more traditional Wiccans. The problem is, not only has the Wiccan movement moved well beyond this sort of material, it was never interested in the lies and false representation presented here. The author is yet another poser who makes the rediculous claim that Wicca is an ancient religion passed down for hundreds of years. A prime example is the inclusion of the Charge of the Goddess. Although Doreen Valiente clearly says she rewrote it into the form that is presented in this book, the author seems to think that the charge was written hundreds of years earlier. Avoid this book as it has nothing to do with either modern Witchcraft or even the movement when it was written."
2,Not For Beginners,"""The Grimoire of Lady Sheba"" wasn't the first book I've read about Wicca, and I'm very happy that it wasn't.The book doesn't really explain about the Craft and it's holidays etc. but just gives rituals and spells.There are a lot of print errors in it.The first thing I've noticed when I just went over the book briefly was that the dates of the Sabbats were incorrect, when I read the book thoroughly I so that many of Lady Sheba's spells were spells to control and manipulate people, which is wrong according to Wicca.I think that people who are completely new to Wicca shouldn't read this book first, if they want to they should read it after reading some good books so they'll see the difference and know the true meaning...Also there are a few nice ideas in the book that can be ""borrowed"" to rituals and spells in the correct manner."
2,A very important CD and one of Biddulph's Best!,"Biddulph transfers are usually pretty good but this is just magic. For anyone interested in the artistry of Cortot this disc is really a must.This is the biggest single ""find"" in all of the Cortot discs I've listened to!I intended to rate this five stars but made an error in the selector that I can't seem to undo....Strong Five Star Rating!"
4,Death be Not Proud,"If you're looking for a really good book to read, read ""Death Be Not Proud"". It is a very dramatic,Horrifying, and a very interesting book. Somethings in the book are very interesting and this book teaches you that one person who is a good student in class he takes 6 courses instead of 5 like everyone else. He jelps other people with their homework so that the other kids can get help with their homework. Then he finds out that he might have cancer and his parents are horrified for him and so is he he doesn't know what to do and is really really scared.Tiffany Rogers"
3,"I feel guilty saying this, but...","After reading this book, I wanted to know Johnny. Instead, the father spent a lot of time on talking about how wonderful and lovely Johnny was - how everyone loved him, how he was a genius, and talented, and this and that. Johnny could do no wrong. Of course, I understand the therapeutic nature of the book, but it was only when the father allowed the veil of his grief to drop and we saw Johnny scared, or sad, or angry that we felt he was human. Then the book really made you feel something. Otherwise, it was even a little...yes, I'm an awful person for saying this, but... boring. At the end, I was left wanting to know more about what Johnny was really like, rather than the godlike child the father had conjured to obscure the scared boy with cancer hiding underneath.This was an OK book - I read it and didn't feel an urge to stop reading while doing so, but I don't think I would recommend it to others or read it again."
4,Review,John Gunther writes about everything his son endured fighting the brain tumor. Johnny returns home from school and finds out he has a brain tumor. Johnny dies in 1947 at the age of seventeen.I liked the characters because they were smart and didn't let the doctor's force them into something they didn't want to do. The main idea of the book is that you can fight through the tough time in our lives. The main conflict is that Johnny has the brain tumor and he has surgery to get rid of it but they couldn't get it all. So they try the mustard gas to kill it and other ideas.I didn't like the book because it was sad to read about someone struggling to beat a brain tumor and dieing. Also because it tells you what is going to happen right at the beginning.
3,An Emotional Memoir That Keeps Its Focus,"Death Be Not Proud was a fairly easy read for me, but for someone who has experienced the illness or death of a child, it might not be. Gunther managed to create the perfect balance of fact and memoir, rendering this a believable, but not maudlin, journey through the experience of his young son's battle and loss to brain cancer. Even though this particular battle was lost, what I took away from the book was how brilliant our health care system is, and how our medical knowledge is constantly inventing itself, and has been, as evidenced even during the far-away 1940s of the book. I recommend reading Death Be Not Proud including that perspective: how fast, and with how many treatment modalities were the Gunthers able to try to save Johnny? Today as our health care options are under attack, I recommend this book to anyone who favors competition, innovation and humanity."
3,Sort of slow...,"I agree that it was beautifully written, and I feel the pain of Johnny's parents, but I felt the book was sort of slow moving. However, I do suggest you read it because it does change youre outlook on life"
3,Not great.....,"Death Be Not Proud by John Gunther Senior is the story of his son's struggle with a brain tumor. It is actually quite interesting and the writing is good. I rate this book low because it is hard to spympathize with Johnny. His father, the author, is terribly biased and makes Johnny sound like a god among grasshoppers. It almost makes me, being a 15 year old, feel inferior. We never really see the Johnny actually being a kid. Sure we read that he plays games and has friends, but these details are minimal and minor. All we ever read ia about Johnny's Intelligence and Bravery, but never the fear he had over the tumor or how hard it was for him."
4,You won't be able to stop turning the pages in suspense.,"Death Be Not Proud, A Memoir is the sad story of a young man's stryggle to get through a brain tumor. Johnny will have to put his hopes and dreams of becoming a famous chemist on hold when a tumor in his brain is found. No matter how many doctors Johnny sees and how many days Johnny must spend ib the hospital, he never gives up. Anyone who appreciates a good book, and doesn't mind a depressing book will love Death Be Not Proud, A Memoir."
4,Good but....,"I find Mr. Gunther's story of his son's death very moving, but have always thought it just plain wrong that he basically lied to his son. Johnny never knew he was going to die. What might he have wished to do or say that he was never given the chance? As Mr. Gunther points out, Johnny was a fine young MAN. He of all people had the most right to know what was happening to him. He handled death with dignity because he never knew it was coming. I can't help but feel that this may have taken something else away from Johnny in his last days."
3,A moving tribute to a remarkable young man,"This father's memoir about the death of a his son is a sad story of a dying boy, his family and his world. One will appreciate how the author doesn't drown the reader in a pool of self-serving lamentations or manipulative gestures of grief. Rather, we find out about a remarkable boy who was so full of life and courage, taken before his time."
5,good book,"I tried reading this in 6th grade. I remember i had read the preface, put it down, and stayed away. Now, 4 years later, without a good book to read, I randomly picked this book and i am now in awe.The second time around, i skipped the preface, and just read the novel Death Be Not proud. I was immediately drawn. I finished the book in two sitting.I knew Johnny was going to die. I knew, but in the end, I was still teary after reading the book.I was surprised that the book was written in 1949. The author, John Gunther died in 1970. The themes and stories are still reflected today.Seriously, i look at the Schiavo case, which has been on the news for the past week. And how Terri Schiavo's brain dead and in the hospital for 15 years, trying to undergo some sort of treatment, but having nothing work out."
1,no good book,"I was told i'd have to read this book at the end of my aim literature class, i picked up the book and read it. Reading this book was definitly some form of chinese torture. The book is overall no good and would put you to sleep in a second. The father who writes this book makes his son sound all high and mighty, like some athletic, nerdy, superkid. You cannot relate to the character Johnny, who loves school and this whole book drags like a saggy butt, you could skip a thousand pages and it would not matter overall this book stinks. This book is as good as licking your cats toe fungus off of a moldy peice of cheese."
1,I read it in school...,and I really didn't enjoy it at all. The writing was very good but I can't understand why we had to read it. It just did not touch me at all.
4,It was a heartbreaing story,"The first chapters of ""Death Be Not Proud"",was very emotional from the beginning. To see an intellignent young man detorirate because of a brain tumor was very sad. I would recommend this book to families,friends who are going through a hard time because of brain tumors. You have to be brave and calm. This book wil help you understand the stuggle of a family to overcome a death situation. If you want to know the rest go buy the book!"
4,Death be not Proud,Hope v.s. Brain TumorThe book Death be not Proud is a story about a 16 year old that was diagnosed with a brain tumor. The story is written from his father's point of view. Johnny was a high- spirited young man that wanted to live life to the fullest. His mother was always there to help him enjoy he fifth teen months in the hospital. Johnny got out of the hospital and said hello and good- bye all his friends in high school before graduating. He was fine for a couple months taking meds and having help. Things got bad when Johnny couldn't remember how to tie his shoes or button up his shirts. Johnny started to feel a lot of pain in his head so they re-admitted him to the closest hospital and he passed away a few days after. All of his life he dreamed of going to Harvard University and if there was anyone that could have taken this away it would have made a difference in his friends and family's life. If you are looking for a touching story read Death be not Proud.
4,Inspirational,"This is a really well written book. It is really sad, but insipring how this family is always on the son's side during all the treatments for the son's brain tumor."
5,I was so much older then,"I first read Death be not Proud, for school, years ago, not long after publication. I knew everything for sure then. It was an OK read.Now, after both familial and personal fights with cancer, it seems more profound. More personal."
4,Still as good as ever,Read back in high school and now as my wife is an English teacher recently re-read it. Still as good as I remember.
3,Death be not proud review,"This story is about Jonnys brain tumor. About the struggle for his life he went through to try to stay alive. Jonny lived for 15 months. He died on June 30, 1947. I liked the character Jonny because he was so determined to keep up with his school work. No matter how sick he felt, he never stops. I also liked John, Jonnys dad. John was by Jonnys side the whole time he was sick, never gave up on his son. The main idea of the book is to enjoy your life as long as you can. Life is too short to not enjoy, because tomorrow you could be dead. I think the main conflict is about Jonny fighting against his brain tumor for 15 months. I thought the book was all right. This book did not have the material I like to read. It was a good book for the books I don't like to read.By: Kaitlynn Audette"
3,Death Be Not Proud,"This was a good book for the most part. I have read better ones, but this isn't horrible. It seemed that the father practically worshiped Johnny, his son with the brain tumor. Throughout the book, all I read was praise, praise, praise for this ""perfect"" teenager boy. He was ""genius"" ""incredibly nice"" and just plain ""perfect"" according to this father. It got boring after a while reading all about flawless Johnny's achievments. I guess touchy emotional books aren't for me."
3,Less than I bargained for,"I expected it to be much more moving. The book was written well, and captured the struggle Johnny had with the cancer. But based on the reviews I read online and on the book, I expcected to be close to tears, but I wasn't The story is good, the idea is good, but its not all I thought it would be. Not to say dont read it, but if you want to be moved, i'm not sure this is the right book."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I kept looking for a point, for a deeper meaning, but I reached the end without ever having it. Though beautifully written, it is nonetheless quite depressing. It is the chronicle of the death of a somewhat talented boy, and very little more. What's more, the poor boy dies without ever knowing for sure he's going to die, and for all the brilliance and education he's surrounded with and that he himself displays, he nonetheless dies without making any peace with life or the afterlife. He had all the education in the world at his fingertips but died with an uneducated soul. Any month's version of Reader's Digest will most likely carry a more meaningful version of someone's struggle with a life-threatening illness. I really wanted to be touched by this book but in the end found it sadly pointless."
2,Death be not proud,This book was about a boy who had tumor in his brain and then he faught it off when he went in and he had sergery. Then the tumor came back and he died. His family was really sad and they greived over his loss. I did not like this book it went way to slow and they repeated the selves about three times of every part. They also dragged all of the parts out. I would recomend this book to anyone over 20. Or just somone who likes reading doesnt mind what kind of book it is.
2,Death Be Not Proud,"I thought this book was good, but it was really confusing...i mean the dad is like ""well i wont use all the confusing science termanlogy"" and then he goes off into this huge speel of all these words i have no clue waht they mean! So..um..that is my opinion..so i'd like to see what some other ppl thought..thank you."
1,"Miserable, boring book","I picked this book up with the hope of finding a strong, moving story of a child fighting death. And, for a while, it was pretty good. But the problem is it's basic plot: child fights death. For 100-something pages. The book basically begins with ""Johnny is going to die. Lemme tell you all about it. Every day of it."" And so on. The plot is alright, but there needed to be more added to it to keep things interesting. It tells you of his slow struggle with death by nearly each excruciating day. Most of the time, it's nothing interesting at all! It's like: Johnny went in for testing. Now I'm going to tell you all about his cancer, all over again. And the testing that happened, and what witty things he said to the nurse, and so on. It's awful. I skipped twenty pages, and I found I was able to pick up exactly where I had left off twenty pages ago. I had missed nothing. That's how much it drags. It's a miserable excuse for literature."
4,"A story of love,adventures,and death,throughout one family.","The father who is so desperate for answers, and a mother so nieve towards the situation, both have an extream love for there son, Johnny. As Johnny fights for his life, throughout a terrible brain tummor, he looses much of his incredible abilities, and memories. This book not only tells a great story, but brings you to understand illness, that one day could happen to you."
5,magnficent true story,"I read this recommended by my school librarian. I was touched. Jonny Gunther was 16 years odl when he got his brain tumor, and for the next 15 months he endured tests, surgery, and pain because of this tumor. He was a scientists and always love to experiment. Constantly his father brought him chemicals for these. He was an amazingy student even with his brain student. Jonny had a different kind of tumor that you wouldn't normally seem. It was on the right side of his brain so he was effected much by it. The saddest part of the story is the day he died. The tumor hit a blood vein causing it to burst and Jonny slowly lost his life. His parents tried everything they could do to save him, and his mother said she wish they had loved him more. His father wrote this story to tell people how his son survived in agony, and how we can too."
2,The fun doesn't last...,"Our energetic son loved this cute set and paraded around the house with his ""band"". However, these instruments aren't durable. After a couple uses, paint already chipped off the maracas, there is a hole in the fish, one clapper broke, and chunks of wooden have fallen off the zebra clapper. We have to toss the set now due to choking hazards and are looking for a new, lasting set of instruments."
4,Where do I sign up?,"Take a group of highly talented jazzmen - you've got Skerik, Stanton moore and Charlie Hunter to name a few - and get them to cut their teeth on the sonic 'blaze' that is Previte's imagination, and you get a spontaneous hard drivin' energy that you can feel as much as hear. This is a great piece of all-out-brawling rock-jazz. It breaks the mould of genre-bound categorization and presents a fresh contemporary approach to instrumental music.I first heard of Previte in relation to his Latitude series of discs he cut with Charlie Hunter, but have not yet had the chance to sample that series. After hearing this, that's my next stop. Previte's coalition of the willing? Where do I sign up!"
4,"Highly entertaining, if not wildly original...","... which about says it all. If you don't have a detailed knowledge of Previte's past work, the fact that he reworks some old compositions won't matter. It's a highly entertaining, highly energetic album. (It reminds me of The President's ""Bring Yr Camera"", a Wayne Horvitz project that Previte was a part of.)Complaining that he reworks some earlier compositions for a new line-up of musicians seems beside the point. Jazz musicians do that all the time.This isn't cutting edge, but it it's tremendously entertaining. Given the line-up, it's more in the ballpark of Galactic or Critters Buggin.To hear something recent that's more adventurous from Previte, try Groundtruther's ""Longitude"" (with Charlie Hunter and DJ Logic). In fact, it's Charlie Hunter who really climbs out of his rut on both albums."
1,More rehash from Previte,"Bobby Previte died a creative death a long time ago, he just doesn't know it yet. Unfortunately those that are not familiar with his music might think the ""Coalition"" is really cutting edge stuff, ""strikingly original"", or whatever your favorite jazz adjective might be. But it's not. Listen closely. Does track 1 (""The Ministry of Truth"") sound familiar? That's because it's a rehash of one of Previte's old tunes from one of the Latin for Travelers records. A few tracks later on ""Coalition"" we get a rehash of the first tune off Previte's Empty Suits record, and not a very good one at that. Both tunes are conveniently renamed of course, to deceive the listener that they're getting something new. This technique of ""self rip-off"" is nothing new to Previte as he's done it many times in the past, with the album ""Corporate Art"" being a prime example.""Ministry of Truth"" is an apt title. Previte could use a little dose of the truth himself."
2,Pretty Good Book/Good Chocolate Descriptions,I have to compliment the chocolate descriptions. They are so real you'll want to buy chocolates. But the book was too long and had too much descriptive detail. Half as much descriptive detail and half as many pages would have been fine.
3,"Mediocre book, but the truffles are good!","You might as well buy a box of truffles before you start reading this book. There are many pages describing the making of chocolate desserts and candies - especially truffles that by the middle of the book you have a huge craving.The story line/plot in Such Devoted Sisters is good and well developed. The plot kept me reading the book. I especially wanted to see which sister Joe ends up with and why. Eileen Goudge is a good story teller and I enjoyed her exploration of family members relationships (esp. sisters) through good times and bad.This book, however, reminded me of Danielle Steel's books because Eileen Goudge tends to be verbose and repetitious. I found myself skipping passages due to the redundancy of the characters thoughts.Overall, the plot was good, though the book was too long and overly descriptive."
5,Must Disagree,"This was one of my favorite books of all time, don't understand the poor reviews!!!!! Don't let them sway you away from this book!!!!!"
5,Five guys. One safe. No brains.,"What a great little movie. I had never heard of this, but it popped up on my recommendations and got good reviews, so I gave it a try. This so much reminded me of Donald Westlake's comic crime caper novels. A great little story with plenty of laughs. The plot involves a group of low rent, misfit criminals trying to pull of a heist of a lifetime, or as the call it, their 'Bellini'. Well, complications occur, problems arise, and the whole thing gets rather messy. William H. Macy is great along with Isaiah Washington, Sam Rockwell, Michael Jeter, and Luis Guzman. A great ensemble cast in a highly enjoyable, funny movie. A sad note, I had heard Michael Jeter died recently, which is quite sad. I thought he was great in the Green Mile."
1,With out a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen.,"I didn't even want to give this movie 1 star. I reccomend that all of you avoid this movie like the plague. I hope every actor in this film never gets to star in another film. This film is a pathetic recreation one of my favorite films ""Big Deal on Madonna St."" Not one moment ""Weclome to Collingwood"" was pleasant to me. Why? Cause everything about it was poorly excecuted and cheap. The worst part of all of it was poor delivery of the jokes in the film. I didn't even laugh once.Watching this film was like watching a street vendor sell fake Gucci bags and Bolex watches."
1,Packaging horrible,Haven't watched it yet. It's packaged in one of those archaic hard to open plastic hinge gizmos. Its damaged and scratched. Needs to be in a hard snap case or you're wasting your time.
1,Stick with the original!,"Probably not too many viewers realize that 'Welcome to Collinwood' is a remake of a brilliantly funny Italian movie 'Big Deal on Madonna Street'. Unfortunately, the features that made the original sparkle (great characters depicted with love and care), are not present in 'Welcome to Collinwood'. What's left is an uninspired mess. The characters that were supposed to represent the Italian soul were not successfully transformed to American soil. Instead, they were shamelessly copied from the original. As a result, the characters and many scenes in 'Welcome to Collinwood' do not make sense and look contrived."
4,Works better than I expected,"Easy to push, quiet, does a great job. It does leave a few of the longer strands at times, but I have an electric weedeater for taking care of that. It cuts weeds just fine. The best part is that it is light weight to you don't get blisters on your hands from having to grip so hard to control and push it. I've mowed the lawn at 9:00 at night. (not as hot then) It is quiet enough not to bother the neighbors. Kids could definitely use this."
4,Good for frequent quick mows but still need a powered mower as backup,"Just like other reviews, reel mowers won't cut stray grass strands that exceed certain height. It's obvious by just looking at the mechanics of these mowers. I don't want to repeat what the other reviewers already said but can say that virtuall all disadvantages mentioned are true. It's good for small, debris free yards. I use it for quick touchups to keep the grass short but once a while I'd plugin the electric mower to produce a clean, professional cut. The power mower has the ability to suck up debris and provide a more uniform cut including the edges."
4,"Not great, but useable","Handle bolts together, so it flexes more than it should. Presumably the handle is manufactured of multiple pieces so it can be shipped from China in a small box.It cuts well (short grass only). For long grass and/or weeds I gas-up my power mowers."
1,Garbage,"I'm in my 60's and grew up pushing a reel mower. I know what a joy it can be to mow your lawn with a push reel mower. This, however has been nothing but a frustration to me. I complained to the company, and the answer was effectively ""sorry 'bout that."" First, it wouldn't cut high grass. I can live with that. It won't cut flower stems from weeds in the lawn. Didn't like that. So I pulled up the lawn and put in a brand new sod lawn. It cuts pretty well, if you don't mind cutting several ways, and on consecutive days during the fast growing season in Spring. The major complaint I have is that now that I have a new, soft lawn, the mower won't stay in adjustment, so it soon looks like I tore the lawn instead of mowing it, and the anvil and blades don't meet at all spots on the anvil or blades. Other mowers I've had cut like a pair of scissors all along the anvil. This one won't and it is way too expensive to get it repaired. I won't buy anything from this company."
3,A green consumer,"I got this mower because I like the idea of not adding to the pollution problem. It lives up to that all right, but doesn't exactly deliver when it comes to a clean cut. My lawn is hybrid Bermuda, which is thick and about as tough as grass can get. I raise my power mower deck to 3"" in the summer to protect the grass from drought. At a little over 2"", this mower isn't quite high enough for a Bermuda lawn. Forget about twigs, the grass alone can stop the blades! Also, the cut was nowhere near as clean as with my power mower. I gave up after an hour and used the power mower to finish the lawn. Once the lawn was cut I found that I could get this mower to work reasonably well if I set it to its maximum height. I also found that lubricating the blades with WD-40 is essential. Overall, this mower is not great, but is not bad either. It won't completely replace my power mower, but I'll use it in late fall and winter when I mow the grass at a lower height."
2,simply doesn't work well,"I really wanted to mow the yard without using gas. Unfortunately even multiple passes fail to cut all the grass. The front of the mower pushes down taller grass and prevents it from cutting it. I have to borrow my neighbors gas mower when the lawn is long and then besure to mow twice a week to make this work. Unless you have time to mow often, consider carefully."
4,Great lawn mower being totally human powered,"I like my push powered lawn mower for 3 reasons:1. I get to walk around and can hear the birds, wind, etc..., while giving it a good trim, and leaving nonclumpy clippings.2. No gasoline smell, nor gasoline consumption for cutting lawn(I really want to use my money for something other than cutting giant pieces of land only for looks and community regulations.)3. I understand pretty much everything on the machine, as it is really simple and durable. Quality joints and parts- US made.Two Dislikes:1. Any hard object about the size of a finger can stop man and machine immediately.2. I'm not in good enough shape to cover my entire backyard, as my mower takes more effort on my part. I usually pass by a patch of lawn twice to make sure I get the lengths even."
4,18 inch reel mower,"It works pretty well. And as many reviews mentioned, it will be stuck if there is a little stick getting in the blade. A good means of exercising and working on yards at the same time. A lot quieter than a gas mower and no gas smell. I love it."
3,Quiet/Enviro-friendly but not a great cutting mower,"It's very hard to cut thick st. augustine(takes some muscle)and it's not a clean cut on other grasses. However, It may be great for a patio home with bermuda grass. I like cutting with it in the few patches of grass I can cut with it, but I can't give up the gas mower altogether."
5,Practical and Easy To Use,"I bought this mower after going through a gas motor on average every two years. I was pleasently surprised to discover that this mower moved through the grass as quickly and as easily as a power mower. It did an excellent job and it didn't pick up and chew rocks up like my power motors. It does the job. It almost seems too easy. Ofcourse, I only have a third of an acre, but can do it just as quickly as with a power mower and I am saving gas, tune ups, breakdowns, and the environment. If the grass does get too long you may have to do a double run in a few areas, but not a big deal."
3,Made in China,"I googled lawnmowers made in the USA and came up with a site that said that this brand and model is made in the USA. So I got it. The box clearly says ""Made in China."" Oh well. Hard to find anything made in the USA anymore. It cuts the lawn OK, though. I'm glad I got this type of non-motorized lawnmower."
3,Screw loose,"A decent, easy to use manual lawn mower. It glides easily over grass with minimal effort and makes a quiet sound which is nice considering the massive noise made by morons who buy a Sherman tank to mow a ten foot square lawn.The problem is the mower is assembled with plastic wing nut type screws. Aside from the fact the plastic nuts will eventually brake, they unloosen themselves. I went to use the mower one day and found the left side of the top of the handle loose. The wing nut fell off somewhere and I spent 30 minutes walking around looking for it. I finally found it and put it back on.Another problem is that the slightest twig will immobilize the blades and so one must too often stop and clear out any obstruction."
5,lawn never looked so good,"This mower is easy to use and effective. It gave a very even cut. Twigs will jam it occasionally, however some twigs it will roll over and some it can snap and keep going. It is a bigger workout than I ever got using my electric mower. I mostly felt the strain in my forearms, but it really is not difficult. Cut all the fescue, bluegrass, clover, violets, crab grass, dandelions, etc. I have in my lawn with no problems, and my lawn looks better than it ever has. Cuttings do collect on the bottom bar which I found a little annoying, but I just blew it off prior to storage. I'm very happy with the purchase and would recommend this mower to anyone."
4,Good quality mower,"The mower arrived quickly and in good condition. It is a good quality item and mows well. The only difficulty I had was in assembly; primarily attaching the handle to the blades. Because the handle is good quality, it did not bend easily to attach it to the 2 holding studs. If you get this mower, I recommend that you first attach the lower handle to the blades, then attach the upper part. It was still hard to push but at least I was able to get it done without help. All-in-all, I would recommend this mower."
4,Not perfect but it does the job,"If you have never used a push reel mower, don't expect miracles. However, as push reel mowers go, it is acceptable and the price is reasonable. It is a bit harder to push than Scott's push reel mower which has 4 wheels but cuts about the same."
3,decent,"This lawnmower works well, but I'd only recommend it for small yards. Also, the handle bars could stand to be more sturdy."
1,"Easy broken, insecure, noisy, and all by yourself","Overall, unless the lawn is unhealthy thin, it's a useless product.First, it gets stucked all the time. If you push harder, the second row of wheels comes out. The second row of wheels are made of plastic and insecurely attached.Second, there is no protection on the blade. When try to install the mower or fixed the above problem, you figers might get in the blade. It's extremly dangerous if you have children around.Third, it makes sharp noice (The blades are scratching the steel) when it is rolling.Fourth, the product also hides a notice, which says that the product can not be returned to the seller and the customer needs to contact manufacturer for all the problems."
1,it's worthless,"I don't understand how anyone could be happy with this mower. The mower I received the blades weren't even sharpened. It cut next to nothing and one had to mow over and over again and it wouldn't cut much. Took mower apart to get blade sharpened and I could not find anyone who wanted to sharpen a reel blade. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS, MINE IS IN THE JUNK PILE"
5,very useful,"Push mover remined me of being a kid. Assembly was very quick and easy. mower works great. I got the sharpener kit. When I was reading the operational instructions, found the mower blade can turned around to sharpen blade,though, it seemed very difficult to set it up. Also, instructions stated no need to sharpen for approximately 3 years or more. Still don't mind having tool, when time to sharpen the blade arrives, better to have the blade sharpner than not ."
4,Solid,"I have used this mower throughout this summer (2012). Haven't had to sharpen it once and it has cut well every time. Took a little getting used to as I have used power mowers my whole life, but once I did it was a much more enjoyable experience.Need to know how to adjust the blades so you get a good cut.It's great because you can immediately see how to take it apart. Easier DIY care than anything motorized."
5,Works well for smaller yards,"Assembly was simple enough, getting the c-clamps was a little tough but its a one time thing. I have been using it at the default blade height but may drop it a little. We have a small townhouse in Houston (25' x 25' lawn), it cuts through our grass no problem. As others have said, it will get stuck with the smallest of sticks, but that's just the way the design works. Not hard to get out, but best to just make sure there are no debris before you start. Pushing it is really easy, though we have a flat lawn. I can finish my yard quickly then just hang it in the corner of the garage. No gas, takes up little space, loving it so far. If I had a bigger yard it would be a nice work out too.I've only used it 3 times so far, but loving it."
1,hard to push in thick grass,"I was really looking forward to using a no gas mower, but..... I couldn't get this product to work in St. Augustine grass if it was the least bit thick. I do believe that you need to be taller than 5 foot 2 inches as well to get the right angle for optimal push power. I got only a portion of my yard done and had to go buy a gas mower in order to get the rest of it done."
3,"good, but needs lots of wd40","My 13 yo dtr is a eco nut and wanted a push mower for her birthday (guess who doesn't use it now). Anyway, it cuts pretty well if you don't let the grass get too high, otherwise is hard to push, and it bends and rolls over the tallest grass rather than cutting it.The biggest problem though,is that after 10 minutes or so, especially in damp grass, it gets hard to push and makes noise. We found that if you spray the blades with wd40, it goes back to normal. But that's counter eco friendly, expensive, and annoying."
4,Good mower for my little yard,"We live in a metro area town home and have a very (I mean very) small yard. This little mower works perfectly for our situation. If the grass gets especially thick, it takes a couple of passes to mow properly, but I can't complain a bit."
2,"Doesn't deliver as a ""companion""","I bought this book for our public library's reference collection. Reviews indicated that this book would be an excellent source of information about wine. It falls far short of that. One example: I needed it for a definition of ""syrah"" (which they refer to in an article) - neither the alphabetical arrangement of the book nor the index yielded anything. This is a coffee table book and nothing more."
3,bla,"The game runs slow on a G4 with 1/2 Gig of ram. The colors are kinda drab and I think Myth 2 looks better. On top of it all, you can still play people in myth 2 on playmyth.net (with a patch). You can also play M3 on playmyth, but you are unlikely to find any opponents.In short, go get myth 2. It is cheaper and you can find people to play against in it."
5,NEVER LISTEN TO THE CRITICS!,"It has been a long time since ""Touch"" was released and if you liked that album, you must order this CD. It consists of 4 'not so popular' songs from ""Touch"" and remixed by Jellybean and Francois Kevorian. These remixes are not sped up to that annoying level of most remixes. They have a smooth, funky dance tempo and Annie's voice sounds great! REGRETS is my favorite. I have been looking at this CD for awhile and was not sure about it because of it's editorial review. I wish I had ordered it a long time ago. A definate recommendation to Eurythmics fans!"
2,bad reception,I needed to install this after my antenna cable on my ford ranger rotted out. I was unable to fish a new cable using the old one so I need a new antenna. I read the reviews and this seemed to be good for my application. It does not work as good as the factory antenna. I live about 50 miles west of NYC and 60 miles north of Philadelphia and I would be able to pick up stations from either city depending on what side of the mountain I was on. Now neither come in and my local stations come in with static. Once I am within 20 miles of NYC it works fine.
2,Save your money,"Got off to a bad start with this transaction - the seller didn't put enough postage on the package, so I had to waste over an hour and $1.79 to collect it from the local post office. I was not impressed.I was also not impressed with the way this antenna works either - it does increase the signal strength, but it also increases the noise so there is only a marginal improvement.I am still looking for a better solution."
2,Not as represented,"I ordered a new Metra brand hidden antenna, however I received a used/or returned Antenna Works brand antenna packaged in a dirty sandwich bag. In the bag was an obviously not new antenna and the remnants of a Antenna Works package label. Complete scam and waste of my time and money.(by the way this is your second request for my review, which I previously sent)Too bad...I am now reluctant to do further business with Amazon."
5,"A 'MUST HAVE"" for all TRUE race fans.","If you are a NASCAR fan you MUST have this book. The pictures are superb. The one on page 114 alone is worth the cost of the book. It is well written and gives not only a history of the Busch series but a look into the ""personalities"" that made this sport famous.This is no ordinary paper back. The quality is outstanding. When you're finished, don't put it on a shelf. It deserves to be out on the coffee table for all to see and enjoy."
2,Close but no cigar,"This kit was provided free with my head unit purchase. Unfortunately, it is not a good fit for the Sentra or an exact color match for the black interior (as in my 2005 SE-R Spec V). The texture also doesn't match the surrounding trim. I found one other kit on Amazon, the Metra 99-7414, which fits perfectly and matches the black interior with a better texture."
5,Awesome! Funny as funny can be!,"I saw her on HBO, and loved every minute of the show. She was funny, hilarious!. WHenever they show Mars pictures on teh tv, can't help but laugh at the jokes Wanda made onthe show about the space program! Got a watch it!"
5,funny,"Wanda Sykes is honestly one of the funniest female comedians I have seen in a while. While I enjoyed her briefly run show that aired on Fox back in the day, whenever she makes an appearance on a television show I feel the need to stop doing whatever it is at the moment and pay attention to Wanda's hilarious jokes. Sick and Tired will entertain audiences for the entire running time. It's just a great great comedy special that I hope you enjoy as much as I did."
1,Too Much 4 Me,Gosh this is so trashly coming from a female.All about sex who care about all that crap.If you enjoy dirty talk this will do.
2,Sick and tired,"by the end of this i was sick and tired, literally i fell asleep. this is not one of Wanda's best works sad to say.keep your money buy a book instead."
5,shes funny,super funny wanda sykes makes alot of good points and if you have even seen monster in law and her humor you'll like this dvd
5,"Wanda Sykes! Amazon, you've done it again....","This was good to watch...not bad!-Timothon24@Facebook.com>> I wish this had a facebook link! This was for audiences 13+ages= mature/ 13 times mature equals ""maturity"" Lol!"
1,What a waste,"I've really enjoyed seeing Wanda Sykes in various movies and television shows and that was the reason for this purchase. I thought this dvd would be hilarious just because of her. How wrong I was. It is a snore and most of her jokes just don't make sense to anyone, except for her. I think she should have the writers from the movies and television shows write her stand up as clearly in this dvd it is sorely needed. I so wanted this dvd to be good, but I couldn't wait for it to be over."
1,Just Give Me a Break,When is she going to quite dissing everyone in the guise of humor? She may be funny to some; but only those who share her racist and openly hostile humor against anyone not like her. I regret watching this.
2,Too much about politics,"I love Wanda and think she is one of the funniest comedians, but I really didn't like how she used jokes to state her opinions about politics especially since there were some inacuracies. Besides the political jokes it was great."
2,Wanda Sykes,"I gave this DVD to my sister because she thinks Wanda Sykes is hysterical but she was VERY disappointed in this DVD. My sister said this DVD was all political, she said there were some funny parts but for the most part Wanda just talks about politics."
1,"Limited budget, poorly done, resorts to vulgar language, a real waste compared to previous works.","Don't waste your money on this. ""Wanda Sykes: Tongue Untied"" from when she was at Comedy Central is excellent, she performs with true wit and humor, that touches her audience."
2,Wanda Sykes - Sick and Tired,I really like Wanda Sykes. I thought Toungue Untied was very funny. On this new DVD Sick and Tired I was very dissapointed in her performance. I hope she is better on the next DVD. Not nearly as good as Toungue Untied.
1,NO point in Profanity,It doesn't make it funnier with profanity. Comedians use it to mask their lack of talent. She just isn't that funny.
5,The Ultimate Rainforest Anthology,"Not only has the compiler chosen the most attractive, rhythmically fascinating, and colorful selections, he/she has also seamlessly blended them together in succession with jungle and rainforest ambiance. The result i"
4,Swedish Raw Nitro Rock,"This is The Peepshows second album and it's really good. It reminds me a bit of Turbonegro (listen to Turn me on), an even greater band. Cheap Thrills, No Excuses, Right Now and Thy Will are simply great although the greatest is City of The Damned, one of the best songs I ever heard. These guys really know how to rock and roll and I highly recommend it!"
5,One of the great lands of the middle east,"This book about Iran makes the coutry much more interesting to learn about that include different things like the people which include: The Persians (51%), Kurds, Azeris, Baluchis, Lurs, Arabs, Georgians, Armenains, and Jews. And the religion which the majority of Iranians follow Shia Islam (89-90%)."
2,Not a Demi Glace...its a base,"To call this a Demi Glace is all wrong. It is a base. Just read the ingredients: Corn oil (tbhq added to protect flavor), modified food starch, partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oil, maltodextrin, water, salt, sugar, hydrolyzed (corn, soy, wheat gluten, soy) proteins, beef extract, yeast extract, beef fat, onion powder, caramel color (contains sulfites), beef stock, garlic powder, mono and diglycerides, soy sauce (soybeans, wheat, salt), natural flavoring, disodium inosinate/disodium guanylate, and lactic acid.Way down on the ingredients list you find ""beef extract"", ""beef fat"" and ""beef stock"". These are not the ingredients for a Demi Glace. More like a commercial soup base."
1,warped wooden sword,"The wooden sword was warped and not straight. There was a one-inch curve difference from one edge of the sword to the other. I believe the wood was not dried enough and had warped due to humidity. Although the merchant agreed to take the sword back, the shipping cost that I paid in total would have cost the same as the sword."
5,latest thinking on reputation assurance,"I have read several books on this subject, looking for practical advice on how to develop a managed reputation for my company. I am a Communications Manager with 20 years' experience. This is the first book I've seen that offers a ""how to"" guide to implementation, which is a big step forward from previous texts which only documented the phenomenon (not very helpful if you're wanting to move on from hand wringing to problem solving). The work is easy to read and authoritative. It contains appendices that show specifically how to implement reputation assurance programmes. I recommend it highly to any PR practitioner, CEO or Board member interested in moving their organisation ahead of public opinion. If you follow the roadmap provided, you have the opportunity to make a quantum leap in the reputation stakes."
2,Didnt' smell like the original,"I LOVE this cologne, however, this one seemed like it was watered down. It didn't smell the same and had a different odor throughout the day. Too bad, I was really really disappointed. I will just have to go to a department store and pick it up :("
5,Big bottle at an unbelievable price.,"I first bought the small bottle of this for my wife, and she loved it. So, when it was almost gone, I got this 3.4oz bottle for only $30."
5,So dlish...,This is another one of my favorites. This perfume lasts the wholeee day. It's such a fresh smelling perfume. My cousin has me hooked on this perfume. And the price is great. Her husband bought it at macys or saks and he paid $70.00 for a large bottle. Amazon has a great price on it.
3,"Smells great, bottle leaks","The perfume is exactly what my wife wanted, but the top leaks. She's tried everything to make it stop, but it can't be helped."
1,Tester,"Although the bottle in the picture has a lid, the product I received did not. This is a TESTER."
1,"Okay when it works, unacceptable wait for warranty repair.","The scanner quit working after about 5 weeks. Wasted a week dealing with Wasp support. Finally returned to Wasp for warranty repair. 3 months later, after numerous phone calls, emails etc, it finally came back. It works, but I will not buy another Wasp product."
3,"good book, lot of advice, but not always useful","This book is written by a psychologist and an educator (neither of whom ""attended"" medical school) and it shows; although there is a vast amount of information and advice in this book, it's often not very useful to the medical student. Reading this book reminds of fans at hockey games that have never played hockey, but still yell ""SHOOT, PASS, GO LEFT.."" It's very easy to give advice from the side-line, but unless you're actually doing it, it's hard to have a good idea of what it's like.In anticipation for medical school, i've also read ""how to excel in medical school"", and more recently ""how to study in medical school"", and i can honestly say the better books are those authored by MD's (such as the latter two), hence authors that have gone through the process themselves. I feel their advice is a lot more practical and applicable.Overall good, but if i had to choose just one book, i'd probably choose something else."
5,Awesome,Awesome book. Great tools to study for med school. lots of exercises to practice the material in the book. I definitely recommend it to others for review and study tips.
5,"completely relatable, utterly engrossing, outrageously entertaining","I'm not a teen, but just feel like one, reading this excellent semi-autobiographical fiction. Funny and touching, reminiscent of ""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius"" by Dave Eggers, but for teens. This quick paced books will make you laugh, grimace in embarrassment and shared angst, and root, root, root for Nick."
5,Sometimes We are the Source of Our Problems,"Nick Park is the only Korean American youth growing up in a white suburb. He is good at sports, but not popular and he has problems with girls, to say the least. He has low self-esteem and tries to cover it up by going out of his way to get attention. In fact the book starts out with Nick missing his graduation rehearsal, because he made a jerk of himself in front of a girl at the prom.He blams the fact that he's Korean for his problems when really his problems lie within himself. He wants to belong, to be popular, but he makes it difficult for others to get to know him with his embarrassing antics. This is at times a shocking book and at other times very funny. David Yoo has somehow put a bit of all of us in Nick Park, making him a very real character who you will be thinking about long after you finish this book. I just loved it."
4,Para los que se toman la lectura en serio,Recomiendo leer antes otras obras de Roberto Bolaño comoLos Detectives Salvajes/the Savage Detectives (Spanish Edition)antes de embarcarse en 2666.El libro tiene más de mil páginas y está dividido en cinco partes; la última es la que hace que valga la pena.Recomendado para los que se toman la lectura en serio.
4,A must for pokemon fans,While playing his pokemon games my son refers to his handbooks to help him strategize the best way to defeat his opponent.
2,Used ok-Written in NOT OK,"When I purchased this book I expected the pages to be a little bent at the edges,normal wear and tear. What I did not expect was for the childs name to be wriiten on four different pages in the book!!! Had I known this I would not have purchased it since the book was intended as part of a gift for a child who loves pokemon. This was the case for both books that I purchased!"
4,Good basic character shoe,"I ordered 1/2 a size larger than normal and wore these straight out of the box with no discomfort. I discovered that these shoes aren't really meant for outdoor walking, though, as the heels began wearing down quickly after about 10 blocks. So, I'll just keep them on indoors, which I suppose is the idea anyway."
2,Not for bad feet,Take it from someone who has very tough feet to make happy! This Leo shoe is way too stiff for someone with bunions or bad feet. It can't compare with the Capezio 700 t-strap which worked well for me once I got it stretched a little.
4,Stranger at The Gate,I read this book after my first Soul Force meeting...had to know more. Mel White's story is great.
4,A good eye-opener for thoughtful Christians,"It seems that some of the readers haven't actually READ the book, just saw what it dealt with and did some reflex Leviticus quoting.If you are a Christian struggling to come to term with your sexuality, read this book. If you are GLBTQ and want insight into the lives of what your sisters and brothers embroiled in fundamentalism are up against, read this book.If you're a minister in a conservative church, read this book. If you're a thoughtful Christian who adamently believes that homosexuality is a sin, read this book.Why? Because understanding each other is important, no matter where you're at. Hearing the actual stories and struggles of another may shake your convictions a little bit, but it's something that should be done."
5,White eliminates the wedge between sexuality & spirituality,"Being a gay Christian youth, I cannot describe the angst I shared with Mel and his early years. This thorough, engaging autobiography reaches out to Americans, both gay and straight, across the country and shows them how distorted a doctrine of hate and fear has made them. An engaging and candid story"
4,Great Book,"As a 22 year old college student, and starting to be in the spotlight, this book expanded my mind, and most defentily helped me come out and be who I am. This book also gave me the history of our Gay Community, since i've read this book a few folks have come up to me and bashed me for who I am this book gave me reason to stand up for who I am and in fact changed their views on homosexuality."
3,Interesting look at prejudice in action,I bought this book for a gift after reading one from library. I was impressed by what the author has achieved against prejudice.
4,"To be Gay and Christian in North Ringwood, Australia",I thought it would be nice for readers to receive a view from a gay man who loves the Lord Jesus Christ in Australia.I think I always knew I was gay but found I had terribly conflicting feelings growing up within the North Ringwood Baptist Church. Reverend Ernie Felchier would preach the strength of the gospel while I would hide my terrible shame. I did learn to accept my homosexuality with time and now I jump at the opportunity to find books that deal with my struggle. Hear hear Mel White.....thank you and God bless you !!
5,Surprisingly as good as HOME,"I love spearhead and he keeps making good music. I loved his first album, home. I wish that he would get more mainstream. More people should listen to this great combonation of funk, soul, and hip-hop. It is great music with a message. GET THIS C.D."
4,Franti does it again,I have Home & Stay Human so I thought I would p/u CSH. If you enjoy the others you will like this one also. Franti doing it again - provocative rhymes over great beats.
3,3 SPEEDS - NOT VARIABLE,"The title is mis-leading - the switch is 3 speeds plus off, NOT ""fully variable"". The product information even says this - Amazon needs to correct the listing.OTHER than that, the switch is as it promises and comes with both white and ivory knobs."
2,Hillbilly What?,"ok, I bought this cd and it gets 2 stars one each for the songs ""Believe"" and ""I'm Building Bridges"". The other songs are horrible. Ronnie is the lead vocalist for a VERY good reason! They were very smart to get Vince Gill(the best!)to do background vocals on Bridge's. Save your money or you too will be adding this one to your yard sale!"
1,Worst Effort from a Solid Duo,"I thought something must be wrong with my stereo when I first played this cd. Brooks and Dunn have created some great work, but this is far from it. Many of the songs are so dischordant, I would swear that the studio engineer had gone tone deaf or something. About two decent songs, the rest are not worth having around. Try some earlier stuff for a better taste of their talent."
5,Hillbilly deluxe,Best cd by them ever.Too bad they stopped recording.I hope they get back to it soon.Thanks. Charlie
2,Wrong CD,"My daughter gave me the wrong title. This was not the CD she wanted, so I ended up returning it. By the time I paid the postage and restocking fee, I ended up getting very little money back for returning it."
4,Great music.,"My son likes several of the songs on this CD, they are a little hip and so the younger age group of kids likes their music too and you know its good music with good lyrics."
4,Great CD,After seeing Brooks & Dunn last week my wife just had to have the CD that had most of the songs she liked. The CD came in a timely manner and in perfect condition.
1,How many times can you misspell awful in 1 review?,"But yes, Brooks and Dunn are getting worse. They lost me as a fan with Steers and Stripes and I haven't heard anything on this album to win me back."
3,HILLBILLY DELUXE,"THERE ARE A FEW GOOD SONGS ON THIS CD. I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED BUT, ""BELIEVE"" IS EXCELLENT."
5,Their outstanding music is back!,"I have all B&D's CDs. The early ones I loved. The recent ones I don't even listen to as I don't like them. I had given up hope until I saw this one and read the reviews. I LOVE IT! Every tune is great except for the title song. They got just a little too rap/hip hop for me. That one I skip past as it really annoys me. The spiritual is uplifting, the foot stompers are marvelous. If you haven't bought any of theirs, buy this one. It's hard to stop playing it."
1,NOT WORTH BUYING,"I was going to buy this used on Amazon but decided to listen to it on Myspace first. Glad I did because the only song I like is ""Building Bridges"". I won't buy the CD just for one song when I can hear it free on my computer. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR KIX BROOKS SING LEAD!!!"
2,Not worth the money,This CD was a disappointment. There are too many songs sung by Brooks and not enough by Dunn. I like their hit songs because I like Dunn's voice. Who ever told Brooks he could sing???
1,A must avoid if you are more than 12 yrs old...,"I've just put the book down. I'm dumbfounded. The target audience of this book is surely 12 year olds. Anyone over that age, or who has read any decent suspense literature (King, Barker, Koontz -- if you don't know who they are, you'll probably like this book.), is going to be bored out of their minds. The plot is predictable, and the characters one-dimensional.A Summary of my opinion of the book: If it was a best seller, the books I publish in the future will be on the NY Times Best Seller list for eternity!"
1,Of course it is bad. Of course.,"I finished ""Cry for Strangers"" and felt the story silly. Now I am half way into ""Comes the Blind Furry"" and decided that this is going to be the last John Saul book I will ever read.The main problem with John Saul is that there is no strength in his stories. The main characters are either too stupid to fugure out things or too weak to act on things. The supporting characters shair the same problem with added indeference.Stories don't have to have happy endings. Main characters don't have to be perfect. But they have to have something different about them to attaract the readers. John Saul's characters are too bland, too mediocre to carry a story. And it is just painful to read."
4,One of Saul's classic tales.,"Comes the Blind Fury is one of John Saul's early classics. It contains all the elements that the writer's fans expect and love...a dysfunctional family, teen (or pre-teen) angst, a gothic/small town setting, a dollop of the supernatural (that would turn technological within a few books) hidden within a mystery that goes back into the town's early history, and murder.Once again a troubled family moves to a small town in the hopes of starting fresh. Sadly their adopted daughter's inner emotional turmoil attracts the restless and revenge thristing spirit of a blind girl that met a tragic end nearly one hundred years ago (hence the title). As the girl's sanity weakens the spirit grows stronger and the bodies began piling up. Saul's fourth novel (following Suffer the Children, Punish the Sinners, and Cry for the Strangers) is one of his best, a tight and polished thriller that delivers the chills. Recommended."
2,Off the mark,"This book has lots of spooky elements - a ghost, an indestructible doll, an old man with family secrets, automatic drawing, a mysterious stain that won't go away. Any of these ingredients might be a good core for a thriller, but they don't come together in any meaningful way. Throw in a well-adjusted child turned instantly neurotic, a maladjusted dad, whose fragile psyche could never have survived medical school, and an ineffectual mother and you've got motives as murky as the fog that heralds the ghost's arrival. The plot revolves around ""little children"" who - at 12 - inexplicably speak and act like eight-year-olds. There isn't enough reality here to make the supernatural aspects effective."
1,B-o-r-i-n-g,"I have not read a Saul book in years and I really don't know why I downloaded this, but I remember enjoying them when I was younger. I guess I would classify this as young adult fiction because I can't imagine many adults being sold on this very shallow boring ghost story. Nothing happens for so long that I almost gave up then there is a section where all h-e-double toothpicks breaks lose and it become a bloodless bloodbath as it were. I read this while commuting to and from work and had about five pages left after I made it home; I was still not sufficiently entertained to read those last few pages until my next commute. I think the title cracked me up so much that I chose it for that. It is what it is."
2,Bland and unconvincing,"This is my third Saul book and may be the last. I found this book annoying and frustrating. There were too many unnecessary characters who were too weak to do anything. I found June the most frustrating. How could she NOT stand up to her husband? Was he seriously affected that bad by his daughter's accident or was something supernatural at work? And Michelle's ""friends"" were so bowled over by the mean-spirited twit Susan that they physically could NOT stand up to her when she was being mean to Michelle? Not to mention, I wanted to know more about the little blind girl and her back story. Why did she pick those particular kids to harm? This book had an amazing concept that someone like Stephen King could have worked wonders with. Saul just seemed to flail around and not know what to do with it. The ending was somewhat satisfying which is the only reason I gave this two stars. Such a shame."
2,"Suspenseful, Creepy Ghost Story","This book captivated my attention even though it was very creepy and spooky. It's the only ghost story I ever read so don't really have anything to compare it to. I can't really say I liked it, because I don't like being creeped out and scared, but if you do, then this books for you. It's about a girl, Amanda, who was blind and was forced off a cliff, died and now haunts other 12-yr. old girls. Michelle, an adopted girl, moved from Boston to Paradise Point and found an old doll in her house the she named ""Amanda."" The ghost girl came to visit her and they became friends. When someone teased Michelle, the ghost would come and arrange some sort of ""accident"" so they would die. This happens over and over to build up the suspense and excitement. I'm not going to tell the ending though, because I don't want to spoil it for you.--Karen Arlettaz Zemek, Author of ""My Funny Dad, Harry"""
2,"good beginning, but.....",lost it after that. The book started out with a good story line but in the middle and end it just left me irritated and disapointed. DID Cal ever figure out how much he had hurt Michelle with his behavior? Did he ever fugure out that she died thinking he did not love her? Cal was very unlikeable to me and seems to have gotten off too easy. If he was so afraid of kids then why was he not afraid of his newborn daughter? Did Jeffs mother ever blame the family for her sons death? Perhaps I am putting more into the book than it deserves but I do not like to be left with unanswered questions and I would have preffered to hear more about the blind girls life.
2,Nothing like I expected,"we bought the Imaginext Castle Christmas 2006 and ever since then my sons been asking for more things to go with it. But when I got these I was so disappointed.They don't really go with the castle because the feet are to small and can't work the platforms.The figures are made out of a cheaper plastic and the swords are easily bend, the helmets don't fit right at all, and the detailes on the figures are a very poor paint job.Not at all like the figures that came with the castle or the other additional packages we bought.Of cause my boys still play with them, but I can tell they sure prefer the original figures. The difference sure surprised me since all of them are imaginext and fisher price, but I didn't get a chance to call about it yet. Maybe there are two different production lines out and the difference can be told by the UPC or somehow else.Overall, I am extremely disappointed and wouldn't buy them again if I had the choice"
2,A disappointment,Being an avid Meat Loaf fan I was disappointed when listening to this CD. The songs didn't appear to be inspired and they were definitely not the memorable pieces that he has released before (and after). One possible reason for this is that this album was not produced (nor the songs written by) Jim Steinman.
1,Great Title - Lousy Album,"The wonderful ode to what we shall euphemistically call 'self abuse' of the title notwithstanding, this album reeks. To be honest you don't need this CD to partake in the 'solitary vice.' The later is a more effective form of entertainment. Considerably cheaper too!"
1,More of the same,"More of the same pompus, overblown, and pretentious junk that Meat Loaf has been churning out for some 20 years. There is nothing new here that hasn't been heard ad naseum a milion times before."
3,"Good, but not a must-have","I had become a big Enigma fan a couple of months ago and I have been searching for music of similar style since then. Though being a copycat is not always a good thing, it is tolerable if the music turns to be good enough. In the case of Quinn, the atmosphere here is enchanting, kind of like Karma by Delerium, yet it carries one of the biggest flaws Delerium made--repeating same kinds of music over and over again. It was quite satisfying upon the first listening, but I eventually got tired of it. Compared to ERA, Quinn has more variety, but I would rather play Enigma again."
3,Definately inspired by Enigma and Deep Forest!,"Contemporary dance rhythms, Gregorian chants, Pygmy chants, ethnic instruments, and electronic soundscapes ... we've heard it all before. That is, from Enigma and Deep Forest. Quinn is one of those bands who have followed in their footsteps and whose aim is obviously to appeal to this crowd.However, more fans of Deep Forest are likely to dig this cd than fans of Enigma are, as it lacks any depth or mystery, it's just ""pretty music"". The first half of this album is great, but the second half gets boring and repetative and isn't exactly professionally mixed. Therefore, all in all it is an average cd."
2,Great Expectations,"I had heard a lot of great things about this group and this album. Almost no one had given it a bad rating and so I bought it. I can honestly say that I have never been this disappointed with a cd purchase in years. The best song would have to be ""Dryad of the Woods"" and that would be because it's an instrumental. Daniel's voice is good but he does these stupid ""hacha-ump-a-ump-dup"" sounds in the middle of songs which takes so much away from the tracks. I wouldn't recommend this album to many people. I know there are tons of people out there that like it and like this type of music but I think a better purchase would have to be O.S.I. if you like this type of music."
2,"This is the same band that did ""Entropia""???","First, let me say that I am a big fan of Pain of Salvation's older material. ""Entropia"" and ""One Hour by the Concrete Lake"" are both excellent albums, and showed a talented band with tremendous potential. ""The Perfect Element"" was decent, but was well below those albums in songwriting quality. But this? Well, this is just abhorrent. I really can't even believe it's the same band. A band that once did such ambitious, original, interesting music has dumbed down to boring pop trash. I can't even stand to listen to this thing, and I've had it since the day it came out. The amount of fans that consider this their greatest work is just bewildering. I suspect that most of them are just fairweather fans, who had never even heard of them until ""The Perfect Element"" came out. I've been listening to them since ""One Hour..."", and I consider this to be well below their standards. I really hope the next album is better, because this is pathetic."
5,It finally clicked.,"I must apologize for previously giving this 2 stars. For the longest time, I was convinced this album would never grow on me, but finally it did. There is so much cool stuff here, and I really don't know why it took me so long to get into it. But I sure am glad it did. Pain of Salvation is such a great band, and they bring together such a myriad of textures and styles here. Actually, I'm still not crazy about ""This Heart of Mine"", but I find that it works really well within the flow of the album, to give it that diverse flavor. If you go from ""A Trace of Blood"" to ""Undertow"", it's really not the same.Anyway, this is great stuff. Probably still my least favorite PoS album, but definitely worth buying. The lesson to be learned is that even if you think you'll never like this band, you probably will sooner or later. Just be patient, and it'll hit you when you least expect it."
3,Not as good as The Perfect Element but...,"This is a good album, as you can see from reviews for the European and American releases. This one has a bonus track that's part of the concept and I think really belongs on the album. Amazon, fix your track names...'Walking every God'..'Chain Song'..'Rope Ending'...Somehow I don't think the japanese release mistranslated the titles this poorly. I mean, come on. Anyway, the import's worth getting instead of the other version because the bonus track is great."
4,"Great Album, But Sounds Too Familiar.","I am a great fan of Pain of Salvation. They are clearly one of the most melodic, emotionally-charged prog rock bands of our time. I absolutely loved The Perfect Element Part 1, and I love this album too. The only problem I have is that both albums sound too similar. The mood, the rhythms, the keyboard sounds, and even some of the melodies sound like they were lifted directly from The Perfect Element Part 1. Now, for those of us, like myself, who never wanted that album to end, this is a real treat. But I fear if you are looking for something different and new from this super-talented group, you will not find it on Remedy Lane."
1,Women's Bracelet,"I purchased this bracelet with a matching necklace last year for my sister as a Christmas gift. The bracelet broke one month after she received it. Took it to the jewelers to get it fixed, ended up costing alot to be fixed. Not happy with product and will not purchase this kind of jewelry from this vendor. Shipped quickly."
5,LOVE this bracelet,I bought this bracelet for myself for my birthday a couple of years ago and have received many compliments when I wear it - especially from others enjoying birthdays in the month of October.Buy this bracelet - you won't regret it.Sorry I did not write a review much sooner.
4,Better than the LP.... but....,"As I contemplated burning my old LP to a CDR, I figured what the heck, maybe it's in print as a CD. And sure enough it is. Now I have all of the original cuts in stereo. Plus I have some new tracks. The original tracks were worth buying the CD for (I am a long time GFR fan), but as far as the extra cuts go, well, I'm not enough of a fan to be excited about them. If anything, the inclusion of these cuts here is a good explanation of why they weren't released earlier. Ok, yes, they are 'other versions', and a live cut...but for the most part they do not hold my interest with their simple lyrics and less-than-complete flow...."
3,already for flinging,"The album cover itself was a premenition in itself. It came in a round cover, already for flinging....Actually the album wasn't that bad.It contained some good rockers and the long closer ""loneliness""...it's not classic but just a good old fashioned rock album"
1,Go buy a turntable!!,"This album sounds atrocious. The remastering job is a joke. I'm always amazed how record companies try to get you to buy the same album over and over again and in this case the CD. They use big words that sound good like ""Digitally remastered""+""24 bit mixing"" etc. The first cut of this horrible sounding rerelease had an usually amount of background hiss. Same was true of the second song. Hiss has never bothered me historically but in this case it did. What tapes were they using I wonder? The guitar sounds brittle and overall it was hard for me to judge the music since this CD sounded so awful. However, the bonus live tracks sound great and are packed full of dynamite. I have heard tracks from this album on vinyl and they sounded much better."
5,I Think This Is The Last Heavy Album Of Grand Funk Railroad,"Anyway,Hard And Heavy Album.Ofcourse next album(American Band and others) is also good.But,from ""On Time"" to this Album is most heavy sound days i think.I like this span of the band."
5,"Every rider has a story, and here are a few of them","If you're already familiar with Les Woodland's work, then he needs no introduction. If you're not, then you need to know that he's one of the most respected cycling writers in the business -- right up there with Richard Yates and Sam Abt.In this book Woodland draws upon his considerable store of knowledge about the great race to bring us several very interesting, but little-known tales of the experiences of some well-known, and some not-so-well-known riders who have had the honor of suffering in the world's greatest bicycle race.The stories in this book show the human side of the day-to-day struggles of competing in the event, with some of the riders just trying to survive to the day's finish. While some of the tales are funny, and some not, all of them are so interesting that you don't even have to be a fan of the race to really enjoy this book. If you are a fan of the Tour de France (and why wouldn't you be?) then so much the better."
4,"Winning The ""Davis Cup""","Walter Davis' ""Davis Cup"" was first available on CD in the mid 90s as part of the Blue Note Connoisseur Series, but it is now out of print domestically. Now the only way to get this classic Blue Note disc is as a pricey Japanese import. This session is from August 1959 and features Jackie McLean on alto sax, Donald Byrd on trumpet, Sam Jones on bass, Art Taylor on drums, and Davis on piano. This same group (less McLean) cut Donald Byrd's ""Byrd In Hand"" three months earlier, but they are definitely more inspired on this date. The standout tracks are the soulful ""'Snake It,"" ""Loodle-Lot,"" and the rhythmic ""Rhumba Nhumba,"" but unfortunately what stands out the most is the poor sound quality. There is a lot of distortion in this recording that seems on emanate from the drum mics. In any event, it is the reason I can only give ""Davis Cup"" four stars, even though it is a great set."
4,"LowFat, Low-Cost Adventure","With wonderful recipes like Morroccan Beef with Lemon Couscous to Cajun Dirty Rice the choices are varied, a nice change from most ""low cost"" cookbooks. There are many tips on low-cost cooking, many of which can be found in other books, but I enjoyed how this book was organized. All the recipes we have tried from this cookbook have been approved by my picky 3 year old. The reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that many recipes take an a hour or longer to cook. Cooking from scratch is a big cost reducer for the food budget, but can become time consuming. There are cost per serving estimates in the margins next to every recipe, which come pretty close to the mark for what I spend to make the recipe."
3,Commitment,Pretty much the state of the world okay. Two out of three marriages end in divorce. A sad situation and not to be romanticized.
3,Close Relations,"An easy read and quite entertaining, though certainly not gripping. Reasonably average people doing fairly ordinary day to day things, yet it was well presented, with good descriptive characters and surroundings."
4,can't really complain for the price I guess,"The dial gauge itself really is a proper working unit. however, the method used to attach it to the magnetic base is a poor design; the pinch bolt that goes through the dial gauge bracket is much smaller than it should be causing a lot of lost motion(excess play) if the pinch bolt isn't SUPER tight! I will make up a better method to attach the gauge to the bracket in time. the magnetic base is quite strong, and compared to an earlier reviewer who mentioned that it was weak, I don't have any complaints with it other than it should have been sold with a case, but all in all, one can't really complain about this item because it was VERY reasonably priced!"
1,Very nearly worthless,"Dial indicator: It works, but that's the only kind words I can say about it. The unit was either banged around too much in delivery or was just totally uncalibrated from the factory. 0 is around -85 for my unit. Fortunately, the scale can rotate to allow for this.22 piece tips: They fit. They seem sub-Harbor Freight quality, but they fit.The magnetic stand: Total garbage. 176 pounds of holding force? HAHAHA! Try ~2 pounds. It cannot hold up the weight of the unit. It is very easy to pry off a wall, engine, fender, etc. The adjustable arm is awful. Barely useable. The shabbiness of this stand is the whole reason I'm taking the time to write this review. It is laughably awful.Instructions: Totally absent. It's not like it's a hard tool to setup and use, but still. ZERO instructions.Shipping: inside a paper envelope. I don't even mail CDs in a paper envelope.Overall: Horrible. Should have hit my local Harbor Freight up instead."
1,Don't use this on your head!,"Don't -- use this as a hair conditioner. It felt like I dipped my head in a vat of oil. It left my hair extremely greasy, disgusting, and limp.Do -- use this in place of your shaving cream. It works wonders on the bikini stubble!"
1,THIS STUFF IS HORRIBLE,Condition? I couldn't get my brush through my hair. It makes your hair stiff and sticky. Forget blow-drying. It made it impossible to comb or brush and also makes your hair dull. You can rinse for 10 minutes and still not get it all out. I threw it directly in the garbage. I used to be a fan of this company. Not anymore.
4,Interesting oddities make this a good purchase...,"It is sometimes annoying how Paramount manage to repackage Star Trek themes in endless combinations, but it is a testament to the consistency and quality of the composers who have worked on Trek's various TV incarnations that these discs seldom disappoint.This particular disc stands out mainly for the interesting departures from the 'standard' Star Trek themes, namely Nana Visitor's rendition of 'Fever', the B-movie style theme for 'Bride of Chaotica' and the (not very good) lounge version of the original Star Trek theme.At the more conventional end of the spectrum, the excerpts from 'All Good Things' and 'Balance Of Terror' bring back memories of two excellent episodes that most fans will remember fondly."
4,"Well, I've heard some samples...","There's a focus on TOS, with suites from Corbomite Maneuver, Balance of Terror and What are Litle Girls Made Of. TNG has All Good Things (series finale), DS9 has Way of the Warrior and Kira singing Fever, and Voyager has the 1950's sci-fi homage Bride of Chaotica! The opening themes to all series are here, DS9 is Season 4. I'm still researching, but it looks pretty good. VOY got the short end of the stick with Chaotica, not typical Voy music...but you may like that. TOS sounds interesting, and TNG's finale and DS9's ratings stunt sound good from the samples."
4,if you wait long enough...,"Been trying to find the cut for "" In Chapel"" for years. Never imagined in my wildest dreams it would ever be realeased in original form. Now, if I could just get my hands on "" The Sons of Katie Elder"" and ""Von Ryan's Express"" I could die a happy man."
5,History you can dig.,"This is a fantastic history of what's underneath the ground of today's London. Blending history, geography, and engineering, this book describes the smothered streams and covered rivers, the water pipes and sewers, and the tunnels under the Thames.A major section is devoted to the London Underground - the ""Tube"" - and its history. The Post Office's automated mail-handling railway is briefly touched on as well.The role of London's underground spaces during wartime is reviewed including the underground factories and the Cabinet War Rooms of the Second World War.The book is profusely illustrated with a heavy emphasis on contemporary cut-away and explanatory drawings. The pictures make the text come alive.A really great book for the Anglophile or London-buff."
5,"Exellent glasses, certainly for outdoors","I am really very pleased to have purchased these sunglasses. They are ideal for outdoors, very confortable, attach very well, the lenses do not get scratched and it is very easy to change the different set of lenses.I use them for any occasion, not just sports and outdoords. Certainly recommend them."
1,Item is not as pictured!,"I just want to warn everyone who is thinking of purchasing this: the item I received was not the sling bag featured in the picture. It is actually something that looks like the MacCase 15"" MacBook Pro Messenger here on Amazon (which is not a backpack but a true messenger bag). Hopefully Amazon will put up the correct picture soon--I just don't want anyone else to get the wrong item!"
5,Heavy Duty Power Strip,"The tripp lite 20 amp power strips is heavy duty good quality power strip with an extra long and thick guage cable. You won't find many selection out there for a 20amp power strips like this, most of them are just your typical 15 ampps. Be sure you have a 20amp Circuit to plug this into!"
5,Tripp Lite Power Strip,Needed more amps than you can get in a standard power strip for an older apartment to have a microwave and new digital tv w/antenna plugged in at the same time. No more problems.
5,"Rugged jeans, great Amazon service",Delivery was unbelievably fast - even for Amazon! Jeans were as advertised and best price I could find. Well constructed and sized properly. I have found Wrangler jeans to be cut with a bit more room in them - ok with me - AND among the most durable denim I can find.
2,Weak thread,"After one wash and a few days of wear, the rear pocket started to separate from the seat. The waist seemed a bit larger than stated - I have to wear a belt to keep them up, which is something I didn't expect when I ordered them. Otherwise, the fabric and fit is ok."
3,Wranglers,"Great fit comfortable, however a belt loop on two different pair has torn off on one end, hence 3 stars"
1,Size incorrectly labeled,"This obviously isn't a rating of the product itself, but I don't know any other way to do it. Never wore the pants cause they were at least 2 sizes smaller in the waist than labeled so had to send them back. I was very disappointed; I guess mistakes happen, but....No chance that I had wishful thinking about my waist size as I have two other Wrangler Jeans in this size and they fit fine, actually a little loose in the waist. The jeans seemed as advertised otherwise, but again, without actually wearing them, can't say much."
4,Wrangler jeans,"As expected. The fly was a bit wrinkled on the underside...not as smooth as it shoud be. Honey has not complaied, so I don't think it is a big deal."
4,They're good But.........,"I ordered these jeans and they came one day earlier than they should've which was good but.......... they fit like skinny jeans which is a problem because i'm 18 6'4 and 260 lbs. these jeans are not like the rest of my jeans my other jeans are loose fit jeans these are not they're pretty uncomftrable but i'll get used to them,final verdict i ordered these in a size 44 if you plan on ordering these pants and you wear for example 44 get a 46 unless you want skinnys."
2,These used to be good,"These are the jeans I used to love. They used to be rugged, well fit, well made. The last few purchases of these jeans have been very very sub-par. Very thin material. Weak seams. Generally unsuitable for my purposes. If Wrangler wants to maintain the ""Rugged"" label on these jeans, they need to re-think the lousy craftsmanship of recent versions. I know I am shopping around for better jeans."
3,Both Good And Bad,"While the quality of the material was up to my expectations, I was severely disappointed when the button snap on one of the pairs of jeans I ordered flew apart during its first washing, and was beyond repair."
4,A little tight,A little tight compared to casual male and living xl but they do the job just fine. Nice pair of jeans.
5,"Second Triumph with ""Beyond the Second Traffic Light""","With his second volume of poetry Thomas Conroy has achieved reliable excellence. Whether it's Conroy's use of finally crafted personae or candid personal identiity, his poems sing with life. The title poem alone is worth purchasing this book. And they're all that good. There is an intuition at work here that has twin fidelities: one to the physical world Tom inhabits, and one to the universality of mind and spirit. Read ""Rte. 395"" and then ""When the Wizard Comes to Town"" and you'll see what I mean. ""Beyond the Second Traffic Light"" is a fantastic collection from a very versatile and gifted poet."
4,an acient view,this books gives you the sense on how women wee treated and how they made themselves stand out and been heard using special tatics to stop the war between the athenians and the trojans. Although they say that women are the weaker sex the men are weaker with out sex.
4,Gay Hollywood - Like it Really Is,"I had such a great time reading this book - it's fun, salicious, sexy, madcap, satirical, a little surreal, surprisingly touching, and right on the money where gay/showbiz/porn/Hollywood Los Angeles is concerned. Anyone who has spent more than a few days in LA will find a host of familiar characters and situations here, and enjoy/be appalled/laugh out loud/shudder at them all. I suspect there is more than a little ""true life experience"" on these pages, and part of the fun is deciding for yourself just what or what not actually happened to Mr. ""Zimmer"". If even only a 1/3 of the various activities described herein are true, then Mr. Zeffer has had quite a fun life! I look forward to his next book, and will definitely buy it."
3,Poor writing,"I am glad that I saw the movie first, because if I had read this book first, I wouldn't have wattched it. I don't think anyone proof-read this book. There were numerous spelling and grammatical errors."
1,Stereotypes Order Of The Day,"You really can't judge a book by its cover... The quotes by notable gay icons on the cover don't connect to the content of this trite melodramatic ""novel"". The quality of writing in this ""expose"" of the L.A. porn business is very low. The so-called story is filled with a thousand cliches and an insult to gay people. No surprises here as you can see the direction of this tale from a mile away. A big disappointment and another contribution to the public's misconceptions of gay life."
2,Good food! But shipping is TOO pricey!!,"I use this Kaytee brand, Forti-Diet food for my rats, and they actually eat it! I've been through several different brands of rat food, and they have finally settled on this. I feed them 2 or 3 each a day, depending on the size of the nugget, and they're set! I would recommend trying this if you're looking for food for your rat. However, I purchase mine at Target. 2lb bag for 4.99. Although they sell this one for 3.50, the shipping is way too expensive, and you might as well head on over to Target or a pet store to find it. It's pretty common."
5,What a package for the price,I am a aircraft mechanic and use these extension all the time I am very please with there performance and like them a lot 2 thumbs up
2,More like a lesson plan,"This book is ok but not great. It's more of an idea starter, 'get you thinking', type of book. I agree with the other reviewers that, as a teacher, you can read a poem or two in class to get kids started on their own two voice math poems but don't rely on it for correct math or to be a resource for class. There is not enough varied content for that. It's more like a lesson plan that the author has expanded into a short book."
3,Poetry and math?,"This book is a neat way to bring poetry into the math classroom. The math teacher on my team looked at it and chose some to use with our middle school students. (Unfortunately, she felt that some of the math was not correct.) If you're looking for great use of poetic language, this really isn't the book you want. It provides the basic definitions about different mathematic ideas in the form of two voice poems."
5,Fantastic Resource!,"This product is an essential addition to any classroom library (mid-elementary to high school). It is extremely important that students are able to interact with mathematics in multiple ways.

4,Does The Job,"I've been using this product for around one year now and have little to complain. Here is some things to consider, though:' Pros '*It zaps pimples quickly*It's made with organic materials*Works on mild acne, skin irritaions and bug bites too.*It's really convenient. I keep it in my purse and use it 4-7 times daily in between classes and during the day. I LOVE the roll-on part, it's so simple to apply!' Cons '*It does burn a lot. I am 16 years old and it seriously isn't that bad. It lasts for 7 minutes tops and if it burns, it means it is working. :) I find it refreshing.*Strong smell. My friends think it smells really weird but it isn't. It smells like strong spices> I like it.*If you put it on your forehead it WILL RUN INTO YOUR EYES! Not exactly a con but it's liquid so don't get it in your eyes, it stings ;)So buy it? Pass? Up to you but I love it. :)"
1,Their Quality Control is TERRIBLE,"I have used Desert Essence for years and find that they are not consistent in their formulas, but even worse one batch of their lip rescue made my lips burn and peel for days. I woke up with them crusted over, and never received a response from the company. Do not use this product on your face in case it does to you what it did to me."
3,Wonderful but flawed,"First the good news. This album brings together many of the most powerful and enchanting performances by Shirley Bassey and, with forty songs, is excellent value for the money. Tracks like ""Fly me to the Moon"" show off the richness and range of Bassey's voice with wonderful clarity and expansiveness. But, disappointingly, a significant number of the recordings on this CD suffer from very poor sound quality, with Bassey's voice sounding harsh and constricted or distorted on high notes and at high volume. A few tracks are so flawed that tin can and string technology might have been used for the transfer to CD. Hopefully, if this is a problem with the digital source material, the newer ""remix"" CDs will be much better. So, high marks for track selection and value, but points off for sound quality."
1,"Beyond the glossy print, your guide to lame information",I bought this book after reading a glowing review in a magazine. I was disappointed minutes after I turned the first page. Oh sure it has nice glossy print and pretty pictures but content? You won't find it here. You will find all the info in this book and much MORE at recreation.gov. Won't cost you a dime either. My copy gets sold at my next garage sale.
3,"Great concept, enjoyable read, a bit too long","Kellerman has written an enjoyable mystery featuring a young detective named...Will Shakespeare? Yes, it's a surprising adventure with a young Will searching for his mentor's killer, and romancing a lovely young lady named Rebecca Lopez who has problems of her own (she's a secret Jew, in hiding from the Inquisition). You may also notice some interesting similarities to the film ""Shakespeare in Love"" and Kellerman's book came first!While it's a good read, the book does go on a tad too long (a sometime failing of Kellerman's), and the revelation of the killer seems a bit tacked on, as Rebecca's story takes center stage late in the book. Still, this is a very entertaining novel, and well worth a look."
2,Frustrating reading experience....,"While I enjoyed the plot -- I did not care for Faye Kellerman's delivery. Now don't get me wrong - I love a good mystery, good historical fiction, and a good romance, but this book just didn't deliver. Ms. Kellerman's dialogue between our lovers was often overkill and would go on for pages and seemed rather unrealistic. There was no warmth between the characters. I was intrigued enough to get to the end of the story - but the who-done-it answer made me feel like I had wasted a lot of energy looking for the killer in the book. Just a frustrating experience."
2,fiction can be misleading,"Although Literature is fiction, and bearing that fact in mind, I would like to say that Roderigo Lopez (1525-1594) existed (in flesh and bone) and was a physician to Queen Elizabeth I. He was killed under dubious circumstances, after being charged of trying to poison the Queen. NEVERTHELESS, the Doctor was a PORTUGUESE Jew and not Spanish as the novel (eventhough fiction) says or imagines he was. I think History students and readers in general should bear that in mind. Enjoy your reading."
1,Couldn't read it.,"I have just found this author and was enjoying her books, when this one appeared and surely sounded different, I started to read it and couldn't get passed page three. I can not stomach torture, violence etc. Not for me. Had to give it a star, as I couldn't write my opinion."
5,A Quality Read,"An excellent read! Kellerman's detective novels are good, but I think perhaps she has found her true calling in historical fiction. The Quality of Mercy is a fast-paced, enthralling, and diverse novel, switching easily from adventure to intrigue to romance and back again. The characters are absorbing; likable yet very human. By the time the reader has finished following Shakespeare, Rebecca, and co. through their myriad adventures, which follow such timeless themes as fighting, gambling, crossdressing, and prostitution, he will wonder where the six hundred pages have gone. Nothing, though, will prepare him for the cold shock of the ending, which is excellent, but will bring all but the most stoic individuals to tears. This book is highly recommended to anyone with an interest in Faye Kellerman, Shakespeare, Judaism, or historical fiction."
1,Gave up half way through.,"I thoroughly enjoy Shakespeare. This book sounded like it might be an interesting little mystery that involved him.Every once in a while I would get a little thrill of Hamlet, MacBeth, the Merchant of Venice. Was the author going to tie Will's experiences to the writing of these plays? Sadly not.The mysterious death of Will's friend continued to be mysterious with very little plot movement.I found the portrayal of Queen Elizabeth to be deplorable and the author's attempts at Elizabethan bawdiness to be a complete failure. One must leave something to the imagination unless one just wants to write trashy novels."
3,A romance and a mystery,"The Quality of Mercy by Faye Kellerman is a big switch for this author, but I have already read much of her work and was not disappointed. This is not just a crime story, it is a crime story woven within an Elizabethan love story about William Shakespeare and hidden Jewess. The story is interesting and believable and at times, heart wrenching. Shakespeare has left his family and is trying to build a career in London. Rebecca has reached a marriageable age and her life has been planned out by her father with a certainty that makes Will's starving actor existence the polar opposite. There's murder, betrayal and plenty of swashbuckling. All in all a fair read though at times a tad slow."
4,Almost Perfect,"This length of soaker hose will keep the water pressure steady without collapsing towards the end (a problem with the longer hoses in this style). My only criticism is that it is time consuming to set up unless you just go ahead and connect it to the faucet and turn the water on, at which point it becomes firm enough to manuever more easily. Of course this will get you pretty wet. I use it with the holes turned downward as a soaker. It does a thorough job when left in place for several hours, and more frequent surface waterings with a conventional sprinkler are then unnecessary, which is a plus."
3,Sprinker Hose,I remember these hoses from my childhood as being much sturdier. This one is very mushy. It works well enough but I have to repeatedly check it to make sure it is not twisted once I turn on the water. It already has a whole from coming in contact with one of my rose bushes. I wish it was not so flimsy.
1,Bad politics bad policies,This type of thinking degenerates on close analysis. If you get around all of the pseudo erudite lingo you find lurking a pawn for the upper 1 percent. A pawn dedicated to destroying the middle class in america and our republic as we should have it.
2,Don't Buy,This shirt's fabric is stiff and wrinkles like crazy when washed . . . obviously it's a very cheap pique fabric.
2,TOO SMALL!,be sure you order a size bigger as these are not true to size. plus when you first get the item it's kinda scratchy. very unhappy as i bought this to wear for work & i guess i'll just stick with Land's End to buy my uniforms from now on - it's a company that you can trust.
2,Wrinkles,"After washing/drying these shirts, I found that they wrinkle horribly and need to be ironed. Since I wear these daily for work, that is the last thing I wanted in a shirt. Once ironed they look fine."
2,buy a size bigger,"I bought royal blue and color bled. Not comfortable at all,fabric stiff after washing. Tight fit. Not sized correctly,I normally wear large but bought x large. Would not recommend."
2,"Not soft, size wrong","I ordered three polos, size 2xl and they are waaaaay too small.I should have ordered a size or two up.also, these polos are made of very rough material."
3,hanes polo,it's what i asked for it's just not comfortable. i've washed it several times and the material is still very rough.
2,smaller than i xpected!,I bought these for my girls for school they have to wear uniforms. they were made small and not soft.
4,the T-shirt is comfortable,"It's the first time I buy cloth on Amazon.com. The cloth's color is deeper than I expected, but the T-shirt is comfortable while wearing.The delivery is good and in time."
1,WAY too small,"I wish I had read more. I figured Hanes = Quality = No Problems. I am normally an XL, got a 2X because I wanted it loose and comfy for the summer, and it is HORRIBLE. It's TIGHT. It should NOT BE TIGHT."
1,Sizes are GROSSLY misrepresented.,"I ordered this shirt in spite of the reviews which mostly stated that the shirts were far too small. All those reviews were RIGHT. I ordered what is supposedly an adult 3x. I ordered a size larger than usual (I can normally wear a 2x VERY comfortably) to account for the size issues stated by other reviewers. When I received the shirt and tried it on, the fit is more like an adult LARGE. The fabric stretched enough that I COULD wear it, if I chose, but the fit was tight enough I would not choose to EVER wear it in public.I'm not sure where these 'adult' sizes were determined, but no 3x adult I have ever seen would be able to wear a shirt of this size. If you choose to buy this shirt, make sure to order AT LEAST two sizes up. Or, more preferably, look for another shirt to purchase. I am returning mine and really wish I had not paid extra for expedited shipping since I will not get that back in the refund."
1,Only wearing when everything else is dirty.,"Work uniform requires that I wear a polo in royal, navy, or red. This technically fits the bill but it is both too small and way too short. I am normally a 3x but I should have just passed on it. It's too short to tuck in let alone cover my stomach."
2,Your Very Basic guidebook,"... and I emphasize the word ""basic"". Fold-out maps with Chinese characters is helpful, but don't forget to bring a magnifying glass in order to read the maps. Found Time Out Shanghai much much more informative."
2,0ut of date already,"although the good part of this guide was the fact that they gave the chinese characters for all listings, and it's compact size, we found many of the suggestions closed and listings out of date. maybe the next update will be worthwhile"
1,Drained Battery!,"Plugged charger into my phone with 2/3 battery symbol displayed (just needed a full battery for the next day). Left it over night and the next morning, the battery was completely drained. First it turned on and beeped about the low battery, then it turned on and would not turn on at all.I had the same experience as the other customer, that when I tried it again (why?!) my phone would turn on and off and the on, off, and charging animations would freeze."
1,This charger is a cheap piece of worthless junk,"I bought this charger for my Samsung that I just bought from Cingular.The first time I used it in my office, it completely discharged my battery. The second time (dumb me!), it started making my screen flash and the phone to make beeping noises, like it was being shorted out.Threw the thing right in the trash can."
1,Ship Wrong Item,"I bought a Samsung home charger but they sent me a wrong item which is a car charger. I sent email to them and asked what I can do, either send the car charger back and they can send me the right one or they return my money. They sent me email and said they will ship they right one to me right away. However, I have been waited for 3 weeks and see nothing. I can just go out one of the stores and buy it for cheaper price but I believe them for sending me the right one... Why i have to wait.. If they don't send it to me, they can just tell me they can't. They don't have to tell me to wait"
4,Hilarious collection,"While this may not be near the complete collection that the women of Saturday Night Live deserve, what is here is excellent. It contains some real gems, including Debbie Downer at Disney World, Oprah's Favorite Things, and the outstanding classic skit with Jan Hooks and Nora Dunn as two waitresses in a diner with customer Alec Baldwin. The extras are very good including some 'dress sketches' that make you wonder why they didn't make the final live show. The new footage filmed for this collection has most of the women assembled together in the studio to celebrate these sketches and their history. It's a lot of fun.I saw ""The Women of SNL"" when it aired on TV about a year ago and was hoping it would be released on DVD. Very glad to own it now!"
5,Hysterical!!!!,I would recommend this to any SNL fan.. or anybody who loves to laugh! These women are amazing and sooo funny! I watch whenever I need a good laugh. I have seen it tons of times but every time is like the first!! Must have!!
5,Journey to Awakening,"This book is a tremendously important spiritual work! It precipatated a long sought awakening for me.Rev. Jack Poole, Unity of LouisvilleI've shared with our church congregation that this is the best book I have read on HOW to be in communication with God. I couldn't put the book down because it was easy to understand and joyful reading. I liked the clarity in the definitions/expanations of God, Holy Spirit, Jesus, God's Will and Truth.Rev. Susan EngPoole, Unity of Louisville"
5,Their favorite book.,"My 22 month old has demanded we read this book at least once a day for several months now. When my grandchildren, 2 1/2 and 5 1/2, are here we read it over & over. The oldest now has it memorized. The rhythm of the rhyme is fun and they love the bright illustrations. Warning--the repeated readings mean you will memorize it soon as well and it keeps running in your head!"
3,Description was misleading,"The product is fine. The book is in good condition and colors are great. The description however was misleading. I was looking for a board book version as this is one of my son's favorite books. The description said it was a board book but it was only a hard cover, the pages are paper. I kept it because I'm giving it to a friend for a baby shower gift, but I was very disappointed."
5,Absolutely Adorable,My 2.5 year old can finish most pages on her own. She also has learned her alphabet so well - she can point and tell me a half dozen of the letters already! The concept is just wonderful. I definitely recommend this to everyone with children!!
5,Great book and CD for young kids,"This was one of my kids' favorites, especially with the reading by Ray Charles. It is a great rhyming story that helps kids learn letters and is complemented by fun silly pictures. All in all a favorite gift for families with young children."
5,Excelente,Tengo un hijo de 3 años y medio. Hay que leerle Chicka Chicka Boom Boom todos los dias. Excelente para introducirlo al ingles.
5,Classic,Chicka Chicka Boom Boom is a kindergarten classic. This one is nice as it comes with a CD which includes sung versions by Ray Charles.
5,Fun Book and CD,Chicka Chicka Boom Boom is a great rhyme and Ray Charles is great. I had this on cassette and wanted to upgrade to CD for my grandchildren. They love it!
4,Chicka Chicka Boom Boom,My 3 year old son LOVES this book. It is a very fun ABC learning book. Would highly recommend this book to anyone with preschool aged children.
5,so entertaiing,"My grand daughter, age 2 loves this book. It's the 1st one she pulls off the shelf for me to read to her. it's a ""must get""."
5,A great book from a teen who loves it,"I really really enjoyed this book. Not only did it teach the alphabet, but also gave fun to those who read it. When I first read Chika Chika Boom Boom, that saying just stayed in my head forever. I remember I was in science class and that saying just popped in my head. I knew that one day I would need to buy this classic and make sure that I read it to my kids someday."
5,=),"if you dont own this book, you should expecially if you have some youngins. its a great book that captures the minds, with a great little tune, that you'll never get outta your head, even 10 years later after the first time you read it. Its a good thing though i almost assure you."
5,Fun book,This was one of all my grand kids favorite books. Good cadence and repetitive lines that kids look forward to and chime in on. I don't know if it helps with learning the alphabet but it's lots of fun.
2,Too expensive,"Thought there was more, way too expensive for such a short book. No paper, no ink...really? Probably need to reconsider"
5,Two boys' review: Little boys love Chicka Chicka Boom Boom,"This is a regular addition to our bedtime reading collection for our two sons (ages 5 and 4). The book is colorful, fast and fun to read.Both of my kids already know their ABCs but that doesn't prevent them from enjoying this book and giggling like mad as they read these lines:""Skit skat skoodle doot. Flip flop flee...""""mamas and papas and uncles and aunts..."""
5,It's all about the boom,"I taught preschool for years and now have a 6 month old. I have read Chicka Chicka so many times that I can quote it verbatim from the first ""A"" to the last ""Boom"". The thing about this book is how easy it is to make it exciting and fun for the listener. Anyone who teaches knows that reading to kids is almost as much about the acting as it is about the words and the pictures. This book lends itself so easily to sign language, volume changes (BOOM BOOM!), tempo changes, humor, and body movements...if you're not willing to twist yourself ""ally-oop"" like ""O"", you may not grasp its greatness. If you are, your listeners will be hooked on Chicka."
3,alphabet story,Not that great a hit with my grandchildren (ages 3 and 5)Maybe they're spoiled by Dr Seuss more fascinating rhymes.I wouldn't purchase it for a gift.
5,Our favorite book!,"""Skit skat skoodle doot, flip flop flee"" has now become a part of our family vocabulary! My 3-year-old and 2-year-old sons love this book so much, that after checking it out constantly at the library, I'm buying it. My 2-year-old is hard to please when it comes to books--very few of them capture his attention. But this one he wants to read over and over. Also, it's a fun book for the parents to read (and if you have it, trust me, you'll read it 78 times a day) with its fun rhythm and rhyme, reminiscient of Dr. Seuss. You will LOVE this book, and your kids will too!"
2,Didn't capture my 18 month old,This book didn't interest my 18 month old who loves rhyming books. Perhaps when he gets a little but older??
3,Redundant and Overly Lavish for Kindergarteners,"I used this book to tutor for a kindergarten class. The pictures were overly lavish and the theme seemed disjointed. There were more letters on pages making difficult to differentiate letters, sounds, and ideas with students. I especially do not enjoy writing more words to convey a message on Amazon that I have already conveyed--just to make up the quota of words!!!!!"
5,FABULOUS FUN!!!!,"This is a fun and exciting book- my 5 y/o entire kindergarten class LOVES it! We purchased this book with a CD that Ray Charles is reading-- it's SO FUN!!! You cannot go wrong, every kid needs books like this."
5,great CD,"my son is still too little to start learning alphabet, but he loves listening to this CD. it is a wonderful combination of fun words, interesting story and good music. my 18-month-old son could listen to it all the time."
5,I loved this as a child,I remember thoroughly enjoying this book when I was in kindergarten. That was 16 years ago. It's a great book.
4,Great Story albiet Sloppy Editing,"My daughter, Xyzika, loves this book, and that is worth a ton of gold to me and I read this book five times a week. It is colorful, pretty, and mostly snappy.BUT ... YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS ...In the version I have, which must be in the 50th printing by now having been purchased new in 2006, on the last page of the story, the word I'll is spelt I""ll .OH MY GOD!!! I couldn't believe a typo like that in a world-famous, award-winning book.You can read 500-page novels your whole life and not see that, and it couldn't be caught in a 500-word children's rhyme? Two authors, editors, numerous chances to fix it, and it""s still there? Even Microsoft Word's spell checker catches that."
3,Jamberry Rocks!,"I wonder why it took 3 people to ""write"" this book when the ""chicka boom"" is borrowed from an old Van Morrison song, who borrowed it from an old chidren's chant; and the ""illustrations"" are no more than letters cut out from colored paper!"
2,Don't waste your money!,"Don't waste your money. This book had great hype, but it's awful! I wish I had returned it sooner, but I got stuck with it because I was ill following chemo and couldn't get to the post office within 30 days in order to return it~ I bought it as a gift for my grandson, but will probably donate it instead~"
2,Not a fan of this book,I was disappointed with this book. I bought it because of the great reviews it got from Amazon users (5 stars from 90+ users). I wish I spent my money on something else.
2,I don't get it!,"The book starts out ok, one letter at a time. The second half of the alphabet is sort of rushed up the tree. And what is a chicka chika boom boom anyway?"
3,Great book but....,Chicka Chicka Boom Boom is a great book but the one I ordered was missing the last half of the story. The full version goes through the alphabet 2 times and the last page has the whole alphabet upper and lower case. My daughter loves it!!! This one stopped after the letters go up the coconut tree 1 time. The second half of the book is the best part so just make sure you are purchasing the WHOLE version
5,My sons FAVORITE book!,I purchased this book for my son several years ago and we have since had to replace it because we read it so much. Love the book! Definately need to learn the song too!
5,We love it!,"Whether your child is 2 or 5 this is sure to be a household favorite! Great for letter practice or review, great rhyming and eye catching illustrations."
2,"i just dont get it, either!","i am quite amazed to see such rave reviews about this book. it starts off well in a nice sing-song rhythmic way and then suddenly it is so incredibly boring, just runs out of steam. and those cut-out like illustrations, sigh... i'm sorry but i've seen way more imagination from little children."
3,I don't know....,"It's kinda a weird book... I opened it up and started reading it with enthusiasm and pep, and my daughter and I were enjoying reading it but as it progressed I couldnt help but stop and think ""this is a freaking strange book""!! :-\"
2,Better ABC books exist,"This book is reminiscent of the earlier Dr. Seuss ABC book. Both use rhythm, story line, and nonsense words to teach alphabet letters. But Dr. Seuss has an imaginative vignette for each letter and the rhymes are much better. This is one of those books which I expected to like but didn't. As a result, I find it hard to be enthusiastic when reading it to my child."
5,Chicka Chicka Boom Boom,"A classic that never goes out of style. I have barely twos singing chicka chicka boom boom in the classroom, even when we aren't listening to it."
3,Kids LOVE this book,"I am a pre school teacher and I used to be a first grade ELL teacher. I used to go to the school library and take out this book, but my students demanded we have a copy in the classroom. I don't know why but they love this book. I mean, it's funny and entertaining but I still don't understand why they love to hear and read it over and over again! It's not MY favorite but definitely theirs. Which is basically what matters."
4,"A Simple, Pleasant Alphabet Song Book","This book tells a simple, pleasant story of junior members of the alphabet racing up a coconut tree, then falling out when the tree gets too full. The letters are then rescued by their parents, the capital letters. Very rhythmic and fun to listen to for small children, and a wonderful aid to learning the alphabet, although the ""chicka chicka boom boom"" refrain may get old for parents reading aloud. It is illustrated in Lois Ehlert's distinctive collage style. There have been several songs written to supplement the book."
5,"Cute, fun way to present the alphabet!","Our two daughters enjoy this book over and over. It is an excellent way to introduce the alphabet to young children. It shows both cases of the letters in a fun way. It is good visually with the colors and verbally with the rhymes. Our 3 year old loves to repeat some of the phrases of the book; she has them memorized. Learning through play and reading is an excellent way to teach our kids. She loves how the alphabet runs up the tree and has a ""Boom Boom."""
5,My son's favorite book!,"We received this book from a friend at my baby shower. I had never heard of it, but she said her children loved it. My son is 2 now and sure enough this is his current favorite book. He loves that we always start out singing the the ABC song before we read the story. It's really got him excited about the alphabet. I highly recommend this to anyone!"
4,Solving Insomnia,"This CD helped to solve my insomnia problem. There seems to be a problem with the production. Some parts seem softer then others, so it is difficult to hear them without the other parts being too loud. Other then that, I really enjoyed the music and it helped me go to sleep."
3,Simple Electronic & Basic Mechanic Projects for Schools,"This book is pitched at the Grade 10 to 12 student in a secondary school. Unfortunately,this is not clear from the title. The focus is on the electronics side. It does not go into robotics and what ""mechanical"" components shown are very basic.Having said the above the content IS very suitable for the secondary student without getting bogged in the maths of electronics."
2,Box Kit in a book,"I was hoping that this book actually offered more explanation on the design and application of mechatronics. It is basically a book of science fair projects for 12-18 year olds. It offers very little (if any) actual instruction on the components or the reasons why they are used. You will need a pretty good understanding of electronics before you venture into this book. I am going to have to find a good, basic book on electronic components and design before I can venture into this entire series."
2,MEchatronics for the Evil Genius,"Not a bad piece. Goes into the why's and wherefore's of how things work before they crank it up a notch or two.Wasn't exactly what I was looking for, but I managed to glean a few interesting tidbits from it regardless.It will come in hand this summer as I set up some mechatronic projects!"
2,Weak,"Documentary is biased in favor of people who favor Dan Brown's views. Equal time is not afforded to bibilical authorities, historians and other experts. Although, ultimately the outcome refutes Dan Brown's claims, it does so with too much time given to non-authoritative ""experts"" and a disgruntled former Opus Dei member.Recommend Tony Robinsons, ""The Real DaVinci Code"" It does a much better job of balancing the views of true experts with those that are busy getting rich from perpetuating myths, legends and distortions."
2,Mexican Camping?,"There is not much useful in this book. Traveling widely in Mexico and checking out many of the suggested stops, few still exist. Just try calling them. One of the few that was still in operation had an overflowing septic tank and was intolerable.Alas, dry camping with permission is the order of the day. Luckily Mexicans are nice about it. US style RV or tent camping sites are rare as hen's teeth. Since the right to bear arms does not exist in Mexico, security can be a real issue if you make a bad decision. Maybe the best advice, if you do not caravan, would be to drive a decrepit, ratty, small RV so as not to attract the wrong sort."
3,outdated,I didn't realize that this edition was so old. The book's spine was broken and some pages were ragged. It was probably useful ten years ago.
1,review is of lousy kindle sample,never got to body of work. whole sample wasted on intro boring details of how survey was planned and executed and pages of apologies for limitatioms of study. sure made me want to click BUY and dive right in Not. Pity. Title sounded worthy
3,It Doesn't Say 'High Potency' For Nothing!,"The bottle does say, 'High Potency' and that it is. You HAVE to make sure that you really eat. I'm not talking about just a snack or a small meal. You need to really eat. These vitamins are harsh on the stomach. I got rather sick because I didn't eat enough prior to taking the vitamins. It's not the product's fault though. You just have to really eat. I didn't rate it a 3-star due to this incident. I rated it 3-stars because I haven't felt any of the positive effects. I'm taking these pills for energy purposes. Those who know anything about B-Complex, understands that certain B vitamins are geared towards helping your body create energy. I've been taking these for a month now. They are half gone. It is possible that I have to complete the whole bottle, wait a littler longer, before I feel the effects. I will say that I'm not sure if I'll buy these again. I am going to try other B-complex vitamins after I'm done with this bottle."
1,twinlab vitamins and all vitamins on Amazon,"Why doesn't Amazon have the Ingredients label for all the vitamins and supplements? I need to see all ingredients not just B12 and/or just the front cover. I need this to make sure I am not taking too much of one vitamin or supplement. I already take Twinlab Tri-Boron Plus and I need the B vitamins to add to it. Unfortunately I can't buy any of these items because Amazon fails to allow the customer to see, click to enlarge, the ingredient label. I'll have to find it on another site for all my vitamins and supplements."
2,gets stuck in my throat,"I guess the vitamns are ok, but the big capsule it comes in is the kind that gets stuck in the throat too easily. I just about gagged to death this morning (well, not quite that bad) but bad enough so that I'd finally had it! I threw the rest away and will find an easiler to swallow B supplement."
4,B-Complex stress with C,"When the cost of my 'Nature Made' subscription dramatically increased, I looked for an alternative with a high vitamin C count. I decided on TwinLab and am happy with product."
2,Bit of beware,"You clearly see Stess B-Complex Caps. Well look carefully on bottle on right hand bottom it has Vit C in it. I cannot take the acid of Vit C, thus had also ordered Ester C, non acidic. Greatly disappointed when it arrived to find the line under what you can see with any ease is saying VIT C also. I do well admit it was on confirmation of order but had to go back and read for first time. I look at what is on screen to order and seldom look at confirmation as most who order a lot on Amazon. Amazon, LOVE IT!!"
3,I don't like it. Pills too big and you need 2 a day. Never again.,The capsules are way too big and you have to take two a day. I don't like it and will never buy it again.Twin Labs makes top quality products. I won't buy this again because it annoys me. I'm not paying money to be annoyed.I'm going to light a candle for peace now.

1,racial stereotyping is not funny,"My issue is not with anything Tom Robbins wrote, but with narrator Barret Whitener: a white male who opts to read all the dialogue from Japanese characters in a bad, generic ""Asian"" accent. It's unbearable to listen to. In addition, Whitener can't even pronounce the simplest of Japanese words, like ""sake."" How many more years must transpire before an Asian person can have a voice without being mocked?"
2,A Big Disappointment,"I wanted to like this book, but it was a bit too much of a stretch. The characters did not really interest me. To be honest, I didn't finish it."
2,An arrow in the bullseye of a tired target...,"Robbins earlier works are much better and as he continues with his retreaded themes his efforts are becoming increasingly bathetic.Sadly we must acknowledge that even the most dexterous writers and thinkers in our times are, in most cases, one thought wonders.Robbins is only feeding us shadows now; as he has for a number of years.Some will be able to fill in his metaphysical blanks but others who cannot are waitng patiently for a book that will never come. Such are the vagaries and irony of fame and fortune: In the periods of life that we should become the most vicious we actually become the most docile."
2,lite Robbin's snack till his next Big Thing,"Not Tom's best by a long shot (I've read'm all), though I liked it better than Fierce Invalids. This is due more to a prurient self-interest in Japanese mythology, South East Asia, hot Asian women, sex and sake than it is to anything like character and plot. The novel doesn't end, but rather poops out. As a platform for Tom's philosophical whimsy, it offers little he hasn't already said, though I agree with him whole-heartedly. If you're already a fan, read it for Tom's characteristic bubbling prose. Newcomers should start with Skinny Legs, Jitterbug, or Still Life and go from there. Frankly, Tom lost his edge with Frog Pajamas and has been sliding down the slippery slope ever since."
1,Robbins worst (so far),"I can't believe I read this whole book. The first chapter was engaging, funny and had some promise. And then the book just turned into a soapbox. All these ridiculous speeches and crap about ""Lao"" vs ""Laotian"", US foreign policy, Americans, whatever - you name it - and a really ambiguous plot that had us guessing at what the fate was of more than one of the protagonists. Maybe I lack imagination but reading this book made me question why I thought any of his other books were funny or interesting."
4,A fun romp for Robbins' fans,"This is an easy read that goes quickly. It covers themes of Vietnam war, but not really. It kinda reveals that all we did there is not finished. I know it is easy to forget the past -- heck we've already jumped into another Vietnam type war in the same generation. This is not about the war, nor foreigners really. It is about Americans who adapted in an entertaining way to the crazy world the leaders built for them. Expect the usual Robbins zaniness. A fun read."
4,"Good, but not as good as.....","A good novel by Mr. Robbins -- definitely not one of his best (i.e. Jitterbug Perfume, Skinny Legs and All, Fierce Invalids in Hot Climates); but certainly better than the disappointing Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas. Definitely lacking the twisty, understories and linquistic acrobatics of his better books, but interesting and still enlightening."
1,Stupid & Not Funny,"Let me get this straight... this guy has a fanatical cultlike following of readers? Writing this crap? Sixty pages in and I don't care what happens to anybody in this book. The next time I want witty and wacky, I'm going to reread some Douglas Adams."
2,He could have done better,"I think Tom needed money when he cranked this baby out. He doesn't really get you attached to any of the characters. If you are catching an airplane to japan its better then most of the stuff out there. But not his best work, not even close really."
2,Villa Inconsequential,"Tom Robbins latest and slightest of novels opens with a wacky Japanese myth about a randy, big-balled badger with a taste for sex and sake. Fast forward a few hundred years and we pick up the story of circus performers, government agents, drug smuggling and fringe dwellers of all shapes & sizes. Robbins tends to write about nothing and everything simultaneously and sometimes within the same sentence. At times Robbins gets carried away with his thinly veiled PC 101 pontification - heavy doses of bumper sticker philosophy and similes galore. Yet at other times his prose is as lightweight and airy as meringue. These empty literary calories do taste good but unfortunately melt away as quickly as they are ingested and provide nothing of substance or value. A fun but forgettable little diversion. What was that title again?"
3,mystique and intrigue up to the end,"This was not my favorite Robbins title. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great read and I had a lot of trouble putting the book down at times. The ending seemed rushed and undeveloped, it left me flat. However, I loved the orchestration of Asian folklore, rawTanuki behaviors, modern day Southeast Asia and the Circus. These themes alone seemed so much material to explore and develop, that about half way through the book I started thinking the book was already too short. I guess I was spoiled by some of Robbins' other titles. All in all, I'm still glad that I read this book, it is worth the read."
3,"Really good, but not great...","I did enjoy this book, and it was still better than most of the drivel currently being published, but I guess I have really high expectations from Tom Robbins, and this one left me kind of flat. Parts of it were actually predictable, and while his prose still flows sweeter than fine wine, I don't think he left his grapes quite long enough on the vine. Also, there was a tease of a past character popping in for a second - my favourite of all his characters - but alas it was only a tease and left me kind of disappointed as I always like to see old friends. Either which way, if you like Robbins then this book is definitely worth reading, but it's no Woodpecker or Fierce Invalids."
3,"Fun, but little substance","This book was a bit of a disappointment. About two thirds of the way through I realized that, although I was enjoying the read and the trademark Robbins prose, I couldn't have cared less what happened next to any of the characters.I wanted to fall in love with Lisa Ko. I wanted to admire Stubblefield. I wanted to empathize with Goldwire. I wanted to feel SOMETHING for any character but it just didn't happen. Neither the characters nor their stories were developed enough to get me involved.I think there's a good book here somewhere - it just needs to be about 150 pages longer and with something that resembles a climax and a resolution."
2,recommended only for the Tom Robbins completist,"For such a brilliant opening line, the rest of the book is just trampled hot trash. A thin plot with even thinner characters wrapped around... Well, there was no kernel to wrap all that around. A few enjoyable moments in a gracefully short novel but a stain about this author's name."
3,"Not his best, but not bad","_Villa Incognito_ contains much of the visual imagery for which Tom Robbins is famous. Unfortunately, it lacks the beautiful combination of time periods that characterized _Jitterbug Perfume_ or the thought-provoking premise behind _Another Roadside Attraction._ Instead, it follows the bizarre adventures of an unusually anthropomorphized animal bent on exploring sexual encounters with humankind. Half-way through the book, the time period switches to modern day and the lives of three MIA's who decided to continue missing. True, there is a connection between the decades, but the connecting elements are never fully explained. Unlike Robbins' other novels, I was not left with the satisfied feeling of understanding that comes from a well-integrated and well-concluded novel. Still, I enjoyed reading the story, but I was a bit disappointed with the ending."
2,Not his best...,Basically this book is an elaborate defense of promiscuity and hedonism. I have liked his other books in the past (Skinny Legs and All is one of my all-time favorites) but this one didn't have enough insight to adequately place the elements of the story within a greater understanding of the world around us (usually one the greatest things about his writing.)
4,Villa Review,"After reading many reviews from fellow avid Tom Robbins readers I was concerned that I wouldnt like this novel and ran to the bookstore to see for myself. Granted, I do not think this book has all of the qualities I have come to expect; it did not make me laugh as much or impress me with language---but who's to say all of his books should be exactly alike? I think it was still a very good story and I loved the way all of the characters tied into one another-although I do admit I was afraid I would loose track of who was who in the beginning, but it turned out to be a very satisfying read-one which beckoned to me to continue reading it through the day, which in my view, is always a great sign."
3,Where's the beef?,I love Tom Robbins. I became a fan after reading Fierce Invalids. That book left me feeling satisfied. This book left me wondering if I had skipped some pages.
1,"Tom, Grow UP!","Or at least, just GROW! You've been writing the same stuff since Roadside Attraction. At least, in the past, you've appeared to make an effort. But Villa, Tom, Tom, Tom! It's like you never even intended to finish the book. Being outrageous is not the same as being original. Take some time off, reflect on what you've become (yourself thirty years ago), and try again. In the meantime, I recommend to you dear offended review reader, to try some of the newer crop of ""outrageous"" authors out there. Christopher Moore, for example (though not Fluke, that was a let down), try Lamb."
4,"Meet me in Cognito, baby.","Robbins doesn't quite live up to his usual high standards with Villa Incognito, but its still better than Michener. Funny, irreverent, inspiring and mind-blowing, Villa Incognito is a must-read for free-thinkers everywhere."
1,Worst effort from a once good writer,"Hopefully this book is an anomaly for Robbins. I have read all of his previous books and generally liked all of them. However, this book was painful to read and overall really bad (there is no other way to put it - it is a stinker). If you want to read something from Robbins, try one of his earlier books, like Jitterbug Perfume. Even some of his more recent books, like Fierce Invalids or Frog Pajamas are worth reading. Just avoid this one or you will be disappointed."
1,Worst Robbins So Far,"This is Tom Robbins' worst book yet. I have read all of his books and this one isn't even complete. There are unexplored characters and no real plot to follow. Usually the plot of his books start to reveal itself late in the book, which makes me believe that this book was never really finished.Throw this book away, its trash. Pick up any of his other books and you will be much happier."
2,Not up to par,"I'd have to call this Robbins's weakest book.First of all, it was too short. Instead of letting events run their course, he chose to end things rather abruptly and tack on a couple of half-baked epilogues.Secondly, the characters lacked depth. This was partly due to the length of the book. There wasn't time to develop any of them fully, and consequently I didn't get to know them well enough to care about them.Thirdly, the writing wasn't as colorful as it has been in his previous books. There were only a couple of passages that made me chuckle out loud, and very few creative turns of phrase. Most seemed forced.And finally, his other books have always left me with some new perspectives on life. This one was fluff.Rated in general, this book gets 2 stars. Rated against other Tom Robbins books, it gets one."
4,I'm not big on Fantasy,"and sex with animals (even in folklore) makes me a bit squirmy, but Robbins is certainly a clever, entertaining bastard!"
1,Busted Book,"Very sorry he even attempted this tragic demise of his style and talent. Compared to his other tremendous works, I have to wonder why he sent this underdeveloped and wandering screed to press."
1,What a disappointment,"The first Tom Robbins book I read was Fierce Invalids, and really enjoyed that one (Switters is one of my favorite characters). This was my second, and it is such a horrible mess that I am stopping right in the middle. I'll try some of the other titles that are recommended here.pk"
1,What happened???,"For the first time in my life, I has experienced disappointment in a Tom Robbins book. The master who picked up were Richard Brautigan left off, has written something which does not deserve to be called a Tom Robbins book. Villa Incognito is Robbins incognito because Robbins style and wit have never been so totally missing in a work by this author. I don't recognize Villa Incognito as something Robbins would have written. If he writes another book anything like Villa Incognito, I will need to find another favorite author."
4,Enertaining movies,Supplier sent film set early. These are low budget adult movies with OK acting. They are a low level charlies angle's type movie. The plots of each movie are similiar with big busted women going after the bad guy's. Mild nudity throughout movie.
5,"Girls, Guns and G-Strings","Very well done videos. Beautiful locations, beautiful cast members, and plenty of shoot 'em up action throughout the series. Lots of eye candy to keep you interested. A viable alternative to current t.v. programming!"
2,"Girls, Guns and G-Strings: The Andy Sidaris Collection","Andy didn't have 12 films, he had one long one. All the stories were basically the same story, retold over and over again, with most of the same actors appearing in each film, creating more of a 12-part serial. I expected ""G-stings"" as advertised, but was disappointed here, too. The actors could not act and it was too much of a stretch to imagine a handful of bimbos being federal secret agents. The guys were all muscle and no brains either. The plots were weak and merely retold in each film, with the same company, locale and characters featured. All in all, a big disappointment."
1,"Awful, awful, awful! No, really, it sucks.","Unless you have a fetish for washed up playmates and penthouse pets and big fake boobs, or perhaps just a little nostalgia for what passed for wanking inspiration back in the day, I suggest you pass on this crap-fest.Poor acting? Check.Terrible editing? Check.Ridiculous plots? Check.Gratuitous nudity with no point at all in the story arc? Check. Check. Check. But it's not even worth fast-forwarding just to see the tih tays.ZERO STARS (but they require a selection from 1 to 5)"
1,hmmm,"was like 90's soft core porn.every movie had the same bad actors like they were all sequals.i got tired of seeing the same women with over sized boobs.one had huge nostrils.guys in speedos with huge muscles but small packages,no bulge. i would not have bought it had i known it would be the same people.the only hot one was the pizza blonde in return.s.b.every movie was shot at the same location,all same buildings,line dancing.same cars gmc.they used remote control cars as bombs in every flick.fast foreward through most of it, very boring."
1,"Lame, lame, lame,,,,,","Lame, lame, lame,,, save your money for something more worthwhile, like,, uh, like,, warm beer, or, uh, watching a chic-flic with your sister,,,"
1,lame boring,"lame, boring, not sexy, bad acting, not worth the money. Do not waste your time on this movie package as you will be greatly disappointed."
1,WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I AM ASSUMING THIS DVD SET IS JUST LIKE THE OTHER ONE MILL CREEK RECENTLY RELEASED (DANGEROUS BABES) WHICH CONSIST OF THREE UNMOUNTED DVD'S THROWN INTO CHEAP PAPER ENVELOPES THAT DAMAGE THE DVD'S. MINE WERE SO SCRATCHED IT LOOKED LIKE THEY HAD BEEN WIPED WITH SAND PAPER. STAND TOGETHER AND BOYCOTT MILL CREEK UNTIL THEY IMPROVE THEIR STANDARDS!
5,"Wow!! Andy really knows how to make a 12 exciting, action packed, hot babes movies.","Let me just say that these 12 collection movies for the price of less than 10 bucks is just unbelievable. I just recieved my movies 2 days ago, and i cant stop watching them. BABES, BOMBS, BULLETS, is the perfect combination for FUN, ENTERTAINMENT movies. U must have this in your collection. if u dont have it yet then i suggest u get them right now. Trust me you'll get your moneys worth. I gave this a 5 stars rating for the price, fun, entertaining movies with a lot of babes and boobies. R.I.P Andy, and Thank you for making all these movies."
3,very exciting and entertaining,"Perhaps it is a movie about beautiful women, but the infusion of some action involving fancy weapons and dangerous criminals overshadowed the porn aspect. i enjoyed it."
3,I watched most of one movie...,"The acting was bad. The plot was a little below decent. There were lots of hot chicks. Overall the script wasn't particularly good either.Good bang for the buck I think given how many movies come in this for a low price.And, as I said, I've only watched most of one movie. There are eleven more movies here. Though I don't expect them to be any better."
4,hot mamas,"adventures of two flying women who stop different crimes while undercover for paramilitary government group. these are no nonsense women who can whip all the bad""boys"" that get in the way along the way."
2,Except for the first film it's the same movie over and over,"This ranking probably won't fit with aficionados of this specific film maker.The first movie was funny and campy.The rest seemed to be indistinguishable from each other.I apologize to those who love these films, but I think it may be an acquired taste. Because of that and the first movie, I'm rating it at 2 stars instead on 1."
5,Love Andy Sidaris movies.,"If you have never seen a Andy Sidaris movie then this is the Mother Lode. 12 movies that are action packed with beautiful women (he loves using ex-Playmates)guns, fast cars, explosions, etc. The acting is so-so, but who cares? It's a visual treat for an amazing low price."
4,great movie,Great to watch-fun comedy. Lot's of G-strings own older chicks. I really loved this movie. Would reccomend it. Fun to watch-lot's of action.
5,I LOVE TO WATCH MOVIES,You never see these movies on regular TV and if you do it is all cut to hell and has a ton of ads going on every five minutes. I love these hot chicks too.
4,Eye candy,Don't expect a great plot. It's pretty much what the title says. Packing is cheap but that's what you get for the price.
5,"When it comes to bad movies, these are some of the best.","Low budget, bad acting and more nudity that not, Girls, Guns and G-Strings gathers together 12 Andy Sidaris films in one inexpensive package. It's amazing that even with all their flaws they are actually more coherent than most Michael Bay films! If you want some mindless fun, or for some odd reason are obsessed with Eric Estrada, these films are great. The only side effect is, I might be a bit dumber for watching them. :)"
4,Staggering Value of Vintage T&A!,"Film-maker Andy Sidaris is a sort of B Movie schlock-meister in the tradition of Russ Meyers who realizes that no matter what the plotline it all works better if there is a hefty helping of gorgeous girls in skimpy clothing liberally scattered throughout. While not of exceptional quality on their own - these James Bond-esque actioneers do move right along - and a package like this that presents 12 movies for the price of one is hard to find fault with. This set gives you all the blazing guns, exploding cars, and X-Playboy centerfolds turned wannabe actress that you could ask for. One heck of a deal!"
5,"Guns,Girls& G Strings dvd",This is my kind of action movies with plenty of scenery it's very easy on the eyes!! Everyone should own this dvd.
1,Awful,"I recently began an online Greek course offered by Concordia Theological Seminary. The course mandates the use of Voelz' Third Edition, but I've found it unusable. It appears to be Voelz' lecture outlines repackaged as a ""grammer"". Because of its true nature, it lacks much of the explantory information needed by students to learn the language. This forced me to spend hours of frustration trying to decipher Voelz' bizarre rules and notes. Those were hours I could have used to learn the language, or better yet, spend with my wife and kids. So I've given up on Voelz and am now using Mounce's Basics of Biblical Greek which I highly recommend."
1,A grammar with a lot of errors,"This Greek grammar by James Voelz is not a complete disappointment, yet when reading it (the 2nd ""corrected"" edition even!) one will soon find printing and spelling errors in the English! There is even one page where there are three spelling errors in the English. Such carelessness in editing takes away from my confidence level in learning Greek from this grammar. How many errors in the Greek are there? Buy Mounce's Basics of Biblical Greek instead. Overall it is better anyway."
3,Brilliant (when in the presence of the author),"I am just completing my Elementary Greek course at Concordia Seminary - St. Louis taught by Dr. Voelz. I must admit that when I looked at the book before class I found it confusing, difficult, and completely unhelpful, however, now, after spending nine weeks with it and its author, I find it an amazing resource that I will use for years to come. When combined with Voelz brilliant classroom technique (I praise God daily that he has a humorous, energetic, and multi-dimensional style) that he has been perfecting for the past 26 years the confusion of a straight read disappears and the book seems to come straight from heaven. While there are some improvements to make in later editions (like teaching aspect from the beginning), I'd say this one is a 1 star on its own and a 5 with Voelz."
1,does not work,Very weak and ineffective compared to other products on this sight that are less expensive.
1,No change,"There's been no change since taking this product. Either it doesn't work or it doesn't work for me.Ogoplex-Berkley Orgasm Enhancer Pills, 30ct"
1,Waste of money,"Absolutely worthless! The supplement does not provided enhancement in any way. You do more for yourself and your partner if you drink a cup of coffee.It is composed of a ""proprietary blend"" and 25% of Vitamin A & E. Unless you are having sexual problems as a result of extreme vitamin deficiencies, this product will do nothing for you.Furthermore, I am suspicious of the positive postings for these pills. I wouldn't put it past the manufactures to post positive ratings in an attempt to generate sales."
5,Enhance is for real!,"This product does just what it claims. If you try it, you willnot be disappointed."
5,The Best,"I,ve used this product for a long time and it is amazing. I also believe it is probrobly the safest product. It's best to abstain from any sexual activity for as long as possible and take this every day.I double the dose and take with an L-argine product. Ejaculoid seems to be effective but i've only used a couple of times and am also not sure what some of the other ingriedients are. Ogoplex contains only flower pollen vit A, E.Beware of some dealers singing you up for automatic reorder!,Like Berkley"
3,Track List,"What about a track list? I would like to see what's on it before I buy it; then maybe I can review it. I gave it 3 stars, site unseen - just based on Jessi's past performances.Thanks."
3,Partition,"je suis un fan de Jessi Colter ,et je ne trouves pas les paroles des chanson suivante,you hung the moon,,,life turned her that wax,,Hold back the tears ,,it S not easy j'aimerais si ses possibles avoir les paroles ,,ses chansons sont tous tres belle,merci ,,,,,,,,,Jules,,,,,,,,,,"
5,Yuppy Puppy Food and Treat Machine,"My dogs have to work for their dry food, end up they lost weight because each press only few drops come out and they take longer time to finish the food. Remember don't put too full just put what they need. It is a fun Treat Machine, I enjoy very mush to watch them, especially when taught them to get food from the machine. One of my dogs press the machine each time he pass by, he is not taking the food, just loves to play--so cute."
5,my girls love it!,"My dobermans love Yuppy Puppy. The enclosed pamphlet says it can take up to two weeks for your dog to learn how to work it, but that is probably an exaggeration as food is a great motivator. One of my dogs learned how to use it in under five minutes, using her paw, the other took about a day and prefers to use her snout to depress the lever. I tried to teach her with her paw but she learned her own way to do it. It is cute to watch them and is much anticipated when I say ""Work the Machine!"" Product is built sturdy for heavy use by mongrels and stays in place well. Doesn't tip over. Highly recommended."
3,key parts are cheap plastic,"Yes, the dog loves it...loves it to death! When the gumball machine is broken and you're back to using the tippy Kong, you discover that you can buy another plastic part for the gumball machine, but do you? Only if you want to reward cheap shortcuts by the supplier."
3,Light quick reading,"I liked it. It was a little too short to really ""flesh out"" the characters. I would buy her books again."
5,The Fine Line - Wayne Watson,This has been my very favorite Wayne Watson CD. It is powerful and challenging. If you are interested in Christian growth this CD will make you think and reevaluate yourself. It sets a standard to live up to and it's great to listen to as well. I loved it.
1,"Very Powerful, But Caused A Reaction","This is a very powerful deodorant, and certainly does the job it was designed to do. Unfortunately, it also caused an adverse reaction for me, as I broke out the first day I used it. I subsequently used it for a couple of days and lived with the resulting rash, but stopped using it as soon as I could get a replacement (and the rash disappeared within a day, so I deduced a cause and effect relationship).If you don't have an adverse reaction from this product, it actually does work quite well and smells pleasant. I obviously can't recommend this product based on my experience, although others may have more favorable reactions than I did."
4,Good buy!,"Dual density construction. Cost is very low so life of product will not be an issue. I expect to cut pieces to length. The package I rec'd was sealed but did not include the end plugs; hence, 4-stars."
5,good,"good grips, very comfortable, and they arived at my house days before i was expecting them. i am very satisfied."
4,Slick interface,"Lots of games, nice graphics. Would be better if keyboard commands could be used in lieu of mouse, it would speed the game up. This does not have a module to train for card counting."
5,3000 degrees,A true story that layman can relate to and one thats gives most firefighters cold chills because they know it can always happen anywhere the job is done.
4,Captivating,"This tragedy is one that I use as an example when I teach firefighter survival courses, it is a great look into the fire service mentality and brotherhood."
2,An okay language learning product,"Dutch is an interesting language, and this Language/30 product is not bad. It could be better, though. I have learned from this program, but it is not the only source that I rely on. Two native speakers recite the language--a man and a woman. The man's voice is not well suited to language learning because he has a deep voice and does not speak clearly. The woman's voice is fine, though--it is higher and clear. The sounds are the essential part of the language, and it would have been better had both speakers not spoken so fast. A facet of this program that is helpful is that the target phrases are spoken twice. The book that comes with the two cassettes contains a section that consists of three pages of basic Dutch grammar. This Language/30 product does not provide the basics of the language, but I still use it and consider it to have some merit. It has given me an idea of what the Dutch language is like. Actually, I rate it 2.5 stars."
1,Useless Anchor,"This screw anchor was touted to me as a solution to hold my jet ski at anchor in shallow water, but here's the problems with this system:A) The screw that goes into the sand is only 12"" long, It never 'bit' properly, needs to be 22"" at least.B) Both hooks are plastic, so attaching to the Ski eye, after a couple gentle waves hit, broke the first hook, I then tied the rope to the ""screw' part, and used the other plastic hook to the ski eye, and less than 30 min later, it broke also.This system is perfectly suited to hold a kayak, in shallow water, on a lake with no wave action going on. It would not hold a 2009 Sea Doo GTI jet ski, in 4'of water off Panama City beach, with gentle, rolling waves. A total waste of money!"
4,Interesting with some repetition,"I enjoyed reading this group of short stories about the original meetings of various characters in the Enderverse. Some of the stories give a bit of insight into characters that weren't previously revealed. My only gripe, and it's a small one,is that if you already have read the other books in the series some of these stories are either a retelling or are verbatim the same. Of course, if you're a fan, rereading those is like visiting an old friend."
3,Quick read. A few interesting tidbits of backstory,"Each short story is.....short. The cost is barely worth it, but, like my title says, a few good tidbits of backstory."
5,Wonderful Addition,"A great companion piece to the Ender Universe. Describes how humanity meets the deadly bugger force, and gives Card's epic series a brand new path to follow. Written in a style similar to Ender's Game over other books in the series, it is easy to burn through, but worth the time it takes."
5,excellent story teller,"Card is an excellent story teller. Once I start reading one of his books, I don't want to stop. My son started me with Enders Game and I have read all of the Ender series, Alvin series and several other books by Card. My wife has read the Ender series and is beginning the Alvin series. We have not been disappointed with any of them. I look forward to reading the Ender series a third time."
3,Fine for tweens/teens,"I bought this for my husband and read it, too, wanting to find out more about Ender's family background. While I really enjoyed the first story about his parents, the rest of the stories seemed disappointing and almost shallow. It just wasn't the story line calliber that I'd expected."
4,First Meetings,Greater elaboration of the characters and situations that play in the series of Ender books.
3,Disappointed Again,"This is not as bad as War of Gifts, but it is not the great either. I love the Ender Game series, it has such depth and intelligent dialogue, but this book just seemed to be made rather quickly so it can make money(with the Ender branding).In truth it added very little to the Ender Universe, except for the last story(""Investment Counselor""), that was the best one out of them all.All in all unless your a die heart fan, this is a waste of time, but I am all for reading books instead of watching TV."
2,First Meetings Deserves Second Thoughts on Artwork,"This collection of Card's short fiction fills some gaps in Andrew Wiggin's background. The stories aren't bad, though Card clearly improved at his craft in the years between writing these stories and the Ender novels. Still, it's always interesting to read an early short piece that inspired a later novel you love. The First Meetings artwork, however, is a serious problem that detracts from the work as a whole. It looks like something from a grade B or C comic book; it's so far beneath the quality of Card's writing (even his early writing)that you have to wonder: what WERE they thinking? The book's illustrations are jarringly bad - so much so they undermine readers' enjoyment."
3,Love the Ender universe,I must say I can not say I enjoyed this book. I hate short stories! They all end right as your getting into them. However fans of the Ender universe that can stand short stories should enjoy this book as all the shorts where well written.I recommend this book only to those who enjoy short stories.
3,Juvenile fiction that's passable for Ender's universe,"A collection of short stories set around characters in Ender's universe. Card couldn't think of enough new material, so he ""Reader's Digested"" the original novel to have enough pages to print. Some of the other stories are interesting, but nothing really above average. It's an ok addition to round out a bit more of a picture of that universe, but nothing special."
1,want more!,"Orson Scott books, especially the Ender's series always leaves me wanting more. I like how the Tarantino-esque approach he takes...which leads me to go back and read the other books."
1,Looney tunes!!,"This is the most disturbed writer around today. He must be off his medications, because no sane person would believe the tripe he has written. Save you money. This is a pathetic excuse for fiction!"
4,Love OSC - Liked First Meetings,"As a huge fan of OSC, I wait eagerly for his next book to come out. However, this one was disappointing on a couple of levels. First, it is really short. I read it in two hours, tops. Secondly (but related to the first) the stories were too short to allow the characters to flex and move, as they do in his other works. I wanted more about John Paul as a child, meeting Theresa, and definately more about the introduction of Jane. (That part still has me confussed.) Card is a master storyteller, no doubt. And while this offering is good (enough), it is not his best work. I would love to see this book ""recalled"" and beefed up.Nevertheless, I give it four stars because the characters remain true to themselves. The text creates a believable backstory to Ender and the puppet-like control the government has over him and his family."
5,four great stories from one great author,"For those of you who have not read any of Orson Scott Card's Ender series, then I must honestly say you are missing out. First Meetings is the perfect book for a simple introduction into Ender's world, so why not start there. This book, like his other Ender books, is just amazingly well written. For example, OSC presents a semi-futuristic world, yet we can all relate and just enjoy reading about the characters; that is not an easy task. It does help that this book is more than just a book. It is really a collection of his Ender short stories, including the one that started it all. For any Ender fan, this is an obvious book to add to the collection, but for the casual reader it presents stories about child geniuses, space wars, and even family. It is a very enjoyable book, and if you like this, and I think you will, then you should definitely read the series."
3,It's okay...,"...since I got it for 1 USD. I would have been interested in seeing a novel about Ender's parents in their formative years instead, but this added some insight."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"A collection that basically does as advertised, although the 'Ender's Game' original novella is to be found here, too.Meetings of Ender';s dad as a kid, his parents when they are university students, and Ender and his AI assistant.Battle School strategy surprise.4 out of 5AI accountants are cool.4 out of 5Young ancestor deal, breeding side-effects rather useful.3 out of 5Smart people meeting.3 out of 53.5 out of 5"
4,"Great stories, poor drawings","This book seems to be aimed at younger readings; at least, I think this due to the childish nature of the artwork. It is the kind of drawing often cluttering up bad books for kids. That's too bad, as it may give readers the idea that these stories are juvenile when they are not. I would note, too, that the artist seems not to have read the stories very well, as characters often look far too young or too old.That noted, for a real fan of the Ender Universe, these are excellent stories to have. Simply to own the original short story which started it all is a nice treat.The Ender stories clearly rank among the greatest series in science fiction."
4,This author writes better short than long.,"I read the original novella ""Ender's Game"" around the time it first came out, and always considered it one of the great classic SF stories. When my kids started reading the Ender books, I assumed I'd read the novel, but it turned out I hadn't, so I read the novel, plus most of the sequels (including the nearly interminable ""Xenocide""). Rereading the original novella in this charming anthology, I still maintain that it is a great work of science fiction, far better than the novel based on it. This author writes well short. He lets the reader fill in the blanks.The pictures in this anthology are hilarious - and telling! They may be trying to imitate manga, but what they actually do, with their jutting jaws and crewcuts, is underline the 1950's boy's SF tradition that Card carries on from the Heinlein juveniles. Yes, Ender's Game is basically a slightly later version of Space Cadet and Starship Troopers!"
2,Flimsy,"The grass catcher is not the one I would have purchased if I had seen it first. It is flimsy, and tilts in such a manner that about half of the grass collected falls back onto the grass. With a rake and this catcher one might be able to get 75% of the clippings, but it is not a very good product. Also, the snap on mechanism that connects the catcher to the mower is always slipping off, which makes keeping the clippings in the catcher that much more difficult. If one has this catcher it might be wiser to mow every three to four days. That way you won't have to use it."
1,As bad as everyone says . . .,"Despite the negative reviews of this, I bought it for my 20"" Scott push mower. I assumed that the problem was that the grass clippings just weren't well directed into the catcher. I have a heavy duty canvas sewing setup, and I thought I might modify the catcher to avoid the issue. But that isn't really the issue at all. The grass clippings simply don't propel back far enough to get into the catcher. Nothing I can do about that by modifying the catcher. So I used it twice and stopped. Leaving the grass clippings on the lawn is actually good for it, but it means that the dogs (and people) track some of them into the house. I try to minimize that problem by mowing the lawn more frequently to keep them as short as possible, so that the clippings drop down deep into te lawn. Sure would be nice, though, if some kind of catcher worked on these otherwise great mowers."
1,wrong size,I ordered this in conjunction with a mower (2 for 1). It didn't fit. I'm out the whole cost plus shipping expenses to send it back.
3,Works with modifications,"I have an American Lawn Mower Reel type 16"" wide. The catcher fits just fine but it is only sits on prongs. When you back up it comes off sometimes -- very annoying. I got a couple of clips and put the clips on the catcher by where it sits on the prongs. This keeps it from coming off. With this modification it works fine."
2,The question to ask yourself is do you really need it?,"I purchased the grass catcher only because I was surprised it wasn't included with the 20"" Scott's push reel mower I purchased. Attaches easily, but like others, found that it ""dumped"" most of the grass whenever I pulled back on the mower. (Problem is that the bottom is made of a semi-rigid plastic; a firmer material might have prevented this issue.) Also, not sure how much grass it really ""catches"" anyway; much of the clippings still fell into the grass or were tossed overboard when I pushed too fast. Since reel mowers -- push or gasoline powered -- work best when the grass isn't too long, I would argue you could live without this attachment if you mow your grass at least once a week or more."
2,UNIVERSAL GRASS CATCHER,"SINCE I HAVE A MUCH SMALLER LAWN AREA NOW I BOUGHT A PUSH MOWER AND EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A MAJOR BRAND, I COULDN'T FIND A CATCHER FOR IT. WAS THRILLED TO SEE THAT TARGET HAD ONE. I STILL HAVEN'T USED IT BECAUSE I NEED TO BUY SOME NUTS AND BOLTS TO ATTACH IT TO MY MOWER. WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO KNOW THIS SO I WOULD HAVE HAD THEM ON HAND BEFORE I RECEIVED THE CATCHER."
1,NOT RECEIVED,"THIS ITEM WAS BACKORDERED. I CANCELLED BECAUSE WHEN IT WOULD BE AVAILABLE, THE GRASS CUTTING SEASON WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER. I WILL NEVER ORDER ANYTHING ELSE FROM THIS SUPPLIER. THEY DID NOT EVEN NOTIFY ME OF THE DELAY IN SHIPPING UNTILL I HAD CALLED THEM SEVERAL TIMES AFTER THE DATE DELIVERY WAS PROMISED."
2,I wish there were competition...,"This thing is a piece of junk. Hard to put on, easy to fall off. It misses 30-40% of the grass thrown at it. Most of the remaining grass piles up on the mower reel. I have a _tiny_ lawn, and i had to stop 3-4 times to re-attach this bag.This thing needs a serious redesign, start with the attachment clips..."
2,"Useable...I suppose.,","I purchased this grass catcher to use with my new Scotts Classic 20"" reel mower. The mower's great. The catcher isn't. The fit is...well...iffy. It snaps easily enough on the bar above the rear roller assembly, where it awaits the most inopportune moment to detach itself. I've found the best way to counter this is to lift up on the handle when pulling back on the mower, thereby avoiding telescoping the grass catcher (and dumping the cuttings back on your lawn). However, the mower cannot be pushed with the handle raised even slightly or the clippings will spill forward out of the catcher. Also, on every path or so it's necessary to reach down behind the blades and sweep the grass toward the back of the catcher: otherwise there isn't enough room for the next batch.I guess this thing will have to do, as I have yet to locate a better device. But I'm looking."
1,ALL BUT WORTHLESS,"I'm a pretty handy guy and I could not figure out how to properly install this ""universal"" catch...probably because it's simply not a good fit even when installed to specifications. Why Scott's brand would allow such a generic ""piece"" to be associated with their product and brand name is beyond me. Unless you know how to weld the included hardware to the rear cross-member (and I certainly do not), I find this catch to be totally worthless...if you're like me, you knew you were in trouble when the assembly instructions didn't even offer assembly for a 20 inch mower."
1,Do NOT Buy It!,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.The bag does not stay on the mower and is too narrow for the mower even if it did stay put.
3,Why did I get this?,I have used power mowers all the time so this is my first time with a reel mower. The mower is GREAT! The basket is almost useless. The grass accumulates to one side and mostly falls out. Its effeciency is about 50%. I Am now mowing my lawn on a weekly basis and alost don't need the catcher. The mower cuts the grass so fine it will surely turn to mulch quickly. I have no problem with the seller. The item arrived in record time and was exactly as described. I just don't see the need for it.
1,DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT,I read all the negative reviews but decided to take a chance anyway.DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!It is absolutely WORTHLESS! I have an American Lawn Mower reel mower and it is great...this is quite the opposite...it is hard to find the proper words to convey just how useless this contraption is.DO NOT BUY!!!!
1,useless grass catcher,I received the reel mower grass catcher in new condition. However when I tried to install it on my reel mower it was in the wrong size and doesn't fit on the mower. I am very dissatisfied with this product.
1,Ineffective grass catcher,I installed the grass catcher as noted in the directions setting it to the far left and it still does not collect 80% of the clippings. Poor design. Requested a return as defective.
1,Not worth the money.,This product is not worth the money. It's very hard to attach and falls apart and you are moving across the lawn.
4,Works,"I needed a catcher for my new reel mower and this works fine. It's light, easy to use and works. It use to bow up when I pulled the mower backwards but for some reason, does't do that any more."
1,This sucks!,This item does not fit the mower it was supposed to. I have doubts that it fits anything. What do you want for something made in China. I wish I'd known that before hand.
2,Disappointed,"this was a disappointment. I does hold some of the grass, but not enough and it pops off too easily in the middle of mowing spilling the grass. The gap between the blades and catcher is too large and allows grass clippings to escape."
1,Junk,"This Chinese-made lawn mower grass catcher is a complete waste of money. Poorly designed and with instructions that must have been written and illustrated by the Chinese Helen Keller, it is garbage. The ""instructions"" ask that you crimp one piece of metal closed over another. Well why not just forge a new one instead at your local steel mill? The illustrations are so badly drawn they are impossible to understand. The grass catcher when finally assembled - by no help of the instructions - is a sloppy fit to the lawn mower. The flimsy construction does not help either. What a disaster. I would be better off taping a plastic bag to the lawn mower - or my knees...A waste of money. Don't do it!"
3,Barely gets the job done,"Unfortunately, I couldn't find any other universal grass catchers for manual mowers so I bought this one. I didn't expect much and so wasn't very dissatisfied. It's catches about 50% of the grass and is very flimsy. I use it to only catch the grass in my backyard (which is where my compost bin is located) so that I don't have to mess with it in my front yard."
2,generic bagger,"The bagger was obviously not engineered for the mower I bought. It catches about half of the grass, and then dumps it out as you go down an incline. Unless you mow super fast, the clippings don't make it very far into the catcher. I wouldn't buy it again if I could do it over."
1,What a P.O.S!!!,"Seriously folks, I agree with most others here that this thing is worthless. Just like many others here, I struggled to attach this to my reel mower (16-in Task Force from Lowes). Even if it had attached easily, it still would not be worth $20 because (in my opinion, from my experience) a bag and a reel mower don't work well together. Some here say that it will catch 75%, I'd say it will catch 5%, really that bad. People are saying that the reel will cut the grass and throw it out the left side, but for me it just goes up and practically everywhere so I've given up on the whole idea of a catcher and rake afterwards. JonathanS"
3,Reel Mower Catcher by American Lawn Mower Co,Looks sturdy but having problems connecting it to lawn mower. Instructions are very poor for this connection.
1,Not very well built reel mower grass catcher,This grass catcher is not solidly built nor does it fit all sizes of reel mowers. My mower is 18 inches and it did not fit. The bottom is plastic. The sides do not stay up well. I'd consider just mowing the lawn without a grass catcher and see if that works for you.
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!,"I read the bad reviews and didn't believe them. I thought, ""Well, how bad can it be?"" Pretty bad. Most of the grass doesn't actually make it into the bag, and what does make it falls out. What DOES make it is just a couple of quarts worth of grass.I've used this once and I'm returning it in the morning."
1,One Too Many Stars,"This catcher should NEVER be sold together with the Scotts 20"" Mower. THEY DON'T FIT TOGETHER!!! Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for even pairing these two. I will get my money back, don't waste yours.The catchers design is good, just doesn't fit."
3,Reel Mower Grass Catcher,"It picks up leaves and twigs as advertised, but very hard to push unless the ground is completely level. Too difficult to take off the catcher to empty, so you have to scoop out the catcher by hand - time consuming and hard on the back."
2,Just barely better than raking.,"Reel mowers have been around for quite a while and it baffles me to no end why there is still not a decent grass catcher for this ""classic"" lawn mower. Just a small wind from behind or a small amount of grass collected along the forward portion of the catcher ensures that you have to continually stop and manually redirect the grass to the rear of the bin or plan on raking.Installing the catcher to the bar is a chore each and every time unless you store the catcher on the rear of the mower. That increases the amount of storage space you will need by not a small amount.I've done my bit for the environment this year, but next year may bring the ear plugs and a gas engine back into my yard. Reel lawn mowers are real pains."
2,Useable...I suppose.,"I purchased this grass catcher to use with my new Scotts Classic 20"" reel mower. The mower's great. The catcher isn't. The fit is...well...iffy. It snaps easily enough on the bar above the rear roller assembly, where it awaits the inopportune moment to detach itself. I've found the best way to counter this is to lift up on the handle when pulling back on the mower, thereby avoiding telescoping the grass catcher (and dumping the cuttings back on your lawn). However, the mower cannot be pushed with the handle raised even slightly or the clippings will spill forward out of the catcher. Also, on every path or so it's necessary to reach down behind the blades and sweep the grass toward the back of the catcher: otherwise there isn't enough room for the next batch.I guess this thing will have to do, as I have yet to locate a better device. But I'm looking."
1,You should leave your grass clippings where they fall anyway,So the silly thing doesn't stay on and besides that I have now learned that it is much better for your lawn if you just let the clippings lay. This means you can't let your lawn get really long or you might end up matting it. But if you are using a reel mower anyway you wouldn't want your lawn to get long. Moral of the story. . . leave the organic matter where it should be and out of the landfills.
2,Better than nothing,"I purchased this item to fit a Scott's 20"" mower. The item discription said this was the catcher to fit this particular mower. It does fit, however it is about 4-5"" to narrow, not the full 20"" wide. It was easy to unpackage and start catching immediately. The back of the catcher is supported by a metal arm that is sewn to the bottom of the catcher. During the first use this came loose and I had to rework it to continue use. I'm still using it and it's better than nothing at all, but I was diaappointed in the size and quality."
1,grass catcher review,This grass catcher hardly catches any grass when you have the blade at the highest setting. The catcher will buckle and dump any grass that it has caught if you try to back up. I think it is a waste of money.
2,Shotty Wokrmanship,"After one use, seams started failing. Is repairable, however sort of a pain to keep repairing after every-other use. Would suggest finding something of higher quality."
1,Bagger for reel mower,"I was not impressed with this at all. It said universal for up to 20"" mower. This bagger does not come close to working with my 20"" mower. I have to pick a side to use. It is easy to hook up but does not catch very much grass. Before buying this watch your grass cutting. If most if flying over the front of the mower than a bagger will be of no use. If I had to do it over again I would not waste my time buying this bagger that catches about 20% of the grass."
4,The catch is fine,"It's a bit smaller than my 20"" mower but it works fine.I used cable ties to fasten the loose parts. The assemble process isn't straightforward but it's not rocket science either.The catcher needs to be emptied once in a while but it's not end of the world. It's perfect for a small yard (< 2000 SF).After all, it provides another way of exercise."
3,Works Well Enough,"After reading the other reviews I was a little hesitant to buy this item, but I really wanted a catcher for my Scotts 20"" mower.The good news is that this catcher can be made to work pretty well. It's too narrow for a 20"" mower (it would probably be perfect for a 16""), but I found that when I was mowing the grass tended to get kicked to the left side. I just made sure that the catcher was on the left side.The key to getting this to work was to use nylon zip ties. I tossed the two metal hooks that came with it and used 4 zip ties to attach the front edge of the catcher to the rear cross rod of the mower. I used one more to tie the left vertical support bar of the catcher to the left side of the mower.Attached this way the catcher never came off in over an hour of mowing.I did notice that when I hit a particularly long patch of grass some of the clipped blades would fly over the catcher, but not too many."
2,Push reel mower grass catch bag,"This was the one for my 21"" Scott's push reel mower, however it is about 5"" narrower than the mower blades. Half of the grass clippings weren't caught. Appears to be good quality, just is not the right width for 21"" mower. Should be fine for 16"". If you want it to catch 50% of the grass, this is the bag for you."
2,Grass Catcher Review,"Bought this item for the Scotts 2000-20 20-Inch Classic Push Reel Lawn Mower but it doesn't fit. Too narrow. Otherwise, after viewing the product, it seems it would do it's job."
4,Works well with Scott's Mower,"The grass catcher works well with the Scott's Reel Mower. It's easy to attach, detach and empty. It would be nice to have a little better instructions on assembly, but it was easy to put together. If you're buying a reel mower, I would recommend this product."
4,As good as it gets,"I bought this item for my 14"" Great Lakes push mower. It was easy to install; took about 5 minutes. It has a couple of shortcomings:- be careful when pulling your mower in reverse, as the grass may spill- fills up pretty quickly on the left side of the bin (which is where the mower shoots the grass clippings)I have a small city lawn (backyard is 20' x 30') and I was scooping the grass clippings out of the bin, or pushing them to the right side of the bin quite often.That being said, it was much easier and more enjoyable than raking. I figure any grass catcher would have similar problems, though, due to the design of the mower. This is a good choice (and very affordable) and I am happy with my purchase."
4,It works just fine for me!,"I have an 18"" Scott's Reel mower and this catcher works very well. No, it doesn't catch every blade of grass, but I don't think any design would. The only issue I had with it was the loops that are suppose to hook around each other to give the bag stability kept coming apart. I used a couple cable ties and that fixed the issue. I'm not sure if this would work on a 20"" reel mower or not. This sized fit my 18"" perfectly but I think it might be too small for a 20"". If they fixed the loop design, I would give it 5 stars."
1,Richard,"Disappointed. It is supposed to work with all real mowers, and best for widths no larger than 18"". I have a Craftsman 18"" mower. The bag easily attaches, but the grass does not collect anywhere but the front of the catcher. So every few minutes the grass has to be pushed by hand to the back. If not, it falls off the front in clumps."
3,"OK, But Nothing Great","It is what it is: Simple to assemble (but if you need to use the ""hooks"" for an 18"" make sure they face the right direction) and works as described. Backing up will dislodge the catcher is you do not raise the handle. Need to maintain a good speed for it to catch cuttings optimally."
3,AMERICAN LAWN GRASS CATCHER,"Not the greatest product ever designed, but still does the job. Problem I have is grass filling up faster on one side of the bag than the other. I have to stop mowing and use my hands to move the grass over to the other side of the bag,or it stops picking up. It's better than leaving grass on your yard after mowing, but not much."
3,be careful,"It worked great the first few times I used it. but through trial and error you cannot store it standing up, us must let it stay flat because once the bottom develops a bend in it(cardboard part) the grass just flows back out. so lay it flat or hang it up."
1,Did not fit - measure carefully,"Even though it is the ONLY reel-mower grass catcher that they sell at the American Lawn website, it does NOT universally fit all ""American Lawn"" reel mowers. Very frustrating. The instructions use technical language and graphics, not end-user friendly. We tore apart the grass catcher trying to make it fit, and I'm still hoping we are able to make it work somehow, in the meantime, I am still raking. I saved a couple bucks buying the catcher at Amazon instead of the American Lawn website."
1,"""American"" Lawn Mover made in CHINA!","I really give it zero starts. This does not fit the mower it is advertised with, nor the sizes it states it accomodates. Another crappy Chinese product."
5,fits great with my american 14' reel mower,wasn't to hard to install. im 5'4 female and did it all on my own. it catches all the grass and makes clean up a breeze. i ordered it through amazon and recieved it 5 days later with free shipping. work's great for me!
1,A Bad Idea,"If only I knew then what I know now. The mower is a wonder of design, but this ""grass catcher"" simply does not work. A very, very mechanically-gifted neighbor performed the assembly, and afterwards took it off the mower with the comment, ""This is just a really bad idea."" The device may be compatible with another mower, but not with the Scott's push mower that I just reviewed. To add insult to injury, no invoice was in the box, so I'm not sure how to return it. $25+ down the drain."
2,No Alternative,"I bought this because I needed to compost my grass clippings and there are no alternatives. Fairly easy to install,you'll have to empty it every couple of passes, as it holds very little. You need to remember to lift the handle when you back up or the catcher will fall off. A little practice and you can make do. Certainly not the best product, butagain, there's really no alternative."
1,"Doesn""t work while mowing, too flimsy.","It attaches at the bottom with a plastic grip that takes too much effort to attach, similar to a plastic bag, you need to peal it on and off. The worst part, it is too flimsy to hold grass while pushing. The bottom bows, and the grass is forced back onto the reels. You can see in their advertisement picture the slight bow already, it bows halfway up the catcher, pretty bad. Waste of money, wasted of shipping."
1,1ST-SP Reel Mower Grass Catcher,"Where do I start? What, I don't believe about 100-negative reviews? This catcher WILL NOT WORK ON A SCOTTS 20"" MOWER!!!!! It's at least two inches too narrow, and the hardware provided has no place for attachment to the mower. Scotts probably does not market a catcher because the mower was designed to be sold without one. Now I even hate the mower. This product should be removed from any association with Scotts 20"" Classic Mower."
4,Cant miss!,"This is not your parents S. American music....it's electric, grrreat rythym and beat, you can groove to it, not repitetive at all. Buy it if...you like the ""andean"" sound, but like your music to have some ""bottom"". I can listen to it consecutively ( rare for me!) And I never get tired of it! Hope you like it as much as I did!"

5,Probably the best place to begin studying gun control.,"Of all the political battlefields concerning gun control in America, few have seen more action than the role of guns and gun control in other societies. Kopel's book is therefore one of the most useful texts available on this issue. Kopel gives a far more rigorous analysis than the lobbyists on either side of the debate. This book has been cited in numerous books and law reviews ever since its publication. The scholarly credentials of this work are excellent: each important point is researched and well referenced. As an Englishman, I found his chapter on Great Britain to be accurate and well informed. Definitely a five star book."
5,Beautiful music,"Beautiful music and sound from nature and reflection of the indian culture.By hearing to this cd you could have a feeling what it was living in that time, their victories and their threats.Best cd with nature sound i have bought."
4,My dogs love this toy!,"This has become my dog's favorite toy. Unfortunately, they chew the handle when I am not looking, so it is a bit worn.If they made the handle a bit sturdier, this would get a 5 star rating.If you have an active dog, buy this ball, you won't be sorry and neither will your dog."
3,Fair,Works well but is a little cumbersom to work with and a little to bulky to stick in your pocket. Performance is as expected but the crazy handle is in the way and looks strange
4,Sounds good,"I haven't used the ATRAC yet and set up a CD, but it seems like a nice option. Didn't skip on a long car ride, even with my mom's bumpy driving. The only problem is no radio and keeping it away from my brother."
3,ok for the price,It holds Atrac3 and atrac but no play list so I am thinking about an mp3 player so it is worth the money
2,Grr.....,"Ok If you buy this its an ok CD player, but i would advise EXTENTED WARENTY mine broke in 2 days so i got a new one personaly i would have gone with another brand but thats all best buy had at the time and i needed a cd player"
4,Sammy Davis Jr. in musical GOLDEN BOY,"This 1964 show has a very fine score by Charles Strouse and Lee Adams...a much darker score than is usual for this team. The original Capitol Lp was withdrawn and re-released with some of the tracks re-recorded by Sammy Davis who was in poor voice when the original album sessions were held. Also the re-release has ""The Fight"" (essentially a dance number) instead of the actual show finale used on the first release. It is the 2nd album that has served for all 3 CD releases. (Apparently the master tapes for the originals are long gone.)The re-recorded songs are: ""Night Song"", ""Stick Around"", ""I Want To Be With you"", and ""Can't You See it.""Even with the re-recorded tracks this album is well worth having. One of the best tracks, however, is Billie Daniel's song ""While the City Sleeps."""
3,Get what you pay for,"Simply put, you get what you pay for. Besides being full of spelling/grammatical errors, it also had the wrong answers printed (The answers did not match the explanations). I also noticed that a lot of the material was copied straight out of the DAT book. It might be more helpful to just purchase a DAT study guide in addition to a MCAT book to brush up on physics. If you have twenty dollars to spare, go ahead and buy this book. It's better than nothing."
1,wrong answers are not helpful,"Like the other review said, this book is full of spelling and grammar mistakes as well as wrong answers. It would say that E was the correct answer and then go on to say why B was the correct answer. Other times, the answers were just flat out wrong. I had a friend who took the Kaplan review course in which they gave her a large review book full of study material. I studied that and it helped A LOT. If you can get your hands on the review book from the course, I would definitely recommend that, but as for this OAT book, I'd pass."
4,Creative Zydeco CD!!!,"Sean Ardoin's first solo CD continues to creatively push Zydeco music while holding on to important elements of the culture. For those people who want to put Zydeco music in a box and want the music to sound like older Zydeco Musicians, this may not be the CD for you. However, if you love the music and are open to hearing the Zydeco Nation's new emerging artist, this CD is a must have! ""Lil' Lawman Girl,"" ""Got My Jelly Workin',"" ""Long Time,"" and ""2 Fingers,"" are hot hot Zydeco songs and still pack a dance floor in Southwest Louisiana and Texas when played!I have all of Sean's CD's, but this self titled CD has some sentimental value to me because you can see Sean's creative base begin to really define the ""Zydekool sound."" Sean definitely is on the cutting edge when it comes to Zydeco and Southern Soul Music, you'll listen to this CD over and over and find something new! And by the way, you'll be dancing while you do it!"
3,poor quality,"toy arrived damaged, simple gluing 'fixed' it. the base the rings sit on is tilted and I have been unable to solve it, cant say if this was result of poor manufacturing or my repair but either way.... fairly sure the solved puzzle will not be able to be moved so is not much of a display piece."
5,Great book!,The instructions are easy to follow. There are great tips for beginners that only experts have learned after years of soapmaking. The pictures are gorgeous.
3,"Fine Book, Bad title","I ordered this book and looked through it. Despite the title, it doesn't have as many m&p; recipes as you'd think (24, not a lot for the size of the book). The rest of the book is about other things, like triple milled soap, bath salts, bubble bath, bath and massage oils, and bath powders. I guess that's fine, but what I really wanted was a book with nothing but m&p; recipes.The m&p; recipes have (what I consider to be) an excessive about of fragrances and colors. Like, the honey soap has three scents and two colors, when all you need is a honey scent to reinforce the natural scent and no color if you use clear base."
3,"Pretty good, but a little dated on technique","This one is not bad.. a little dated, on technique, pictures etc.. - but its ok.I found two other books that I liked much better.Melt and Mold Soap Crafting by C. Kaila Westerman&300 Handcrafted Soaps by Marie Browning (out of print.. but this is a MUST Have for visual inspiration! Go and pick up a used copy, you will not regret getting this one)"
4,Nice Overview,"I really enjoyed this book. It's great for a beginner and is not overwhelming. There are instructional pictures in the front of the book and lovely pictures of finished products throughout. The back of the book also has a nice section on complimentary fragrances and groups the various recipes into families, which makes it easy to see which soap compliments which bath bomb, etc. There are also some nice ideas on packaging. I would definitely recommend this to someone just starting out."
4,Soap Making for the Novice,"This book is Great! The instructions are easy to follow, as well as clear and concise. Recipes are simple and will inspire you to follow along, or create your own custom blends.The author includes packaging solutions along with numerous ideas to compliment a gift basket presentation. I read this book everyday, and find it to be a wealth of knowledge for anyone interested in the art of soapmaking.I was disappointed, when I was unable to find a Supplier's Resource Guide at the end of the book. I spent endless minutes on the internet searching for ""the liquid soap"" mentioned in the book, as well as the ""bee mold"".The Resource Guide is in the beginning of the book. However, Suppliers are listed in the title category of ""Acknowledgements."""
3,reina sin corona,"Como biografía de Cristina Fernández, pareciera que la autora tenía poco que decir y rellenó la historia con la crónica de la historia reciente de Argentina. Esperaba más, pero quizá no hay más."
4,Now this is a classic,"Most ""classics"" have a bad reputation. They are praised to high heaven in textbooks and literary publications...and force-fed to students in literature classes. But this book is as fresh, hilarious and biting as if it were written this season. It moves at a brisk pace and holds you to the end. What a REAL classic should be."
4,a classic - please buy it,"The book, What Makes Sammy Run? has such wit - about screenwriters in 1930s Hollywood, which created a controversy back in 1941 when it was published. Every producer, actor, writer was looking over their shoulder wondering if he or she was in the book, albeit fictionalized with another name and so forth. Budd Schulberg, the author, is still alive, at 94."
4,Good book despite an annoying narrator,"I liked this book. But I disliked Al Manheim, the narrator of ""What Makes Sammy Run?"", much more than Sammy Glick, a person Al considers a total sleaze. Al drinks too much, he's puritanical about sex, and uniformly condemning of Sammy, even when Sammy does something -- such as starting a newspaper column about radio (The book is set in the 1930's, folks) that is actually a brillant business move. Also, I found Al's newspaperman pose -- curt, cynical, seen it all -- dated and annoying. Plus, the critical Al was basically passive and stuck in the bar, crying in his beer, while Sammy grew a career. Sammy Glick is definitely an unethical opportunist. But he was often no worse than those he competed with. My advice: Give a guy a break Al, and stop your whining!"
2,Highly dissapointed,"I was extremely dissapointed in this book. Perhaps its age shows, but by the last thirty years' standards, Sammy Glick would be a choir boy today in Hollywood. The writing style and technique are excellent, but the story is, at best, weak. Today, Sammy Glick would get run over, instead of running. There are no sympathetic characters in this book, and as for an insiders view of Hollywood, it just isn't there. Again, maybe it's a time frame problem, but if you are looking for any clue about today's Hollywood, this ain't it. Boring. And the Reagan bashing at the end is laughable, especially from someone writing from Quoge."
2,disappointing!,"I'd read so much about this book, I figured it had to be half-way decent. But it's just awful. The language is dated, (Hemingway said, ""All slang grows stale,"" and he's right!) and the writing is BAD. It's lousy writing! The pace is hyperkinetic, and not in some appealing Kerouac way. And the Reagan-bashing afterword written by Shulberg in 1989 is just bizarre, especially considering that Elia Kazan and Budd Shulberg wrote ON THE WATERFRONT as a metaphor for justifying their own naming names for the blacklist during the McCarthy-ish communist witch hunts. Shulberg pandered to right-wing extremism as much as a person can. Maybe that's WHY he wrote the Reagan-bashing afterword, as an absolution for his past sins. But it's too little, too late. Aside from that, the book is just lousy technically and aesthetically."
4,Fantastic Old Hollywood Tale,I read this after hearing Betty Davis say it was the best book ever written about Hollywood. A great read.
3,Clean out your closet,"If you want to clean out your closet, this book will be helpful. I managed to get rid of quite a bit of useless clothes after reading this book. However, if you want a book to help you decide what you should be wearing this isn't the book for you.It does have a section on deciding what your fashion style is and tips on what to wear for different body types. But, I came away from these sections with little truly useful information. The shopping section also seemed to be geared towards people who can shop for clothes every month or so and spend hundreds of dollars on each trip.Get this book to clean out your closet and a different book to take shopping for your new clothes."
4,Very useful book,"This was the book that got me interested in style and taught me to invest in myself. I bought it when I was a confused college grad shopping for office clothes. The section on cleaning out your closet and getting rid of things that don't work anymore was priceless-I gave half of my clothes to charity and was much better off. It explains how to navigate stores and teaches a lot about proportion. It has been a wonderful addition to my (growing) collection of fashion books. However, it isn't particularly well organized and there isn't much detail about specific clothing categories (pants, skirts...) Overall, a great read that you will turn to again and again."
4,Very useful book,"I wouldn't recommend this as a ""stand alone"" book for building a wardrobe. I believe it should be used in conjunction with other books, such as Leah Feldon's Does This Make Me Look Fat? and Clinton Kelly and Stacy London's Dress Your Best : The Complete Guide to Finding the Style That's Right for Your Body. These books are better for helping to decide what looks best on different body types. Having said this, there are several ideas I found useful...such as the circle of life (for determining the types and amounts of clothes needed for the individuals' activities), keeping a clothes diary (to see what money is being spent on) and also cleaning out closets (getting rid of clothes that no longer fit the body or fit the lifestyle). Definitely worth the money just for these three ideas alone."
3,Not for Novices,"This book offers solid advice,however, I would not recommend this book to someone who is unfamiliar with fashion terminology or as a ""starter"" book for one who is beginning to examine her image.The book was enjoyable and sensible and offered some good psychological insights as to why a closet and wardrobe may be problematic. I would recommend this book be used as a follow up to another, when a reader is ready to get down to the nuts and bolts of building a wardrobe and organizing the pieces she has."
3,The Purple Ink is a Bit of a Turn-Off,"I got this book from the library after seeing it here on Amazon. The book is printed entirely in dark purple ink with purple line drawings. There are no photographs of any kind in the book. After a cursory inspection, the book appears to be a workbook to help you determine the right clothes for your life and personality. You'll have to do the exercises and quizzes in the book to get much out of it. If you want to invest the time, this might be a great book. I'm too lazy and would rather have a book with full color photos so that I can get the information quickly and visually. Dress Your Best is quick and easy. How Not to Look Fat is concise and is written with good information in a conversational style, but does not have photos, either. The In Style books have great photos so that you can flip through quickly and absorb information rapidly."
3,don't have a thing to wear,Lots of information I don't need but some good information too.Haven't read the entire book but more for working women in an office
4,I don't have a thing to wear,"This book is going to be great. After working for 40 some years, it is hard to pair down to a retired life style. I hope that it will motivate me and give insight into what I should keep and what I should donate. I don't believe that if you haven't worn it for a year, throw it out. Part of my clothes are climate specific. I don't visit the same place every year, but I do need some of the items, like heavy winter coat for Alaska. I can't wait to finish the book and start the closet. Thanks for writing it and getting us all started in a positive direction."
2,"lots of fluff, minimal content","Few working women have enough spare time to wade through the silliness and fluff in this book. There are endless anecdotes (none of which I nor anyone I know could relate to), apparently in an effort to justify the price for such meager content. After threshing - and threshing is the right word - through the first five chapters in an effort to get to the FACTS that I could actually use, I finally decided the effort wasn't worth the return."
3,Only 40 pages for Umbria,"Good content. There are only 40 pages devoted to Umbria however. Florence, Roma, and Tuscany are the focus."
4,Little Miss Matched Kooky Hearts Valance,"This product is reversible, so you can have the green with pink hearts on one side or flip it over to have pink and green stripes on the other. Product was exactly as described."
5,MissMatched Valance,Great Valance made in durable material. REally finish off the window well and look so neat with the other MissMatched linens.
2,Boring,"I have read all of Jonathan Kellerman's books and this one is the most boring of the bunch. He takes forever to get to the point. His characters are bland and I don't care anymore about his love interest with Robin, which takes up half of the book. He needs to get on with his life. The mystery part and conclusion take up the last 5 chapters and even that is no mystery and not even exciting. I just wanted the book to end and it seemed like it never would. The book just kept driving around Hollywood and stopping at bars and street signs. I feel like I could drive in Hollywood according to J. Kellerman's directions. Too predictable."
5,From another mystery writer,"I am always delighted to discover a new Alex Delaware novel on the book stands, and I almost always buy it the moment I see it. What I find so wonderful about this series is that it always seems fresh, as if I am reading Kellerman for the first time. While the plots are strong and move along well, what intrigues me most are the relationships among the characters. I like Alex for his quick wit and for his compassion for victims, but I love his human failings, too. The wonderful thing is that Delaware's inherent goodness may be jarred, but is never overcome by the violence he sees in his work with Sturgis."
3,Did I Miss a Chapter Somewhere?,"What the heck happened to the ending?! We get so much detail in every chapter of the book, yet the coup de grace occurs off page? Lame. It's as if Kellerman suddenly realized he had another appointment and needed to wrap this baby up IMMEDIATELY. Disappointing ending, but overall a decent read."
2,Hate to say boring...but it's boring.,"This one just never took off for me. This is my first book by this author, and I'm thinking he's bound to be able to do better than this. Thin characters, thin plot, overall not exciting. I kept waiting for something to happen, something to keep me reading more and it just never came. Painful to get through, so put this one at the bottom of your wish list."
3,Not his best work,"I think he made such an issue of Dr. Delaware's personal life (switching from Robin to Allison) that he lost track of what could have been an interesting mystery plot.He seems to do his best work when his character is firmly ensconced with his long time girlfriend (Robin) and his mind is free to concentrate on the mystery at hand.It doesn't take a ""psychiatrist"" to realize that upheavals in one's personal life distracts them from the work at hand."
4,"Get here, but don't start here","I enjoy series in this genre, and this book's no disapopintment. A continuing development of Alex Delaware's life in the first person combines with a focus on Detective Petra Connor (and her new partner) adds another link to this chain.If you're new to the series, don't start here. Start waaay back. But by all means, get here. The suspense is worth it."
4,Another juicy story,"I really enjoyed this book, especially listening on tape. The reader was excellent as well. So glad Alex has finally found someone that understands his work and has parted from Robin. His new love seems more like a realistically portrayed woman character than Robin ever did. Great story, pretty spooky whodunit!"
4,a cold heart,"the usual good book by kellerman but i would like to see robin back as delewares girlfriend, dont like the new one. too many characters in this book. would like to see det. petra and her new partner in a separate book, and would also like to see a little more focus on milo and rick. bring back robin!"
1,Boring,"I've bought and read Kellerman's whole Alex Delaware series, but this is one I truly regret spending the money on. Maybe I'm a traditionalist, but I totally resent the first-person/third-person switch--especially to this extent. It gives off the odor of a trashy, lazy effort.This story came to a screeching halt every time it switched into third. I liked Petra Connor in Billy Straight, but her partner was disgusting. I realize that was the point, but I nearly didn't care enough to finish the book. The plot moved very slowly, very standard stuff.Much as I like the series, I think I'll borrow the next one from the library before buying outright. I'd like to see Kellerman recapture the depth and emotion of Silent Partner."
4,Psycho murders,"LAPD Homicide detective Milo Sturgis involves his friend, criminal psychologist Dr.Alex Delaware inwhat seems to be a case of serial murders where artists and musicians are killed, with their bodies carefully arranged after death to suggest that the killer is deliberately the fact to boast to police.Alex and Milo fear that they've come across a new kind of celebrity killer, one who sets out to kill artists and musicians who have either become successful or who are on the brink of financial success.It's a very fast paced story, one of those which becomes a quick read because it's virtually impossible to put down."
3,On a roll,The author has found a way to keep these books moving. Changing narrators has added zip to the series. Good job.
2,Disappointing Point in Series,"As it is published, I purchase, save, and reread each Kellerman.It's fiction; it's his vision/talent/genius. But the serial murder schtick was carried too far. The plot became cluttered. The writing is always stimulating; Alex and Milo are engrossing characters. But why write out Robin? Allison's positive reinforcement to Alex must comfort him but she's too much a clone; I find her boring. Robin was an interesting and worthy partner with Alex and Milo. Please, J.K., figure a way to bring her back as Alex's love interest"
2,This cable not for use with some Swann Cameras,The transformer shipped with the SWANN Maxi Day/Night Camera will not fit this cable. Swann said they would send an adaptor but have not done so.
2,Looses electric power,"I used this cable for my night vision Q-SEE QSB550SR camera. At day time everything worked just fine, but at night the camera would just turn off automatically. It turned out the electric current from the power adapter was just getting ""lost"" in the cable. So the camera simply did not get enough power for its IR lenses.This cable may work OK if you plan to use it with a small regular camera without the night vision function, but I don't recommend it for the night vision cameras."
3,Bought these then found a better deal,"These cables work fine and the quality seems to be good. However, since buying these I have found another source for similar cables that is considerably cheaper. I wish that I had looked harder before ordering these."
2,Really...don't waste your time,"Bought this DVD a couple of years ago when it was on sale, thinking that it would have uncensored bits much like its E! counterpart, ""The Girls Next Door."" No dice. Despite rumors to the contrary, there's nothing of substance here that couldn't be seen on the original broadcasts, and even those weren't very good."
4,trotters and pacers,"Another wonderful book from Marguerite Henry, this one tells 2 stories in one, which is a very unusual structure for her. I loved this book as a kid and was looking for a new copy. If you look at the images, you'll see the 2 different covers for this book, the original, by Wesley Dennis, shows a trotter - the new image for the cover, by a different artist, shows a pacer. This gait, while used by Standardbred horses, is very different than a trot. That's sort of like putting a football player on the cover of a baseball hitting manual! It's sad that the people who now publish her works don't seem to know what the books are about!Luckily the text is still right, and the story still wonderful."
5,Born To Trot By Marguerite Henry,"This is a wonderful childrens classic. I just purchased it from a marketplace seller and read it to my youngest child. I am now on the hunt for more books by this author. When i purchased this book I had no idea it was school bound as the seller was clueless to this feature. School bound books are tough and will last for ever, unlike a normal paperback. The story of this book was very easy to follow for my 4 year old and it left her imagination run wild within the story. A must have book for any parent who loves to read to their child. Also this book is illustrated by the late great: SIR WESLEY DENNIS, which is a bonus !"
2,Look for something else,"I bought this as a gift and will be returning it, for the reasons stated by the other reviewers. The basic problem here is that whatever the native resolution of this thing is, it's a 4:3 aspect ratio. The screen, however, is physically at a 16:9 aspect ratio. It is therefore physically impossible for it to properly display an undistorted picture. The workarounds suggested by other reviewers will work, but should not be necessary.In addition, the picture quality is quite poor even apart from the aspect ratio problem, and there are no brightness or contrast controls. Also, the stand only provides for landscape display.I should add that I downloaded the firmware update from the company's website. This allows it to display pictures with a correct aspect ratio ... by compressing them horizontally, leaving grey bars on either side. This is not an acceptable fix."
3,aspect ration fix available,"I am researching a unit to buy so I cannot personally atest to good or bad. Howerver, to share with other potential customers the company lists a firware fix to allow the unit to give 4:3 aspect ratio. whether it works is another issue."
1,Don't buy this,I purchased this and quickly returned it because the quality is very poor. The pictures are distorted and grainy. I recommend spending and extra 50 dollars and purchase the Smartparts SPDPF84.
1,Mine gets returned - Aspect Ratio not maintained,"Who designed this? I want my pictures to look normal, not stretched and flattened. I just cannot not figure out how this type of product gets to the market place. Did a bunch of 7 foot skinning designers work on this project, and used their picture to test the unit. They must have liked the way they looked squished to 6 feet tall.Most of us are 5 to 6 feet tall, and when we look 4 to 5 feet tall, and even fatter, well u get the point. The unit is going back.Bob"
1,VERY POOR QUALITY !,"I bought this item with high hopes and was dissapointed. I never even got to the loading of photos problems. As soon as I turned this unit on it hissed and crackled like a mustuned radio. Even plugging in headphones does not stop this noise coming from the back of the unit. I think the error message when you try to play a video file from an empty folder sums it all up ""Not find file of type to play"" Obviously this is some cheap asian crap disguised in a Kodak color schemed box!"
3,Just the Book,"New, this book came with CD's for the learner to listen to. Used, it's just the book. I bought this book to help a Spanish-speaking student learn English pronunciation, but it hasn't been helpful. Unless the user is familiar with English pronunciation symbols, working with the book could be a challenge."
2,Another Slapped-Together Biker Film,"I guess ""Angels Hard As They Come"" could've had some potential but it just never delivers. I've read this movie's supposed to be ""hippies vs. bikers"" but it's really ""bikers vs. bikers with hippies in the middle"". However exciting this may sound, it plays out awkwardly and even boobs, drugs, and violence can't save it. Maybe it's the script was weak, or the characters were never really developed, but the main flaw is simply a technical one; most of this film is underexposed. It's simply too dark to see what's going on.Scott Glenn's fans probably expect some hypermacho stuff, but he mostly mumbles and seems oddly passive. This must've been an early role for him.A lot of films in the biker genre were hastily put together and turned out rather dull, and this is one of them. It ain't no ""Devil's Angels""!"
1,Beware! Misleading cover photo!,"Like another viewer I was suckered into buying this really bad flick because of Gary Busey. His appearance comes out of nowhere toward the end and makes no sense at all, as if it were an afterthought. The cover photo of him is NOT from this film and he does NOT play a biker! This garbage has NO redeeming quality whatever. Echo Bridge Entertainment is on my ""S"" list!"
1,Angel's Hard As They Come,"Do not buy, stupid cornball boring noncense of a story. I could hardly get thru it."
1,BEYOND POOR,"I'm a fan of Gary Busey and I know this was one of his first movies and I know this was originally a B-movie, but his scenes were few and far between and without substance. This was even a poor B-movie. I tried my hardest to find some positive quality about this movie, but could not do it. The picture quality was poor, the acting was poor, the script was poor. I gave it one star, just because some of the bikes were sharp looking. I'd recommend many other biker movies over this one. Don't waste your time."
2,Some Decent Actors in a Really Bad Film,"I enjoy exploitation and biker flicks and ""bad"" cinema but this one just didn't do it for me, I just found this whole mess really annoying, the acting and dialog are terrible, as is the storyline and nonstop background score, I really can't think of anything redeeming this film has to offer except it has some decent actors in early bit parts, but unless you are a die hard biker film fanatic I doubt anyone will enjoy this, it would never have been released on dvd had it not happened to have a few mins of Gary Busey in it."
5,great movie,i got this for agift for my boyfriend. he loves the movie because it has alot of action in it.
2,Not as funny as I remembered,"I saw this movie on TV as a child and remembered it as being very funny. Sadly, it is thin on plot and the gags are predictable. Not one of Sellers' finest films. You might think that it is only the passage of time that has made the gags less amusing, but you only have to watch The Party to realise what great comedy looks like."
3,Sellers Shows Acting Chops in Clever Satire,"Big name critics love to pan Sellers' more campy outings and praise his droll, satirical work (as if that makes them look smarter). This film is no exception. Sellers is in fine acting form finding his place in the turbulent 60's with some clever, humorous results. However, it is still like watching psychadelic paint dry while Sellers establishes himself as an actor of some note."
4,Vintage Sellers,"Some film historians consider 1965 to 1974 the ""lost decade"" of Peter Sellers' career. Admittedly, the brilliant comic actor didn't set the box office on fire during that period, yet there were admirable films such as ""The Party"" (1968), ""The Magic Christian"" (1970), ""The Optimists"" (1973) and ""The Blockhouse"" (1973). Included on that list is ""I Love You, Alice B. Toklas"" - a dated yet perceptive counterculture comedy written by Paul Mazursky and Larry Tucker. Sellers delivers one of his finest performances as Harold Fine, an uptight Jewish attorney who undergoes a ""groovy"" change of life thanks to an attractive flower child (Leigh Taylor-Young) and some potent brownies. A memorable supporting cast includes Jo Van Fleet as Sellers' domineering mother. Easily the best film directed by sitcom veteran Hy Averback. Not too shabby for a so-called ""lost decade."""
4,Andy Warhol?,"This movie was a strange blend of the old world(pre rock and roll) and the hip contemporary one of the ""free love"" 1960's. Now, to be honest, the 1960's was no more free love than any decade, but Hollywood deals in stereotypes, so... In the film, Peter Sellers has to choose between the very dull conventional world and the wild hippy lifestyle. He is tempted, like Ulysses, by an incredible nymph by the name of Leigh Taylor Young. If you are male and saw the movie, you remember that sexy, if innocent by today's stanards, scene. In fact, DVD marketing being what it is, that scene is now the cover piece for the diskette. AS a comedy, the film is thin and doesn't carryover into our epoch well; what you are left with, I am afraid, is a few funny bits of cars being painted in flowepower colors, and the incredible Ms. Young, whose flower was drawn by none other than 1960's guru Andy Warhol himself."
5,"I Love You, Peter Sellers",I love Peter Sellers so much! I really enjoyed it and thought it was pretty funny. Now I need some brownies. Groovy baby.
4,Sellers in top form again,"Hilarious look at conservative Sellers converting to the youth movement of the late Sixties. Just to see him tokin' it up is classic, and did anyone notice just how much he resembles John Lennon?"
4,"My ""I Love You, Alice B. Toklas"" Review","I Love You Alice B. Toklas really is a great movie. Peter Sellers, one of the best actors of all time, is excellent as a business man turned into a hippie all because of a drug-laced brownie. Although rated R it has very little language. If it were made today, it would probably be rated PG-13. It's also true that people don't give this film enough credit. If you like a good comedy or Peter Sellers, see this movie. You'll be glad you did. I hope it comes out on DVD."
2,Not as promoted,"Camerabrght says this unit has a 20' range, but unless you are in a pitch black situation it doesn't. Under normal low light conditions the range is more like 10'. and the color temperature is a very cool bluish tone. And of course they do tell you it will only screw on the bottom of your camera not on a shoe mount."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"JUST RECIEVED THIS PIECE OF JUNK CHORD FINDER, IT S THE WORSE ITEM IVE BOUGHT ONLINE.I WOUNDNT ACCEPT IT EVEN IF IT WAS FREE, ITS HECKA SMALL AND CANT HARDLY SEE THE LITTLE TINY 1X1-1/2 INCH SCREEN LET ALONE THE KEY CHORDS THERE SHOULD BE A LAW AGAINST FOOLING OR MISLEADING THE PUBLIC WITH ITEMS SUCH AS THIS. THE BATTERY IS MORE VAULABLE THEN THE PRODUCT ITSELFON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN I GIVE IT A MINUS 1SHAME ON YOU"
1,Garbage!!!,Reviews are 100% correct... Just turn away now!!! Received mine DOA. Was so mad I decided not to send it back just so I could burn it and iss on the ashes.
4,Grreat Gadget,"The instructions are difficult to read, but the item is easy to figure out how to use."
2,Akai Keyboard finder,The item was of inferior quality and was difficult to get to work. I returned the item for a refund.
4,Great book for reading aloud to children,"This book is hilarious. We read it to our 7 month old right before bed, and even though she doesn't understand exactly what we are reading, she laughs because we are laughing."
5,Reading Fun,I bought this book to read to my litle grandson who just turned six (Now we are six!). He loves the stories and enjoys the adventures that Christopher Robin has with his own animal friends. Our little one is so much like Christopher Robin and even lives near a large wooded area that he likes to explore. I highly recommend the book. the pictures are lovely and the quality is very good.
4,Because the box it came in was damaged.,would recommend it to others daughter loves it! Was just upset that it was not packaged better for transit. I had to get a different box to wrap it and had to clean it up had some smudges on it. From shipping damage.
3,Soccer ball,Ordered as a gift for Christmas and ti arrived in a timely fashion. Does not glow in the dark very well.Son loves it
5,good ball,"good solid ball, my niece really likes it plus she will use it with the franklin glow in the dark soccer goals."
1,Disappointing,"The ball has no luminosity and for all practical purposes, is just another soccer ball. Our children were so disappointed!!"
3,Nice ball but it doesnt glow in the dark. :(,"I bought this ball because it suppose to glow in the dark, but it doesn't!!!If you are considering to buy this ball because it glows, I wouldn't recommend you this ball. But this is nice ball for the kids to play with."
1,ball is not round,The ball is not round. It would not roll in a straight line. Overall quality is poor even though its surface looks nice.
1,Not up to par,This was a Christmas present for my 8 year old. We go jogging at night and he loves kicking the ball when we jog. The ball DOES NOT glow in the dark and we had several splits on the ball. Looks like someon took a razor and cut it all up.
3,This is a gift,I got this a gift for a donation toy drive. I hope the child receiving enjoys it greatly this holiday season.
3,Not so brite,"It's a good concept but it really just isn't bright enough nor does it retain it's brightness for long. I'm not sure why they either don't make the whole ball out of the luminescent material or at least most of it. We tried to use it at practice but it really was easier to see the white balls. I had one of the coaches hold the ball in front of a car light and then it would work really well for a couple of minutes. We had two of them and we just kept swapping them out during the scrimmage. Again, it's a great idea but it doesn't really work.Lastly, it is true this is a low quality ball. It's fine for limited use in the backyard but it's not going to hold up for a whole soccer season."
2,stitching came apart within weeks,"This ball looks very cool and my son was excited to get it for Christmas. But after only a few weeks of playing with it occasionally, the seems started to bust apart in one section. Now it is unusable. Beware!"
5,Great Buy,"My niece's soccer team colors are blue and yellow so this caught my attention for her. The yellow squares glow brightly in the dark. She thinks it is great and can't wait until soccer starts again after the holidays. I can't speak for durability as I just gave it to her but it appears to be well made. And, as a bonus it came with a hand pump and needle to blow it up."
1,Don't get suckered,"One star is too many for this book. This book is fine if you like guessing what style of beer goes with what food ingredients. But most of us don't - that's why we buy a book we think will tell us. This book is okay if you like throwing out your food because you put a too hoppy beer in it and it tastes really bitter or you used a malty beer and it made everything too sweet. For someone who claims to know beer, this author doesn't show that in the book. Every recipe simply calls for ""beer"". Is that a stout? Is that an IPA? Is that an American mass-produced watery beer? Is that a malty beer - a hoppy beer? Big difference in beers. Big difference in how they react with various ingredients. I was overwhemlmingly disappointed with this book. It's getting returned."
5,"Beer Loving Cooks, and Cooks Loving Beer!",I received this book as a gift and have since ordered 4 more to give to friends. I called the author and she personally autographed and sent the copies to me within a couple of days.The recipes are unique AND tasty. The trivia is fun and original.I could become one heck of a cook with a book like this!They're available by calling Nob Hill Press at 920.336.3429.
1,May Sr. Joan keep searching,"This is the first, supposedly Catholic, book I read from a feminist perspective. It was an eye-opener for me. Each time she bashed the Church, I felt like my heart was being stabbed. The words of Jesus to St. Paul on the road to Damascus came to mind, ""Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?""I love the Creed. Often, when I plan to say the Rosary, I don't get past this prayer; I find it so rich for contemplation, for strengthening my faith.I felt sad for Sr. Joan. I find the title, ""In Search of Belief"" very apt; she is still searching. At the time of writing, she found it ""impossible"" to believe many of the Truths of the Catholic Church, yet she contiues to be a Catholic sister. Why?"
2,Getting a bit too much,These religiosity books are getting to be a bit too much. Real progressives should just stop following any canned religion; that is what I have done.
4,surprisingly gory and interesting,"this is a cool little scifi/horror movie. i heard about this movie from the exploitation book Nightmare USA. The Deadly Spawn wasn't as epic as i hoped it might be, but it surely didn't disappoint me either.some shots, special effects, and gushes of blood were downright inspired! a couple scenes came off flat and one dialog scene was a little blurry, plus i could tell in a couple spots where the production had been rushed. i heard that the vegetarian party was phenomenal and to me it seemed just OK. also, the ending didn't really thrill me. hence the 4 stars.ia ia,Venger As'Nas SatanisCult of Cthulhu High Priest"
1,Incredibly bad Blu-Ray,"Do not waste your money on the Blu-Ray! The video quality, is far, FAR below that of the existing DVD! Hazy, blurry, full of noise reduction, aliasing, and other artifacting and barely taking up 9GB of the disc."
1,Terrible Blu-Ray transfer,"The Deadly Spawn is a low-budget 80's video classic. Unfortunately, it's been give a low-budget Blu-Ray transfer by producer Ted A. Bohus. The initial batch of Blu-Ray discs were recalled by Elite Entertainment due to over-excessive use of noise reduction. A new transfer was promised, resulting in the disc available now. What we ended up with an upscaled version of the vastly superior DVD version by Synapse. If you want the best image quality, buy that version and let your player upscale it. This Blu-Ray is an insult to to the film and it's fans."
2,Sorry film and Gorry film,"hate to say it but it is one the most boring horror movies i have ever seen i dont know why but it nearly put me to sleep i only would say buy this movie if ur into cheezy 80's horror flicks....which normaly I am, but not the case with this film but in its defense i will say the kill secnes were bloody and no bad for when it was made which is why it got two stars instead of one."
4,Very strange,"I've just watched this movie and to be honest, I don't know what to make of it. It's very weird, even by the standards of things I usually watch. Still, I didn't fell like it was a waste of time and I was in a bad mood to begin with, so taking that into consideration, overall I think I should give it a positive score.Anyway, the movie mostly takes place inside of a house. It has more preliminary victims than most horror movies before they introduce the main cast. The house is invaded by fish/tadpole-like aliens, and a larger alien that has three mouths and two very frail limbs, but somehow manages to break down doors.Damn, I've been staring at the screen for a few minutes now, and I don't really know what else to say. I guess that's it."
4,what the h... !? & ....!,"Awesome spectacle for this original horror film; like none other nor itself. I wish there was a 'lil more scene action in the begin & midfilm. The end showed this tri or is it quad or more thing more dried up-gets cheesy-well it has 80's horror influence/film quality. See it if ya dare, its intensely freaky/morose, especially from begin to midfilm. Its all good enough action though but where did it come from & why?"
3,From the Spawns' mouth,"As someone who worked as a puppeteer on this film, I can tell y'all it was made on a shoestring, but with lots of heart by a bunch of horror fans who were just doing it for love of the craft. Many of these folks are now professionals, and many of us ... well, aren't :). But we all have affection for our time spent on this project - even if it was spent getting Karo blood dripped on me out of a honey bear while lying under a false floor in John Dodd's basement.DVD is coming soon."
4,Spawn in the Basement,"This is definitely a low budget movie. I remember renting the video years ago and enjoyed it so when I saw it being release on DVD, I decided to pick it up. There are gory parts in the movie (if you don't like gory movies, this one may not be for you) but there is also some humor.The quality is not bad and there are plenty of extras.The movie starts with a meteor crash. What comes from the meteor are aliens that grow to huge proportions after devouring a couple of humans. The aliens invade a nearby home by starting out in the basement and one by one eat all that enter their lair. The only one that does not get eaten is a young boy, Charles, who seems to understand how they ""think""."
2,Might Dissapoint...,"With all the positive reviews for this movie I was very excited to see it. After recently doing so I found it pretty dissapointing.I'm a huge fan of b-movie horror but I guess I was expecting too much. While the movie does have some excellent visual effects and fun gore it simply isn't enough to excuse a pretty boring story, forgettable characters with no development, and horrible sound quality that bugged me throughout the film.Basically it's like watching Peter Jackson's Bad Taste or Attack of the Killer Tomatoes (2 movies I DO highly recommend) with none of the laughs.Who knows maybe you will really enjoy this movie, just beware going into it with the high expectations I had."
3,great creature design!,"great creature design in this flick, reminded me of Audrey 2 from Little shop of Horrors. great score to this one too, really liked the music. worth checking out for sure, kind of cheesy and slow but if you've got the patience, make it so."
4,"""What the f#@k was that!?""","Made for reportedly less than $25,000 this mega-low budget alien invasion flick is more enjoyable (thanks to an intelligent script, great fx's and cool camerawork) than 90% of the horror flicks belched out of mainstream Hollywood.A meteor carrying little evil flesh-eating tadpoles crashes near a remote house. After munching on some campers the icky worms with hundreds of jagged teeth grow and attack the people in the house with gusto complete with face chomping, head removal, skin ripping, eyeball eating, leg biting, toe biting and so forth. Cool gruesome 80's fun, check it out. The DVD has a beautiful print."
4,admirable,"Belle compilation de ballades de Demis Roussos. Je pensais qu'on pouvait faire une compilation de Grecs célèbres mais ce n'est pas le cas. Dommage, car un autre Grec mérite le détour, c'est Dimitri Tambossis avec Poor Soul. Mais ce coffret de Demis est en tout point admirable."
5,Nobody Can Do the Shing-A-Ling.....,"Infectious,groovilicious fun from the Damned... my college room mate had this album.. brings a smile to your face from the first note of the first song and lasts to the very end. If you liked Green Day as the ""Foxboro Hot Tubs"" you will love the Damned as ""Naz Nomad and the Nightmares"". Trust me."
1,I Still Have No Idea,"Bought this book based on a favorable review in a business journal I read ... in fact, bought one for a friend as well. After several attempts to get into this book I no longer care what Queen Esther knew .... My friend didn't care either."
1,Esther Hype,"I read this book because I thought I could learn something about Esther that would empower me to be a smarter ambassador for the God, in the workplace. What I see by reading this book is that God took a backseat to Esther.It's a fact that Esther is the only book of the Tanakh that is not represented among the Dead Sea scrolls. When the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered, the Book of Esther was not found: all the other books were found.What Queen Esther really knew is not that apparent to me, so I quit trying to figure it out."
2,Doesn't work for all Swann cameras,Bought this wire to add additional camera and move others. The wire doesn't work for this and had to be rigged and now the cameras don't work. Extremely disappointed.
4,What the ...?,"It takes a while to get going, but once it does, it's possibly the most bizarre movie I've ever seen. Mr. Joyboy's mother steals every scene she's in."
4,"Great package, extras a bit lacking","While I enjoyed the short featurette, this film deserves a 5-star commentary, at least from Wexler, the DP and producer.This is great to finally have on DVD! A wonderful film."
5,Unbelievably Funny,"I remember seeing The Loved One while still in the service in 1965. I thought it was great then and I still do after almost 40 years. We have to accept this satire of American culture and values and laugh at ourselves. Our great people and nation have the ability to look at ourselves and see our own shortcomings and inconsistancies. Terry Southern did a wonderful job with this film and the cast was fantastic; Rod Steiger in particular. Anyway, if you can find it, watch it and enjoy it."
5,At last on DVD,I found this film by accident while in the UK. It was being broadcast on the BBC and was drawn in to its dark dark humor almost immediately. I think the other reviews here some it up. This is a 'forgotten gem' that is worthy of anyone's collection. The facial adjustment scene is enough on its own!
5,The Loved One,"This is a lost classic which should be revisited. It's entertaining, strange at times & just plain good. Have fun with this strange, complex movie."
3,The Loved One,"Not as cutting edge as it was 40 years ago, but worth a watch. Takes on Hollywood, funerals, the church...just to name a couple of key ones."
3,"Strange comedy, not for all tastes","MY RATING: 6.4I've watched this one last night on tv, and I must say its's quite an odd mov. It's a comedy, a black comedy as many say, yet it's not for all tastes since cause it contains an amount of strange characters and situations. Some good points for the presentation of the eternal rest of the loved ones and that horrid mother of Rod Steiger, who is probably the best character on the film. Also starring Robert Morse as the brit who has just arrived from London, John Gielgud as his gay uncle, a dual role for Jonathan Winters, Roddy McDowall, Robert Morley and the irritating voice of Anjanet Comer.Really an mov with some importance in the 60's, but nothing special now."
1,"I'm definitely in the minority, here","I liked the book, and have always been a great fan of Jonathan Winters, and of humor of all kinds. Nothing in the film offended me - it just didn't amuse me, and it seemed amateurish - the editing, the acting, and the overacting of Winters. I just looked up the Bosley Crowther review from the N.Y. Times of 1965. You can find it on the ""Rotten Tomatoes"" website. He liked the satire in the first part of the film, but thought that Winters was just too unsubtle, and he wrote that the things the writers added to the Waugh book resulted at the end of the film in - Bosley Crowther's words - ""witless inanity."" I just saw the film on Turner Classic Movies, and am glad I didn't buy it. I just thought it was unclever & unfunny. But lots of people love it, so what do I know? :-)"
2,Not very good,"My husband and I didn't like this very much. I had seen it years and years ago and remembered it as being funny. It wasn't really, it's too outdated."
5,It's only forgotten....,"... by those who never saw it, and sure would deserve to be released on DVD (and not in fool-screen, please). Casting only would be worth the watch even if this movie was not so good; as are most of other Richardson's movies (his masterpiece, for me being 'Tom Jones'). But, of course, studio's utmost concern being to plague the market with serial crap that any dimwit could watch yesterday on his/her T(otal) V(ulgarity) set. And, since this movie was (in 1965) advertised to have ""something to offend everyone"", it's not likely to be released soon. Especially when you see that 'Politikally Korrekt' addicts' main concern is to be offended whenever they get a chance."
4,"Movie buffs, this one's for you","A movie way before it's time. A satire on the cemetery business in Southern California with Jonathon Winters playing two roles, Rod Steiger as the gay mortician Mr. Joyboy (who dotes on his morbidly obese mother) and you have Liberace selling coffins. There are cameos galore. Black & white, made in the mid-60's, this is a literate, black humor filled art house classic."
5,Enjoyable movie,"I enjoyed this movie because it was not worried about political correctness and didn't give a hoot about offending people. People who are easy offended suck anyway. The characters were very strange and amusing. Joyboy's mother was very entertaining and disgusting with her orgasmic delight in eating. One funny scene was the woman who was about to shoot Milton Berle and then was about to shoot herself because her dog had just died. I'm very attached to my dogs, but I wouldn't go that far. But the movie was amusing the whole time and kept my interest from beginning to end."
3,"Thorough, in more ways then one","I would not read this book if you have never read any other books on the History of early New England. It is very densely written and with the many sentences you sometimes lose sight about what really happened.When you do decide to read this thoroughly (and it will take a long time) it becomes more interesting. The book is a collection of biographies of important people in 17th century New England that made the region what it was and still is today. It is an attempt to pierce into the Puritan mind and he has succeeded.Interesting for those already interested, but unreadable for people who do not know a lot."
2,you get what you pay for,I purchased this product because I had good luck with lanzar amps but I hooked this speaker to a 1000 watt Sony amp and you could smell it burning in less then 5 minutes.
5,Nostalgia fix!,"We had this album at home when I was a kid, and loved it. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and ordered it immediately. The music is great. If you like easy listening, I highly recommend it!"
5,Insight into Greek Ambitions,"This interesting little monograph provides evidence that Greek ambitions to re-create the Byzantine legacy did not stop with their freedom in the 1830s from the Turkish yoke. Their futile war in 1897 marked a serious effort to take adantage of a tottering Ottoman Empire's dilapidation, but ultimately failed in its immediate designs. However, in the succeeding decade they and their Balkan neighbors would all feast on the carcass. The author does a good job of describing the Greek political factions and their machinations to manipulate the Great Powers to their cause."
3,Not as described,"Was so looking forward to my new comforter! Did lots of research and finally decided on this one based on fill power and weight. Much to my surprise, I did not receive what I ordered. There were several differences between the product description and that which actually arrived:Weight - Advertised 33 oz / Received 27 ozFill Power - Advertised 700 - 750 / Received 650+Baffle Box - Advertised 16"" / Received 14""While the comforter seems to be of very good quality, it's not what I ordered. Hopefully they just sent the wrong one and will correct the order. I will update the review accordingly."
1,Dissapointed,The same thing happened to me... researched a lot and finally decided on this one.Ordered 750 got 650 fill powerOrdered 32 oz fill weight and got less.Not happy with this...
3,Not As Advertised,"I had the same experience as two other reviewers: product specs say 700-750fp, yet product label included in package said 650, and the overall weight was a little under that specified onscreen as well. These may be small differences, but they made me distrust the product. Also, it just has an overall thin feel to it, like a lightweight summer comforter, not the heavy winter one I was expecting based on the description. So it cost $20 to ship it back, which doesn't feel right considering the description was inaccurate."
4,Fun and Challenging,"If you don't need reality games with shoot em up type action, this is a skill game that challenges you without being impossible to win. I am a product of the 80's and grew up on Atari games. This is a more simplistic game like the games of old but with advanced graphics of today's games. Plus, it teaches kids lots of information about ocean and marine life while completing each level. My 7 year old enjoys it as well as my 12 year old. I also have fun playing it. Hours of enjoyment for both kids and adults."
3,"Close, but I'm not sure Mr. Sloane would be pleased.","Alas, printed in China and missing the wonderful color plate illustrations found in the original edition."
5,Brings Back Memories,Other reviewers have done a good job of describing this and I agree with them. I'll just add that this wonderfully illustrated book really brought the memories flooding back.
4,"Nice book, but not Sloane's best","This has some interesting history of early barns, especially those of New England. Drawings are well done, as usual. If you are interested in barns west of the Mississippi look elsewhere."
5,All One Tribe cd,"Awesome cd, this is the second copy I've purchased, original one was lost. Beautiful rhythms, upbeat ""happy music""."
5,Fast paced and witty!,"""Bait and Switch"" is the latest effort by Andrew McAleer and it is a lot of fun. James and Sophia have a banter going on between them that will remind you of the style Columbo uses. They appear more caught up in their own issues but all the while are gethering essential information to help them solve the mystery at hand.In this story there is a case of insurance fraud that ultimately leads to James and Sophia coming across a murder. Andrew does a great job in developing loads of characters along the way to add color and contribute to the mystery getting solved.I suggest this book highly. You will read it quickly and want to read more by the author!"
5,WOW!,"Garth Brooks is my favorite singer of all time. I have ALL his CDs/tapes. I found everyone VERY good. Until i found fresh horses. now, i mean this album is (i think) the best that he has made. I was astounded by it! That and his double live cd. But, i have had friends come up to me and ask me to borrow this cd, and i mean NONE of my friends like country music. Thats how good this cd is! Hats of to you Garth! :)"
1,the song i want isn't on here!!!,"It says online that the song, ""To Make You Feel My Love"" is on this CD. I get the CD and the song is not on here! I will not listen to this CD. That is the only song I wanted it for."
3,playing to the crowd,I thimk the trouble with the album is the most of the uptempo song cowboys and angel fever cinderella ect are songs that were put on a ablum to please the younger crowd or simply because he wanted to try something different. the uptempos didnt work but the change and beaches and shes every woman are pure garth not enough to reccomend but ok
2,Bought solely for Cinderella song.,"I heard the Cinderella song a long time ago on the radio and have been trying to track it down since. That is the sole reason I bought this album so that I would own Brook's original as appose to other artists versions of the song. That said, the song doesnt dissapoint me, but the rest of the album does. Nothing else on the album, in my opinion, is worth buying."
3,Not the best Garth album,"Very uneven album which didnt live up to expectations in 1995. Beaches of Cheyenne is the best song. The Change, She's Every Woman, and Ireland are pretty good. Fever is an ok remake but the rest are boring."
4,An excellent CD from an EXCELLENT artist,"Garth Brooks shines through with a wonderful CD with excellent songs. Ireland was an excellent song with beautiful lyrics. And, of course, It's Midnight Cinderella shone through with a glorious amount of humor."
1,I love this CD BUT!!!!!,I played it once and after that no cd player wikl read it. My laptop now shows there is nothing on it.
2,"i want to be a comedy, action film but end up being a camp film","Granted i haven't seen anything by this production company, but its lack of focus though out this film is painful. If you like camp films watch this film. if you like the zombie genre films, forget it its poorly done, the heroin looks crazy and pathetic even with a 4 barrel shot gun. it does cross multiple sci-fi genres but half assed all."
3,A Curmudgeon review,"Well, I watched it. The video quality was fine as well as the special effects.At the beginning we have story building that was fine.My conclusion was that we are having a comedy with zombie/alien overtones.Many of the actors played hysterical characters well; with comedy-like, over-the-tophysteria. This movie morphed into a ""Close Encounters"" type movie with seriousovertones. The movie didn't quite work for me. I am old-school. I believein funny shows, comedy drama, comedy action, and even shows like ""Shawn of the Dead"".Stranger movies, like ""Pulp Fiction"" had comedy that worked. This one didn'tmix. It is different. You may like it, but most people are not as long sufferingas me. If you buy this movie, I bet it gets ""re-gifted""!"
2,"Add this to the list of ""crappy zombie movies"" list","I rented this from Hollywood Video years ago and can still remember how bad it is. For some reason the ratio of good zombie movies to bad is heavily weighted to the bad side and one thing is for sure, Undead gets added to the bad/awful zombie movies. This movie tried being funny at times too but it failed at that too. If you're a huge zombie movie fan like i am and feel the need to watch every zombie movie just so you know you've seen it, i'm giving you some good advice...DON'T waste your time or money on this crappy movie!"
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen!!!!,"This movie was awful. I am not going to go indepth with why I think so, but if I could return it for the $5.99 I paid for it and get paid for the time it took me to watch it...I would ask to get reimbursed. I love ""zombie"" movies with all my heart, but mixing zombies with sci-fi did not do it for me. This movie was also NOWHERE near Peter Jackson's ""Braindead/Dead Alive""...do not listen to the critic on the cover!!! Honestly I would not even recommend the rental of this movie, your time is probably more pretty valuable than the dollar to rent this ""film"". I guess I will have to stick to the classics and next time I will Netflix a movie before I make a blind purchase."
4,The Spierig Brother's Rock !,"If you think the Spierig Brother's didn't purposely confuse you then your an idiot! None of the character's in this film had any idea what was going on so why should you? ""unDEAD"" is truly one of the most entertaining Zombie/sci-fi films that i have ever seen. Crazy has come to town for a visit & i stress the word CRAZY! Everyone compares this to Peter Jackson's ""DEAD-ALIVE"" or Sam Raimi's ""EVIL DEAD"" but I have to say this nutty film has all the gore from those films but it truly reminds me more of Tobe Hooper's crazy sci-fi/zombie classic ""LIFEFORCE"" with it's apocalyptic chaos & it's pure originality. The end of the world wouldn't be something you could understand! It would be crazy confusion! ""unDEAD"" is a chaotic laugh-fest!"
2,Sub Par Zombie Stuff,"Fans of the Zombie genre will be entertained for the most part (or at least the first half). The film has a bit of style and the effects are good most of the time, but there's mot much here that we haven't seen before. I mean, we're running out of ways to kill zombies folks!Anyhow, the film makers at least try to up the ante by tacking the sci-fi/aliens twist into the story, but it's just not that interesting. And speaking of not that interesting, the characters are not fleshed out at all, and you never end of caring for any of them."
1,very misleading,"the cover is pretty good the story if you read the back don't say much. all the reveiws is misleading, as you watch this film it is pretty damn good in the first half but as you get further in the film it starts to go in a very horrible direction. basically the aliens were totatlly uncalled for. but it just went in a different direction from every other zombie film where they're saying the aliens were the cause of the zombie infestation. thats the only difference other than that dont waste your money just watch a romero film. you'll be a little more satisfied"
2,"""I'm having a turd of a day.""","Like a strange mixture of MARS ATTACKS! and RESIDENT EVIL II, UNDEAD is too silly, smug and disjointed to be enjoyed by the serious horror fan.The first five minutes are the best with a quick character introduction and also getting right into the meteor shower that turns the living humans into flesh eating zombies. After the zombies show up is when things start getting sillier and sillier. Example: the main guy is being attacked, in his home, by zombies from the front and the back so he lowers his head then raises his pistols and shoots in two directions at once like he was Christian Bale in EQUILIBRIUM and if that's not bad enough he then jumps in the air, flips upside down, jams his spurs (!?) into the wall above the doorway and literally swings back and forth shooting zombies.If that and lots of CGI effects sounds cool to you then by all means check it out, but I have no desire to ever see it again."
4,An Alien Zombie Australian Comedy GEM!,"I loved this movie! Where to start? It artfully combines the best qualities of some similar films--the alien invasion paranoia of Signs, the ending from Jeepers Creepers 2, the claustrophobia of all good zombie flicks, and the horror/humor from the Evil Dead trilogy (not to mention a little Close Encounters alien-awe). If you like Australian humor and zombie films, you should find this one to be entertaining, intelligent, and well done. The viewer never knows where the film is going next (even one character comments on this!) as it keeps re-inventing itself. The acting is great (I love the lead actress's eyes!) as is the production and effects. I hoped Shaun of the Dead would be this good! Bravo!"
3,Interesting movie,"Undead is a movie that starts in a happy little town. But things turn for the worst. It does have zombies. They were people infected with a disease from meteors. This movie also has a twist involving aliens, UFO's, and other strange events. Is definately a good movie for Sci-Fi/horror mix watchers. The ending though was simply amazing in my opinion."
2,What Is Going On?,"This movie had one of the most confusing and baffling storyline I have ever seen. The whole movie is an chinese riddle wrapped in a enigma. Besides a ridiculous plot, this movie did have potential to be a good zombie flick. It had really good special effects and some real clever death scenes. The zombie make-up and effects were top notch. Overall, I liked the zombies and the gore, but the plot and storyline derailed this movie before it ever got started. Even after the movie was over I was still comfused over what I did and watched for the last 2 hours. If your like me and love zombies and gore, its worth waisting 2 hours of your time. If you like well-written plots and storylines don't even come within 15 feet of this DVD."
1,AVOID!!!,"This was terrible, awful, no good, no fun, TOTALLY STUPID TRASH!!!!!! I thought it would be one of those hybrid (horror + comic) zombie movies but no, it was just really, really bad. Horrible effects, worse acting, stupid, pointless plot. Just avoid this thing like you would avoid a rotting zombie!"
1,Can't watch,"You will not be able to playback this HD movie via the Amazon.com website, or download it to your Amazon Unbox Video Player, or playback / download it to your TiVo.You will only be able to playback this movie on your Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Roku or other Amazon Instant Video HD compatible devices."
2,THIS IS NOT UNDEAD! IT IS DEAD!!!!,"I rented this DVD before I bought it and this movie started out as a good Zombie movie. I thought to myself this would be a another George R. writer and director, but boy was I wrong!! The more I watched of this movie, the stupidier this movie got!! (if stupidier is a real word.)Watch out if you want to buy this one. Aliens and undead zombies don't mix in this combo. Somethings don't make a whole lot of sense, and lots of questions go unanswered. The only thing going for this movie was the Special F/X, because the story line Sucked!!! Rent before you buy! You come out cheaper!!!"
4,"Flying Zombie FIsh, all I have to say",This movie is excellent. If you have seen Dead Alive you know what you are getting into. There is even a story here which is a suprise. You dont expect much going in but you will be suprised. It is not a 100 million dollar epic but the effects are good and you will not be disappointed. It is tounge in cheek for the most part but it works.
4,Wow. An unexpected hell of a horror/sc-fi movie.,"I rented this movie and I'm soon going to buy it. I am VERY picky with horror movies. I hate the Resident Evil movies(Damn Paul Anderson. The worst writer/director of all time). I hate horror remakes(How does anyone like these pieces of crap?). ANYWAYS, if you like Peter Jackson's Dead Alive or Bad Taste you will like Undead. The directing in this movie reminded me a little of Peter Jackson's directing. Undead doesn't have the same ol' zombie scenario which is awesome. If you're like me and love gore and hate MOST of the generic(and mostly PG-13) horror movies coming out now days. Rent or buy Undead. You will not be dissapointed. I liked this move better than Land of the Dead(C'mon Romero, you can do better!!!)."
4,Zombies - Aliens - And Gore!,I have to say this movie was not to bad. It reminds me of peter Jackson Bad taste. It's somewhere on that level. It has meteors bombing this small Australian Town and turning them in to zombies. Then the aliens enter the picture and chaos has just taken over. They put a wall trapping all the people and they begin picking the towns people off one by one. I would tell you more but that would give away the plot. The gore and zombie action it pretty dam good for the budget they had to work with. Do not expect Land of the Dead but it better than most of the low budget zombie movies out their. I give 3 stars but just on effort alone I gave it four. I say check it out you will be surprised
3,"Funny, campy way to take your mind off things....","Found this one in a 5 dollar bin and watched it yesterday. And I was pleasantly surprised. It was a fun hour and a half.The story is creative and not what I thought it was going to be, with the little twist at the end. The acting was B movie at best, but that is part of the charm. I liked all of the funny, fancy gun play throughout.The special effects and the makeup are also part of the movie's overall charm. You could tell that the movie was produced on a limited budget, but it all seems to fit to make it entertaining.It kind of reminded me of the first time that I saw ""The Evil Dead"" in a theater in the 80s. It's funny, has some memorable characters and a fair share of gross (but comical) moments. The fishing boat scene alone is memorable enough.Don't expect too much and you will probably enjoy it."
3,"good, not great","i first heard of this in Dreamwatch magazine. They gave it a good review, and i immediatley wanted to see it. Great sounding plot, but when I saw it months later it was a mediocre movie. 3.5"
3,It was not that bad...,"...well it has its ups and downs. The hillbilly guy is pretty cool, and somehow he has guns that rarely run out of ammo. Anyway, the movie started getting weird with the whole alien thing and the people floating in the sky. It was pretty entertaining and not boring, the only thing is some ideas failed to deliver, and by trying to somewhat different the movie just got plain weird. I don't regret buying it, I've seen some really horrible ""zombie"" movies, and this certainly is not one of them. I rate it 3.5 stars. I'm glad I added it to my collection, although it is not spectacular, it's not bad either."
3,Missing a couple of ingredients...,"Let me start by saying that this was a really fun movie to watch. Take some Living Dead (Return of, not Night of the) and mix in a little Night of the Comet and you essentially have a batch of Undead.Secondly, Felicity Mason is exceptional as the beauty queen/disenchanted townie/heroine.What is it missing? Six String Samurai.The entire time I'm watching this movie, I'm thinking how terribly uncool the character of Marion is. Throw in a hint of Lance Mungia's Buddy and I think there would be a much more raucous good time to be had by all.A good movie, but it's no Dead Alive (Braindead)."
1,"Watch out! Zombies! Oh wait, they're not zombies anymore","This movie was kinda stupid, the beginning was all thriling and boring, and the characters were really boring, the girl cop barely did anything, zombies were everywhere and she had a gun, but she didn't do anything, she just stood there. None of those 6 people got killed by the zombies, except for the big dude with the hat on at the ending. At first people turned into zombies by meteors, after that everyone who tuened into zombies turned back into regular people, but then all of the sudden, an infection spread and turned people into zombies again. Stuuuupid! We don't see how the big guy looks without his hat. Not even scary, just stupid."
1,Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage!,"This movie was the biggest disappointment... Where to start.I thought this was supposed to be a good zombie flick in the tradition of the Romero Trilogy, or at least along the lines of 28 Days Later, Resident Evil, etc..No such thing! This is a ridiculous spoof of a movie, with an incredibly stupid alien (yes, little green men)plot. The effects are totally ridiculous with some CGI that look as if they were put together using a Commodore 64. Acting is actually alright but the plot is so useless and weak that this apparent talent get totally wasted.Go ahead and watch it but be forewarned....."
1,UNDEAD SHOULD BE CALLED BORING!!!!!!!!,Undead fails on acting and the story was boring and it dragged too much!!!!!! The beginning of the movie was cheesy and even the music was cheesy!!!!!!! Please stay away from this zombie movie its not worth your time or even worth the money to rent it either!!!!
2,Only---ONLY If You're A Complete Zombie Geek,"Don't feel bad...I'm a bit of a zombie geek myself. This movie still didn't have much for me though. 2.5 Stars maybe, but definately not 3.Typical zombie flick, tongue-in-cheek humor and gore-o-plenty. Hot chick, big hillbilly hero---wait...big hillbilly hero? Yeah...it didn't work out so well.Expect this one to start off fun----get really really sluggish in the middle----and then finish off pretty strong.Not such a bad film considering it was probably low-budget...but it was the middle of the film that gets it such a bad rating. I'm telling you though...this one ends with a whopper....whatever the hell a ""whopper"" is....This one's a RENT...and that's only if you're one of the aforementioned geeks."
2,What?!?,"I can see how this movie could be compared to early Sam Raimi movies but the difference is Raimi did it well and of course there is Bruce Cambell. This movie seems kind of like Evil Dead 2. It tries to be funny and scary. It does have its moments, but it is too all over the place. It just becomes a more ridiculous series of events that dont really work together or at least arent explained very well."
3,Standard Zombie Movie. Not sure if thats good or bad though.,"As the title said, has all the elements of a standard zombie movie. Buckets of splatter, exploding heads, cheesy acting, paper thin characters, and a plot that would make even Snoop Dog think you're high.Its one part Dawn of the dead, one part Shawn of the dead. A double helping of cheese (...of the dead)Sorry couldn't resist.Though I do suggest ""bar rules.""That is, a 3 drink minimum to enter.Otherwise you may not like it..."
3,2 background errors,"Quite apart from the implausibilities that others have commented on, there are 2 incongruities in the background. The first is in the opening scene in a bank in Berkeley. The window says Savings and Loan?? This is an American term. As far as I know, it is never used in Australia. The equivalent Aussie term, which came from the British, is Building Society. Remember that the movie is explicitly set in Australia.The second is when the plane crashes and the police and fire brigade arrive. One of the cop cars is a black and white cruiser, just like in the US. Australia doesn't use such cars."
2,what this supposed to be a comedy?,"I don't understand? I thought I was going to rent this movie and at least get a somewhat exciting night. I've thought about watching it again just to be sure about what I saw, but I can honestly say that the first time around was pretty bad. The music was terrible, the acting was sickening, and the scene was more like a carnival going every which way. This could've been a worth while movie but it just basically turned out to be a sideshow. I'm left with the feelings of not knowing if this was supposed to be funny or horrific?"
1,UNDEAD,"Undead Who in the world would come out with a great title for a movie that did not even make any since. My sister brought me this movie, I looked at her like she lost her mind, after watching it. What was up with the cast? The all act like they were in shock and couldn't budge. And what was up with the aliens, that took the movie into another spin all together. But if you just are bored and have nothing to watch this movie is just for you."
2,Sub-par zombie flick tries too hard,"This film was pretty bad. I'm a huge fan of this genre, and this movie was meant to be a throwback to older zombie/horror flicks, but I can find none of the elements which made those movies so great in this one. It's plot is off-the-wall, but not in an interesting way --- rather, in a nonsensical way. Visually, this movie was pretty good, and that was its only redeeming feature. The dialogue was horrible in most parts, and was for the most part laughable, but again, not in a good way. In the making-of video, the writer/director/producer whatever says he wanted the score to be more action/adventure than horror; but to be honest though, it sounds more like ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" (no joke). This was one of the worst aspects of the film in my opinion, and it alone would have ruined the whole movie for me if the rest of it had not been pretty bad as well."
1,"They should have called it ""DEAD""",This movie was terrible. Whoever called this film a classic must be very easily entertained. What's with the people hanging in mid-air? What's with the rain? What's with the aliens? Where did the zombies come from? Why were the zombies still there after the aliens left?This is a classic 'the editor should have been fired' film.
1,d-sink mat,Wouldn't recommend. The coating comes off and the steel rusts. This occured in the first year we had it. Now searching for a new one.
4,Product is as described,"This sink grid arrived very quickly and is exactly as described, its a tighter fit than the previous one I owned so it sits higher up from the bottom of the sink than I expected. It seemed odd at first but Ive grown used to it. It was pricey but they all are. Last Blanco grid lasted me a decade so well worth the investment."
4,Good Movie,"great early period of young actors. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey. The work together as ""saddle pals"" do. With ward bond to keep the action on the lighter side."
4,Replacement tires,"I have yet to use these, but from what I have seen these are great on carpet. Will know more later."
3,Rolling in Rai and Ragga,"Not your run-of-the-mill Algerian Rai. This is more of a project in brining the Rai and other mediums together -- particularly that of the Ragga (or Raga, depending on which continent you're reading this from). The eclectic fusion of carribean rap & rhythms and the sensual Algerian vocals create a genre that is separate from simply just the one or the other. Amazigh Kateb, Gnawa Diffusion's leader, tries to bring his two backgrounds together -- His Arab heritage and his exposure on multicultural levels living in France. You may not understand the lyrics but his voice evokes very basic and solid emotions. The music also differs from the modernized Rai, which recently have a tendency to be overproduced. This album, Gnawa Diffusion's most recent release, once again reaches back to roots of both the Rai and Ragga genres and brings them together."
3,World's BEST pain relief in World's DUMBEST container!,"This stuff is indispensable for burns. Unfortunately, the dispenser is ridiculously inappropriate. You will probably NEVER get all of the product out of the bottle. But you won't know for sure until you can't GET anymore out of it, because it makes no noise when you shake the bottle and you can't see into it. It is a fairly thick gel and the squeeze bottle is very hard to squeeze. After a few uses, I have to HIT the bottle HARD against my palm to get anything out of it - a pain in itself and a real nuisance when you are in a hurry - like when you have a BURN!! This product package calls out for redesign. A pump bottle, A tube. A wider mouthed non-squeeze bottle. a jar. ANYTHING BUT THIS D*****D squeeze bottle. I have called the company, but the customer service lady said it was just perfect. I am writing this review so that perhaps the manufacturers will do something about this situation."
1,Not much information,I was looking for a book with details of the furniture produced during this period both to learn more about the style and for inspiration for my own creations. This book had only general descriptions of the types of wood and the types of things made with it. The photographs are low quality and few. A large portion of the book is devoted to documenting all the individuals who made furniture in the Charleston area but there are not any examples of their work identified in the book. By far the best thing about the book is the picture on the cover.
5,This was a gift item.,This item was a gift and the recipient seemed very pleased to have received it since it was on a request list.
1,Cheap thin plastic. Buy heavy duty one,"This ripped in the first week of ownership. I believe I should have purchased the more expensive one, especially since the trike is stored outdoors. I would prefer a Motorcycle type fabric one since it can handle outdoor conditions. This cover should only be used to keep dust and debris off. But why not save money and just get a sheet of plastic.Very disappointed."
1,DISSAPOINTED,ORDERED THIS FOR MY SCHWINN 26' TRIKE AND WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH QUALITY (ripped on applying to bike) when i notified manufacturer received no satisfaction. bought a sturdy cover for less than half price from Tarps plus.
3,Too small,"I loved this cover (fabric, qualitiy) but it was way to small for my 35"" Meridian trike. I ended up getting a large tarp instead."
4,I love the hi-lo mix,"Jim McManus--he's known as Jim in my house--is my favorite type of writer. Damn smart, funny, not afraid to make liberal use of Dante, and equally unafraid to write ""low"", too. In fact, one of my favorite parts of this awesome book was Jim's quoting of his little daughter at opportune, and not so opportune, moments: ""Good girl, Dat!"" Jim hit this poker thing long before anyone outside of the once-secret world of Texas Hold 'Em, and has written a layered, intelligent, highly entertaining work of narrative nonfiction. The only flaw, in my opinion, is the last chunk where Bad Jim emerges in full flower in a strip club. He is trying to complete the parallel, I realize, between himself and the late Ted Binion, whose trial he follows, again, in parallel, as he plays in the World Series of Poker. But to me, that fell flat; and his editor obviously let him get away with the artistic flourish that mars an otherwise freakin' brilliant book. The point of all this? I could not put it down."
2,Narcissistic Gonzo Lite,"I bought this book hoping for the atmospherics of the World Series of Poker plus insightful coverage of Ted's Binion's murder & the subsequent trial. That stuff can be found, but for the most part the book is a cut-rate Hunter S. Thompson knock-off primarily focussed on the author's fascination with himself. Do you want to learn detailed minutia about 4 or 5 prior generations of McManus's? It's there. Are you interested in all the intimate details of the author's tawdry behavior in casino lounges? It's there. If you caught the guy on one of the episodes of the WSP on ESPN, you already know more about this pompous lunkhead than you need to (the ""You called with a jack high?"" episode -- yup, he's the one). I recommend instead Alvarez's ""The Biggest Game in Town."" Somewhat outdated, but at least that guy can write."
2,"Long winded, Tiring.","When the author decides to stick to one subject the book isnt bad. But going off on multi-page tangents that add little to the story really gets tiring. The WSOP related stuff was good, the murder stuff was ok, the other 150 pages are just excruciating. Unfortunately for the reader they are all entertwined so to get one you have to go through all.IMHO, I thought the author was trying to copy Alvarez's (Biggest Game in Town) style, but where Alvarez would go off on a paragraph or two to fill in a story, this author would go on for pages."
1,An article (or two) trying hard to be a book,"Jim McManus' experiences playing in the WSP as a long-shot were riveting and would have made a wonderful magazine article. His coverage of the Binion trial, as well, would have made a good article. But instead of taking the prudent course and publishing them thus, McManus ties the two together on the premise of a number of absurd, overwritten parallels between poker and murder, interweaving pages upon pages *upon pages* of irrelevant subtext about his own life, self-destructive tendencies, family history, and wonderful, wonderful (am I sick yet of hearing about how wonderful she is?) and forbearing wife, Jennifer.Mc Manus' editor should have been demoted for allowing the number of divergent, run-on pages (chapters, even) that detracted from the two interesting main storylines. All wrapped together as the book is, it doesn't make for good reading unless you know which 60% to skip."
4,Good read--especially the scenes from the poker table,"The best parts of McManus' book are by far the scenes he depicts at the poker table. He's a journalist who makes it to the final table at the WSOP and lives to tell about it, so if you enjoy reading well-written pieces about Texas hold'em, you'll like the book.McManus' style is easy to follow and his honesty is compelling. I especially enjoyed his accounts of the other WSOP competitors and his feelings toward them during play--hilarious and so true!About half the book is spent on an account of the Ted Binion murder trial, and for me, things slowed down at that point. I would have rather the two separate stories find their way into two separate books.That's my lone beef about Positively Fifth Street, however. All-in-all I liked it. If you're a poker fan, I'm betting you'll like it too."
2,"Too much murder, not enough poker...","As another reviewer said in his 1-star review of this book, the sections on poker are excellent but they are buried inside of seemingly endless chapters on Ted Binion's murder, the author's grandparents, and all kinds of other nonsense. While those subjects could possibly be fascinating, McManus isn't nearly good enough as a writer to make them interesting. So what we're left with is a highly-compelling description of the 2000 WSOP for about 1/3rd of the book and then 2/3rds garbage.Best avoided if you're looking for a poker book."
2,Disappointing,"What disappointed me most about this book was the writing, which I would consider mediocre at best. If it hadn't been written by a journalist/reporter, I would have been less disappointed. But to think, the author has previous writing experience! I wouldn't have guessed it by this book."
5,"A terrific look at the world of poker, and I don't even play","Not knowing a straight from a royal flush, I can't really say what drew me to this book. But I picked it up, flipped through a few pages in the middle and again at the end, bought it, and never regretted it.McManus initially planned to write an article for Harper's when he went to Las Vegas to cover the World Series of Poker - and somehow it expanded into this utterly engaging nonfiction book that includes strippers, murder, sex, gambling (duh), drugs...well, why not? It's Las Vegas, after all. In 'researching' material about the world of gambling for his article, McManus enters the competition - and damn near wins!A delicious inside look into a world that 99% of us will never see and can barely imagine - and then there's that cheetah..."
1,Terrible,"I truly don't understand the fuss made about this pretentious and very awkwardly written book. It's really awful and unbelievably self-indulgent. If you want stories about poker told with some elegance I suggest the works of Alvarez (Biggest Game), Holden (Big Deal), and Konik (Telling Lies). This one is a complete mess."
2,Too long...Much too long,"This book has some good parts, but it's much too long for what it is. McManus tries too hard at times, and ends up writing too much about the unimportant. One thing that surprised me is that half of the book is about the death of Ted Binion and the whole scandal surrounding it. McManus makes the book too personal at times. It's almost like a journal, and although he might care about his own hourly activities, we don't. We also don't care about his family and his children. A good editor could have made this book much better. How sad. Better stick with the poker McManus, because you're not much of a writer."
2,A disappointment,"I had hoped for much more. The author has A LOT of first-rate, first-hand material to draw on, but gets bogged down early in IMAGINING the Binion murder (the writing is ridiculously inane at times) There is also too much ""textbook"" filler and clutter about the great game of Texas Hold Em that one will enjoy far more in A. Alvarez's classic (Alvarez's writing is better than McManus's by a factor of five). But the Good Jim/Bad Jim stuff is fun, and will make you laugh. I also enjoyed the author's narrative from the final table at the WSOP, though at times it inexplicably bogged down. This book could have used a strong, rock-em-sock-em editor. It is hardly the classic some people here think it is. And that's a big disappointment because the author had the ""nuts,"" as they say in Hold Em, to write that classic. He just failed to deliver."
5,Enthralling Inspirational Drama,Enthralling. I couldn't put it down. One with just a passing interest in poker is likely to become obsessed with the game of skill.
4,Positively Fifth Street,"I loved the book, but when I searched for it on Amazon, I did not see the unabridged version. Since its purchase, I found out it's available and I would have preferred to have bought it instead. The 3 CD abridged version does not contain all the anecdotes my friends have been telling me they read or heard in the unabridged version. Why don't you have the unabridged version at Amazon, or why did your search engine not find it?"
3,"Poker good, murder story just ok","Poker account was interesting, I already knew the story being told in the account of the Binon murder and was not as interested in this portion of the book."
3,Overplayed Hand,"Being a poker player, I had heard all the positive press on this book and was looking forward to it. Frankly, I was disappointed. Too much about the author, not enough about Ted Binion or the World Series of Poker. It was sort of like the author didn't know which book he wanted to write. It gets really draggy when he talks about himself. I think the positive press on this book is more a function of the time in which it came out rather than the book itself; poker is ""the new black"", and trendy right now. 5 years ago this book would have been completely ignored. There are better books on the subject."
3,Poker? I don't even know her.,"On the jacket a reviewer says this book contains some of the best sports writing you can read. I agree totally. And unlike some of the other reviewers, I did enjoy the sections on the Ted Bunion murder trial (this past month, the conviction of the woman involved was overturned). However, I felt it was poorly edited. It just didn't flow. And finally, I think we are all in agreement that the reader could have done with a lot less of his person life and upbringing."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I was skeptical when i first noticed this book. I skimmed through it and still wasnt sure. But when i actually purchased it and started reading it, i got into it. Alittle uninteresting at first but when i got to the part where he describes his experience at the WSOP i couldnt put it down!! A well put book when suspenful poker action ...A must read at an inexpensive cost!"
4,"Not bad, but...","McManus is a great writer. The book covers everything from his experience as a finalist in the World Series of Poker to the death of Ted Binion. Now, as a writer/journalist, I love anything written by someone like McManus. But there are several chapters I skipped because I didn't buy the book to learn about the author's childhood, and, by the end of the book, I knew enough about his wife and life that I skipped the final (or last two) chapters.Still, the book is recommended because you get to follow the author's progression from reporter covering the WSOP to a player finishing fifth in the tournament."
3,Could have been 5 stars with better writing!,"I had a difficult time getting through this book. Mainly because McMannus's writing style jumps around from topic to topic and some things are presented fast with a lot of street slang thrown in. Had it been written better I would have given it a full 5 stars because the material in the book is great.There is an awful lot of fascinating information about the big poker tournament and playing poker in general. Additionally, you can better understand the lure and excitement that drives people to mostly throw away their money almost on a whim at some of these tournaments."
4,Author's holdem knowledge in doubt,"The title is a blatant ""tell""regarding the author's holdem acumen.""Fifth Street"" is a stud term,any holdem player worth his salt knows the last community card is called the river."
4,This book has it all,"If you lobe Vegas, Poker, Murder mystery trials, or big personalities...then this book is for you."
5,A view from the table.,"Positively Fifth Street provides two interesting story lines in one book. First; the trial and background to Ted Binion's murder sets the stage for the author's visit to Las Vegas. Along the way, he enters a satellite to win a seat for the 2000 World Series of Poker. His wonderful run at the tournament lands him a seat at the final table. One feels the tension of playing the ""big one"" as the reader rides the author's highs and suffers his lows. It is a very entertaining book as the reader will see the dark side of Las Vegas gambling community and the shady history of the Binion family. But far and away the chapters on the poker tournament are the best. If you love poker, you'll love Positively Fifth Street."
1,Save your money,I generally love reading any book regarding gambling. This book is the exception. I can't even finish the thing because he's SO boring. He rambles on and on about things that aren't relevant. I spend more time skipping pages than I do reading them.
1,14:59 and counting...,"I'm somewhat confused as to how this current ""retro-techno-electro-disco"" band wagon morass can be considererd ""forward-thinking"" EDM??? The last time I checked, retro meant the opposite of forward.I ""cut my teeth"" on those types of ""old skool"" genres several years ago and while they were fun, inspiring and sounded daringly original at the time, they now come off as hollow, dated, and ultimately insipid. Sadly, it seems as if everyone is out of ideas these days whether it be in the mediums of music, film, literature and the like.With this, his contribution to the OS compilations (from Bedrock, no less), Fair attempts far too many mood, key and tempo changes and the mix skids off the decks as a result.I'm awaiting the return of house music which offers the listener a bit more ""mind-candy"" and which features depth, atmosphere and more highly stylized production values. It was a sad day, indeed, when the DJs traded their bongos for Casios..."
3,Don't Rely on the CD,"The accompanying CD with this book only covers 4 out of the 10 chapters. There are no recorded examples for the early chapters (if you're a complete beginner) or the later chapters on minor scales, contrary motion, thirds, sixths and double thirds (if you're more advanced). Be aware therefore, that you will have to be able to read all the examples given in notation and work them out yourself. The Cd is therefore, a token gesture."
1,Waste of money,This was a total waste of money. The pendant started losing its color in a week's time.
3,Om Pendant,"I was a bit surprised when I received a very Large pendant. I guess I was hoping for something more feminine and smaller, not large and heavy.Perhaps listing the size would have been helpful."
2,Beautiful but Kind of Crap,"I bought this and loved it, but after about a week the whole thing started tarnishing and no amount of polishing or cleaning made it better. Now I basically have a blakened piece of junk that is too ugly to wear. If I had to do it over again, I'd try coating the whole thing with a clear nail polish or some other kind of clear sealant to keep it from ruining like that."
4,It's Small but Sexy!,I was a bit disappointed by the size of it. But it serves it's purpose by being small
2,Dissapointed,The pendant is nice however the pewter wrap around kind of ruins the entire design. It does not go with the center design. I think it would look better with a slightly tarnished silver look. Pewter is just too dull for this design and the necklace does not work well with the pendant either.
4,Fact or Fiction,I read this book in two days. It's rather short and compelling enough to keep you interested throughout. The writer does leave you wanting more and a lot of the big issues are not thoroughly flushed out. The one question I would like answered is whether this book is fact or fiction. The publisher promotes this work as a novel but I am certain it is not. I would be happy to recommend this book to friends. It's a good book for discussion.
3,Fatima deserves better,"I was tremendously excited when this book arrived at my door step. I had read about it online and I expected an intense thriller revolving around the Third Fatima secret. In reality, the book bored me. The majority of the novel retells the narrator's criminal past, from petty thief in Ireland, to a mob-connected document thief that gets involved with protecting Juan Peron and Watergate. Fatima is mentioned, yes, but too briefly and I thought the end was rather anticlimactic.Furthermore, the author touches on rumors regarding the Vatican's Nazi connections, the alleged murder of Pope John Paul I and the Vatican conspiracy to prevent the Third Secret from being revealed.Overall, I think this book has potential. But I think it needs at least another 100 pages to fully explore the subjects it touches."
2,Davinci Code a la Fatima,"AMDG must harbor a personal grudge against the SSPX to mention in particular this certain group of courageous Catholic Traditionalists, not being a member of this group myself I must nonetheless set AMDG straight that it is no secret that every Traditionalist and many non Traditionalist Novus Ordo Catholics and clergy realize the Fatima cover up consiracy. But anyway, I thought the book was a waste of time and my question to Mel Gibson if he's listening, Do we really need this fact fiction fantasy put on film? You had the priviledge of meeting Sr. Lucia of Fatima so why not honor Our Lady with a beautiful film version of the REAL story?"
3,smells like mom's bath...,but I don't notice any exfoliating action. It is good old Dove soap. Just like mom used to buy.
5,great for fishing kayak,"The anchor seemed a little smaller than I was expecting but I did want one small and as lightweight as possible for use on a fishing kayak. My brother and I have been known to paddle miles up rivers and bay estuaries where current can be a force to recon with and it's important to keep the gear loadout to a minimum. However, the anchor is a necessary evil for being able to hold your position in current and get some good fishing in. We both got these anchors at the same time and have used them in various bodies of water over the last month.So far, this anchor has never let us down. Even when the current has been quite strong, it has never budged. I wouldn't go anywhere fishing without it now.I would have preferred a choice of colors and a longer rope with a float at the end but neither have been necessary.For a fishing kayak, this one is it!"
4,Good for size!,"Got it and it works pretty good for it's small size, takes up very little room in storage areas. Ditched the storage bag as it takes too long to get it out and hard to fit everything back in. I'm gonna put a quick connect and a float on the end so I don't loose it in the water."
4,PWC anchor,"Love that the anchor comes in a bag, but wish it had a buoy to let it float while you went out riding so you did not have to take the anchor out everytime"
3,Good book,Iloved this bok. Oeming is a GOD. The editorial is incorrect. The movie is being PRODUCED by John Woo. Not directed by. It is directed by Paul Hunter.
1,Bulletproof Junk.....,"I was mainly drawn to Bulletproof Monk because John Woo, one of my all-time favorite action-movie directors, is helming an adaptation starring Chow Yun-Fat. Woo also wrote the introduction. Along with Mike Avon Oeming's art, that's about all that's worth a look.The story seems to be patterned after kung-fu movies, but the creators seem to forget that the fun of a kung-fu flick is NOT the dopey plot, or the deep meditations of the tortured characters, but the KUNG-FU. Seeing 2 VERY short action sequences in print is not a thrill....The characters are all forgettable, and I didn't feel for any of them in the slightest. My sole enjoyment in this waste of money came from the numerous self-congratulatory essays from the various people involved with the book. They practically break their arms patting themselves on the back..You'd think you were reading about Catcher in the Rye, instead of an overrated amateur-hour piece of junk. Pass at all costs!"
4,Terrific,The instructions were so easy to follow and it was very easy to assemble. The lawn mower works great and was the cheapest one around. The delivery and the exchange was the easiest I've ever done. Thanks again. Will definitely find other items to order.
1,Keep adjusting,"This mower has been nothing but adjustments from the start, and it still doesn't cut.It takes at least two passes over any type of grass to get an even cut. On thin, tall grass it takes four to five passes.I have tried every adjustment on it including sharpening the blades and nothing helps.I'm going to gas power mowers."
3,"Nice, but overpriced","I bought the 7-blade reel mower with high expectations that were not met. The research that I did was tireless in trying to find the best mower for my bermuda/rye grass combination. It's perfect for cutting bermuda alone, but the rye grass remained looking uneven after 2 days. There were also problems with the cutting path. I found that I had to repeatedly go over areas more than once. I paid $...on a web site recommended by the manufacturer, but I later found the same mower for $... on another web site. I also tried very hard with no success to find a used one. I think I would not have minded the drawbacks if the price was not comparable with a highly rated gas mower that performs much better. Don't get me wrong, the mower is very lightweight and easy to use. But, I think I paid too much. If I can ever find a used one for around $..., I'll definetly pick it up as a backup to the gas mower."
1,Doesn't work,"The American Lawn Mower misses lots of grass when mowing. Instead of cutting neatly it pushes the grass over and only cuts some of it, leaving clumps of uncut grass behind. Shortly after purchasing this mower I had to buy a gas powered mower as this one just does not work. Save yourself the money and get a gas or electric powered mower."
5,"Excellent, but be careful with new yard","This mower is a dream to use! I just moved into my first house and order it from Amazon[.com] several weeks ago. It was a breeze to put together, took all of maybe 3 minutes. Finally mowed the grass for the first time last weekend. The first time was a bit difficult because the grass was over 1 foot tall, and I left the height adjustment at the lowest possible setting. I also did a little more mowing last night and it was extremely easy. You may want to rent a gas mower for your first cut if you're starting with a brand new yard in order to get everything down to size, but otherwise you'll love this purchase!"
4,Good mower,"The mower is designed for creeping grasses like bermuda. If you have fast growing and/or long grass, do not buy this product. It will not work well if at all on longer grass. As long as you are using it for what it is designed for it works flawlessly. The clippings can be left on the ground because they are not noticeable and provide nutrients for the ground so you don't need the bag attachment. The cut is very even and works the first time on low/short grass. It does not make much noise and is a really great workout. It is definitely worth the money."
3,Old Times,"I bought this reel lawn mower to cut newly installed zoysia grass sod. I cut grass with a similar mower as a boy, many years ago. One thing about this mower is that you really do get a workout, even for a small yard, especially if the grass gets too tall. As a general rule, I first have to cut the grass with my lawn tractor and then finish the cutting with the reel lawn mower. This mower works fine but the grass does have to be very short in order to get it to work well even with the mower at its tallest setting.The mower was delivered quickly and the assembly time specified was accurate."
2,The mower works.... sort of,"I already own a 20 inch reel mower. Because I have really thick zoysia, it tends to clog the mower. I thought buying a smaller 16 inch mower with more cutting edges would work better. In reality, the mower does a better job at cutting the grass, and the large rollers in the rear make the cut look even better. The problem I have is that when pushing the mower the handles fold down causing weakness. Too much of this causes the handles to finally break. The handle needs to be a loop in order to withstand the constant pushing."
4,"Excellent on St. Augustine, not so good for Bermudagrass.","My lawn is a mix of St. Augustine and Bermudagrass, depending on the sun/shade of a given area. This mower breezes through the St. Augustine, but jams up constantly on bermudagrass. Even immediately after sharpening it, I find that I have to mow the bermudagrass sections 6"" at a time and make 2-3 passes. Given a little extra time and some heave-ho, it gets the job done. The real downside to this back and forth is that the plastic brackets holding the rear roller failed. I replaced them with hollow square steel tubing, and haven't had any problems with that since.On the whole, I'm quite pleased, though a little surprised by the difficulty with this one specific grass.As an aside, I live 8 blocks from the gulf of mexico, and have had no problems with rust or corrosion of any kind from the salty air."
4,Does a good job cutting the grass!,"I was a bit skeptical about whether this would be a good product, but my husband mowed our small yard with it today and I am glad I bought it. I agree with other reviewers' who said that really tall grass or weeds will be left behind by the mower when the rest of the grass is the same height, but I think we'll just buy a gas powered trimmer for edging and dealing with any stragglers. Overall, this mower was easy to use and worked well and was so quiet!"
5,No more gas!,"I bought the Great States model 1415-16 mower from Amazon two years ago. The same company makes the Great States, American, and Scotts brands... You can't buy directly from Great States/American and Amazon has the best selection. From what I've read and experienced, buy the lightest mower with at least five blades. I'll tell you this. These aren't your father's reel mowers. Today's reel mowers are state-of-the-art. Once you buy one of these, you'll never go back to gas. The one I have can compete with any of the ""best"" gas-driven mowers on my street. It's easy to push, more gentle on the grass, and doesn't pollute. Best of all? No starting. No gas. No maintenance. I haven't had to sharpen the blades yet. This is one item I can recommend without reservation."
2,Which bermuda does it cut?,"I bought this mower for my bermuda lawn - skipping the 5 blade models for the 'bent grass' model. It's underperformed since day one. It's overly sensitive to the slightest bump or dip in the yard and constantly chokes on thicker (not taller) areas.One of the wheels also seems to catch from time-to-time, as if the gear inside the wheel isn't turning.I had one of the cheap 15"" reels and loved it - cut turf in WA and CT and even St. Augustine's in Houston. I sold it in AZ (no lawn) and regret it. I've stopped telling people about the merits of reel mowers - in case this is the new quality of the mowers being made."
4,works well,Works as advertised and we are really enjoying the peace and quiet are wonderful. Not having to run to the gas station before starting is also a joy.
4,Great Lawn Reel Lawn Mower,"I found this to be great mower. Please note that if your grass is high, as mine was, the initial mow will be difficult, but do not be discouraged. The next mows were much better. I can now mow at anytime without disturbing my neighbors, and it is better for the environment."
5,Great Oldie,"Decided to get this mower so I wouldn't have to bother with gas, wondering if I was going to get the thing started, having to get it serviced every year and so that I would get exercise naturally and hopefully have it for life. My yard isn't very large, but large enough that I did the front yard one day and the back another. I love this mower. It was easy to put together (and that's saying a lot for me),it gives me the exercise I wanted (60+ woman)and it does a beautiful job on the lawn besides helping the environment. Granted it has a difficult time mowing the thin weeds, but those are what I will dig up anyway and I occasionally have to reach down and take a twig out of the blades, but it's all worth it. Just try to pick up twigs from your yard before mowing and it should be a breeze."
5,Perfect purchase,"We moved back east, and that means we have a little postage stamp yard. I wanted: 1.) To get more exercise; 2.) Something quiet; 3.) Something safer for an inexperienced mower who's 12 years old; and 4.) Something that isn't too difficult to use. This product was a great purchase! My son can mow the grass just fine, he can push it without trouble. It cuts like a dream. It's actually really easy to push, not like the one I had as a kid! I love that all I have to do is rinse it off and put it in the shed... no gasoline, no mixing oil, no spark plugs and no worrying about my son. The only issue I have is that I have to use some needle-nose pliers to pull any grass and weeds out of the crevice between the blades and the wheels if the grass is a bit long. Otherwise it can't roll very smoothly. I'm very happy with this purchase!"
3,IT DOES THE JOB,"I have a small area of lawn to mow, and the problem I have is the mower doesn't cut very even. I find myself having to go over the same areas more than once, which becomes tiring. Also, the bag I purchased with the mower has two hooks, one small the other larger. I'm not sure how they're supposed to hang on the mower, it's a guessing game at best."
2,opinions,"I just concluded reading Gun's book - Eva Braun. The information was very weak, uninformative. Primarily I think he wrote this in order to express his own personal feelings and spin on how he viewed the key players in Germany from 1929-45. He keeps citing his sources, which leads me to think he needs to constantly show us how much research he has done, this conveys no confidence in his work, and questions the authenticity of it. The book has no depth, all information is on the surface. Without his personal opinions, it could have been 50 pages. Don't waste time reading this one its not worth the effort."
4,Worth Price,"Strong bulb for size; nice cord and connectors;also included: added ~ 8"" connector for running fixtures in series.Clips are cheese, but can run thin wire through them (barely) and then tie / chain on your own. [make fish eye and twist to secure to clips - can also use small gauge wire ties and such].Clips fit nearly flush to top of fixture and are not convenient to connect chains with hooks unless using some kind of wire method first.Needs reflectors of some kind unless in series with lots of plants -we used scrap thin sheet metal to reflect; and chicken wire to make sure our kitty and doggies don't mess things up."
5,barn red shower curtain,Just exactly what I was looking for!!! The color matches perfectly. The price was awesome.
1,WHAT A RIP-OFF!,I rate this toy a big fat 0. The description makes you believe this doll can stand and dance on her own. You have to hold the thing on top of her head the whole time and all she does is twirl around in a circle and play a song. I gave this toy 1 star because they had nothing lower. I am angry that I have to pay a return merchandise fee and return shipping fee. If amazon had done a better job describing this toy I would never had bought it. THIS TOY HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO OFFER!
2,Disney Dancing Cinderella,"I bought this doll for my daughter for Christmas. It was the only thing she asked for and wanted very badly. Only 1 week later it stopped working correctly and would only perform intermittently. At one point the music stayed on and would not turn off. My daughter was devastated. We were able to return the doll to ... for a full refund, but my daughter is still very disappointed."
4,Perfect for the Cinderella lover,This was a Santa gift for my 6 yr old and she absolutely loved it. The dolls spins either her shirt or her entire body based on what you press. My daughter played with this doll all day and preferred it over all her other Santa gifts.
3,"A good over-view, - but not much depth.","I think this movie is pretty good movie. I guess any movie can't give the depth on this I think it should. I found it interesting - yet lacking the depth I want. After 17+ years in 12-step - I see there is so much more to it all. And this movie is focused on the start of AA, it really isn't a biography on Bill W. And it doesn't mention that he is buried in Vermont (If that's important). Kind of short too for a movie. Well acted. Bill sure put his wife through a lot, and I think that part only scratches the surface. Many tell me - Bill belonged in SLAA too. Still - a pretty good movie. Scott M."
3,12stepper,This is a good start for those who are inclined to battle their demons. Good background on the founding of A.A. the the process of finding spirituality.
5,Bill & Bob--The Beginning,"It was very informative in seeing exactly how Bill W. got started in the program. It is always a treat when we can see exactly where a person has been, where they are now, and where they are going. I'm sure Bill had not intention of knowing that something so simple would turn out as big as it has. Everyone in the AA program should see this. Gives a different perspective on exactly how the program of AA got it's start."
4,My Name is Bill W,"An inspiring movie of human nature to fall to the depths of despair and manage against all odds to find a way back to a new and productive life. For anyone who has an alcoholic addition or lives with someone who is addicted to alcohol, I highly recommend this movie. This movie is a moving, heartwarming, genuine experience."
5,Mr Borchert (the writer) has done a magnificent job! - Well Done!,"This movie is ""The Gold Standard"" on any movie that deals with hope, fellowship and recovery.Simply, it is the best!Excellent work Bill!"
5,how AA was born,"James Woods and James Gardner's acting is superb as Bill W. and Dr. Bob who were the co-founders of Alcoholics Anonymous. This movie brings out all the emotions that one can experience. You will laugh and cry. If you ever have had a problem with drinking alcohol, this movie will give you hope to stop drinking."
4,My Name is Bill W.,"This could be a favorite of yours if you are:a) a James Woods fanb) a ""Friend of Bill W""I bought it for both reasons. James Woods gives a believableperformance as the real-life hero of many alcoholics todayas Bill W -co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous- in the 1930's.As a film, I think it is good; as a ""docudrama"" I think it leavesout some things that may leave one unsatisfied. Many AA's alreadyknow more of the history than is presented here. But in any casethis is a good film to watch, and If you are ""In the life"", A greatfilm to own."
5,Excellent,"Eye opening and accurate. Being involved with the recovery scene, I enjoyed the history of how AA began. This is an excellent movie for spouses of addicts to watch!"
4,Excellent film,An excellent film about the start of AA - fairly factual and totally inspirational. Glad i watched it and am sharing with friends.
5,Awsome !!!!,"As a recovering person of 21 years, the movie helped me get in touch with so many feelings. Mostly gratitude for what I have but also the feelings of hopelessness, shame, and despair. So very close to Bill's Story in the Big Book. I use it to show new people in recovery how it all started."
2,AA,"Some AA members consider this movie a valuable asset. I found it shallow. It was a pathetic Hollywood attempt to review the lives of those who began the search for an alternative to hospitalization and death for alcoholics. It was a nice try, but it didn't work, and the way it ended was like diving off a board into a dry pool."
4,Thanks for sharing,"Talking into a tape recorder and listening to yourself is better therapy. Plus, think of all the money you'll save on gas."
4,Still as Good as I Remember,"I saw this movie originally in 1989. I was glad to find it on DVD. I found it especially interesting that James Woods played the part as he was playing either rogue policmen or assassins in the 1980's. I remember James Garner in the ""Rockford Files"". The movie is a nice overview of how AA was started. The acting is well done and the story is touching. If anyone is even remotely interested or famliar with the AA story I would definitely recommend this as a good starting point."
3,Decent Film,"I'm not sure of the historical accuracy of this film, but it is a good film. It does a very good job of illustrating the addict's reality."
3,My Name is Bill,"An old AA movie. If you are interested in the founding of Alcoholics Anonymus a ""must have""."
3,All about prohibition,"Good information about the history behind the amendment as well as the causes of its repeal. If you want a short brief read about this time period, this book is for you."
1,Badly made High School Level Film,I like hockey and watched the trailer for this movie before I purchased it. I thought the trailer didn't look too bad. Boy was I wrong!!!! I figured it would be neat to own a movie that had a character in the movie with a similar name to my own. Thats the high light of this movie the cover art. I could not even finish this movie. Had to keep using the fast forward function. The only funny parts were of Sure Shot the hockey player. Everything else was filler. Save your money. This is a ZERO star movie.
4,Brilliant film!,"This movie defines so much about what I think relationships should be- Jesse and Celine don't have anything to hide because they are strangers who only have this one night. Its terribly romantic in the classical sense... you are pulling for them the entire time, you see their chemistry, and you really start to pull for them. This movie is a long conversation. It has no action whatsoever... so, if you really like movies that are character driven, be sure to pick this up. I would give this film 5 stars, but since I am reviewing the DVD version, I give it 4 because it has no extras! When will directors go back to their most excellent films and do commentaries for them? I have the same problem with the Singles DVD..."
5,Wandering a European City,"My wife and I were really amazed that a movie could capture so well the feelings, the sights, the rhythm -- even the smells, it seemed -- of the unique experience of wandering around an old European city, with nothing but time, little money, and someone you love. Watching this video is the next best thing to getting back there to do it again."
5,Before Sunrise,"This intelligent and unconventional tale of talky romance borrows something from the work of French auteur Eric Rohmer, but ""Slacker"" director Linklater--a master of meandering conversation--puts his own stamp on the character-driven drama with searching, tone-perfect dialogue. As they wander the streets discussing love and sex, history and politics, Hawke and Delpy make attractive kindred spirits whose youthful, sometimes argumentative exchanges really seem to echo real life. Despite the R rating, ""Sunrise"" is an ideal film for teens, as it captures a sense of life's wondrous possibilities."
4,"Touching, thoughtful if a bit talkie","This quiet, thought-provoking film--aimed mostly at 20-somethings who love to talk endlessly about the world and themselves and how the two fit together--actually ends up transcending its introvertedness and becomes a sweet, poignant story not only of one night spent together by two travelers, but of the human condition, of life and death, and of what it means to love. The two lead actors give very nuanced, subtle performances and invoke emotions without hystrionics. When you're in the mood for a 1.5 hour conversation about ""the meaning of it all"" from a youthful perspective, this film's the one to check out.I haven't seen the sequel yet, but I certainly plan to. It was apparently made 10 years later and shows the two characters--ten years later. Sounds intriguing to me. I really want to know what happened to them and how they look back on their night together."
5,""" Au revoir"" ""Later""","Thank god this movie is available on DVD. I bought it right here. Everyone else here stole my thunder, so I can only say what my favorite scenes are: - the opening scenes showing the train gliding through the European countryside - Celine sitting down across from Jesse and glancing at him... twice - Their first kiss on the ferris wheel at post-sunset(VERY romantic). - The 'telephone' conversation - Talking under the stars - Taking each others' picture - Saying goodbye. This movie contains the best goodbye kiss I've ever seen on film. When I first rented this movie, I tried to keep myself from watching it too often so that I wouldn't get tired of it. But it is really hard to get tired of this film."
4,"Very good, but not a master piece.","This is a very good movie, although sometimes I got myself watching the hours, because the movie is really slow paced.This is not a chick flick, but of course fans of only action movies will have a hard time going through this one here. But it's a solid piece of movie making, the chemistry between Hawke and Delpy is unbeliavable."
3,Dumb Tourist finds Hot CHick,Ethan hawke wanders europe like a total goon but comes across the beautiful Julie Delpy and they hit it off like a midget and an old guy.
2,i definetely did not like this movie,a movie for an audience of under 17. my 13 year old daughter loved it. what about the adults? any realy good movie for us?
1,WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!,"THIS MOVIE WAS HORRIBLE. EVERY SINGLE LITTLE DETAIL THAT PEOPlE FOUND ROMANTIC MADE ME FEEL LIKE BARFING! IT WAS FOR SURE THE MOST POINTLESS MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN. THE SECOND ONE IS EVEN WORSE! I WATCHED 5 MINUTES OF IT AND HATED IT. THE MAIN ACTRESS IS WAY TO UGLY AND THE ACTING IS BAD! I DON""T KNOW WHO WOULD WANT TO WATCH A MOVIE LIKE THIS. A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!"
5,A really special film,"I had always wanted to see this movie and finally rented it. It is pure poetry. Julie Delpy plays a wonderful, intellectual ""old soul"" while Ethan Hawke is perfect as a young, growing ""new"" one. They are so good together. I've carried this film around with me since, along with a feeling of hope and keen reminder that the world is wonderful place - full of beauty, pain, and love. I've been trying to find the soundtrack, but there doesn't seem to be one. The scene in the listening booth is truly great."
2,An interesting concept,But I didn't connect with the actors...it just didn't seem sincere or all it is cracked up to be to me.
2,Don't believe the hype.,"Haven't these people ever been on a good date? Because they ought to realize that this isn't one.Basically the movie switches back and forth between stilted intellectual monologues and badly improvised spontaneity. The monologues are unbelievably vapid, and it never feels like the characters are listening to each other, just waiting for their turn to speak.The improvised moments have the forced falseness that almost always comes from filmed improvisation.There's no feeling here, no passion, no chemistry. The only emotional depth came when they said goodbye, but so little had passed between them up to that moment that I couldn't be moved.I did hope the movie was building to some sort of exciting climax where they shave off Ethan Hawke's annoying goatee, but no such luck."
1,don't bother,"Now that Before Sunset is out, there's renewed interest in Before Sunrise. This movie is so shallow, tedious and boring that it should be allowed to die in peace. Unless you are predisposed to fall in love with Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy, you would be well advised to avoid it. As an infomercial by the Vienna Tourist Office, this is far more successful than as a movie. I can only suppose that those who like this movie have never spent a whole night just talking to and being with someone. Those who have will know how much more interesting that was than sitting through this is."
1,"Wien, the real star and the only star of this film","Having heard of this movie for a long time, I have waited to see it after my trip to Vienna. I was so happy I did. The movie was extremely boring and pretentious about two self-absorbed people. The simple rule for a romantic movie to work is that the characters have to be likable and hopefully they have great chemistry. This movie lacks both. I watched the entire boring thing because of Vienna. But even Vienna cannot save this dreadful film. For a great romantic movie in a beautiful European city, why not try David Lean's ""Summertime"". Yes, it is about a chance encounter between two strangers. Yes, it has a lot of talking. Yes, the last scene is also in a train station. But boy, what a difference!"
1,"How about ""Wake me at Sunrise""?","There couldn't be many movies more pedestrian, predictable and paint-by-the-numbers than this one.Gee, do you think he'll meet someone on the train? Think that palm reader will give them a reading? Will that poet write a poem for them? Will they have their obiligatory argument? Will they go just one scene with something original? Don't waste your time with this turkey."
1,Movie equivilant of hanging to death,"The depressiing and boring first encounter of two blathering people with bad teeth and no interesting stories to tell. This is one of the worst movies I've ever watched 20 minutes of before realizing that life is short and this was not time well spent. Even turning off the sound can't save you from the terrible pain that comes with this movie. They clearly can't get enough of themselves. If it was possible to talk, walk aimlessly, kiss and bore people to death they would do it. Mind you, they came very close.If you're hoping to become depressed, or looking for an alternative to a sleeping pill, by all means, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay far away from this total abomination of a movie."
1,Awful. Simply dreadful,"Not one frame of this turgid romance/travelogue is remotely believable. The pacing is insultingly plodding. Our luststruck couple pose before the unusual tourist attractions. And the French girl recites standard trevel guide blurbs in every case. In every case these pat travel guide spiels are much less painful than the utterly unbelievable claptrap that passes for romantic banter. In one case the boy pantomimes calling home to tell his parents about the girl. After this interminable and unendurable monologue, he requires her to do the same.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
1,Bo-o-o-o-o-oooooring!,"Geez, what a mistake! I looked at the score (4.5 ""stars"" - not bad) and bought the DVD. Watched one third of this movie with great hope to see some action. Nope. Not in this one. I fast-forwarded the rest, stopping at some points... still nothing. Obviously there is something missing... something that makes miles of film into a movie. The play is horrible (seems like some cheap real time show with teenagers). Unfortunately, cannot rate this with zero (or negative). That would do it..."
4,After Midnight.,"Make sure you view ""Before Sunset"" right after watching ""Before Sunrise"". Same actors 9 years later. These are a couple nice date night joints. Pour yourself a glass of wine and enjoy."
5,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:One of the best romantic movies ever made, Before Sunrise is brilliant in its simplicity: it has no comic pratfalls, no third act breakup, no sight gags, and no misunderstandings between the couple, just 100 minutes of two very interesting characters walking through a city and falling in love."
4,A Special Movie,"I usually avoid romantic movies. I detest the predictable beautiful and vapid man and woman, the unrealistic plot. But I liked this one. It is a romantic movie for people who hate romantic movies. The love is real in this one, and suprisingly moving, specifically at the end.Before Sunrise is the story of two young travelers (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) on a train who disembark in Vienna, Austria on a whim. The two talk about love and life while wandering the city at night. It is a good thing they were not in New York, or they would have ended up on the missing persons list. Vienna must be very safe.Before Sunrise is very romantic. As the night lengthens, the conversations become more interesting. At least some of their ideas will resonate with you. Some are so deep, they made me want to cry. The film is very well done. You feel as if you are just a fly on the wall observing this young couple. It is a very quiet, peaceful film, with no action sequences or even fighting."
5,This film captures the essence of romance,"What a magical experience it is to fall in love. ""Before Sunrise"" beautifully expresses the pain, the excitement, and the *feeling* of love. It proves that to find that elusive emotion of love, one must be willing to take risks and trust one's intuition. This film so eloquently illustrates that when one reaches the end of his or her life the things that matter the most are those magical and romantic moments that one has experienced. I encourage you to see this film with someone you deeply care about."
3,For you to read,"This film, like clowns, makes me both happy and afraid of humanity. I fear this movie like an aspiring Worlds Smallest Midgit who finds his twin in a vacent mall parking lot and has to come to grips with the fact that he is not the only one who is him. I am ""Jesse"", and his story and everthing is me. I love this movie as I love myself and Parisian women. I write this so that you may read it and want to watch that movie at 4 o'clock in the morning so that Before Sunrise you shall know me."
2,Good Looking but empty,"This is a movie that you expect to be poignant and ""deep"" but is actually sort of annoying.Maybe it has a couple of nice scenes , but the banter between the characters wasn't particulary clever or deep or anything ,just very basic and self absorbed, almost like a parody of how ""intelligent "" people must talk. Not a single thing in the movie made me give a damn about them being together, thera was no tension, no ache, no conflict of any sort.In the end is just good looking people talking and falling in love and trying to be smart and angsty and.....oh f off already!"
4,A Modern Ulysses,"All happened within a day, a modern Ulysses?There were de facto only two characters in this film, two youngsters who chanced to meet in Vienna and then they talked and talked, talking about life, about their parents' expectations and their reciprocal resentment, about friends and human relationships... about everything.What the director did was keep changing scenes, taking the audience on a beautiful tour in the whole town of Vienna interweaving each setting with a new local passerby or else a fortune-teller to make it look real. He did it, the viewers don't feel bored ( such a contrast to ""Anne Frank"" ). Needless to say, they are not intended for the children unless they sufficiently know about the ironies and humours of modern life.Recommended."
5,Before Sunrise,I love this story. I forget that it is acting because the actors are so relaxed and so real.
5,everything in a day,"a beautiful, simple, but poignant, love story that demonstrates the strong connections we can develop to one another in a short time. A lovely, remarkable story that captures eternity within a day."
2,Not a whole lot here unless you're going to Vienna!,"There just isn't much of a plot here. Boy meets girl on train, girl gets off train with boy & wanders aimlessly. A few nice shots of Vienna but there are travel-logs for this. Kinda boring unless you are a Julie Delpy fan and want to see her with all her clothes on."
1,Not as described,"What I wanted was a like new DVD, what i received was a DVD that had a photocopied label (and on the photocopy, there was a sticker from a rental place included, and text cut off)and a dusty DVD! Not happy."
1,"AWFUL, BORING MOVIE!",I just wanted to echo the negative reviews that have been posted so far. I saw no chemistry between the couple and the Ethan Hawke character really got on my nerves. It was a pointless waste of time watching two people (especially the girl) waste their whole evening and if I were the girl I'd have had to ditch him early on. He really seemed self-absorbed and needed to lighten up. I guess this stuff was supposed to be deep. But the dialogue seemed merely written by a shallow person imagining what depth might be and getting it wrong and sounding totally contrived.
2,You gotta be lonely to like it...,"Performances were OK, cinematography was fine, story was OK. Lacked sexual or emotional chemistry. He was an immature little boy by his own admission; she was a co-dependent perhaps but even so too good for him. What did these two find in each other?! Other than company to be walking around Vienna with? Everything she loved, he belittled or hated... the fortune teller, and the beautiful poem. The hell with him. They should have made the girl just want him for a romantic roll in the hay.I guess all the rave reviews come from women so desperate for a good romantic movie, they are easily impressed.I too would like to see Hollywood do more in the romance arena, even some adaptations of favorite romance novels, but alas ""BEFORE SUNRISE"" is not one of these masterpieces.Good, OK, worth seeing, but not worth the hype."
3,Good,"I like the hose and works fine. The only issue i have seen with it, can flip over and if i need to flip it over but only when the water to seem to be on. So, i get wet doing it. :-("
1,"Do not buy to use as ""sprinkler"" hose","Warning...I bought to use as a sprinkler hose for the side(s) of our house. Long and about 15'wide, completely flat too.... We are in your average neighborhood and are on public water. Water pressure is as it should be and have no issues with any other sprinklers. With the water on to the unit and nothing else in the house turned on and using water, the unit, at full length, sprays water about 2' high and about 1' to the left and right of hose.... That is at the side where the hose is connected, towards and at the end of the unit..... maybe spraying 1' up and inches to the left and right. Unit might be ok for soaker hose when wrapped around plants, etc. but i bought it for what it is labeled for, SPRINKLER HOSE. UGH.... Never had this problem with anything bought from amazon so I guess my only option is to return it and buy a different one or go to a local store so I am not waiting another week."
3,A little too long,"I have this model in the 30 foot and 50 foot lengths as well. I've noticed that by the time the water gets to the hundredth foot on this one, it lacks pressure and the hose easily collapses at the least kink or compression. The shorter versions maintain their inflation and weeping much better. If I had it to do over again, I would just buy two 50 foot hoses instead of this one 100 footer. Set up of such a long hose is also more of a chore than for the shorter ones. All have the consistency of a piece of cooked linguine pasta and tend to twist on themselves once the water pressure inflates the tubes, requiring me to go over the entire length again to straighten these out. 100 feet is a lot of length."
2,"It's OK, not great","It's very tough to find a decent soaker hose, at any cost. Swan is downright terrible and the company doesn't respond. This hose worked well for a couple of years before splitting on the sides. It's not used everyday. Maybe only 10 times a month during the summer and only at night for about an hour each time. The top side of the hose is very difficult to find and can only be set out during the day. The hose is very light and tends to keep twisting. Can take an hour to set up correctly. Still,it's the best I've found."
2,Dubbed,"This is a story about 2 Navy cadets (Ricardo Montealbán and Abel Salazar), their personal lives and professional careers. It is also a story about honor, friendship, making decisions and their consequences. Filmed in 1945, the atmosphere of world war is present in the background.As for the DVD itself, let me describe the version I purchased: CineVisión by Image Entertainment. it has only one feature: PLAY. What is very upsetting is that the soundtrack is entirely dubbed! I was hoping on hearing the very young Ricardo Montalbán's voice in his native Spanish. This DVD is not remastered. Thus the overall 2 star rating. I would try my luck with a different better quality product hoping it is NOT dubbed.SPOILER: Though the drama unfolds somewhat predictably, I was not too happy with the part of the ending that honors the dishonorably discharged deceased cadet."
4,reel good,"You are basically paying for the fancy sharpening gel, which seems to be a variant of lava soap (something granular suspended in a gel). The crank is not really proportioned well, but I didn't use it. It is much much much easier to just stick a drill on the mower instead of this crank (@slow speed), and you can save yourself a lot of agony. End result for my revitalization of an old mower was something that cut very very well. Though it took several adjustments and several applications of the sharpening compound, and many thousands of rotations."
5,Great Product,After adjusting the blades and sharpening them with this product my mower is cutting better than new.
4,great product,did what it was suppose to mdo really worked well on sharping the blades on out reel mower
2,Did not work for me.,"Maybe the blades were too far gone, but I could not get them sharpened enough to do the job. Had to put the mower to rest. At that price, wish it had worked!"
3,its okay,this product does not work as well as I would likeyou have to keep sharpen the blades three to four timesbefore they are sharp
4,Made my life easy,It is a little more technical than I like but still easy enough for a 66 year old women to getter done!
4,Amazing results,"I bought a used reel mower off of Craig's list that needed some tunning. I tried the local lawn mower repair shops and none of them would touch it. They claimed ""you need special equipment."" The special equipment is a screw driver, the paste that comes with this kit, and an electic drill. I followed the instructions as to removing the wheel but instead of the included crank, used my electric drill. In no time paste is flying everywhere and the blades were paper cutting sharp."
1,Didn't fit,"The shaft on my lawn mower was to large for the crank handle; I returned the product. As it turned out, it wouldn't have sharpened my blade very well since it was damaged by stones."
1,Hmmm,"This is like buying a pet rock. It took a few weeks to arrive. Now in hindsight, it was probably a case of the company being shocked that sombody actually was stupid enough to buy this snake oil; in which case they had to scramble to make it (by mixing sand with blue hand cream; throwing in a cheap tool to hand crank). I actually attempted using this stuff and midway through suddenly felt like the boy who bought those x-ray glasses out of the back of a magazine. Save your money for a case of beer to have after mowing the lawn (with a dull reel mower)."
3,Not Sure,"I am not sure my reel mower even needs sharpening. For one thing, I can't even get the wheels off to sharpen the blades. That has nothing to do with the sharpening kit so my review really has nothing to do with the kit. I haven't even been able to try the kit out. Like I said, my mower may not ever require sharpening, I will just have to keep at removing the wheels."
5,Good sharpener,"Big fan of the the reel sharpener. Once you get the hang of it, it works quickly. This link is very helpful for guiding you through the first time. [...]"
3,Not bad...but,"I bought this and only used it once. Then the handle broke off of my mower. In the 2 times I was able to mow since we used it it seemed to have improved a little, but I was going to give it another round of sharpening before we used it again. So it seems to work ok, but it is a little tedious to do and will not restore a brand new edge."
5,Absolutely essential item!,"I love my reel mower and this sharpening kit really keeps the blades sharp! Easy to use. Awesome, must have!"
2,sharpening kit,"Don't waste your money,if you are handy with tools just buy valve grinding compound it works the same."
5,works great!,I was skeptical about using this product although most reviews are pretty good. When it arrived in the mail I immediately tried it out and it was so much easier to cut the grass. The instructions are very easy and clear and once you sharpen your lawn mower blades it will be even easier to do in the future since you won't have to go step by step in the manual.
5,super easy!,"this product was soooo easy to use, it's almost ridiculous!!!i takes a bit of elbow grease, but well worth it. the price was way below any other web site i'd visited, too."
1,same as grinding compound,"Go to your auto parts store and get some grinding compound for a fraction of the cost.Also, for a much quicker sharpening session, remove both wheels, swap the gears so that the reel turns backwards, apply the compound, and walk the mower up and down the driveway. The backwards operation provides the backlapping to sharpen the reel and blade. Clean up the excess, and swap the gears back. Total time: less than 10 minutes."
3,Part of owning a reel mower...,"Part of owning a reel mower is sharpening the blades. It cuts better and requires less energy from you to do a good job.All this kit provides is a paste that is the same as valve lapping compound from a FLAPS (friendly local auto parts store) and a handle.I think you'll find that a jar of valve lapping compound will work just fine at a lower cost. You can use a 1/2"" drill to turn the reel blades or roll the mower around.Just Google up the instructions for sharpening a reel mower for best results.For those who don't know valve lapping compund is an abrasive mixed with a grease to make a paste which slowly grinds the surfaces between two metal components. You are painting this paste on your mower's blades. The rotation of the reel causes the two cutting surfaces to machine each other to a fine cutting edge.You'll need to do this from time to time to make a reel mower do a good job with a minimum of effort from you. I sharpen my mowers at the beginning of each season."
1,Useless,The crank didn't lock on and the compound was all dried up. Maybe I can use the cheap brush for a painting or staining project.
1,Blade Sharpening Kit.,"I have an old Pope Hand Mower. The crank handle shaft supplied diameter is smaller & does not fit my machine, nevertheless the grinding paste is brilliant. Details of the diameter were not supplied on the Amazon Add, so in blind faith I waited, hoped and was disappointed. I still think the product is brilliant and extremely cost effective.Cheers from OZ"
3,OK price.OK product,"Im not going to rant and rave about this product since I somewhat regret buying a reel mower in the first place (long story!).Yes, the directions were easy to understand, and it did seem to make somewhat of a difference in the sharpness of the blade.Again, the product was ok..suitable, but nothing to write home about."
5,Renew Skin and Spirit!,"I LOVE the smell of this oil! It is softly scented with a light hint of citrus. I am VERY sensitive to smells and this oil is light. I take this along whenever I get a maasage. Not heavy, cloying like lotions and some oils where you feel like you have been sealed with a second skin. Ugh! I highly reccommend this oil. I have not tried it as a bath oil (as the bottle suggests) but I'm sure it would be great as a bath oil too. LOVE THIS STUFF!"
3,Experts Comments,This Body Wash is real good stuff and forms a clear lather and works out well on the body for a good nice and smooth feeling. Daily use of this really improves the skin smoothness.
2,Pointless,"A friend recommended thsi movie to me, promising a lot of laughs. I found it juvenile and pointless."
4,"""Airplane!"" meets ""St. Elsewhere"";-)","As I said, it's kind'a-like (okay, a lot like:) an offspring of ""Airplane!"" meeting ""St. Elsewhere"". I might've given it 5 stars instead, but in my sort'a humble opinion ;-) it wasn't quite so ""inspired original"" as ""Airplane!"" was. But it was awfully close. Terrific! (I'm glad it's on DVD now 'cause my old VHS's color-tint quality has been looking sort-of greenish for the last few years. I could use a new copy of the movie.;)"
4,Another old good movie (I'm told),"Arrived on time, decent recording. Ordered as a gift for my dad and I honestly haven't watched it, but I haven't heard him complain about it so it must be alright."
1,Wrong FORMAT on Disc,"Let's get one thing straight at the start, "" I do not hate the movie"" . What I find quite disconcerting is that here in Australia and the Pacific region NTSC is not offered we get PAL as in Europe. You should be aware of the different regions prior to sending wrongly formatted DVD to clients. I hope this gets to the people who need to be advised accordingly.You may rest assured I shall be purchasing other items from time to time.............regards James Chryssochoides"
1,WHAT WAS I THINKING??,"For years I've waited for this movie to come out on DVD. I remember seeing it as a kid and thinking it was the funniest movie ever. So when I finally picked it up at my local retailer and went home and watched it, I was less than enthusiastic. The reality didn't quite hold up to the memory.What I thought was going to be a fun parody of daytime hospital dramas (e.g. General Hospital, The Doctors, etc), was just another boring comedy (if even). Sure, there are a few cameos by former and some current GH stars, but the similarities end there.Aside from that, it just wasn't funny. Nothing really made me laugh out loud. I was expecting some good Airplane style parodies but it fell flat by comparison.Definetely not worth the money. I waited for years for this and was left with the perverbial ""what was I thinking???"""
3,Young Doctors in Love,"This movie does for medical school what ""Airplane!"" did for airline disaster movies. It is a must-have for those with a love of the ""B-side"" comedy and have a few extra beers. It follows the paradigm of a soap opera with all the cliches. Without giving away too much, an assorted bunch of characters pursue their medical degree (and each other) and move through their residency. Good for some very good laughs: ""Due to a mix up in urology, there will be no apple juice served today."" Oh, yeah, Demi Moore and Sean young..."
4,Pretty comprehensive,"I thought this book covered a lot of Japan and not just the main cities. It was nice to read about so many of these places, many of which I've never even seen when I lived in Japan. I thought the detail was good and allowed me to envision being there.After reading this I read another book on Amazon called ""No Elbow Room"" by Kenneth Andrews, and found that one totally amazing. It took me so much further into the Japanese culture and business world. The 2 books together really made me feel like I knew Japan."
5,Beautiful travel book on Japan,Beautifully written and illustrated. I really like the part about Japanese customs and manners. It has been very helpful.
4,Great Japan guide,"This little book was a fantastic guide through Tokyo on my recent first trip to Japan. It got us to all the important sites and explained their significance. I love having all the pictures in the book - it is often the only way I can tell if I am in the right location.However, I must admit that it was more fun to use this book as a general guide and wander around, discovering the interesting sights off of the beaten path after you have seen the major tourist attraction in a location. This guide seems to cover the major tourist sites only (which is typically what I want to see on my first visit to a new country).Also, this appears to be a very popular book with tourists - there were many times when we could spot fellow tourists because they were carrying this same book, often in spanish, italian, or one of the other many languages that this guide is translated into."
3,Nice player but the sound is too Low in car,"I purchased this player 4 days back and I played some MP3 songs in car. When the car is running on road and some noise is there outside, then you feel that that sound is a bit low and cannot hear properly. Also, some hissing is there if you increase the volume of the car casseet player. The headphones in the pack are not good. Only one earpiece sounds and another does not. Also , everytime you start the car, you find that the sound level of the player is muted and have to make it full each and every time."
3,"Bueno, pero ...","Es un buen discman, adolece de volumen muy bajo de salida y demasiados cables para conexiones, algo mas inhalambrico, seria deseable."
1,low quality tool,"Tool arrived on time and well packed, no issues with the seller. This tool was not ready to use. It appears that the tool received a very quick going over with an angle grinder on the outside 3/32 inch of the blade. After several hours of trying to clean up the grinder marks and trying to put a bevel on the blade, (forging appeared to be unworked), I attempted to use the tool to remove vines in the yard. The tool was excellent at reaching up and pulling the vines down low enough to reach with my pruners, but it would not cut anything and the tool was rather ineffective on vines at ground level also. It appears to have good steel in the forging, however I will not spend any more time and effort in trying to get this tool in the proper condition for work. Council Tool did not reply to my email regarding the quality of this tool."
4,"What a Thriller This Is, Do Not ""Abandon""","Katie Holmes stars (coincidentally, not) as Katie, a college student who has a bright future. Just when life is perfect for her, a detective (Benjamin Bratt) shows up, questioning her about her ex-boyfriend Embry, who's been missing for two years. Soon, Katie begins seeing [visions of] Embry around the campus. This twist of a script makes the film jump up and down, back and forth numerous times through flash-backs and flash-forwards. For some, it's puzzling. For others, it's a ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat, right up to the ingenious finale. Holmes definitely stands out, and this box-office failure is worth a second glance. The suspense thriller is brilliantly written and directed by the award-winning screenwriter of ""Traffic."" Others may find the movie a lost cause, but you shouldn't ditch ""Abandon."""
1,I wouldn't .......,"I wouldn't give it much time. [...]. This movie was stretched into an hour and a half of what could have been covered in a 10 minute short story. And not even a good short story at that. Anybody who didn't see this ending coming needs to get some shock therapy treatments.This movie gets 1 star because Holmes and Bratt's acting was enough for 2, but the Heath Ledger wannabe ex-boyfriend was just plain bad. Why would anybody want to be Heath Ledger anyway?Bottem line - just skip it and save your money."
2,anemic thriller with good cast,"this one makes your blood thin. I watched this expecting a lot of twists but it didnt, only the end. Katie Holmes (The Gift, First Daughter) is beautiful as always but we dont feel for her character. Benjamin Bratt (Tv's Law and Order, Pinero) is always watchable but his character seems a little bit out of shape and Charlie Humane or whatever his last name is, is boring as hell as Holmes supposedly dead boyfriend. theres moments where you keep wondering, theres moments where you get headaches like that scene where Holmes and friends get high and its like 4 minutes of blue flashing. anyways it wasnt that good but it wasnt horrible. Stephen Gaghan wrote a even better movie called Traffic. Also starring Fred Ward (Corky Romano, Tremors), Gabrielle Union (Bad Company, Bad Boys 2) and Tony Goldwyn (Kiss The Girls, Kuffs)"
2,worse then I've expected,"The trailers make this film a chilling thriller with some cool twists but really it is a slow moving piece of junk. The characters, Katie and Embry, are mediocure and poorly used. The screenplay was a fluke! I mean, who wrote it? Most of the flashbacks that Katie recives don't even make sense--dont fit into the movie at all. And the so called stalker-dead boyfriend does not even do his role of 'scaring' the audience. We, the audience, were supposed to be 'moved' but this film doesnt deliver. All razzle, no dazzle. What a waste of 90 min.Note that the ending of the movie will shock you beyond belief. You will NOT expect it at all. I say that it somehow ' saved' the film, but it was a poor save nonetheless. Watch at your own risk."
3,Psychological melodrama,"Abandon is a blend of murder mystery and psychological melodrama. Although given ambivalent reviews by critics and largely ignored by audiences, the film is better than the tepid response would suggest. The plot concerns a cold case - a college student disappeared mysteriously two years ago. Katie Holmes plays a remote isolated intellectual who may be the key to the mystery, or may be insane. The direction is very indirect, with repeated shifts forward and backward in time. Filmed largely at Canada's McGill University, the ambience captures the grim environment faced by the few students who are dedicated to academics in a culture of drunken revelry. The implicit villain in this film is the society that ignores or ostracizes its best thinkers."
3,"I Give this movie a C+, pacing too slow and predictable.","A highly ambitious college student is working on her thesis and appears to be stalked by a boyfriend that has been missing for over 2 years, is your basic plot. Katie Holmes and Benjamin Pratt do a pretty good job acting, they develop their characters well. The problem is in the directing of the movie, it is not very stylish and the pacing is boring (soundtrack maybe?). Their didn't seem to be a flow that works to well and I knew what the twist was alomst after a 1/4 of the movie was finished and it is not all that exciting. (No where near the same quality of a twist you get from watching 'Fight Club', one of the best twisted plot movies ever made.) Wait till cable, do not waste money on a movie that is only watchable once. Not terrible, just nothing special."
1,I fell asleep watching it...,"... when I woke up at the end, I found out the ending from my bf that it is just as I predicted midway through the story. No mystery at all, very predictable, slow and boring."
3,I thought I knew the ending but I was wrong...,A psychological thriller that might related to any of us of being abandon.... I thought I knew the ending but I was wrong. Not a very fast pace movie but it got me at the end. 2.5 out of 5.
2,Not nearly as good as it should have been,"I went in to Abandon with high expectations, I left very disappointed. The first hour is what I expected it to be interesting and paced well, if not very exciting. But the last half-hour just ruins the movie. What starts out as an above-average thriller from the beginning ends in a muddle with an EXTREMELY disappointing ending that will make you wish you didn't invest in what you just watched.What the film does do right, it does very well. Such as the casting of Katie Holmes and Benjamin Bratt. They're both very good in their roles and do what they can with a very bad script. Also, the film does a good job of keeping a dark atmosphere and making us care up to final 30 minutes where it just falls apart.BOTTOM LINE: This is a good mystery/thriller that keeps you interested up to the final act. But then the movie slips further and further until it completely falls at the terrible ending. (2.5 stars out of 5)"
2,Predictable,"All I can say about this movie is that I guessed how the whole story was gonna go just by watching the trailer and a few interviews with Katie Holmes. This movie is not for the thinking kind and moves so slowly that you'll wish you were the one halluciniting and not the characters in the movie. All the actors did a fine job. And Ms. Holmes turned in yet another terrific performance giving this movie its only redeeming quality. However, I went to this movie to see a thriller and a mystery, hoping for a few scares, but I came out of it sad. Sad that the main character has so many problems in her life and sad that I didn't go see The Ring instead."
1,Boring,"I am a big fan of Katie Holmes, but I can't deny that this movie is boring and disappointing. I was literally falling asleep in the movie theatre. In fact, I think I only focused in on half of the movie. I would not recommend this as a movie to watch over again."
1,What is this...,"This isn't scary at all. The plot was easily figured out, and I saw the ""surprise ending"" from a mile away. This isn't horror this is junk, I highly recommend not seeing this or Swimfan, because both lack 1.)ORIGINALITY and 2.) PLOT! So skip this and see something else."
2,"It was reasonably entertianing, but...","...for a mystery/thriller, there was very little that was mysterious or thrilling. From the first 15 minutes of the film, the end was obvious. Call me crazy, but I like plot twists that I don't see coming a mile away.But hey, it could have been worse - it could have been Disturbing Behavior."
2,McGill Alumni pay close attention...,"The movie itself is pretty bad, but as a McGill graduate, I was pleasantly surprised when I was flipping channels and happenned upon scenes of Leacock, Upper Rez, Douglas Hall, the Royal Vic Hospital, and even the football field that our proud Redmen share with the Montreal Alouettes. Definitely worth checking out..."
1,What... the... HELL!?,"I saw this in the theaters and wanted to burn all the copies. The ending makes absolutley NO sense, and the story pretty much [stinks]. It was also OVER HYPED and the dvd [is bad].AVOID EYE CONTACT!"
2,eh...........,"I never, ever thought I'd say it...but Katie Holmes on screen about 98% of the time just didn't do enough to make this movie worth it. Decent premise, I suppose. Boyfriend missing, recovering alcoholic cop on the verge of a relapse. It just doesn't add up, and there's a supposed ""twist"" at the end can be guessed as soon as you learn the premise. Coulda been better."
2,Not enough story to warrant a feature film,"First off, starting with the positives - 'Abandon,' on DVD contains an above average video transfer and a superb, well mixed Dolby 5.1 audio track. The score is moody and foreboding without being too over the top as well. The disc extras are somewhat light with your typical 'making of' featurette and 8 or so deleted scenes that are instantly forgettable.On the downside the storyline borders on meager. As a psychological crime thriller this film would've been better suited as a 22 minute episode of 'Alfred Hitchcok Presents' rather then the 98 minute feature it was stretched out to be. Couple this with the overall lackluster performances and you're left with a flick you could well do without unless you find yourself nursing a hangover one morning with nothing better to do."
3,it's an ok thriller.,"well abandon is an ok thriller, that does play with your mind.but it lacked something although i was bit creeped out after i saw .katie holmes was good in her role, believeable but not if know what i mean she just need some more season , she is quite lovely as leading lady not bad for somebody that came off the wb . A Warning to people who have seizures you might want to avoid this one there's a scene in the film that has lights flashing fast like stobe lights just thought i should warn you, but if your not affected by that then nevermind."
2,Abandoned sense of direction,"You know when you watch a movie half-way through and you get the general idea of what the movie was about, but you're not quite sure of all the details of the plot? That's the same feeling I got when I watched Abandon all the way through. The movie had a sense of direction equal to that of a chicken with its head cut off. The plot just kind of staggered around, didn't really go anywhere. There are points in the film where you can tell that suspense is trying to be created, but there isn't any real ground here to build suspense. You feel like you should be expecting something riveting to happen, but you're not sure what, and nothing really happens. Overall, there's some okay points in the film involving character development and preformance, but that's not enough to save this mostly uninteresting and inconclusive movie."
2,Poor attempt at a mystery,"I was disappointed at the end of this movie...disappointed I wasted 91 minutes of my life! I did give the films two stars: one for Benjamin Bratt and one for the cinematography that effectively brought out the dark atmosphere/overtone of the film. Aside from that, there in nothing else worth much in the film. The storyline is very predictable and the acting wasn't too hot.Rent this if you love Benjamin Bratt or are in the mood for ""Mulholland Drive"" type movie..."
1,Boring!,"I'm not a person that is easily bored but I could not wait until this movie was over. The only reason I continued to watch it was just because I wanted to see the end (which, by the way) was pretty predictable. I didn't watch it at the theater and I didn't rent it either. It just happened to be on one day and that is why I even started watching it. Final verdict: If you're curious to watch it, just wait until it's on TV but don't spend money on it."
2,What a boring movie,"This movie is so boring I can't even really put it into words. When they kept switching to the scene where shes in the snow or something I thought I was gonna fall asleep I swear to God. The ending is the only thing that saved this movie from a horrible review. But still, I dont reccomend this. It's not scary at all and there's no scenes that even make you jump. None of my friends like this movie, and I haven't seen too many good reviews on it, so it's not going to do very well."
1,Abandon all hope!!,"I have rarely, if ever, turned off a movie. I did with this one. I don't know where to start with it. Suffice it to say, it lacks any serious plot - it stumbles around looking to create one, but it does not have one. I constantly got the feeling that someone edited out about an hour of the movie. I could go on for hours, but I won't. Just save yourself the trouble and leave this one alone!"
1,Abandon this movie!!!,"Not only is Abandon poorly written, but boring as well.Without Katie Holmes, ""Abandon"" would have been like ""Hardvard Man"" without Sarah Michelle Gellar, a long, boring Bore-Fest!Well, anyway, ""Abandon"" is about a success-driven college student Katie (played by Holmes(who else?!) And Katie's Boy firend Embry(??) has been missing for two years. And the the Dective(Bratt) and he is invetigating his disappearance. So, thats about it. There are also some jumper[scenes] in the movie.When the end finally came I was so glad. Not only because the movie I wasted $$$... and about two hours of my life was over, but also because the end was a shocker! So all in all , to be frank,this movie STUNK mayjorly!!P.S. I only gave this movie a star, because I couldn't leave without one. Otherwise, I would give this stinker a big fat ZERO!ZILCH! NADA!"
2,ABANDON has no spice,"I'm not sure how to explain this movie.I actually think that Katie Holmes gives a very solid performance. A troubled girl who holds many mysteries inside her head. She plays it well. I think even proves that she's a very good actress, if given a better surrounding.It's the things around her that are so bland, that you never really care. The story has no build. It has no muscle. The characters around her are flat and non-dimensional. Benjamin Bratt's character, and no fault of his own, is undeveloped. The story is even more non-dimensional. The suspense is so flat, that you never get involved.It could have been a good movie... if you can manage to sit through the monotone delivery that plagues the movie throughout, it actually has a decent payoff in the end."
5,amazing movie,"Such an awsome film! My eyes were glued to the screen.You watch as Katie, in her last year of collage, is haunted by thoughts of her old boyfriend Embry who dissapered two years ago. When a police man starts Investigating katie starts seeing embry again. He is watching her in class, in the library and theatening her.This movie will keep you guessing untill the amazing conclusion."
2,Abandon : The Worst Film I've Seen This Year,"After the great sling of thrillers like ""Signs"" and ""The Ring"" I thought going to see Abandon would be pretty well worth my money also. Well..I was wrong. The predictable storyline, if you can even figure out what the main plot is, the mediocre acting and the unoriginal ending, the whole movie is pretty much worth half of what you pay at a matinee showing. The only up points were the moments when you got startled, and the few times when you felt like it was suspensful.C-"
5,So Much Fun,I got my slide at the begining in the summer of 2005. The first day I got it my dad set it up so I could use it. I couldnt wait until my neighbors could come over to play on it with me! It is very good and well built because it has a blow up section so you dont hurt your body while you land. There was only one little problem a couple of the kids that I wanted to go on it were big. I had a feeling that if I let them go on it it might pop it because of the weight limit. Some were older than me so I also didnt know how rough they would be on it. I just wish it could hold a little more weight! But overall this is so much fun and a great buy.
3,Tent Camping look for other reference,This is great for the RV's not so good for tent campers and Motorcycle Adventure tourers.
3,Not the third edition as the book states,"Ok so when a book says cirst published in 2001 but this is the third edition I expect updates. Instead you get gas prices of below 2.25 and old old photos. Yes it was only 3.00 and this was why I did not return it, but we are driving up there and going to be living in Fairbanks. It would be nice to know what is still open, updated prices of things and such. Just saying."
4,Alaska Camping Guide,This overview of the many camping sites across Alaska and we are really looking forward to visiting and staying at several during our vacation.
4,A Great Resource,"This book is a great resource for the Alcan Highway if you plan on taking an RV. This book has been written by people who have made several trips up and down the and know how to prepare, what is where and where to go ."
5,Great Campground Guide,"I should probably wait until after our trip in June, 2007, but so far this has been a great campground guide for planning. I have been using it in addition to the Lonely Planet book and the Milepost."
5,Great Camping Book,bought this book along with the Milepost for the drive up to Alaska. Im not an rv'er by any means and always looking for the cheapest and most primitave place to tent or car camp. This book is awesome because it helped me to know which places to stay away from and which ones best will suit me (though it would be the same for the rv'er). I make the drive in a couple weeks and this along with the milepost this seems like a must-have. Also it was good to get to the Alaska section of the book. . . back to FREE camping!! also great info on fishing too!
1,Missing pages,"The book seems to be very well-written & valuable, but is missing pages 257-320 (Kenai Peninsula) & has repeated pages 129-192 instead.Check your copy carefully as soon as it arrives."
4,Nice to have along to supplement info in Milepost,"The Milepost is great but this book really does compliment it--fills in the missing info in a concise way. Well-written and supplies much more than just the essential camping information--road info, fishing, you-name-it. Well done. Also like the diversity of reporting--lodges that have RV and/or camping sites that you might otherwise not know about, just as an example of the depth of this book."
5,Very well written,"The latest edition in the Church's book on Alaska travel is their best yet. A ""must have"" book for any Alaska traveler written by experienced Alaska travelers."
5,Alaska RV guide,This book is everything it is advertised to be and more. We are finding it to be the perfect guide for planning our upcoming Alaska trip. This was money very well spent.
3,"Product good, sellar not responsive",I bought this bracelet for my wife for Christmas. It arrived promptly and in good shape. It was however the wrong size. I have tried numerous times to contact the company for an exchange and have not recieved one reply. I will not purchace anything from them again.
5,It's Beautiful!,I ordered this bracelet as a gift. This bracelet is so beautiful and it has a nice weight to it. It's worth the price.
5,Excellent and highly informative,"Although I do have a background in science (pre vet sciences and more), and holistic methods (started with me then kidney failure in cat due to misinformed diet information from ""main stream"" vets) I started researching and found this book along with others. (Dr. Pitcairn's for example)Highly informative, and although another on this thread mentioned too complex - well nutrition and healing methods are not simple and need some ""home work"" as with anything. (although I do have to admit when a pet is sick, one does want assistance, and now here in NYC there are holistic vet. One can go in informed, educated and with best interest of pet cared for thanks to books such as this one.That said - I found her book well laid out, highly educational and well referenced with links to other resources."
1,This book is bogus,"I read in this book thay beef is bad to feed your pet,however; when i read deeper the book states that one should feed the pet a beef knuckle as a means of nutrition. BUYER BEWARE!"
5,Great Sneak Peak Product,"The Nintendo Gamecube preview disk includes playable game demos of upcoming games including Viewtiful Joe, Splinter Cell, Sonic DX Director's cut, and a very new title, Billy Hatcher. The game is only a demo, so don't expect too much, ..., you get to enjoy testing out these great games without fighting in the line at the store where the controller is in two pieces and the A button doesn't work. This is sure to be a cool collector's item someday, as Nintendo does not release game demo disks to the public. One downside that some may find disturbing, is that the Viewtiful Joe demo does not have a pause option, and it is timed. However, for a demo, this is not really a problem, and is very common. So go ahead and be the first to check out Nintendo's next line up of great hits."
5,Awesome,"That's all I can say. This is the best thing Nintendo has done for there fans. Viewtiful Joe and Soul Calibur II are great. The 2 player on SCII is awesome too(Go to arcade and have the second player hit start). Billy Hatcher is O.K. but its a very childish game and Splinter Cell is cool also. The videos are also very good, I can't wait for Rogue Squadron III."
4,Atheist loves this album,"Title says it all. This album is great and definitely the best from the group. I'm an atheist, so I don't really appreciate the message of the music much...but hell the music is still great!"
4,powerful anthology consisting of thirty-nine tales from 2001,"As usual the G and G (great goldies) team has put together a powerful anthology consisting of thirty-nine tales from 2001 that run the mystery-crime-thriller spectrum. Obviously all the inclusions have seen print elsewhere, but not under one tome before this compilation. The contributions for the most part are excellent depending on the reader's taste, but none are terrible regardless of palate. In addition three articles report on the general state of the genre during 2001 and four country specific reports (Great Britain, Australia, Canada, and Germany) furnish insight into the trends. THE WORLD'S FINEST MYSTERY AND CRIME STORIES, THIRD ANNUAL COLLECTION, VOL. 3 provides the audience with a delightful slice of some of the year's better short stories.Harriet Klausner"
2,Not as good as other anthologies,"Although the collection represents a wide spectrum of sub-genres (cozy, hardboiled, etc.) it seems that only very typical specimens of each type were chosen. It does not seem the editors looked very far and wide for stories. There are some damn fine tales in this book, but the collection as a whole is neither ground-breaking nor especially interesting. Fans of business-as-usual mystery will love it. More demanding readers who like to see the genre push the envelope a bit more will be underwhelmed."
3,A Good Read,"The book was well written, informative and unbiased. However, it had too many characters and too many jumps across the space time continuum. This is a good primer to Business @ the Speed of Thought: Using a Digital Nervous System."
1,Lacking,"This book is a bit dull. It includes a lot of facts, but it does not include the opinions of people who knew Bill Gates personally."
5,Access and Excel is not user friendly like Paradox & 123.,I read what is on this website today because I had become frustrated with trying to copy the excel worksheet to access.I never had this problem with Paradox 4.0 and Lotus 123 5.0. The files are imported more readily without trying to format the cells.I tried it all. I tried the special paste. I tried importing and I tried linking files. I tried pasting one row at a time.I have wasted fours hours today and I still have not been able to combine these files. If you know Bill Gates would you see that he gets this message.Thank you!
1,More myth-making about Gates,"This is yet another in the long line of books that invents history to justify the wealth of a single individual. Gates never invented anything of significance in the software area or any other; he and his gang have bought, copied, or stolen virtually every software advance Microsoft has ever marketed. The only amazing thing about Gates and gang is their unfailing ability to produce and sell low-quality operating systems and software applications. No one will ever get at the full ""real story"" about Gates, and all these books do is boost the prominence of this late 20th-century version of the classic robber baron."
5,Searching for White Christmas Soundtrack,I am a young fan of Bing Crosby's this was the movie that started it all for me and I would really appreciate some help in finding this cd. Please bring this title back
5,The best Christmas music ever!,Please bring this CD back. I have lots of friends and family who are dying to get their hands on this soundtrack. This movie is one of the best holiday movies ever made and it would be awesome to own the soundtrack too! Please consider it.
5,In Search of this Album,"When the movie celebrated its 40th anniversary, I bought the album. Unfortunately, my copy of the album was destroyed. I have been trying, unsuccessfully, to find another copy of this CD. I hope that you will consider bringing this CD back. I would love to purchase it. I am a big fan of Bing Crosby, Rosemary Clooney, and Danny Kaye, and I am a big fan of the movie and its music."
3,Interesting read.,"I borrowed the book from the library reading about how it was from the victorian type era, I had no clue that it was a romance novel. I guess I should have read the flap more intently. Aside from the cheesy romance things it was a decent read. It isn't historically accurate in the least, but who ... cares? If you want accuracy watch the history channel. They call it fiction for a reason.The author is a decent writer. Its definately worth a shot reading. Kind of a rainy day read."
1,A frivolous romance novel.,"This book is only slightly better than a Harlequin romance. (Except dime store romances don't take themselves quite so seriously.)It is a really dumb book - to be blunt. The characters are so unrealistic it is embarassing and the setting so contrived it is painful. The moral of the story is this: if you are beautiful, endowed with sexual prowess, money, and a specimen body, you too could have the world's most perfect romance. Yuk."
2,Great Writing but Awful Hero,"I don't care how good-looking a guy is, or how sweet he is to his child - that is, when he's thinking clearly and not banishing the poor thing to Scotland, probably never to see her again - if he's verbally abusive, he'll likely remain that way. He got angry at Charlotte - called her all kinds of vile names, then promised it would not happen again, and even promised to trust her. Didn't happen. Alex did the very same thing a few months later - called her the same names and failed to trust Charlotte as he'd promised. There's no way this guy would ever keep his word."
1,Simply Silly,"Like Lizzy's youngest sister in Pride & Prejudice, Potent Pleasures is simply silly. It does a disservice to the genre and the many talented Regency writers who have lovingly created well-written and historically accurate stories. The plot is illogical and the characters unlikable. Enough said about such a silly book."
2,Alex Was More Villain than Hero.....,"Although Alex was handsome, he was not likable. And I found it galling that he relegated his child to Charlotte - to raise alone, without him ever participating ( which he later came to his senses about).I also didn't care for the way Alex boasted about making love to so many women, including ""a Danish princess,"" yet not 5 minutes later, he's condemning Charlotte for the very same actions of which he was just so proud, (which he was wrong about, of course.) What an imbecile!"
1,Author Should Lighten Up on Male Characters!,"I love this author, and I love most of her books, but I wish she would make her male heros a little more perfect rather than undesirable. One knows when they read an E. J. book the male, like Alex, will be sweet one moment and horrifying the next - and the dialogue will be harsh.The characters like Charlotte (and Sophie) are usually so endearing they deserve nicer men in their lives. These Foakes brothers certainly didn't deserve these two fine women."
2,Two stars for the first half only.,"I love Eloisa James's books, so it didn't occur to me that I would dislike one so thoroughly. Let me just say, I hate books in which the plot hinges on the heroine's lack of virginity. I hate it even more when she lost her virginity to the hero, who doesn't remember/doesn't realize it was her/was drunk off his head. So, when I realized the WHOLE second half of this book was about the hero calling his wife a whore because she wasn't a virgin, I gave up. Definitely not her best; I'm not even going to read the rest of this series."
2,I didn't like it too much,"I am a huge fan of romance novels - Quinn, Quick, McNaught and Iris Johansen to name a few. I got this book from the library because of the good reviews here. I couldn't get into it at all. I am not one to point out historical inaccuracies and I don't care too much about that whole aspect so nothing like that really bothered me. Pippa did seem a little vocally advanced for her tender years but whatever.I didn't get into the romance as much as everyone else here seemed to. I didn't really like the characters. I have the whole set in this series out from the library so I will prabably finish it, but if I thing don't click for me by the end of the series I don't think I will read much more from James?"
3,Have a potent to be full of pleasure actually,"I just borrow this book from my friend as this is not my popular author. My friend said it quite good so I just tried. I could say this book just so so...actually the premise has so many potential, I also like the character...but the Author just let it go...to dragging for me especially in front and at the end. I only like the middle part and before the wedding night.So next time also I just borrow Eloisa James's book...definitely not a keeper."
4,Interesting...but...,"The very idea that this great father, Alexander Foakes, could become so angry that he didn't consider or half-realize that he was abandoning his daughter for a couple weeks was appalling.I did find Alex to be sexy and handsome and all that, and the story will definitely hold the reader's interest, (the reason for 4 stars) but in addition to his faulty parenting, he was quite cruel to Charlotte."
1,NEITHER POTENT NOR PLEASURES AT ALL,"This book is neither POTENT nor PLEASURES at all! This is so far, THE WORST regency romance with uttery anemic stupid unattractive hero heroin. The hero Alex is a lack-wit bully while the heroin Charlotte is a lack-wit ninny a passive victim. It seems the logic behind the story is ill-logical. The author treats the readers as if they are retarded. Furthermore there are too many uninteresting minor characters that cause too much distraction. Also there are lot of unnecessary details that put people to sleep. The melodramatic tragic events in this book are forced and unwanted because they are not that tragic at all. The story does not flow well and lots of the dialogs are dull dying small talks. The plots suck. The only lively character perhaps is Sophie.All mentioned above make this book a frustrating read. Had to put the book away. Too many well written books out there don't waste your time on this one."
5,nto as good as midnight pleasures but still a great read!,"I know that many reviewers didn't like this book because of some historical innaccuracies, but its a romance novel for goodness sakes, not a history book. Those things didn't bother me at all. I really liked this book, didn't at all mind the misunderstanding which actually made the book very interesting. What I didn't like was that it was so easily explainable. But all in all it was a good read, the romance was very sweet and I found myself liking charlotte a lot, and Alex was a stud."
2,Fair - 2.5 Stars,"This book was okay. I don't think it was as howlingly bad as some other reviewers, nor would I give it a great review. I tend to lose interest very quickly when characters behave in a way that stretches the bounds of credibility. For example: The hero is so crazy about the heroine, and when she finally admits that she met him long ago, he doesn't press for details and just assumes it was his twin brother? Give me a break. No man is that incurious. However, some of the other characterizations are pretty good, as is the plot. I think this writer will improve with practice. All in all, it might be worth picking up at the library if there's nothing more interesting around."
3,"An interesting premise, an impotent hero...","This is an interesting premise, this impotent hero. Unfortunately this was not well-developed. The book is quick and carries your attention along with it, but toward the end, it seems to have lost the author's attention. I have seldom read a weaker, more disorganized conclusion to a book. Somebody should spank her editor."
5,Amazingly Romantic,"I have read the entire Pleasures Trilogy: Potent Pleasures, Midnight Pleasures and Enchanting Pleasures. The Foakes brothers are incredible - loving too well, but not wisely. A must read for the romantic in you!"
2,So much promise... and not much else,"This book started out well -an innocent, young woman is convinced by a reckless friend to attend a masked ball and is seduced by the man of her dreams. Yes, that introduction has been used over and over in other romance novels, but it can still entertain.Unfortunately the plot was far less interesting after their initial encounter. The main conflict revolves around the hero's inability to recognize the woman he seduced and his doubts about his wife's integrity. Despite his supposed love, the constant misunderstandings made me roll my eyes and groan with frustration.Potent Pleasures wasn't terrible, but it certainly didn't make my top 10 list."
2,Story WAS interesting but ...,"Why was Alex Foakes so darn mean? He said and did too many things to lovely Charlotte for her to still love him.And really,he just assumed he would ""let"" Charlotte raise his daughter in Scotland while he lived in England and visited once a year! Charlotte loved his daughter, true, but that didn't mean she was supposed to raise HIS child because Alex decided to separate from his wife."
3,Disappointing,"I'd heard a lot about this book and so perhaps I came to it with unfair expectations, but I never really got into it, and by the end I was reading it because I'd started it rather than because I wanted to find out what happened. The characters seemed to act in the way the story demanded, rather than remaining true to themselves, and I wasn't keen on the plot. The writing is light, though, and there are some good moments. I'll give her other books a try."
5,Delightful! A sparkling new voice!!,"I picked up Potent Pleasures and read it in one night--I didn't put the book down for a second! How wonderful to have found such a talented new author and a book that is so charming and entertaining! Bravo, Eloisa!"
1,Trashy,"A review on the back of this book says, ""Utterly frivolous."" This may lead a potential buyer to think this a fun book to read -- people like myself, for example. Unfortunately, this quote is completely misleading. After reading about five chapters of POTENT PLEASURES, I felt as if I had jumped into a dumpster and rubbed rotting vegetables all over myself. Yuck.There are twists and turns in the book, but they're completely nonsensical, and when a character isn't doing something that I reeeeeally do not need to know about, the book is just boring. The characters, meanwhile, are as flat as the paper they're printed on, not to mention as flimsily constructed, and were completely unlikable.In other words, I thought this was a very trashy (and not in a good, entertaining way, either) novel that I fervently wish I had never spent money on. Beware, because you may wish the same, should you buy it."
1,a tedious book with unlikeable and unreal characters in very contrived situations,"The plot is described in many places, so I won't go through it.After the n-th time the heroine thinks she should tell thehero he slept with her before marriage and has forgotten,you lose all patience. Distress after distress that a fewwords can avert. It is hard to like heros or heroines withlittle self-respect that over and over again act stupidly."
3,Alex & Charlotte...,"Their initial meeting at the ball - where they slept together - was just too unbelievable. Good grief, I'm sure even the trashiest of women would have at least had one conversation with the guy, before jumping him. I certainly believe in 'instant attraction' but this was ridiculous.I didn't much care for Alex after getting to know him, but Charlotte was wonderful."
3,Good Writing,"One thing about this author's books - you can't call them boring. She keeps the reader turning the pages quickly. However, Charlotte, so sweet and beautiful,was so scared of Alex it made me sick, especially when she was giving birth. I felt SO bad for her. And it was all Alex's fault because of his BIG cruel, mouth! There was no way a guy like that wouldn't explode with rage again at the slightest provocation. Which was a shame, because Alex DID have a few good qualities."
1,Police?,"On page 6 of ""Potent Pleasures,"" the author refers to the London police.Since the story takes place in 1798 and Sir Robert Peel did not institute police until 1829, the reader wonders how much historical research went into this novel."
5,What a delightfully wicked Regency romance!,"""Potent Pleasures""--what a potent title for such a pleasureful read! It was such a refreshing change to read a Regency-era historical romance that starts out such a sensuous bang. And the joy ride continues from chapter one on. I hope there will be a sequel starring Alex's brother...can't wait for more."
3,Tight but cute,This is way too tight to get over the head of my three year old. I am not sure how people get this on bigger kids. Any child who dislikes putting on tight shirts will probably balk at this. The pattern is super cute. I wish they made a version with a velcro closure.
4,Good tunes well played,"Is it Celtic? Is it folk? Is it country? Is it pop? I don't care. This album is simply a lot of fun. The strengths: beautiful harmonies, catchy tunes, and some wonderful playing (notably by John Morris Rankin and Howie MacDonald). The biggest weaknesses: Jimmy Rankin's lyrics, which while better than past efforts will never be candidates for a poetry anthology, and vocals that occasionally cross the line to ""precious."" The best cuts, to my ear are ""Eyes of Margaret"" and ""Blue Eyed Suzie"" (both by John Morris) and Jimmy's ""You'd Feel the Same Way Too."" What do we need to do to get this group some U.S. airplay?"
2,Disbelief!,"I've not heretofor read any of Mr. Lehane's books, and this one was recommended by our librarian to read while awaiting for ""Mystic River"" to become available. I read ""Shuttered Island"" with continuing interest although the story line was becoming a bit bizarre. When I finished the last page, I just sat there somewhat stunned at the ending--""What??????"" I really felt I had just wasted my time. I certainy hope ""Mystic River"" makes more sense!"
3,The Sixth Sense Effect,"The only other Lehane I've read so far is Mystic River, which I loved in every possible way. And so with much anticipation, I stepped into Shutter Island.And was relieved.Here was Lehane again, writing about people I recognize, writing a novel full of mystery, psychology, and violence.I loved this book -- until I got almost to the end. At that point (the ""twist""), it did a ""Sixth Sense"" on me (or perhaps ""A Beautiful Mind"" is more accurate) and I was reeling. All that intrigue, all that mystery, just gone.Lehane led me to love Teddy's world too much -- and then he took it all away from me. I know it was by design, but I can't help what I feel -- that I was cheated, taken for a ride.The book makes perfect sense, no doubt about it -- but for me, on an emotional level, Shutter Island failed."
2,Don't Read Page 123,"The whole novel is completely given away very early on.It really isn't a mystery at all for those of you who enjoy a good Who-dunnit.If you've ever completed a simple anagram puzzle in your life, please save your $7.99 and read something else."
4,Worth your time,"I don't want to give away anthing about how this book plays out. But I do want to add my accolades to the many others already here. Lehane is a brilliant writer, and this is a gripping thriller. It's also a risky endevour. It's not a traditional crime novel, and it certainly doesn't hinge on the regular sort of bad guy, good guy stuff. As I got near the end of this and watched the main character struggle for truth I was totally with him. I was struggling too. That's the thing - Lehane manages to create his main character so well that you end up just as conflicted and troubled as he is. But then when it's all revealed it all makes sense and you can see the threads that Lehane wove in all the way through, right back to the first scenes. This book is that good, that carefully written.It would be a lot easier to write this review if I could say more about the plot revelations toward the end. I can't though. But do believe me, this book is worth your time."
5,A nother Winner,"When I finished this book I hugged it and said, ""good book! good book""! Dennis Lehane has produced another winning story. Now, two years later, I am re reading it to see if there were clues I missed the first time. I am so anxious to see the movie and can olny hope it packs the same wallop as the book. More, Dennis, please....."
3,"Good beginning, good middle, lousy ending","I'm looking forward to the movie and I hope the screenwriter fixed the lame ending.I enjoyed this novel up to the end. Apparently, I am not alone. I've read that a lot of people had trouble with the ending. Mr. Lehane did too, it seems. As for me, I was left scratching my head. I won't say any more about that so as not to give it away.Lahane is a good writer and I enjoyed the characters and settings. He made a few mistakes with federal law enforcement terminology but not many. (I am a retired federal agent.)I felt like I was there on the island with the marshals, or I think I was. Read it and you'll understand my confusion.All in all, a good book but with a confusing ending. It made the end of the Sopranos seem clear cut in comparison.Chuck Hustmyre"
3,OK but bad ending...,"The first 2/3rds of the book are great. Really draws you in as the mystery develops. But the end is very anti-climactic, with a very predictable ""surprise"" ending...lame!"
2,Expected More From Lehane,"Two Federal Marshals are dispatched to a remote island housing a mental institution for the criminally insane to look for a missing patient named Solando. Throw in a Hurricane that traps the Marshalls on the island, a lot of strange behavior, and you have the premise for Shutter Island.The book does not live up to the expectations Dennis Lehane's readers expect from him (although looking at the other reviews I could be dead wrong about that). There are glimmers of Lehane's talents, but the book feels like a rushed screen play. There is action, there is mystery, there are menacing situation, but it is all very glossy and superficial. The reader will also probably solve the mystery by page 150.It is not all grim however. The book does flow nicely, reads easily and the last 25 pages were very powerful emotionally. I did enjoy the book, but would expect something like this from James Patterson (this would be an achievement for him) but not from a fresh talent like Dennis Lehane"
1,A Disappointment,"I was drawn to this book by the raves for Mystic River. Now I'm wondering whether I should bother reading that one. Shutter Island reminds me why I don't read thrillers, even by so-called ""literary"" authors like Lehane. This book is filled with cardboard characters, spouting cliched dialogue in implausible situations. I grew tired of Lehane stringing bits of action together with sentences in which one ""and"" followed the next to give the reader the impression that something really was happening. The twist at the end left me saying little more than, ""Huh?"" Unfortunately, I don't care enough about the characters to go back through the book and figure out how it all came together. If you're looking for something to occupy you on a long plane ride, this book will fit the bill, but if you're a serious reader aware of some of the fine contemporary literature that's available today, I'll bet you'll be angry at yourself for getting suckered into wasting a few hours on this novel."
3,Disappointed Lehane Fan,"I hate to be the skunk but if you figure out the gimmick early, this one is torture. Every fiction writer will guess it well before halfway. About that same point, the quality of Lehane's writing declines steeply. I suspect that he doubted he had pulled it off.This is by far the weakest book from a very good writer."
1,Disappointing,"Really bad writing. I could read through the ""surprise"" way before the ending. Threw the book away after that."
2,L O L,I'm not reviewing Dennis Lehane's book. I'm reviewing Robert Hazelwood's review of Dennis Lehane's book. His is the best and funniest I've read by any of your customers - or by any of your editors for that matter. This is exactly how I felt about this book but Robert said it so much more cleverly than I could.
1,dissatisfied,I loved the authors other works and looked forward to another. This story I read until the middle and then threw the book out.
1,Cliched and Uninspired,"While I can't be certain, I am fairly sure that Lehane is trying to write with the depth and imagination of Thomas Cook--both in Shutter Island and in his previous novel, Mystic River. Lehane can write coherently, but he really doesn't have anything to say. Mystic River was boring and Shutter Island ""appears"" to be somewhat exciting, but if you read carefully it is really quite dull. Just writing about a weird island where outrageously insane people are treated doesn't make a persuasive novel. I found the ending highly predictable. Lehane could have written this novel in one sentence: ""There are crazy people in this world who are not amenable to medical treatment."""
5,Instant Fan,"Shutter Island is a great sales piece for Dennis Lehane. I had never read one of his books before and he has won an ""instant fan."" I was not able to put this book down except to sleep (which was a bit of a task in itself!. The other reviewers have done a nice job at describing a true psychological thriller that left me with my jaw open at the end of the book. The lead character is brilliantly painted and not with broad strokes. Plotting is excellent the story is utterly believable especially when thinking about it from the last page...back to the beginning.Pick up Shutter Island. Absolutely fantastic read.Kevin Hogan, Author of The 168 Hour Week: Living Life Your Way 24-7"
5,A great thriller,"If you are looking for a fast paced, perfectly executed, and suspensful thriller, then this is the book for you. Lehane shares a certain similarity to Harlan Coben but it is a more subtle likeness so if you like Coben, you may very well like Lehane too. The ending is not so much as a shocking revelation that the reader doesn't see coming but rather a slow, meticulous unraveling so that the end reads with much the same satisfaction as putting in those last few pieces of a challenging jigsaw puzzle. The book reads incredibly fast and is so completely enjoyable. Watching the movie directly after finishing the book is highly recommended."
4,Enjoyable Read,"I fell in love with this auther when I read ""Mystic River"" some years ago. His writing style captured me and I was hooked. I read (well, tried to read, but never finished) Gone, Baby, Gone a while back, and since hesitated on reading another one of his books. I am glad I gave him another chance, because I enjoyed this book through and through. (Slight Spoiler ahead)........I was a bit dissapointed with the ending, a little predicitable, a little cliche, but I enjoyed the ride getting there."
5,Best Yet,"I love Lehane's stuff, but this one is exponentially better than the rest. Simply put - the best book I've read in a decade."
5,Profoundly Devastating,"The historian Joyce Appleby said: ""Our sense of worth, of well-being, even our sanity depends upon our remembering. But, alas, our sense of worth, our well-being, our sanity also depend upon our forgetting.""Shutter Island is simply devastating. Dennis Lehane again demonstrates a real depth of understanding to the true costs of catastrophic loss. He is one of our finest writers. I anxiously await his next masterpiece."
4,Atmospheric Mystery,"I enjoyed this book quite a bit! It was well-written, with great characters (judging from the preview, I think that the movie has been well-cast). The plot held unpredictable twists and turns, but the ending was not quite what I was hoping for... I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. Still, the book, overall, was a great read with a real atmosphere."
5,Better than the movie,Another case where the book is ten times better than the movieThe movie changed the order in which things happened in the book the books sequence of events makes more sense than the movie
4,Easy read,Decent story with a nice twist. I knew the end from the movie just wanted to clear up some stuff that did not translate to the movie real well. Overall a good drama but not great.
4,Shutter Island,A good book for anyone who likes a fast paced thriller. Keeps you guessing all through to the end. A great overall read.
5,"A Unique, Psychological Thriller","Lehane's narrative momentum throughout this novel is gripping and nearly impossible to put down once you start reading it, the poignant descriptions, the flowing, realistic dialogue, the continuous mood that makes you feel that ""something is just not right"" keeps you turning pages. What the author is most skillful at is interweaving dream scenes into the plot without resorting to superficial devices like using italics or parentheses. The shift between actual events and probable events, or imaginations, are seamless. The way Lehane collapses the past, present and, sometimes even the future, into crisp, encapsulated moments of narrative passage is nothing short of masterful. Having seen the movie version of the novel first, I was not in the least bit disappointed in reading the book afterwards. The screenplay writers did an excellent job of maintaing the integrity and artistic merit of the work."
4,Fascinating discussion,"My book club selected this book for reading and discussion several months before the movie was released in theaters. It was not only the most popular book among the readers, but it also turned into one of the best discussions we have had. There was no point during the story in which the plot line lagged, and the end of the book lead to an interesting discussion on the readers' perceptions of what happened."
4,Still twisted after all these years,I have re-read the ending twice and can't quite get my head around it! Oh how the reader is fooled!
3,OK Thriller,"It held my attention, but it wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be. The ending was a surprise, which is definitely a point in any thriller's favor, but it didn't work for me on an emotional satisfaction level."
4,"Thoughtful, not scary","The brain is considered the last frontier - the unknown, unchartered territory of medical science. Dennis Lehane's detailed portrayal of an assylum for the mentally ill, its patients and caretakers helps the reader to understand all that we cannot yet comprehend about the mind. The fragility of the mind and the desperation of those in danger of losing their minds is what makes this book scary. Movie commercials for the tie-in to this book left me thinking it would be a horror, reminiscent of Stephen King, but the book is very far from that. It is much more thoughtful, a who-dunit mystery with a psychological twist and deep character development. It kept me up at night because I wanted to continue reading, not because of the content."
4,Predictable but engaging,"Just finished reading my first Dennis Lehane novel and will now defintely hunt down Mystic River et al. As a self confessed mystery buff (adore Pelecanos / Mankell/ Dibdin / Connelly)I found the quality of writing and plot line very satisfying in this novel but as per a few others here guessed the 'real' situation about a third of the way in. I dont care about that as its not the ending I read the book for but how the author gets me there, and Mr Lehane has a delicate yet powerful voice that held me through the night. The setting is disturbing and the final outcome convincing and affecting. I am still thinking back over the troubled life of Teddy Daniels, and his problems on reflection ring true - and truely horrific. A quick and high quality read from a my new favourite author."
2,Disappointing,"Promising (I bought it because of the very positive reviews and the promise of a shocking finale) and disappointing, written as if its only purpose was to have enough turns and breaks and cheap thrills to make an average noir movie - which it eventually led to. A good summer read - if that means anything - but that's about it. Agatha Christie made them better - and shorter - 50 years ago....I'd better focus on the classics next time."
4,Enkoyable read,I read this a month ago and I did enjoy it. I will say that the ending of the book was extremely predictable. But even so I really did enjoy it. It did make me want to check out some of his other novels.
1,A major disaster!,"The worst type of ""mystery""--where you're not sure what to think at the end and don't care. Horribly cliched dialogue and plotted like it was written in a weekend to meet a publishing deadline.I can't believe the author of ""Mystic River"" would stoop to this."
2,Abridged book,"Due to incomplete product description, the book was abridged and it is against my principles to read such books. I have donated the audiobook to my local library."
2,"A nothing read, despite excellent writing","This book is worth the read simply because of Lehanes writing - always competent and at times spectacular in his characterizations and economy of style. As for the substance of the book, it goes limp at the end, the author opting for the same ending done to death by earlier writers such as Fredric Brown, Kurt Vonnegut, and Ray Bradbury.This would have made a brilliant short story."
2,Shutter Island by Dennis Lehane,"What a disappointment this book turned out to be. By trying to be too clever by half with a new slant, Lehane has missed the boat badly with this dull offering. Plastic characters, an unexciting hero and a really depressing arena,this book in no way captures any of the magic of Angie and Patrick. Stay with them, Dennis - this one was a bumme. You have lost me until they return."
2,Disappointing,"As I read this book, I kept checking to see if I had the wrong author. I do think it would be a great movie but one I figured out half way through. Maybe he is just tired but had to fulfill a book deal because this book does not stand up to the standards established in previous books. I really missed his complex characterizations. This book was like a good wax museum; pleasant to look at but not real. Maybe Lehane wants to make a lot of money on a movie deal. Can't say that I blame him. Think Russell Crowe for the lead."
2,Forgive me,I had high hopes but I found this book contrived and it fell flat as a pancake at the end. I could feel the author trying to complcate the story at the expense of the flow. Sorry. Maybe it's just me. just me.
5,Stunning!,"This is a book i will remember for a long,long time.Having read other novels by Lehane i thought i knew roughly what to expect but this was something totally different-the shock ending left me feeling as if i had been physically hit!Read it!"
4,Plausible Ending?,"Since more than a few decriptions have been given, I'll forego that. I think Dennis Lehane is tops in his genre and love reading him. ""Shutter Island"" was a little disappointing in that I have trouble believing a psychiatric facility would go to such intricate lengths to bring a patient out of their psychosis. But then, this is fiction.Other than that, the read is great. As always, Lehane does not disappoint with his characterizations. He's a wonderful writer and one I will always read."
5,"My First Lehane, Won't be the Last","This is the first book by Dennise Lehane I've read and it certainly won't be the last. Since summaries have been given, I'll skip that part, but wanted to add that I found Lehane's writing to be excellent. He was very good at conveying the angst and regret US Marshal Teddy Daniels feels, the creepy personality of Dr. Cawley, and evoking a sense of agitation in the reader as the story builds.Very good story by an excellent author. I do hope it becomes the movie being discussed."
2,Huh?,"Maybe it's me because I was expecting something better and read the book with the constant feeling of disappointment and waiting for it to GET better or get SOMETHING. Dennis Lehane is a popular writer, a friend of a friend, and I was really looking forward to reading his book. I'm not really good at reading books that delve into other people's minds. I don't pick up well on subtleties. I felt as though a lot had happened to these characters before Lehane even started to tell us about them and we were somehow supposed to have ESP. There isn't much action except walking around a lot and talking even more. I found the book dull and boring and even flipping to the end to find out what happened made no sense. I wondered why the book wasn't on the bestseller list, and when I sent it to our library for their booksale, I knew why."
1,"Predictable, disappointing and banal","The ""surprise"" ending doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out. You keep hoping that the author won't really go there, but he does. Don't make an investment in this one."
1,CAN I HAVE MY MONEY BACK!,"Can't help it, I feel cheated. I'd never read Lehane, but a friend of mine saw the movie and said it was so great. I had my KindleKindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)at the table and she wanted to see the fast download, so--I asked for Shutter Island. There it was, a sample in just seconds. I thought, what the heck, I may as well read it. The start was strong. I downloaded the book. Big mistake. The farther along I got, the more cheated I felt. Hey, the convenient hurricane? Page by page things got worse until finally the insult of the last chapter. A real author cop out, but maybe it was a good thing. I won't waste my time on Lehane again, and I sure wouldn't go to the movie version."
5,FABULOUS!!!,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this book!!! Although, I didn't so much care for the ending, the story is so AWESOME, it doesn't even matter!!! I could not put it down. If you like thrillers or mysteries, this is sooooo the book for you!!! Put it on your list, you will NOT be disappointed."
1,What a crazy story!!!,"I really disliked this book, and it was a plot that has been told over a dozen times. What a waste of money and time!!Basically this is about Andrew, an ex military, ex US Marshall who lost his wife, and is having difficulty coping with reality, so the institution that he is placed at puts on this elaborate scheme to restore his mind.Lots of boring twists."
2,Dissapointed,"I've been a big fan of Lehane's since the very beginning, but I have to say that this book was extremely dissapointing. I've endorsed his work to many friends and family over the years and, unfortunately, could not for this subpar effort. I've haven't NOT finished a novel since I can remember, but almost did with this one. Another small peeve of mine: he's got to get off of the overused superfluous metaphor kick. He's too good of a talent for that."
1,Lehane's weakest novel,"This is easily Lehanes' weakest novel, and I've read them all. I'm not one who needs Angie and Patrick to return, so that's not my beef. I missed the maturity, character development, humor, hard hitting, well developed issues, plotting and incredible dialogue of Mystic River.This book develops Teddy's character thoroughly, but no one else. The rest of the cast is cardboard.The plot is implausible time and time again, the writing mundane and too concise. Particularly in the first half.The social or interpersonal issues raised are not of the scope of Mystic or covered with any degree of similar depth.I saw Lehane speak at a bookstore in California, and he was attentive, articulate, funny and very impressive. I hope the money hasn't affected his writing motivation, because it appears he churned this one out without much thought or depth.Bring back the best mystery writer of this century, Dennis. Take your time and do it right, as you can."
2,"Nope, nope, nope!","As someone who has read and loved every other single piece of Dennis Lehane's work - almost fanatically - this book is a huge disappointment and hopefully not a harbinger of things to come. The plot is transparent, cliched, and the characters can neither be liked nor hated, nor anything in between - there is no complexity to this novel at all - I saw the end coming a mile away and could barely rouse the energy to finish it. At the end, I didn't care what was real or what wasn't, nor did I spend any time imgaining what could have happened next - I was just glad it was over and even considered putting back onto Amazon marketplace for sale which is nearly unheard of for me. I hope Lehane isn't letting his publishers pressure him to produce too much too fast - he has built an amazing reputation; a few stumbles along the way like Shutter Island are OK - I just hope they don't become the norm."
2,The most boring beginning to any book I've ever read,"The beginning of this book is profoundly boring. It's simply the worst opening chapter I've ever read, bar none. The setting is drab, and even the characters are bleak. The entire chapter is about a dead father who was disappointed in our main character, a dead wife and vomiting from seasickness. Total score! I've read 4 chapters and already figured out most of the plot. A creepy doctor is running a prison for the criminally insane on a remote island. Gee, what could they possibly be doing there? Playing scrabble? Also, both marshals have serious mental issues before they arrive, so what possibly could go wrong? If you've ever seen a Boris Karloff movie, you can figure it out as well. Nothing fresh or exciting here."
3,"The book is ""allways"" better.",If you are wanting to read this book because you loved the movie. The book is almost a word for word. 2 more interviews when they investigating. No more details revealed. I think if you read this book first you are better off or you could just see the movie.
3,"Interesting, but....?","The anachronisms were what turned me off in this story. Supposedly set in 1954 (year I graduated from college), I saw so many things that never were 1954ish that suspicions came immediately. I know some did, but was the F-word used in every other conversation in 1954? Don't think so. References to electronic items the same, and some of the terminology about psychiatric procedures just didn't exist then. Seems to me the ending was clear enough, although only suggested."
2,The Author Writes For Himself,"Lehane is a very very good writer. He uses his talent to construct a novel like July 4th fireworks that are beautiful and exciting. At the conclusion, however, the reader is left with ashes and an empty sky. I don't always need a happy ending but I also do not like hopeless ones or endings that are depressing. One is left with the impression that the author was very clever, leads one down a garden path, and then ultimately leaves one gutted. Lehane ought to use his talent to better effect than to simply dazzle us, let us taste everything, and then abandon us with our stomachs upset."
2,Not as good as Mystic River - SPOILERS,"If you like Dennis Lehane as much as I do, then this is worth a read. However, the ""suprise ending"" was actually the logical one to me - I saw it coming about 30 pages into the book. I spent the entire book hoping that the ending would actually be a suprise, and, nope, it wasn't.This book is well-written, but the language can not even COMPARE to mystic river. That book is in a different league than this one - I honestly feel like ""Shutter Island"" could have been written by a lot of artists in the genre."
