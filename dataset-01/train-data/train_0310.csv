5,sticks to your ribs,"I'm reading the Barset series in order and have not been disappointed yet. Framley Parsonage is substantive, richer than The Warden, more serious than Barchester Towers, similar in much to Doctor Thorne, and slightly more intricate than DT. I enjoyed the introduction of a healthy dose of political gamesmanship in the form of descriptions of the parliamentary machinations and electioneering strategies. One also learns how to conduct financial shennanigans with horses, farmland, and public forests. The characters in FP are textured and almost always believable; there's only a few caricatures here. As always, the Everyman's edition is accompanied by a lucid introduction and helpful timetable."
1,Totally Bored !!,"After reading the first couple chapters I discontinued reading. It was too laborious to continue. I was quite surprised, since the book had very good reviews. This was very uncommon for me. I am currently reading ""Random Harvest"" and am greatly enjoying the read."
4,A Good Woman,"Although this book is centered on the matter of Mark Robarts and his moral dilemma, we also encounter his sister, Lucy. She is one who is presented to us as a real Christian woman. She takes on herself the care of Mrs Crawley who is suffering with a deadly fever. Lucy is the ideal woman, beautiful, charitable, caring. She deserves the very best and is rewarded for her efforts by becoming Lady Lufton. Mark on the other hand, suffers a great deal largely from ill-advised friendship with Sowerby. Mark wants to achieve status by ill-advised social connections. Thankfully he is saved from ruin by his friends."
2,"Good for drill manual buffs, but is it history?","Nafziger's compilation has usefulness if one wants to know the drill regulations. However, if the reader is looking for what the units actually did in combat, it is better to seek a different quality work that utilizes after-action reports (Scott Bowden's NAPOLEON AND AUSTERLITZ comes to mind). Thus, IMPERIAL BAYONETS will provide a basis of drill knowledge, if that is your objective."
1,Useful to a small minority,"This book to be honest is a bit of a waste of time as the reality of his calculated movement rates are fanciful at best. He gives precise step distances, for whome and where I ask. A 5'2"" man, a 6'3"" man, across rock and bush covered ground, through sparse woods, ploughed fields, mud etc etc. Its poor on the combat side and low on real facts of battles. It is not even relevent to wargames to be honest because the detail he goes into is not relevent and cannot be transfered to the tabletop."
3,pale shadows,"I really wanted to like Ms. Willig's books. I was excited when I first saw ""Pink Carnation"" on the shelves of the bookstore. But I can't read them without feeling as though I'm reading another inadequate Georgette Heyer imitator. I have never found an author who can even approach Ms. Heyer at her best, and all of them seem to use her books as source material (whether they actually do or not, it seems that way). ""Pink Carnation"", ""Black Tulip"" et al. also remind me of one of my all-time favorite books, a short, YA title called ""The Sherwood Ring"" by Elizabeth Pope. Why? Well, its that modern-girl-in-library mixed with chapters of historical fiction approach. The Sherwood Ring worked the same way. OK- accuse me of having read so much historical fiction/romance that I can't avoid seeing similarities. It's probably true, but unfortunately, although I want to love Ms. Willig's books, they seem mostly about repeating conventions, rather than adding new ingredients."
4,Fantastic Parody!,"I seem to have a knack for starting a series with the second book instead of the first,and then hopping back and forth through the run, so I appreciate a series that allows me to do that. I had no problem picking this one up and going with it, so that's a big point in its favor.What I ended up loving about it more than anything else was it's sense of fun and its willingness to skewer just about everything in its path: modern romance novels, chick lit, modern historical fiction, bodice-rippers, academia, and eighteenth century adventure and romance novels among them. It's a big leap to make your leads so clueless that they can't see that the passion they have for each other is mutual, but it pays off. I haven't laughed so much in ages."
2,Seriously lacking,"I avoided the Pink Carnation for a long time because it was a ""popular"" book, and my preferences rarely run with the crowd. Still, people assure me that popular books are popular for a reason, and so I picked it up and mostly enjoyed it.This book was a watered down version of the Pink Carnation story, and I regret that I wasted my time actually finishing it. The main characters are both cartoonish and ridiculous, and I felt as if I were being dragged through a fluffy romance novel with no semblance of a plot whatsoever. By the end of the book I was sticking with it just for the hope of a decent sex scene, but even that was ruined by the totally out of character behavior of our proper English girl, who brazenly encouraged behavior that, while normal in our times, would have been somewhat deviant back then.The book was fluffy, the spy intrigue was an afterthought, and the sex was out of character and boring to boot. Skip this one, or borrow it if you must, but don't waste your money."
1,A literary soporific,"If you have trouble sleeping you may become fond of this book. Instead of taking a sleeping pill, keep it handy on the night table. Read two or three pages, four or five at most; your eyelids will get heavy - and it's time to turn out the light and fall asleep."
2,Not as good as the first,I read the pink carnation and found it entertaining albeit hard to believe. Almost too cartoonish. This second book is just a recycling of themes and doesn't really bring any interesting characters to boot. I won't be continuing the series.
3,"Agreed, not as gripping as the first, but still quite good...","I really liked the Miles and Hen characters in the first book, and looked forward to seeing their relationship evolve, and of course more great humor and spying, and more modern romance with our historian and Colin. My complaint with the first book was that Amy and Richard seemed too stupid to be successful as spies. Perhaps my complaint was heard, as some of the outlandishness was toned back, perhaps at the cost of humor. Plot-wise, quite good, but I also got the sense that the author was stretching content to prepare for a third book. This book needed more Colin, I think. I did not laugh uncontrollably at this book, or feel as compelled to read it all in one sitting. I wish I'd waited for the paperback--tradesize like the first one."
4,don't listen to duck quack,"I am purchasing this because a friend of mind had last years edition in her library. If you do anything Duck Quack tells you to do, you will be thrown out of any publishing house in America. All of it is rude, crass and will not get you any closer to acheiving your goal. Read this book and many others, take it's advice, and stay within the realm of professional, responsible behavior--then the rest of us will not have to read complaints from editors and publishers about pushy, difficult writers who think they deserve special treatment and don't follow protocol."
1,Horrible dross,"While some of the ""Pickin On' series have been good, this one is terrible. The whole point of Pickin On was to do renditions of songs in an acoustic manner. These songs are all ruined by the constant use of drums that sound like they are on a cheap drum machine from 1983. These songs sound like they should be in TV commercials for bubble gum or something. Horrible, horrible, horrible."
5,Perfect adapter for video camcorder,"It you intend on using an external MONO microphone for your camcorder (wireless lav or mono shotgun), most consumer level camcorders will drop the audio on a single left audio channel. You are left with juggling the sound from a hard left pan and placing it properly in both channels when you edit. This isn't a problem for those that are using higher level video editors. But, if you want the quick and easy way out, get this adapter. It places the single mono audio on both left and right audio tracks in your video. It saves me tons of time in post.This adapter is a bit heavy, but clearly made quite durable. I have it attached to my external wireless lav mic's received and piped right into my camcorder. It has worked flawlessly now for 7 months. If you need to take a mono output and place it on both left and right with a stereo input, this is the little adapter for you."
2,Too much boxes and not enough inlays,As a person who is involved in Marquetry I had hoped to find some new information on inlaying but that was not to be. The boxes described will take a long time to make for most folks.
4,Good Academic Study of The History of the Agoge,"This is an excellent book about the Spartan system of educating young men (The Agoge). It looks at the way the Agoge existed in the Roman period and then traces it back through the Hellenistic period to the Archaic period. It has great coverage of the various rituals such as the Endurance contest. Occasionally, it becomes weighted down with discussion of details such as the names given to Spartan age groups. This is however within the scope of the book. It was not written so much for a general reader, though it can be read by one, but rather for someone with some knowledge of Spartan history. Overall, it is well researched and documented. Kennell reaches interesting conclusions about the Agoge's ties to society and religion."
2,Bogus Hokus Pokus,"I am a master gardener and have tried pretty much every additive, bio and synthetic supposed plant helper on the market. I have actually done controlled experiments with this product on 5 peppers (5 with 5 without) and found ABSOLUTELY NO difference with it. No difference at all! Im sure it has vitamins in it as it smells like one in the bottle but you can get better results with natural AZomite for a ton cheaper. Dont expect a jack in the beanstalk story because its not magic and its nothing special but a multi vitamin in a bottle. Its hokus pokus claims in my book. Just look at the label and see the circus and claims which are NOT proven or proof. Stick with good old fashioned compost and it will blow you away. FYI, the seller of this product Hydro Harrys is a great outlet with great products and selection. Its where I buy all of my hydroponic supplies and the ONLY reason I have given this 2 stars rather then 1. Thats has to count for somethin..."
2,Meh!,"I will give this neither a thumbs up nor thumbs down. Everything I've tried it one, I can't seem to tell any difference at all in growth or vivaciousness. I think most of it is aqueous Vit B which is cheap. Hormones? Who the heck knows. I am going to pour some on half my tomatoe plants every few weeks this summer as another test. Otherwise I have a feeling I have just been scammed."
4,Restricted?,I love this stuff and used it for years until it suddenly disappeared from Oregon. I would be interested to know why this is restricted. There is a new product from Japan HB-101 which I saw at a flower show that is supposed to be similar to Superthrive. I'm testing a sample.
5,Superthrive Is GREAT!,"This stuff works incredibly well and have already paid for itself in the trees, rose bushes and grass it has saved. It isn't a plant food it is plant vitamins and works amazingly well. A little goes a long way and when I ran out I was frantic to find more. None of the garden centers had Superthrive so I ordered it online and even saved myself 10$ including the shipping.I highly recommend Superthrive. Professionals to beginner gardeners need this super supplement for all your plants - indoor and outdoor."
4,Fun for the little ones,"Gotta love Elmo shaking his groove thing. My little guy, 1 1/2, loves it but it also gets my 5 year old dancing too!"
1,Not so great,"This mask is impossible to breath in. There are no air holes around the nose or mouth.Also, unless you have a very very large, round head, the mask will not fit properly and lose its form. What you end up with is a cat who looks like his face is melting. Not too great for a children's event. We used it recently and it was a monumental failure - the mask scared the kids and the girl we had hired to wear it fainted."
1,Belkin SurgeCube,"Should come under ""What do you expect for $6?, right? In short, cube allowed surge to destroy 18VAC power supply transformer and Mighty Mule Gate Opener control pcb. Cube LED's still glowing indicating a proper ground and protection activated. Belkin warrants the product and damaged equipment but only if reported to them within 15 days. Unfortunately it took Gates That Open, LLC, longer than that to determine the problem and I'm stuck with $300 bill if I decide to repair it. Makes me uneasy about my other Belkin surge protection products."
5,Surge protector does a great job,I have a number of these Belkin SurgeCubes in my home. They are small and perfect for individual applicances. I like not having to deal with multiple cords plugged into a strip. Good product.
3,"Single outlet surge protector is too big, but smallest could find","This is the smallest surge protector I could find on Amazon. But, it is still considerably larger than the older ones we have. The downside is that the surge protector can block access to the second part of your duplex outlet. Try plugging in into the bottom part of the outlet to make room for an unprotected plug."
4,Good product,"As far as I know, the surge protector is working. I purchased it for a new refrigerator. Our old fridge lasted a long time, but it did not have a motherboard in it. I was a bit concerned reading other reviews regarding the starting load of the fridge, as we bought a large fridge. After I researched online, I felt it would work fine. If it did not, I have many other items that need protecting, and the Cube would not go to waste. Shortly after we plugged in the new fridge (no problem with starting), we went through a series of power outages and surges. Fridge is fine, and maybe it would have been without the Belkin Surge Cube, but I felt better using it. Hopefully, I will not be back to say it did not work. As an aside - when we tried it first in a different socket - the ground light did not come on, and we found that the ground wire had come loose. Handy little Cube."
1,Dead!,"The problem with this little surge protector is that there is no reset switch. Once it dies, it is dead. Full stop. I plan on returning mine immediately."
1,Buy the cheaper one!!!!,"Buy the cheaper unit. half the price, more features, same or grater protection, same manufacturer"
4,ok product,"I ordered 2 of these, one for my refrigerator and for the air conditioner, they arrived on time, only complaint is that I wasnt able to plug the A/C because the holes dont match.... so I used it for plasma tv instead."
4,NIce to have a small option,"This is great for when you need just one like with a fridge, etc. I am happy to have it."
4,a simple surge protector,"Mine came with one of the shoe open, wont fit into the sockets so used the pliers to press the ends and now works fine. but would be better to get a multi-point surge protector if you need to connect more than one device."
2,Way Too Large,"Ridiculously large,and designed so that it will block your second outlet no matter how you place it. Pretty useless if you want to use your other outlet."
4,Solidly built,"This product is solidly built and comes with good written information. It also has 2 warning lights, one for power and one for surge protection. It plugs into the wall solidly and other items plug into it solidly. It comes with a generous guarantee, although you have to read the fine print to discover that if a given device (e.g. TV) does not also have separate surge protection for the cable, the warranty is void. No lightening strikes yet so I can't tell you how well it protects against surges."
5,Great Wax,This wax is awesome. It goes on and comes off very easy. Leaves no film and gives a good shine that lasts.
2,Didn't Think It Was That Good,"Perhaps being in the States & the book designed really for the English, I didn't find it that good at all. I know the book was written in the 90's sometime but well written books, stand the test of time"
4,great old school ghost story,"Excellent book,highly recommemded,james herbert is an excellent writer am reading the ghosts of sleath now and after that I will read ash"
3,Just okay,"Don't know why exactly this book rates in the top 100 scariest. Yes, it's well written. But, it's predictable, and not all that scary. Maybe when it was written in the '80s it was more of an original idea...."
5,Can't be criticised,"I purchased this book because I was in the mood for a good ghost story. I was not disappointed. At one point when I was reading the book, and it was a cold and blustery night outside, the telephone rang and I jumped through the ceiling! Recommend it to anyone in the mood for a good scare."
5,"ACCURATE RATING WOULD HAVE BEEN 4.5 STARS, BRILLIANT","I loved it BUT it gave me quite a few scary moments. Especially the pond scenes, and the last scene of the book with Mr. Ash was also chilling.An isolated english rural house is the setting for the psychic investigator from the Psychical Research Institute, David Ash, to unravel the claim that an old ghost is haunting the current inhabitants. David is a high skeptical paranormal consultant who does investigations trying to prove the ghosts are not real. Boy is he in for a shock!!!!!!!I have listened on audio to NOBODY TRUE by James Herbert and I gave it a 5 star. Even though HAUNTED is a small book 223 pages it is worth every bit of a read, it really grabs you in more ways than one!!!!!"
5,Read This Book,Another example of James Herbert's excellent grasp of horror. This time the ending is perfect - simply gruesome and horrifying without the excessive gore. There is also a great twist in storyline. Cool bedtime reading.
3,Interesting read.,"Honestly, I dont read much books in my spare time. I have read The Da Vinci Code and I am now reading The Exorcist. I read Haunted last Halloween and found it very interesting with a complex plot and simple characters. Some strange things occur in this book that give a slight chill to the spine but not in any sence scary, just creepy. Haunted is very easy to read, keeping you to read on until the end. Its concept, interesting story and surprising twists make this book a good read, especially its horrific ending. I would give this book 4 stars if it wasn't too boring in places.Just a good read and nothing more."
2,Deja Boo!,"David Ash is a paranormal investigator haunted by the childhood death of his sister, he finds escape at the bottom of a bottle. David is sent to debunk the claims of a haunting at the estate of the mysterious Mariell family. While there he is forced to confront his own demons while battling malevolent manifestations in the home. This character also appears in Herbert's ""Ghosts of Sleath.""Well if you've seen ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""The Others,"" (Not Herbert's ""Others) you pretty much know what's coming by the first few pages. Unfortunately, the element of surprise is the entire foundation of the book, it's what the suspense is building to. With that gone, there are no engaging characters, no sense of atmosphere, nothing to really hold the interest. Worst yet, when David falls in love it annoyed me, as there seemed no basis for it except to up the stakes for the ""surprise"" ending."
4,This book had some truly chilling moments.,"I got this book at a book fair for a buck so I got my money's worth of chills out of it and then some. I don't know what that other reader is complaining about The Others and Sixth Sense for as this book was written way before those movies ever came out!! If anything they copied him. I loved it and it gave me quite a few scary moments. Especially the pond scenes, and the last scene of the book with Mr. Ash was also chilling. So I do recommend this book to anyone who likes eerie little stories of things that go bump in the night, or the day as the case may be."
4,"I Loved The Book, But I Was Duped By The Movie!","After watching the movie, Haunted on IFC, I was determined to purchase the book. Needless to say, the movie is a bit different from the book, but I was not disappointed. James Herbert has truly mastered his craft and I look forward to becoming more familiar with his work. My recommendation, do NOT watch the movie before reading the book. Otherwise, you will be left wondering if you overlooked a few chapters."
2,Disappointing,"This is the last time I am going to read a book with a Stephen King reccomendation on the cover. After the tedious The Ruins, I thought I'd give Haunted a try. I more or less enjoyed Herbert's Sepulchre, though the twist ending was apparent about half way through the story. It didn't take nearly that long to figure this one out. There are so many things that don't work in this book it's hard to know where to start, but probably the most egregious is the pointless b-plotline that is too obviously padding inserted into a too short book. The attempted twists and turns, the cliche characterization, the back story, are all laid on so thick that this reads more like a story from the pulps of the 1930s rather than a modern novel. The main character stumbles about, noting all kinds of strange phenomena and clues without ever getting a hint of what is obvious from the first moment he steps into Edbrook. I'll give Herbert another chance or two, but I am not optimistic."
2,I don't understand all the 5 star reviews....,"I hate being the lone disenter, but while this book had some good points, it certainly wasn't great. The main character wasn't very sympathetic, the premise struck me as odd (a para-normal investigator who doesn't believe in ""ghosts"" but does believe in appartitions....what?), the relationships were underdeveloped, and the conclusion was so heavily hinted at I figured most of it out shortly after the arrival to the haunted house. I won't discuss the ending, but it also left me puzzeled, as no reason was given as to why a specific character hated the main character SO much.All in all, good atmosphere, some spooky situations, but disjointed story."
5,"Catchy pop-reggae, Brazilian style","These catchy tunes will have you tapping your toes and humming along even if you don't understand Portuguese. Most are in a light reggae-pop style, with occasional samples in English (such as ""Downtown"", a tribute to Jamaican reggae origins). These CDs can also be bought separately - I think the ""Hits"" volume is better than ""Dubs"" but both are good. Some are upbeat, some are thoughtful - ""Sabado Noite"" is rather reminiscent of some Moxy Fruvous songs. If you like UB40 and similar groups you will probably enjoy these."
5,Slammin'!,"This CD is proof positive that the rich blend of styles brewing in Brazil can satisfy even the most jaded world music listener. These cats provide thoughtful lyrics, authentic beats, and varied emotions. Twist it with a splashy, southern hemisphere vibe and... POW!... !! Gotta play it again!"
2,don't buy this product,"This kitchen is very cheap. Not durable, hard to put together and my daughter has a hard time with the cabinets and turning the knobs, would not recommend to anyone."
5,cutters,Great tools for hobbies. My Dad uses them for putting tin to make airplanes and loves them. 5 stars! Highly recommended for sure
3,expensive mailing service,"The actual mailing postage $1.64. I was charged with $5 (two packages). Also, the Vincent van Gogh bookplates are not as good as I thought."
5,BookPlate Art5,Van Gogh is an all time Favorite. I am using these in the books which I have donated to the middle school. Teacher-Librarian
2,Short Cord,Just a little note for future buyers to let them know that the cord is not 8 feet long as mentioned in the product description. It extends only 4 feet. :((
4,"Clap your hands and say, ""I believe!""","I was pleasantly surprised after purchasing this book by D.J. Conway, who seems to have gotten a bad reputation as a ""fluffy"" and ""inaccurate"" author on the market. Ever since childhood, I was always interested in fairies (the Fae) and the legends and lore surrounding them, but I didn't know which book to get to help quench my thirst for that knowledge. I will admit that I originally looked at this book for its price, which rivaled most of the other books on the Fae out on the market, and I got my money's worth for sure.With different stories about the Fae and ways to contact them, this is a great book for anyone who is just curious to know more about faeries."
3,Not a bad background reference book on the fey,"I have not given this book a 5 because that would mean it could be among the first books read about the faery and the faery path. But I would not suggest it as that. It is a good book to add within a study of the above, having read some more validated and non slanted wiccan books first.Found some major errors but all in all, this book will be helpful to perhaps to fill in spaces in the path. you just need to make sure that any of the historical facts presented that you check up on for accuracy.But as a writer she is easy to read and the reading does go fast. It flows. so that is why I gave it a 3 because IMO a 3 star means average not bad, not good but okay."
1,... Ugh...,Just another fantasy/nonsense Conway book. Stick with the authors who really *know* about Faery - such as RJ Stewart or Orion Foxwood.
5,"Delicious, child-friendly recipes","We checked this book out from the library again and again. We loved it. There are seven very 'American' children in our family, and we ate or drank every recipe we tried from this cookbook.The illustrations and descriptions were delightful. The recipes were tasty and appealing to all literary-minded children who have been permitted or encouraged from babyhood to have adventurous palates.Several recipes have been oft requested birthday favorites.Yummy. Wish it were still in print."
1,I want this book! 1 star for being OOP.,"Alright, with the recent success of the film, you'd think they'd find a way to get this back into print. There is no way I'm paying 150 dollars for a 128 page book--even if it is Narnia. I really want to have a narnian feast one of these days, so this book needs to come back into print. The Narnian (an autobiography of C.S. Lewis) was out of print and was just republished this year...so I suppose there is hope."
3,ARE WE ALONE,I would encourage people to look through these many films and buy the highest rated film out there.After one or two your wasting your money because all these films differ little between each other.Three stars is all i could give this one because i have so many of them.If this is your first film about the subject than you will most likely give it four or five stars.Do yourself a favor and stop at two.
3,Bersa Thunder Pro UC,This is the same model Bersa sells on their website for their Thunder Pro UC. I Did not like the fit for this gun and returned it.
1,Does not work with HP pavillion ze4805us laptop,"Apparently the CPU in this laptop, an AMD Athlon-XP-M causes the computer to lock up when you try to use this card to up grade this laptop to a USB 2.0."
4,"Seamless use, once it got running!","I needed to add this to my (somewhat clunky) laptop in order to get it communicating with my ""vintage"" iPod, and other peripherals I hope to get. It took a little bit of coaxing to get it installed on my Windows 2000 platform, as it kept bringing up some odd warning about compatibility not being pre-established in the software, or something like that. But I kept overriding the warning and after just a little work with it, everything is working as it should...which is more than I can say for some other supplemental connectors I've used in the past."
4,"works, more or less","This was purchased for a legacy mac laptop with usb 1 - although it works, it wasn't what I needed to run a receipt printer."
1,Buyer Beware!,This cable does not have a hot sync button! The handbook for the m100 assumes you have a hot sync button on your cable and provides no alternate instructions.
5,Good Read,"This was a very interesting book. The relationship between Jenny and Michael was realistic. Many young girls fall in love with older boys. Jenny has held on to her love for Michael for ten years after he leaves from her family home.Michael has also kept his love for Jenny and always compared other woman to her. After her father has an accident they are reunited.Many secrets are revealed and Jenny leaves with Michael to get away and think. Michael and Jenny's love is tested and they must work together in order keep the relationship going.Deidre has done an excellant job in this novel and I am looking forward to Nathan's story ""Unforgettable."""
5,Hold On To The One U LUV,"This Book was great, i loved it, it was a great love story for all the hopeless romantics out there, i cant wait to read more of deirdre savoy's books and especially Nathan's Story (Once and Again). I wish i could have started reading her work sooner, she has gotten herself a new fan, once again great book!!!!"
5,Great Story,"Jenny and Michael have known each other for years. Jenny had a crush on Michael when she was a teenager. Michael was interested in Jenny too, but knew she was too young. Fate would have it that Michael would see Jenny again after an accident her father has. Jenny's father Rusty and Michael's father Jasper have been friends since they were young men. Jenny could only love one man Michael which she nicknames Mickey.Always is a story about a love that was inevitable. Jenny always love Michael and ironically Michael figures out why he hadn't really been happy since he had to leave Jenny all those years ago. This story has family secrets and deception. A secondary story in which the author has decided to pursue is definitely present. I don't really want to say more, it might spoil the story. This is Ms. Savoy's second novel. Her first Spellbound is one of my favorites."
4,Scourby Dramatized - A Pleasant Listening Experience,"The Scourby Dramatized audio CDs are more expensive than some of their competition, and may have a the odd technical glitches, but overall are worth the purchase price. This is especially the case if you can find a sale or get a good used set. Although the music might make the words slightly harder to hear in a few areas, Scourby's voice is pleasant to listen to and seems to draw you in more than the other readers I've heard. If you are listening for more than a few minutes, the music and dramatization help hold your attention. The other dramatized audio bible I've heard is the Zondervan one. It has many of the same strenghts as the Scourby versio, but to me the reader's voice does not seem to have the same magnetic quality that is present with Scourby."
2,Quality Control - None,"Alexander Scourby is great, but I had to send the item back several times due to extremely poor audio quality. Then when I finally got the audio quality right, I found that disk 6 and 9 of the NT were exactly the same. The labels we correct, but the text from 6 was on cd 9. I finally gave up and gave the set to a friend who was happy to have it no matter what."
4,Please tour the Northwest soon!,"Ray Davies finally releases a much-anticipated record. The songs are good, and mainly what you would expect from Ray in terms of lyrical content. It's nice to hear an album of intelligent lyrics for a change. If you've managed to listen to every single regular release of every Kinks album, as I have, you'll swear you hear a passage from Low Budget (Little bit of emotion?) as well as other ""self-plaguerisms"" that Davies is famous for. As usual, it seems Ray is doing what he's always done - make a record and not worry about the commercial sucess or lack thereof. You have to respect that, for sure.This CD of course is a must-have for any fan, and hopefully after listening to this new cd, others will be interested in delving into his 40 year contribution to rock and roll."
4,Everybody's Lives,"IF I DIDN'T HAVE A CALENDER STARING ME IN THE FACE I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS THE SEVENTIES AND THIS WAS RAY'S LATEST OBSERVATION .IM NOT A HUGE FAN OF MOST OF THE LATER RELEASES BUT AM VERY PASSIONATE OF THE 60'S AND EARLY 70'S WORK AND THIS RATES RIGHT UP THERE WHILE STILL SOUNDING CURRENT.TO THE REWIEWER WHO DATED""PHOBIA"" AS 1999 IT WAS A 93 RELEASE AND WHO WOULDA THUNK IT WOULD BE THE LAST WE WOULD HEAR(AS FAR AS ALL NEW MATERIAL)FROM RAY, KINK OR SOLO,FOR OVER A DECADE. THIS LONG PROMISED SOLO EFFORT IM SURE HAS CHANGED AND EVOLVED OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS SINCE IT WAS STARTED AND ID BET A POUND NOTE THERES PLENTY OF MATERIAL AROUND FOR ANOTHER CD.THANKS RAY FOR NOT TRYING TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE ""OTHER PEOPLES MUSIC"" AND LETTING US SHARE IN YOUR(AND OUR) LIFE.WE MISSED YOU!I PURCHASED AND DOWNLOADED THIS OFF THE INTERNET,BUT I WILL BE BUYING A COPY FOR WHAT I HOPE WILL BE SOME NICE INFO AND LYRICS(HOPEFULLY) AND THIS COULD EARN THE EXTRA""STAR""."
3,He surely can do much better!!,"I got this cd, from Ray Davies, with very high hopes, and after many hearings, i can only say, that i was disapointed. Sure the great Kink master sounds happy to be alive and that shows in some of the songs. But the old Kinks magic and great melody on the songs is missing.My favorite is ""The Morning After"", great song. Let s' hope he does not wait more years to reunite The Kinks, because if he does so (record another Kinks album in some years), maybe the ""music industry"" will be so strange that there wont be cds to buy. People will only be buying one song on the internet an not complete recordins from an artist or band."
2,Bring back the kinks!!,"A year after it's release i still can't get into ""Other Peoples Lives"". No one champions Ray/The Kinks more than I, but this release is a major dissapointment. What's missing? How about melodies, no bridge on most songs, and no backing vocals worth hearing. (Bring back Rasa!). Most almost qualify as novelty numbers, which isn't neccessarily bad when you consider ""Apeman"" falls into this catagory, but there's no ""Apeman"" here! Lyrics arn't particularly compelling either. It took 10 years for this? This from a man who averaged one (usually compelling) release a year for almost 30 years!! Highlights include ""Thanksgiving Day"" (Typical Ray) and ""Is there life after Breakfeast?"". The rest is not even up too ""Preservation"" standards... Ray, please track down Dave, Mick, Nobby, and ""The Baptist"". And get busy, (Please not on Preservation Act III). How about a follow up to ""Village Green""?"
2,Review from the People in the Village,"I too found this LP uninspiring and disappointing. I won't even go on about my love for the man and his work, but there is an awful lot of sophomoric rhyming on almost every single song here. the cliches are actually a bit embarrassing at times. OK, maybe Ray wrote the originals and he's due to repeat himself, but there are times when I cringe. I have tried repeatedly to get into this LP, and it's a bit... challenging."
2,"Raise the bar, will ya Ray.","If you met me or entered my home no-one could disbute my Ray Davies-fan mania.However, like another customer reviewer, I also can't put my finger on why I dislike this album ""Other People's Lives"".Is it because it sounds over produced? Stiff and labored? Because the songs are so mediocre? (Although I found the tracks ""The Tourist"" and ""Stand Up Comic"" somewhat unique). All of the above?This recording, for me, doesn't even inspire repeated listenings (although I have tried with each listen to enjoy it).I wish someone would encourage or inspire Ray to raise the bar musically on his songwriting."
3,.............I guess.................,"Yeah, well, berate me for this, but, much as I dug the Kinks, I can't take any guy seriously who'd let that dork from ""Simple Mindz"" bird-dog Chrissie Hynde away from him. There it is. Sorry."
4,Great Book,"Van Morrison is a great artist with many talents. His songs are deeply composed and the lyrics puts you at ease, it relaxes you and encourages thought about the world around us. The beauty of our world and the enviroment in which we live in is precious"
3,this side of innocence,"This beautifully written novel, is set in one of the most intriguing times in american history. Shortly after the american civil war, as our country came brutally face to face with industrialization, no one could answer where all this progress would take us as a nation. Could this mark the end of the aristocricy and social elite, forced to make way for this new emerging american? Interwoven, into this facinating view of one priviledged families conflicts with these issues, is a story of romance, morality and personal courage."
5,Real Information vs. TV News Soaps,"Since our media and news reporting agencies have decided to do TV news soaps or fictional representations of real life, as a replacement for news, people are forced to get accurate information from other sorces. Productions such as, 'Genetically Modified Food: Panacea or Poison,' in my opinion, is a wonderfully accurate reporting documentary and, most likely, the only way people will be able to receive true information for the foreseeable future on subjects that have impact on peoples lives."
4,Not Bad At All,"My girlfriend subjected me to several albums from the French pop canon one night and though I (ignorantly) braced myself they all turned out to be decent and valid. This one by Dutronc was my favorite . Dutronc's L'Opportuniste and La Metaphore are both in heavy rotation on my iPod these days. The latter is catchy and I have no idea what it means. The former is in very easy French, the narrator admitting that he is a turncoat, falling for whatever the prevailing political fashion is, Communist, Socialist, Capitalist, etc. (a lyric unknowingly but exactly recycled later on Cafe Tacuba's Re -- El Borrego?). I was already a heavy fan of the more modern Air, Noir Desir, and Daft Punk, also French. Dutronc is more in the vein of The Kinks and Burt Bacharach. This CD is definitely worth the price."
5,a true masterpiece,"A masterpieceI read an advance copy sent to a magazine, and I gotta say this book is amazing. I have been meaning to write a review but after seeing Heru on CNN doing his thing, I was convinced I souldn't put it off any longer. The book is an incredibly intelligent story about two rival rappers as they keep crossing paths. It's realistic to the point of being painful as it shows elements of Tupac, Biggie, Nas and Jay-Z. If you love Hip-Hop then you should read this. If you don't love Hip-Hop then you need to read this to understand why the rest of us love it with such passion."
2,I don't think so!,Don't let the cover fool you. This wasnt all that. This wasn't nonah that. Please believe. The person who wrote this don't know what hip hop is. I need to write a book and let these fools no. Go get the vibe story history of hip hop to find out what hip hop is.
2,im not gonna totaly dis the book,im not gonna comlpletely dis the book cuz i wasnt bad but it wasnt a novel i could read in 1 day or anything like that like the coldest winter ever
4,Delightful,"I have to confess that I didn't know too much about these two operas when I bought the DVD. I was happily surprised. Although the recording is somehow old (1987), the sound is Stereo only and the image is 4:3, I enjoyed it very much. The production is very imaginative without being overwhelming, the singers do a real good work singing and acting (and even dancing!) and the music is just magnificent, as would be expected from a genius like Ravel. This is the only DVD available in the US that I know of. I can only hope that new productions will be recorded on DVD and Blue-Ray. L'Enfant is one of those short operas that require imagination, perfect for a production where new technology can only enhance it.Regrettably Kultur didn't include any notes with the DVD. What a shame!Highly recommended for enjoyment and to know these two short opera jewels."
4,Two delightful Ravelian stage works.,It would be a real treat if L'enfant were done in english. I'm sure young children would find this work lots of fun. L'heure is in the same class as Opera Buffa. It would appeal to fans of Rossini and Cimarosa; spicy plot and good singing. These performances are well done and quite enjoyable; but a little more Joie de Vivre would have made them A-1. JHR
4,Interesting...,"I had no idea who these guys were - I just wanted a version of the song ""Comin' Home Baby."" They delivered! They're some pretty hard rockin' musicians - the overall sound is that of a slightly refined blues bar band, but they definately put on a good show. The quality is great, and the musicianship just as good.It can sound a little clichéd at times, but sometimes, blues is. The CD is definately a great deal, though. I heartily recommend!"
5,Unusual Political Novel,"Rarely is a political novel so amusing and absorbing. It's focused on a reunion romance to boot. The author clearly knows these characters. Their interdynamics ring crystal clear and true. Eugenia's home-town reception as a new political candidate is ironically hilarious. And the fun is well-tempered by riveting suspense. Who wants to subvert Eugenia's campaign? Her former fiance who has already betrayed her once? The chief of staff who's so media-savvy and at the center of everything? The rambunctious governor? What about her ornery aunt Leoni who is always pushing her own social agenda? This novel is a richly-served treat, well-conceived and well executed. And heck, after a spring that never really came, it was great to immerse into this Midwest springtime milieu, storms and all."
4,JANE'S SPIRIT REVIVED,"I am quite pleased to see my spirit finally alive again in a romance where words are enjoyed and couples are enjoined without any resort to unnecessarily explicit actions. My own heroines were in similarly genteel though unwealthy circumstances in which more powerful forces sought to overwhelm them. Marriage was always used as a tool of sorts to which the heroine was meant to submit but to which she did not succumb unless upon her own terms.My only complaint is the imposition of postmodern vehicles so that our heroine could not entreat the hero for help on a galloping steed thereby directly encountering the springtime elements. These storms while everyone is sheltered interiorly or even under ground are less effective to be sure. I do fully understand, however, that in such a wretched setting as the American Midwest, you would have to employ a springtime season to have any effective imclemency at all. ---JANE A."
2,Rescue remedy,I have not used on my dogs yet! I gave my daughter one and I believe it helped her! She is very stressed...
5,Definitely prevents catching a bug!,"I used this recently to prevent catching a bug two friends had (nasty cough). It did the job, and the little bit of phlegm and sneezing I was experiencing DISAPPEARED! Made me happy I didn't catch it, and plan to definitely use this in the future whenever exposed to prevent catching other's bugs."
1,Item is great! Seller is not.,"PRODUCT IS GREAT!! but, I paid $20.00 extra to get this to my son at camp ASAP and it took as long as standard shipping to arrive. Seller is the problem...."
2,The verdict is still out on this item for me!,"I have a 2yr. old blind dog who sometime gets anxious when we leave him home alone, so I thought I would try this item. It hasn't seemed to help him much with his anxiousness, according to the video that I've recorded of him when we're gone, so not sure it works."
3,tastes AWFUL!,i cant tell how it works because i avoid using it because of how bad it tastes. i like the candy better!
2,"Not effective. Personally, this product did not work. Would not purchase again for myself, but perhaps would work with others.","Not effective. Personally, this product did not work. Would not purchase again for myself, but perhaps would work with others."
4,Bach Rescue,this product is very nice. seems to help me relax. may order it or similar again some time. thank you.
2,So so,"I personally felt no difference with this product. I would not necessarily recommend it based on my experience, but it may be different for each person."
2,Does it work - I suppose that's the question,"My wife was using this product for her canine massage business to help calm new 'clients' and a events where a calm atmosphere was not simple to maintain. The claims are that this will assist with anxiety in pets and help them deal with the stress of new situations.So - I think the main question here is 'does this work'.Over the course of two years and using this on dozens of dogs, the answer is 'I don't think so'.I fully understand the premise - flower essences are easier on the canine nose than essential oils - that makes logical sense. The reality here is do these specific essences work? We have seen no evidence that they do. We have researched, tested and utilized this product as directed with no noticeable result.All I can say is that in our experience over a couple of years with dozens of dogs, we don't see it being useful at all.Hope that helps."
1,Does nothing...,"I have to re-evaluate how much credibility I give to reviewers after this one. This did absolutely nothing for me. Taste's like a shot of booze. Gave it to my boss, in case she needs a ""shot"" during the day.Not recommended."
1,Didn't work for me!,"Sorry to say, this didn't work for me. In fact, seemed to make my anxiety worse! I just hope all the favorable reviews aren't by people with an investment in the company."
5,"Works for me, not my dog","My sleep is such a tenuous thing, I hate to jinx it by saying this works.....but it usually does. I take it with Source Naturals sublingual melatonin, and unless I'm too tightly wound, they help me drift off to sleep in a reasonable amount of time.That said, I have a Shih Tzu who is well behaved until a storm comes up or we take him anywhere in the car, and then he's a shivering basket case, glued to my lap. Funny thing, we used this spray on him once in the car, and the results were so dramatic that we were looking at one another and whispering, ""Did he just walk back to his crate and lie down?"" We were happy to have found something to calm him down, but since then, I've tried it on him a couple of times with no results at all. Nada. I've tried several other calming, natural meds that don't work, either.So, I'm not sure what's going on there, but I plan to keep using it for myself.....for now. Knock wood."
1,Didn't work,"Saw this from Dr. Oz show, I really believed in him. Thought it might help me with my nervousness/voice and calm me down in class presentations. It did not, it may help other but it certainly does not work on me. The taste is dominately alcohol, much like beer."
2,I'm stunned?,I don't get it? Dr Oz endorses this and says even his children use it?? It contains 27 percent alcohol?? Who wouldn't suddenly relax?
1,Full of alcohol.,Dr Oz is the one that suggested this. I think he get's a kick back on all the products that he talks about. I can tell no difference.
5,Pleasant surprise,This product is wonderful!I carry this in my purse for stressful moments and it works great!I would recommend this to anyone who needs that little push toremain calm.
3,It's all in your head,"I don't know if this product works or not. I didn't notice anything, but I let my daughter use it when she has trouble sleeping (she's six and has nightmares) and it works like a charm, but maybe it's a placebo. I'll most likely get more if only to help her sleep (which in turn helps me sleep)."
2,didn't stop my panic attack. tastes like alcohol,"I've been carrying this with me for a few weeks and have now used it for all of it's suggested purposes, including an actual panic attack.It did NOT stop my panic attack. I think it works for people who have never taken a RX medicine for panic. I have been prescribed meds in the past for anxiety and panic & I guess I expected too much of this product.The taste is like alcohol too, which I don't care for. It's 24% alcohol so that's to be expected.As far as day to day stress/anxiety I guess it was ok. If you have severe panic/anxiety, this is NOT for you."
1,Did nothing,"Bought this for my husband because he gets a lot of anxiety at school and it makes his stomach turn. He said it tasted horrible, and he's not a picky eater. He said it did nothing to calm him down."
3,Not really sure,"We got a rescue dog over a year ago. She was not socialized, had never been on grass, didn't know how to climb stairs and was fearful of everyone. She is very much improved. However she is still frightened of my husband and has anxiety attacks during thunderstorms and for firecrackers. The drops and spray help her with anxiety for storms and noises but have done nothing to reduce her fear of my husband. Any suggestions? sue"
3,Not sure what I was expecting...,"I'm not sure what I was expecting from this 'rescue' spray after seeing Dr. Oz endorse how wonderful it was to help ease anxiety (which I do suffer from) - and that this is what his family uses. Happy to hear that this was an all natural spray that is discreet to use, I thought I would try it. I can't say that it doesn't work, but I'm not sure I feel any different after taking it. I can't define if the spray is actually helping to calm the anxiety, or that simply by knowing that I've had some is 'calming' in itself. The only suggestion I can make it to try it...it might work better for you than it has for me!"
2,Watch out for expired product,Just received my Rescue Remedy Spray sold by 'Eleven Adar' and was very disappointed to see that the expiration date is 06/2009.Rescue Remedy sold at reputable health food stores has expiration dates years into the future. This is my second online vitamin shopping experience in 3 months where expired or soon to expire product was shipped.
4,Recommended for separation anxiety in dogs,"My new dog (a puppy-mill breeder) has fairly severe separation anxiety. She has ""redecorated"" during my absences. This was recommended by the rescue organization I adopted her from. Two sprays about 30 minutes before I leave and she settles down, stops her destructive behaviors and crying. With behavioral training, this has worked wonders. I recommend it highly. By the way, this is the exact same formula as the ""dog product"" and you get twice as much for a couple of dollars less."
2,Oh my 27 % alcohol,"I bought this because Dr. Oz said that it really works . I was very shocked because it has 27% alcohol. It really tastes like alcohol, my husband can not use it for he is a recovering alcoholic. I have had thought of getting it tested up at my police station wondering if I would pass a breathalyzer test. Like I said I am really shocked. I plan on writing to Dr. Oz for I have believed in every product he has promoted."
2,Front is Bent,I wish I had just returned this when we bought it and saved myself the headache. I kept it for my 3 year old daughter after spending hours assembling it. It seemed a bit off and it wasn't until we rode it that it was clear the front was not rolling straight. I am going to take it to a bike shop to see if they can fix the issue. I ranked it two stars because the style and size is great and the training wheels are far superior to those on my son's wal-mart Hot wheels bike. The price was competitive and we wanted something that we could pass on to others or keep for grandkids...we'll see if we can fix it. My daughter does like it and enjoys the pink Pyramid Pom Pom Bicycle Streamers and pink Sunlite Mini Willow Bushel Basket we added to make it more pretty.
5,Great first bike,"My mom bought this bike for my son used at a garage sale. He was riding it well before 2yo everyday on the patio which helped build some solid muscle in the legs. He loved it and it worked really well. note - The wheels are solid rubber. Waxing the paint and chrome may have a protective effect on it, there by making it last longer. Unfortunately, I had left ours out in the weather and it suffered rust on the chrome."
5,My daughter loves it,"It is pretty heavy but this is an awesome awesome bike and I can tell it's going to last a long time. Some reviewers have reviewed this product as the radio flyer tricycle... which it obviously is not. So please ignore those comments. This is a heavy duty bike that I can't wait to hand down to my son! My daughter is 3 and fits on it perfectly, she rides it every day! Good buy!"
2,crappy construction,"The right pedal should be reverse threaded so it doesn't unscrew itself as the child rides. It's not, so you have to make sure you put the right pedal in tight. The left pedal will tighten itself naturally as you ride. Any decent bicycle is designed with a reverse threaded right pedal. Also, the front headset is only a piece of nylon plastic. There are no ball bearings. This bike will last one kid, but won't make it to any antique markets. You get what you pay for. Otherwise, it works and my son loves it. I wouldn't buy it again."
3,Brief but Useful,"Billed as a commentary, this book is more a collection of verse-by-verse textual notes. The first quarter of the book is devoted to an introduction to Proverbs and subject studies of its recurring themes -- God and Man, Wisdom, The Fool, The Sluggard, The Friend, Words, The Family, and Life and Death. The notes on the text itself are frequently insightful and helpful, but if you want an in-depth analysis of the text you should look elsewhere."
5,"Worth it for ""The Metamorphosis"" alone.","Kafka was a seriously messed up guy, but ""The Metamorphosis"" is a great piece of work. The book is worth buying for this story alone."
1,"A review of the book, not the author.","Let me preface this very negative review with this: I love Kafka. He's a great author and the shortcomings of this book, this book in particular, are not his.That said, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! Whatever archaic methods the publisher, Schocken, uses to bind its books is in desperate need of revitalization. Within 1 week of purchasing this book it was threatening to fall to pieces. Within 2 weeks it became 4 volumes--it yet threatens to break into a weekly series.If you enjoy breaking the binding on your paperbacks for easy reading beware, this book is poorly bound and breaking the binding, or even opening it much past 180 degrees, will cause the book to break asunder.Buy these stories, just don't buy them in this book. Look elsewhere even if you must buy 2 or 3 other books to get everything."
5,Amazone reference is wrong,"Amazone refers to this book as ""... brings together all of Kafka's stories--those published during his lifetime and those released after his death."" No Kafka book was published while he was alive."
3,Complete????????????,"If this is the ""COMPLETE"" version of his stories why don't I see The Trial and The Castle listed? Seems ""complete"", as in ""free"", has a whole new definition these days. Buyer take note!"
5,Great product,"Very easy to apply, I polished a 2009 honda minivan in 35 minutes. Polish lasts about 3-4 weeks. Not very long but so what---- Takes longer to wash and dry then to polish!"
5,"Nice, I'm Impressed","I don't get too impressed about anything any more, but this stuff impressed me. It was by far the easiest wax that I've ever used. Just spray it on, wipe it on and let it dry, then go back and wipe it off. Make sure that you use the type of cloth that they recommend. I had the hole car waxed in 10 to 12 minutes. It looks and feels like if you had just hand waxed it with a hard to use paste wax. My car is 3 years old and I've kept it up so I don't know how well this wax will work on a car that has not been waxed or that is faded. And this is the first time that I've used it so I don't know how well it will hold up over time. But even if I have to wax it more often, it sure makes the job a lot easer. If you don't have the time or energy to wax your car with the harder to use waxes, then try this stuff, I think that you'll be impressed too."
2,liquid diamond..... nothing special,I bought this for my car that is oxidized because the commercial said it would take it out and shows that is does! Well it does not. It didn't do anything. Don't waste your money or time. you can pick something up at the local parts store that works better!
1,NOT as seen on TV,"I saw on the commercial that after one application, an old car looks like new... well, I tried on my old car and didn't improve at all."
4,Liquid Diamond,"What can I say but, IT WORKS! I have a '93 Honda. My neighbor said it looks like a different Car. It shines, the water still beads and its been 3 weeks since I plished it."
1,Simonize Liquid Glaze,"What a waste. I expected more from the product. Used it on an 04 BMW and an 07 Vette. Required as much elbow grease to remove and polish to a high shine as any paste wax. The battery operated spray bottle is cool, but the product is inferior. I would take a refund if offered."
1,disappointing,this product is nothing more than a liquid spray that does little to nothing when applied to your auto. it appeared no more effective than water. i felt it was a total waste of time and money.
1,Terrible,This product isn't even worth being on the market. I might as well use water from a hose. I am very dissatisfied with this product. I would not recommend this to my worst enemy yet alone a friend. Terrible product not worthy of all the hipe.
5,Wow!,"I had known from ""Peter Pan"" and ""The Little Minister"" that Barrie was a great author, but I think this is the best I've read of his, so far.He manages to create one of those characters that you love despite (because of?) his faults, and he surrounds him with a great supporting cast and many subplots. I recommend this highly to anyone who likes Barrie's work (or as an introduction to it)."
2,"Kind of good, but not much news about his kid life","This book was OK. But, I read another one that was way better. It mostly told about life about basketball, not about his real life. And I think it didn't tell very much about him. I guess you could say the book is OK for just reading to get to know more about his basketball life."
5,The Dark-Horse of Pocket Guides,"In contrast to its ubiquitous cousin, the Tarascon Pharmacopoeia, this book is infrequently used and is a relative unknown amongst my colleagues. That's a shame, because this book provides a wealth of useful, easily accessible information. Despite the fact that I carry other databases including my own notes or ""peripheral brain"" on my handheld, this book provides me with answers I don't find anywhere else.The information is broad and varied including the bread and butter differential diagnoses of mixed acid-base disorders, to ventilator weaning parameters, PIOPED data, rheumatologic autoantibodies and in what diseases a given antibody is prominent as well as the criteria for fluid analysis of any type (e.g. joint, CSF, pleural, ascites, etc.), EKG criteria et cetera ad naseum. As a quick, information packed reference, it's easily worth the small amount it costs."
3,too early to say,"I've flipped through it, and it looks pretty tough to read. I'll give it a good trial run here in a few months. I'm not a big iPhone person. I like books."
1,Limited Lifetime,Not worth the money spent. At 2 years a leak was discovered. Repaired and at three years another leak was found. Replacing with another brand. (Stiebel)
2,Bad customer service,"I am having to replace the motherboard/computer twice due to a leak that should not occur. The leak is at part #6, the water detection screw hole. With this second motherboard that I am trying to order, I cannot get a response back. I've emailed and called and left voicemail messages (with Anthony) and no one will get back to me at Seisco's customer service. Aweful. Given that most of the models are very poorly rated, you would think that the customer service might compesate. I suppose Seisco sucks all the way around. I am going to redo the radiant floor heating with a water heater instead."
4,works great,"I didn't think i would find this for a camera as old as mine. I bought the lens and adapter shortly after buying the camera and my wife broke it. All cameras should have a wide angle as well as a zoom, but they don't. so this is a necessity in my opinion."
2,Unwieldy adapter,"In a rush of enthusiasm I ordered this Sony lens adapter and the telephoto lens. Over time and use (less and less), I have found it inconvenient to change from regular camera usage to the higher powered lens. Think about this one and be less enthusiastic to begin with...."
4,Expectations,"Simply put the VAD-PHC Lens Adapter does just what it is supposed to do, that is, provide a base onto which I can mount particular lenses onto my camera. My only wish is that it could be made either a bit sturdier or a more compact."
2,At chap.18 the author forgot to include Windows instructions,"This book was good until Chapter 18 - which is where the How-to of creating rollovers begins. Beginning in Chapter 18, the author forgot she was writting for a Windows and Mac book and only wrote Mac instructions which are of course, very different from Windows. I had to use the tutorial which came with my Fireworks software to figure out how to do a rollover - so in effect, I wasted my time & money with this book. My advice is to look elsewhere for a Fireworks book."
3,"Overrated, as all Visual QuickStart Books are!",There really isn't much in this book that you can't figure out by yourself by playing around with the program for a few hours. Only if you're true beginner then you may want to pick up this book. The step by step introduction is excellent.
2,Not Happy,I thought that my purchase was satisfactory until I attempted to turn to page 1081 at the request of my Professor and realized that pp. 1081 - 1088 of the Model Penal Code were missing (removed). How embarrassing!!!!I wish I would have been told this tidbit of information PRIOR TO the purchase.I would not purchase from this individual again.
1,No answer,"I have submitted an urgent message asking when i can realistically expect my delivery, in case i need to cancel my order and no response."
2,Poor design,Won't hold regular size lead length. Lead breaks. Stylus wobbles in barrel under routine use.
5,really perfect,I am very satisified with this product. I got it as a christmas present and viewed it to see if it would work. Works perfectly with both audio and video and is well worth the money that was spent on it.
4,Fresh look at post-revolution politics,"This book is perhaps one of the more original memoirs of Iran out there, in that it is less a personal history than a series of encounters with the people who got or didn't get the revolution they fought for in 1979. At times his subjects can be infuriating, as de Bellaigue really introduces readers to people who do not hide their fundamentalism. On the other hand it's what makes this account so fresh and new, that he talks to people others seem to avoid. The structure is a bit too loose and I'd prefer a bit more of his own ""story"" but this memoir is certainly worth visiting, especially for those with an interest in the Iran-Iraq war."
4,Girls ARE meant to be scientists!,"Denise, a 10-year-old girl, wants to explore mold under her new microscope. Her efforts to secretly create specimens are quickly ""outed"" when Mama catches a whiff of the foul odor. This is the first volume in a picture book that encourages kids to explore science.The story is simple; what makes the book great is the informative material in the back--including instructions on growing your own mold. Buy this book, especially if there is a young and/or precocious girl in your life."
5,From The Heart,This book is a treasure. The author has reached back in time to a place in her mother's childhood. She writes about the subject in a simple heartfelt way that any child or adult can relate to. I found the Lesson Plans in the back of the book perfect for home schooling or extra credit projects. All five of my grandchildren love their copies and read them over and over again.
5,fabric grabbers,"the work just super, I put them all on my rulers and they do hold the fabric really great"
4,supplement,Book is excellent for a supplement understanding. Many of times I have not understood something in the chapter to the fullest and I turn to the book. After doing so it has became much clearer. In each section there is a further teaching of sections with problems described using different words which helps
4,for school,"Good book but old. It helped me get through chem with a little extra help. I would get the newer version of the book though, newer info."
5,Lovely bookplates!,"These are wonderful bookplates;--can't decide whether to keep them or give them to a friend, but they're a perfect little gift for an avid reader who generously lends me books."
3,Good slippers,"I gave it a 3 star only because I was hoping to use it for regular walking but obviously I was wrong. For shoes to the beach only, I'd give it 5 stars. You can take the cushion out so it won't get wet. But walking on the boardwalk for a prolonged period might hurt your feet."
3,"Charismatic and Imperfect, Human","I've been a big fan of Klein's previous work on Primary Colors and was looking forward to reading a book that might shed some light into Clinton's strengths and weaknesses. Although the book was interesting and informative, there were no surprises or new insights. If you are looking for an introduction to the Clinton administration or just a new perspective on his character, The Natural was great."
4,Interesting,"If you want an insider or inside the beltway look at the clinton presidency, this book is sure to satisfy. If you want a look at the flaws and strenghts of current boomer generation of politicians, this is sure to satisfy as well.Klein does a good job of looking at clinton within the context of the whole, the modern bloodsport of politics, the games the spin and how clinton mastered and ran amok by these things. If a clinton sympathizer this book will have you cheering at times, boiling at other times. If you are jaded by politics today, you will be 'emerald' after reading this book.However,I think he is too forgiving of Clinton's tendency to self destruct due to his own personal/character weaknesses. He is too generous in his analysis when he begins to explain why clinton failed because 'He was never really tested'...and at times I think he still struggles with TB-itis (reference from primary colors)."
5,A very Objective Look at Clinton,"I have to admit that Klein's book about the Clinton presidency is one of the most objective accounts of Clinton I have ever seen. Although friendly with the ex-prez, Klein pulls no punches and presents Clinton's presidency warts and all. In the end we all know what Clinton did, but Klein gives us more insight as to the ""whys"" of his actions. Is Clinton the greatest president of all time? No. Is he the worst? Not even close. If all books on presidents were written as objectively as this one, we would all have a better understanding of what makes these men tick.Is Clinton a better president than W? You tell me: peace and prosperity vs. war, a declining stock market, and skyrocketing gas prices."
4,Pleasurable Read,"The book shows that a journalist wrote it. That wasn't meant to be as backhanded as it seems. The stories about Clinton et al are those we can recall, this isn't a back room exposé full of conspiracy theory.A good journalist (at least) writes as if he has something to tell you. Only in the last chapter does Klein really subject the reader to an opinion piece.If you were alive at all for the eight years of Clinton's presidency then...no, none of this is really ""new"" or ""insightful"" but I, for one, found it none the less interesting."
4,I love this!,"When I was really young, I used to bet the other children that I could swallow loose change. The most I ever did was 78 cents and one of them was a quarter."
1,The Natural,"I will buy this book for my library for it's view, however not until it is on the bargain table at Sam's for fifty cents."
2,Jumble Book,"I just recently purchased this book. I have to say I was disappointed. Although there were some nice pictures I found her style to be jumbled.Very few ideas, and those that are there looks like an afterthought. I enjoy bohemian,ecclectic decorating but his was too jumbled. If you want it, buy it used."
1,there are far better books out there,"I got this book, and realized I made a mistake almost immediately.I gave it a chance. I really did.But the photography was completly insane. Grossly over done - wide apertures, etc. And what you want to see was not clear.So, don't buy this book expecting to see anything useful. Besides not being able to actually see the ideas, they are so [bad]. What do you want to cover a tin can with fabric for? Buttons on lampshades? Yuck!"
5,Tracy Porter's Home Style,"I have all of Tracy Porter's decorating and entertaining books. If you like decorating your home and want fresh ideas, you must have this book!"
2,nothing new,"I have to say I was disappointed with this book. I can't believe that Tracy Porter can live in a house decorated like hers with three small children. She must be living in a fantasy world just as she aspires to. I actually did read through the whole book and found nothing unusual or creative in Tracy's tips section or in the ""make it section"". In fact, maybe I should write a book. It seems anybody can."
2,"As seen on TV, or even more comercial?","The running time is supposed to be about one houre, but about half of the time you'll see trailers for other DVDs, which you can't even skip.The DVD is giving you some good pictures, but the sound is trash, and there are hardly any information.I wouldn't buy it again."
2,not too good,"This item is not too good. The sound quality is poor and most of the lights don't work. It seems like it would hold together with a lot of use, but I can't tell since it doesn't work. Not too fun. Maybe I got a lemon, but I would not recommend this item."
2,Loved it!,"These books are my escape from reality into a world I would have loved living in, (I think). I love all of Louis L'Amour's books"
4,A good L'Amour read,"This poor man! A long struggle with doubt and subtrifuge but as always, the good guys win out at the end."
3,Great western,Another great western by Louis L'Amour. I used to read a lot of his stuff years ago but stopped for some reason. This book made me remember how much I loved his writing.
3,"It works, but I would not buy it again","There is really not a whole lot of positive I can say about this thing. It works as it should, the cord is long, and the price is good. That's about all the good I can think of. It fulfills its life as a surge protector. However, there is nothing great about this product. It is way too fat and the cord is too thick and unwieldy. Not good qualities for a surge protector that is going to be out in the open. The plug is a standard plug, not a flat one (why do they still do that). Combine that with a thick cord and it becomes very hard to have it be plugged into a tough to access outlet. Also, all but one of the outlets are right next to each other, so do not think about using it for something that has big bulky plugs.Would I buy it again... no. I would pay a tad bit more and get something that is much more useful."
1,It blew out,I only had one thing plugged into it and it lasted two days and then he just blew out and stopped working so I wasted my money on the thing.
4,Worked when hit by a surge,My daughter actually had many items plugged in to this and blew the fuse in it. But the electronics were safe. Would buy again at the good price I had before.
3,It was just o.k.,"In my opinion, it was just o.k. it didn't have what a good book should have which is a good ending. Try it, you may like it."
3,Ok,"It had some funny parts in it. From the description it seems like it would be hilarious, but not exactly."
2,"Wasn't funny enough, wait for it on HBO.","I was expecting more comedy, wasn't really funny.I watched the entire thing on a amazon video credit, So glad I didn't pay for it.If you have nothing else to do and a free credit from amazon, then get it.If not, wait for it on HBO."
4,Bought for a 2yr old!,"Beautiful looking bike. Just the right size for my 3yr old son! Actually, all of my 3 kids have just loved it. My oldest is six and she can ride it as well. Only downfall is that it only lasted a year. The chain keeps coming off and it would be much more expensive to fix than to replace. My two year old has figured it out and I may buy another one for him this Christmas. PS...Of course it has no breaks! These bikes are only meant to train babies!!! Whoever leaves their two year olds unattended while riding is an unresponsible parent anyways!"
1,Too small for 3-4 year olds,I bought this bike thinking it was the next step up from a tricycle. I wanted a small bike so that it would be easier for my daughter to learn to ride first. I figured she would grow out of it in a year but didn't mind since my son could use it next. (I had a hard time finding a gender neutral bike otherwise.)The bike was like those bikes you see in the circus where the rider is riding a teeny-tiny bike. It looked like a toy.This is the only gripe I have with buying something online. You can't really judge the size online.If you want this for a 2 year old (instead of a tricycle) it would be fine. Anyone older I would say it is a total waste of money.
5,Great Bike!,This is a great bike for a little one. My son just turned two and is riding it everywhere. Because it is small and a bike he has an easier time reaching the pedals than on a tricycle where the pedals are on the wheel. He has a tricycle at his grandmother's house but can ride this much better. The tricycle seems to tip over easily. He has only tipped this over once. Since he is two we have the seat on the lowest setting. It was still just a little too tall so we removed the red plastic piece from under the seat and it's a perfect fit. With the seat being adjustable he will be able to ride this for quite awhile. He also loves that it's just like all the other big kids bikes in the neighborhood.
2,"Adorable but way too heavy (and, no, there are no breaks....","We bought this bike for our son a year ago, for his third birthday. I liked that it was a nice small size and the look was gender neutral and gorgeous. However, we have been very disappointed with the bike's performance. It is just so HEAVY. My son has a really hard time getting going on it and going uphill just doesn't seem to work for him on this bike. One mistake that I won't make again is trying to surprise him with the bike and not trying it out ahead of time in the store. We will soon buy him a new bike and this time will take him to a real bike shop to be fitted and to try out the bike."
2,"Cute, til it fell apart!","I purchased this bike for my son on clearance at Target for $[...]. You get what you pay for!I kept it outside, well it is a bike...an outside toy! It rusted in no time, wish I had known that prior, I would have sprayed it with some rustoleum first. But that's not the worst of it, the brace plate covering the chain fell off within 2 weeks and so did the plates that cover the top part of the wheels. No more protection for my son's fingers. This is actually a real cute bike and easy for my son to ride, but it is made real junky...I would have expected much more from an old company with a gret reputation (why I purchased this brand). I have the plastic wagon and it has held up great, easy to wash down and it hasn't fallen apart...perhaps b/c it is plastic and not metal. Overall, I was disappointed in this purchase. Looking to buy a bew bike for my son now."
5,Great Bike,I would recommend this bike to anyone. We bought this bike for my daughter on her 2nd birthday in August. My daughter is more petite than children her age and this bike was just right for her at this age now and will be perfect next summer when we take her out riding. She LOVES the bell (as does all the children around) and can easily maneuver the bike around corners. It looks like a classy bike. Both parents and children have complimented the bikes appearance and quality.
1,It died.,"I had this unit for about a year, and it died. I am very disappointed in the quality of this product and won't buy Belkin again. Belkin said I could return it, but I had to pay for shipping. It was cheaper to buy an APC that did far more than to deal with returning this product. I like APC."
3,DOES NOT PLUG INTO THE WALL,I am returning this surge item because it doesn't plug into the wall. The pictures and the description do not make that clear.
1,"deceptive description, misleading photograph","Had to return this product when it would not mount on a wall socket to protect against wall current surges, which is what you would expect with the product name and appearance in the photo. Maybe it does what other reviewers claim, but it does not do the most obvious function you would expect."
2,Not what I thought it was,"This is probably totally my fault, but I feel like this could have happened to anyone. I looked at the picture of this and thought it was something you could plug into the wall to get more outlets out of one outlet. That is not the case. I have no idea what it actually does (something to do with modems and/or phones because it has a bunch of phone jacks on it) since I don't see how you can even supply it power. So, take heed and make sure you actually know what this is before you order it."
1,Live performances are not what Deep Forest excels at...,"I find this album unlistenable. As someone who enjoys the first album (Deep Forest), and even parts of the second (Boheme), but detests the third (Comparsa), I had my doubts before listening to ""Made in Japan."" Unfortunately, these doubts were well founded.Most of Deep Forest's appeal comes from their meticulous manipulation of samples and the rich, spacious atmosphere of their recordings. This live album strips away all of that, leaving behind mere skeletons of the original songs.The vocal samples (which are the most fun part of DF's albums) are replaced by live people who cannot replicate the exotic otherworldly-ness of the originals.The result is a painful hodgepodge of keyboard noodling and cheerful-but-awful imitations of DF's original tracks. Sad but true."
5,A beautiful album,"This is my first review at Amazon ever, and that's just because i love this album. It's so trong and emotional, makes me laugh and cry. It's just so beautiful! The performance is very genuine, they seemed to have a good time that evening in Japan. I like this recoding better then the studio recordings."
2,DEEP FORREST,WELL I LIKE THEIR CD BUT I WAS DISSAPOINTED BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE LIVE PERFORMANCES ON CDS WHERE EVERYONE IS CLAPPING AND SHOUTING. I LIKE THE VERSIONS WHERE THEY ARE IN THE STUDIO AND EVERYTHING IS PEACEFUL. I WOULD HAVE MUCH PREFERRED THE STUDIO VERSION BETTER.
2,Doesn't do much for me,"I had heard a couple of Deep Forest's numbers on youtube and liked them, so I picked this album up. Unfortunately, though, I didn't like it.I don't exactly know how to describe it. There are a lot of diverse sounds, and someone is singing, perhaps in some foreign language, or perhaps just in syllables, I don't know. There are some kind of rock guitar interludes, but that's not the whole thing. There are audience noises.Perhaps it was different if you were there in the audience, or perhaps I'm too old for this -- or perhaps I just like a different sound."
5,Enjoy it!,"A real great and enjoyable live album recorded in Tokio, Japan. Each track better than the other one! Deep Forest, go on like this! Hope to hear you once live in Switzerland as well!"
2,mediocre Crumb - a disappointment,"The cover says it's the Creme de la Crumb.I disagree.When Crumb is at his best, as in Fritz the Cat,the Mr. Natural/Flakey Foont tales, or in_Plunge_Into_The_Depths_Of_Despair_, he's alternatelyangry, funny, thought-provoking, and Zen.If I were emperor of the universe,his ""A Short History of America""would be given to every kid in school.This collection misses most of what made Crumba sometimes delight, and includes much mediocrematerial (pages of tiny panels that don't tella story -- of interest to amhphetamine freaks,I guess)."
4,This ain't your run-o-the-mill coffee table book,"Attention to anyone who wants the most in depth insight into japanese shock cinema that money can buy. This is a neat book with everything you wanted to know about japanese films featuring bizarre sex and violence in a world where there is no deliniation between the two. Good info and terrific pictures, this one is sure to be the hit of the tea party."
4,Explore Japanese cinema without boundaries,"Jack Hunter states in his introduction that one of the only things that Japanese cinema bans is the depiction of genitalia, and states that this sole barrier has brought something that is lacking in the West: an absence of boundaries.For his book, Hunter has chosen to explore blood, sex and madness as themes running through Japanese films. For the average film viewer, chances are the only film they will have seen or heard of in this book is ""In the Realm of the Senses."" For the Japanese film connoisseur, this book is one of THE handbooks.Chapters detail film genres along with specific directors who have shaped the modern Japan film industry. There are also tons of black and white pictures, showing personalities as well as scenes from the many movies."
2,This specific model doesn't fit a 2003 explorer,"I've used Wagner brake pads on all my cars and I love them, they've never let me down. I recommend them to anyone you will feel a difference in stopping distance. Just dont buy this model on a 2003 explorer they are too small"
3,Holiday Music,"A truly wonderful collection of instrumental holiday music with the sounds of traditional mountain instruments, especially the mandolin."
4,Norwegians will like this book,This book is about Norwegians in the late 19th Century. It is a nice family book. I enjoyed reading it as my family came over from Norway and settled in Minneapolis the same as the people in the book did. Quite a coincidence as I knew nothing of the book or author when I bought it at a used book sale. Another gem!
3,This is a great book,I would like to say that I have read this book and I think that this is not boring at all and tells us a lot about the olden days in Greece. This is a great tragedy and it is indeed very interesting to read.
4,"Anyone who thinks ""Odeipus the King"" is boring is ignorant!","""Oedipus the King"" is a fasinating novel dripping with drammatic irony, it not only teaches readers how to read and understand difficuly text but also facts about the Greek God's and culture. IT IS NOT BORING!!! Anyone who says so is ignorant and obviously uneducated! If you are that type of person that likes to read novels that are challenging and learn a thing or two, then ""Oedipus the King"" is right for you. However, I do not recommend it to anyone who does not appreciate good literature like Shakespeare, Yeates, Sophcoles, Aeschylus and so on."
2,Oedipus review,"Oedipus was a weird book to reab, because the plot was all twisted. The characters in the book are nasty. Oedipus kills his father and has two kids with his mother....."
1,Virtiolic arrogant dead man tells all.,"States tha engineers are born. Not made. Same sort of mindset that wants to invade india for its rubies and salt. Ancient, flawed reasoning."
2,Jesus Christ did exist!,"The assertion that Jesus Christ never existed is beyond ridiculous. Whether you accept Him as your savior or not, his existence is thoroughly documented in many sources, including from those who were hostile to him and would have preferred he didn't exist - the Romans and the Jews. We have many reliable ancient Roman and Jewish texts from the time period of Jesus that corroborate his life and the message of the Gospels.Only the most rabid, fanatical atheists deny the existence of Jesus. For factual information corroborating the existence of Jesus, I recommend ""The Case for Christ"" by Lee Strobel."
4,A Good Read,"This is worth the read, ""Lonesome Dove"" it's not but a different era, different attitudes. I still liked it"
1,PRETTY BOY FLOYD (LARRY MCMURTRY AND DIANA OSSANA,"THIS BOOK IS NOT PROOF READ PRIER TO SALES.BAD SPELLING, NEW PARAGRAPHS WHICH JUMP FROM ON END OF THE STORY INTO ANOTHER FIELD ALL TOGETHER WITH OUT ENDING OR STARTING THE STORY.THE WRITERS TREAT THERE READERS LIKE THEY ARE CHILDREN AND THIS IS A CHILDS STORY SO THEY PUT IT INTO CHILD READING TERMS.THIS BOOK NEVER GETS OUT OF THE BORING STAGES AND INTO MORE INTERESTING READING ABOUT HIM UNTIL THE LAST FEW PAGES OF THE WHOLE BOOK."
2,"Sorry, Larry....you're much better as a solo act","Since Larry McMurtry was listed as one of the authors of this book, I picked it up and thought I would enjoy it. Boy, was I ever wrong. ""Lonesome Dove"" was a masterpiece, and so are the other McMurtry books I've read - but this, by comparison, is amateur night. The writing is stiff and reads like something McMurtry might have written when he was just starting out - and then threw in the trash.Forgive me, Mr. McMurtry, but you're much better as a solo act, and I'm only sorry that you're not going to write any more novels about that wonderful pair, Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call."
2,uninteresting,"McMurtry and Ossana have written a novel that is wholly uninteresting. I'm given to believe that Pretty Boy Floyd is something of a legend, and this novel does very little to tell me why he attained that status. Most of the novel focuses on his exploits with various lovers, rather than on his bank-robbing, which would be fine if there were any more depth to the romantic entanglements than there is to the short-shrifted heists. Worst of all, Floyd himself is a blank. We don't understand why the people close to him remain devoted to him, and therefore I have no idea why I should care about him. All in all, this is a boring novel, and a big disappointment given that one of the authors is McMurtry, who is one of the better novelists America has ever produced."
3,It's ok,"The dialog is stilted, and the plot seems to repeat itself over and over...rob bank, spend time with wife/girlfriends, someone dies. Repeat. But, it was well written and there was some interest in the characters."
4,Fine,"This book is one that I bought at the last minute because of an apple cake recipe that I had been told was wonderful. When I made the recipe, in my opinion it was lacking on several levels and that of course put a damper on enthusiastically trying other recipes. I will give it a go at some point. This is not one of those books that I will be using on a regular basis."
2,My headline is that Amazon never managed to get this to me!,"I ordered this. I received a 'brochure' type thing that appeared to go with a Britannica encyclopedia. I sent it back. I then received the CD-ROM for this, and not the book. It is a CD-ROM for a PC, and I have a Mac. I sent it back (again having talked to someone at Amazon about the problem). I then received the CD-ROM for PC AGAIN. I told whomever I spoke wth in customer service that I wasn't going to send it back, but that I wanted my money back. So this is how it was left. Gee, I wish there was some way I could get the book! I can't order it from you!"
5,Knock your socks off,"Even if you think you know Italian dry mushrooms -- order these and find out how wrong you were. Unbelievably beautiful, deeply fragrant, terrific huge intact slices. Flip all the cards over: these completely redefine the category. Not just for sauces: soak a few to garnish your steak. Make a knockout appetizer with these porcini, some stock and a shot of marsala. To top it all: the price is reasonable. Bravo!"
1,Not Italian or French,"When I bought these mushrooms before, they were clearly labled ""from Italy"". This time, the origin is not mentioned on the bag, and when I checked their website, I see they've written a bunch of malarky about how porcinis'taste the same wherever they're from, even from North America or China. That is just not true. Porcini from Europe taste better: the terroir changes the mushroom's flavor considerably, just as it changes the flavor of grapes made into wine. Since JR Mushrooms refuses to reveal their country of origin, I must assume they are selling cheaper, possibly contaminated mushrooms from China in order to make a bigger profit. Beware! Buy another brand."
5,The best DVD on the subject out there.,"I own probably 10 UFO dvd's - - and this one, by far, is the best of all of them ! The interview with Colonel Philip Corso in the ""special bonus material"" section was truly superb. GREAT research went into this marvelous movie. This DVD won two EBE awards. From Area 51, to Roswell, to Gerald Ford's memoirs to the never-ending governmental cover-ups, this DVD will hold your interest for the entire 2-hours ! A MUST PURCHASE !!"
1,skip it,This dvd is only 48 min. long-and repeats the SAME program when it is done-special feature interviews added don't even add up to the 120 minutes it claims on the box-for in the know students of ufology-it offers no new info-
3,50 minutes of nothing new,This documentary contains little or no information or footage that warrants spending time watching it unless one is thoroughly new to the subject and wants a brief and concise introduction.
5,I loved this book!,"I was originally required to read this book for my English class, but I ended up really enjoying it. Sherman Alexie is an outstanding author and I plan on reading more of his work. I think everyone should read it!!"
4,Comedy and Confusion,"As I read this book, I realized it was one of those texts which you had to finish. If you said you only read half of it, I won't believe you! This book introduces us to a whole range of characters (American Indians) living on a reservation. Sherman Alexie takes us into their lives, which is filled with humour, and also frustration. My favorite character was Victor. I liked him because he has a huge history and rich culture... and it mixes with the new western civilization. We also see how he developes, so it was interesting. All in all, if you are remotely interested in learning about the difficulties of a ""coming of age"" in the US, or just looking for a few hard-to-put-down tales about Native Americans... buy this book."
2,Very disappointing,The author's introduction is well worth reading; it made me want to jump into the book. This book could only have received a lot of attention because of the author and unique title. Must have been very cathartic for author S. Alexi. Very disappointing. My two stars are only for the writing. One or two of the stories would have been more than enough for me.
5,Lovely and Poignant,"I totally adore this book. I first read it in 1994 as a Freshman in High School. It's how I fell in love with Sherman Alexie (he spoke at my graduation last year at the University of Washington and was FABULOUS!!). It's such a lyrical story, the vignettes are lovely, very poignant.I love Thomas Builds-The-Fire so MUCH!! It makes me so sad the way in which he is received by most people in this book. His stories are so precious and important, I want to blast them over loud speakers!!So glad I re-read this. Such a beautiful string of intertwined vignettes, even when discussing UN-beautiful things, Alexie's poetic words caress my tongue and brain. Ahhhhh....Good Stuff. Very Powerful. Everyone should read this, at least once."
5,As fascinating as it is educational,"The book is a collection of short stories whose characters keep returning. There is no single plot, although Victor comes closest to being the protagonist. The stories feature residents of the Spokane Reservation and convey the current state of the American Indian: mostly depressing. Alexie, however, tells his people's stories in such a desperately real yet humorous way that it is as fascinating as it is educational (for most of us). I have always appreciated gallows humor."
2,no,Not the greatest book but I needed it for class so I had no choice but to buy it. Don/t recommend
3,a good first collection,"alexie's first collection is a pretty good one. the stories are generally short and all are interrelated. it's the strongest work he's done, and likely always will be."
2,?,"I found this book to have interesting parts but it was pretty confusing and thats why i put a question mark for the title. If the book had one focused theme or if the author made it easier for you to be able to tell who the narrator is it would have been a much more understood book and easier. The author would give good detailed conversations. Such as when they took a drug and they were describing what they saw. It made the reader seem as if he was right there listening to the conversation. The author could have been a little more thoughtful of how well the reader would understand the book. He had no central plot and and it kind of seemed more like some type of a documentary were they just record daily, what the characters do. Overall it was an ok book, but it could have been reader friendly and have some type of theme or plot that sticks out more boldly."
5,Great read,"A collection of short stories written by a local American Indian, Sherman Alexie that will bring you to a different world. Even though the stories are fiction, they are based on things he's seen and experienced. Some of the stories in this collection are a little boring, or too deep for some to catch. But most of them are worth reading more than once. For example: ""A Drug Called Tradition"", ""Because My Father Always Said He Was they Only Indian Who Saw Jimi Hendrix Play `The Star Spangled Banner' at Woodstock"", ""All I Wanted to Do Was Dance"", ""The Trial of Thomas Builds-the-Fire"", and many others."
4,Alexie is an inspiration!,"I read this book, expecting it to be exactly like ""Smoke Signals"", it wasn't but I still enjoyed it. His writing style inspired me to take a look at my own, and change it around a little bit, as a result, my fiction writing couldn't be better!"
5,Excellent!,"I started reading this book out of curiosity and I just could not stop. It is both hilarious and moving in equally profound ways; altogether, great reading. I loved it. It made me want to read more of Alexie's work. And I have."
1,Parents Beware!,"My son was required to read this book for his freshman high school class. It is full of the f-word and other foul language. It also is replete with drugs, binge drinking, and overt sexual situations among teens. I am totally mystified as to why this book is taught in schools AT ALL! It sends mixed messages to teens, who are very vulnerable to such powerful imagery and may be influenced by it. Why fill our children's minds with garbage when there are so many brilliant and inspiring books to choose from?"
4,the Barnabas/Adam connection,"While Barnabas Collins and Julia Hoffman try to determine how the creation of Adam has cured Barnabas of his vampirism, Carolyn Stoddard hides the man-made creation in the closed-off west wing of Collinwood.Warlock Nicholas Blair causes Angelique's hands to age, and threatens to destroy her unless she returns the vampire curse to Barnabas. Angelique learns of the mysterious connection between Barnabas and Adam."
5,Ethan and Anna will win your heart...,"In the sequel to The Seduction of His Wife Janet Chapman focuses on Ethan Knight. Ethan is set to take over the family's new acquisition, a sawmill. After being fired by the mill's foreman for a stupid accident prior to the sale of the sawmill, he is holding a small grudge. Not only does he end up keeping the foreman, but unknowingly rents a cottage on her property as well.Anna had a huge crush on Ethan when she was young and he saved her. Her grandfather shipped her off to her father after ""the incident."" He did it for her own good, but Anna is just now figuring that part out, after his death. She's gotten past her childhood traumas, but can't get past her crush on Ethan. The fact that he keeps saving her doesn't help.A great story, and a beautiful addition to the series."
1,HELLO Rust!,"As soon as I started washing these knives in the dishwasher, they began to rust. Not to mention, I couldn't cut through a carrot without pushing down as hard as I could. Purchased at Kohl's so I'm thankful they have a 365 day return policy."
2,J.A. Henckels,"I purchased this set from a now defunct seller. I had a GREAT experience with a set of dusty rose colored handle J.A. Henckels knife set 20 years ago. Unfortunately, some of the knives from that set disappeared, so I decided to replace my old set w/a a more modern, new black/stainless steel look. Bad choice, these rusted almost immediately. My previous dusty rose set was washed in the dishwasher and after 20 years, still have not rusted and are sharp and sturdy. I am very disappointed in this new modern set. They still handle well, cut, but I am constantly (even with handwashing) trying to remove rust stains. Thankfully, I still have a few of my old dusty rose set!"
1,Low quality knives,"I purchased these because I was familiar with J.A. Henckels and associated the name with quality. I figured that might hold true even with these inexpensive knives. Unfortunately, in this case, inexpensive truly was cheap. These knives are garbage. Rust started appearing almost immediately. The blades are stamped, not forged, and show imperfections out of the box. There are chips and bent areas near the point of the blade and the machining marks to make the ""everedge"" look very crude. I may be wrong, but I associate the low quality with these being manufactured in China rather than Germany. These no longer come out of the block and may soon simply go into the trash. I've gone back to my Cuisinart set of blades that is FAR superior in quality and craftsmanship. I'll keep my eyes open for genuinely quality knives made in Solingen."
2,They work OK... for a while,"I have had this knife set for almost 3 years, and have been mostly pleased with their performance. I don't like that they're all serrated, but in general they worked pretty well. Unfortunately, the tips are now all bent and the tip of the paring knife has completely broken off. Knives ought to last for more than 3 years. These are obviously poorly made. Your money would be better spent elsewhere."
3,sharp knives,"The knives are very sharp and the block for storing them is beautiful! I didn't realize they were all serrated so I'm trying to make my peace with that fact. Overall, I am satisfied and the price is very reasonable compared to alot of other sets."
2,Missing Information,I bought this knive set as a Christmas gift for my sister. When I got the knives it said on the box that they might not be suitable for left-handed people. She is left-handed and says they feel a little awkward. They are nice knives though for right-handed people.
4,Henkel kitchen block knives,The knives are light to handle and seem to be very sharp and easy to work with. I like the design and the look of the set. I hope they hold up for years to come.
5,wonderful and reasonably priced,"When I set up my wedding registry, I knew nothing about knives and registered for the least expensive set they had at the store. I realize now that knives are one of those things where you get what you pay for. Knowing that, I'm genuinely surprised by how low the price is for these knives. We bought this set last week and it is a huge improvement. It's not professional quality but it's more than enough for the average cook. The knives cut like a dream and the handles are very comfortable. I love the santoprene - it's very similar to the OXO tools that the rest of my kitchen is stocked with; in fact these handles are a perfect match with the OXO SteeL collection. The steak knives look fabulous with my flatware, too, which is always a plus. Two thumbs up."
3,Knives,I like the design of the knives. They just are not sharp. I have to push down real hard for them to cut anything.Shirley DeLarm
1,Very disappointing,"I was lusting after this set of knives for my kitchen for the longest time, but after getting them as a gift and using them for about a year have found them to be not very good at all. The grip handles are great, but the blades are strangely perforated and they have all rusted! It says they are made of stainless steel, so why are they rusting? I was shocked to see this low level of qaulity from a company like Henckles. I really don't recommend this product."
1,Chefs Knife Broke in Half on a Pepper,"I bought this set almost two years ago. It's true that the knives cut sort of ""funny"". Not a real clean cut. But the kicker is, I was chopping a red pepper for some chili, and the chef's knife snapped in half! It was not under much force, and in fact the knife was barely used. These are not good knives."
1,Looks great but rusts fast!,"On the first day of use, we managed to get rust spots on a couple of the knives. ON THE FIRST DAY! It was a wedding present so I couldn't return it. It was a huge disappointment because they really did look nice in the box.Oh and they cut fine."
1,Bad buy,These knives are garbage. Each knife is serrated so it cuts everything like a loaf a bread. I'm surprised Henckels puts it's name on this set. Spend a few more dollars and buy a respectable set.
1,Dangerous!,"This set is not only lacking the sharpness needed in cutting and dicing but it cointains nothing but serrated knives, why? That can be dangerous, I tell you from experience.I wanted to give them away to someone I know, but I don't think they deserve such a bad knife set. By the way, MADE IN CHINA."
4,Too good a deal to pass up...,"When my old wooden block finally fell apart and I saw my husband trying to glue and nail it together, I thought, ""enough already. What did we save our change for all those years?"" and I was so tired of having to sharpen all my old knives, over and over again. Costco wanted $150+ for these same knives. I love them. They are sturdy to hold in the hand, cut beautifully, clean easily and look great on the counter. The only thing I didn't consider was that I am left-handed and these knives are placed sideways in the block as a right-hander would place them. But I have a lifetime of experience in adjusting to the right-handed world. I consider this a very intelligent purchase."
2,Very pretty but no functionality,I have owned these knives for over a year and i love the way they look on my counter. However they dont cut very well at all...i find myself using kitchen shears that I purchased in the dollar store to be working much better. Great for decor but bad for the person who actually cooks in their kitchen.
3,Nice Knife set,"This is overall a nice set of knives, good weight and they don't bend too much. The price is the selling point here, Henckels International means ""made in China or Taiwan"" not Germany but overall it is a nice set. If you are the person who wants the German name this is not for you but if you want a knife that is sharp and ready to use every day, give them a try."
2,Not so great.,Rust spots starting appearing on the blades w/in the first month of use - not good. The knives work fine but who wants rust in their food?
1,Tips of knives bent and broke within a few weeks!,"I bought these knives for my wife's 40th birthday. I had heard great things about Henckels, and expected a decent set of knives, even though I understood it was not the top of their line.Still, I was surprised and dismayed when the tips of several knives bent after just a few weeks of normal use. When the tip of one steak knife broke and left a tiny metal fragment in the food I was preparing, I said enough and took the whole set back to the store for a refund."
1,Worst knives ever,"These are the worst knives I've ever owned. They don't cut well at all, and if you don't wash and dry them immediately after using them they will rust right away.Save yourself some time and frustration and use the money to buy a good chef's knife."
1,Doesn't cut straight and annoying serrated edge,"We bought this knife set as our first ""real"" cutlery set after we got married... To its credit, its lasted two years, but they haven't been great. The blades don't cut straight, they cut more like a blade thats only been sharpened on one side. The serrated edges make it impossible to sharpen them, and they chunk-up anything soft you try to cut. Essentially we've have to keep our old knives as a backup to these. The rusting is our own fault for putting them in the dishwasher, though they stand up surprisingly well to it. The money would have been better spent on a much better knife set that would last longer and be less aggravating."
1,The worst knives ever,I actually won this set at a work function and now after using them once I am giving them away. The box said that they are not recommended for left hand use. I am left handed but I even tried using my right hand just to see if it was different. No difference. They all cut like a dull serrated knife. All I can say is that they are awful PLEASE don't waste your money on these!!!
3,micro-serrated edges,I love the handles and the block is nice also but why Henckel decided to go with a full set of serrated knifes is beyond me. They tear softer meat and make refined cutting a chore. I didn't expect the world but when cutting raw chicken they shredded rather than slice.
2,"It's okay, but very convoluted","This book does a good job covering the details of the various protocols and standards used in different types of VPN's. But the same information can be pulled in nearly the same format from RFC's.After the first few chapters, the book get's confusing and is sometimes wrong when the author describes the process behind setup of a IPSEC VPN connection (there's a couple of places where AH is confused with ESP). Beyond that I found the book hard to follow because it lacks a broad comparison between different types of VPN's (why you would want to choose one type over another and so forth).But even more irking was paying [item price] for a book that's full of typo's and repetitive sentences."
1,Don't Twist!,"I knew when I bought this tool that the handle looked a little fragile for my needs, it flexes and distorts easily. Sure enough, after digging a few holes this spring, the handle broke off while twisting though some light surface roots. The design and features for the planter are wonderful, but it needs a steel handle."
1,Trash,"Don't twist is right! My unit's plastic handle cracked before I could make a dozen holes. Will seek a new planter that has a usable handle design. The rest of the unit is built of steel, but the flimsy handle makes the whole design worthy of the trash heap. Keep looking."
1,Get back to me when you make a metal version,"This is the great product. For the first three holes.Unfortunately, after three holes, the handle will snap and you'll be left with a $25 garage ornament. Had they built the handle from metal, this would be an amazing bulb tool. The way it is built, however, it's only a waste of money.If Hound Dog ever fixes the handle, though, it will be a great product."
1,Talentless to say the least.,"I have been listening such an amount of mediocre artists nowadays that is difficult to believe that music will be saved in the near future, but Joss Stone is the worst among the worsts. Absolutely talentless, I start to think how she got to record even one album, taking into consideration the inside photo of her with that black man I can imagine. Lets get rid of these mediocre artists and save American musical environment forever. Joss Stone go do anything else, music it is not your job. You should consider that inside photo with that black man and think better about your real profession and about your real talent that is clear now to everyone. I can imagine you singing hand in hand with madonna(the greatest mediocre ever, and beyonce, what a disaster, you are simply ridiculous, return to England and leave us alone, we deserve better things than you."
5,Smokin' introduction to UK soul singer and her producer,"Produced by Raphael Saddiq, a current darling of independent radio for his derivative and evocative 60's soul mash-ups. Joss can really sing soul and has a low-throaty range, like Alana Davis and many others. The 11 selections sound great in the car, since you'll need a three-way speaker to appreciate the ""wall o' sound"" arrangements...lots of horns and slammin' beats."
2,Stunningly insignificant,"Ms. Stone has had a makeover. Most of what made her distinctive has been removed, and she now fits in quite well with the mass of copycat female singers. Do we remember Aretha, Betty Wright, Billie Holiday, and Al Green because they made records that sounded pretty much like other artists of their day? She will get rich and this record will be forgotten."
1,Overrated / Don't believe the hype,"What a let down. I unfortunately purchased this CD and was thoroughly disappointed. This CD AND Joss Stone are totally overrated imo. Her previous album was a little better but this one was mediocore at best and nothing special about it. She has a nice voice enough voice I guess but it's just not very original and all the tracks just are blah to me and all sound the same. I ended up just giving the CD away, didn't want it taking up any of my space."
2,Joss Stone - latest cd I'm an idiot,It's just okay. Nothing remarkable -- I probably should not have purchased this and the Amy Winehouse CD at the same time. Amy blows Joss away on all levels!Okay -- I changed my mind. I don't know what I was thinking. I have fallen in love with this cd -- the songs are so passionate and moving. Her voice is insane. Sorry Amy all of your public foolishness has turned me off.
1,trying to find herself,"didn't like it. It seems like Joss is trying to find herself and has lost her way. Her first album is her best, so far."
2,Disappointed,"What a disappointment. I had been looking forward to receiving my copy of introducing Joss Stone for many weeks after making a pre-issue purchase.I couldn`t believe my ears from the moment the too high bass notes hit me on the 1st track. It was badly balanced. I think the sound engineer got it totally wrong here. The only track which was of listening quality was ` Tell me Bout it`. I am a great fan of Joss Stone, but I hope she doesnt release anything like this collection of downmarket numbers again. I will listen first before any purchases in the future. Let`s have a sultry collection of old Jazz classics Joss."
3,Very disenchanted,"The saddest part of this record is that if I didn't know Joss before, I would probably love it. The problem is that I expected so much more...soul out of her. I know she's young, but this album just feels like a desperate attempt to play with the cool kids. She always seemed like she had so much respect for the old legends, but now it just seems like she wants to hang out with sleazy producers and smoke who-knows-what.As a stand-alone piece, this album is okay. It has some catchy songs and Joss generally sounds pretty good, although I don't love her new-found habit of straining and screeching into her upper register. Still, I will listen to it occasionally and mostly enjoy the beats and her voice. I guess I just expected more."
2,it's aight,"alot of Hype has been bestowed upon Joss stone since her debut album&so far she hasn't met the marks that she was suppose to reach. Problem here is that there aren't any real songs that I'd call songwriting. Vocally she has some moments,but the material her is either trying to maintain the 60's vibe she has been tagged with or the so-so attempts at modernizing her to sound like today. either way it's a mix bag&isn't convincing."
3,We both see clearly now,"I love Joss Stone's voice. There's no denying it, the girl's got a set of pipes that are un-matched in this current generation of musicians, but I'm not sure Joss has found her groove yet.Admittedly, at 14 she was too young to make the important decisions to launch her career, but this girl's been through more changes than the weather.I think when she really hits her groove, folks will stop comparing her to Shelby Lynne, etc. It'll happen, but 19 may still be too young.You want to hear a great Brit chick with more heart and identity, you need to listen to ""Put your Records On"" by Corrine Bailey Rae. Corrine doesn't have Joss' voice, but she's got down who she is."
3,joss did you get it out of your system?,"I totally understand a young stars desire to appeal to her own age group AND to pilot her own ship so to speak.BUT how many great singers are great songwriters as well?Both the songwriting and producing are weak on this album. I also question the pairing of this great voice with modern hip-hop meets soul meets R&B; etc. Which always ends up in a hollow ""tribute"" to the great music being quoted.I am afraid if Joss keeps going like this I am sure she will sell lots of albums and end up leaving nothing for posterity apart from a terrific debut album that teased all with what could have been.here's hoping for a turn around.p.s. I forgot to mention that am not sorry I bought the album, it is better than the seoncd album IMHO and has some nice singing (though marred by poor arrangments and stylistic choices from the young producer) If you like Joss I think you should buy this, waiting may, in the end, be fruitless."
2,Musical Kleenex,"Joss Stone's a decent singer, but shouldn't be writing songs; or releasing them. I couldn't find a single memorable tune here. I also thought her singing was too flamboyant, but perhaps it's to keep up with the heavy production, which is so overcooked it's insufferable. Next time Joss should try losing the rappers and the big beat overkill. As one critic wrote, ""Sometimes it takes more balls to go it alone then with a whole crew."" I couldn't agree more. This album is like musical Kleenex, use it, then lose it. Better luck next time.On the other side of the coin, there's ""The Orange Album"" by Stefy (Rae) which is a stunning debut. Had Gwen Stefani made it, journalists would have called it a pop masterpiece. It's new artists like Stefy that could keep the music business afloat. Are we listening Ms. Stone."
1,A waste,"I'm very disappointed with this album. It's a waste of money, and worse, it's a waste of talent. Although Joss Stone performs with perfect vocals, the hip-hop/rap style does not suit her. Some tracks needlessly feature a male rapper who drowns out Joss's voice easily, especially since the mix is poor and the the bass is overblown.I'm sad to see Joss Stone at the top of the slippery slide which leads to becoming one of the mass of untalented rappers and bimbos that pervade the commercial market. I hope this album is only a temporary aberration, but given the allure of the easy bucks that come from catering to the lowest common denominator, I wonder.I'll think more than twice about buying her next album, and certainly would not recommend this one to anybody."
1,Shoulda Listened,"I should have listened to samples of this recording before I bought it! If I had, I would not have bought it since I do not like it at all."
5,The best!,"What can one say about ""the best""? She rocks! Where does one get that much soul at such a young age? Makes you want to get up and move!"
1,What Was She THINKING?,"I will never, ever buy another Joss album ever. I just knew her sound on the first two albums was going to be short lived and she would give into the pressure of being one of the ""normal"" R&B sounds that seems to be polluting the airwaves. I though this was gimmicky and I am truely a non-fan now. Waste your money on something else other than the insipid sounds of a washed-up wannabe singing to horribly put-together beats!"
4,Awesome soulful voice,"I saw Joss Stone on The Graham Norton Show and her beautiful soul-filled voice was captivating. My favorite songs are ""Tell Me 'Bout It"", ""Tell Me What We're Gonna Do Now"" and ""Put Your Hands On Me"", but they are all really good."
2,Not what I expected,I did not like the the first songs. It is not the Joss Stone I know and like.Clovis Jr.
3,THE GIRL GOT SKILLS,"EVEN THOUGH I GAVE THE CD A THREE.. HER VOICE AND UMPPPH CAN'T BE DENIED.THE CD IS WORTH PURCHASING THOUGH, I LIKE THE FACT THAT SHE COLLABORATED WITH EX TONI TONY TONE MEMBER, RAPHAEL SAADIQ.I LIKE HER DUO WITH LAURYN HILL TOO.WHY THE 3 THEN... JUST NOT ENOUGH OF A SOUL MIXTURE.... NEEDED MORE ..."
3,Okay,I really like Joss Stone. A true fan. This is a good record overall my only complaint is that most of the songs sound alike. I would have liked to see her come out of her zone alittle more. Mix it up alittle like on previous Records. She gets a solid B on this one!
5,Beautiful,"Great album. Heard her sing it live in Central Park (with Common) and it sounds even better in person. She is a beautiful songtress and has many strong lyrics, beats (thanks to Rafael Saadiq), and songs with other great artists (Lauryn Hill and Common). She even sounds better than many other black female singers whose music is already on the market. Joss can saaaaaaaaang!! It 'aint a color thing...it's a gifted thing. And she's only 19. She is doing big things at such a young age. God bless her soul, literally and figuratively!:) You won't be disappointed with this album."
2,Waiting for the next CD,"I loved her first record! The now classic songs,and her voice cut across generations. The production and playing felt timeless. With her writing the new songs on ""Introducing"" I couldn't wait to hear her voice with modern production. The problem is that I can't remember one of them. Now I can't wait to see what she does on her 4th CD. Artists have the right to change as they feel, and we have to right to enjoy or not enjoy their art. She is only 20 and has much to say."
2,Stone's song...not so pretty,"Caught Joss's first performance a few years back at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage fest...she then blew up like nitro on the U.S. scene....performing at all the major awards shows....hot like a stick of dynamite due to two great CD's coming out the gate. The sad thing is that perhaps she got a bit big for her britches.....she has a ways to go to be even remotely considered in the class of U.S. diva's in the soul world. Her sudden rise to fame, perhaps has gone to her head on the third CD....I understand it's her own work...and, well, not so good. I would simply recommend that she get the past producers and direction of the first two albums and go back to work. The potential for her is great, but she's going to have to work at it, or she temps the fates of being a flash in the pan kind of star."
5,Joss Stone,I am really enjoying this CD. Joss has a great voice! I will look for more of her music in the future!
1,"DON""T BELIEVE THE HYPE","I heard her first album and it was okay. Nothing to really shout about. I took a chance to buy her 2nd new album claming it was good. I played it once and never will play again. Her voice is drowned out by the mixed up garbage they call music playing in the background. I think she has a voice but she needs new songwriters and producers. I can see why she's really not that popular with the american audience. Amy Winehouse album is more enjoyeable to listen to than this R&B crap. At least she writes her own songs. Do yourself a favor and buy Amy Winehouse instead of this annoying album. This and barbie doll, plastic, mask heavy make-up wearing beyonce are the worst clowns I have ever heard."
2,Not the Stone I was looking for,I am sorry and this was not the Joss Stone I wanted to get to know. But as a fan...I sent the money anyway. But if you are not a fan...dont make the same mistakes I did.
1,I'm throwing the CD away,"I bought this CD because a friend turned me on to some older Joss Stone. It was great! However, this CD was a waist of $$. I hate it so much, I'm getting ready to throw it out right now!"
1,Nowhere Safe to Rest Your Eyes,"Not since Norah Jones has someone been so overrated, and as the previous commentator said it better than I, mind bogglingly pretentious. And at least Norah Jones was pleasant, in a kind of young sort of sesame street kiddie appeal, and Jones is cute and has a sort of harmonious prettiness. Stone however already seems to have a Joplin sort of mannish hideousness and middle aged spread going for her. To paraphrase Cracker: the world needs another overrated tired white girl pretending to be black and around the block a few times a la Aretha Franklin, like I need a whole in my head!Go away Joss Stone-at least just torture your own country men and women!"
2,"very disappointed, overproduced, where are the real drums and instruments","way way way overproduced, with protools and all this modern technology crapif she were smart she would have been using well established producers that know how to incorporate some of the modern engineering/producing into her craft rather than utilizing protools with no real instruments on most tracksit is a travesty to her talent ......very disappointedthe total opposite when you see her live, she has one of the most competent rhythm sections on the planetbetter luck next time!!!"
4,"Different, but good","Initially I was a little iffy about buying this CD upon reading some of its reviews. I realize this CD was not as well-recieved by fans of the old album, but I thought it was very enjoyable. I find myself putting this CD on quite frequently and listening to the entire thing (which is a big thing for me, I often skip around). It is very different from her last CD, but really, it is just as good. If you are not going to be upset that it is not an extention of her previous album, I say give it a chance."
3,"Good, not great","I too am a little disappointed in the hip-hop riffs that permeate this CD, but let's be practical: Giving this CD a 1 or 2 star is just stupid and mean! Joss's voice is still solid as a rock, and there are more than enough songs where her voice is ""not"" drowned out by backup singers. It's a solid 3-4 star easily. I only give it a middle score because I definitely don't like the Def Poetry licks in a couple of the tunes. That didn't grab me at all, and was distracting.But Stone is still one of the best voices out there. This one is worth your cash."
4,Jossing Around,"I think this is the 5th review I have written today, so I guess you will have to deal with the silly puns. What you don't have to deal with is some lame R&B; album. Joss Stone is squarely on the map with this effort. Buy this thing baby!She has a rich voice and knows how to turn a phrase. Her style is not indicative of Joss turning 20 this year. If she is this good now, I can't wait to see what she has produced over a 20 or more year career.Get this one because it she has a lot to offer, and this I think is only the beginning.Kevin"
2,Gave CD to my daughter,"The CD was not what I expected from the snipets of songs that I listened to on-line. I thought it would be more jazz/blues, but it is definitly more rap/hip hop. There was one song on the CD that I liked. I passed it on to my teenage daugher, and she liked it."
2,not as good as the last one,I loved Joss' last album. I was very excited for this one. It just wasn't as good.
2,This is not Joss Stone,"I was so excited to see that Joss Stone was releasing a second cd of original songs. This cd wasn't worth the weight. Three of the songs due sound like the blusey and jazzy Joss Stone I first fell in love with. Three more are just to Britney Spears (to much POP; Doesn't due her voice justice). The rest of the songs are just bad techno. This cd is diffently not worth the $20 price. Due yourself a favor and just say NO. And what is with Track 1 and 14, its just people talking?"
2,Terrible CD,The Joss Stone of Snakes and Ladders is MIA. On this release she appears to be a background singer for a second rate rap group. There is NONE of the magic of her voice and lyrics from the Body and Soul CD.
2,"Whole lot of sound, not much substance","I liked Joss Stone's first CD, but I can't even stand to listen to this one. It is so over done, it's obnoxious. The songs are just okay. I like R&B (love beyonce), but the production is so busy, I honestly can not listen to a song the whole way through. It's like the production is working again the song."
2,Is She Trying To Be Non-Original?,I loved the first Joss Stone cd's because they were more distinct from so much other music out there. Now Joss Stone is going through some wierd phase where she has to sound like everything on the radio and look like every other hoochie out there. I like the bear-footed Joss better. Too desparate to be mainstream.
3,My girl Joss...,"Ever since i heard ""You Had Me"" I've been a Joss Stone fan. As soon as I heard the song i went straight to the store to buy her cd, problem was I didnt know off what album the song came from so I bought Soul Sessions by mistake. One thing about Joss Stone is she has that one song on each album that stands out more than any song on the whole album. On Soul Session it was ""The Chokin Kind"" on Mind, Body, & Soul there was a couple but my favorite was ""Spoiled"". On Introducing...Joss Stone it was ""What Were We Thinking"". But on Color Me Free I'm finding it hard to find that stand out song. I read the other reviews and listen to there opinion and I dont hear it. Governmentalist with Nas is cool but I dont think this CD is better than Mind,Body,& Soul, but its a quality cd."
3,Fun but ephemeral,"Won't hold up as well as her first two classic-sounding albums. I love her voice, but this album is very crunchy-sounding and repetitive. I'll be tired of it by Easter, I think, and will return to ""Mind Body & Soul"" -- its ""Doncha Wanna Ride"" is so much more appealing than the noisy, overproduced ""Headturner."" This CD is a lot of fun and great for the gym, but it's probably going into the CD library to be forgotten and rediscovered in a year or so. Still, it's a far cry better than most of the crap out there on the pop muzik shelves! At least she knows what good soul music is supposed to sound like, unlike her ""Idol""-ized contemporaries."
3,Bruised but not Broken,One of y boyfriends favorite songs is on this CD which is what got me to purchuse this CD. After receiving it I found it to have a lot of good songs. This is one that I enjoy.
2,Change isn't always good,"I liked Joss Stone's first two albums but really hated this one. It was like the producers wanted to throw every rap and funk effect possible into the mix. Her voice still sounds great, but the material was very weak. This one sounded way too much like a rap release for my tastes."
4,Great voice,"Definitely a great voice, I love almost all the songs of this album, especially ""Tell me 'bout it"" and ""Tell Me What We Are Gonna Do Now"". She has a really soulful voice, you should buy her CD!"
4,"First, but not the last!","This is my first Joss stone album, but I0m sure it won't be the last.Excellent music, warm voice, the right rithm to dance all the night.Thanks Joss"
2,Joss needs no Introduction,"Joss Stone has the pipes to sing, she definitely does not need to change as the 'LAME' intro to this CD states. Joss has a voice you never get tired of listening to. The 'RAP' on this CD by 'whoever' is a disappointment and a waste of time and takes away form the real talent of Joss.It gives me the idea that whoever that person is may be trying to ride in on Joss's coat tail, taking advantage of her talent. She really lowered her standards to allow the intro & rap to be included. If you are a true Joss fan, you may want to save your money."
5,She is now my FAV,"Got to be the most inspiring voices, she has so much soul in her songs. Bet her concerts would have U rating her your best too"
4,GREAT,"Joss Stone is back with a new album this year. When i first found that out I was scared. Sure she has an amazing voice. But her last CD was so boring. She speeds it up a lot on this one with a great collection. Neo 60's soul with some pop fushion. Great CD.The key tracks are: Put Your Hands One Me, Tell Me Bout' It, Girl They Won't Believe It."
2,not just bad but sad.,"I knew I was in trouble when the first cut started and instead of Joss I get some guy telling me about how you need balls to change. I didn't buy the cd to hear guys talking but to hear joss singing. I have listened and liked joss from her first cd and her live performances are transcendent. I checked all the reviews and there's a love it or hate it feel to them. Joss is a talented young woman and if this is her sound all I can say is good luck girl and catch you later. One thing thought I will say is that on this cd she loses her freshness. There's nothing here that stands out, no cut that I want to play over and over. There's a sameness to it like a million other young wanna be's. When a women has got the pipes and Joss has got them the trick is less is better.You don't need the backup singers, the guys rapping and the heavy back beat all you need is Joss. Some time it takes more balls to go it alone then with a whole crew."
4,"More Joss, less production","As always, Joss' vocal talents do not dissapoint. The problem with this CD (and what keeps it from getting 5 stars) is the over-production and the spoken-word filler, whether it's the intro (I understand the point trying to be made, but why not just make it with the music?), or the hip/hop interjected into the middle of a song (I buy Joss Stone CD's to hear her marvelous instrument, not to hear rhymes.)Great singers don't need over-production. You need to be able to hear the voice, not the thump of the bass. That being said, I am still enjoying this CD. I just hope that Joss' next work is with a producer who understands the concept of restraint."
3,"I love Joss, but really hate to say...I don't know if I like this one as much!","Maybe the album just needs to grow on me a little, but the first two albums are still in my everyday playlist, I love them! Most of her previous songs are soulful jams! There are only a couple good songs on this newest release that I would say are the Joss sound that I came to love...Can't all be winners I guess, but I will still buy a 4th album when it's released!Keep working Joss! Your still awesome! A true talent!"
2,Nothing clicked.,"Except for brief appearances by Carol Lynley, it was a bore from first to last minute.Actors didn't seem to interact. Nothing could be taken seriously but neither could anything be taken lightly.I watched it through to the end only because I like Ms. Lynley unconditionally.Lynley's short closing speech was authentic, but so much so that it should have been in another movie. Likewise, Palance burned with inner intensity. All, however, to little effect.Nothing clicked."
1,Bang! Bang! Don't bother!,"Steely Palance and luscious Lynley are wasted in this shoot 'em up ""spoof"" of gangster flicks."
2,Came without jacket cover,"This was purchased to be a gift. The product description indicated the book was new, however, it came without the jacket cover which shows the name of the book and the author. What arrived was only the bare book - with no jacket and with what looks like wear marks on the front and back of the book. As I stated, I wanted to give it as a gift to someone in Texas. I can find no way to contact the seller to inquire about exchanging it for another book WITH the cover. I think that if this switch was intended, it is fraudulent advertising since the description picture showed the book with the jacket and the words ""The Face of Texas Michael O'Brien"" across the front. I hope there is some way to contact the seller to rectify this."
2,Poor quality video,"I won't say anything about the show itself... if you like Elton, you'll love the show... but quality of video is slightly better than VHS... surprisingly, quality of bonus material (which includes fragments from EXACTLY THE SAME SHOW) is much better than that of the main feature.First AC/DC ""No Bull"", now Elton John ""The Red Piano""... this is a rip-off... save your money, this definitely is not a hi-def video you would expect on a blue-ray disc."
2,A dissapointment in the quality of the disc.,"Like two commentators above I too find the quality of the concert to be of VHS standards. The documenatry is very clear but the main reason for buying this Blue ray is the concert which is not a good blue ray standard.I have the red piano in concert in Las vegas and it is very much as seen live. Don't pay the extra bucks for the blue ray, the standard dvd wil be just as good."
3,"Documentary+ 2 CD's 5 Stars, Concert 2 Stars","First off, I think the producers of the actual concert footage must have wanted it to be soft and grainy to give it more of a film look, because the same footage in the documentary was crystal clear! Only things is, on a blu-ray disc it comes across horrible. Buy this for the 2 cd's, which sounded great, and the documentary."
4,"This night is yours, Elton John!","But the stage is not! I love this Blu-ray production, Elton John and his music. Unfortunately, this stage is still Celine Dion's. The stage design is OK, nonetheless, the biggest drawback is no large stage dance like Celine Dion's ""A New Day"". I give four-star rating for everything in five but dance. The recording, the band, the performance, the directing, the editing, all are artistic and professional in their highest standard. Just, it could be ""better"" with large stage dance. I saw the show in Vegas. Comparing to it, the Blu-ray is a great deal, a must buy to your collection."
4,It's Elton John,I was looking for a few extra's for my husbands Christmas present. He is a EJ fan from the 70's so I thought I would try. I wasn't sure since the price was so cheap. This was perfect. This is the same as the set that is selling for 25 dollars elsewhere. Is a great addition to his collection.
5,love it.,I personally saw Elton's Red Piano from the front row in Vegas at least six times & the DVD is almost as Exciting. David LaChapelle vision is pure ART & Elton Delivers !
1,Looks like a copy DVD! (Blu ray???!!!!!!),I really like and love Elton and the show is really really great but...Why looks so bad??? If i buy a blu ray is because of the HD 1080 image.This blu ray just look awful
2,"Video Quality is Poor, Too much talk and too little music.","Since this is a blu-ray disk I expected it to be high def. It is not. On a 1080P TV the video quality is poor. Additionally, I would have like to have had more songs and less chatting by Elton."
2,POOR QUALITY - video production appalling...,"Received this blu-ray as a gift and couldn't wait to get it on. This is another one of those blu-ray discs that simply isn't blu-ray quality. Unfortunately, the other blu-ray title gifted to me was an Oasis Concert, the video quality of which, once again is appalling.I did wonder if there's something wrong with my blu-ray player (Panasonic BD80) but a google search reveals quite a view similar comments about the poor video quailty of these discs.I'm not saying 'Don't Buy' (well certainly not the Oasis disc, which is watchable though not brilliant) but be aware you're not getting the video quality you should expect from a blu-ray format.Attention to detail is one of the things I always associate with EJ and therefore, whilst not actually being a gambler (so to speak) I would be prepared to wage a small bet he has no idea how bad this blu-ray disc is."
2,Best that the ladies stay away from short stories.,I was disappointed with this one. The other full length novels are wonderful and suspenseful and one can visualize living in Tahoe or Carmel.
3,Mystery collection scores a few times,"This is a collection of short stories by two sisters who write together under the pseudonym of Perri O'Shaughnessy. Some of these stories were previously published (mostly in Ellery Queen) and some on a web site called[...]. My observation is this, most of the stories which were not published anywhere, were either rejected, or known to be of lesser quality and thus not submitted. I have to say that almost every story which was published in an actual journal was well written and enjoyable, but the others, were generally not up to snuff. I make exception for the final short story ""A Grandmother's Tale"" which was charming and brief, and I think would have been accepted at a publication which would publish a story that short."
1,Sadly disappointed,"I love reading the stories of Nina Reilly so when I seen that there was a new book I just had to read it. I have read every book they have written and I have never been disappointed before. But this time I was sadly disapointed. Many of the stories were weird and left me saying ""huh"" at the end because I was so confussed. There were many of the stories that I had to make myself finish, just because I like to finish one when I start it. Typically I can't put one of their books down until i'm done. If they ever put out another book of short stories I don't know if I would read it after this book."
1,sent wrong order,I ordered Lifetime calcium supplent and was sent this stuff instead. Ugh!Didn't even finish the first bottle.....all in the trash!
1,the curse causeless shall not come,"not for today. information is out of date. went to one of the doctors meetings in longmont colorado back in the 70's and it was very interesting. we followed his instructions and it seemed to be working but we had to move and there wasnt any doctors in that area that supported his system, so it went by the wayside. we found out later that the doctor was arrested and blackballed by the AMA. sad!"
1,Not worth even 1 star....,"Bought this pack of Belkin replacements, one of them was broken from a get go, as soon as I opened the package and it fell out on a carpet, the tip broke off. In other words, the other three lasted about a month, so look for some other maker or no name brand do not buy Belkin. Really poor quality, and bad product, cheap plastik head screws into a metal cylinder and creates a stress point at the place where it screwed in, constantly falling out."
4,"Flashman once again ""dancing truth's gossamer tightrope""","-Flashman and the Dragon- is set in China during the Taiping Rebellion of 1860. As with other Flashman stories, there is much historical truth, liberally peppered with Fraser's witicisms and Flash's typcial bawdy and cowardly behaviour. The story line draged a bit about 2/3 of the way through (I thought the diversion from the march to Peiking was a bit overdone), but true to form, Flashman finishes strong. A very fun read."
1,Sent Mine Back,"I wanted a PCO air purifier to have in my office, but this was too rinkydink for my tastes. I has four light-emitting diodes, one in each corner. I've seen small PCO filters that were made for use in a car that used LEDS, but for the space this fan takes up, I think it is way under lit. It seemed to add more odor to the room from its own off-gassing than it cleared up. I ran it for about two hours. It was very quiet on low speed at first, but then it started making a scraping/bearing noise. I sent it back and will try the NanoBreeze next. I don't have anything against Sunpentown. I have a humidifier and a portable air conditioner from them that I am very happy with. The PCO fan was unacceptable."
2,Expensive fan,"I like the design of this product. It is able to swivel from side to side and tilt up and down. It also runs pretty quiet even on high. It comes with an extra long cord. That is about as much positive as I can say about it. I was hoping to clear out some of the musty mildew smell I was greeted with upon moving to my new place. It has made no noticeable difference in the air quality of my apartment. I purchased one for a friend with my order, and he didn't pick his up for a few weeks. So I was running two of these units side by side for a while and still noticed no improvement in air quality. He placed his in a room with a litter box and it seemed to spread the odor around instead of eliminating it. The LED's used to light the grid are very dim. It seems to me that the photo oxidation and ion production is very minimal."
3,Special Assignment: Baby,"It's been awhile since I've read a Harlequin romance novel. I can see that not much has changed over the years! It's ironic that no matter what author's name is on the front cover, the story is pretty predictable.I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy this book. It had a decent story line. Court is responsible for bringing down this Neely guy who is determined to take down everyone in the city. Court's job is to play the part of good militia soldier while in truth he's an undercover agent.Sabrina (Brin) is busy doing everything she can to keep the family ranch afloat while keeping an eye of her teenage brother who is quickly forming alliances with Neely. Why can't he see he's not a good guy to be around?Court sees Brin again...it's been so long. Does she still love him? He her? Can Court give up everything he loves for Brin...and their child?"
3,pain in my ear.,"Where's the guitars'?.I guess if your into aor,then this is cool.But iflike aor,or melodic rock check out Korea,now that's some good rock w/hooks and great tempos'to go with it."
2,Flat album with few Cuberisms.,"As a life long Ronnie Cuber fan i was quite disapointed with this album. This album felt dated and unoriginal. If you are familiar with Ronnie Cuber from his work with Gad Gang then this album will likely feel uninspired. It's a blend of smooth jazz, thanks to the collaboration with George Benson, and pop jazz. The feel is decidedly elevator or dental office like with little to really grab the listener. On the upside Cuber brings his amazing improvisational skills to attempt to liven up the otherwise tame jazz surroundings. If you buy this album try not to spend much for it."
1,Not even close to history just plain fiction!,"Stenger believes Hill is guilty from the start and tries to make him out to be a common criminal. While Joe is no choir boy the truth is stranger than fiction. Little is known of Hill's buddy Otto Applequist, but over the years more facts have been uncovered about this man's fascinating life. Not the ... son of a Swedish minister but one of many sons of a working class family. An immigrant who becomes disillusioned with the American dream after he finds, instead of streets paved with gold, only forests, mines, docks, and streets covered with the blood of his fellow workers. Not a romantic bandit, but a revolutionary who chose to use his death sentence to bring the cause of labor to the forefront. If you want a balanced book about him get Joe Hill by Gibbs Smith. ""Don't Mourn - Organize!"" - Joe Hill 1917"
5,Good read...,"Really good book about one drug dealer in NYC when crack hit with its devastating impact and deadly consequences. Like most books on this topic, deals with the rise and ultimate fall of a drug dealer. Author gives great descriptions and you'll be able to imagine the locations as if you've been there before."
3,Rock Solid,"Oh my! This one was hard to read because I've met one of the players in this book so I suppose you can say I got both sides. This book kept my attention for sure but I wonder if a few things were changed to make a gruesome person worse. I think one should not present as fact everything unless there is proof to that fact. I heard about one incident in that book and word on the street is the main character was given credit for one murder he didn't have anything to do with because it was a grave accident and the guilty one was afraid to come forward. Now, the rest was owned and I tell you the person in that book is scary. I only hope he never returns to that path. This book was well written but I think I found a typo or two. I love reading and finding them. All jokes aside I enjoyed reading and being scared by this book. :-)"
2,Problem with ambient light sensitivity and ...,"I bought 3 of these night lights on May 06. One of them has already burned out (Oct 07).A problem common to each light was that they remained on most of the time, even in situations where the ambient light was of sufficent level to read a newspaper. It would take direct light from lamp or sunlight to turn the nightlights off.The only good quality was low power consumption."
4,A Great LED Night Light with Very Low Power Consumption,"Pros:- LED consumes very little power. You will love it if you think green.- LED lasts a long time. Good for 100,000 hours- You can direct the light aiming by rotating the top- Light sensor turns off the LED during the day- Not burning hot to touch as compared to incandescent bulbs- PriceCons:- May not be enough light for your liking- Light is bluish white"
5,Convenient and energy efficient night light,"Despite the unusual appearance, this is very convenient and works well. My kids love theirs."
3,Little too bright for bedroom,"These lights work well for a hall or bathroombecause they put out a fair amount of light. Butfor my bedroom I thought it was too bright, I endedup preferring one of those old fashioned florescentgreen lights that have a much softer glow."
1,Consider Alternatives!!!!,I bought `FIVE' of these night lights for our house. I ended up throwing away all of them since their brightness faded away with time. Consider alternatives before you spend money on these useless lights.
2,Mediocore light,"I had high hopes for this nightlight after reading other reviews, but it isn't so hot. The light isn't very bright and quite diffused, and the light sensor isn't sensitive enough - it stays on in all but the brightest light. I ordered two, but have only opened one, and the other is likely to stay in its packaging."
3,The picture doesn't show everything,"I bought some of these, and I like them except for one thing: there's a grating on the side not pictured, opposite the window. I suppose this might be for ventilation (but I wouldn't expect these to get hot), but it also means that if you're looking down when you walk past, you can see the LED bulb directly through the grating, and it's somewhat blinding."
1,"Bring your pillow, this one will put you to sleep","I bought this video for use as an introduction to Medieval/Renaissance instrumentation and style in my middle school general music classroom. At the time I thought that the period costumes would be excellent for discussing style trends during this time period. However, upon recieving the (highly priced) DVD I watched and imediately regretted my purchase. The video is filmed live in what appears to be a school cafeteria for 4-5th graders. The characters banter is of period speech, but highly geared toward younger students. Also the DVD was just simply slow and quite boring. Needless to say I did not subject my students to this video."
1,Flimsy and overpriced,This is too flimsy for most adults. I'll probably give it to my young daughter. Recommend at least a 2mm chain. Bottom line: This is way overpriced.
2,I read 125 pages and cannot remember a single fact.,"Having a fascination with 20th Century European history in general and World War II in particular, I was looking forward to learning about the French experience under Occupation. This book, however, is a tedious and ponderous journey through the author's own meandering thoughts. I read 125 pages and cannot recall any clear facts; everything the author writes is airy and speculative. Granted he writes well and has a masterful understanding of French politics, people and culture during this period. But for anyone looking to understand the colorful forces and figures which contributed to both French Occupation and subsequent Resistance, this is not the book for you. This book might be better suited for a Doctoral student or a French historian...but not for the average student of History."
5,Julie Andrews in concert,"This is a must for the Julie Andrews fan. Watching Julie in concert, singing some of her most favorite songs, is truly 60 minutes of true entertainment. Julie really gives it her all in this concert. She talks to the audience a bit about her upbringing and experience in the English music halls at the end of that era. She is very warm and humble in her presentation. Her choice of songs is delectable and her singing is pure and clear as a silver bell.Now that this wonderful voice can no longer sing in the manner we have all admired, a true Julie fan better scoop this up while they can. We will not hear Julie sing like this ever again- sadly so."
2,Find a proper history instead,"Perhaps it's a case of, ""It's the sort of thing you'll like, if you like that sort of thing"", but I can't say that I liked this one. The author presents a very-nearly-interesting concept, that Custer survived the Little Bighorn fight, only to be court-martialed for his failures. However, he presents it in third-person, present tense; an unusual choice in modern literature. Also, the narrator offers the inner thoughts of a different character each chapter. The result is a style that I found tedious and forced. As to plot elements outside the realm of what one might read in a history, they appear to have been left out. Although one of the characters refers to the case as ""having more intrigues than the Arabian navy"", I suspect that I've known houseplants with more interesting lives. Finally, lacking any notes from the author, I'm left not knowing what was fiction and what was not. In the end, I wish that I'd read a proper history of the incident instead."
4,Interesting Storyline,"Written in the not so serious style of the Avengers world. As long as you don't analyze the science behind the story, it makes for a good read, especially if you grew up watching Avengers repeats as I did. If the movie stays true to the story, it should do ok!"
4,En bok du inte vill lägga ifrn dig,"Välskriven och spännande deckare, med en delvis okonventionell intrig. Den som läst de tidigare böckerna om Wallander kan dock finna vissa upprepningar, som blir trkiga i längden och som tar ner betyget en aning."
2,"Some nice features, but not worth the money.","It's hard to justify the cost for the set of features it delivers. I've waited a long time for this upgrade from Microsoft; I expected more. If the price where more like a Windows Me upgrade,... I'd say it's worth the money, but over twice as much for the standard edition upgrade, I'd say wait as long as you can to upgrade.Perhaps Microsoft will realize it needs to add more funcationality or start offering large rebates. As much as Microsoft needs the revenue from Office, if it doesn't sell as expected, Microsoft will need to do something."
3,Some new things but....,"Ok first i don't know what some people were talking about ms instant messenger (which has nothin to do with the office suite) but office xp provides some new capablities for the power user. For the occasional user that checks their e-mail with outlook, writes a few word documents and maybe a powerpoint presentation DONOT need this upgrade. The new features are very small and you probably won't even know what they are. Basically all the aplications were left untouched but i have actually noticed a little faster start-up time. It does contain a pretty good document imaging utility to scan text documents and edit them in word and a feature to import and export your office settings which i thin kyou can get as an add-on for office 2000"
1,XP ruined the Microsoft products on my Dell computer,"I installed this product on my Dell computer. It did not try to register itself, but I got the message that installation was complete. I cannot access Word, Excel or PowerPoint. I was not able to uninstall it completely. Windows 98 and Explorer are hardly working. I cannot access my Office 97 or even uninstall it and reinstall. Dell Computer is of absolutely no help.Office XP is dangerous garbage."
2,DISAPPOINTING AND TIRED WHICH WELL ERM...SUXX!,"This one contains non of the charm or fun of 'Stakk Attakk' having appeared some years later after lengthy legal battles with Heavy Metal Records. Couple of okay dittys in 'Nukklear Rokket' and the title track but everything else is characterless and missing a real hook or tune. Overall I think 'Wrathchild' were moving a way from their Great British-ness and attempting to compete with the likes of Poison in the US way of thinking, therefore its not always convincing or very good. 'Hooked' is a little painful to endure with an attempt at Vince Neil cry-baby vocals that get quite animated by the end of the track (but not in a good way), 'OK-UK' has a 'Rockin in the USA ' by KISS blue-print stamped all over it lyrically but fails to take off in any real way, and most of the others are just okay I guess. Now what would be nice would be a CD compilation of the 'Stakkheel Strutt' and 'Do Ya Want My Love' 12"" eps that would be great!"
1,this laptop battery cannot hold charge,Bought this battery at the beginning of the year. Battery will not hold it's charge over night after 1 month. Waste of money.
1,DOA,I dont blame the seller but this battery did not even register as present in the computer. I went with a slightly more expensive batt from another seller.
5,Very happy,Product was as described ( except capacity slightly larger - an added bonus). Works perfectly. Very happy with the product.
4,Voltio strikes again,"The general consensus among music critics concerning ""A Punto de Estrallar"" is that their previous album, ""I Love Salsa,"" was much more exciting and distinctive, with this album failing to bring anything new to the table. I have to agree. There are a few exciting songs that are enjoyable to listen and dance to, while the rest are quickly forgotten and seldom played. My favorite by far is ""Ella Volvio"" with Voltio. As with ""Amor De Una Noche"" in the last CD, Voltio brings something special to this salsa. ""Zoom Zoom"" is also an enjoyable track. If these two songs had been available on iTunes, I would not have bought the CD. The majority of the songs are predictable and fail to stand out, but a couple of the songs have proved to be definite keepers in my salsa collection."
3,Apunto de Estrallar is Right,"Apunto de Estrallar is right. They are almost ready to explode, but not quite. The music sounds OK. The musicians, specifically, their lead trumpet player sounds great. I truly enjoyed their I Love Salsa CD, but this CD does not have the same energy with the vocals or arrangements as their previous ones. ""Ella Volvio"" is probably the only song/track that stands out in this CD. This CD fizzled out for me after the 5th track."
1,"This is a serial cable, not a usb cable!","The cable came in good shape, in a new box. However, I didn't read the fine print about the cable using a serial port instead of the (now standard) usb port. If you have an old computer (which is likely, using an old palm), this is fine, since you should have a serial port on your computer. My laptop, however, does not, rendering this product worthless to me. I got it for pretty cheap, so I figured I didn't care enough to send it back (since it was my mistake, after all). Just thought everyone should know this..."
4,Creating the Protestants,"Osborne, the popular enfant terrible of British drama in the 1950's and 60's (then ignored once his politics became unfashionable in artistic circles) won several awards for this play, an interesting but hardly comprehensive portrait of Martin Luther's career. The title role (originally played by Albret Finney)is challenging for an actor, and intriguing for the reader. The second act--in which Luther fights the Catholic Church--is strong and well-written; the first is also dramatic in its attempt to explain why Luther did what he did; the third, however, by viewing Luther at the end of his life, disappoints because we are only TOLD about his accomplishments rather than sharing them.The scope of the play is too large--it tries to cover too much time rather than concentrating on one (or a few) specific events. But it is a curious and fascinating play; few are written about religion any more, and for that alone it is engrossing."
3,1970's NYC Fashion Scene meets Horror,"I viewed this movie for the first time this past weekend.What's GREAT about this movie - NYC, 1970's fashion scene, great fashion shoot premise based on crime scenes, Faye Dunaway, Tommy Lee Jones, Model Lisa Taylor.What's BAD about this movie - The horror/slasher parts, the storyline was weak and highly predictable. Although possibly if I had watched this movie when it was originally released, it may not have seemed so predictable.If you love fashion, if you love seeing Manhattan from various time periods then I definitely recommend this DVD.If you are into horror flicks and are looking to watch this movie because of that, I don't recommend the movie."
5,Still Crazy after all these years.,"I first saw this film when it came out in the 70's. I have seen it many times and still enjoy it. Tommy Lee Jones is great and has lived up to his early promise. Faye Dunaway is in top form. It is a model of a scary and intelligent movie. The disco, interestingly, also holds up and adds to the flavor."
5,"Great, ITEM","Male customer/This product was well received in my kitchen/All these years ,without a Cleaver!!,Great quality product,handle could be a touch bigger."
4,Satisfied,"A very comfy fit and weight in the hand, not too heavy, and a very sharp blade. I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because I received it with a dent on the very tip of the chopper blade. Instead of paying the S&H to return it, I had my husband use his sander to even out the edge. Overall a good product."
2,The rust monster,"I am not a fan of rust on my kitchen cutlery. I got this cleaver because of some high reviews on Amazon, but have found that I truly got what I paid for: a cheap functional cleaver that, while usable, is a pain to upkeep and was constructed with low-grade materials.My wife uses it for opening coconuts, and it servers that purpose well. I want to toss it in the garbage can.If you do decide to get one of these, make sure you keep its exposure to liquids to a bare minimum - and get some rust remover."
3,Buena pero muy corta.,"Para ser una edición tan corta de la telenovela al principio estaba muy lenta. Después fue mejorando, se intentó mostrar casi todo pero como no es tan largo el resumen la historia se muestra muy rápidamente dejando huecos en la trama. Aún así me entretuvo."
4,Nina Amada Mia,"This was one of the first Telenovelas I watched on TV. I absolutely loved this story and the actors. And, yes they did an unjustice by abridging it to much, but this was release fairly early when compared to some of the other novelas. Most of the new telenovela DVDs are running about 700-800 minutes (or 10% of the actual TV run time). I purchased this more as a souvenir and I have watched it a couple of times. The theme song is by Alejandro Fernandez, and it is wonderful as I have that on a video DVD as well. I also, love Karyme Lucía Lozano and I have everything that she made. She was in her early 20s in this telenovela. I also love Sergio Goyri---what you can say! He's the typical Latin men role. Very macho! Love him!"
4,"Yet another RUSH, but still great as ever","I didn't really need another RUSH concert dvd, as there are plenty to go around, but since we are RUSH fans, we must have it right?Well, as expected, it is great as usual (except there is no sound unless you have your player on 2.0 stereo for some reason).I was pleased to hear the whole Moving Pictures, Witchhunt & Camera Eye sounded great. Presto & Time Stand Still were also nice to hear. They played enough odd songs to make you happy.Otherwise, it is mostly the usual stuff you already have on the other concert DVDs.But again, we are RUSH fans and love it nonetheless."
4,RUSH LIVE,Just a great concert sound quality was excellent......Had not seen them live since 1981. There is a reason why a band like this stays around for 2 generations to enjoy.
5,5 stars for sound and vid....3 for song selection,"From a technical, engineered, sound and video standpoint they finally got one right. This is by far the best sounding live recording they have ever done. DTS 5.1 Master is AWESOME! There's actually some low end to this one....yeah! Blu-ray vid through Oppo 93 and 60"" plasma looks excellent. Very ...very good quality.My only complaint is that the song selection sucks! Coming from 40+ shows going back to Hemispheres I'm sick and tired of everything on MP but Camera Eye. Come on guys. Get rid of every ""hit"" and give us a B sides live. Please!It rocks, it's Rush. If you have a good blu ray player and sound system....buy it."
2,Fair Video Quality + Geddy's Failing Voice,"I'll keep this brief since most other reviewers have touched on every aspect of what I am going to say. It's time that bands realize that if they are recording a concert intended to be released on Blu Ray, they NEED to have the audio mixed well and the video quality needs to be top-notch - is there really an excuse for that not to happen? There is no excuse for anything less, especially if we, the fans, are expected to pay Blu Ray prices.As for the performance, it is painfully obvious that Geddy is incapable of hitting those high notes anymore. Sometimes I would cringe because his voice was so strained and pitch was so off. I was perfectly happy with the musicianship of all the guys, but Geddy's (lack of) voice made this Blu Ray a 1-time-watcher for me."
4,Is it just me?,"I've seen Rush many times over the years and they have never disappointed. This video is no exception.Probably my favorite setlist of all time. Throw in Xanadu and The R30 overture and I'd be in heaven. I'm being greedy. The only problem I'm having with this DVD, and maybe it's just me. I can't get the audio to play if I select 5.1 in setup.It will only play in dolby 2.0. Any other Rush DVD I have will play in 5.1 if chosen on any DVD player in the house. Took my 1st copy back to Best Buy and got another with the same results. Any help or comments would be appreciated."
3,A Little Disapointed,"I own all Rush DVDs.: RIO, R30,Rush3X,Snakes & Arrows and now Time Machine.I am frankly a little disapointed. I am 47 years old, I have been listening to Rush since I am 10 years old,(I have two older brothers who were in their teens when Rush's debut album came out). I still think that RUSH is the best Rock band ever.This DVD disapoints me. The venue is less attractive, The cinematography and editing seems to have been done without any real heart into it. The songs rush through with what seems to me like haste. At one point Alex nods to Neil that they are half way. Like they can't wait for the concert to finish! Rush seems less professional. To me the best Rush Concert on DVD is still the Snakes & Arrows one. There they seem more in top form."
3,"Yeah it's that ""Time""","Okay so im checking out this new Rush: Time Machine concert DVD and I have to say a few things. First off, Geddy just doesnt have the voice anymore. He has to strain to hit the high notes that were a constant for him years ago. 2nd, both Alex and Neil are showing their age and their limitations that come with it. Overall, unless they decide to just do instrumentals of all their songs then IMO its time for them to hang it up."
4,what did you do wrong on the bluray sound mix????,"I by chance ended up purchasing both the dvd & bluray copies of this recording. I first received the dvd as a gift. I thought it sounded so darn good, I gave my dvd copy to a dear friend & purchased the bluray. These two discs are NOT the same mixdown for 5.1. The blueray is about half as dynamic as the dvd"
1,NO AUDIO!!!!,"I have to say that I was very excited to get this DVD since this was the first Rush tour I have seen so far. I was very confused and disappointed to discover that the audio dies after the opening advertisements. First we thought it was the TV or the DVD player, but we tested out the disc on another player with the same results. There just isn't any point to watching a Rush concert without the sound; the audio is the whole experience!!! Very disappointed, I am trying to find another manufacturer to buy this from."
3,Reviews???,How can there already be 32 reviews on a product that won't be released for another two months? You can review the band. You can review the show. But you can't review the DVD if it isn't out yet.
1,Very bad digital video recording audio pretty decent,"Short & Sweet: The video quality is terrible. I know there may be a lot of smoke in Cleveland, but not as much as this video shows. During the dark passages from afar in the arena you can see some king of ""Matrix"" like effect in the background of the picture. It looks like it was already ripped to Xvid and posted to the web then upconverted to DVD. I can't wait to see the Blu-ray version. The video will probably still suck horribly, but maybe the audio will be even better.This was a major major disappointment on the same day as the Pink Floyd Wish You Were Here Immersion boxed set.Today's Rush releases are the worst thing ever released in their catalog even worse than the Vapor Trails mastering."
1,Worst SHOW!,"This has got to be the worst performance, EVER. Geddy Lee can't hit the high notes like he used to. I do not know why they just didnt cover Mike Ness songs. Maybe then they might be tolerable.I can offer a review of that venue: good place to go to watch LeBron James throw down thunder dunks, boring place to see a concert. I did see several concerts there while I lived in Cleveland (Aerosmith, Smashing Pumpkins, The Who, Tom Petty, Roger Waters), but those arena shows are all the same. I did enjoy seeing LBJ throw down thunder dunks there a few times as well, but now he appears there less frequently and with a different backing band."
1,Blu-Ray sound? Doubt it......,"I only have a 2-channel system (a really, really good 2-channel system though)so I can only comment on the Dolby 2.0 sound; the worst sounding blu-ray I have ever heard. The sound was distant, almost like it had a muted quality to it. I'll probably never watch/listen to this DVD again; I cannot recommend it's purchase to anyone with a decent system that cares about sound quality."
1,Snore,"This book is by far the biggest waste of money and time I've encountered recently. It covers none of the basics of drawing human portraits - no proportions, no placement of features. It's simply a narrative of what ""the artist"" is doing at the moment. I was bored silly by the book, didn't get anything out of it, and the cover isn't even pretty enough for a coffee table book. I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn portrait drawing. However, if you are troubled with insomnia, this may be a good choice."
2,not what I expected,"I beleive the book is misrepresented,it really doesn't go into alot of detail(which when your a budding artist you need)not a good beginners book."
5,Chely Wright: Wish Me Away,"This documentary is amazing! It details the journey that Chely Wright went through to come to the best place she could be in to come out as a lesbian. There have been some that have said that Chely came out of the closet as a media tool to boost her career. This documentary proves all of those people 100% wrong. As you watch the video you can easily see the pain and fear she goes through while working toward her coming out. After viewing this video I challenge anyone to say that her coming out was to gain a few record sales.Watch the video and see for yourself what an amazingly courageous woman she is. She will truly inspire you. And if you haven't read her book I encourage you to do so. ""Like Me: Confessions of a Heartland Country Singer"" is by far one of the best books I've ever read. I've gifted it a dozen times or more and everyone that has read it has been moved by its message."
5,One of the best Japanese games out there.,This is one of the best games in the Phantasy Star series. I love this game as much as Final Fantasy. This game is difinitely more action RPG than the previous series. This game can played offline or online.
4,Great fun for the lovers of mindless button-mashing-monster-slaughter (that actually isn't very mindless)!,"I bought this game for my siblings because we love to play the portable version on the PSP and the Xbox 360. It's great fun with a big party and we spend hours goofing off together. However, none of us can take this game seriously and we all make fun of it's story. In my opinion, this isn't the game for you if you are into the more serious RPG's that you can actually really get into and feel the game and it's characters. But if you love a fun game to just goof on and slaughter a TON of monsters with your buddies, then definitely get this one for your collection! The only problem we had was that it refused to run on my brother's computer. The reason is unknown for it worked on everyone's computer except his and it didn't really tell us why it wouldn't run. It installed perfectly and would boot to the main screen and then quit when he tried to play it."
1,"This product ""Sucks""","I purchased this product to renew the black trim on my pickup truck. When first applied, it seems to be working but after applying and buffing as instructed, then letting it dry I noticed streaks on my trim work. I priceeded to try it at another location, then another but all my attempts left the same ugly streaks. The dulled flat black oxidized look return along with streaks from the Mothers Trim Care product. I wouldn't recommed this to anyone.. It is a total waste.. you wont even get a minimal improvement. Two Thumbs Down!"
1,Worthless,I bought this product to use on my Yakima roofrack plastics which are badly sun faded. Didn't do a thing and they look the same as before. I wasted $10. Tried on my black car trims and barely makes a difference there. Not recommended by me.
4,"Works well, but requires monthly application (as expected)","This product will help make your plastic shine like new! Use a liberal amount. Also, keep in mind that, like any other plastic conditioner, you will likely need to apply this every month or so to keep your plastic and vinyl trim looking tip top."
2,wash away with rain,"looks good for a few time, but is temporary, is better suited for a person who wants to sell a car and wants to give a good impression to the buyer.. otherwise, the product will go away with rain or water, so you will have to reapply it again and again."
3,"Looks good when new, but doesn't last long","I have a 2003 G35 that has black trim around the bottom of the car that's starting to fade. I picked up some Back to Black to attempt to save them. It works great at first.. I get a nice deep black that brings back the original look, but after a few weeks it starts to fade. I guess every time I wash the car I'm going to have to add another step. IMHO, it's worth the extra time as the faded trim really ruins my otherwise good looking car!"
2,"Should Have Listened to The Name, Not The Label.","I purchased this product to shine up the gray and black trim on my 2003 Vibe with 110,XXX miles. On the black trim, both glossy and flat - wow! Excellent product. Removes oxidation, and gives it a single color, just great. However, on the gray it was a most horrible product. Now, you are saying: ""Wait! This is Back-to-Black, why did you use it on non-black trim?"" Well I used it on the gray because both labels said I could with the same effects as the black, no matter the trim color. However, on the gray it was runny and splotchy. For this they recommend that I buff harder, I did every level of buffing until my power buffer came out. I used my 6"" power buffer to no avail; still splotchy and runny. I tried again on a later date and had the same results. In short, the product though marketed for use on all trim is in fact only useful for black trim, or at least my experience proves this."
1,Junk,I have used this on my over door black trim many times and it will not make it like new or reduce fading. Do not waste your money on this worthless product.
5,Bumper show room new again,"I have an 2003 year car that have grey colored plastic bumpers that had become almost chalky white from the elements. Co-worker had recommeded that I buy this and he was sure it would restore the bumpers to like new. ""Mothers back to black"" is amazing my car bumpers now looks like they did when I puchased the car new back in 2003. I now have my shiny dark grey plastic bumpers back, my neighbor thought I had them replaced in fact."
2,Not that good,"I have used this over the years on my Jeep trim and on my Mustangs rear honey comb panel and chin spoiler. It was a real pain to use on the jeeps trim. Once done it only lasted a few days and didn't look all that black. It did an ok job on the rear panel of my mustang but again only lasted a few days. I then found a bottle of Meguiars Gold Class Trim Detailer and tried that. What a night and day difference, I will never use Mothers Back-To-Black again. The Meguiars Gold went on much better then Back to Black and makes all my trim and paneling look %100 better while lasting weeks not days."
3,"Good, but better products out there.","Bought as a filler and because i needed a trim detailers as i ran out of my Meguiar's Gold Class Trim Detailer. While this works well, its not close to the Meguair's brand. This stuff is like milky water, the Meguiar's brand is a gel you rub in. I found I had to apply it a couple times to get it to stay there and shine and since it was a watery substance, i had to watch where my towel was hanging so i dint get all over my paint, etc.. Just one big mess. Also the Meguiar's had the best SMELL, which may not mean much to the average joe, but can't hurt if used in a car show. Ill use this bottle up, but after that im back to the Meguiar's Gold Class Trim Detailer."
5,Fantasic! Does a great job,"This stuff works fantastic. I have a lot of black bumpers on my car, and after applying this the car really looks like new. It makes a bigger difference than I expected. You do need to reapply it every few months or so to keep the effect going."
5,Great Product,Did wonders for my grey panels on my Honda Element. Brought them back to new. And no streaking after wet weather.
2,Mothers Back to Black - Until it gets wet!,"I bought this stuff and was pretty impressed with the results of it since I applied the stuff in the summer. But when it started to rain or if the car got wet, this stuff will come off and then in order to restore the look, you have to reapply it again. There is apparently better stuff but since I wasn't aware of it, I didn't know better and the geeks at the autostore recommended the stuff. I guess the stuff is ok if your car never gets wet and you don't mind having to reapply the stuff. I however don't want to have to reapply this stuff as there was a lot of labor involved in trying to improve the look of the trim pieces on the car."
4,Great product period!!!!,I almost gave up trying to restore my trim until I found this on message board. Wow is all I can say. Trim is nice an shiny now. Not only does it shines but it also protects and cleans the trim. No more faded black color and it lasts for a few weeks! I must admit I was a little skeptical at first. One gripe its very very liquidy so it runs all over if u put on too much. Would be nice if it was a little thick.
2,"It works ok, but not that great.","I applied it to many different surfaces, ranging from rubber to hard plastic. On the rubber items it looked good,softer plastic it was ok, but even after multiple applications it just didn't work on hard plastic trim. Still just gray and faded. Not black."
4,"Very Good, A Little Short Of Great","Area to be treated must be very clean and free of all oil/tar/debris. With this preparation, the product is quite good. With this having been done, there was some streaking after a steady day and a half of rain which was dissappointing."
3,Best on Interior,I tried this on my Exterior Black sidings and bumpers and it doesn't last long. But on the interior black this product works well. It keeps my interior black and new look. I gave this an OK product but not really impressed with it. Let's see how long my interior look last on this Black to Black product. But for now it's an OK product.
5,"Gentlemen, start your businesses!","As a business owner, I am quite pleased with the information I was able to extract from this book.It will not make you rich overnight, but it will explain patiently the unique challenges of starting and operating an Internet-based business.Not all ideas are VC-worthy and this book describes the basic VC premises.The case studies are quite in-depth and definitely will help you avoid same mistakes. The author does not shy away from early failures and fatal choices of wrong business partners.In short, you'll enjoy the book and learn many things. I highly recommend it to any enterpreneur."
5,The best Bach Keyboad Partitas on Piano!,"J. Scott Morrison, a previous reviewer, is right. Craig Sheppard's playing is absolutely fabulous. (On the other hand, Russell M. Sackowitz should get his earwax removed, seriously. How can he describe this lively and exuberant playing as ""mechanical""?) I previously downloaded this recording from itunes for my ipod. (I usually listen to Bach on my ipod while I'm exercising in the gym.) But I wanted to have it in CD version, and so I ordered it directly from Craig Sheppard. Both the CD booklet and the CD itself have the pianist's sign and short message: how thoughtful he is! I like Craig Sheppard's playing slightly more than those of Tureck (meditative and introspective) and Perahia (elegant and zingy); much more than Hewitt, Schiff, Roberts.... I also like Partita 1 by Tomsic, and Partita 2 by Argerich. (If only they record the entire six Patitas!)"
1,ALL THE TAPES WERE THE SAME,"PAID POSTAGE OPENED PACKAGE FOR BIRTHDAY PARTY.THE TAPES WERE ALL THE SAME. BIRTHDAY PARTY OVER,THANKS AMAZON"
5,I love Imaginary Friends,"I still love this series! It's a shame that it isn't on tv anymore but with these you'll find all those episodes you laughed along with! I watched them all back to back and I was surprised by how many episodes I missed! It's a great deal for a lot of cartoon viewing. Cartoon series on dvd are ideal for cartrips or sickdays and this one is entertaining, fun, and the animation is pretty good.11/26/12 Edit: If you're a fan of Dexter's Laboratory, Powerpuff Girls, Edgar & Ellen, Total Drama and more recently Gravity Falls, you'll love this series."
4,FHFIF recomendation,DVDs arrived nicely wrapped in plastic. I get to watch my fav episodes and I like the bonus features like info on the characters and a few little funny bits where there would normally be a commercial break.
4,A sexy twist on a classic fairy tale,"Pinocchia is a charming adult graphic-novel which puts a spin on the traditional Pinocchio fairy-tale.First of all, to describe this Pinocchia one must first compare it to another artist with a similar style: Manara. Gibrat & Leroi weave a fine book with sexy art, enjoyable story, and a lovely fairy-tale heroine all rolled up in one package. The art is quite nice, and although the book is not fully explicit (like a Manara)the scenes are well executed (albeit brief). There is also a great deal of humor which is properly pulled off and won't leave the reader hanging (unlike Manara, on occasions). Another pleasant touch is that this story is (at times) read with a narrarator perspective, adding to the fairy-tale illusion.Overall, it's a worthy addition to the graphic novel section."
5,An essential for every physician,This book does in 200 compact pages what most medical textbooks attempt to accomplish in 800 pages. It covers virtually every primary care topic faced in an outpatient setting and I can carry it in my shirt pocket. I love it!
5,Great medical book,"Simply put, I would not be able to survive in my busy practice without the assistance of this book. A steal for the price"
3,Ignore the 1st Seven Reviews...,"They are all dated January 21, 2004 and I highly doubt they are real, honest reviews. I'm not sure the other two reviews are real either. This is one Tarascon edition I'd rather see before buying (unlike their Pharmacopia)."
2,It's adequate.,"This camera takes very nice photos outside in natural light. The pictures are horrible inside with the flash. The flash is too bright. There is a long lag time after you press the shutter button, you have to wait about 2 to 5 seconds to take the picture. So basically you get what you paid for. It's a good camera for my kids to fool around with."
1,horrible camera,"We bought this camera for our daughter a year ago and have had nothing but misery since then. 99% of the pics come out with poor resolution. My husband and I have both tried to make it work better figuring user error on the part of our 15 yr old.... but alas no... the camera is just worthless. The lighting is never right. It is too bright so the pic is faded out or too dark so you can hardly see what you took a picture of. I often end up getting out my cell phone camera and taking a better pic and sending to an online place for printing with better results. It takes forever to take the pic so you sit there trying to hold the camera still enough with the pic often being blurry. Don't waste your money on this one, you'll regret it!"
1,Run away run away!,"It's just an awful camera that is packaged to sell, but takes poor photos and is difficult to use. The LCD screen on the back is tiny and grainy. The pictures are dark and blurry. The lens on the front is not covered and so can be scratched. Spend a little more and get a camera that you will actually want to use."
1,Camera,"I recieved the camera and it didn't work, No power to the camera. So I had to ship it back and they say up to 2 weeks to get a new one which sucks because it was my sons christmas gift and now he's not going to get his main gift. Cheep product and way to much hassel , Next time I will go to a local store for stuff like this."
3,More fun than a barrel of Coelophysises,"Isn't it wonderful that the latest dinosaur finds can make their way into a children's book so quickly? This collaboration between paleontologist Philip J. Currie, children's nature writer Colleayn O. Martin, and illustrator Jan Sovak is a fact-filled visual treat. This is a presentation of about two dozen recently discovered or described dinosaurs. There's a half-page of description, a sidebar of taxonomy and vital stats, and on the facing page is a colorful, dramatic painting of the critter in life. Your kids love dinosaurs as much as you did, right? So what are you waiting for? You can't miss with this one."
5,very good WAX only!,"I got these for my brand new car since you do not really need to polish a new car. They work great. They pure Carnauba with no garbage added so you can rub them on any surface of your car and they do not leave a white film on, which is a huge bonus. They do give a nice shine and you really feel the protection they provide. I strongly recommend this WAX."
5,Love it!! Worth the money!!,"This is my first Mothers product ever! And I cannot believe the outcome! I'm a big fan of Mcguiar for years, but I'm starting to change my throught now. Easy to apply...eaxy to take it off. No white dry residue. However the smell is too strong. It's like I put 3 tube of Bengay on me :)"
4,ooh smells like bananas,"how excited can you be about waxing your car really, i was like this isnt too bad then after an hour i was like FFS this is taking too looonnggg....but it did smell like fruit & is supposed to protect my paint ? so im giving it a miserable 4 stars. 5 if the product applied itself"
3,meh...,"After reading the reviews I was hopeful this would be the wax I used for my new black mustang. Unfortunately it won't be. It went on pretty well, no issues. It was a little tough to take off however, and required a decent amount of elbow grease and several passes with multiple clean micro towels to buff it off. It kept wanting to leave spotty streaks all over the car.once everything was done, I wasn't very impressed with the way the car felt. It was not smooth at all. This is a new car, and I used Mothers micropolish glaze just hours before. A clean microfiber would not slide anywhere across the car. It rained 2 days later however, and water beaded up and ran off the car like it was being chased. So at least that part worked well. It did not, however, make my car look any more shiny or wet looking than it already was.decent stuff, maybe others will have better results on different cars/finishes. Just didn't do much for mine"
4,Good but not great,"I was expecting a better shine than the one I got. It was good but not great. However, the scent was incredible. I would use it again just for that."
1,No wonder its so cheap.,This game is just sad. I played the first area and got bored. Its just not fun.
2,"I'm no sonic fan, but this game blows","I read the reviews, but I thought I'd still try it. It couln't be that bad. Here's the bad i found:1. Sonic kind of freezes up waiting for tails to catch up.2. There's just too many long loading times in the same level. For any activity there's a loading time.3. The characters and town look boxy. It's not 3rd generation. It looks Sega Genesis quality.4.You have to ""talk"" to pretty much every character in town. And most of them tell you useless crap."
1,What's up with sonic here?,"This game just down right HORROBLE. Did sega rush through this game?Camera is HORRIBLE, wich needs to be decently good.VOICE ACTING???Human characters make these wierd sounds. The Text messages should have only existed for this failure.So many other mistakes to list. Now getting to the point!!!Don't know if sega had to rush the game so they can meet a relese deadline or what????????. The most important part's of this ""not considered game"" are missing.This is an incomplete game that should have not been released when it did.If the developers gave this game a few more weeks of development, I am sure people would have appreciated it more.Instead it became a waste of resources, blu-ray disk, time, and money.Whoever released Sonic like this should be relieved of their job.Sonic needs to be rethinked from the Dreamcast days. DREAMCAST was the last time Sonic showed what he is made of."
1,Terrible game,"I think this game should be recalled. There are too many issues to list but a couple are: extremely slow load times, too many areas in game where disk needs to load, bad point of view on characters (meaning you can't see where the character is going because the screenshot is showing an area that is of no importance), maneuverability of characters is terrible. I have never written a review of a product but hopefully this will save people money and they will buy a different game."
2,Stay away. You have been warned!,"If you read through the net, you will find very similiar comments on this game regardless of the platform. 95% of the reviews for this game are bad. A few personal comments. While the CGI for the crossover scenes between levels are decent (not that great but ok), the graphics during the game play is dissapointing. The basic game play is aweful too. I found myself dying not because of being killed by a villain but rather from me falling off some cliff (or rather) due to bad camera angles. It's not fun when you don't have a reason to die and yet you do. If you want to be frustrated for hours, then get it. Or else, save your money and buy a better game."
1,Don't Buy It,"Sega really flopped on this one. I treid playing it for a few hours..the camera angles, yes you can adjust them..but as soon as you start running again, they resume their same terrible view point. This is the biggest waste of my money...Don't buy it!"
2,Do not buy,"This game is, in a nutshell, unfinished. The core of the game is flawed because not enough time was spent on programming. The long load times are not an exaggeration, go to youtube and search for sonic load times. The video's are not doctored, it will really take 5 minutes to do a mission which requires 1 minute of play. And the worst part is many of these glitches and load times could have been fixed. Easily. So shame on you SEGA for trying to deceive your fans by calling this beta version a completed game. THATS NO GOOD!"
1,LOADING....LOADING>>>>>LOADING>>>>>>>,This game takes way too long to load. I can't believe the amount of time I waste waiting for things to load. I thought that one of the things they were going to cut down on with the ps3 were the number of transitions and loads necessary to play even the most hardware intensive games. At least games like call to duty 3 have a story line that plays while things are loading. Then to top it off the game just isn't that much fun. I was bored in the first 45 minutes I owned the game. I went and traded it in for tonyhawk. Much more entertaining for my money. I would definitely rent this one before buying it.
2,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!,"Sonic is a game that you should only rent. I've played a good handfull of PS3 games, such as resistance, madden, need for speed and tony hawk and none of these games were as hard as sonic is to master. I do not like the gameplay at all, text boxes get in the way, there are more than one action assigned to a certain control and sometimes the game freezes my playstation 3. There are many problems wrong with the Sonic game and i could probably go on. Half the time you don't even control sonic and he will fall off the track. SEGA should have spent a lot more time perfecting this game. The graphics, however, are a nice feature... state of the art graphics and the enemies are beatable. Those are the only two things I like about sonic. I stood it out and beat the game but it was hard. Final verdict- the game is a good game if you like to get mad because sonic won't do what you tell him to do. I've played a lot of PS3 games and this is by far the worst, besides marvel alliance."
1,Sega really killed Sonic's name with this one,"The game was rushed. The instruction manual says there are things in the game, that in fact, never made it in the final release. The load times are totaly unacceptable, incredibly long load times for just five seconds of either a CG or mini-game instruction. The controls are HORRIBLE and in some areas, the ground is there, but you can still fall through. The slowdown in this game is UNBEARABLE and the camery WILL KILL YOU. Try to avoid this game alltogether, unless you don't mind playing 20 dollars for it."
4,Sonic Review,"Just bought this game and so far it's pretty good. The speed at which Sonic moves still blows my mind. The only gripe I have is the camera angles which can sometimes get in the way. Other than that, it's very fun to play."
2,leave it be,"You want to talk about a disappointment. The Playstation 3 is supposed to show off amazing graphical improvements compared to the PS2, and yet, this Sonic game doesn't do ANYTHING at all to show off the consoles supposed ""amazing power"".Also, this game is pretty bad because the trademark of Sonic the Hedgehog is supposed to be speed, and yet, he's SLOWER than ever in this game. Also the levels are pretty tough and the controls aren't anywhere near as good as the old Sonic games on the Sega Genesis. A rushed game with mistakes all over the place that should be avoided."
3,Sonic is best in 2D,"Read the title of my review, you get the gist of what I thought about the game. Not so good.Thanks for reading."
2,Bargin bin only... if that.,"I was a huge fan of Sonic in the Genesis days, but any 3D version has been a dissapointment, and this game is no different. The camera has been the biggest issue and the trend continues for this one. Speed is Sonic's gig and they just haven't figured out a way to mesh that with a 3D world, but they are getting closer. There were parts that showed promise, but it still doesn't make it a good game. Playable for only the most hardcore Sonic fans."
2,Sonic the Hedgehog,I wasn't was I was expecting for this game. Last time I've played was when I had a segacd.
3,best game ever:!!!!!!!!!!!,I love this game but their are soooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!! many load screens for 1 second clips but also you can play 2 other players and their great action I now what the guys are saying but I recommd this gameI now what those other guys are saying but I recommd this game
3,Sonic Should go Back to 2D Sidescolling,"If you fell in love with Sonic on the Sega Genesis, you may want to pickup the Sega compilation for the PS2. This game is a 3D open-area platformer with some RPG elelments thrown in. There are some very frustrating elements to this game...and you'll find yourself asking yourself how you can move onto the next level because you frankly cannot figure out what you need to do."
1,All The Worst Parts Of Gaming In A Single Game,"If you can't get enough of frequent and long load times, illogical story lines, frustrating controls, and lame attempts to turn a formerly fun, fanciful game into a hardcore RPG, then lucky you! You've found the game of your dreams in Sonic for PS3This game tries too hard in all the wrong areas-- the opening scene is dazzlingly beautiful and intricately detailed, but why exactly is this Final Fantasy-esque sequence pasted on a game about a blue rodent who runs really fast?-- and doesn't give any thought to playability or flow-through.Unless you're doing your doctorate thesis on how popular game franchises grossly misinterpret the desires of their customers, this game will probably be a waste of your cash."
1,Rip sonic you will never be the same again,"This was a complete failure, this was'nt the sonic i new and liked this was a waste of time, the storymode sucked, the 2player was kinda difficult, and i gottan board of this game. This game was trash sega really mest up this opertunity, so this was a whack game."
3,Serious Sonic Fans ONLY,if your not addicted to sonic like i am then there is nothing redeemable about this game for you... even with out the 15 minute loading times every 2 seconds it still would not be all that great... the only reason it gets such a high score from me is because i love all that is sonic ( even the [...] like this ) and cause Mephiles is the coolest villan since hyper metal sonic
4,It's a blast but...,"I really like this game. It is very exciting and very entertaining. I especially like how there are three different story modes, one for each hedgehog. The ONLY thing which drives me crazy is the load time. You have to wait over a minute each time you enter a new place, even if you have already been there. Also, for missions, you accept the mission, LOAD, get the instructions on the mission, and with ""Ready, Go!"", you get to load again for a minute! A complete waste of time. Other than that, this game is awesome"
3,It's Sonic...,"Yes, load times are longer than other games... so what? This DVD includes firmware update 1.32. You need fimware 1.32 to play this. If you do not, you can update from the DVD.Graphics are very good."
5,A very good game!,"I know a lot of people hate and hate and hate on this game because of the load time, the inconvenient camera, and tons and tons of other aggravating problems. But maybe If you can just look past those then you can find an excellent game well wort the price. The story is excellent and the graphics are outstanding."
1,"Bad game play, bad control and bad camera movment","Hi,I tried playing this game for few hours. My opinion is that it does not worth the money.One it takes too long to download, second the control of the character is bad and the camera movement is even worst.But worst of all the game play and the story line is awful.Ziv"
3,A game of fairly good quality,"Considering there aren't many games for the PS3, I would call this one of the more improved ones. The graphics, especially the opening scene, are excellent, crisp and fresh, however the gameplay is not. The character often gets plastered to walls, and even with the instruction manual, this game is still hard to play. I would recommend this if you have a PS3 and are looking for a select game collection, but otherwise I wouldn't."
2,The blue hedgehog isn't what he used to be...,"Okay, so we all know Sonic's games haven't been doing much justice as of late, and this one is no exception. On a whim, I gave in and said I would see for myself just how bad it has gotten. poor controls, missions have little to no fun value and I won't even start with how frustratingly long the loading screens are. There is some good to the game though. The cutscenes are well done with stunning visuals and voiceovers. The soundtrack is done well, though not as memorable as some previous Sonic games. The game definitely takes Sonic in a different direction with a vast and interesting storyline with new enemies, Robotnik's devious schemes and a new collection of playable characters, such as Silver the Hedgehog and Blaze the Cat. Even with this new lineup, the gameplay fails to deliver and further slows down the blue hedgehog's momentum.Rating: 2/5"
3,too long to load,"i love sonic...it never gets old, but this game just killed it on loading time. it is ridiculous, first it needs to load to start the game then it needs to load for about 15 secs just to hear the story then another 15 seconds to load to start the mission then another 15 seconds when you pass or fail the mission, this killed it to me and i consider myself a patient person!!but the game itself is interesting i just didn't finish because of the waiting"
1,"Very disappointing, bad graphics, bad controls and gameplay",Pros: It has sonic on the cover; the case can be used to store another disk after burning this one; you can start a fire with the user's manualCons: Graphics are worse than on PS2; controls and camera don't work well; music makes my ears bleedI hate this game and I hate myself for wasting the money. You'd rather want to spend it on a nice meal or getting a $#@! j0b instead.
2,Good graphics. Terrible gameplay.,"This is hands-down the worst game I have ever played. I would much rather play tetris on an original gameboy than the new Sonic on the PS3. Poor gameplay, quirky camera, lame new characters, lenghty distance between saves, boring levels. Rent it first, you WILL be dissappointed."
1,An absolute waste of time,"I used to be a huge fan of sonic. I played the genesis games, Sonic CD on my PC, Sonic R, Sonic Adventure, Adventure 2, I even enjoyed heroes. But at the time of this games release, I didn't have a PS3 or Xbox 360 so I never picked it up. Little did I know how fortunate I was. This game is unplayable. It takes way too long to load, which it does frequently. It is also impossible to control with a terrible camera. And anytime you touch anything the game glitches, often resulting in death. Also, the graphics are downright terrible in certain spots, like Nintendo 64 quality. Don't buy this game unless youre the biggest sonic fan ever and just need it for display. If you need sonic on the PS3, but Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection or Sonic Generations. Even download Sonic Adventure over PSN if you must, but avoid this nightmare of a game."
3,Maybe an OK for Sonic fans,"When I played this, I felt kinda excited. Even though the cutscenes were cool, the gameplay was kinda tough. Sonic's story took me 7 days. Silver's took me 5 days. Shadows took me 3.5 days. The final story took me 2. Some levels were easy as certain characters. If you want a really easy sonic game, don't get it. I didn't bother trying to get all S rank."
2,"Same old Sonic, Really poor programing!","I must agree with many of the other reviewers. I purchased this because I thought it would be fun for a freind and I to play sonic like the good old days. Well, I was horribly shocked to find that this has the great graphics and speed of sonic when it is not loading, and the controls are awful to use here. The camera angle keeps wanting to go straigh above the character when you start to run, making it at times impossible to see where your shooter is that is killing you. It really makes the game difficult to enjoy because you are always stopping and tilting the camera. It is possible to make progress, but there is a steep learning curve. Not recommended for young users because it is so tough to hold your attention haing to stop the action all the time to adjust. I'm glad I got it at 1/5 original cost. Good luck in gaming, but skip this one even if you really like sonic."
1,Don't buy it,"Awful product, as other reviewers have stated. If you want to get funny games for your kids, buySurfs UporRatatouilleinstead."
5,Batteries,"Excellent batteries. I have a few sets for my Sony DSC-W1 and they work really nicely. Regular alkaline batteries work for about ten pictures, these Sony batteries work for over 80-90 pictures."
2,Camera,Was supposed to be in stock and I paid for expediated service. was not even shipped until a week later.It was to be delivered in two to three days.Poor service.Very unacceptable.
3,not the battery i needed,"amazon paired this up with the camera i bought but they do not go together so i wasted whatever dough it cost, i think 5 or 10 bucks.the batteries may be fine but I'll never know."
1,Don't make the same mistake!!!,"I am very disappointed with the product. I charged the batteries over night but from the moment that I inserted them in my photo camera they had only enough energy to show that they are empty. I thought I made a mistake and I re-charged them again. No results. I had to use the rechargeable batteries that I already had. I know is not the fault of the re-charger, it is the right re-charger for NiMH batteries.This order was a 100% waste of time and money. I think they sent me over-used or very old batteries. I feel sorry that I was too lazy to go to a store.The seller name was IHITEK."
2,Good for one year. After that does not hold charge,"I used these batteries for one year from the date of purchase and they were excellent. I used them for Sony digital camera and could shoot more than 150 pictures before I had to recharge them. I do use my camera frequently and would have charged these batteries almost 30 times in the first year. After using it for an year, they became useless. They ceased to hold charge and used to last only for 40 to 50 photos per charge. Hence I discarded them and bought Duracell batteries which are still lasting after 2 years of purchase."
4,happy with these batteries!,Really happy with these batteries. The charge lasts a really long time. Although in cold weather (snow) the charge only lasted a day.
4,"Good, but wish they lasted longer","My H5 sucks the life out of these batteries faster than I'd like (a fresh charge lasts less than a day with moderate use)....though that is more of an issue with my camera as opposed to the batteries. Even so, the price is good and they do what they're supposed to."
2,Meh.,"Having relatively little experience with rechargeable batteries, I found these to be to short lived lasting less than 6 hours in my Cyber shot. They also do NOT hold a charge for more than a week when stored."
4,Camera Batteries,These batteries came in quickly and worked great. I will be using them for some time. I really think Amazon is a very customer oriented site.
3,Eco battery,What a great battery. I love the rechargeables and it helps the environment. I only gave this 3 stars because these don't last as long as the first ones I had. I will definately buy this product again. I suggest having two sets so you always have one set charged.
3,Bed of Spices,"Good historical novel but almost felt like I had read it before, maybe I had, not sure. I did enjoy it though."
5,A timeless love story!!,"This is worth any price to read! The story is so rich with details and passion that you feel part of the story. The characters are so developed and intriguing, you cannot help to be their biggest fans. I highly recommend this book to all those that love romance novels!!"
3,dull,why is this book rated so highly? this is a decidedly average book. Particularly missing wit and warmth.
3,A good read,I really rather enjoyed this one. Good enough to keep you interested but not so great you read through the night and put it down as your climbing in the shower for work the next day....
1,really boring,i got my money back for this book. i told the representative that i just could not finish it. it was not very expensive so i was just going to read it. i had bought it without reading the first chapter because i liked her other books then i regretted it from the page 10 probably. this book is very bland. nothing is happening. no chemistry. dull conversation. the backdrop of this story is very unique and interesting but that is about it. what a waste of a plot...i really detest it when the h/h look at each other and then without any building up of a meaningful relationship or any events they just can't wait to bed each other.
3,ehm......I was looking for more,"It was not bad really. I generally agree with the reviews. The author's writing style is palatable and she has good flow. However if like me you read medievals for deeper plots than 'will they or won't they be together?' this book may not be for you. I mean towards the end I was basically 'jumping ahead'( that means the plot has lost my interest)for the inevitable 'the author will never let any thing bad happen to her characters' ending. There was nothing more left to unravel, just that. I wish she had spent a few more pages delving into the persecution of the jews and also more into the troubled sister's life. I thought these plot points could have made for a richer story rather than just a mere love story. I give it 3 stars for good writing and somewhat interesting story overall but I hoped for real suspense and did not get it."
4,Review of A Bed of Spices,"A Bed of Spices by Barbara Samuel is a wonderful period romance novel that is well-written, rich with historical detail, and entertaining from start to finish. The story centers around Rica and Solomon, and their forbidden romance. Set in the 1300's, the book deals with the plague and its subsequent impact on the Jewish population who were among those falsely blamed for the Black Death. Rica and Solomon can't help falling in love, but circumstances keep them apart.There are several sub-plots woven throughout as well. I found the book to be a very enjoyable read, extremely romantic, and at times even sensual. The love scenes are handled with finesse.I feel Barbara Samuel has captured a strong sense of the era along with the breathless excitement of first love. I would recommend this book to any reader who enjoys period romance done with style."
4,different idea for story,"enjoyed this story, different location, Germany instead of France or England. a little different time zone and it was very interesting."
5,bed of spices- incredible,One of the best books I've ever read. Vivid descriptions and interesting characters!! I really loved it and will read again.
1,Hide from this book!,"I enjoyed the first book in this series, but how did this book even get published? There was practically NO story and what remained was confusing... I was also disturbed by the coldness of the romance - first the romantic male lead sleeps with the heroine to ""get the job done"", only to kidnap her and hold her hostage, THEN she falls in love with him???I agree with one of the previous reviewers - the cat was the only convincing character!"
3,Just OK,"This towel is just ""ok"". It's akin to the cheap towels used to clean the machines at the gym. The decals are just iron-on and doubtful they will survive many cycles in the wash."
3,Naked nuns on rollerskates chase evil doers.,This is one of the best sexploitation movies. Many original ideas and quite a bit of humor. Not for everyone but if you like a little originality with your nudity then this ones for you.
2,Not a bad movie - needs a re-edit job though,This movie has one of the best ideas for movies - just needs to keep some of the healing scenes out of it. If certain scenes were cut out - this would be great on most tv movie shows. One Star for its Lead Actress and one star for the idea
2,I ordered this?,"This movie was off the charts bad, I think I typed in the wrong title, ordered this film because I could not remember the title of the film I actually wanted to order and wow, was this disappointing!"
4,Unique Book,"This book covers major events in US foreign policy, such as the World Wars, Vietnam and Korea, Cold War, and Iran. Each chapter provides a survey of the event, dates, and details. These portions are sometimes a little difficult to follow (for example, to grasp the timeline of events). The most interesting part of this book is the inclusion of a lage amount of actual documents pertaining to each crisis. for example, excerpts from presidential correspondence, NSC reports, and other diplomatic materials. This is most interesting, to see the events thru the eyes of the actual participants."
1,"Might As Well Call It ""How To SPAM""","I checked this book out at my local library thinking there might actually be something useful to help me diversify my online income. I was greatly disappointed.Not only does this book repeat what just about every other book on earning money online talks about, but it also involves many things that could be considered SPAM and annoying practices. The author states he is against those practices and insists that his techiniques are fine, but I can't help but get a bit sick to my stomach when reading his tips.Also, he claims its super-easy to make lots of quick money, but even with his deceiptful tactics, you will still need a good product (which he doesn't tell you how to develop) in order to sell anything worthwhile.Please do yourself and the rest of the Internet community a favor and don't both with this book."
1,Multiple streams of dishonest income.,"Allen's system is shady and manipulative. Very little value is being added to the world. There are millions of crappy websites out there just like his, why is he teaching and encouraging others to make more? It makes the Internet that much worse."
2,Oversell in Overdrive,"Master of self-promotion Robert G. Allen has plenty of ideas about how to use words and technology to hype yourself and your business. There's just one tiny thing missing from this forumula: He doesn't tell you how to get this great idea to hype.He also manages to skirt the truth. For example, he talks about how he made an online offer that became an instant success in 24 hours. He leaves out the time he spent developing a website and the lists of interested prospects to which the offer was distributed. If we add in the time spent building up to making the offer, it isn't exactly a instant success story anymore.It takes time and effort to develop a business. Allen can dress those facts up in hype -- he's good at it -- but the only business this book will build is Allen's. If your at the point where you have a good idea, a website, and prospects, Allen's ideas may be useful."
3,Great Theoretical Underpinnings,"In today's economic climate it sure is a great idea to have multiple streams of income and no one tells this story better than Robert Allen. But for pure pragmatic strategy and analytical brainstorming on how to really make this work I prefer Scott Fox's new book, ""Internet Riches"". A serious book that has a straight forward plan that takes you step-by-step through the (not very) technical steps to a business plan, a new business and a new life."
2,ehh...not that great,The internet marketing world is so overcrowded that it may be impossible to make consistant returns. This book does have decent info for beginers but i doubt anyone will get rich quick on the techniques described in this book. save your money and invest.
5,Robert Allen book,"Good content, easy read, easy application. Worth the time to read. Learned several thing I never knew before. How much is one good idea worth?"
1,Can I sue for my wasted time?,"Stay away, far away if you value your times and cash. This book is a complete disaster."
5,Not So Easy,"This book catalogues the way Robert G. Allen made $24,000 on the Internet in 24 hours. This is great if your name is Robert G. Allen, however, I believe that most average people would not be able to experience the same success. Robert G. Allen has a well-known name that people have come to trust.That having been said, the book still contains a lot of useful information for those starting or attempting to expand their Internet business, however, the book was written in 2001, making some of the information obsolete.If you are looking to start your own internet business, this book will provide you with the basics but you may want to find a more current book such as Michael Port's Book Yourself Solid."
3,"A FUN """"YARN"""" TO READ","WOW!!! THAT WAS QUICK!!! WHAT A FAST, FAST BOOK TO READ. ?? 3 DAYS ??ALSO A PRETTY DECENT BOOK. IT WAS FUNNY AT TIMES--SAD AT TIMES.AN AUTHOR MEETS """"B-T-K"""" BEFORE HE RRREEEAAAALLLLLYYY BECOMES """"B-T-K""""AND TAKES US ALL OF THE WAY TO THE END---VERY ENTERTAINING."
3,Interesting read if you have been to some of the places,"This is my second McMurtry book (first was Picture Show). In this book, McMurtry details the life of the outlaw in the southwest, Billy Bone, from the eyes of a bored upper class journalist from the east coast. Though parts of it could be construed as the life of Billy the Kid (especially the other outlaws), this is a different Billy altogether. The parts of the book I really enjoyed had to do with when the outlaws were traveling in Texas, New Mexico (Las Cruces), and south o' the border into Mexico.All in all, I think you'll enjoy this book, but it really is a quick read (and not a difficult read either)."
2,A Waste of Time,This book was a waste of time. Anyone expecting to read another Lonesome Dove will be greatly disappointed.
1,"did this man write ""Lonesome Dove"" ?","I made it to 100 pages, it's absolutely awful. He generates no feelings for these characters at all, they are so wooden and lifeless. Do not waste a dime on this book about dime novels."
2,ANYTHING FOR BILLY,"NOT ONE OF MCMURTY'S BETTER EFFORTS. A THINLY DISGUISED ACCOUNT OF WILLIAM BONNEY (BILLY THE KID). CHARACTERS NOT CREDITABLE OR BELIEVABLE. BEN SIPPY'S FRIENDSHIP WITH BILLY, A COLD-BLOODED KILLER. A SEVEN FOOT BLACK MAN RIDING A CAMEL AND KILLING WITH A SWORD. I DON'T THINK SO!"
2,Pure Disappointment!,"I'll make this nice and quick, I've read many of Larry's books, but this one....oh man where to begin? There is no character you could care anything about, I've read 130 and then threw the book away, I was forcing myself to read this dreadful book. If your looking for something captivating in the likes of Gus and Call, this ain't it. Do yourself a favor and just read the lonesome dove series, this is just trash or a writer meeting his quota."
1,OK if you don't have anything else to read,It has been quite a while since I have read this but as i recall it was not anything to jump up and down about. There a very cool ear pulling scene though .
1,Boring!!!!,This book was really dumb. I did not like it at all. It was just soo sooo boring. I thought it [stunk].
1,Skip this book!,The book is very difficult to follow and the plans for the jigs are quite poor. The prose is often distracting and it feels like this is either the author's first book or he was in an hurry to finish it. The pictures are all black and white and too close to the subject. You really get the sense that the author is more concerned about showing off his jig making skills rather than helping you make your own. I also dislike his blatant plugs for both Porter Cable routers and his offset subbases that he wants to sell you....
5,Masterpiece board game a treasure,I bought the 1970 versions (the original) of this game. My grown children grew up playing this board game and loved it. Years later one of them was at the Chicago Art Museum and was thrilled to see every one of the paintings hanging there.
4,Great for the stereo enthusiast,"This book is composed of two parts, one is a tradtitional hard bound book and the other is a book-like folder that contains the stereographs that are examined in the book along with a brown plastic viewer. The two halves are contained in a slipcase, all of which have similar covering to make a nice looking set.The stereographs are typical litho-style cards reprinted from the original cards but are interesting just the same. The viewer is often broken at the hinge in used copies of this title but any viewer may be used for viewing.The book discusses the history of the stereograph briefly and then goes into an exploration of subject types, each of which has a reprint litho-stereograph included. The depth of coverage is not overly great but the book does contain some nice images and is an interesting history of the subject.I would suggest this title for the stereo enthusiast as an interesting read but not as a reference book."
5,Fun for all ages,"The perfect CD for background or dance music for a TV party. If you have a get together where folks come dressed as their favorite TV characters this is the package that will make it seem right. Imagine ""Theme From Star Trek"" with the steel guitar, banjo and fiddle trading lead riffs. Another standout is ""Pink Panther Theme"" on banjo. ""Batman,"" ""I Love Lucy"" and ""William Tell Overture"" (with horse sounds) are all top notch fun. If you want a special song for an Olympic style skating number or for a dance contest, try one of these. Very imaginative."
3,instructive.,These episodes are informative. I learned a lot. However I did not see the episodes where the officers were taught to pepper spray children and the elderly. Or get a day off with pay for firing their gun (paid vacation). Or use a K-9 unit on those already in custody. Guess I will keep watching.
3,A Solid Effort!,"Chip R. Bell thinks that the future relationship between the managing and the managed will resemble a partnership, and at the core of this partnership will be mentoring. In Managers as Mentors he describes the ideal relationship between mentor and protégé. Unfortunately, Bell's description of the ""magical dance"" of mentoring is perhaps the book's weakest offering, composed mainly of amorphous passages related to things like ""synchronization and synergy."" When Bell narrows his focus to practical advice, however, the book begins to shine. His insights into how to give advice and ask questions, although aimed at the mentor/protégé interaction, will be useful to readers in many other situations. For that reason, we at [...] recommend this book to executives and managers who want to be mentors, any student or professional that might someday be in the market for a mentor, or anyone who wants to pick up some common-sense communication pointers."
2,Not nearly loud enough,OK in a quiet environment but in a car or background noise you cannot hear. It needs two or three more volume clicks. I'm using it on a Blackberry 7100G. The Scala-500 is louder.
5,"Was skeptical about purchasing,but...the 850 IS GREAT!!!","I was very skeptical after reading many bad reviews about the 850, but i still decided to purchase it. It was a little tricky getting my RAZR to recognize the device, but other than that it is great.I read many reviews that said the bass was low and you could not hear, but i beg to differ. The bass is perfect and it can get pretty loud so i have no complaints...it was a great buy."
3,Love/Hate Relationship,"I love the fact that I can flip the boom to turn off the unit, but the volume SUCKS!!! It truly amazes me that Motorola can invest so much into a piece of equipment looking good but consistently fails to provide a product that performs well in the real world. Wouldn't you think that adequate volume control would be important on a earpiece that doesn't fit down into the ear canal?"
1,Great Headset Rendered Useless by a 10 cent Flaw,"When I bought this product, I really only found one flaw that was significant to me, unfortunately it is FATAL. It simply hangs over your ear, but does not have a 10 cent piece of plastic or gel that focuses the sound into you ear canal and shields out background noise. The result is you cannot hear when you are on the freeway. Everything else, style, electronics, stability is all good, but if I cannot hear when I am in my car.....I mean hands free use in my car is 90% of the benefit of Bluetooth. Motorola: Just a little piece of plastic or foam could fix it!"
2,Not as good as others,"I bought this product after washing my last bluetooth headset. I liked the styling and features listed on the page, however when I used the headset, the volume was way too low. I have trouble hearing everyone that calls me, even the really loud ones. Since the whole point of this is to have your hands free and i found myself pushing it to my ear, i am not impressed with this product."
1,Don't buy it,"Reception is very poor. There is lot of background noise. Its hard to hear that well while driving, i cannot hear my music that well. Sound is not that loud. I own this bluetooth for a year now and i hardly use it because of its poor quality. CERTAINTLY DONT RECOMMEND IT."
2,Not that good,"I purchased this item thinking it would be a good product, but it does not work well with my pocket pc. I have a ppc 6700 and I can not hear at all when i'm driving.It is good for when you are inside a building. Volume is not that good."
4,Great quality but WHY the non-standard charger!?!?!,"The quality of this little bluetooth headset is great and the battery life is decent especially for its size, but I wouldn't recommend it because it doesn't use the standard mini-USB charger, and I really don't understand this because the older models do use the standard charger. When on the go I don't want to bring yet another few chargers with me just for the headset. Mini-USB makes a lot of sense because I already have to have the cable for my laptop to connect up the external hard drives, so I can just use that, or I can use the blackberry charger to charge it in the car or outlet since I already have those chargers with me."
3,Hard to hear when driving....,"I pair this headset with a MOTO Q. No issues when pairing the headset and works fine however I wouldn't recommend this headset if you drive a lot and there's a lot of background noise while driving, it's hard to hear; if I can't hear the other person, they can't hear me unless I speak up. In a quiet room, works fine but I mainly purchased this headset for when I'm driving."
1,HS850,WHEN I ORDERED THIS ITEM I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING A USA PRODUCT. INSTEAD I RECIEVED A INTERNATIONAL PRODUCT WITH AN INTERNATIONAL CHARGER AND AN ADAPTOR. NO WHERE ON THE DESCRIPTION DID IT SAY IT WAS AN INTERNATIONAL ITEM. I HAVE ASKED FOR A FULL RFUND AND I'LL NEVER WASTE MY TIME PURCHASING FROM HERE AGAIN!!!!
1,"DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!","Don't buy this lackluster product. Motorola was headed in the right direction until they got here. Object is too large, earpiece hurts and the sound in and out is muddy water at best. Battery life is decent, which is better the the 300/500 series but lacking the power of the 700 series.If you have a choice, don't guy this one. If you don't have a choice and this is all you have...wait until you get to the next store!"
2,Items listed and out of stock,"I request an order for Motorola HS850 Headset, the order was canceled automatically, If is out of stock it shouldnt be listed!"
3,Sound definately needs work,"I had just purchased this headset, after using the HS-805 that amazon provided with me (free of charge due to promotion). The HS 850 audio quality is worse than the ""cheaper"" headset that I have. Although it looks nice, and has better features (boom mic, easy pairing) the HS 805 still beats it sound quality-wise. I am going to return this headset, due to the low volume of the earpiece. I can hardly hear the person on the other end although they tell me that I am coming through crystal clear."
2,defective product,The product arrived on time but was defective. I was unable to pair it with my blackberry or my motorazr. The unit would not shut off even after the boom was closed. I emailed DBroth who asked me to get in touch with customer support in Motorola. There I went through the trouble shooting steps and was advised to return the product.The service was prompt though and refunded my full amount paid.
1,"Doesn't use a USB charger, volume is terrible, charge lasts only about an hour.","Why all manufacturers don't use the standard universal USB charging adapter is beyond me. If you own a Motorola RAZR or other phone that uses USB charging then you will need another charger for this one. Also the earpiece doesnt fit well on your ear, infact i have had it blow off when I rolled down the window. I recommend going to a store and trying a few on before you buy. Plus the volume and reception is terrible. Any ambient noise and you can't hear your call. I also notice it may still have a charge but once it gets low it loses connection with my phone. So the total 'usage' time is about an hour. My advice, keep looking."
2,Motorola and Volume,"I have the RAZR and Motorola headset...Not sure why but the volume on each is way too low.The Scala 500 that I got free with my RAZR has far greater volume.Not complaining about my RAZR, it's an OK phone, plus it was free. But it's not nearly as functional as it is good looking.Anyone else experience selected ring tones mysteriously changing???"
3,Works.. but with delay and echo,My first Bluetooth headset and I was a little disappointed.Pros:Good volumeEasy to useCons:2-3 second delay when I speak (BIG CON)Echo - I can hear what I say after I say itInteresting is that it works better (less of a delay/echo)on my iphone than my blackberry BOLD. Seems the phone makes some difference.
4,Great item to have,This is great to have when driving. It shipped within 4 days of order. I am very pleased with the product
3,motorola Bluetooth headset,"The headset was sent in the correct amount of time. I do use it; however, the baterie charger doesn't connect well to the headset when being recharge."
1,Do not buy this product.,"If you turn up the volume to better hear the person you are calling, the person calling you hears an awful echo. To get rid of the echo you have to turn down the volume to the point where you cannot hear the person you are attempting to talk to. I paid good money for NOTHING. Do not buy.... period. I will never buy a Motorola product as long as I live. Buyer beware."
5,AWESOME PRODUCT!,"THIS IS AN AWESOME PRODUCT, THE MOST POPULAR BLUETOOTH HEADSET ON THE MARKET TODAY!"
2,Not exactly,"Kind of like the car rental commercial.... not exactly whatI was hoping for. Erin cites her own personal effort, whichnobody can deny, for sure, but beyond this life-theory, there'slittle more to this book. A better title would have been:""I should have listened to my father...he was right."" I'dbe really interested in a book on parenting by Mrs. Brockovich'sfather. He seems like a really level headed guy."
3,"She's famous, right?","That's the only reason for this book to be. Having not seen the movie, I can't say I knew much about her story when I picked up the book. After reading the book, I still don't know a lot about it.The account she gives in here of her life and the how eponymous movie was made is kind of interesting. The motivational schpiel that makes up most of the book is kind of gloopy and cliche. But going around and making inspirational speeches is her sideline these days, so it must be working for her."
1,How do you spell phoney,"After glancing at this latest Brockovitch endeavor, again I find myself repulsed. I fail to see the purpose of this book, other than keeping her ego going. I certainly hope that the world would look for advise and motivation from someone of greater character. Truly another piece of garbage inspired by the same."
2,May not be what you think,"I'm not sure I qualify to rate this book since I just sped through it at the bookstore. It's a pretty quick read.I anticipated reading about life through the eyes of famous Erin Brockovich and some keys to success that she applied to her own life. Instead, I found a book that is totally about her and really nothing else. The book is about how SHE could win, and maybe if there's time she'll give you a little advice, but she comes first.I couldn't tell if she was trying to get pity for having to rebuild her house that she paid so much for. (...)?Anyway, $(...) is way too much for a book that isn't going to make you any better of a person. The best thing in it is the quote from Calvin Coolidge. Sorry, Erin, nothing personal."
5,"Great product, nice scent.",The Paraffin wax arrived quickly and in top condition. It makes your hands so soft in such a relaxing way.
5,parafin for hand bath,"In my view, this is a good product. Lightly scented, melts quickly, and applies to hands well. Very satisfied."
5,Love this scent!,Love this peach scent! Mild and not overwhelming and works even with some allergic clients. Bead form melts fast and the texture is creamy and soothing. Will be one of my top picks for paraffin use!
5,great value,This is a professional grade parafin. It comes off your hands easily and has a pleasant scent.
3,A few too many twists but a solid thriller,"Higgins has pretty much mastered this genre and has been known to ""phone a few in, but COLD HARBOUR does a nice job within the confines of Higgins' rather straight forward style. Playing around with the typical conventions of cross channel warfare, identical twins(never a good idea), and a foray into LeCarre territory, a nice thriller emerges. The story does have its flaws with a rather obvious villain and a few too many twists to hold onto the realism that Higgins generally strives for but overall it works its way to its inevitable conclusion effectively. Other than the ridiculous cover on this paperback, as astutuely mentioned by another reviewer-a U-Boat which has nothing to do with this tales of an E-Boat and espionage, this one's a rather nice page turner and not bad for a quick thriller to fill in on the plane trip or at the beach."
4,To Win a War,"Jack Higgins drops the reader into the espionage world of WWII with COLD HARBOUR. The pace is fast and the mission is deadly for all concerned. Craig Osborne who has once been a prisoner of the Gestapo executes a Nazi and escapes back to England with the help of the beautiful Anne-Marie Trevaunce.Anne-Marie is the niece and heir to the Countess Hortense du Voincourt who's chateau has been convenscated by the German high command. Anne-Marie is ordered back to England where she is given a truth serum that goes horribly wrong. Her twin sister Genevieve is recruited to carry out her assignment.Great action and intelligence novel with a rapidly changing plot. Excellent read.Nash Black, SINS OF THE FATHERS."
4,Entertaining Read,One of Higgins' better books. This WWII-based story revolves around the infiltration of a French chateau where a meeting between Rommel and his subordinate generals will take place. The story is full of non-stop action and interesting array of characters. A quick and entertaining read.
3,Not worth it,"I found this book for free and read it based upon the rating of 4 stars that Amazon.com readers had given it at the time. I'm sorry, but it's definitely not worth a 4. Even giving it a 3 is being generous. It's a decent book, but, given all of the other better things out there to read, this book isn't worth your time. The story has some interesting twists. But, for the main, it is contrived, lacks energy, has flat characters, and lousy dialogue."
2,Lightweight Adaptation of What Seems to a Lightweight Story,"David McCallum of ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" fame could not save this story no matter how many voices and accents he tried. The people are uninteresting. I cared not whether they lived or died. The plot twists were pretty much out of the ""Very Big Book of Spy Story Elements"" reference. I've heard it all before, and it wasn't really worth listening to the first time in other stories"
1,ruined my photos,"the UV was okthe CP just left horrible scratches on my final printsstay away, definitely, guys! Buy some Tiffen or Hoya instead, and you wont regret"
4,A Solid Debut,"Urgency is definitely a departure for Ryan Malcolm from his Canadian Idol days and with Low Level flight he actually has the chance to write and perform his own music. The lyrics are solid with the chorus oftentimes being the highlight of a song. The album is pop-rock and has a pleasant mix of slow and fast tempo songs. For example, I picked up the album after hearing ""Change for Me,"" which is very radio friendly and very catchy. ""Turn Around,"" on the other hand, a song about two brothers, is much slower with touching lyrics and a pleasant melody; again, the chorus really shines through.Some songs fade into the background, but it remains an album one can listen to from beginning to end. Urgency is a strong first offering from Low Level Flight and I'm looking forward to hearing more from them."
2,manufactured badly,"I've used these for a few years and they all have a flaw: during manufacture, the rubber is injected into the mold in such a way as to create a twisted knot at a thin part of the ring. If the injection was done a few millimeters in either direction these would last much much longer, but as it is, some of them break after a few washes. Some of them last and I still use them, but I'm not buying more."
3,Did Not Meet Expectations,"Though these items work fairly well for their purpose, they are not as effective as I had hoped. Because they are so flexible, they are difficult to get on and off the socks. The flexibility also causes them to come off in the wash. Although these sock holders are less expensive and will probably last longer than the hard plastic type, they did not meet my expectations."
1,Didn't pan out,"Sounds like a great idea but in practice it fails. Biggest problem I had was with the dryer. Socks never dried around the area which contacts the little rubber thing. Only way to dry them is to remove the rubber thing which defeats the purpose. Don't waste your time or money, I've already done that with mine."
3,good read but i wouldnt read it again!,"plot:jethro has loved alissa the first day they've met and now she needs his help. she needed a husband in order to inherit an estate and thinking that jethro has no money, alissa offered to pay him money in exchange for a husband. what she didnt know, was that jethro is a ruthless millionaire business man. its a good read but like i said, its not something that i wouldnt read twice. it didnt just appeal to me. the hero and heroine doesnt have much chemistry and the plot was kind of weak."
4,A Good Read,I quite liked this book and would recommend it. The Characters are funny and the plot is good.
4,Plenty of humor and fun to read!,"I had a good time reading this story. There were some parts that really tickled ones funny bone and other part were very poignant. I gaurantee there are very few books like this one on the market. Go out and buy it, its worthwhile and hard to put down!"
5,ARGENTO + SUSPIRIA corrected verision,"DUE TO A SYSTEM ERROR THIS IS A CORRECTED REVIEW!! I had obtained a UNCUT bootleg copy of this movie some time a go(dont ask!!)and it was even better than when i first saw it. People today just dont get it. These days attion spans are short, which means low IQ levels!! What im getting at is this movie holds up better than the mindless and boring (bloodless)horror of today. Even though the effects are dated a little bit, they can still make your girlfriend squrim!! Unlike the really fake cgi stuff out there now. Yes the story is a little silly (and i mean a little !!!) and the acting so-so. But its a horror movie!! From overseas!! So just sit back, relax and enjoy a shining star of this genre. Now its finally comming to DVD. I cant wait!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,All hype,"This is one of the most overrated ""horror"" films you'll ever see. I, too, was swayed to check it out after hearing about its ""legendary"" status as one of the greatest ever made. It's just not true. It's unintentionally hilarious in many scenes. About the only positive comments I can offer are for the effective use of extreme color and an interesting soundtrack. Otherwise - a waste of time. Watch ""Dead Alive"", instead."
4,Not the Typical Schlock,"Sure, the dubbing is off but for me it added to the movie. It's a great combination of eery and camp with arguably the most effective soundtrack I've ever heard. Turn out the lights and enjoy!"
2,Kinda Stupid!,"This film was not terrible it just wasn't good. And the plot was convulted to point of absurdity. I mean the end when she killed the old bedridden witch was kinda cool and the upstairs attic floor covered with maggots was original but other than that you had this invisible killer going around slashing up girls, I mean you can at least see Jason or the Candyman but this killer in the movie just seems like the keygrip guy or the studio janitor being called into be that ""deranged but unseen killer dude"" and imitate I guess the evil unseen spirit force of the witches. This movie was and I mean this STUPID!... I tried to like this movie but I just couldn't hang."
2,Rosemary's Baby goes to Satan's (dance) School for Girls ...,"and FLUNKS! I haven't seen acting this bad outside of a porn film. The plot is laughably lifted from many other films and held together by, well, nothing. It's no wonder Jessica Harper has disappeared. And Joan Bennet's performance makes her turn on Dark Shadows look award-worthy. Really!Visually, it's wild to look at ... kind of like a whorehouse in Querelle or a Ken Russell daydream. Otherwise it does not have much going for it. The soundtrack is effectively creepy - but if you have a home theater system, be warned: it is LOUD.And scary ... Not At All. The only frightening thing is the bizarre adoration some people have for this movie.Artsy for those who haven't seen any real art films."
2,YAWN!,"I was fooled by the hype into believing that this was a film every true horror fan should own...don't believe it. This film is more likely to be enjoyed by ""art house"" cinema enthusiasts than your general Horror audience. The movie is shot with unusual colours which are supposed to add to the movies eeriness, but in my opinion, take away any sense of realism. The plot is reasonable but not enough is made of it; rather than having a climatic ending which the film appears be slowly drifting towards you are left somewhat dissapointed by a cheap effect.I would only reccommend this film to those who are interested in artistic visuals or Argento fans. Otherwise I doubt if you'll appreciate it."
2,dubbing is abominable,"This old scare flick is simply not scarry these days. The version I saw was not subtitledand the dubbing was awful--both in Italian as well as English. Sound was uneven.Italian filmmakers seem to think this is acceptable. Well, guess what, folks? It's a headache for theviewer.The writing is as unimpressive as the direction. Argento has done much better elsewhere. Take a lookat that thing he did with Keitel. Harvey is terrific in it--and so is the film (with the exception of the uncalled for, nutty flashback sequence.)Sorry, can't think of the title. Might be called The Black Cat. Not sure. Harvey plays a photographer in it."
5,One of the scariest movies of all time!,"I finally got a DVD copy of Suspiria. I watched this film on VHS in the late 80's and it scared me then. It scares me even more now. Argento's technique squirms into your mind and grabs the subconscious part, filling it with horror. The choice for the films lead was great. A little frail, but a little creepy herself. Jessica Harper invested her character of Susie perfectly with a steady sense of dread and terror, reacting with just the right balance of emotion. Unlike many lead characters in horror films, Susie somehow manages to pull herself together, despite her horrid situation. I absolutely love this film. It is Argento's masterpiece."
5,Must own horror film,"This is one of the best films ever made in the horror genre. I rate it in my top ten films of all time. The film is like a horror film with an opulent base. The colors are beautiful, unlike any other Italian or any countries horror film in history. Argento has a lot of great giallo and horror films, but this to me is his masterpiece. The film is about a young American female that travels to Germany to study at the famous Tanz Academy. She quickly finds out after a slew of brutal murders that the school is a front for a coven of witches. If you are a horror film fan or just like any genre film this one is a viewing necessity. If you enjoy it the film is a first in a trilogy about the three mothers. The second part is titled Inferno and the third is The Mother Of Tears. Happy chills and thrills"
3,Suspiria,"Suspiria is one of my favorite movies of all time. The only reason I am rating this as three stars is due to Blue Undergrounds copy. I don't know what it is, but the first one I received was choppy and would stop playing in the DVD player. I told Amazon and I got another copy about 9 months later. I can't even play the replacement copy in the DVD player. I have to play it in PS2 and when it gets to the part just after they are in Olga's apartment, if I don't skip the next scene, the rest of the film will be completely chopped up and green screen. I would love to get my hands on a good quality copy."
4,"I might be prejudiced, but...","Yes, I am prejudiced. I like the movies of Dario Argento, most them at least, and Suspiria is at the top of the list. The movie is no holds barred and probably shocking to those who have never seen it. The traditional garish colors are there bringing us into his world of horror. The deaths are violent and the movie gave Argento a reputation for being a misogynist. The music is jarring (soundtrack by Goblin).The plot centers around the magical forces threatening an American student Susie Banyon at a school of dance. Mystery piles upon mystery. Curious friends are murdered. In the end, it is up to Susie to challenge and destroy the evil overshadowing the tall, imposing school of dance.The directing is first rate. The plot leads nicely to the conclusion. And Jessica Harper does a wonderful job of not overacting and showing the pluck she will need to overcome the magic."
4,Argento is the King of Italian Horror,"WOW. ""Suspiria,"" undoubtedly one of the truly scary movies ever made (and this is coming from a devoted Horror Movie fan), and also an important artistic moment for the Italian maestro himself. Trying to pick the most unsettling scene in this is like trying to pick the goriest slasher movie of the ""Friday the 13th"" saga (you try it). The blind man and his dog; of course the opening double murder; the room of barb wire...For me, the creepiest scene is the one in which Suzy is walking down the hallway and the cook and little boy just stare (and stare...and stare...) with Goblin's incredibly unsettling score pulsing in the background kept me up for a while. Worth seeing, for sure."
3,"Disturbing and violent, but one of Dario Argento's best.","While this is not a movie that is suitable for all adults, at least those that cannot appreciate graphic Italian horror films, ""Suspiria"" is one of director Dario Argento's best films and my personal favorite.What helps to make this film scary is the loud soundtrack from The Goblins and the dark photography. If you want to see a really good Italian horror film, let Suspiria be the one. Keep in mind that this is an extremely violent film."
4,A HORROR CLASSIC,"Sure there are some weak spots in this, as in all other Argento pics. I encourage all viewers of the recent ""Screamsummerbuffy"" set to sit through this one though. You won't see a visual presentation like this anywhere else. The climax of the opening scene in ""Scream"" is a direct homage to the start of SUSPIRIA. They don't make them like this anymore, Argento included."
5,Possibly the greatest Italian horror movie.,"Suspiria is not only one of the greatest Italian horror movies of all time, but one of the greats of horror, full stop. For years, the British censors cut material from this film which they deemed as being offensive. Fortunately, they have had a change of heart over the past few years and are now allowing movies previously too controversial to now be released. Suspiria is one of them. I won't reveal the scenes which were cut as it might spoil your first time viewing, but if you want to watch some good horror that doesn't have any of the typical 'masked killer stalks good-looking teenager' which dominates the modern horror movies then Suspiria will provide you the frights."
1,"sha,she-sha,she-SHA!!!","extremely boring italian non-horror movie. this movie builds and builds, but nothing ever really happens. The guy who doesn't get it? I'll tell you my friend. This movie rides on the coattails of the ""its so weird and strange, it must be a masterpiece"" logic. There isn't any horror, some gaudy colors, entanglement in barbed-wire, maggots, and Friday the 13th. noises. thats it. there isn't much pay off to watching this film. at no point was I even remotely scared while watching this movie, and like that other guy, I had a really hard time not falling asleep. You want Italian scares? bring on Fulci or the Bavas, or even Cannibal Holocaust for chrissakes! Argento is a hack and a phony. period."
1,So bad it's funny...,"Interesting how Dario Argento is referred to so often as the Italian ""master of horror."" This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Not scary. Not interesting. Horrible dialogue. Barely discernible plot. Only watch if you are curious to see how bad it really is."
1,Avoid this trainwreck ...,Okay I was all hyped up to watch this as soon as i recieved it in the mail and boy was I let down hard. Did the people that reviewed this movie here watch the same one I did ? This movie was terrible from the start! Whats with that... annoying soundtrack? You can't even make out what the fools... are saying half the time! What style filming are the reviewer's talking about also? There is none. Possibly one of the worst horror movie's ever made.
2,"Visually striking, but.....","It obvious that Argento and co. have created a visually and aurally impressive film, however I can't but help feel that other aspects such as characterisation and plot are somewhat limp."
1,Fails on all levels.,"With all due respect, if you think this is ""one of the scariest movies ever made,"" you have not seen nearly enough scary movies. Suspiria is indeed frightening...frighteningly bad. Don't try to find any semblance of a cohesive plot...there is none. Rather, we get a series of badly acted scenes intended to spook us but which merely made me laugh out loud at the ineptitude on screen. Funniest of all, perhaps, was the obviously fake bat and fake dog, which were no doubt purchased at the toy store down the street.A couple of violent scenes do interrupt what seems like hours of plodding, boring exposition. But these death scenes are so amateurish, so badly executed, that you'll laugh yourself silly watching them. Of course, if you like watching endless scenes of people dancing, this is the movie for you.Actually, there is one good part of the film...the closing credits. Finally, this ... has come to an end!"
5,Fairytales from hell,"Dario Argento chose to temporarily leave his giallo roots behind for this halucinatory and supernatural thriller.This is easily one of the best Argento films, spawning a truely chilling and beautiful soundtrack, cowriten with the infamous band Goblin.This films relies heavily on atmosphere and Arento never fails to deliver beautifuly dark sets and halucinatory colors. This film is truely a work of art and would set a standard for future Italian film makers.With one of the most ruthless and chilling murder scenes that I have ever wittnesed, this film is truely in a class of its own.Some tips about this particular DVD- I would actually recommend getting the three disc set rather than this one and also the daemonia music video is extremely cheesy and is not worth your time of day, unless you want to see a bunch goofy looking metal heads attempting to look evil and vampirical while churning out Goblin's theme."
5,SUSPIRIA---One of the best films I've seen,"Dario Argento, the genius behind DEEP RED, wrote and directed this terrifying horror tale of an American dance student who finds thrills and chills at a German ballet school. This film was scary, suspenseful, beautifully directed and acted. I can watch it over and over. Definilty worth the 95 minutes. Cheers to Dario!"
2,disappointed,the 2 stars are for the soundtrack I have been waiting eagerly for this DVD to hear it in DTS surround. Even up on volume 15 the music is struggling to get thru. It sounds so very suppressed. The music on the soundtrack is better. I remember seeing this movie 24 yrs ago and the music was deafening in the theatre.Apart from that the picture quality is excellent with vibrant color. Shame about the sound
3,not the terrifying experience I was expecting,"Well, I finally got up the nerve to watch ""Suspiria"" and I was a little underwhelmed. I thought that it had a great sense of menace and I thought the music was effective. Perhaps I might have enjoyed it more had I watched it alone (my friend hated it) but I'm not sure. I have to admit that I did find the extreme use of red color a little too much and I did find the music, although effective, to be too loud and redundant. Maybe that was the point, but I think the overuse of the music made it lose its impact. I thought the opening murder was very scary, but I don't think that the gore had anything to do with that. I found the extreme gore distracting rather than scary. The ending with the directress was very effective (I loved the freaky girl with the knife, that was scary) but when it was over I wasn't scared to turn out the light and go to bed. I'll see it again sometime, but it wasn't the heartstopping masterpiece I was expecting."
5,Simply the best,In my opinion this is the finest horror film of all time. I love all of Dario Argento's films but this is my favorite. The murder scene early in the film has never been topped. This has the most original and intense soundtrack you will ever hear. You need to turn this up LOUD. I love to go down to my basement and put this on with all the lights out and the movie cranked up. I can scare the crap out of myself and it's GREAT. I know a lot of people are put off with foreign films because of the dubbing but I cannot imagine anyone who is into horror movies not loving this.
1,WASTE OF TIME,"Perhaps my dim view of this movie is because I cannot seem to get hold of Argento movies. In any case this one gets boring instead of better. After a dynamite murder scene early on, the ensuing scenes are far too dark and the music extremely loud. I will bore the reader no further as my title for this review speaks clearly enough."
2,The kind of movie you outgrow,"I loved this movie when I was a kid, but I saw it again just recently and I couldn't believe how silly and tasteless it was! Sure, it's well directed... but give me a break."
1,Horribly dubbed dialogue ruins flick,This DVD does not offer subtitles and instead has the dialogue dubbed. This is also the case with the Opera dvd. I returned both. I watched it with a group of people and we all agreed it ruined the viewing experience. ...
1,no english subtitles - no sale,"I would buy this film if it was in its original language - that is, Italian - with (hopefully, optional) subtitles - in English to start. Since it does not, I won't buy this version of the film. Does anybody want to watch a dubbed movie anymore...?"
1,not the masterpeice its praised to be....,"i bought susperia thinking it would be a masterpeice like everyone said....i was WRONG.the only good thing about this movie were the kills.the story was ok,the plot kinda boring and it took FOREVER to get to the good parts.NOTHING scary about this movie at all so i dont understand all the good reveiws.See the third movie,mother of tears,its a better movie to me and moves at a better pace then this one.i havent seen the sequel,inferno,but after seeing this one i never will."
2,Horror's version of Lost in Translation,"Suspiria may be one of the most polarizing films in the horror genre. Like the movie Lost in Translation, people seem to either love it or hate it (I hated Lost in Translation as well). Many fans of Suspiria will claim those who hate it just aren't smart enough to get the movie. Those who despise Suspiria wonder what flavor of Kool-Aid the fans have been drinking. I won't rehash the plot since it's been summarized over many reviews, but I do think the film is worth watching (but only once). The first death sequence is quite shocking and the music is one of the most haunting horror scores I've ever heard."
2,This was dumb.,"That's a few hours of my life I won't get back, but I'm sure it was good for the time it was made."
3,A disappointment after the build up of this movie,"I thought this movie was a big letdown after I had read so many reviews on it. I went out and bought it about the the The Ring came out. I bought both of these movies because they were both built up to be these real scary movies, but I did not see that. Suspiria was really a bore and I did not even find very much suspense in it."
2,dissapointing DTS,I was so looking forward to hearing this in DTS but alas the soundtrack seems to be pushed right in the background. The soundtrack in all formats on this DVD seem very suppressed. The sound on my old worn VHS tape version is 100% better....
3,"Stylish and superbly edited, but it's hardly great.","Strange events are occurring at a German dance school and new American student Jessica Harper suspects they have something to do with the teachers. Dario Argento's proclaimed masterpiece leaves me feeling indifferent. Stylish, atmospheric, with a memorable score by Goblin, but ultimately, there's very little story, which becomes a major hindrance when the bloody murders and the suspenseful build-up to them aren't present. Acting's subpar, too, but it seems a bit frivolous to mention that. Only recommended to horror fans seeking a stylish, but not particularly frightening affair."
3,I could take it or leave it.,"I consider myself an avid horror fan. I like the classics- TCM, Hills Have Eyes, Re-Animator, anything Romero... And I'll give any horror movie a shot. I had heard only good things about Suspiria, so naturally I was excited to add it to my collection. In hindsight, I could have done without buying it. It is worth watching, but may be better suited as a mid-week Blockbuster selection. It is a standard Argento flick, with obvious nuances of Italian cinema. Some implied scenes, some gore. Acting is OK, audio quality at times was questionable. Plot moved along on the slow side. I would say it avoids a lot of the typical horror ""campiness"" until the end. The finale just made me chuckle and made my girlfriend roll her eyes. Overall, I could take it or leave it."
3,Its alright,"While shopping for horror dvds, my favorite store had a sale on a bunch of movies. I picked this one up and it sounded like a great film. The movie starts off in a rain storm and in a creepy home. Then a murder which Entertainment Weekly called the most vicious murder scene ever filmed. Ive seen alot of films and I didnt think it was vicious. Then the movie kinda of drags on from there. It has a good atmosphere but never really delivers the goods. It was alright but I probably never will watch it again."
5,What a Masterpiece!,"Even after all those years, since I saw the movie the first time, I still had the same amount of chills and the excitement while I watched it over and over again. It is one of the best suspense/horror type of movies I have ever seen. The colors, the decors, the special effects, and the performers are incredible. ENJOY!"
1,Style over substance...,"is an understatement! A boring plot line, tiresome special effects (which, by the way, DO NOT stand the test of time), and poor lighting throughout make this a movie I would line up to miss. The only redeeming scene is the fall through a stained glass window, which is the only death in this movie that is worth watching in this ... attempt at the horror genre."
1,What a disappointment!,"Wow this movie just plain sucked! I bought this movie because of all the great reviews on it saying it was a must see and you haven't seen horror until you've watched this movie, etc. Were these people drunk or high or something? It was a very slow, boring start & middle. I imagine the end was too but I was so bored I fell asleep. My BF thought it was horrible too and was so glad I nodded off so he could turn it off. Do not buy this movie if you care about actual HORROR. This is not scary and the only horrifying thing about it is how horrifyingly horrible it is! Not worth $5 if you ask me."
2,What the fuzz is about?,"Does all of you wrote good reviews to not regret your purchase? What a dumb director! I have seen all Argentos movies and any of them has the merit to be a good film.Don't get me wrong: As an artist and 3 years in cinema studies I have About 200 horror DVDs in my collection and love 80% of them.Yes the colors, lightning blah blah blah but Booooring! Sloww pace and actors dance, and speak, and walk and speak and go on... Mr Argento has forgotten something: A movie is to be seen not to be told! It's not a book it's a movie... There is just about 15 minutes in the whole thing that it worth seeing and each of these minutes are really great and that's why my 2 stars are for. Prepare a pillow for over an hour."
1,"I gave it 1 star, only because zero was not available.","Absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Read all the reviews about how great and scary the movie was and considered buying it based on them alone (but rented it first to make sure). Well, I am still kicking myself 2 days later for wasting 2 hours to watch it. Gory? Scary? How about embarassing and ridiculous. Acting was dreadful, plot was horrible, and I caught myself wanting to turn it off 30 minutes into it. One of the best horror movies? The horror is that I actually spent money to rent it. This movie does not even come close to horror classics such as The Exorcist or Halloween. Toss this one in the category bin of: outgoing garbage."
2,what am i missing?!,"I must be missing something, i bought this movie... when i watched it i fell asleep, its boring as hell trust me im a true horror fan and a gore-fiend, this movie was NOTHING, the only gore was when this guy cut some lady in the heart and it looked so fake.... the ONLY scary part was the end with this witch, is everyone high but me? this movie sucked! boring as hell.. 2 stars!"
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Argento's skill lies in visuals, not storytelling, and that's never been more apparent than in Suspiria: the film's characters all talk like 8 year-olds (Argento wrote the script for younger characters and never changed it) and there's no real mystery whatsoever."
3,"Good, but slow",The murder scene in the beginning of this movie is the highlight. Other than that the movie drags. The imagery is pretty cool too. If you are sensitive to bad acting I wouldn't get it either. But then horror films are not known for great acting.
5,Probably the Greatest European Horror Movie,"From its astonishing opening sequence, this is a film that grips and bewitches in equal measure. The director's masterful use of the widescreen ratio balances foreground events with the whispered conversations that create the atmosphere of intense and disturbing conspiracy that sustains the momentum to the end. In between, the celebrated set pieces cannot fail to shock and amaze a first-time viewer, but it is the more subtle effects that will keep you coming back for repeated viewings.Thank God for the DVD format, where the colours are properly balanced and you don't have to put up with the panned and scanned travesty that use to exist on tape. It's just a shame that there are another few minutes of film in existence: cuts from a Dario Argento film are always a disappointment."
4,"Confusing, But Definately Scary","I don't know what I expected from this film...I've seen one Argento film before this, and I must have forgotten that the most important thing in his films is not plot but style. The music is intensely creepy, the lighting is enough to drive you nuts, and several of the scenes made me jump. Not to mention that I'll never forget some of the scenes as long as I live (raining maggots, anyone?) In other words, the film is effective and very impressive--who needs a solid plot anyway?"
2,Are you guys kidding me?,"Sometimes the public is right and the critics are wrong. Sometimes the critics are right and the public is wrong. Sometimes they're both right but in the case of ""Suspiria"" they're both wrong. This is the most over-rated horror movie ever. Only the first and last 12 minutes of this movie are worth seeing. Everything in the middle is just bland. A few inane death scenes here, some over the top music there and lots of senseless chatter. The story should've explored witchcraft more thoroughly and made more use of it."
2,Suspiria,"I was very disappointed after viewing this dvd. It had been given a high rating and touted as one of the scariest horror movies of all times--this is not true. The only scary part of this movie is the opening murder. It pretty much goes down hill after that. I've seen worse horror movies, but I was so disappointed with this one because there were so many great reviews on it. I've seen many, many horror movies and this one is at the bottom of my list. The sets and use of color in the movie are beautiful, but it does not make it any scarier."
2,"It's different, and worth a look, but...","when it's all said and done, I felt like I COULD'VE done something else. It's the kind of movie that I don't regret watching, but really have a small need to see very often, but may want to in about 10 years. The first attack was the best. The rest of them were noticeable to kinda silly. It has a good use of sound, color, and atmosphere, and recommended for viewing, but not more than the initial time, which took 3 viewings before I was able to reach the end. Worthy of credit, but a high level of acclaim is not what I would bestow to this title. Maybe I just saw it too late in my life(2001 vs. early 80s)."
2,Hmmm... I didn't like it.,"One thing this film is well known for is the visuals and the score. Not so much for th plot. The acting and dubbing was, in my opinion, ok at best. Rent before buying. I myself found this movie to be rather boring and slow. I can see why it was classic over 30 years ago. The visuals and the score(which in my opinion tended to be a bit repetitive) are rather unique. What was eerie and scary 30 years ago may not be for many in this day and age. Some people seem to still like this film but I mostly found it boring."
2,"Not God Awful, just not good.","I agree with the people who said the movie was shot well, and the soundtrack is creepy....the transfer to dvd was very well done. I'm trying to be positive but that's about all the good I can say about this movie. I tried to like it, I really did.....but....no. Masterpiece?? Try Romero. Maybe I just didn't get it..."
1,"If ever there was a turkey of a film, this is it","Dario Argento definately hit an all time low with this overlong excursion into the absurd and ludicrous. Jessica Harper is a ballet student from New York who is attending the German Dance Academy run by Joan Bennet and a Naziest dance instuctor. The story is convoluted and filled with holes and the music score is the most annoying in film history. The acting here is not even amaturish, it is just plain awful. On the box of the video, it states 'the only thing more terrifying than the last 5 minutes of this film are the first 90!', it should of stated, 'the only thing more ridiculous than the last 5 minutes of this film is the entire film itself. I cannot begin to trash this film enough, it is that bad. Stay away from this movie!!!"
4,Interesting film,"One of Argento's better films along with Phenomena and Inferno. Not for squemish though, some of it literally makes your hair stand up on end :)"
2,SHOCKING!!!,"I had wanted to see this movie forever, none of the local video stores carried it. The reviews and Bravo's reccommendations made me sure I would love this. I did not. The color and sets were amazing. The story and acting were not. There were many plot holes and things that didn't make sense. I understand why some people would like this, but there are many horror film buffs that find this out of place in cannon, and I 'm one of them."
4,What One Doesn't Realize About Argento's Filmmaking....,"****1/2Half A Star Taken Off For Lack Of Subs And A Brief CutAs much as i'm disappointed about the lack of subtitles, everyone seems to forget or be ignorant of a production fact about Itallian Horror and most noteablely Argento Films. EVERYTHING in an Argento film (with the excpetion of Trauma and sections of Phenomena) is dubbed! They film the scene first (without recording audio) and then dub in the diogloue later. This is especially evident in Lucio Fulci's Zombie where the English track seems to favor the Male and Female lead and the professor, while the itallian track seems to fit the supporting cast better. But as much as i would have liked Subs for this film, the Itallian track is a dub as well. Given this fact, it's up to you which you prefer, I personally like Itallian tracks, though Planet Of The Vampires just...i don't know it got on my nerves, something seemed really off about that Itallian."
5,It's a shame I can't give this movie 6 stars...,"Turn the lights off, put this movie on and beware of the witches. There are many things to say about this movie, but I guess that the previous reviews pretty much sum everything up. Just buy it and enjoy one of the best horror films ever!"
5,Top class horror!!,"One of the best horror movies I ever watched. The background score is amazing and very original. The 2-disc special edition rocks. It comes in a regular keep case. Disc one has the movie in widescreen format with DTS ES 6.1 audio, trailers, Music video etc. Disc two has cast & crew interviews. This is one worthy purchase for any horror movie fan."
4,Suspiria--Thrilling and Visually Stunning!,"Suspiria was made a long time ago, in film terms, anyway. Yet it still seems modern, despite being very stylized. This film is unmistakably European and decidedly scary. The story goes something like this: A naive and innocent American girl gets sent to a deadly, decadent, and wicked European dance school (in Germany, no less); soon all hell breaks loose and our American ballerina is fighting for her life; I agree with another viewer that the heavily synthesized score really under'scored' the stylized horror of the film. You may be wondering about my use of the word style, but once you've seen the film you're sure to agree after seeing just a few minutes of its eerie sets and haunting music. It's like a truly terrifying haunted house at the fair; and those have never frightened me. Or maybe it's because I was really really stoned when I saw this movie. That tends to heighten the excitement.Cheers!"
4,Weird and doesn't entirely make sense but still good fun,"The buzz on Italian horror might have really kicked in with Suspiria. After seeing Fulci and Lenzi movies I was really apprehensive with Argento. I was pleasantly surprised to see the difference in quality, camerawork, pacing, editing, character development, etc. It's tough to understand the first time through, and the killings don't look terribly effective (especially the throat-slitting scene) but for the above-mentioned kudos, it's worth sitting through and learning to really enjoy. The soundtrack is probably the biggest plus, and the opening killings are a real doozy (though the heart should be gushing blood when it's stabbed). Good induction to Eurohorror; here's hoping Argento can finish his Trilogy (Suspiria, Inferno, and the next yet-to-be-named witch movie)."
2,Too much hype,"I started this movie in the hope that it would be one of the scariest I have ever seen. I was sadly disapointed! The first kill seen was good but then the middle of the movie was slow and boring. It had a ""Rosemary's Baby"" feel to it. This would not even rank in the top 20 of scary movies I have seen. If you are looking for a scary movie don't choose this one. If you are looking for a ok movie with a good story this might be what you are looking for. I think the problem was I did a lot of reading on this movie and got caught up in all the hype of the movie."
2,This is not a good movie.,"I'm sorry, But when I rented this i exspected this to be great and it isn't nearly good. The acting is fine., the colors and the atmosphere are neat, but the story wasn't very engaging. In fact it seemed stupid and the ending was really cut short and wasn't good either. This film doesn't hold a candle to Rosematy's baby, halloween, or Carrie. Sorry, but not even close."
2,Over hyped,"Visually the film is quite good. The plot however is quite thin and the acting pretty unexciting. The music had an uncanny tendency to annoy. The plot has little going on, the film could have been shot in 30 mins as a short film and would probably have worked better for it!I can't honestly see why this film gets the rave reviews it does, belive me there are a lot better films of this type out there. Again this film gets a mention as a cult film frequently, but just why it falls into that classification is again a mystery, as mysterious as Argento's use of red, green and blue lighting.If this is Argento's ""masterpeice"" I'm afraid I won't be trying any others."
2,"Unusual, Artistic, Creepy.....and very boring","Having read a number of reviews saying that Susperia was a true horror masterpiece, I just had to experience it for myself. What I found was definetely different from any horror film I had ever seen.Susperia is not filmed in a typical western style. The soundtrack is overwhelmingly loud, the visuals are bright and overly colorful and the gore is graphic. Despite all that, the story is filled with plot holes, jammed together and mostly non-sensical.Don't get me wrong. I get why its a classic of a sort but its not my cup of tea. If you have never seen it before and are new to the way Italian Cinema is shot, you may have a hard time not turning it off."
2,Slow moving and ugly.,"I first read about this movie saying it was one of the best horror films ever and then a good friend of mine,Rich, told me he had it and I watched it. What a dumb film.The story is about an American dance student who attends a European ballet school only to find it is a witches coven. As with all Argnto's films there is a good deal of unneeded blood and graphic scene's to keep you woundering why the hell you are watching this. The story developes very slowly so by the climax you really have lost intrest and you watch it to see what happens almost out of obligation.Over rated and dim witted this film leaves a bad taste and an even worse memory."
1,Horror(ible),"I bought this movie based on all the great reviews here at Amazon. I brought it to my brother's house for a bunch of us to watch. I told him that critics claimed ""One of the scariest movies of all time"" and ""One of the most terrifying murders ever filmed"". I will never live that down. What on earth were you people watching? This movie is not scary or suspenseful. The acting is terrible. The special effects are horrible (even for the decade it was made). I spent more time laughing at how bad this movie is than feeling any interest in what happened. If Amazon allowed it, I give this film minus stars. This film is 98 minutes of your life you will never get back."
2,Who said this was scary?,"Plain and simple -- I bought this DVD because every review raves about its atmospheric, frightening presence on screen.This movie is NOT scary. It's stupid. The plot is dumb, the acting poor, and the ending is so weak I sat stunned in my chair. Way too much dialogue, red herrings throughout the film, and rock music that adds NOTHING to the overall feel of the film.I admit the camera work is artistic, but that's the only good thing I can say about this over-rated, simple film.If it was that good, it would hold a better place in film history.P.S. Blood isn't orange..it's crimson. Fake, fake, fake. Don't buy this DVD..rent it first.Scary to me is disturbing social matter and evil. This film doesn't even come close."
4,Suspiria - Thrills & Chills from the Master,"Suspiria is a visually stunning piece which is well worth viewing. Dario Argento was on a roll when he did this film (some may remember Dawn of the Dead, Creepers & Inferno). I particularly like the blue, green and red hues which give the film a gothic/nightmarish vision and lots of atmosphere. Some spectacular/unusual murder sequences(reminiscent of The Omen) and definitely not for the squeamish.Also, a creepy ghoulish cast of characters helps to build tension and incoherence. Some references to alchemy and the occult make it black magical!!I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it for horror fans. Watch it in the dark for maximum effect!!"
3,Classic For It's Time,"Colorful Psychedelic Romp of midnight masses and mystery murder! This would be fun for the girls to watch on Halloween Sleepover. Entertaining dialogue with good casting of characters. Eeerie, yes though not really scary. Try ""The Legend of Hell House"" for a good scare from this era or""Eternal"" for colorful unique sets and film locations with a good scare about the blood drinking countess, Elisabeth Bathory."
2,far from the scariest!,"i gave this film two stars only because of its stylized camera shots,and the use of the creepy music was a good choice but it all leads up to a bunch of nothing.one over the top bloody death at the begining and a dog that turns on its owner by tearing at it's neck.only to conclude with the killing of a witch that snores real scary and is invisible!!!this is not the scariest movie ever.i think it just might be the worst however."
1,Reviews are lies,"I had read so much about this movie, it was called one of the scarriest movie of all time...please. This was awful. I love the Italian horror movie genre even though they are cheesy, but this movie was not at all scary. The plot was lousy, the special effects awful. Aviod this movie..."
2,Boo-Ring,This flick is completely lost on me. Lugubrious plotting with an ocassional shocking scene to enliven the proceedings. Even these scenes that were meant to shock are tedious and amateurish. I'd give this flick one star but it was too boring for me to truly hate.
1,Poor unrealised film,Has classic problem of a filmmaker who thinks in still images not motion. Great picture ideas somehow try to come to life as motion but hardly do. Weak story lacking flow and complexity. A classic example of a boring B- - movie but made in Europe so it is supposed to be brilliant but is a bore. See Jean Cocteau's Orpheus 1950 to get the real effect of a slow but great Euro movie.
2,Title is misleading....,For a true network professional this title is very misleading. The first half of this book is made for people who have very little knowledge or understanding of computer networks
2,Disappointing for a Beginner!,"If you're an experienced Paint Shop Pro user, this might be a good reference book. But as a novice, I found the book to be confusing, just a collection of Paint Shop Pro facts and procedures. It would have been nice to have some examples, where an image is edited from start to finish, step by step. Also, I couldn't help but notice that the authors did not give an address or email address where they could be contacted with questions, comments, errors in the book, etc. I have put this book back on the shelf and I'm using the manual that came with Paint Shop Pro."
4,not for the total beginner,"Good book if you have a bit of hands on with this program. I would not say it is a good book for the total beginner...some of the examples are a bit hard to follow. It is a REFERENCE book not a insparational book. You should have some idea of what you want to do. It is organized in logical sections and subjects were easy to find. Even with the programs manual, this is a good book to have handy. I think it should have been spiral bound to lay flat tho, I hate having to set something on it to keep it flat while I work. The book is not in color but there are center pages that have color examples. Yes I would buy it again if I lost it."
3,Good Cheat Sheet,Well written for what it is. If you're trying to understand graphics concepts - buy another book. It tells you what commands/buttons to click on without explaining why. Severly lacking in discussion of subjects. More like a 300 page cheat sheet!
4,Great Desktop Reference,"If you are tired of lamer beginner books and have no time for the $60 master in-depth reference books then this title is for you. In plain terms and with plenty of photos and examples, it guides you through PSP 5.0's features one by one. Recommended highly, well worth the money."
1,"Not for beginner, not a reference book.","I found this book very confusing. It is the worst book I have ever had. I don't know for whom this book was written, who would find it useful? I can give just one star for this book, because at least it has text and pictures. Don't spend your money, you will find user's guide for this program more useful and for free."
1,A Most Curious Failure,"Perhaps the most perplexing failure of a movie I've ever suffered because the movie's plot is highly compelling but the execution--cold characters, confusing shots, absence of tone and soul--result in an empty melodrama. Never have I been so removed from characters in a story as noble as this one. The consequence was great irritation and befuddlement."
1,Would have worked better as a stage play,"I just felt bored. I was looking for a promising story about the american gold rush - and so I got to this film. I really love movies and I must say that watching this movie just was a waste of time. Nothing really works. The story could have been of some interest. But neither the director nor the really poor cast could transform the drama into the necessary dimension. There is not one character you care about. Well, there is a lot of just white landscape. You can do not much with that setting concerning outdoor shots. But if the camerawork would have been a bit more inventing, the whole thing could have been more interesting. I don't think that static shots have to underline stagnation in the character development. It might be that the movie works better in a theater, but for home entertainment on DVD it offers nothing of inerest. The sound design works well, but that's it."
1,Thomas Hardy? Not even Oliver Hardy!,"After two hours of watching it, I still don't know what it was about. Yes, the scenery is fantastic, but a National Geographic film would have done more.I applaud the acting of Milla Jovovich, and Nastassja Kinski. But, the kudos reviewers have given to Peter Mullen would have been better deserved if this were a silent movie. I hardly heard anything he said and there are no English subtitles offered on the dvd. As for Wes Bentley, that's acting? He kept the same expression when he was having sex as when he was having a gun pointed at him, or a co-worker being blown to ""Kingdom Come"" (that's a pun based on the movie). He makes Clint Eastwood look like Laurence Olivier.The film is supposedly based on a Thomas Hardy book, but very loosely based, and the scriptwriters should have at least used Cliff Notes to have learned more about the story and the character development. They obviously fell asleep after the first couple of chapters and made up the rest."
2,Epic (n): 2+ hr. movie with no attention to characterization,"Thankfully, it's only 2 hours (as opposed to typical epic movie durations). When will Hollywood and movie critics realize that a movie isn't very satisfying if it has only one dimentional characters? No amount of scenery or historical reference will change that. I bought this video because of the positive reviews on the cover: ""One of the top 10 films of the year""--Chicago Sun Times, ""Two Thumbs Up""--Ebert and Roeper, and ""One of the years best films!""--Jeffery Lyons. It's interesting to note that Hollywood has been in a decline since film historian/critics began to frequent the airwaves with their own shows (which, btw, are produced by the same corporations that make the movies). Oh well, I should've known better than to listen to the praise of predicable critics. Overall, I give the movie 2 stars (the scenery and the actresses were pretty), 0 stars for the reviews. Buyer beware!"
1,"Confusing, boring mess that never goes anywhere","This is a bloated pompous mess of a movie that looks really good and wants to be good, but cannot be. The editing is mostly to blame. It jumps around from time period to time period without much warning and then there are the events in the movie that make little sense. For example, why does a fully furnished house moved into place by men and horses, not have broken dishes, crockery, paintings on the floor, etc.? Instead everything is perfect when the actors step inside. And why is a train circa 1930's running around in 1900 California? And how on God's green Earth could someone be buried six feet under when there is a good two feet of snow on the ground (anyone who lives in a snowbound area knows this is impossible)? Wes Bentley isn't so much acting as just saying lines. The one thing this movie had in its favor is that none of the actors had straight teeth - and that would be fitting for the era..."
2,"Nice idea, terrible execution...",I had at least decent hopes for this film considering Milla Jovovich is in it. I love her albums and her singing in this movie is wonderful. Unfortunately her performance can't even help the lackluster performances of the other actors and the lack of atmosphere in the movie. This was a great idea but just so poorly executed. I was so bored I couldn't even finish watching it. The plot has some interesting twists and turns and I think that had there been some changes in the cast and the director this could have been a great film.
3,Good but could have been much more.,"Good acting, good story, wonderful scenery - however, could have been so much more. Don't know what the problem was - suspect it was the editing, but the movie seemed disconnected at times and hard to follow. Another part of the problem was the difficulty in understanding the conversations. Whoever was in charge of sound made a mess of it. Someone took the good story, exceptional photograpy, good acting, and screwed it up. In spite of the mess it still deserves a 3."
5,The Rhyming Season is a Winner!,"I am an eleven year old boy and I think that""The Rhyming Season"" by Edward Averett is a great book! Brenda Jacobsen (the main character) lives in a small town named Hemlock with her tall, basketball loving family. I liked the way the author made all of the characters in this small town become so real and believable. Even though I am a boy and not yet in high school, I could relate to the challenges that Brenda was going through in the story and was totally absorbed by the basketball games and action packed plot. I like this book because of the way the author combines two very different things together, basketball and poetry."
1,NEVER BUY FROM THEM,"As previous reviewr, I also got wrong size shoes and the refund was only $3.49. The shoes length on the label was 24cm, while it real length was only 22cm. This seller should be prosecuted for fraud."
1,Don't bother,"Damn, these shoes are so tight. It doesn't even fit me. I wear a size 7 on every pair of shoes that I bought and they're usually a bit loose so I can move around easily. This sizing must have came from Japan or something cos it ain't U.S.A size. A 7 is more like a size 5.5 so don't bother buying this shoes. Its nothing special. The only thing about it is its cheap but since it doesn't fit you, no point of getting it at all unless u don't mind throwing away $10 + shipping and the shipping for me costs more than the shoe itself. Buyers be warned!!"
2,Sizing is wrong,"I ordered a 1/2 size bigger than my normal size and the shoes are too tight and very uncomfortable. I am going to try to sell them on Craig's List since it looks like there would not be much of a refund if I return them to the company!!The shoes are cute but if you want to buy them, I would say get a whole size or even a size and a half larger than you normally would."
5,Great!,I'm very pleased with these sneakers. They are sleek and fit well. They are very lightweight and will be good for outdoor terrain. The spikes are easily removed for indoor use. They are ventilated so that your feet don't overheat. The order was shipped in good time and the package arrived in excellent shape.
4,God be praised for the Ladies,"The Girls Won't Leave the Boys Alone is one of the loveliest, liveliest, and pleasurable discs that I own. I knew the Ladies could play--but this disc also shows what wonderful singers they are.I'm not usually one for recordings that I call ""guest-fests."" Yet the Ladies have picked such great partners (John McCutcheon, the Clancy Brothers and Arlo Guthrie among them) on this CD that I am most impressed.Beyond its excellence, you just get the sense that this music was a blast to play. This is artistry and music done at its best--in community and friendship.The songs are all great. There is not a weak link to be found. My personal favorite is the version of The Mad Puck Goat. Also of special note are Rambling Irish Man (with its excellent grouping of artists) and the absolutely haunting Down by the Glenside.I give this disc my wholehearted recommendation."
5,Wonderful,I have played this over and over and over. It is so infectuous and fun that I find myself singing from it at work! Great.
2,False Advertising,"Disregard the advertising that says this album is by Cherish the Ladies; it isn't. First, you have to understand that in this kind of music there is a terrible double standard: Female singers are expected to sound angelic while male singers are expected to have spent the last twenty years conditioning their voices by gargling with drain opener. The album is more of medical interest than musical interest. It displays many of the various ways the male vocal chords can be damaged by gargling with drain cleaner. The closest analogy I can think of is: Imagine a CD ""by Judy Collins"" 80 percent of which is actually the singing of American ex-president Bill Clinton."
3,Could Have Been Designed Better,"This life vest helps protect a small child, but the child can still roll face down into the water and drown. We found that putting inflatable water wings on our twins while they wear the life vest gave them better protection. Of course, we never leave a child unsupervised in the water either way. The strap on the life vest that goes between the legs has a tendency to chafe and irritate tender skin. That should have been made with padding or softer material."
5,Little swimmer,This is a great lifejacket. The sides are full and it has three buckles so it fits snug around the upper chest. This is slightly shorter than other lifejackets that are the 30 to 50 pound size so fits my girls really well.
1,Don't buy unless you can determine the cultivar,"Dutch Elm Disease is the cause of the massive reduction in the number of American Elms in the United States. There are over 40 cultivars, or sub-species, of this elm; the ONLY types verified to show resistance to Dutch Elm disease (DED) are the cultivars Valley Forge, Jefferson, Princeton, and New Harmony, with American Liberty being currently disputed as a Dutch Elm resistant strain. The seller here does NOT tell you which cultivar this is. Great, so you get 33 out of 40 of your seeds to germinate. How many will live to be 10 years old once planted if they are not a resistant strain and get DED?"
2,"Okay, but...","This book wasn't as helpful to me as the ones by Steven Strauss and the Cahers. She does offer some very practical money management tips, but the bulk of her really helpful information can be found on the web or in more professionally written guides."
1,Not worth the money,"While this book does have some good ideas, it's not worth the money. (and as mentioned in the review above, it has some bad ideas, like the $200 car. You'd probably go back into debt when the car breaks down on the highway & you have to call roadaide assistance) The author is an average consumer, so I guess I shouldn't have expected all that much. The list of secured credit cards can be found by surfing the net. The writing & editing is incredibly poor with exclamation points !! used all over the texts. I plan to serach for a book written by a professional accountant or tax attorney."
3,Bought $200 Car she advise!,"I filed for bankruptcy and got 3 cards right after discharge with about $3000 credit which I used to go to school for 3 months in IT field, got job after that as Computer Professional went from making $6.00 an hour to $17.00 an hour, paid off cards and right now just have one which I owe only $400, only problem was I bought $200 car she advised and ended up paying $1600 in repairs ( of course got rid off car also)"
3,Not enough story telling,"While the information collected gives the reader a wealth of facts, I was looking for the stories and story telling Barnhart can weave. Fans love to engage in arguing about great teams and great players while sitting around the living room. This reads more like a dry text book covering southern football."
5,"Excellent product, terminator for HP's no power cradle","Very excellent product works very well with my ipaq 1935, and wokrs as both USB syn cable and battery charger. After I got this, I regreted deeply that I bought a HP cradle from OfficeDepot two months before this, which has no USB power supply function.I strongly recommended this to any ipaq 1935 users."
1,An AAA Guidebook Disappointment,"I have traveled the 50 USA states many times over and have always used AAA Tourbooks. They are my bibles! Their format is perfect with much information. Cities and sights in alphabetical order in the first half of the book and the second half gives all the information on lodging and dining. THIS SCOTLAND GUIDEBOOK IS PRETTY AWFUL!. They have not used the same guidelines as in the USA Tourbooks. This format is difficult - not well coordinated AND lacks much information!. I have a trip to Scotland mapped out- Some big cities and some villages. I found only about a half of the locations in my itinerary. Looks like I'll stick to the ""Lonely Planet Guide"" Still the best!"
4,"Great book, way ahead of the game","""A Piano for Mrs. Cimino"" is a fascinating book. Author Robert Oliphant tackles dementia (in 1980!) giving an early-on description of Alzheimer's before we really knew what it was. ""A Piano"" will broaden your perspective on this horrible disease. Incidentally, I purchased this long-ago printed book through Amazon and received it within a couple days."
4,Pretty good,this figure is ok and its much better than expoloding body grievous!!!! and 1 thing i hate about this figure that the cape keeps falling off and its the 2nd best grievous figure and four saber attack grievous is the 1st best.
1,this is not what is advertized,"this is a nice looking 7.5 foot garland, but its not lit with LEDs, its just simple white lights found on most common trees and garlands, I returned ours as soon as it came in when I found it was mislabled."
1,Waste of Time,"This was the first of Mr. Matthiessen's works that I've read, and based on ""Lost Man's River"" it will be the last. A tale that might have been told in 100 pages -- if at all -- is dragged out far too long. The timelines are confusing, and verifiably inconsistent; the characters are unappealing to the last and completely predictable; and the story itself goes nowhere. You're told all you need to know on page 1 and the rest is overblown description and repetition. Obviously, I regret taking the time to read this book and can only recommend that other readers try something -- anything -- else."
3,a let down after Killing Mr. Watson,"Perhaps I loved Killing Mr. Watson TOO much. I was thrilled to see a sequel, but found the characters in this novel pale in comparison to the outlaw watson. These folks which we met superficiously in the 1st novel, well, maybe I got to know them too well in this one! Or maybe Mr. Matthiessen has a different point to make about these outlaws and outcasts. Hmmm, can't say it'll stop me from anxiously awaiting the third book in this trilogy!"
2,Until now I thought I was a patient reader.,"I've read only the first 135 pages of this novel, but feel compelled to publish my critique less I die of boredom (or old age) before I finish it. Perhaps my exhaustion comes from the fact that I've had to reread every other sentence to have any idea what's going on. Despite a beautiful cover, this book is a web of tedious geniology almost completely void of anything close to a plot. If I live long enough to finish it, I'm afraid the experience to date will still be enough to leave me dissapointed."
2,The Mangrove Novel,"Living in southwest Florida in the area of much of the locale of this story I was constantly reminded of the tangle of the mangrove forests which are typical of the coastal waters of this part of the world and the Ten Thousand Islands in particular. Virtually impenetrable. So was the confusing mass of cracker family detail piled on the reader. One has to force one's way through it and the result is a pretty thin story at the end. However the author's tidbits of history about the area and the spoilation of the Everglades is of interest for those having some knowledge of and curiosity about the subjects. I also felt that this New York born writer carries a lot of his Yankee baggage with him which causes him to unload the usual northern liberal unsympathetic, vulgar, racist stereotyping of southern life of the past on the readers. Way overdone."
4,"Picks up where Mr. Watson left off, and goes way beyond","Matthieson has one of the most unique and evocative writing styles, and for a person who grew up in NYC, his ability to write in the voices of denizens of the everglades is amazing. It gets a little slow at certain points, as some of the same ground is gone over many times - but once you finish, you realize that this repetitiveness is exactly what the main character's obsession with his father's death would lead too: he just can't let go; he needs to keep at it, no matter the cost. And what a cost. Overall, I loved it. I can't wait for the last installment of the triology."
3,The great mass of familial documentation was overwhelming.,"I am an avid fan of Peter Matthiessen, and eagerly anticipated ""Lost Man's River"". After reading 150 to 200 pages, I began to wonder what he was getting at with the monumental absorbtion in the trivia of names, relationships, and memories. As I progressed further, waiting fruitlessly for either some fuller character development or an essential story line to take shape, my disappoinment began to mount. By the time I finished, I am saddened to report that I felt cheated. The encyplopedic attention to detail required to give full attention to the book, does not fulfill it's end, nor is the final surprise a justifiable finale to the mind boggling littany of detail to which we are exposed. Hopefully, the final volume of the trilogy will restore the interest so greatly initiated by ""Killing Mr. Watson""."
2,An effort to sell books leads author to incorrect timeline,"After waiting eagerly for the second saga of life in the Everglades, I was disappointed with an inaccurate time line, malicious use of real people 's names with bad events at the wrong time and place in The Everglades history.... a portrayal of good and simple people as rednecks, crooks and drug runners. The story line is stretch to its limit with the main figure in the story having sex with a college student when he had to be in his 60-70s... This is not equal to the first book - don't waste your time"
3,I was hoping for more...,"I loved the first 3 cd's from Delta Moon and looked forward to this release. However, it appears they dumped their female singer, which I felt gave a nice harmonic to their songs before. Additionally, the material doesn't feel as strong as their previous releases. Good cd, but missing a lot from before."
1,not worth the money,"i bought this from belkin for over $500 several years ago...it had a problem of loosing the onscreen menu and i sent it back for a replacement.....the replacement did the same thing....i called the belkin tech support and they didn't demonstrate a very practical knowledge about the switch, so i knew i was on my own.......the 16 port swich that i use will not accept a laser mouse, so i am stuck using a rollerball mouse...i have tried many brands of laser mice but none will work thru the switch. the onscreen menu is useless and crude. lately, i have had unexplaned lockups of the switch selections and i have no way to troublesoot this....belkin is a better company than this switch represents......shame on belkin for not giving this product the support it requires.....it is not worth the money."
2,Confusing not helpful for me,I found the book very confusing. The endless diplay of routing tables became very boring it seemed most of the pages are filled with routing tables. As far as a book that is supposed to help prepare for a test this was the worst one I have ever read and I am presently a CCNA CNE and MCSE so I have taken many tests.Also one of the reviews mentioned a cdrom with the book that must be a mistake as I am looking at the book now and there is no cdrom with it.
5,Great Warm Socks,"I first learned of ""military"" type boot socks some odd years ago when I had a summer internship in Alaska. I'd been using boot socks since for cold weather and also too to fill in fashion boots where my feet slide a little inside. These boots socks are great; they keep my feet warm, and I love it that they don't cause my feet to sweat (that has happened before with some low quality socks that I've worn). A great buy for keeping feet warm during cold weather."
1,"basic, simplified version of a billion other personality tests","Not only have I read this book, I have also seen Virginia Dunstone present her theories in person. The personality test she uses puts people into boxes and explains away why people act in ways that hurt other people without giving enough ideas of how to ""bridge"" to other personalities. Her presentation was energetic and maybe suited for women in prison who've made poor choices in their lives, but for a group of educated women with their lives in order, it was totally draining and a waste of an entire day."
5,Has yet to get the honor he deseerves,James D Train Williams is a superb vocalist//I haven't heard anyone come close to his vocal soul in years//He's up there with the likes of Stevie Wonder//Kool & The GANG//He is simply excellent//It's so good to know you have his music available to purchase//thank-you///Signed///#1 FAN
3,Brother's Keeper,"The guitar riffs smack you right where it counts. Young Rich Robinson has earned a spot on my list of favorite guitarists. The arrangements are well written and produced. The problem I have is that Rich is a sub-par vocalist...to the point of deterring from potentially great tracks. He'd have been wise to use a guest vocalist on much of this disc. Multi layering and lush harmonies do help, but not enough."
2,"GREAT GUITAR, TERRIBLE SINGING.","Rich Robinson may be a great guitar player (though i always thought Marc Ford better) but as a lead singer he sinks! His vocals are flat and so irritatinly weak that what could of been a great rock album grates on your nerves by mid way through. Great riffs, a little too much overkill (three minutes per track would of been preferable) abound, but by the end you get the feeling that with brother Chris on vocals this would had made a great Black Crowes album. Shame!"
3,"Over-intellectual, pedantic","Karl Kirchwey's poems have very little to do with the real world, with no remarkable immediacy whatsoever. These are poems of a brain without a body, arcane, sifting through history, tenuous.Reading these poems, one is not awed, or moved by the awesome immediacy of language, or even inspired. It is work, like panning for gold, to find bits of language which aren't weighted down with demonstrations of irrelevant pedegogical flotsam.Why do poets insist on being *difficult* in order to have a worthy 'career' in academia? Here's another example of a poseur, striving to be well known, producing over-intellectual linguistic balderdash instead of honest, penetrating, insightful, direct vision. I suppose they loved him at Yale."
3,Nicholas Blair becomes impatient,"Anxious to implement his evil plans, warlock Nicholas Blair summons the spirits of the dead bodies used to create Adam, discovers the man-made creation's hiding place, and befriends him.Disguised as Cassandra Collins, Angelique hopes to return the vampire curse to Barnabas Collins by killing Adam. Nicholas drains Angelique of her supernatural powers and warns her she'll die unless she convinces Barnabas to forgive her."
4,Time Travel is Useful But Not Practical,"As the name suggests, this deals with time travel, sort of. PDK leaves it up in the air as to whether time travel is truly possible by suggesting that perhaps other time streams would be other parallel universes. Toss into this a bit of Xenophobia, marital strife and the drive of personal responsibility and you have a lot going on in 230 pages.I am reading all the PDK novels, one a month. I am 10 months in to this three year trek. It seems, after 10 books, that PKD has an adjustment period. In the first few books I read he annoyed me. Now I'm into a groove.One note, it's interesting to see the concepts in this book played out in the longer and different works by other writers like Orson Scott Card. There's more than a smidgeon of this in the Ender series."
5,Even more beautiful in person...,"Do not judge this piece of jewlery by its poorly detailed photo because when I received it was so much more than I expected! The silver is very shiny and the amber gemstone is beautiful, and even adjusts it color by light and becomes a gorgeus honey-gold colour and looks great when you are out in the sunlight, especially if you wearing clothing of similar tones. So, this pendant is worth appreciating!"
4,How many years ....,"... since ""Open All Night"" (actually their second album)! Nighthawks is one of best bar bands ever, but it was not easy to replace Jimmy Thackery, who quit in 1986. More recently, also Jan Zukowski left. Paul Bell and Johnny Castle are not beginners and provide very solid fret work; as a result this ""Blue Moon in your eye"" is Nighthawks' best effort in years. Owing to the mix of rock'n'roll/blues/rock songs, there are a few weak moments - a constant feature throughout Nighthawks' life - which may disappoint blues ""hardliners"", though slow blues are terrific. Great singing and drumming from Pete Ragusa."
5,The best thing out of classical studies in a long time,"This is about the best book I have ever read about classical antiquity. Davidson focusses on consumption habits, and the morality of eating, drinking, and sex. It is both very revealing about the lives of the Greeks, and an absolutely key step in understanding the origins of modern styles of consumer culture. This is by far the most theoretically sophisticated thing written about consumption in prehistory - Davidson brings some of the best of modern consumption theory to bear, but never in a pedantic way. The text remains lively, fun, and enlightening."
3,"try it, you'll like it...","Any book on a scholarly subject that can manage to be completely readable and even amusing has my complete support, especially if it also manages to be fairly well-researched. Davidson's book can't be faulted just because he (and I'm sure it was him, and not his publishers) skews things here and there to snare the interests of the non-specialist reader. Let's face it: without working that extra little bit with that aim in mind, books on classical history are doomed to a much smaller audience than they deserve."
5,"Fascinating, hilarious, and witty!","""Courtesans and Fishcakes"" is without a doubt thecleverest and most entertaining bit of writing on classical Athens Ihave ever come across. Davidson combs the classical authors (many of whom had seemed drained of life by other scholars) and finds remarkable and startling things about the ancients' love of wine, sex, and, not least, fish. Recommended! END"
2,Hard to read,"Although the topics of this book are appealing, I found it hard to read. It assumes a level of knowledge about Greek society, culture, and language that I simply don't have. There is no clear narrative line to it. However, it did succeed in making me realize how different the physical and conceptual world of the Greeks was from our own world and from our ideas of the what the past was like, and for that it was interesting and worthwhile."
3,a different approach,"Very interesting modernist look at the eating, drinking, and sexual habits of the citizens of this great civilization. They were in many ways a quite peculiar people, not always totally rational, but I still found their overall acceptable standards to be within their own original concept of the golden mean. Some aspects of the book are repetitive, and the author's blasè style is a bit ambiguous at times."
1,Out With the Old and... Where's the New?,"This CD has NO NEW MUSIC. The Depeche mode Covers can be found on Trancemode Express, and the Kraftwerk Covers can be found on Trancewerk. And, since I am not a Kraftewerk fan, and since I have all three volumes of Trancemode, I found this tribute a complete waste of time. Unless you like both Depeche Mode, and Kraftwerk (and trance music), and don't have those other CDs, don't waste your time."
4,Entertaining Middle School Aged Book,"This is a very cute book for middle school aged children. It reminds me of similar stories and movies such as ""Bugs Life"" and ""Ants"" where bugs take on human characteristics. A love story and war story in one. The Lady bug is captured to hope her secret love the Beetle (who also loves the lady bug) will come save her. A story of staying strong and helping others is a perfect theme for this story. A must read for children. Also uses words such as monarch and paradox that will keep a child challenged. Excellent quick read!"
4,"pretty nice, plenty of space for the computer and other stuff","I have only had this for a few weeks now but largely I cannot complain. It appears to be made well, the laptop fits in the sleeve snugly. The only complaint is that there are several pockets on the outside where a newspaper or umbrella could fit into, much as one finds on backpacks but there are no restraining straps to keep them from falling out. This would be a problem when biking as I plan to do."
5,this bag is really great...,"i wasnt sure what to expect when i ordered this bag, but it really is fantastic.i am never in need of a pocket i don't have, and it keeps my macBook dry even in the roughest portland rain."
5,much ado about nothing sharon,"Much Ado About Nothing is a book that deals with deception, love, and friendship. In this book the men just arrive back from fighting Don Pedro's brother Don John. Claudio and Hero are going to be married in a week. Don John does not like Claudio and he plans to break Claudio and Hero up. Don John tells Claudio Hero has been unfaithful to him and to see for himself. At midnight Don John, Claudio, and Don Pedro go to Hero's window and they see Hero cheating. The people at the window is Margaret and Borachio. Claudio believes it's Hero and at their wedding Claudio embaress's Hero. Hero faints the friar, Beatrice and Benedick do to. They pretend Hero's dead until they can prove Hero is innocent. Everyone tries to make Beatrice and Benedick hook up. I enjoyed this book it was an exciting, and adventurous book."
4,A Witty Comedy,"Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best playwrights of all time. This comedy of his is full of plots of mistaken identity and misunderstandings, which are all corrected with a comic flair. The witty verbal war between the characters make this an outstanding example of Shakespeare's command over the English language. I have given it 4 stars, however, because of certain plot inconsistencies, that I feel could have been fixed."
1,Never came. No response from Best Price Mirror,"The product never came. I contacted Best Price Mirror twice through Amazon, giving them plenty of time to respond, and they never did. Currently filing a claim."
2,TOO MUCH HIGHLIGHTING!!!!!!,"I expected there might be some annotating and/or accenting, including highliters, but this is full of it. So distracting. I'm finding that I can't use it."
3,Sit and be Fit DVD,"This is an update to her VHS tape of earlier years. We feel the tape is better for us than the DVD. However, we will use both. We wish we could get the tape version on DVD."
1,Big Let Down,"I purchased this as I thought it was a great deal. However, after receiving it I realized that these same exercises are offered for free on TV. No one's fault but my own for not researching it better."
5,Sit and Be Fit,The video was great. I am 72 years old and think that it was great. I like the way it was presented and I could follow it.
2,not motivational,less than what I expected..not motivational...needed uplifting momentuem. Poor quality I plan to sell and not use for my clients
3,Sit and Be Fit,This is quite different than the other video I bought. The instructor is a bit different in her approach and I guess you would have to get used to her.
3,Not the best of............,"I agree with the previous reviewer - if not to the point of a five star rating - that this is the best available, even if it does replace those hits we know with those irritating remixes. The 1995 Euro CD ""I Can't Stand The Rain"", released on Ariola Express, is the CD to buy. All original recordings, including excellent b-sides such as ""Left Me In The Rain"". That CD truly is ""gold"" for fans of the much underrated Precious Wilson. This ""Gold"" collection is tarnished, to say the least."
1,i want my money back,What book was everyone else reading? The book i read by this title and author is a stupid racist collection of foolishness that has nothing to do real vodun. If the title had you thinking that this book gets into necromancy or voodoo your wrong. Don't buy this foolishness.It fooled me but don't let it fool you. It is really just a collection of racist stories.
5,WOW Zombies everywhere!,well if you plan to buy this great book i must tell you not to use the life drain or poison strike spells cause i tryed it & the poison like a little *light* & only makes your enemie a little green :P but do try the animate dead spell its great go to a grave yard & try it you will have dead walking about in no time :D
3,Brazilian Mix,overall is a good music sample with a few crips and catchy tunes. Some tunes are just plain dull. Perhaps it would be better received by native. Recommended if you are looking for the exotic!
2,tiny,Make sure you pay attention to the size instead of the picture. These are very tiny and returning them requires a 15% fee as well as shipping.
3,"Product fine, beware postage","Sadly Shiseido no longer seem to manufacture this fine eyeliner pen (if anyone from Shiseido reads this - please can you start again as this is a brilliant product), & mine had run out of eyeliner so I was looking for a refill.Found this supplier in US via Amazon & refills were a good price - Brilliant!What is not so brilliant is that you can't order more than 3 refills at a time and the postage & shipping cost is truly extortionate. In fact, once shipping & postage was added to my order each refill cost almost the same as a brand new complete eyeliner!!This is a great shame as the refills arrived in good time and were exactly what I wanted"
1,extremely hard to use,"I bought this speed eyeline because i wanted to draw an eye line 'FAST AND QUICK"".however, this eyeliner is the worst eyeliner I've ever had. It's difficult to even push the liquid out and the pen is dry most of the time. Thus, I have to push the top of the pen very very hard and waste a lot of time. sometimes I am so angry with the user-unfriendly pen that I throw it to the wall. It is definitely the most terrible eyeliner I've bought. super regret!"
5,LOVE THIS!,"If you want the perfect eye liner every time, buy this! You get the gorgeous little lick of eyeliner, or you can easily go wider for a more dramatic effect. It is foolproof and it never fades or creases or cracks. I can't say enough good things about it..it is worth every penny!"
4,How the famous british commandos started,"This is the second of three books about the Commandos ( which were created by order of Winston Churchill) according to the author. They were made up of volunteers only and his descriptiion of their training, and their actions are brilliantly written. The famous invasion at Dieppe cost them dearly as the Canadians had 65% casualties.The commandos went inland to destroy German cannon on that raid after climbing barbed wire covered cliffs.Uncommon bravery was common.A good read.The third and final book is soon to be published."
4,Pop-Epicureanism,"A very interesting introduction to Epicurean philosophy, which is all about explaining free will and if free will actually exists. Definitely a quick read (short) and also easy to read (he tries and succeeds to keep things simple).One little thing keeps me from giving this book 5 stars. He mainly uses scientific examples and metaphors to make his points, which is unfortunate because the reader may not see the practical (and political) applications of epicurean philosophy. I don't want to string this out, but look into anarchism if you are intrigued by the social implications of epicureanism. I can't really find a book that goes well with this one, but I would suggest Crimethinc'sDays of War, Nights of Love : Crimethink For Beginners."
2,Very disappointing work from a good author,"I expected to enjoy this book but just couldn't. Scott Adams is a smart man, witty and clever, but this book was just frustrating in its very weak logic and its ignorance of bread-and-butter philosophical ideas found elsewhere. I normally enjoy a good new-age thought experiment but this one was just too hastily conceived, too from-the-hip to be given any weight. I feel like I have wasted my time."
2,Huh?,"Because God is all powerful & all knowing, the characters in Scott Adams' dialogue believe that self destruction would be His only challenge. Having taking up that challenge & having blown Himself up, God has been reduced to His own debris. We are part of God's dust, which (according to the characters) is now on a mission to reassemble itself (for another round of self-destruction?).Outside of some pretentious smart alecks with whom I went to high school 35 years ago, I don't know of anyone who could take this book's basic premise seriously! I guess the not-so-subtle inference is that anyone else's theology makes just as much (or as little) sense.If Adams is trying (in a very convoluted way) to make the point that the only reason for believing anything should be that it is true, I wholeheartedly agree! With that in mind, I suggest that theCompendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Churchand theHandbook of Christian Apologeticsmake far superior investments."
3,God's Debris,"Scott Adams' thought experiment was well thought out. In retrospect I say it was a good book, although it annoyed me at points during the reading. Being that it is such a small book it can sometimes be an overload of information all at once. The first half is a little slow and seems to just stretch one subject to the max, but towards the end it gets really fascinating to hear his veiw on why things are the way they are. I'm really glad I read it, and I think anyone looking to get a different opinion on life, science, theories, etc. would definately enjoy this book. :)"
3,Decent Read,"This book is a decent read, but it was very... Philosophy 101. It had a few good points, certainly, but overall, I was not impressed.That being said, it is definitely worth reading once."
2,yawn,"Adams says he wants this to be a thought experiment, but for anybody with even rudimentary knowledge in a hard science, math, or philosophy, the majority of ideas presented in this book will be either obviously false or trite. I'm not quite sure why Adams thought it'd be fun to tease out what he says that's reasonable from what he says that's unreasonable, but it isn't fun. It's boring. Worse yet, anybody who has considered these same issues has probably already discovered a better system. I guess if you're really desperate for an unchallenging philosophy book to read, then read this one. If you want something with novel, reasonable philosophical views, read something else. And please, whatever you do, don't buy this book - it's online for free all over the place."
2,mind mush,"I was very eager to read this book. I love books that challenge me, books that question and make us think and re-think our relationships with God, the universe and our fellow man. This is not that book. It is all just fancy footwork pretending to be insightful and important. You want to be challanged? Skip this book and read...well, just about anything else! (Note to Mr. Adams: I don't think my age is a factor here. I am only 43.)"
2,Give it to friends and watch the hilarity ensue,"After buying the hardcopy version of this book and reading it, I downloaded the free PDF version and sent it to several friends and acquaintances. Their reactions say all you need to know about the book itself. The recipients who I can categorise as religious and spiritual, ranging from Christian fundamentalists to New Age energy-healers, found ""God's Debris"" incredibly profound and enlightening. Those who I'd categorise as sceptics and rational thinkers found it ridiculously flawed, silly, and downright ignorant. What category are you in?"
2,Probability is life?,"Interesting, challenging, amusing because it's a short, contemporary read. I'd have preferred to have borrowed rather than purchased it; it isn't something that will have a lasting place on my bookshelf. ""Life's a probability"" sums up part of it. But, it has value in challenging a modern reader to ask themselves why they see the world and life the way they do; do we really believe what we say. The product, I'd guess, of a deep cynic. About an hour to read - and by the way, if you thought ""Who Moved My Cheese"" was a great book you want to recommend to friends, you'll hate this."
5,Endless Opportunities,"A great book for anyone who enjoyed A Brief History of Time, Dancing Wu Li Masters, and Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, in spite of not understanding much of any of them. An even better book for those who talk about those books without having read them.A book that makes people think is rare, and a book that gets them to try to think together is a gem. The magical way everyone identifies with Adams's cartoons works in this book to make everyone want to participate in the experiment. This book is like a great meal - one hundred times better if shared with your friends."
5,WOW!,"This book was absolutely wonderful- perhaps one of the best I've ever read. I read it in 1.5 hours and was up another hour just thinking about the ideas presented by the older, wiser character. I have already loaned the book to my roommate and have someone else in line for it. If you have an hour or so, and you are not afraid to think outside your current belief system for a little bit, this is an awesome book!"
1,Scott Adams showcases his self-infatuation,"After buying and reading this book with high expectations based on the reviews here and those that I read, I am shocked that Scott Adams would even think to say that the 'philosophy' in this book would make anyone's head spin around. It's just a silly book. It wasn't challenging, there were no really new ideas expressed in it. It was a thorough, resounding disappointment. Scott Adams really should stick to what he's good at - Dilbert. Additionally - I was absolutely nonplussed at the audacity of the reviews that were put on the jacket cover. They weren't attributed to anyone, and after having read the book, I'm convinced he wrote them himself or his mom and dad and wife wrote them."
3,Experiment - it is,"Scott Adams is one of my favorite authors and the daily dilbert is something I enjoy. Probably it is because one expects Scott's books to be funny that God's Debris sort of falls sideways away from expectations and it ends up being just what it promises to be - an experiment. Mind you, it is not a failed experiment because the book manages to hold the reader with a plot that is extremely simple and exceedingly magnetic. It is a book that one should spend time pondering over, but one gets tempted to hurry through and finish it in one reading.All in all, a good coffee table book but not a serious read."
5,Philosophy from Scott Adams,"It is hard to believe that this book is from the same author as all of the Dilbert books, but it is. Adams lays out in 132 pages a completely new philosophy of life, love, religion and values to live by. I found the book to be interesting and thought provoking. I read it in one sitting. I suggest that you read it, also."
5,A New train of thought for me,"Before reading I had personally stepped onto some the points in this book by my own thinking. The excellent explanation of the Universe, why we exist, and the point of our lives are all wonderfully tied together into an understandable thought process. No sooner was I finished it when I told a friend about it and she immediately wanted to borrow it. I recommend this to anyone who enjoy's exploring problems and presenting theories."
1,Philisophy for dummies,"This book really surprised me. I like Scott Adams, and always assumed he was intelligent, but for him to release this childish nonsense as something which will make your brain spin... I'm going to have to revise my opinion of him.Everything in this book is obvious, dumb philosophy. It's the kind of stuff you'll find amazing if you've never read a book in your life, or dare I say it, if you have a double digit IQ.I'm quite saddened so many people rated this book highly. I guess it just shows how poor the US education system is.Total waste of time, and totally devoid of any intelligent thought."
2,piece of crap,"I'm a huge fan of Dilbert and Scott Adams, but this book is a piece of crap. Scott Adams is trying to be slightly philosophical but he is also being lazy, and after reading this really short book you dont really feel like it made you think. If you want real thinking books, I would recommend Sartre, Nietzsche or almost any other philosopher. You could even just stick with the Dilbert books, since those are brilliant and are what Scott Adams does best."
2,"Weak arguments, full of Hubris","Adams uses typical arguments meant to disarm traditional theists. Too bad the arguments are weak and tired. By the way, the only person who can say that all the roads lead up to the top of the mtn is the person who sees and knows all roads. I don't know anyone truly that arrogant who believes he knows all religious systems, especially since there have been thousands of them! Beyond the thought experiment there is little to commend here. It might be best if Mr. Adams were to stick to his comics."
4,What others are saying,"I have read over half this book now and must say it's very good. I am upset about some of the negative reviews. It seems to me they open the book to a random page read that page and wrote their review. One person complained about how probability was perceived. If this person would have read on, the book was saying the same thing he was. A lot of people are saying this book in nonsense that should not be followed. Scott Adams says in the preface that this is only to give your mind something to think about and not to be taken seriously. Too many people are thinking Adams was trying to be the founder of a new religion with this book. That's not what this book is about. He wasn't trying to answer any questions about life. I would recommend this book to any one who likes to think about those unanswerable questions, and paradoxes.Also I you did not already know this is not a humor book. It has nothing to do with Dilbert."
3,"It's not Life, the Universe and Everything...","But it does make an attempt.I agree with those who've said the writing is sub-par and the knowledge is pretty general, but overall it's an interesting way to kill a few hours.In regards to the negative reviews, I believe you are looking to deep into this book. It set out to do invoke thought, not drop some grand revelation onto society.In fact in some ways this book accomplished its goals as evident in the good and bad reviews it recieved.If you're reading this book hoping to discover the secrets of life, the universe and everything forget it. However, the ideas proposed in God's Debris are no more unlikely than the ideologies that have spawned humanity to kill one another over a sandy piece of land that may have once held some minor significance a long, long time ago.On a side note for those who enjoyed this read, I might also suggest a book written by Galacticomm CEO Tim Stryker called Common Sense."
2,Witty dialogue and blah philosophy...,"""So you agree that it would be impossible for God to know the future and grant humans free will?""This is the question that begins the journey into pedantic philosophy 101 - which the old man at any rate must have doodled more than taken notes.This is the first in a series of premises which neglect simple common sense answers such as ""God is outside of time, and thus sees the choices you made freely because he is there and here now and back then, all at once.He confuses the feeling of love with the essence of love (willing the good of another) and then tries to push this confusion onto God to prove that He infact cannot be/feel love.The initial dialogue is mildly witty, but overall nothing I couldn't get from just reading Dilbert. Mr. Adams should keep his day job."
1,An excellent book...,"...for college freshmen who haven't yet attended their first Philosophy 101 class. This book is tedious, uninteresting, and serves primarily as a good example of sophistry. It would be helpful if Adams knew the difference between 'omnipotent' and 'omniscient.' At least you can download it for free from the Dilbert website and only waste your time, not your money. Not recommended."
1,Title is Half-Right,"... His Mr. Avatar begins an encounter with the narrator/delivery guy by asking run-of-the-mill skeptic's questions relating to the ""big questions"" of God, religion, the universe, physics, et al. He then forsakes this position throughout the rest of the story, offering ""answers"" that are even less logical and plausible than the ones he originally questions. The book's dust jacket says it was written to make ""your brain spin around inside your head."" That could definitely happen -- if your brain is small enough."
1,Philosophical Pablum,"If you're the type of person who likes to debate the question,""Which came first, the chicken or the egg?"" then this book is for you. And if you ever deliver a package to an old man who asks, ""Did you deliver the package, or did the package deliver you?"", tell him ""neither"" and get the heck out of there."
1,Naive and ill-informed,"I don't know where people get the idea from that this will improve your critical thinking skills. It is both logically and factually flawed in many places (particularly when he proclaims on evolution). It's no defense to say that any such misinformation is deliberate, that's just a cop-out. Of course the fanboys will maintain that I just don't get it :).I know it's a thought experiment. It just a bad one."
3,Interesting -- And mostly in a good way,"God's Debris is interesting. And I think that this was the author's intent really. The book asks a lot of questions, makes the reader ask more and answers none of them. In fact, by the end I am not any more convinced or sure of anything before I read the book except that all those questions I had about whether God existed -- and if so in what form and for what purpose -- are the same ones we all ask. We all have to ask. Whether we believe or not, no matter what our definition of God, the questioning is an important part of faith. It is what you believe after the question that matters.That said I would recommend the book. But don't think that because it is tiny that you can wiz through it. God's Debris requires and deserves your careful attention--and an open mind.Meghan WierConfessions of an Introvert: The Shy Girl's Guide to Career, Networking and Getting the Most Out of Life"
1,Don't quit your day job,Well I guess I'll have to be contrary because I didn't get anything out of this book. It appeared to be disjointed ramblings with no central theme. I love Dilbert though.
2,"If you like De Niro, stay away.","I bought this DVD right after I watched RONIN, and Heat. I am also a fun of Billy and love comedies. This movie is not funny at all except for a few scenes. Kudrow should not be in this movie, she made the average-quality film below-average. Billy did so-so job, but De Niro does not seem to be serious to act here. They could add French track so that I could get at least some advantage from this. I just started to learn French."
1,1 star is too much,"Ok I get it, it was supposed to be funny. But in reality it wasn't. A mafia man who cries all the time? Then slaps people? Come on! This was so bad, I am still mad I rented this trash."
2,"""The Sopranos"" it ain't by a longshot!","""Analize This"" was a big hit based upon a great concept and a couple of yuks. And that's about all this film has. The theme is somewhat similar to ""The Sopranos"" with the big time gangster seeing a psychiatrist. But any five minutes of ""The Sopranos"" has more wit and imagination than this entire movie. Robert DiNiro does a good job playing his stereotypical gangster role for laughs, and he does manage a few. Billy Crystal, on the other hand, is yet again playing the same character he plays in just about every movie he's in. That wouldn't be so bad if the script didn't completely take plausibility for a ride. ""The Sopranos"" is so good (and funny) because it seems so real. ""Analyze This,"" especially the horrendously unbelievable and unfunny climax, scene rings so hollow and so false that it becomes nearly unwatchable for any true fan of gangster movies. Bottom line, if you are a gangster buff, fughettaboutit!"
2,Overhyped,"After reading all of the good reviews this movie received I made the mistake of purchasing it. I love DeNiro but this movie was just ridiculous; I just couldn't buy into DeNiro as a mob boss with panic attacks. Instead of being funny, the movie comes off as completely ridiculous. Crystal is horrible as a psychiatrist and really kills the movie. Overall, just another movie that has its moments but is not nearly as funny as it should be."
2,Analyzing This Bad Movie,"You know, real mobsters don't even swear as much as the fictional one's in ""Analyze This"" do. Profanity in the movie is taken to a new level. You'll hear four-letter words in this movie in people's vocabulary more than a, and and the. The swearing is so terrible that it makes the movie just sick and almost impossible to watch.There are a few very funny parts: when Paul Vitti(Bobby De Niro) cries when he sees a tv commercial about life insurance; when Vitti offers his psychotherapist(Billy Crystal) action from one of his mermaids; when Lisa Kudrow mocks Bobby De Niro with a voice that makes you think: that was funnier than anything she ever said on friends; and when another mobster points a gun at a cow for standing too close to his car. Those limited funny parts give me a reason to give it 2 stars."
1,Awful,One of the worst movies ever produced. Billy Crystal and Robert DiNiro embarrassed themselves by acting in this flick. Not funny. Not interesting. Indecipherable plot.
3,small vocabulary,"This was a really funny show with a good plot line, but the vulgarity was unbelievable. I realize that some of it was for comedy, but it really does get pretty bad. If it hadn't been for the constant string of f words it would've been more enjoyable."
5,"Ready?, Set?, Laugh!!!","Well, here's De Niro, (who can pull anything and everything off), teamed up with Billy Cristal,(who is so great in comedy movies), in a hilariously funny mob ordeal. The way Cristal's character Ben Sobel(a psychiatrist) keeps trying to avoid treating De Nero's character Paul Vitti(a fearred mob boss)goes beyond words and is one of the things that makes this movie be as funny as it is. The facial expresions De Nero makes are priceless. We also have Chazz Palminteri and Lisa Kudrow adding their own special touches of comedy to round the whole thing off.This movie will definitely have you rolling on the floor, and even more so towards the end. TWO THUMBS UP FOR ""ANALIZE THIS""!"
4,Crystal and DeNiro??,"Being a ""shrink in training"" and an Italian American, I enjoyed this movie very much. It was nonstop laughs, even thru some very serious and violent scenes. The unlikely pair of Crystal and DeNiro works suprisingly well in this offbeat and very humorous portrayal of the mobster psyche."
3,"Not bad, not great...","Just your average comedy here, nothing that will change the face of cinema. Its good for some laughs, it was particularly amusing to see DeNiro crying like a baby and telling his doctor (Crystal) that he couldn't get it up. The plot was at least watchable, though I was let down by the ending. All in all it's ok, doubt I'd watch it more than once."
4,Very Good Movie,"This movie was very good.It had a great cast including Billy Crystal, the legendary Robert De Niro, and lisa kudrow.The movie was very funny and shows that Robert De Niro can do more than drama. If you like any of the people mentioned above i suggest you see this movie. The special features on this dvd are very good."
4,Analyze This,"Overall, a great comedy. I didn't notice any bad acting, and it ended OK. Worth seeing. Not the best ever though."
4,Making fun of The Mob,This movie was good because DeNiro was funnier than Crystal in his role as a mob boss suffering from stress. The actors had good chemistry and really played off each other well. The movie had some really funny scenes in the beginning but trailed off near the end. Not a bad family movies if not for the language. Worth the price.
4,It's great go and see it,This movie has great performances all around. It is very funny. I liked seeing Robert DeNiro cry. How could anyone dislike this comic look into the mafia.
4,This is one of Pacino best films showing his versatility.,If you have ever seen a gangster movie with Al in it (and who hasn't) then throw in a little Comic Relief and a dash of Freud and you have the makings for one of the funniest movies of the year.
3,Analize This,"I thought this movie was laugh out loud funny. With a leading cast of Billy Crytal, Robert Diniro, and Lisa Kudrow, this movie has a big mobster who is going to a physicatrist for stress. He on the way is wanted to be killed as it has shooting. This film will have you jumping in your seats with laughter in this action packed film."
2,Very Funny....for a While,"ANALYZE THIS (1999) * * 1/2 There are a lot of big laughs and great lines in the first 45 minutes or so, but then it all starts to crumble in the second half when Billy Crystal's character starts to behave unbelievably ( he appears at a meeting of a group of family heads and isn't even scared..he does schtick). DeNiro is ""very, very good"" (although he could probably play this role in his sleep). Supporting cast is full of actors who have made a living appearing in Mafia movies."
3,"Funny gangster flick; De Niro, as usual, dominates","This is a pretty funny gangster flick in which a mob boss (De Niro) decides that he needs to see a psychiatrist (Crystal) to deal with his anxiety attacks. His colleagues are getting knocked off right and left, often right in front of De Niro--of course he is anxious! As is his custom, De Niro dominates the film with his trademarked impeccable gangster persona. Crystal also turns in a fine performance as the shrink. This is a genuinely funny flick. Personally, I would have liked it better had the humor been a bit more subtle; at times the comedy becomes slapstick, which I am not partial to. Nonetheless, this is a funny and entertaining film. RJB."
3,Feather-lite maffia romp,"'Analyze This’ does pretty much everything it says on the tin. A light-hearted, family-friendly (think City Slickers with mobsters instead of cowboys, or Sopranos meets the Keystone Cops) escapade where top psychiatrist (Billy Crystal) ends up unwilling private shrink to gang-boss (Robert de Niro). Harmless fun with snappy one-liners aplenty and a cast of colourful characters including Lisa Kudrow and a host of familiar maffia henchmen. Unfortunately, this movie is considerably less than the sum of its parts; an only-slightly-better-than-average family movie with Billy Crystal (there is no doubt that this is his movie) in good form, although Robert de Niro’s horrifyingly unconvincing ""crying"" attacks and the endless stream of regurgitated maffia clichés that should have been laid to rest with Steve Martin’s definitive 'My Blue Heaven' bring the average down to 3 stars.à"
3,After analyzing it.......,".....I found that this movie wasn't to funny. I have no idea what they were trying to do in this movie, but it is definitely NOT one of my DeNiro favorites, as a matter of fact, it's nowhere near the top. It's worth renting, but not worth buying."
3,"Funny, with reservations","This is a funny formula type movie but would have been better without the constant F bombs every sentence or so. Lisa Kudrow was a bit miscast, I thought, but De Niro excellent as a neurotic mafia boss. Entertaining but could have been better."
2,"A terrible De Niro movie, shame on him.","This movie is nothing more than a theft of plot from National Lampoon's 1997 hit ""The Don's Analyst"". If you want to see a hilarious psycho-spoof about a Mob boss, see this one. Robert Loggia is, as always, excellent and very, very funny. The rest of the cast supports with vigour.As for ""Anylyze This"", if it weren't for De Niro I would have given it 1 star. Billy Crystal is his usual incompetent self; Harold Ramis fails miserably.Don't waste your time on this one."
1,Awfull,"This film is Bobby Deniro at his worst. the script is not funny and Billy Crystal just gets in the way of a terrible film. I was forced to watch this as the mystery screening at the E.I.F.F(Edinburgh International Film Festival) and I was appaled. Avoid like ""The Postman"""
1,De Niro must have been blackmailed into this stinker.,"This is lame. Lame story. Lame acting. Lame humour. I usually like the movies in which De Niro plays. In this one he's as lame as the rest, and even at his best he wouldn't have made a significant difference. If anything it would have been more ridiculous."
3,deniro should be ashamed,"This is one of the most un-funny movies I have ever seen. Watching, it I couldn't believe real actors signed on to do this. The jokes were so cheesy."
2,Not That Funny If You Analyze It,"If you analyze this movie, you find the very stereotypical character played by De Niro, wasting his time doing God knows what. The psychiatrist played by Crystal spouts some Fruedian nonsense that is neither humorous, nor serious. At the movie progresses all actors seem to conspire to overplay their roles--they almost compete against each other as to whose mannerisms will be more pronounced. The end is contrived, which is probably the logical conclusion for this lame movie. It symbolically self-destructs, having managed only a few laughs along the way."
3,I only watched it for De Niro,whose crying really annoyed me. I actually had to fast forward through it. I liked Billy Crystal more in this movie than I did De Niro.
3,"Funny, but pass the popcorn.","I enjoyed this film. I would not, however, call this a ""must see."" Crystal was dead-on, which surprised me. I am not his biggest fan. This was not one of De Niro's best performances. When serious, his performance is adequate. His crying scenes were awkward at best. The performance went so over the top, I was at certain points expecting him to break character, and turn the scenes into a put-on. Director Harold Ramis has a long and respected comedy dossier, but some parts of the film fell into a sit-com of predictability. Unfortunately, we have ""The Soprano's"" as a reference at this point, which hurts this film and makes me wish this film had tried to achieve more. I saw the film last night, and will screen it again for good measure, but I wouldn't say this film brushed ""Stripes"" or ""Ghostbusters"" territory."
4,Funny and B R I L L I A N T!,"Oh yes this movie is not to be missed if you are after good commedy which is very rare these days!The story is one of kind (a mafia boss going to a shrink), and Robert De Niro with Billy Crystal both did an amazing job... forget about the actres, she was not all that! But still it is good.If you want to enjoy this movie don't think of it as it can be real or not... instead swallow it as a light funny meal."
5,"Laugh, My head nearly fell off !","Well, what can I say...... This movie rates up there with some of the greats over the last 20 years or so. If you don't buy this you need shooting. GET IT NOW !"
3,"Nice, but....","Not so funny, although I love De Niro & Billy Crystal. De Niro overacts in the crying scenes, but otherwise is menacing yet likeable as the Mafia boss.Billy as the psychiatrist is perfect as usual. Lisa Kudrow is terrible. The fat guy Jelly who's De Niro's sidekick is good too. But something's missing in the movie. It is no 'When Harry Met Sally', nor is it 'Prizzi's Honor'. Not by a long shot."
2,mildly amusing but extremely predictable movie,"I was disappointed by this movie given all the great reviews. Typically, Billy Crystal plays it ""too close to the vest"" resulting in humor that belongs on a TV sitcom."
1,Sopranos is a better yet.,"This is aa exact movie version of HBO's show ""The Sopranos"". But, ""The Sopranos"" has better acting, better character interactions, etc. etc."
4,"Pretty funny flick, pretty good DVD",This is one of the funniest movies in recent years. The DVD transfer provides good color and sound. The DVD also has a few added bonuses like a gag reel and commentary tracks. Worth buying and a must rental.
5,Best Adult Comedy of 1999,"From the very beginning to the last moment, this movie provides consistent laughs, with each one louder than the last. De Niro does a brilliant job of lampooning himself, but major kudos go to Crystal, who finally gets out of his funk to deliver the best role he's had since the first ""City Slickers."" Watch for the ""Godfather"" dream sequence, and the church scene after that.An instant classic..."
3,It's comedy,"Billy Crystal is hilarious. However, Robert Deniro's fake crying was awful. There are a couple scenes where he had to do it and he did a terrible job every time. I've seen better cry acting on a ""Facts of Life"" episode. Other than that, this is a highly entertaining movie."
4,Great cast elevates the movie,"The greates asset of Harold Ramis' ""Analyze This!"" is the excellent cast. Not only Robert DeNiro and Billy Crystal, but also Chazz Palmentieri and the other supporting actors. I do not want to say that the screenplay isn't funny, it really is. But with a lesser cast, the film wouldn't work so well. It is essential, that most of the actors played in (serious) mafia films before. This adds a new dimension to the picture and makes it more than just a spoof in the style of Jim Abrahams rather unfunny film ""Mafia"". Towards the end, the movie runs a little bit out of steam and is not quite able to entertain as much as at the beginning. But generally, ""Analyze This!"" is likeable fun and Ramis' best film since ""Groundhog Day""."
3,A spoof on well trod territory,"If you're in a goofy mood, this will make for an entertaining couple of hours. It's just intentional silliness, but I get tired of the cliche characters whether they turn up in a satire or serious drama."
3,Where's Cage & Copywrite?,If buying this cd for the Cage & Copywrite track like I did it is only an Instrumental they don't say a word! Other than that I'm happy with the cd.
1,Not an ODOR remover,"I love the SS Orange Oxy Odor Remover - but this is not it, unfortunately. If you are looking for the odor remover it appears Amazon doesn't carry the ""orange oxy"" formula anymore. Shame too."
3,Tent,"Very difficult (for me) to put up. Great if you have a couple of people to help you set up. Wanted something I could set up, regularly, by myself. This did not work for me."
1,Total Bomb!,"I saw this movie and thought Finally!! someone made a movie based on the wonderful book by Dennis Danvers. Rented and blech! Terrible. Not at all like the book. First of all they changed the biologist's name from Erik to Dan. Then they make him a penguin biologist. Give me a break! He was a wolf biologist. Then they add in the parts like the wolf eating a little girl. Never happened in the book. and the worse part was the ending. Erik/Dan is suppose to stay with Alice. But whoever made this film did a total 180 and had the guy go back to his ex-wife. Shudder and gag. As werewolf movies this was marginally ok, especially with the effects. But the low rating is from the fact that it is totally and completely different from the book that it is suppose to be based on. If you want a good werewolf video, keep looking."
3,NOT for Fangoria fans!!!!,"If you are a fan of Fango and expect a cool horror flick, look elsewhere. This is not a bad film but not something I would associate with Fangoria. It's a decent werewolf drama but not a horror film."
3,british chic flic,"For a girl movie I rate it tops. It has a great cast mostly from british Dr. Who, Quack phsyciatrist and collegue's wife. I think I'll pitch it into the ""give to girlfriend for X-mas"" bin."
3,Can she let him into her heart again,"Nathan Ward is left at the alter and decides it's a perfect time to try and get his old girlfriend back, after letting 15 years pass. I will admit the book lost me, and I almost did not finish it. Then it picked up and I read the book until the very end. It turns out to be a sweet story that tugs at your heart."
2,Description of this item is wrong,"This item description is completely wrong. I ordered and received it in a short period, I opened the box and found that there is accually 4 lights per box. The description says it has 3 super bright LED's, and it accually only has one. The description also says it is color changing and it is not."
1,This is not related to the television show or movie,"I suppose I could have given it a higher rating for being so 'out there' but I get the impression that this guy is purely out to capitalise on the popular television series, Stargate, when this has absolutely nothing to do with the show or movie of the same name. Potential buyers should be aware of this. The same author has done this before in relation to Atlantis, immediately after the spin-off series was released.This 'presentation' is a variation on the astronauts built the pyramids and the gods are really ETs theme, and a poorly presented one at that. One of the television Stargate novels did the Mayan thing and did it well, but the author made no attempt to covert me into a believer. If you want to believe in this sort of thing, fine, but I'd suggest buying von Daniken (Chariots of the Gods, for example) or Sitchin's work, or joining the Scientology group, and give this one a wide miss."
1,Stargate 2012 - The review,"I started to watch this DVD and turned it off, it is basically a videoed presentation taken at a convention. It has nothing to do with Stargate the movie or TV series which was very disappointing. It appears to be a technical explanation of blackholes, ancient earth legends and the like. While the subject matter is interesting I found the presentation to be very long, drawn out and boring. The title is very misleading and I will repeat it so that's it's very clear this has NOTHING to do with the Stargate series.To wrap it up I thought this was a waste of my time and money. If however, you are really into watching recorded presentations of this nature it could be your thing."
1,not what I wanted,"I thought that this was another Stargate SG-1 movie. Boy was I wrong! IMO the people who made this video and who subscribe to this bizzare theory have named the DVD in a way as to incourage Stargate SG-1 fans to purchase it and thus increase sales. SG-1 fans: STAY AWAY, this is not for you."
2,Chariots of the gods meets the History Channel,"This is really weak. Take 'Chariots of the gods' meet the History Channel mythology division, toss in the name STARGATE and you have this weak, watered down presentation."
1,Stargate 2012 by William Henry,"The title sounded interesting but the product was boring. This man took everything he could put his hands on to talk quite unauthoratatively. I recommend you DO NOT buy this. But, it is your money you waste if you want to throw it away!"
2,Little Chair,"I have to say that I don't buy furniture on-line and this is an example of why I wish I hadn't. The Chair was a beautiful color and print, however I was very disappointed at the overall size of this chair. I actually thought it was for an older child when I sat in it and the legs are plastic. If this same print and color had been on a larger quality chair, I would have given it a 5 star."
5,WELL WRITTEN,Easy read and very informative. Written in such a simple language that it makes one actually interested in understanding how laws and policies are made.
2,The Orchid House,"I was fascinated and curious about Dominca and looked forward with great anticipation to a very engaging read that would provide a glimpse of the island and its life. However,I found the story line to be slow and less than interesting or inspiring."
1,A Vietnam War Chronology according to MACV records,"If I had been interested in how many Air Force Sorties were flown each day I may have enjoyed the book. I served with the 101st 1st Brigade in 1968-69 and didn't see any of the action we were involved mentioned in the book. Serving with the 1st Bde of the 25th Inf. Division and the 196th Inf Bde, both in 1970-71 revealed to me no information in this book. I actually threw the book away. Useless to me."
5,Fobus,"""The seller did well. I received my order sooner than expected. I received just what I asked for. This Fobus product is well made. I just wish the retention was a little tighter. I may need to adjust at a different angle, but I believe it is still possible for someone (with bad intent and who may see your firearm) be able to draw it from the holster. """
4,The product depicted was not the one shipped,"I am familiar with this product, I've used them for years and I find them very useful in certain applications. Unfortunately the product that I received was not the product that was depicted in the photo. What was sent was the Lowel equivalent for a Velcro rip-tie for cable bundling. I found it odd that the product literature enclosed with the incorrect product matched that depicted in the ad but not that which was sent me. Perhaps Lowel no longer distributes this product and has merely grafted the name onto another product?Upon discovery of this mix-up I contacted the seller to ask that it be resolved. I would have preferred to have the correct item sent and the incorrect one returned. However, return then reimbursement was the only option presented. I was somewhat disappointed in that shipping costs were not reimbursed as well since, in my opinion, the error was on the part of the seller, they should have borne the entire cost of their mistake."
4,Works well,Just got this a few days ago for my 4 month old pitbull mix puppy. Installation isn't too difficult but you do need some tools and it helps with another person.
2,Not for Macaws...,"I spent a lot of money on this product, but it is poorly designed. The screws that hold on the water bottle are inside the cage. My bird disassembled this product and dropped the water bottle and broke it after about 5 minutes....It would be good I am sure for smaller birds or small mammals, but not at all for the highly intelligent and resourceful macaws..."
1,Glass Water Bottle feeder,"I purchased two of these since I have two cockatoos , both males in two separate cages. One of the birds managed to life up the holding mechanism withing the first week with his beak through the cage bars. The bottle fell and obviously broke. The design of the metal mechanism is not well made. I already took the other bottle off in fear that the other bird will also figure out how to lift and disengage it. Was not happy to spend this money only for it to last a week. Now I'm stuck with one and have to figure out how to attach it to the cage."
2,Drip Drip Drip,"This is the perfect thing for my little thirsty one. But - it was a nightmarre to install by myself - it took - well - a looong time. Reaching into the crate, standing on end, I have relatively long arms but they weren't long enough to reach through the crate wires to hold a wrench and the metal plate that holds it in place. Shoo! Finally I got it on but the design of the holding mechanism won't allow it to be attached high enough ... my puppy has to almost lie down to drink. He did use it instantly however - no learning curveI also take the bottle out at night and the initial dripping that happens when I put it back on is a mess."
3,Quality construction and high capacity bottles....,"give my birds plenty of clean water so I don't have to keep filling them. They are also very easy to clean. However, they leak so it is necessary to place a cup in the cages or a saucer on the cage liners to catch the drips. This arrangement can get messy since my parrots like to make ""stew"" by wetting their pelleted food. It is not a perfect product but I can work with it."
1,It Rusted!!!,"We received our colander around Christmas time, and have used it dozens of times since. We love the style (just a little funky)and we love the fact that the design fits in our sink perfectly and keeps water from re-circulating through the pasta.However, after just 3 months of use, we noticed that the paint (is it really enamel?) wore off in a bunch of spots, and rust has taken over where the paint used to be.It's too late for a return, so I will try the company directly and post any results here."
1,Not enamel.,"This is painted metal, not enamel. The paint starts to bubble and chip off with very mild wear. With all the worry about lead lately, I worry about using this painted (not enamel) cookware item."
1,Poorly made,"This is super cute but the paint/coating is chipping and discolored after only a few uses...not so cute anymore. By the way, I also bought this in other colors/sizes and the same thing has happened, so it does not seem specific to this color."
1,PURPLE strainer,"Do NOT buy! After washing it once prior to use and than washing it the second time the paint started bubbling just above the base. Very disappointing. So instead of using it, I have it on top of my refrigerator ""on display"". Cost quite a bit to have only as it like 12 dollars to return and if I exchange it is not work the grief, gas not to mention my time is worth something."
1,pure junk,"don't waste your time...this is a piece of junk...bands pop off every shot and if you don't pull to full draw, the ammo will only fly about 15 feet...could have made a better one with a tree branch and tire inner tube."
3,MSRP is $24.95,As of this writing the MSRP at the manufacturers site is $24.95 which is less than the vendor here is trying to charge people. Look around since you can probably find it for less than $24.95
5,AWESOME!!!!,"i bought this slingshot about a month ago, it arrived within 2 days of shipping, its so powerful and accurate, i go out hunting regularly and its fun just to shoot at birds while your waiting (i go out deer and bear hunting) so 5 out of 5 stars, it rocks!"
2,It works ... barely!!,"This produce is in desperate need of firmware updates.First off, when you go to update you have to first run an early update that allows your computer to run the updates. Which isnt documented well.Second, and BIGGEST!! I am running a microsoft wireless keyboard / mouse combo. Which only has 1 USB! Which you have to plug into the mouse port to make it work. If you plug it into the keyboard port then your mouse wont work. Now the problem is, if oyur keyboard ISNT in the keyboard port then you cant do the hot switching.So ... basically for what i want it is annoying. I can have my wireless keyboard mouse ... but now i have to go to the kvm (which doesnt sit close to me) to switch computers.Grrr .... i think what annoys me the most is you'd THINK this would be an easy firmware upgarade"
3,It's OK if you only need 2 ports.,"I bought it to use with 3 computers. However Belkin does not sell [an inexpensive] all in one cable for this product... And by the time you use different cables, everything is REALLY messy. Also the worst problem is that it says it can support 4 computers, which it can, but you can only put on the sheath when you use only 2. I emailed Belkin and they said that they use the same casing for the 2 port as they do for the 4 port. So it really looks messy. The item itself works flawlessly, but I shelled out the extra bucks so the sheath would cover all the ugly cables. I don't reccommend this product unless you are going to use 2 ports, or you don't mind the messy cables without the sheath."
1,Switch?,"This switch is everything the bad reviews say and then some. I wish I would have read them and would not have purchased this item. Firmware update does not work and the beep every time you switch from one PC to another is enough to drive you crazy. Spend a little more and get a good one.I'm looking for a 4 port USB KVM to replace this one, I will trade?"
1,Waste of time and money,"This switch does not properly scan ports, your lucky if you get half the pc's working the other half need to be rebooted to be detected each time you switch to them... same with PS2 version - Junk"
2,"An Unfulfilled ""Mission""","Not a bad read; informative through some of the vignettes. Priest writes well, but leaves lots of loose ends...and omits key info. She asserts the Military acted beyond its intended role due largely to the absence of action by other US Govt agencies. Why didn't the others act? Why the vacume? Was it funding? Failed political moves? Her depiction of the powers held by the CinCs is entertaining, but not news. She makes no suggestions or recommendations for alternative strategy.If you want a light, anecdotal read, this works. Beyond that, it falls short."
4,An Intelligent Arguement,"The Mission provides for the reader not what some would call 'an intellectual challenge', nor does it challenge popular thought very much. The Mission is simply a researched backing of what we all knew already: our military is not comprised of compassionate humanitarians, nor should they be wholly responsible for making policy decisions.The book is not quite as fabulous as the hype, but its interesting. I'd recommend plowing through the rest of your reading list and then picking this book up for a nice, informative, quick read."
5,Great Read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I learned a lot from it. It discusses multiple topics in multiple ways. It is a good read for a military historian minded person."
2,Major Effort Falls Short,"A very uneven book, with a fundamentally sound point the author makes: The military has more tools (and less will and training) than either the US State Department or the UN with respect to its impact on foreign governments. I say ""uneven"" because it starts as a documentary of what the Defense department structure is, worldwide, fails to complete its ""explaining"" for each sector, and then launches into ""Kosovo in detail."" The grist for the last 1/3 of the book is probably the FOI act court transcript of the guilty sergeant, as well as reporting from the area.... but it completely fails to mesh with the front 2/3 of the book. The writing of the Kosovo 1/3 is beautiful. But the author fails to summarize the case, call for specific change, and ends with a whimper. I wish she had written a novel about Kosovo instead."
3,"Insightful, yet outdated","Barclay is one of the most insightful commentators of the New Testament. Written about 50 years ago, much of the background information and schalorship in his commentaries are outdated. Sometimes he stretched historical/cultural background too much to explain the text. Conservative readers should be aware that Barclay was a universalist (one who believes that all people will be saved ultimately). He does not believe in miracles and tries to explain them away in his commentaries on the Gospels. However, his comments on the relevance of the Bible can still be very valuable for discerning readers.Advanced students would not need be told where to find more updated scholarship on NT Bible. Beginning students should get Tom Wright's ""Mark For Everyone"" instead of Barclay's. The volume on Mark in NIV Application Commentary series by David Garland is an excellent choice for slightly more advanced students. Mainline/liberal students should try New Interpreter's Bible."
4,Great in-depth study,"This is a great book if you want to understand and know the Bible better. The author is very well educated and expounds each verse. It is no-nonsense and intellectual, but still very applicable to our lives today. My husband and I are reading it together and discussing it chapter by chapter, but it's not a typical contemporary study, with fill in the blanks and thought questions (which my husband can't stand). I highly recommend it if you want to understand the Bible more deeply and fully. Start with Mark, then decide from there. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because some people might find it a bit tedious. I did at first, but now I'm hooked."
4,A GOOD EARLY GANGSTER FILM,"Roland West's ""Alibi"" is a good example of what gangster films were like before Warner Brothers delivered its 1-2 punch of ""Little Caesar"" and ""The Public Enemy."" Yes, it's a bit theatrical, the action is patchy and the characters are less than role models of ""gritty realism."" But that doesn't mean that ""Alibi"" is a failure. On the contray, it's of interest precisely because it IS so different from what came a few years later and established a template for other gangster films.The plot and dialogue give initmations of what the ""hard-boiled"" style would become without quite being there yet.""Alibi"" is worth a look for casual viewers and is a must-have for serious students of the genre. Now, if Paramount would only get around to releasing ""City Streets"" and ""Underworld""...."
3,Alibi,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
1,Horrible Re-Dub of the original classic,"This product claims to be the original Appleseed, however, it contains a horrible re-dub of the original dubbed English track. The original was not filled with the ""F"" bomb in every other sentence. I got it because I enjoyed it on VHS when it came out, and wanted it on DVD, and I am very disappointed."
2,English translation is terrible,"I've seen both the English dub' version and the Japanese language/English sub-title version. The sub-titled version is orders-of-magnitude better. Whoever did the English dub' for Appleseed didn't just translate, but tried to localize it, swapping the original dialog for phrases and text that would sound ""more american"". The result is almost two different movies. If you have a choice, ONLY get the Japanese language version."
2,Kind of disappointing.,I was a big fan of Shirow's original manga but when I picked up the anime version I was disappointed. It seems that all the themes that made the manga meaningful were dropped sheerly for action and swearing. Very few of the characters were developed and the animation wasn't really that captivating.
3,"Good start, needs more","The animation in this one was good, and the plot was compelling enough, but if you're looking for high action, blood, and what have you, go see ninja scroll or ghost in the shell. The ending was also a bit anti-climatic"
5,I am a big anime fan and this is one the best i've seen.,This is one of the best anime movie i have seen in a long time
2,The CG Versions Are FAR Superior,"Coming from a hardcore Masamune Shirow fan, if you want to know about Appleseed, either read the mangas, or see the two excellent CGI films. This OVA from the early 80s is total cheese, taking none of the futuristic drama into account, and going for cheap laughs. It might fit the Tank Police series, but not here. Trust me, don't waste your money when this series has been reimagined into some of the finest computer animated features to ever come out of Japan."
2,Raw and Unlikable,"This movie has several things wrong with it. For one, There is no character development what so ever. Two, The animaton ain't all that great, plain and bland, not to much detail. Third, get subtitled, The dubbed is a sacrilege to the entire movie which isn't a very long running film to begin with. The dub degrades the entire flow of the film. It's terrible acting with misplaced words.The F word(not fornicate but the other one) is said mindlessly throughout the entire pic. The plot really was a bad one. I hoped it would develope more but it didn't.Good side is that i was in the hospital at the time. I had my appendix removed and my brother came in and handed me some movies. It helped pass the time away. That was the dubbed. Later i got it subtitled, and to my amazement nothing much changed except that i had to read it."
5,An unintentionally HILARIOUS anime!,"I bought Appleseed today at some comic book store because they didn't have anything else I was interested in. I wasn't expecting much, but this 68 minute anime is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. They swear like there's no tomorrow and say degrading things about themselves that I don't think I can repeat here. I've spotted at least five typos (mostly on signs) throughout the movie. ROFLMAO! The animation is fine, but it's irrelevant. Buy Appleseed without hesitation. It's a riot. :) :)"
5,"Guns, Babe, and Anime.., I love it.","Although this was made back in the late 80's this is still a classic, after WW3human civilization has crawled back into the age of peace and prosperity, Bioroids now populate the city of Olympus along with normal humans until a group of terrorist decides to disrupt that peace by stealing a top secret military hardware called the ""Multipeade Cannon."" it's up to the hot and tough Nat Dunan and her Cyborg sidekick to stop the ring leader ""J.K. Sebastian and the Handsome seductivecorrupt police officer ""Caren Mouser"" from puting Olympus back into the state of anarchy.This movie has loads of action Guns, and more Guns, one disapointing factor...,[especially for us men, Dunan NEVER takes her cloths off through the whole film.]"
2,A Major Let Down Compared to the Manga!,"Shirow, Shirow, Shirow what were you thinking! Allowing Appleseed one of the greatest cyber punk story lines of all time becomeing a 50 min Anime! Not only that but the main story line is taken mostly from the second book in the manga series, published by Dark Horse. The voices are absolutly annoying and the animation is average. If you want to get the true value out of your money pass on this and get the manga by Masamune Shirow, author of Ghost in the Shell."
5,Great Book,So far this book has a lot of great information. It is written on a very eay bases so that you can understand clearly. I really like to way she includes story of Sister CEOs which gives you hope as you read what they went through and were they are now.Overall Great Book.
5,Fantastic for all black women,I am a Black Australian woman and I found this book applicable to my situation. The information crosses all boundries and the advice useful in many situations.
4,Good,Has some catchy songs on it but some that I couldn't quite get into. Still it is great to have to see the launch of what would become America's threat to the Beatles! : )
2,ENOUGH OF THE SAME REISSUES,"Capitol Records needs to either remix this material or release original mono mixes of Surfin' USA, Surfer Girl, Little Deuce Coupe, Concert, All Summer Long, and Shut Down Vol. 2. There are plenty of these 2fers sitting out there in online music stores and used cd stores. If they are going to reissue these let us hear something new. Let us hear Brian's mono mixes, or take full advantage of digital technology and remix the tapes."
5,"Raw, primitive Beach Boys","I really enjoy these albums. True, the songwriting isn't there, for the most part (several covers), and the sound is pretty raw for the Beach Boys. However, there's an energy and enthusiasm that's quite evident, and it convinces me that these are recordings made by kids who were excited and having a lot of fun doing what they were doing. There's not a bad song (well, okay, Little Girl (You're My Miss America) is pretty goofy, but it's fun, and you can picture Dennis being packaged as a teen idol) and there are some really good ones that you'll never hear on the radio (Cuckoo Clock, Ten Little Indians, Chug-a-Lug, The Lonely Sea). If you like the B.B.'s at all, you'll enjoy this one (or these two)."
5,My Introduction to the Second World War,"My parents bought me this set for Christmas when I was seven years old (Christmas 1964). It was my first exposure to the history of the Second World War, and I was absolutely fascinated. Dupuy wrote in a very clear style, and describes the events and personalities of the war. He also provides commentary which brings matters into perspective. For anyone desiring a concise history of the Second World War (particularly someone who does not have very much knowledge about it at present), I highly recommend this set of books."
4,Very interesting,"I thought this was interesting material on how social interactions actually change the brain. Everything from developing as a child through your adult relationships. Gets a bit into the 'science' of it at times, but still quite interesting as an audio book for a long trip."
3,Okay,It's a great book if you into the scientifical part of social knowledge. The author was well informed but very dry. Its a good book overall..
2,Of limited value due to fact that neurosciences basis for emotions is barely understood.,"In a nutshell this book is about the neuroscience underpinning human emotions. Yet this so-called science leaves much to be desired as the neurological basis of emotions is little understood, as even advanced researchers in this field admit. Yet Goleman's exposition makes it sound as if the relationship is down pat and solid. neither are alternative neurological views underpinning emotions presented. Hence the book give the incorrect impression that there is an agreed upon concensus among neurological scientists regarding the basis of emotions. The reality is far from this. Thus the book is of very misleading."
1,Total waste of time and money,"If you like a rambling style of discourse that goes on and on about social experiments you might like this cd or book. The author has no concept of summarization or conciseness. Disc 1 was full of ramblings about anecdotal events remotely related to social intelligence. Same with disc 2, ditto for disc 3, disc 4 and sadly, disc 5.The author never provides suggestions, recommendations, or plans or action plans for improving one's social intelligence.This set of CDs would more aptly labeled, ""One man's ramblings about what he read in the news in the course of a few years""."
4,Very cool read,"I enjoyed this book a lot; especially the parts about narcissism, the Machiavelli and the psychopath. Soon after that it got really into martial relationships, which, me not being in one, didn't apply to be immediately, but very insightful. Overall a good read and worth your purchase if your into finding out about how the brain works and how we get in tune with one another."
4,Definitive work in the field of social neuroscience,"The author discusses the importance of relationships and how they impact both our experience and biology. The book provides a good foundation upon which the reader can further explore the field if interested.Social intelligence is broken down into two facets: social awareness and social facility (how we act in response). Drawing on the behavioral and biological effects of our interactions, the author provides some helpful guidance in areas from parenting to our health care system.Although first part of the book reads like a textbook, it becomes more engaging as the reader progresses."
1,The Same Book As Emotional Intelligence,"Is it just me, or is this the exact same book as Emotional Intelligence?I thought Emotional Intelligence was a good book, but it seemed like in this book Goleman just replaced the word ""Emotional"" with ""Social"" and sold us a new book.If you have already read Emotional Intelligence, save your money on this book. If not, an interesting read."
1,What a waste of time.,"I read, and enjoyed Emotional Intelligence, so I assumed this book would ""mirror"" not only his former success, but also give me an in depth review of the latest research in this area. Instead I got a repeat of the first few opening sentences, rephrased dozens of ways, but all saying the same thing and adding nothing new. I finally gave up in disgust after the second chapter, which gives this book the honor of accompanying only two other books that I did not finish - in my entire life. It was just too much of a waste of time. If you are still interested in the latest research in this area, see the article in the November 2006 ""Scientific American"" (and I'm sure there are others more recent).PS, I gave it one star because the system would not allow fewer."
2,"Enlightening, but clunky prose","This book has an interesting take on how the mind interprets the slightest events between two people such as body language, facial expression and more. The facts laid out are informative. The prose though has much to be desired. Thu author uses ""tacit"" far too frequently, and clutters his points with obscure and infrequently used words. Commas and em-dashes are not in expected places, leaving you to read many sentences over again to get the meaning. I felt I had to stall way too often and not glide smoothly along. Good scientific work, but bad read."
3,Relationships Matter!,"At times, a bit heavy on the social science but overall, a good book. Goleman's analysis of the healythcare system is spot-on in describing how the training system essentially blanches out empathy, how the system treats patients as ""things"" instead of people. Anyone who has been in the hospital can likely relate to this.His main point is that connections and relationships matter. This sounds fundamental but is easy to overlook in today's isolated, atomized societies where many folks don't know their next door neighbors.An effective presentation on the importance of social connections...."
4,A bit of a disappointment,"I had loved Emotional Intelligence so much that I was really excited to read Social Intelligence as I expected an indepth look on Interpersonal Intelligence. However, this material is better covered by Louis Cozolino in his newest book ""The Neuroscience of Social Relationships."""
2,too bad,"It's such an interesting topic but I wish someone else had written this.He cites many examples to back up what he's trying to say but it's so disconnected. It doesn't feel like it's getting anywhere. And so what? What does this example MEAN? Why is it important? Is that a GOOD thing, a BAD thing? Meh.It's ironic that this book is often about how we pick up on unconscious social cues and yet the writer seems out of touch - like he's from another time. He uses words like ""busybody"" and ""hitherto"" and I can overlook that but every other line is a metaphor and every other one of those metaphors uses the word ""dance"". Every social interaction between two people is a ""subtle dance."" YUCK.Maybe it's more obvious to me because I'm listening to the audio version, but every time he says it, I groan.Too bad."
3,Decent,"After reading ""Emotional Intelligence"" I was excited about this book, but after reading it, I was a little disappointed. I felt like he didn't have as much science to back him up and he didn't cover as much in this book as he did in EI.It is a decent book, though. So if you're just looking to learn more about the way humans interact with each other, go for it. If you are hoping for the same insight as ""Emotional Intelligence"", I'd wait for this to come out in paperback."
3,More of a Physiology Textbook,I was hoping for insight on how I can be better in business from a Social perspective. Instead this book goes into how the brain works and kid's minds develop over the first 25 years of life. This is a great book for a psychologist interested in an anatomy lesson but not for the self improvement crowd.
2,Very academic for a book on social intelligence.,"The book provides tons of stories that describe and support the various explanations of SI. The mountains of material lends strongly to the author's credibility but the book is very dry. It is a bit like going to a social event and having someone talk to you about the wonders of tax code the whole time.It did examine and articulate many of the social dynamics we see every day. It could just have used some of the dynamic in the writing. Perhaps it would have been best for the author to hire someone else to translate his findings and conclusions in written form. Someone better at communicating in a compelling manner. The author describes an ""optimal"" state of learning that is ""inspired."" Reading the book does not put you in an optimal state of learning."
2,Audio CD read too fast,"I cannot recommend this book. I found Emotional Intelligence to be similarly dry and overly technical, but it was much more substantive. Social intelligence has a few interesting points, but overall it gets annoyingly repetitive.The main reason for my review however, is about the Audio CD. It is read to you in a hurry. With all the technical jargon thrown at you, you need time to follow. This pace is too fast for a regular book, let alone this. After repeatedly rewinding and replaying, I gave up and returned it."
5,Easy Listening,Common Sense meets Science. The author has a nice way about himself. The applied science makes a lot sense. Thoughtful for those who like to think.
2,"Good,...Not Great","While the content was good, Daniel Goleman only reinforces what we already know! The contents were more a consolidation of various research out there and nothing original seems to have been conveyed in this book by Daniel Goleman.There is no consistent flow from one chapter to another and Goleman keeps moving from one EI topic to another without making any connection!"
1,"Anecdotal stories, opinion and socialist diatribes","The first one third is interesting science, but the last 200 pages are a collection of anecdotal stories, opinion and socialist diatribes, rather than social science. Toward the end, he writes, ""Such utopian ideals for the human community may seem out of sync with the tragedies and frictions of the twenty-first century"". First of all the century has hardly begun, and compared to the last 60 centuries, I would say our tragedies are akin to a mosquito bite and the frictions are like the itch that follows. This is the kind of book that makes academics look bad."
5,Froggie's Review,"This should be required reading for everyone... SIMPLY AMAZING information - has transformed the way I think and see - now reading / listening to his Dalai Lama CD on Destructive Emotions... just as useful, especially after listening to Social Intelligence"
5,Great buy!,Bought this book for a class I took on campus and did not want to pay the extreme price on campus. Found it on here for a 1/3 of the cost and it was the extact same book it was perfect. Great ship time and wonderful customer service.
4,You Associates Matter,"On page 5 under the subheading; The Social Brain, he makes this comment; ""The spotlight shifts to those ephemeral moments that emerge as we interact. These take on deep consequence as we realize how, through their sum total, we create one another."" The book goes on to explain the biological changes that take place within our brains as we interact. Our creator warns us about the same consequence, without scientific explanations, by saying, ""Do not be misled. Bad associates spoil useful habits."" (1Corinthians 15:33) It made me question myself, what other 'scientific' explainations do we need before we start listening to our Creator that many scientists deny the existence of?"
2,Audio Book Has No Contents!,"I know I ordered the audio book, but honestly, can I at least have a printed table of contents so I can understand which of the ten CDs I should put in to re-listen to a portion of interest?This product has NO printed information about the book's organization. Nothing on the box, nothing on a sleeve and nothing on any of the CDs themselves. Even the chapters are chopped up across the CDs which run a full 12 hours.I would not order this product again. A reference work should be just that - someone thing one can reference, even if in an audio format.I admit that I have not ordered many audio books and this may be what is ""expected"". If it is, I will be researching offered products carefully before ordering another audio book."
2,"Great subject, lousy book","Social neuroscience is an exciting and important topic of study. This book does it a disservice.This book is poorly organized and presents only brief summary of many fascinating ideas. You might find something that interests you, but you're unlikely to find it in enough detail to get a clear understanding of it.Honestly I expected better from Daniel Goleman and I was quite disappointed by this book. Unfortunately I don't yet have a better book to recommend instead."
2,Lizard Woman,"If you are looking for a happy little novel set in the Southwest with lovely characters who all have pleasant times and and Happy Trails...this book is not for you. Frank Waters did not glamorize the story here- it's about the desert and desperate dreams that don't pan out. I liked ""The Man Who Killed the Deer"" and ""People of the Valley""."
3,"Average. Nothing more, nothing less.","I picked up the Digital Dojo box set--which is the first season of Ranma 1/2--and thought it was excellent. I then ordered several discs from this season and was eagerly awaiting them. Unfortunately, this disc can't hold a candle to season one. The story line is just not as interesting as season one--it seems to be more childish. The theme songs aren't as catchy and there are no extras to speak of. Pioneer hasn't even put volume or episode numbers on them, so it's hard to tell which disc is which. The dub voice actors aren't as good as they were for the Digital Dojo; however, the Japanese voice actors are still good.I'm not saying you shouldn't buy this, but if you haven't seen Digital Dojo yet, pick up that."
2,"OK, I guess","I'm a big fan of Ranma 1/2 and thought this volume was dissapointing. The 3 episodes were mediocre at best,while I think the OAVs and 1st couple seasons are WAY better. For die-hard fans only, otherwise, save your money."
1,Clasp is HORRIBLE,"I had this beautiful bracelet for 3 weeks before the clasp started to become loose. Even with the secondary clasp, it fell of at my company x-mas party (4 weeks after purchase) and was never to be found. Someone got a very nice x-mas gift from me. I suggest that the making of the clasp be improved, and would not recommend the purchase of this item until then.Jim"
4,Good Fitness program for seniors,I work with a non profit senior group on a dialy bases and they love this DVD it gives them a good work out for the ones that can stand and do it. I only gave it 4 stars though for the sound quality issues and the small errors threw out the video like where he is doing 10 reps and counts to 11 o well no biggie. Me being 26 i did find the first part of the video with the introduction kind of on the comical side. and it looks like the DVD was press on a DVD-R and not a true DVD replicator like the Hollywood Videos o well no biggie there over all a well done video :)
2,"if you are really out of shape, then this is for you.",I found this video too slow a pace for me. I am 74 and usually walk 45 min to 1hr per day.
1,You were warned.,"The chrome on the racks in this oven chips off very quickly into your food. Virtually no one carries replacement parts. The oven cooks OK, but the numbers that tell you temperature and time wash off with dish soap. So after a few uses, you have to guess. Aroma's customer service is answered by a machine - even in the middle of the day - and you are told to call back during regular business hours. If you do elect to leave message - you will grow old waiting for a return call."
1,Broke in less than 3 months,"Aroma Housewares AST-900E AeroMatic Convection OvenI bought this about 3 months ago, have used it 3 times, the small power switch which holds the handle down broke making the oven unusable, the company requires you mail it back at your expense including an extra $8 to them for S&H;, won't be buying another of their products very shabbily made. Pat Wallace"
1,worse convection oven I owned,Bought this oven over a year ago and had all kind of problem with it. Cooks very good. 1st year the glass bowl for the oven exploded on me. Luckily I had a spear from another brand that my mom had. This year the handle broke in half. I had to glue down the on/off button to be able to use the oven. This will be my last Aroma product. Covection oven are great for cooking. Just get another brand. This is my 3rd convection oven.
4,Batteries Stink,Love this set but not the battery ooerated lights. Prefer electric and will see if husband can convert. I leave these tyoe of lit mangers on 24/7 and with batteries they don't stay lit long.
4,Good music,You can hear the change starting to already take place. Great songs on this even though there are still some what I would call filler songs. But still a great CD from a great band!
4,One of the Best of their surfin' albums,The beach boys would get better in the later 60's and early 70's but these are the best of their early to mid 60's surf albums
4,if you love car songs this is for you,Here is a great CD for all the car lovers out there. If you dont have it you should get it
2,K790a phone holster,"I had used this holster for my phone for about 2 weeks until the swivel broke off from the phone holder when I got into my car. Not great quality, not an OEM product for sure."
1,Not very good,"I have read this novel, and it's pretty bad. It's filled with typos and paragraphs that take the storyline nowhere. I didn't like it."
2,Not very French.,"English lyrics and melodies used in AMelie. This, good sirs, is no Amelie soundtrack!"
4,charmed,"I want to run out and scour the flea markets for a toy piano. There is a nostalgia here that is elusive and compelling. Perhaps it's the sense of childhood. Violins, windup machines, accordians, toy pianos, and unearthly delights are all here."
5,L'Absente,Addicting...Enriching....Delightful...this is the best Yann Tierson CD there is. I found this CD in Key West when I was in a boutique and it was playing and I could not leave the store until I had it with me. Great for cocktail hour at parties-- I gave 5 of these as Christmas gifts due to the compliments I recieved.
2,Very Dissapointed...,"I, like so many others, was taken by the subtle magnificence of the 'Amelie' soundtrack. Yann Tiersen's moody pieces perfectly captured, not only the essence of the film, but the hearts of so many listeners. Though I was not expecting an artistic repeat of this perfectly captured CD, I also was not expecting L'Absente to be so disappointing. Here, Tiersen has added (or perhaps subtracted in good taste on the soundtrack) vocals to accompany several of Amelie's pieces...rendering the pieces campy distortions. Any charm of an individual piece is made moot by the cd's poor track arrangement. I kept listening for a tread to sew the pieces together, but was left with a jumble of discontinuity. After reading other's reviews, I was hoping to learn more of Tiersen's work through this cd. After several listens, I won't be looking any further...bummer."
2,Proceed with caution,"It is perhaps because I was expecting the smooth, charming, nostalgic refrains of the Amelie soundtrack that I find L'Absente so disappointing. I found elements on several of the tracks to be noisy, mechanical, synthetic and intrusive if not annoying. The English lyrics on some of the tunes put me off as well. Not that I don't appreciate the English language. It's just that I was anticipating something French (of which there are a few). I'm writing this after a couple of listens. With a few more, I may mellow. But this is my initial reaction. I sure love Amelie, though."
2,I am using another review becuase it is exactly how I feel.,"""It is perhaps because I was expecting the smooth, charming, nostalgic refrains of the Amelie soundtrack that I find L'Absente so disappointing.

5,I love this shirt,I would gladly wear one to work but I don't want to get fired! I work for the Postal Service and I think it's really amazing that we don't have more shootings. They pay is good but the treat us like dirt!
1,sad commentary,I agree with NO STAR reviews. What a shame that anyone thinks this shirt should be sold. I am an long-time buyer from Amazon - how sad that I won't be able to use their services any longer. I am a proud 15 year employee of the Postal Service - and am concerned that this shirt is considered in good taste.
4,Great Addition to a Grand Tradition,"Other reviewers have commented that Borges is too far removed here, or that it's a ""minor work from a major author"" -- all of which is true. If you're looking for serious *Borges*, this may not be of much interest. But if what you're looking for is a bestiary in the medieval tradition (with roots going back even further, to the 2nd Century Greek Physiologus), this is a great addition to the literature.Wry and clever on some pages, deliciously ambiguous and foggy on others, Borges' compendium of curious creatures makes for enjoyable perusal. The only thing missing, of course, is more creatures. Borges himself begins the work with a disclaimer that any such undertaking can never be complete, yet there was plenty of room for more here. Some omissions are surprising. But in any case, for what it is (and not for what it's not), I can recommend the book without reservation."
4,Lots of fun,"Yes, this is a minor work from a major author of literature, and no, this is not Borges' best, but if anyone wants an encyclopedia of fantastical creatures, especially little-known ones as well as creatures found in modern-day literature, why not get get your information from this fun little book by one of the most influential and highly-revered Latin American writers of our time? All in all, I wouldn't have bought this book if Borges' name wasn't on it, but I wasn't disappointed."
5,Perfect fit!,"I have bought floor liners before, but I have never bought floor liners that fit my vehicle perfectly. It was/is a great investment. By these first, and you will never have to buy another set in your life."
5,Good and Affordable,These are great. Each package contains a whole bunch of dolphins. Way cheaper than the individually packaged goldfish.
2,Don't be fooled by the photo,"Almost put these into my shopping cart. I thought these snacks would be a great alternative to Goldfish crackers and fairly economical too. However, from the look of the photo of the package, it appears that the serving size is twice as large as it truly is. The written description shows that each bag is .9 ounces, while the photo shows a 2 ounce bag. I can't imagine how tiny the real individual packages would be..."
5,quite clever and the cast is excellent,"I did not intend or expect to like this film, anything connected with any circus gives me the shivers, so it is a testament to this film that not only did I make it through the whole thing I found it to be a strikingly original and very clever piece of film making. How a film is constructed, its editing, camera angles, character development, use of music and dialogue tends to jump out at me and my dislike for circuses became a non-issue for the whole concept of this little thriller is as tight as a drum; every aspect accomplished. Perhaps the best part were the leads, Assante and his two co-stars. It was such a well integrated effort by all three one would think they had spent years working together. Each had a few surprises for the viewer which I will not divulge here. Get this film, it is atmospheric, gritty, at turns coarse and tender, and the lead character held the whole thing together. I was seriously impressed."
2,meh,"I only watched this film to see Norman Reedus, because I'm now a fan of his thanks to The Walking Dead. Personally, I like realistic movies. I'm also fairly young (20s) and spoiled with great movies, so I might not appreciate as much as it deserves. If your like me then you'll bang your head into the wall a few times during the movie if you watch this. Last note, I didn't even bother to finish watching the whole movie."
4,Excellent Light-hearted Fantasy,"A totally engrossing tale of the wacky adventures of Harold Shea & friends, modern-day (well, from the 1940s anyway) people transported to mythical realms and forced to improvise magic and swordplay in the thick of literary events. Pratt and de Camp are very good at presenting a humourous everyman's view of fantastic worlds and manage to combine just the right amount of wit with a deft sensibility without resorting to slapstick or satire. The adventures of Shea provide plenty of light-hearted action-adventures coupled with graceful exploration of literature such as the Norse sagas and Spenser's The Faerie Queene. Fun, furious and clever, never ponderous or snooty, and always with a twinkle in its eye."
5,One Of My Favorites,"The place: a town in Ohio. Two psychologists, Harold Shea and Doc Chalmers, have made an amazing discovery: by altering their logical assumptions, they can visit any world they choose. Of course, it is difficult to tell beforehand exactly what world they're going to visit... These stories are hilarious and extremely readable, though you shouldn't expect anything terribly deep. This volume collects all of the original Harold Shea novellas into one book. This makes it something of a one-stop buy for anyone who wants to read them, especially since the original volumes are out of print. There are other in-print Shea stories, but they weren't written by the De Camp-Pratt team, so they're not nearly as good. They're still worth a look if you're bored. though."
5,Great Biography for Elementary Students,"This biography of Charles Lindbergh is especially good for younger readers. It covers the span of his life from boyhood in Minnesota to his death in Hawaii. The book gives children an idea of why he began to fly and what drove him to achieve all that he did. It briefly covers the baby kidnapping, in only a few paragraphs and without much detail, but enough information for the younger children. It also covers his service to our country during WWII. This book was my 3rd grader's Biography Project and was very useful."
2,Not Happy...,"The Wok Shop reviews seem to be a bit skewed.Word of advice, be careful when ordering. You might not get what you paid for. I ordered the Wok set as a gift and ended up getting multiple woks but no lid. The spatula fell apart as well after the first time using it.Fortunately, I was shipped (2) of this item so I do have a second spatula but who knows how long it will last. The Wok is not of an 18gauge standard as described.Also, it took two weeks for delivery of items which was a bit disappointing when I was charged over $20 for shipping.The obscure box of items showing up was a bit strange and frustrating especially when the vendor refused to resolve the matter. I definitely would not recommend Ms. Tan's company after a series of rather unprofessional emails that transpired while trying to resolve the items that were NOT shipped."
2,threw it out,"too big for a standard kitchendifficult to season, wash, storeafter I seasoned it, weird pieces started coming off the wok... I just threw it out."
5,TOO GOOD FOR MERE WORDS,"Now (finally!) presenting the cream of the crop, the best sitcom ever in DVD quality!!! You can't lose. Walk in, grab a snifter by the bar, and savor the delight. Soon you'll be speaking French like Officer Crabtree. A good doo to you!"
4,Low Budget Excellence,"While this is a low budget film, it is obvious the people who made it took great care to use their money wisely. The special effects are actually quite good, the acting is decent to inspired, the comedy elements are well-timed, and the fight scenes are actually darn good. I know the whole plot idea sounds silly, but it is done very well. Some of the acting does come off as a bit melodramatic, though still fun to watch. I wish all low budget films could be as much fun to watch as this one."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I've never been so disappointed by a product. This unit has more bugs than the amazon (the rainforest, not this site). After 5 seconds it resets the signal from the keyboard input. So, say you're playing a game or scanning through a video, every 5 seconds you have to re-press the key. It also gets confused when switching back and forth between Mac and PC, making the all-important function key, alt key and control key unresponive or completely dead on the Mac. Supposedly you can update the bios to fix this (using a proprietary cable that you have to plug into the antiquated parallel port), but when i attempted it, it killed the switch completely. Belkin tech support's answer to the death of my $90 investment was ""replace the unit"". I know there aren't a whole lot of other options, but ANYTHING is better than this."
1,Terrible product -- terrible support,"Do not waste your time with this product. This product do not do justice to Belkin's reputation for good products. The build quality is great... but that's about it. Keys stick, Mac keyboard support is very limited even after updates to the firmware. Even with the most expensive cables from Belkin itself I experienced video gosting. The solution given to me by support folks was to lower the refresh rate and the resolution I'm using on my monitor!.. on a 21 inch monitor do you really want 800 x 600?Try the IO Gear solution instead, that's what I'm using now and have been using for about a year now. The only one thing that the Belkin KVM did that the IO gear does not do is automatically switch not just the keyboard and mouse but the other USB ports. You have to switch those via the key strokes and the on-screen menu. But the ghosting is not so prominent and at least things are not buggy.Hope this helps."
3,Decent,"This is good for people with shorter hair, but for those with bigger or longer hair, it doesn't hold as well. Also, it gives your hair a greasy look to it."
4,Perfect Reading for the Year of St Paul,"Pope Benedict has declared June, 28 2008 through June 29, 2009 to be a Pauline Year. Joseph Holzner's Paul of Tarsus is a great resource to deepen our understanding of the life of the Apostle of the Gentiles.The book is in the same vein as Fulton Sheen's Life of Christ, Frank Sheed's To Know Christ Jesus, and Alban Goodier's The Public Life Of Our Lord Jesus Christ and The Passion and Death of Our Lord Jesus Christ, but focused on Paul rather than Christ. He draws on historical records and knowledge of ancient Jewish and Roman life to put flesh on the bones of the New Testament record of Paul's life.While Holzner provides footnotes to historical documents, he would have done us a further service by cross referencing the text to the relevant New Testament passages."
2,Can't hold a candle to WHO KILLED DANIEL PEARL?,"Who cares about Sharon Stone and Charlie Rose? But the book this guy wrote about Daniel Pearl is one of the smartest, coolest books I ever read. He went undercover in Pakistan to report about all kinds of things way before American media (such as Pakistan selling a-bomb secrets). And the stuff about Pearl's murder was chilling and just beautifully written. This book is like a knock-off joke in comparison. It's like bad television. Get the other one!"
2,Craphouse philosophy from a rockhead,"This is a discombobulated, disjointed piece of junk that has two redeeming features. (1) It will cure insomnia, & (2) It is kind of fun if you live in one of the places where he traveled (Buffalo, in my case) to see how he disparaged it (not exactly inaccurately, in the case of Buffalo, but he did selectively write about the biggest eyesore in town, the Paderewski Dr. train station). The ""observations"" are the sorts of things that would be made by a self-important college freshman, such as explaining to the benighted reader what is meant by the symbolic obesity of large malls. That is, most of the stuff here strikes one as a big shovelful of malarkey, to put it politely, designed apparently to leave the impression that the author is intellectually superior, contrary to all objective evidence.You can find better things to do with your time, like watch TV."
1,FRENCH FLUFF,"""American Vertigo"" has all the depth of a creme brulee - once you break through the thin topping of burnt sugar, you sink into custard. M. Levy is one of those egocentric ""poseurs"" whom only the French could adulate. Some of his perceptions of America are interesting, but for the most part he puts everything in terms of himself and his choice of subjects leaves us with an ""Amerique Insolite"" - a bizarre America that does not reflect this country's realities. Next time, M. Levy, take a tour of France."
2,Same rubbish; different decade,"""Like de Tocqueville before him, Baudrillard, a French social scientist, is in search of the American ethos. His little essay, however, lacks the substance, perspicacity, and originality of a Democracy in America. Rather, Baudrillard's analysis tends to be grandiloquent and sometimes hackneyed...""Change Baudrillard to Levy and the above review of ""America"" by Jean Baudrillard applies equally well to Levy's ""American Vertigo"". Seems Levy even ripped the Baudrillard book's cover! It's amazing how myopic these French ""thinkers"" are."
1,WHERE IS MY BOOK???????????????,I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS BOOK YET - I'M STILL WAITING - CAN YOU SEND ANOTHER BY FEDEX OR UPS SO IT CAN BE TRACED BETTER THAN WHAT IS OFFERED BY THE POST OFFICE???????
3,Enjoyable but long,"Levy is obviously one of the brilliant minds of our time and his insights into what makes our country great are valuable. I'm not sure that comparing himself to Tocqueville is the humblest way to begin a roadtrip, however. Levy's conclusions are not revelatory, but he is appreciative of the history and culture of our nation.I'd like to go back and read the original by Alexis de Tocqueville now for comparison."
3,A tough read!,"I enjoyed about 60% of this book--the other 40% was a real challenge to get through. I'm a pretty smart guy, but even with my PhD this was pretty heavy reading. I really enjoyed Levy's descriptions of the places he visited and the insightful analyses of the places. I found it somewhat difficult to believe that folks he ran into on his journey all seemed to know who Tocqueville was--from policemen to airline passengers, they all had an opinion. Anyway, I'm glad I made it through the early parts of this book to get to the journeys. The end was quite cumbersome...I'm still not sure what I learned, but I was entertained."
4,Brian's genius starts here,"The oldest Wilson's talent is already peeking through the clouds on Surfer Moon, Warmth Of The Sun, Keep An Eye On Summer. They are all worth the price of admission for this cd, it's worth sitting through the filler for these 3 masterpieces of surf angst."
5,One of the best,"What a unique sound. Tracks like Little Deuce Coupe, Little Surfer Girl, Fun fun Fun are irreplaceable. They create a great sense of freedom and fun. The vocal harmonies and combinations are very intricate and smooth."
5,A Must Have For All Families,"This is really an invaluable life-saving tool. Every family should have one of these around the house regardless of whether or not you go camping.HighlightsMultiple power sources with standard battery, rechargeable battery, AC outlet, crank.LED Light-it isn't super bright, but it will get the job done in case your lights go out or you are fumbling for bug spray in the tent.Siren-It is pretty loud, and will certainly garner the attention of onlookers in case you are in trouble.It also comes with a coupon which you mail in to get an adapter to run your cell phone in case the battery dies. Once again great for home or camping.Offers direct communication with the weather channels so there is no fumbling with the tunning dial."
5,Good Radio,"This unit provides exactly what I wanted in case of an emergency. When the power goes out, it provides communication with the outside world so that we can learn what is going on. The weather alert went off the second day I had it due to a flood warning. There are many more expensive units available, and cheaper ones, also, but this is just what someone needs to see them through a short time of emergency."
1,Lousy radio,"I got this Radio and tried it for a few days just to reveal that it's working only on AM in good clarity. FM was noisy and a lot of static no matter how I pointed the antenna. The TV stations hardly picked up and when it did it was only standing close to a window. The rest of the features i.e the flashlight and other non-radio worked fine. I could not bring it to the Weather mode even though we had a few very stormy days in the area. The radio remained silent with no alert.All in all' it's not a bargain and it's not worth the price, not even after the discount. The only good thing in this radio - assuming it would have worked properly - is the cranking of the battery in case you're running out of electricity and batteries."
4,Eton FR400 Hand Crank Radio and Power Generator (Red),This works fine - got it in the time promised. The only difficulty is that there is not much of an instruction manual.
5,Little powerhouse,"Since we haven't yet had a real emergency, I can't speak to its use in that capacity, but this little box of energy does everything it claims to do. Use the hand crank, and the flashlight and radio work beautifully. In fact, the sound from the radio is clear and loud. I have other Eton products, and they are small compact wonders, in my opinion. You really don't need an emergency to enjoy them, but think how useful they will be when one occurs."
3,Basically works as advertised,"This radio basically works as advertised. The description said there was a fine tuning control embedded in the tuning knob but I haven't seen it. I can't get any TV audio but then over the air TV is difficult to get where I live in any case. I am able to tune in the AM and FM stations that I listen to, which are not particularly strong signals and are a bit tricky to get on my other radios so it's good enough. When you charge the battery by cranking for 90 seconds the charge doesn't seem to last for a particularly long time."
2,We returned it!,We returned this Eton radio because it takes an unbelievable amount of cranking -- about 10 minutes per hour of use! Not a problem if you plan to use it plugged in or just for emergencies; but we've lived in a home with no electricity for 30+ years so this is an important feature. Eton was fine in handling the exchange/return of product/money. We now are happy with a Freeplay radio we ordered from amazon.com which plays several hours for much much less cranking than this one required per hour.
1,Very poor quality and design,"I've had my FR-400 for a year now and mostly had it in its bag-- which is made too small for the unit to be taken out of and put back in. The bag is too small for the radio! The poor design extends to the antenna which broke off today. I've extended the antenna maybe 3x and now it's broken. I didn't abuse it either.Another complaint is the on/off knobs protrude so far from the unit that when you try to put it in its undersized bag, they turn on and run the batteries down without your knowing.Lastly, if you're trying to operate the generator knob with your left hand while looking at the front of it and holding the radio with your right, there are no more hands to operate the tuning knobs or volume. It might work if you had another person helping you, but if not, I'd stay clear of this model... maybe of Eton in general."
2,Fail on second use,"I bought the camouflage version of this radio, tested it once, and stored it for emergency use. Tonight we had a power failure and pulled the radio out to use the light function. After cranking for a few minutes I discovered that every function worked EXCEPT for the light. Second use, and already part of it's dead, and it's the light of all things. Not impressed."
3,Sound is very disappointing,"The sound quality is very disappointing, worse for me than dollar store radios. Between the speaker and the tuner it doesn't seem to be possible to catch any station without significant static or distortion. As an emergency radio, without any other options, it would probably suffice, but it will be just that, a device I use as a radio only as a last resort.I'll actually find the siren, the led flashlight, and the red led strobe to be the most useful of the items, as long as the dynamo and rechargeable battery pack continue to provide the juice.FYI, the manual states that 10-15 minutes of cranking may provide enough cell phone charge for one minute of talk time, depending on phone capability. That should do in an emergency, otherwise be ready to crank for a while to get some more bars on your battery."
2,Can't pick up stations,"It has wonderful features, but I was unable to pick up my two local NPR stations! We tried and tried, and though we are not more than five miles from one of our local stations, there was absolutely no reception. Perhaps it was just a lemon, because I haven't read this criticism anywhere else. I may try another one, because other than that I thought it was great.Eton FR400 Hand Crank Radio and Power Generator (Red)"
1,"Missed the lemonade, from this lemon !!!!","Eton FR400 Hand Crank Radio and Power Generator (Red)Grundig was the TOP-OF-THE-LINE, in radios.... From the other reviews it appears that I must have received a lemon, from the bottom of the basket.After the recommended A/C charging time, the radio played about 15 minutes. After charging, a second time for 24 hours, it played about 1.5 hours before going stone dead.When it did work, the stations failed to come in clearly or distinct. BIG BUMMER, all the way around !!!! How much fun it was to be camping, during a rainstorm, with NO light, or radio.The topper is that the cell phone charger failed to arrive before we left on a camping trip. As of this date, it is still conspicious by its absence.Grundig, where did your quality workmanship disappear ????"
1,Much of the specifications are exaggeration from the truth,"If the manufacturer didn't lie in the product specification, I would give the radio a 3-star.As oppose to the manufacturer's specification, this radio:1) is NOT water proof. This becomes pretty apparent, once you hold a unit in your own hands;2) does NOT include any cell phone charger connector;3) does NOT have a really sturdy build. This becomes pretty apparent, once you hold a unit in your own hands.Also, the FM radio receiver is very crappy. I frankly don't understand why the manufacturer didn't bother to install a decent FM radio receiver, which shouldn't be too much to ask in these days."
1,Eton FR400 Hand Crank Radio,"The Eton FR400 Hand Crank Radio arrived in very good condition. I was very pleased with the whole transaction. The box was in excellent condition, as was the radio. I was very pleased with it. I would recommend the radio to all of my friends."
4,Just Right for the Price,"I originally bought a ""Jeep"" all weather radio for my husband for Christmas - I thought paying more might mean a better product; not so, the hand crank broke on 2nd use. I then ordered this one - my hubby loves it. It contains everything we would want for an emergency radio; we have no problems picking up any of the t.v., National or local stations. The light is sufficient for an emergency and the Alert would definitely get you out of bed. The only issue we have seen is that we had it on one night and the alarm went off for no apparant reason...If not for that I would have given it 5 stars. I think this is a must for any household that lives in a storm prone area (which seems to be just about anywhere now a days): I definitely feel comfortable going to bed if severe storms are predicted using this radio rather than spending the entire night watching the t.v. which is what I always did in the past...A good buy in my book."
3,Decent Product,"This is a good radio and I was glad I had it when my power was out for 9 days during hurricane Ike. However, I thought the sales description said you could pick up the audio of 13 local TV stations and that is not the case so that part was disappointing during the hurricane and I would have preferred TV news audio to radio news."
3,FR400 Emergency Radio,The radio has one very annoying feature. When set to receive NOAA Weather alerts it will receive them but then continue playing NOAA weather reports for a wide area. When I purchased this radio I did not know about SAME technology which limits the alerts to a much smaller area in your vacinity. If you live in an area with a lot of alerts as I do in Florida then getting a radio with SAME technology will keep you from being unnecessarily awakened in the night. Go to the NOAA web site for a description of SAME. All other functions of the radio seem to work as advertised.
1,"Charge doesn't last, and adapter doesn't fit - DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!","I was really excited about this Eton hand crank radio. However, I soon realized several problems:#1-It says to crank it at the speed of two revolutions per second for 90 seconds, and the charge should last 30 minutes. Actually, the charge only lasts 10 minutes.#2-The cellphone adapter that the company sent me fits into my cellphone, but does not fit into the radio! This renders it totally useless as a cellphone charger.#3-FM channels get all staticky once you set the radio down. It seems that if you're holding the radio, your body acts as an antenna but once you go away from it, it instantly gets all this static.To sum it all up, let me just say this -- great idea, peeps, but poor execution."
4,Eton FR400 Hand Crank Radio and Power Generator (Red),"Shortly after purchasing this radio our electric was off for six days. I had the radio turned on for six days, 24 hours a day. I am still using the same batteries in the radio. This is a good radio that I recommend to anyone considering one. I am pleased with my radio and would purchase it again.Eton FR400 Hand Crank Radio and Power Generator (Red)"
1,"Cheap, overpriced plastic. Avoid.","Antenna is flimsy, and the tip broke off the FIRST TIME I tried to collapse it after use. (Feels like plastic that looks like metal.)Radio won't get a good signal unless standing near a window.Has ""phone charger"" port, but doesn't include adapters.Overpriced. (For $59, it should be a bit more ""sturdy."")If you're looking for a REAL emergency radio to last you through your next crisis, this isn't it. This is just a novelty radio, similar to what you'd win at a carnival after winning the balloon-dart game."
4,Great in Soups,"Use this instead of whole porcini mushrooms, which are more expensive, to flavor soups and stews. A little of this goes a long way. Nice flavor."
5,GOTTA HAVE GOD,"My grandson had one and loved it, suggested it to my sister for her grandson and he has become a Christian!"
2,Great item except you need a wire to connect to car speakers.,I love this but am having tough time find a part/wire that I need to connect this to car audio system. Called Panasonic and they were no help.
2,Mediocre,"The theme is good and original, but it is developed poorly. It is a tedious and boring read that won't leave you with anything worthwhile."
5,Exciting Read!,"Very exciting book, very well written. Seems historically accurate as well. This book was quite educational too- The end of this book was very movingA+"
4,An Okay book,"Of all action books I read, this was one of the best I have ever read. It is mostly fiction but touches upon history and true facts. It would recommended for ages 13 and over. Probably little kids would not like to read it for all the violence."
5,"Robert the Bruce fans,unite!","This is a young adult book regarding the history of Robert the Bruce who fought the English at the Battle of Bannockburn. It is very well written and really gives a good look at ""The Bruce"". I got to know him much better, how he and the troops prayed before the battle, the fierce loyalty and love his men had for him and the mercy he demanded be given the enemy if asked for. Don't let the fact that it was written for teenage readers keep you from enjoying this tale if you are older. Anyone can read this and learn from it!"
2,Never got it,"The only reason why I am reviewing is because I might get a response from the seller. UPS made a mistake and sent back my item without letting me know, even though I specifically told them to hold it at the UPS store. I tried contacting the seller three times already, I tried calling them, and no reponse. I would like to get the item, since I've already paid for it. I only gave it two stars for the bad costumer service."
4,enjoyable,The whole family enjoyed this video. It wasn't full of details--just enough to entice you.
5,Great DVD,If you enjoyed the old Martha Stewart Living program then you will be happy to add this DVD to your repertoire. It offers many different dishes and cuisines as you can tell from other reviews and it is fantastic to be able to relive these classic Martha moments.
5,Extremely Pleased With Product & Service,I would definitely purchase items from them again. Extremely fast shipping & great customer service. FIVE STARS!
5,"The best West Coast map ever, for the Magellan 300 ! I Love it.","This map of the West Coast states, adds over 300,000 points of interest to your Magellan Roadmate driving experience. All the street names and addresses, wineries, parks, hotels, restaurants, golf courses and all kinds of interesting places are included.As you know the Magellan Roadmate 300 comes only with the North America basemap preloaded which means you can navigate major highways between major cities; that's it...So you need this card in order to utilize your Magellan RoadMate 300 to its maximum ability, when you're driving the Pacific time zone. So many states are included, it is an incredible value!!!! Who needs a $19 road atlas, or a $9.95 folding map when you have a talking navigation system that has the whole west coast memorized WITH ALL the points of interest that exist!!!!!I love it. And priced under 30 bucks, This will definitely put the road atlas publishers out of business!!!!"
3,Cut the Third Disc,"I am a huge fan of Modern Drummer and most of eveything they do is very informative and entertaining. This set is great until you get to the third disc. Most of the interviews lack a great deal of personality. It is a great skill to play the drums well, it is an even greater skill to explain what you are doing... some of these great drummers fall just a little short."
5,Modern Drummer Festval 2005 DVD,"With Jason Bittner; Rodney Holmes; Keith Carlock; Chris Adler; Chad Smith and Ian Paice; Jojo Mayer; Zoro; Latin All Stars with Sheila E; Alex Acura; Raul Rekow and Karl Perazzo; and Roy HaynesA Three-Disc set containing over 7 hours of footage!This year, the world's most prestigious drum festival relocated to the spectacular, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, (NJPAC), and the combination of world class talent and world class facility raised the bar for every other drum festival on the planet.Discs One and Two feature Saturday's and Sunday's incredible performances and Disc Three features full-length, in-depth interviews at pad kits, with detailed discussion and demonstration of drum technique, practice tips and more-an MD Festival DVD first!Special Features include and a 10-page booklet, a photo gallery, Web links, and more.Running Time: 7 hours, 10 minutes."
4,Inspiration,"As many of us have read the review in MD about Rodney's performance...his performance is great. The real gem on this DVD is NERVE...yes the band with JO-JO Mayer...this is where the rubber meets the road or technique meets musicality...this segment alone is worth the price to any drummer who wishes to up their game on the kit. All I can say is WOW...not for the technique alone, but for the musicianship Jo-Jo demonstrates...this is a must have...I am now a huge fan of the band NERVE...and so will you after viewing."
1,Not The One You Want,"I purchased this camera thinking it might be a good deal. I understand you get what you pay for, but this is way beyond reason. I was able to take three pictures before my twelve dollar pack oF triple AAA's (four pack) was done for. Not only that, but the pictures that I got were horrible. If I wanted a 7.1 megapixel picture of my dog as a black cloud I would have bought a disposable digital camera. Although, I bet those might be made of better quality.DON'T BUY THIS 7.1 MEGAPEICE OF @#$# CAMERA."
1,Worst digital camera ever!,Quite possibly the worst digital camera I have ever come across. My son received this camera for christmas and we were not able to take a decent photo in any light. I have used digital cameras since 1999 and have never seen such poor quality.
1,Very Disappointed...Will be returning it ASAP,"My daughter received this camera for Christmas and it was a total let down. The quality of the pictures were very poor. Lighting in the room or outside has to be perfect and the person or object that you are photographing has to be perfectly still, otherwise the photos are blurry and distorted. I would not recommend this camera at all!"
1,16 minutes..........,I was very disappointed because the movie is only 16 minutes long..so not worth the money. The movie description fails to mention the lenghth of the movie. I felt cheated. I wouldn't recommend this movie.
3,"Fun, But Way Too Short","The Shrek Story Continues in A Short 3D Advednture.The Story Takes Place After Shrek, and Before Shrek 2 in Which Shrek and Donkey Have To Save Princess Fiona From Ghost Lord Faquad.This Was Fun, But it Was Only 15 Minutes Long, and Just Ended Up Too Short. The Animation Was Great Though. I Think This 15 Minute Film Would Be Better Off Without Being in 3D.Overall Rating-3/5"
5,Shrek 3-D,"I have always enjoyed the ""Shrek"" movies. When I saw this DVD online, I knew I had to add it to my collection. This is a continued adventure from the first ""Shrek"" movie. The 3-D effect makes this DVD even more enjoyable. I would recommend this DVD for any Shrek fan."
3,You made me so very happy!,"My nephew was glued to the TV! This DVD was ""as promised"". I would definitely buy from this vendor again."
1,Yesterday's tech,"Ordered this along with quite a few other 3d movies. Perhaps I wasn't paying attention, but I assumed this was a blu-ray 3d for my year-old 3d player and tv. Much to my disappointment this was the old red/blue cardboard glasses type. Sooo not interested. Complained to Amazon, since I ordered it after searching '3d movies' and getting a list of many blu-ray 3ds with this mixed in. And here's why I LOVE Amazon: I was told to keep the movie and given a 100% refund. I wound up donating the dvd to 'Toys for Tots.' Thank you, Amazon."
1,Shrek 3D Movie,It was not the full movie - it was only a preview for about 10 minutes. Very Disappointed - Money Wasted.
4,kid like it,"Loved the price, this item is hard to find in IL. I like to thank the sender for sending it to me in a timly fashion."
2,SHREK 3 D,"I CAN NOT SAY IT WAS GOOD IT WAS ONLY 15 MINUTES LONG. JUST WHEN YOU START TO GET INTO IT ,IT'S OVER. WOULD NOT SUGUEST YOU BUY THE MOVIE IT IS TO SHORT TO CALL A MOVIE"
1,Not true 3d Not the movie Shrek but fun,The title is deceptive in 2 ways the DVD is not shriek but a short outtake and it is 3d although the glasses seem to give it a bit of dimension NAND for use in any tv and dvd
2,Not Worth the Money.,This movie is so short.. Once it begins and starts to get good it's over. It really isn't a movie but more like a Preview.
2,OK product,It is an ok product for a very remidial user. I thought it would be a little more informative. Good for the price.
5,excellent review for mcat o-chem,"If you did well in organic chem 1 and 2, then this book is great for a quick review. the best part is you can even go through it quickly."
3,"USED TO BE the perfect balance between ""premium"" and ""affordable"", UNTIL PRICE INCREASE","I'm sad. I used to be able to purchase a 35 lb bag of this dogfood from Amazon for $39.99 with free shipping and my dogs liked the food. The jump in price is why I'm dropping my rating from 5 stars to 3 and I will no longer purchase this food from Amazon. I'll be going back to my local feed & hardware store to see if I can find a good dogfood that's affordable.My previous review:I love buying this food for my dogs! I like knowing I'm getting a semi-premium food, with meat as the first ingredient, yet it's still affordable. I have five dogs of my own, plus foster dogs, and they seem to love this food. None of them ever opt to ""skip"" a meal or leave any pieces behind like they do occasionally with other brands I've tried them on. This is the perfect dog food for owners who care what their dogs eat, but aren't able to cook for them or afford the more expensive premium brands."
1,Diarrhea,"Stopped giving this product to my 9 yr old lab mix because she developed really bad diarrhea. Now I have her on probiotics and scheduled a vet appointment. Other than her having a weight issue, she has never been sick. Sorry I switched to this food."
3,The dogs loved this but...,"...it gave our golden retriever an upset stomach (all over our carpet...). She does tend to have a sensitive stomach anyway, but it seemed a little worse with this food."
3,The dog doesn't hate it.,"I'd hope our dog would be thrilled with this but she's kind of ""meh"". I did order the senior variety -- we'll see how this goes."
3,HUGE Price Increase!!!,"It used to be 5 stars for the price, but now it's just like all the rest of the expensive dog food. I have been feeding my Rottweiler Blue Buffalo since she was a puppy. We soon got tired of running to the store and paying high prices, so I did research and found this awesome dog food at a great price. This actually even got rid of her HORRID gas she has always constantly had on Blue Buffalo. Not paying this price though now that it ends up costing me more than Blue Buffalo. I guess I'll try Canidae dog food and see how she does on that, which I was going to try before I found Chicken Soup for a better price. Now Canidae is the most reasonably priced good quality dog food. BOO Amazon or Chicken Soup (whoever raised the prices)!"
5,Good Quality Food For Cost,"Has researching dog food ever made you sick? All the reviews, what should I buy, will it hurt my baby?Well I have....until I came across Chicken Soup. This is a high quality food (4-star, A+) without the cost associated with 4-star foods. It's also corn free, which helps if you have a dog allergic to corn.On top of the good quality....our dogs LOVE it. I definitely recommend this product to anyone researching quality dog food."
5,Great product at a great price,I had my dog on PetSmart's brand of food that is gluten free. But it came in small bags and they charged an arm and a leg to ship a larger bag. Chicken Soup got a great review from dog food review sites. My dog eats it and seems to love it.
1,My Corgi will not eat!,"I ordered this based on all the good reviews. I mixed it in with her other food, and she literally picks it out and drops it on the floor. She wants nothing to do with it. I have offered it to her now for a couple of days, and she refuses to eat it. Will NOT order again, and sure wish I could return it!"
5,A must read for serious Bible students!,"In studying the Bible, we find that there are prophecies which tell about most of major world powers which have ruled our world. How unthinkable it is that America, the greatest nation of all time, would not be mentioned in the Bible! This book brings together the truth of God's Word with the exciting fulfillment of actual historical record. Anyone who is serious about understanding the prophecies of the Bible should read this book."
3,a dissapointed reader,"i know this isnt like the other reveiws you are reading...but this is my feedback:1. uglies was awesome, it was an excellent beginning to the series. Westerfeild has outdone himself!2. pretties was semi-good, it lacked the passion and skill of the 1st book.3. specials was ok...until the end, i was very dissapointed with what is supposed to be a satisfactory ending. unless there is a top secret 4th book coming out...i hated the ending of the series."
4,The end to a great series,"I just finished this book, the 3rd book in one of the best series that I have ever read. It was worth the wait. This book, unlike many other teen novels, was never predictable- it left you guessing until the end. I found the end a little disappointing but I know many other people who disagree with me. If you have read all of the books in this series, you should check out some of the other books by Scott Westerfeld. They are very well written and give you a new perspective on the world"
4,a series that will satisfy. . .,"I am most definitely pleased with this trilogy. From the beginning I was pulled into these books. The first book, Uglies, was full of excitement, the most thrilling book of this trilogy, and(as I always am with sci-fi)I was forever trying to learn more about Tally's world. The next book, Pretties, was a bit less exciting, but a very good book, none the less. I thought this second book seemed a sort of standstill, kind of a stall between the cliff-hanger beginning and the climatic ending, though still a good read and a necessary piece to this series. The final book was probably my fav., and, I thought, the most complex piece to this 3-part story."
4,"For fans of the first two books, this 3rd volume will not disappoint . . .","My daughter (who is 12) read this series and recommended it to me. She and I share a love of fantasy / sf novels, and we often trade books back and forth.I thought this series would be a bit juvenile, and yes, it is definitely targeted for teens. However, it is also well written and entertaining, with some fascinating concepts centered around a dystopian-but-hopeful future society. If you are a fan of light science fiction, dystopian fiction, or ""futures imperfect"" type stories, you will enjoy it I think. It's a quick read and a real page-turner.This is the third book in the series, and was not quite as good as the first two (I liked ""Pretties"", the second novel, best.) However if you are already invested in this series, it will not let you down . . . it's quite enjoyable!"
4,The specials,The continuation of the eisteddfod series is like one long movie. You don't want to pause the book for a bathroom break
4,Not Really What I Expected...(Spoilers),"The series took a bit of a turn with this book because Tally became a Special, and to some degree, wasn't really the same person. It's hard to read a book when the main character is not how you expect them to be or different in some way. I sort of liked where the story went, but I felt the ending didn't work. I was a tad disappointed, but still enjoyed this one."
5,SPECIALS: Amazing Book for Young Adults,"This book was the perfect ending to a spectacular trilogy. The plot is so well crafted and there are twists and turns that you would never expect. Scott Westerfeld executes the story perfectly (again). The characters seem so real to you and you almost feel like you're there, cheering them on. This is one of those books where you just can't seem to make yourself put it down."
4,"Good, but not great","This was another excellent book in the Uglies series (Uglies, Pretties, Specials, Extras) by Scott Westerfield. It demonstrated good writing skill and an interesting plot line. The main character, Tally, is a dangerous ""Special,"" a surgically altered human with extra strength designed to keep control in her city. The only thing that bothered me in this book was how some of the characters cut themselves when they were under a lot of stress, a problem which is fortunately resolved at the end. Otherwise, ""Specials"" is a unique and thought-provoking book. This is not a five star book because it's not a book that I would re-read over and over. It was enjoyable, and I read it twice, but somehow it just didn't draw me in as Uglies and Pretties did. The middle of the book slows down and drags a little bit. However, this is still a book worth reading."
4,Great Book; Ending Slightly Unsatisfying,"I loved the Uglies Trilogy and the book Specials was no exception. However, I had a certain expectation of how the book was going to end and the book didn't fulfill my hope; the ending left me slightly disturbed and unfulfilled. Looking back I can see that the author was leading in this direction all along, so I suppose the ending is logical. The description of people who keep cutting themselves is also disturbing--I hope it is not giving people ideas who otherwise wouldn't have thought of it."
3,Too long and unsatisfactory ending,"This review contains spoilers. I found the first two books in this series totally engrossing and couldn't put them down. But Specials, not so much. Tally is made a ""Special"" and becomes what she's fought against in the first two books. And she enjoys it. Physically, Tally sounds like some kind of monster cyborg and I kept hoping she'd finally get an operation to change her back to maybe an ugly, or at least something less horrifying than a Special because I couldn't relate to her as a villain. The author teases the reader about this twice in the book, taking Tally to the point where she almost is ""de-specialized"" but then ""rescued"" at the last minute. This was really annoying.The book is overly long and could have used some editing. I didn't buy the part where Tally ""cures"" herself again as she did when she was a pretty. She certainly retains her arrogance by the way the book ends. I decided to skip the next book, Extras."
5,excellent,"book is wonderful. my daughter loves it, she has already finished it. brand new just like promised. Thank You so much. Yes I would definalety do business again!!! Thanks again."
5,Fast paced action!,"This finale of the Uglies trilogy does not disappoint. While it isn't as thought-provoking as the first one, teens will absolutely love it. From start to finish there is action as our the main character continues to morph in personality. From start to finish this trilogy keeps teens questioning while being on the edge of their seats!"
3,Specials,"This book was okay. The first one, Uglies was much better. I wasn't a big fan of Specials though. You should read Uglies though, great book."
2,Fall from grace into the green abyss,"Having just finished the third book in the series, ""Specials"" I would have to say that in a word I am disappointed.Book 1 is a great read with fascinating twists, characters and something that the reader can really relate to. Sadly, this is the high point. While present in the first book, book 2 brings the green agenda ever further into the story, taking very pointed jabs at today and in doing so continually alienates the reader, and almost loses sight of the plot entirely at points. Book 3 ends with Tally continuing to remain the ""center of the universe"" by proclaiming herself guardian of the wilds. A sort of self styled Poison Ivy if you will. Telling the people that if they attempt to expands outside of their cities that she will know and that there may very well be a consequence or retaliation from the ""Wild""Was very disappointed to see such a great series with such promise come crashing down around its own ears."
3,A Little Disappointed...,"I absolutely LOVED Uglies. Pretties and Specials just weren't that entertaining to me. Specials was just like Pretties, I think. Both were good, but nothing compared to Uglies."
2,Worse as you go through the series,"I enjoyed the first book for what it was and liked Tally. The second book was also good, but not as good as the first. From there, the series just gets lamer and lamer. I couldn't finish the last one. I definitely recommend reading the first one. See what you think."
5,Uglies prettiest specials,We are special all of us you are ugly pretty and specialI think tally would think that true you are special just the way you are
5,loved it,my daughter read one of these books for school and enjoyed them so much that we brought two more and she loved those as well
3,Fine Ending,"The Uglies Trilogy was a great set of books. ALl of which built upon eachother to this final book, which did a great job of wraping MOST things up. I found at the end of it I was disheartened and disapointed by the way it ended. I find that westerfield is one for tragedy. In most of his books I have been disappointed and wanting more, feeling like it didn't end quite right. Specials is another addition to this pile. It was very Bittersweet. Sweet to see things finally resolved, but bitter in that someone and something was missing."
5,Wonderfull,I absolutly loved the book. It had such a good plot that it kept me reading non-stop. My dad even had to pull the book away to get me to go in the car. Over all I absolutly loved it and beleive that this is my favorite series so far. I highly recomend it to anyone.
2,"Repetitive, Hard to Follow in Places, Disappointing Ending","I thought this would be really interesting as our ""heroine"" was going to be fighting for the people she had fought against. And it was, in places. However, the writing and plot were both fairly repetitive with some of the same problems that plagued the earlier books. Also, siding with Dr. Cable at the end and appointing herself the guardian of the great outdoors was really annoying to me. She became and stayed what she fought against earlier."
4,Intense,Specials (The Uglies)Personally I loved this book. It was very intense and kept you on your toes at all times. Scott Westerfield did a great job of illustrating mental images. If you loved the first two books then your bound to love the third one!
4,Finally finished the trilogy...,"I started ""The Uglies"" trilogy a while back, and finally finished The Specials recently. The series itself is an interesting concept of the future, and, while The Specials ties the story up nicely (but not too nicely), the main character, Tally, was not nearly as likable as she was in the first two novels, simply because she is now a Special and doesn't experience things as normal people do. I liked that this novel had a lot of action and suspense, and while I'm no longer a ""young adult"" in the teenage sense, I can see how this novel would have tons of appeal. I really liked the ending, as well, because it wasn't traditionally happy, and I appreciate that Tally stayed true to herself in a way that she was unable to do throughout the other novels."
5,Special Indeed,"Ever since the first book(Uglies), I have loved Tally. I love how she can always be herself and escape what other people try to force her into being. They can't force her to look a certain way or be a bubblehead. She chose that on her own, to help her friend, Shay. This book, Specials, kind of made me sad. It seemed like Tally stopped caring about other people, and she did some pretty selfish things. But it was an amazing book. It shows just what society and social standards can do to people. It also shows how people can change for the better and the worst. I think this is a great book for teens."
4,Very Good.,"I loved The Uglies and The Pretties. The Speicals was just as good. I found myself staying up all through the night wanting to find out what happened in the end. I'll admit, I wish there was a little more closure, but I heard there's now an unexpected fourth book that has more closure on Tally's story. The whole series are definitely books worth buying!"
4,Specials,"I was very pleased with how the trilogy turned out. Specials (like the two books before it)kept its readers on their toes. I liked this book because of the way the author writes, the characters, and the how the story ended. It is a book i would definitely read it again."
3,An introduction to Bob Frissell's research.,"The DVD introduce Bob's own path in search of the missing link of the multi-dimensional universes covering the 1960-1990 period. It provides a number of leads for viewers to find their own path. The video is a low cost production and not a workshop. It is also too short in trying to cover a wide range of information surfaced during Bob's search. My friends find the information not well presented, without depth and not convincing. Nevertheless, it is good enough as an introductory DVD to the subject."
5,"Out of print, but charming book of tea, from Malachi McCormick","This charming little out of print book by Malachi McCormick will find a place in the heart of all those who love the almost magical world of tea, and the men who have labored to bring us better and better teas."
3,Too heavy for our family,"This set of silverware is very beautiful. We decided to send it back because it was way too big and way too heavy. The quality is excellent, just too ""lumberjacky"" for our needs."
5,Excellent design,"I can't speak to the debate about the composition of the metal used in this design, but, I can speak to the design itself. I have owned this design and used a full set for about 3 years. I have had no problems with staining or rusting. Each piece is pleasingly heavy and balances well in the hand. Someone actually took the time to think about how the pieces feel when you use them for their intended purpose ------ answer is ...... very, very nice. The lines are simple and elegant and, I think, the set is compatiable with many styles of tableware. Great buy, in my opinion, if you can straighten out the 18/0 or 18/10 to your satisfaction."
1,"Bad Quality, Stains and Rusts Easily","We bought this set based on the looks and good reviews. However after only a month of use we started noticing black stains and rust stains. We figured out that if they are not dried right away, it will stain. Which is impossible because we don't have time to individually hand dry them or when we use the dishwasher (even with the heated dry option) they still don't completely dry. I would not recommend this product. As soon as I find another set, I am going to replace it. Waste of money!!!"
4,Flatware from Oneida,"I personally viewed the item at a major department store last month. Noting the price I decided to check out Amazon for comparable prices and resulted in my saving $30.00 with out having to visit the department store again. Very efficient on delivery and payment, the item was exactly what I had anticipated."
5,Excellent Buy!,"This is one of the best buys in flatware that I have seen! I purchased this set from amazon for just under one hundred dollars and received free shipping. Visited Macys over the weekend, same set retailed for more than $250! Comes with wooden cady, which is a nice added bonus. Great set that should last many, many years."
1,Not 18/10 stainless steel,"Right now the set is advertised as 18/10 stainless steel on amazon.com, but the set is actually 18/0. One proof is that the set is magnetic (18/10 steel is not magnetic). Second proof is that the set is specified as 18/0 on [...]. 18/0 steel develops brown stains with time. 18/10 steel does not develop stains. This set is going back."
4,Beautiful and well designed,"We bought a set of these and love them. They are beautiful, elegant and of significant weight. When you hold them and look at them up close you can tell they are a high quality flatware.We wash them in our dishwasher and haven't had any discoloration problems. You have to be careful not to let them sit in standing water; specially the knives. Any satin finish flatware will show weird staining/spotting if you don't take proper care of it.Great set for the price. Looks great on our formal dining table when we have friends over!"
5,very good reading,"The most enjoyable book I've read in months. While you want to beleve in the president, doubts are always there. Not until the last pages do these change. As an action book it is not the greatest, but the tension in the plot keeps you right there til the end."
4,Good read,"I enjoyed the book, as I have all of Nance's books. One big question kept me haunted me all through the book though. Wouldn't a former US President travel on a diplomatic passport? If so, the whole premise of the book collapses. Generally speaking this book stretched the limits of the real world more than is typical of Nance's books."
1,Headwind,"I have read and enjoyed Nance's previous books, his knowledge of the aircraft industry has contributed greatly to his writing. However this book is trashy. The premise is so weak and the political plot line so boring, that I could not finish the book. I hope Nance regains his style before writing any more books."
2,Yawn,"I was not a fan. It wasn't very aviation-oriented. I suppose if you're into ""Law and Order"" style antics onboard a moving vehicle, this might be a good read (I'm not really into those kind of books). For me, this novel left me sitting there and wondering when anything remotely exciting would happen and why the only exciting events seemed ""forced"" (read the trip to Denver and the dash from Ireland to Maine and you'll understand exactly what I'm saying)."
4,Good quick read,"This book is a good fairly quick read, with several interwoven plots and themes. The characters are multidimensional."
2,Transparent Story,"I'm a big fan of John Nance books but I was disappointed with Headwind. A former U.S. President is set to be arrested on an international warrant while travelling in Europe. Fast paced and interesting story premise that is ruined by the transparency of the character's actions. The story constantly ignores the ability to use other obvious and simple ways for the President to get of the problem. Also, throughtout the book the characters are constantly amazed out how other characters can anticipate their only obvious option. Sorry, but I was disappointed."
3,"Not Thrilling, Not Boring. Intriguing Premise.","Reading this book was like performing a chore you'd put off for weeks. Finishing it was rewarding because all the bits and pieces scattered around the apartment in the beginning of the story were finally packed neatly away in their proper places. The politics of international law and treaties can get pretty messy.I'll admit the story was a bit drawn out and predictable, but somehow I found myself returning to its pages wanting to hear the author's tale of heroism in the cockpit and the courtroom. I learned a thing or two about both in reading this book. The author's knowledge of aviation is what gave this flight the tailwind needed to reach its destination safely. Mission Accomplished!"
5,Not Enough Fuel and Nowhere to Land,"Captain Craig Dayton flies a 737 for a German airline and is on the ground in Greece ready to take off. John Harris, a former President of the United States is aboard the flight. When Harris was in office he supposedly ordered an attack on a biological weapons factory in Peru and all the workers were tortured to death. Now, because there is an international treaty against torture, Peru has issued an international arrest warrant for former President Harris and it's Interpol's duty to enforce it.Dayton doesn't have any intention of turning Harris over to the Greek authorities or anyone else. He takes matters into his own hands, backs the plane away from the gate and takes off on an unused runway without clearance. However he's a got a problem, he doesn't have enough fuel to get to the States and most places he can land in Europe will surrender Harris.John Nance has written an aviation thriller that will have you biting your nails as you rush though the book."
3,Over the Rhine's latest still finds them beguiling.,"It's hard to rate this latest from Over the Rhine. The album isn't as elegiac and achingly tremulous as ""Good Dog Bad Dog"", but the new songs continue the duo's path of musical independence. There's a larger-than-life feel to the first track ""The World Can Wait"" which has a dramatic urgency more often reserved for James Bond themes, but somehow, it still works. There's also a terrific song ""The Body is a Stairway of Skin"" that's slinky and somnabular in the manner of Poe or the Cowboy Junkies. This new CD isn't song-after-song great, but it has moments to savor."
3,Too hip for me.,"I bought my first OTR album 8 years ago, and with all the publicity _Films for Radio_ is getting I thought it was time to see if Karin Bergquist's idiosyncratic vocal stylings finally appeal to me. It appears that they are a taste that I still have not quite managed to acquire. The AMG review of one of their earlier albums refers to ""Bohemian affectation"", and it's hard for me not to be distracted by something similar in this latest work. ""Goodbye (This Is Not Goodbye)"" is a beautiful song, though."
2,Too Much Bass,I'll admit - the banjo picking is excellent. But like too many modern bluegrass recordings they used an electric bass that tends to be overbearing. Switch to acoustic bass and I'll buy Volume II.
4,Typical Egdar Rice Burroughs,"I have always been a fan of Egdar Rice Burroughs and have read many of his series, but I had never run across this one. Since it was a Kindle Freebie, I decided to give it a try. It turned out to be very enjoyable.This novel is set somewhere in a small kingdom in Europe, where an American is confused with a King that has just escaped from an insane asylum. This has all of the main things one would look for in a pulp novel; romance, action, battles, intrigue, and a nearly perfect hero that gets into and out of some very sticky situations.This is not great literature, but makes for fun, light reading. Highly recommended."
4,The Mad King,A good work of fiction. Predictable in some ways but overall enjoyable to read and provide a break from day-to-day activities.
4,Really interesting novel in Historical times,"I have really enjoyed E R B old novels as I have read about 20 in the last few months.This book is a lone book and no others followed so read and enjoy.I would suggest that any reader print out a sequential list of the books and keep them in order because I got one out and read the ending second and it does detract from the whole effect.Otherwise, ERB has written some fantastic Sci-Fi novels along with the John Carter series.All worth reading today."
1,Sony Leather Camera Case,"I was not pleased with this item despite the fact that it was made well. The case was made of hard, not flexible, leather and didn't conform to the shape of the camera very well. It was definitely not what I was expecting."
4,Great Product,I liked the Camera Case. It was in a good condition and is definitely worth the price.
3,Lots and lots of rip-roaring western action,"Let's see, you have a batch of gun fights. You have some wild horse stampedes. There are two or three indian attacks on wagon trains. Don't forget the sneering villian. And there's Johnny Mack Brown in several hard riding scenes.This is a 13 chapter cliff hanger, and you'd do well to take 13 days to watch it, a chapter a day. Hey, it was originally made to see one chapter a week! The chapter endings are less than spectacular, in fact rather repetitious. There's at least one case of cheating...I know I saw our hero react from one horse in a stampede running over him, but the next chapter didn't show that.Well, this isn't one of the best western serials. For that, you want THE ADVENTURES OF RED RYDER or ZORRO'S FIGHTING LEGION. But it is full of action and the type of scenes you watch westerns for, even if there is lots of repetition. Three stars, but dyed-in-the-wool B western fans might give it more."
