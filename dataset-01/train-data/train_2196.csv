2,A Terrific Thriller?,"Not TOO Terrific! Although I can't say that this is a horrible movie, it didn't live up to it's expectations of being a terrific, heart-pounding thriller. Starring Sharon Stone, Dennis Quaid and Stephen Dorff ( who gave the best performance in this movie ), Cold Creek Manor was somewhat of a letdown. A couple who is tired of the busy city life move to the country with their 2 children into a old run down mansion. Soon, a stranger ( Dorff ) appears at the home stating that the home used to belong to his family. Wanting them out, strange things begin to happen in the home. While the husband ( played by Quaid ) starts to suspect the stranger, his wife ( played by Stone ) refuses to believe this nice man could be responsible. I wouldn't say this couple goes through a living nightmare as the movie suggests, but there are some interesting moments to this film but it can also be boring at times. The acting was good but this movie could have been alot better."
3,If you overlook everything that couldn't POSSIBLY happen...,"...then then movie isn't bad. However, anyone with any sense of reality would have problems doing so.Forget everything you've been taught about life- this movie doesn't follow those rules. Instead, it expects the audience to dumb-it-down and just buy into every error there is.Other than all of the impossibles this movie presents, it's a mildly good thriller. However, all of the ""errors"" lowered it big time for me. 4/10"
1,I told my wife not to rent it . . .,"And she didn't listen. We were bored out of our heads. I left her watching the movie and went to read. From what I saw it was a one dimensional plot with one dimensional action and pointless screaming. You are clearly aware of who does all of the bad things in the movie . There is no suspense. The plot is retread you've seen a thousand times. Not interesting or worth renting (let alone buying)in the least. Fortunately, it was only a 99 cent rental and that was about 98 cents too much. To be fair, I'll give them an ""e"" for effort. That amounts to about 1/2 of a star. It is not even deserving of a full single star.Save yourself and do not rent this movie. it is not worth your time. Or mine."
3,"""Cold Creek Manor""","Yea, it has it problems believe me! Like a horrible begining. The film is set up so bad you really do not know what is going on. Add some bad acting and your down in the dumps for the first part of the movie. (Plus the snakes in the house scene was so funny, even though it was ment to be scary.) After you get past the horrid begining the movie takes up speed and starts to become actually good. The plot really thickens and the tension builds. I like how the film came out in the end. I am also pleased with the DVD. It has some nice features. In the end, I would give ""Cold Creek Manor"" a try, you might enjoy it.(P.S.: This is not a ghost story, it is about a crazy man who murdered his family in the house this family bought and the family is starting to uncover some of the facts, thats why he comes after them.)"
2,House from hell,"This is a particularly egregious example of a Hollywood genre I call ""The House from Hell."" Upwardly mobile yuppie couple with two semi-adorable kids escape from the city to the country. They buy a big old beautiful house in need of some repairs. They will have a lot of fun fixing it up, the kids will be away from the bad influences and dangers of the city. They will share joyous years together and live happily ever after.Not.Actually this film has some redeeming qualities, but the hackneyed plot and the very annoying endless stupidity on the part of the yuppie couple (Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone) in the face of the behavior of the obviously up-to-no-good psychopathic villain (Stephen Dorff) made me disremember them.Bottom line: you have better things to do with your time.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"""
1,dissatisfied,I was very dissapointed with this company.I ordered the movie with the discription that was given . It was surposed to be US format but I received the wrong format . The one that I received was not formatted for the US and ofcourse it would not work on my DVD played. When I contacted the seller I was told to download instructions for my return . The problem I had with this was the fact that I was instructed to box and pay to ship this back. I felt that I should not have had to pay the shipping cost to send back a movie that was the wrong format and not the one that was described by the seller . The movie that I ordered was described as being US format. This was the sellers mistake and not mine and I will not deal with this company in the future.
5,Good movie,"Good movie will watch again, Let friends see that had never seen movie, enjoyed like suspence movie. Just long enough to keep interested."
1,Mike Figgis.... You should have known better!!,"Dennis Quaid, Sharon Stone... both of them respectable actors. With a cool poster and some clever trailer, you would have tought this is good suspense movie. Well, it's not. In fact, it's so atrocious that it will probably earn ""cult"" status, in the ""so bad is good"" category.Stephen Dorff is so annoying as the villain here, and Juliette Lewis is so wasted, that you simply scratch your head trying to figure out what the hell wasn everybody thinking.Aargh, enough. Skip this mess, that's all."
2,Cold Boring Manor,"On the mark, get set and be stupifyed as Dennis Quaid (Flight Of The Phenoix, In Good Company) and his wife Sharon Stone (Catwoman, Basic Instinct) bring their two kids, the daughter is played by Kristen Stewart (Catch That Kid, Panic Room), as they move into Cold Creek Manor which was onced owned by trailer trash/ex-convict Stephen Dorff and after they move in they are subjects of Dorff's wild ticks. Not much fun with Quaid and Stone rendered boring and Dorff being a bad boy....when isnt he a bad boy in movies? Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers, Cape Fear) plays Dorff's sleazy girlfriend or whatever she was...judging from that sex scene between them two she was a trailer quickie. The suspenseful music is retarded and supposed thrilling sequences arent that good and its too much predictable and obvious. Also starring Christopher Plummer (National Treasure, Dracula 2000)."
3,poor direction,"If I were to guess, I would say that this was the first piece this director has done. I know the quality acting abilities of the cast, yet their shock and surprise was over done and not believable, un natural. I believe this was due to poor direction.It was very predictable and the music tried to build tension when there wasn't really any. It was a good plot but I think it could have been done better."
4,A Decent Thriller,"Shoot me for liking this movie, but this movie actually held my attention and I really liked the preformances from Dennis Quaid, Sharon Stone and especially Stephen Dorff. Dorff always does an excellent job as the bad guy(i.e. Blade). He's just so right for it and plays it off very well. I really beleive it was the actors who saved this movie from being a dull thriller. Other than that, the movie did have a couple of good scenes to make you squirm (snakes, dead horse in a pool, dead people in the bottom of a waterhole). Not a bad movie overall."
4,Hitchcockian Mystery,"Inspite of what other people have said about this movie, this was not as bad as they say. It is in the steps of Alfred Hitchcock, meaning that the movie is slow, but in every scene, a new clue comes to life, giving you more possiblities upon who dunnit!""Down the Devil's Throat"""
1,The Other Reviews are too Nice to this film,"Waste of time, waste of money and it is a horrid movie. You would think with two stars they could at least have made a decent ""Hollywood"" film, instead of this ""thing."""
1,Cold Creek Manor,"Please don't go see this movie if you are looking for a true thriller! Even with Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone (both whom I think are excellent actor/actress)in this movie it was pitiful. The movie started out so slowly and just dragged on. My husband and I kept looking at each other and saying....what is the point to this movie. Finally towards the end some tension is built, but overall, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in several years. A BIG disappointment. If you really must see it, wait for it in DVD."
2,A generous two stars. Dennis Quad deserves better.,"I was very dissapointed with this movie. The hype and previews were great and got ya real interested, but the movie was slow and boring at times. Many things were left unexplained such as how do you get a dead horse in a pool without anyone knowing? And what's more, how do you get him out? And what ever happened to the sheriff at the end. Does she croak or live? She was a good character that should have been more developed. The nudity and sex scene was unnecessary to the plot. Don't waste your money."
1,Disgusting...Do Not Watch This Movie...Avoid,"This movie is horrible. From the outset, it lacks any moral integrity. This movie should not be watched by adults or children. The language is beyond foul, as is other scenes in the movie. The bad thing about it is that children acted in this movie being exposed to that kind of garbage. What kind of parents do we have out there that would allow there kids to act in such a film? Additionally, the film is bad in and of itself.Avoid!"
2,Cliche' Galore!!,"I was bored with it. Went to a free advance showing without knowing the plot and thinking that it was a ghost story. It's just another""Family-moves-into-a-house-and-is-stalked-by-a-madman"" movie with all the cliches included. Quaid and Stone's characters have got to be the dumbest couple on earth! Would you invite a creepy guy who broke into your home to dinner? Believe me, you will be rolling your eyes at a number of dumb things they do.If you have something better to do with your time than to see this movie, by all means, do it."
2,mislead,"Once again the previews mislead the audience. I like most people I talked to thought it was a ghost story. No such luck. Dennis Quaid is great, Sharon Stone can't act her way out of a wet paper bag. I knew that going in but thought I'd suffer through her because it looked like a good movie.The movie was ok, just ok. As I said it's not a ghost story, but just another thriller. Don't get me wrong thrillers are great but this one was very slow to get going. Once it got going it was ok. I've heard of developing the characters but this took so long the movie was over. I should have saved my money. I could have watched this on TV when I had nothing else to do and nothing else on."
1,Takes filmmaking to a new low,"There are bad movies, then there are movies like Cold Creek Manor. It's in a category all by itself - and...I don't mean that in a good way. It's really scary...how bad the script and the storyline are, that is. To demonstrate how boring and uneventful this piece of crap is, I fell asleep watching this movie TWICE. Run, don't walk...away from this one."
2,Silly Suspense,"This DVD is described as a ""heart-pounding thriller"" with ""tension filled suspense""......it fails.Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone buy an old home in the boonies (120 acres and a manor for $210K...yeah right!) and never question any of the strange events that occur. Like a weirdo who shows up in your house looking through your things. Instead this guy, played by Stephen Dorff, gets a good meal and a job.As for suspense, it only happens during the snake scene and when the two city ding-dongs are standing over a pit....you just know one of them will be pushed in! All in all this movie could have been interesting if only the characters would not have been so incredibly weak and stupid. Worth watching but not buying unless you adore mindless scare tactics."
1,Cold Creek Manure,"Is there such a thing as a ""straight to radio"" movie? This isn't even good enough for ""straight to video""!A predictable dud with as many twists and turns as a ruler. A couple moves into a creepy mansion, the previous owner is an obvious psycho, and they hire him to fix the place up. You do the math.The real mystery here is how Sharon Stone, Dennis Quaid and Captain Von Trapp were duped into filming this slow-moving, half-dead snooze-fest."
1,Now do you even wanna call this a thriller?,"Most of ""Cold Creek Manor"" is drama, and the thrills are not even thrilling. It's beginning is OK. It kinda makes you think you're going to get an OK movie, but once they move into the house, it starts to get better, but then just crashes downhill. It becomes extremely boring and the setting of a trashy-looking house doesn't make a good and enjoyable setting. I'm wondering if some of these thrills are even supposed to make people thrilled or creeped out, because one or two scenes are actually good comedy material, like that snake scene. The ending was OK, and kind of intense, but it can't make the film better, and it just flops. It is NOT a movie I would want to see even a second time. It's just 1 1/2 to 2 hours of waiting for the film to actually get better."
2,"MIKE FIGGIS, OPUS 12","*1/2 2003. Directed by Mike Figgis. A NYC family buys a house in the country. The mansion's former owner starts to harass them. A surprisingly bad movie from the British director who never manages to enthrall us with a story seen a hundred times. I really don't know what happened to the inspired director ofInternal Affairs,Leaving Las VegasandOne Night Stand. There are several themes in COLD CREEK MANOR that could have been interesting to evolve like the difficulty for an urban family to integrate in a small town or the implied sexual elements of the story for instance. Instead, we have to watch a pseudo horror movie without any originality. Inadvisable."
1,"Great Movie, MADE IN MEXICO!","I love this movie. I loved it the first time I watched it. It is a thriller, scary type movie without any demons or aliens in it.As for the disc that one is buying, I had to return one because it became stuck and then digitally challenged, and couldn't play any further.Amazon has sent me another of this movie. I haven't opened the package yet, because on the back of the sealed paper the words, ""MADE IN MEXICO"" is printed.I frankly don't know if this movie has been sold to someone in Mexico to make reproductions or not. But, I think that explains the bad quality."
4,The director is the one who did Leaving Las Vegas!,"WTF! I have no idea what happened when this director did this movie, he was off to say the least. Anyhow I bought this movie because of Kristen Stewart, she was great in this film, you can see the beginnings of the adorable bitchface of hers!Sharon and Dennis are great actors yet here seem out of balance. Stephen D and Juliette L are the gems in this film, I agree with the director on that."
1,IT LEAVES YOU AS COLD AS THE CREEK,"This had a lot of potential, but it fails to entertain let alone scare the viewer. I wish I could figure out just what went wrong, but so much is wrong with this movie that I hardly know where to start. You know you are in trouble when the man of the house finds a stranger in his house and confronts him with nothing more than a blank stare. It just goes down hill from there. Soo much talent was wasted on this film that the only reason to buy it would be so that you know how bad a film can get."
2,Not Worth It!!,"This movie was a joke! Take every element from any other ""scary movie"" and you will find it here. It wasn't even close to being a thriller! Save your money and your time for a better movie cause this is not it!"
1,Do not even bother,"You will have this plot figured out in the first 25 minutes. It was not scary, suspenseful or even interesting. I found myself wanting the last 2 hours of my life back following the completion of this movie. Generally the idea of a thriller is to keep you guessing, or at least to give ONE plot twist. Guess the writer never got that memo. Keep shopping."
1,Sharon Stone is about as interesting as...,"...a rock. One-note, shrill acting. Poor Dennis Quaid, stuck in this house...and this movie...with terrible lines, lame plot, and....Sharon (Yaaaawwwwwn) Stone. The couple is stupid and makes dumb moves left and right. Plot is so predictable, I could have had my preschool son write it. But even my 4-year-old would have made a better acting splash than Stone.Ick.Stay AWAY!"
4,An OK Movie,"This was actually a pretty good movie. It had good and bad moments. I advise you to rent it. Don't buy it just yet. It's not scary at all but it could be to littler kids. There was one part that made me want to cry. It statled me. A horse is found dead and bloody in a pool. The way the camera is, it looks so horrible and cruel! This is a movie worth seeing once or maybe twice."
1,Not what the trailers lead you to believe.,"Most peoples impression from the trailer, myself included, is that this movie was of the haunted house/horror genre. WRONG. It's another genre of film alright. The RIDICULOUS genre. Don't bother with this movie in any capacity. It's just plain awful!"
1,"Please, what is that?!!!","Man, what a sad excuse for a thriller!! Absolutely nothing works here. I almost cried watching Dennis Quaid embarrass himself, and seeing Juliette Lewis adding another steady step to finish her career once and for all...This movie is boring, slow, pedestrian, and it causes no fear or scares. The plot holes are big, I mean BIG.This is the kind of movie that I think every executive in the stuido figured out it would be a turkey after the first preview, but for whatever reason they could not abort the release..."
1,What's this?,"Oh me goodness! ""Worst movie ever"" is too nice to call this thing! A waste of money and time! (Good thing I paid only $2.50 to see it!) Avoid this movie at all costs is all I have to say. Who ever made this movie should vanish from planet earth, and who ever decided to put it into theaters should be tortured to death, or at least until they vanish too. What can I say, when I was with my sister, watching this piece of you-know-what, I thought 4 hours had passed! (And that was only half way through the damned thing!) Also, the 'suspense' music was horrible. (When that scene with the snakes started, me and my sister couldn't stop laughing! There were only 4 snakes in the house, and they all started screaming like babies [even the father!]) Now, I usually find something good about movies I watch, but I won't even try that with this one. Bottom line: waste of money; waste of time.-Ater"
1,Awful!,"This Movie is not even worthy of a review, it was the worst movie I've seen in years. It had an extremely predicatable plot, bad acting, and in my opinion did not even make sense. You could not even pay me enough to watch it again."
2,One of the worst endings ever,"This movies ok-even though it all seems too familiar as it plods along-but the ending ruins what little quality writing snuck it's way into the story now and then. Not to ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it--the stunt with the rope that does in the villain--is pathetically unrealistic--and no villain would ever put up such feeble resistance in an attempt to escape such a ""trap""--especially one as crazed as Dorff is made out to be.I don't really recommend this movie--but if you're bored with nothing better to do--it's an ok way to squander away a couple of hours.Another thing I found tedious about this movie was the role reversals-the husband basically acting like the stereotypical wife in these alleged ""thrillers""-and the wife being portrayed in a manner like the typical male lead--with a testosterone heavy female Sherriff as well. Can anyone say ""Lifetime Movies"""
1,"Really Bad, In Spite of Fine Actors","I've always like Quaid and Stone, but even both of them could not save this poorly directed, awfully scripted movie. It just doesn't work. It's affect is flat, the scenes are so poorly directed I can't believe it made it out of the studio. It's all shiny on the outside, but the inside is dry-rotted to the core. This movie is a bad apple and not even worthy of renting, unless you're studying why films don't work-out."
2,WHOS OUT BACK?,"Well, Sharon Stone and her hubby buy a house thats real run down. While fixin it up the kid that used to live there gets out of jail. He walks right in to the house without an invite looks around and starts eating thier dinner. They just sit there with there jaws slack and then.... they give him a job of fixin up the old place. Its obvious he is a nut so he goes over to julietelewis trailer and has his way with her over and over. Sooo he soon starts to kill animals and put snakes in thier clothes and stuff like that but they can't fiqure it out so they give him a raise. Later after the pieces of several murders come to light he wants to kill them, big surprize. The cops are baffeled and denny quiad and Ms. Stone hafta bust him in the gord. AT the end the house is freshly painted and a chorus of angels are singing.But julie Lewis still loves the guy even though he is dead so she puts flowers on an unmarked grave... fade to black"
1,"""I'm investigating cold creek Manor.""","I know that by the reviews above an d below that I'm on the same page as everyone else here. Believe these people. This movie is cinematic grabage at it's worst. First off, they misled everyone in the world into thinking that it was a horror movie which it is only a thriller. The acting is dopey. the plot is confusing and nothing ever makes any sense. The best way to describe this let down is : very short lived."
2,complete garbage with a good cast,"this movie, i missed at the theatre.thank god i only rented it thru net flix.i thought by the movie trailers it was a horror-ghost storeyinstead we get dennis quaid playing a coward movie makersharon stone, not lookin hot at all.stephen dorff...we already know his storey and motiveat the begiinning of the film.....it was suppose to be a "" who done it ""trouble is we already know !!!!!a women playing a elected sheriff ???????????anytime these canada film companies get a hold of a americanlaw enforcement officer they ruin it, wake up peopledo your home work !!!!if you have nothing else to do, then maybe watch this.hours on the play station would have been better.thats my 2c"
1,Did this movie suck or what?,"If asked to sum up this movie in a single word, what word to choose -- boring? bland? predictable? trite? So many to choose from. Save your money and do not bother to purchase this movie. It is a story we have all seen before (and done much better) of evil stalker after unknowing helpless people. Problem is you will not really care about the people or believe the bad guy's motives. It is a major disappointment considering how strong the cast is. But with such weak material, even a strong cast will make a real stinker. And that is exactly what happened here."
1,suhdididly-uck,wow this movie blowsssssssssssss with the fire of 1000 suns. how on earth did he piece the retainer and the tooth to meaning that the family was dead? i mean if i find a hotpocket and a sock on the porch does that mean my brother's dead?!! i seriously thought that it was going to be great by looking at the commercials. dont dont waist your money renting this flaming piece of crap.
1,Boring and predictable,"I expected a little more out of `Cold Creek Manor'. It had the potential to be a decent thriller. The plot is spine tingling, but then again it's executed so comically that it turns into a spoof before you have a chance to be scared. The script is full of corny dialog, clichéd sequences of events and predictable plot twists, and the direction by Mike Figgis is horrid. The acting for the most part is awful and don't get me started on the music which is so obnoxious it kills any ounce of tension. The snake scene alone is so over the top it made my laugh."
3,Cold creek manor,"I am always careful about films that skip the cinemas and go straight to DVD. Cold Creek Manor is one of those films (well, that's what happened in Australia). However, after reading the back cover, I decided it sounded ok particularly being a thriller.While its far from being original, it has some creepy moments. It also has some try hard scary scenes (ie. the snake scene), but I imagine a madman could do that sort of thing if provoked.Unfortunately, the movie proves that Sharon Stone is a rather ordinary actor, and while Dennis Quaid acts the same in all his roles, he is quite convincing as a man in danger.Cold Creek Manor is worthy of one viewing ... even if Stephen Dorff is annoying as the madman."
5,Very good reading,"I was excited to receive this book after I already read it in the native language of the author. Although the translation is a little bit clumsy, it still retains the mystery and the excitement of the love story. I love the reading and the book is in very good condition!"
3,I never found these so helpful.,I tried these because I traveled a lot while pumping. But I always felt saver rinsing in hot water if I could.
3,"great item, but I didn't really use them",I never really used this item. After pumping I would normally just go to the sink and rinse off my items and place them on a towel for next time. You could also just use baby wipes if your going to use a wipe. Just not what I needed personnaly.
3,Great idea but...,Great idea but it causes the parts to stick together almost like glue if they aren't completely dry when you reassemble.
4,Love this product!,They have made pumping way easier. I have a job that I don't get a lot of time to pump and this time saving product as made it more possible.
3,"Great concept, but....","I bought these for a road trip. Great concept but, I still needed water to get the milk from behind the valve (of course)so I did a cleaning w/ the wipes to keep from packing dirty supplies, but still stopped and rinsed the connector portion of the pump w/ water b/f using again. Great product for those who truly would not have much access to soap and water, but I found that I really didn't need them."
1,Check the ingredients,I just went to the store and compared the ingredients of this product to generic wipes (like Clorox wipes without bleach) and they have the same ingredients -- save your money!
4,great for on the run pump cleanings,"Recently traveled for a wedding, and these made cleaning the medela pump a breeze in various locations....airport bathroom, reception lounge, etc. Wondered, though, if the pump parts were getting as clean as a hand or dish wash. Highly recommend for away-from-home locations, though."
3,Convenient but pricey,"I like these wipes a lot, but they are pretty expensive for what you get. Seems like you could use any kind of wipe and get the same results...."
5,"Perfect for quick, private cleaning",I'm not a fan of needing to wash my pump accessories in our public bathroom or kitchen at work so these wipes have been a life-saver. I can usually get away with using the same wipe for cleanings about 3-4 hours apart. I'm looking forward to having these when travelling as well. Great-buy.
5,great product,this product is very good i love it how easy it is to clean the breast pump with no left over residue
2,Not Sure,"I am not sure what the difference is between these and other wipes... outside of the expense. It's not made with castile soap, and that seems like it would work better than these wipes. I was not comfortable enough with the cleaning power of these to use without thoroughly rinsing all pieces of my pump. I see how it seems easy, but now that I've tried these, they are pretty much a waste of money."
2,leaves residue of soap + breastmilk,"They are almost too wet, and leave a residue from the breastmilk. I wipe the parts as well as I can, but on the valve I always notice the sour milk smell by the end of the day. I have to bring a dry cloth to go over the parts after I clean them with the wipes."
4,Great for pumping at work!,"These are great wipes to use at work. They make pumping a little faster and more private (if you don't want to use the sink in a community setting for everyone to see your pumping equipment). One wipe cleans plenty, which is a good thing because the only down side to these wipes are the cost per wipe. They're worth it when you want privacy, but at home, just use the sink and save the money!"
5,Nice product for ease in cleaning....,"I have used this product for both my children (one who is now 3 and I pumped with her for at least 14 months) and now with pumping for my 5 month old. For a busy mom working full-time outside the home and having to pump, these are wonderful. I pump in the morning in my office and wipe down the pump shield and then pump in the afternoon and wipe it down before taking it home to fully clean. If you use lansinoh lanolin it cleans it off the pump shield even better then soap sometimes! I have recently decided that I will use the front of one wipe after the morning pump and the back on the afternoon pump (since I am really just wiping it off to take home and clean at that point) so I can conserve how many I use in a day to one instead of two....since the price is a little pricey.....great product and serves its purpose well! So helpful for the working mom!"
5,Works great,"I loved these wipes. Since I pumped every work day as a teacher for an entire school year in a restroom (that was rarely used by anyone else, thankfully), and I didn't have pump breaks that were long enough for me to wash the pump parts with soap and water, I found these wipes to be a lifesaver. I could quickly wipe down the parts after each use during the day time, the parts would quickly dry, allowing me to reassemble the parts at the end of a pump session instead of having to wait until the beginning of the next pump session. I washed my pump parts with soap and water or ran them through the dishwasher every night (I can't remember) to ensure that the parts remained clean. I will purchase these wipes again with my next child (who is due to arrive in March 2012)."
3,Way too expensive!!!,"I used these for months, 3-4 times per day while I was at work. They work well enough, but I was going through a pack in less than 8 work days. Too much $ in the trash. I spoke with my son's pediatrician who said I could use rubbing alcohol wipes instead. I was able to get a roll of 40 alcohol wipes in a cannister from the grocery store pharmacy for $1.99 each. Saved me a TON of $ over the 10 months that I pumped at work."
2,Not worth the money,"I really wish these wipes are what they are advertised to be, but to me they are just regular natural wipes packed for Medela and with a ridiculously high price."
3,Not for daily use,"I got these before I started back at work and was getting ready to pump three times a day. I think I've used 2 wipes in the package in a 6 month period. Although ""unscented"" - they do have a slight smell, and I feel like the wipes leave a bit of residue on the parts which made me uncomfortable using them frequently and without rinsing afterward (rendering them kind of useless). Personally I just quickly rinse my parts after each session, and then do a soap and water scrub at night every day. It works well for me. I guess I'm glad I have these as a ""just-in-case"" back-up, but definitely wouldn't recommend them for a daily solution."
5,Get these if you are pumping at work,"I'm so glad I discovered these wipes. Before, I would wash my pump parts in the one kitchen we have at work. After one too many run-ins with our CFO in the kitchen, I decided I need to find a way to clean the pump in the privacy of my mother's room. It is embarassing to try to hold a professional conversation with someone when they've caught you with phalanges drenched in your breast milk! These wipes are perfect. Also, as other reviewers have said, one wipe can last for more than one use, so even though they are a bit expensive, you can get your money's worth out of them."
4,Convenient but expensive,"This is a great way to quickly clean the pump parts when at work, but they clean the accessible areas only. There is no substitute for washing in running water and either steaming or running in the dishwasher every couple of days at least. They are kinda expensive though."
3,Expensive but work well,"I agree with some of the other users, you can find a cheaper solution. However, the wipes do not smell and work well in getting everything clean. I travel and am running around trying to keep up my milk supply so this works for everything that I need."
3,Beware only 1 shade in package,"You must order 2 kits if you need to provide shade for 2 car windows. I thought the word 'kit' implied that it contained everything I would need. Not so. I'll probably just order another one instead of having 2 different shades, but who would ever need just 1. Weird way to package this product in my opinion."
3,An ok product,This sunshade does the job it's intended to do but it is impossible to put up without bubbles and it does not cover the whole window of our Honda Accord. It does allow us to roll our window up and down without the shade from falling off. The light that comes through the shade is still fairly bright but I think it does decrease the intensity.
1,Not a perfect solution,"I really wanted to like this solution, who can say no to rolling down your window? I purchased the Lionheart because I read a review from another website that stated (incorrectly) that these shades were NOT folded and were in fact rolled to help with the application. Well this is incorrect. Another problem is the static/installation squeegee device. It is made of a hard plastic and it scratches the shade horribly. I also think that if it came with some sort of magic liquid like the protectors for phones/ipads that it would help keep the bubbles down and help it to adhere to the window better. I also agree with a previous poster that you should take some caution the first few times you try to change lanes or merge, it takes some getting use to."
5,Great Album - long live Lorraine Lewis!,"Amazing and only released album from Femme Fatale. Lorraine's voice is always on key, and the hooks make you want to dance. A second album 'Lady in Waiting' was rumoured to have been recorded but never released, and that's a shame. Along with Saraya's two albums, this one never leaves rotation on my iPod. Lorraine's 'Chains' on the soundtrack for the movie 'Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead' is awesome as well."
3,USB and PS/2 are not electrically compatible,"Okay, folks, here's the deal: USB and PS/2 are not electrically compatible. They're entirely different protocols and use different signaling on the wire. This adapter simply connects the plugs together; it does not do any signal conversion. So the only way an adapter like this can work is if your USB keyboard or USB mouse is prepared to recognize a PS/2 signal and internally change to using the PS/2 protocol. Many mice made circa 2000 to 2005 are designed to do this. Some newer USB mice are USB only. Most USB keyboards are USB only.It's like attaching a garden hose to a gasoline pump: While you might find an adapter to make the connection, that's not going to make water come out of the hose.If you buy this adapter expecting it to magically make any USB device work on a PS/2 port computer, you're going to be disappointed."
1,adapter,"my usb mouse works fine in the usb port, but would not work at all in the ps2 port using the adapter.. ps2 mouse works in ps2 port, so port is good. Windows XP. For the price, not worth returning it. tossed it in a drawer."
1,Terrible Product,"Simply put, this product does NOT work. It is a waste of money. However, it will cost more to send it back than the product is worth, which is $0!! I am surprised that this company would ship out worthless products being in the Amazon.com system. I would NOT buy this product. I am surprised they can't get something as simple as this to work. I hate that I have to give this product one star because it should be ZERO stars."
2,review order,"THE ITEM WAS EXACTLY WHAT I ORDERED, BUT IT DID NOT FIT MY COMPUTER.THE INFORMATION CAME FROM MY COMPUTER BUT IT WAS INCORRECT.THE DELIVERLY WAS QUICK AND PACKAGED VERY WELL.THANKS FOR THE GOOD SERVICE.CAROLYN"
1,Do Not Bother,"This product is useless. It simply does not work, it does not matter how many times you try or how many of them you try they simply don't work. So PLEASE don't bother, you will be wasting your money, like I did.PS/2 Male to USB Female AdapterUSB Keyboard To PS2 Port AdapterPS/2 Male to USB Female Adapter"
1,Does not fit,I had to send that to K&N for a refund. It says it will fit a 2003 5.3 v8 but it will not. Not enough cleanance between the fan and the goose neck of the new filter kit. K&N said not to use it.
5,The Master just gets better,"As time goes on, Tony Bennett just gets better...this album of is bound to be one of the signature recordings of his masterful career."
2,Disappointment!,"This is not what I wanted at all! I am a Spanish teacher, and wanted an informational but interesting and current DVD on Semana Santa in Spain. For $39.99 this is a rip off! It's clearly old footage, (though the date says 2004, it's clearly from the 90s)and doesn't even cover the processions in Sevilla- where they are the most popular! There are no options to have subtitles or anything to adjust the difficulty level for the level of students who are watching. I was bored stiff, I don't know how my students could focus and have any interest in this amazing celebration. What a disappointment!"
5,great product,this was hard for me to find and words really great for lthose of us still using older gear thanks
2,This video is clearly out of date,"Though Martin Heckelman is obviously an articulate and knowledgeable instructor, this video was produced before the introduction of shaped skis. So it fails to address the changes in technique that shaped skis have brought to the sport. In particular, one notices the emphasis on unweighing to release the old edges and begin the new turn. In addition, when describing making parallel turns, Martin frequently has a wedge entry to his demonstration turns. This too is clearly an technique that predates shaped skis."
1,This is a very disappointment,"Since I'm totally new with Flash and its manual isn't helpful. I thought buying this book would help me get through with Flash. But my first tutorial with it was a disaster. The software command was listed wrong, instructions were completely confusing as hell. I felt like an idiot for buying this book. My advice to you is not to waste your money."
5,Awesome,I am a residential contractor and this vac is a professional grade vac. It has powerful suction and was used to clean up drywall dust at a new home site. We had abosultely NO problems with it. I have never had a vac that would do this. This one does! I will buy another if I need more than one in the future.
2,Worked great while it worked.,This unit has worked great for the first couple of years. Then this year the small fan blade on the end of the motor shaft fell off allowing it to over heat and melt the housing that the moter sits in. I ordered a new motor for 75 dollars and installed it. the problem is... now that the housing is melted it doesn't give enough air flow thru the unit to keep it cool so after 5 minutes of running It starts smelling like melted plastic. I have to shut it down and let it cool every 5 minutes. By the time you buy a new motor and housing you might as well buy a whole new unit. jz
2,Love=Less Ash 16004QV 16 gallon,I read all the wonderful reviews for this vacuum. I am so disappointed with it. It does not seem to be any different then my old shop vac.I love not this loveless vacuum.
1,Disappointed in quality,"I was a bit disappointed in the quality of this book. Many places are hard to read, as the printing is so light and so distorted. I almost sent it back, but didn't want to go through the hassle. I have seen this book in print before and that copy was of much better quality. The pictures of this book were pretty good, so I kept it mainly for them."
4,Blisters!,"My daugher loved the look of these. However, they are very stiff and she has the blisters to prove it!"
2,"Just wanted to add, that sometimes this runs too fast","What an odd clock. For me, it's gaining about two hours a day, so it seems like this clock's timepiece is way off -- as it runs slow for others. No one at my hardware store had ever even heard of a battery-operated clock running fast.I'm going to ask LaCrosse Customer Service for a new timepiece movement, we'll see how that goes."
1,"LAME, LAME & LAME!!",At first I thought it was okay. I'd put it in my kitchen so I didn't notice the noise right away. Then it started getting off track with time and now it's so far off I can't even use it. I live in Las Vegas and I don't really need a clock to tell me the air is dry but according to this thing the air is practically normal and it's always 80 degrees (I wish!) Of course I've tried changing the batteries about 3 times within a 6 month period and then realized it's just the clock. Someone mentioned the fact that it's not real metal - which is true - it's plastic painted with silver metallic paint. As I sit here I notice how the seconds hand seems to keep ticking like it should be working and yet it never says the correct time no matter how many times I re-set it. Don't waste your money buying one of these.
1,Inaccurate,I have one but am replacing it because it loses time and there seems to be no way to adjust it.
1,Not worth the postage to return it,"I knew it was cheap, but this clock is really CHEAP. It broke before the box was thrown away. The hour hand got caught under the temp hand. I took it apart and fixed it but it shouldn't have broken with in the week. Buy at your own risk."
1,Not worth the little I paid for it,"I bought this clock for my kitchen....I enjoy baking, and when making bread temperature and humidity levels matter. These dials both work fine. However, this clock can not keep time. It was constantly falling behind. I thought it was the batteries, so I put new ones in, but that did not help.This clock is made out of very cheep plastic. I had it on a screw in the wall, and after about a month, on a cold night the hanging part cracked and the clock fell and the face covering shattered.This clock is great in theory, but really isn't worth buying for any reason."
2,Very Accurate But Very very very Noisy. Tick Tock Tick Tock Tick Tock,"Keep time very very accurately but you need to install it aleast 20-30 feet away from bedroom. I am not that sensetive to clock tick...tock but this one is an exception. Humidity and termometer also works fine. I guess you get what you paid for. I purchase this in Oct. 2008Update 1 (March 04, 2011): The clock is still extremerly accurate and still :) very very very noisy (Tick tock tick tuck...........................)Update 2 (April 13, 2012): Does not keep the time accurately. Even after i changed the battery twice, still going slow. That ends this clock's life. RIP."
2,Very loud,"Pros: It is cheap and displays time, humidity and temperature.Cons: It is extremely loud. The ticking is so noisy that I had to remove it from two rooms. The product description said ""Metal Wall Clock"", so I expected the outer ring to be metal; in fact, it is plastic with metallic paint. No visible part is made from metal. However, the plastic looks fine.Bottom line: you get what you pay for."
1,bad product,"It is loud, it is plastic and absolutely not metal, and it goes behind 5 mn every week or so!"
1,not precise and too noisy,The clock fell 3 hours behind in 10 days and the tick-tack sound is too loud.
2,cheaply made,didn't really work as described and used batteries quite fast. definately not a quality product
2,Mixed results - waste of time and money,"I have bought 4 of these now. Two are working well, the other two will not keep time. The clock does have some nice features, but I won't buy another one.Pros: very easy to read dial. The humidity and temperature gauges are nice.Cons: purchased 4 now. Two are not working. Amazon is accepting returns."
1,bad purchase,"The first one arrived broken, the second one broke within days of putting it up, and the third one lasted about two months before it randomly stopped working (fresh batteries didn't help). We've left it up in the spare room and get a kick out of seeing what time it displays since every so often it will start working for a few hours before conking out again.Skip it, unless you enjoy taking it down every few days to try and motivate it to work again."
1,Never Worked,Clock is made of cheap plastic. It never worked. The second hand got stuck under the minute hand and would not reset. I should have expected this for $15.00. it's not even worth sending back for refund. I'm going to throw it away and buy a different clock.
4,Its interesting,I bought this book at a Church Supply shop. I was interested to find out That it was written by a Catholic priest like one reviewer stated though the author neglected to put this on the cover. This book is also available at other bookshops in new age and metaphysics sections. Im glad I bought it but Its not one I would go back to time and time again.
5,gothic metal at its best,"This is an incredible album. Dawn Crosby died of alcoholism, I believe in 1996. Anyway, my first exposure to this was an intense video ""Betrayed,"" one of the most intense tracks off this album. The overlay of voices throughout the album makes it sound as though a wall of hanting female banshees laid down the vocals. Far superior to the harsher, stripped down follow-up, this evokes early Danzig and early King Diamond, yet is a wonder all to its own. Very under-exposed and under the radar... get it if you can."
4,Noticeable improvement,"After 10 days of using this twice per day the very fine lines around my eyes are less noticable, and the area around my eyes looks firmer and more youthful. It's not a complete miracle by any means, but as someone who is generally quite skeptical of cosmetic company claimes, I am quite pleased with the performance of this product. Plus, it's a great price!"
5,great!,"My daughter bought this at a discount store for half the price it sells for and she absolutely loves it. It really does make lines disappear. She is only 23, so she doesn't have many lines to begin with but this cream helps to keep her skin young."
1,Why won't these work?,"Looking at these, you would think that they should work well, but they don't. They have no clamping tension and cannot be tightened enough to hold anything firmly. If you need a clamp that fits loosely, these will work. My recommendation is to keep looking for another product."
1,Broke right away,"I bought this clamp for a specific project. When I went to clamp the pieces together, the clamp broke. I did not even get ONE use out of it."
2,Useful for what?,"I needed a tool to close some very difficult snaps on a window treatment. The yellow doobers on the end of the fingers swivel, so that when I went to secure the snap they swiveled upward and away from, and off the snap. It proved useless. Had they been stationary, it would have worked."
3,Not for heavy clamping,"These clamps have their use but they are not built for a heavy clamping project. I still use them as light clamping and as temporary ""holding"" use but definately not a clamp for glueing where you need a tight not slipping hold."
4,"Great for a Variety of Projects: Metal, Plastic, Wood","These clamps are great for a variety of projects that require quick and easy stabilization of materials. Much more than for woodworking, the Irwin Quick-Grip are great for clamping 1/4"" polycarbonate sheet where holes need to be drilled through the entire stack. The same situation arises with stacked metal plates where a quality vise is not available. As other reviewers have mentioned, the one-hand operation is great for quick application of glue, especially for the type that expands. Use of Gorilla Glue often requires such clamps because the expansion force pushes apart the two pieces to be fused. The low cost of these clamps suggests that avid hobbyists and DYI home repair types purchase these clamps before they are needed.ProsFast single motion with single hand, no screws or secondary flip clampsConsNo precision control of clamp force"
1,Clamps that do not hold,"1 star is too many if you want to use these as clamps!I have a set of these clamps that I bought thinking they looked handy. They are handy, but if you want them to hold something in place you can not let go of the grips. Every time I have used them I want to squeeze them to one more notch on the ratchet. So far I have not found a good use for these clamps except to keep extension cords coiled and separate."
1,too little clamping pressure,"I thought these would replace my spring clamps, which are sometimes too strong for small jobs. However, the Handi-Clamps don't provide enough clamping pressure. I returned mine. I would recommend the Quick-Grip bar clamps, they are just as quick to use and can provide a large amount of clamping pressure. I use them on almost every project."
1,"Good concept, poor execution","I have had two of these clamps for a few years now. They are as easy and convienient to use as the positive reviews describe, yet I hardly ever use them. They simply won't retain enough clamping pressure for most uses. As soon as I release the handles, about 80%-90% of the pressure disappears. Since basic spring clamps are just as easy to use, hold better and are much less expensive, I see no reason to buy this clamp. If I lost mine, I don't think I would ever miss them."
3,a good clamp with limitations,"I found this unit to be a clamp with limited specific usefulness. It works well with veneers and held small pieces of wood to be worked. There was too little clamping force to keep large pieces of wood from shifting. It does not have the strength of hold that one finds with a metal c-clamp. To fit my need, I purchased an additional two deep metal c-clamps."
1,I must have gotten a lemon.,Within a couple of weeks my clock suddenly started to speed up until it was more than 10 hours ahead of the actual time. I tried resetting it to see what would happen but the clock just did it again.Since there are so many rave reviews for this clock it makes me wonder if mine was just a lemon or if there are others out there doing the same thing but no one has bothered to write a review.
2,Color is not white,"I received the clock and I don't know if the one I received was discolored or not. I spoke with the company I purchased it from and sent pictures and they instantly sent a refund. The night light on front was very bright white, which made the color on top and sides look like a light tan or cream with a brown tint. Now that I look at the photos you can see the color difference. For some this might not matter, but my decor in my room is bright white and putting this next to all of that you could really tell a difference."
2,carol wior bodysuit with waist cincher,"It does what it says, but in order to get it on you have to pull the material over your hips or over your head (shoulders), which therefore stretches the material that is small enough for your waist out. I don't think it will be in good shape for much longer because it is stretching out fast."
3,Carol Wior Bodysuit,I have only worn this once. It did not do what I expected from it. It was lose on me and I could have done without buying it.
5,Awesome Product,"I ordered these about 2 months ago, from another supplier on Amazon. And at the time I had a rather large bald area on the top of my head. Since taking these, that area has gotten smaller, and there is a lot of new growth in that area as well. Not a lot in the lenght department, but I know that will come in time, the main thing is filling in that bald area. So this product is worth it, when I originally ordered it I got 4 bottles to give a long time to see if it works. IT DOES!"
4,sharp knife,I bought this knife as a gift for a friend's wife. She shot a deer and gutted the thing out with this knife. It was remarkably sharp. In my hands the knife would have been a little small but it worked great for her.
1,Shipping problems... TWICE!!,"The table actually looks as if it would be great... if it would ever arrive in one piece. Amazon had two tries at shipping this table to me. The first one arrived completely smashed. The box looked as if it had been handled by a clamp truck. I returned it and Amazon was good about shipping another one promptly, but this one too, arrived in unusable, unsalvageable condition. The problem seems to be that Bosch does not package the table with enough protection for shipping and UPS handles it like they are in a Samsonite commercial. I ended up canceling the order. Very disappointing, since I have not seen the table offered at any local dealers."
4,"Great Table, Cheap Parts","This is a good router table and very sturdy. Its worked well for me and I would buy it again. I am however not satisfied at all with the way that the mounting plate works. Its hard to align and the cheap plastic set screws that they provide are terrible. Bosch needs to fix two things to make this table really great. Get rig of the cheap plastic set screws, and make the way you align and set the fence easier than having to reach under it all the time to move the knobs. The height is very comfortable and it was easy to set up and build."
2,Baby Ben Alarm Clock,"Normally, in years past, this clock has been a staple in American homes, and greatly applauded. However, although this item was advertized as being made in the U. S., I found it was Made in China, and the quality was poor, and it was difficult for me to dial the time knobs. It was a sorry purchase."
1,Unusable Due to Poor Workmanship,"It is extremely hard to wind up and doesn't keep good time. I gave this to my Dad as a Christmas gift and he couldn't get it to work and brought it back to me. Don't know if the return deadline passed, but I'll return it if I can and won't get another. Very poor quality. It is a shame the quality has fallen so far. His old one worked reliably for over 10 years which is why he wanted another baby ben. This one didn't work at all."
2,Not like it used to be.,"Bought this clock hoping it was like the one I had years ago. It wasn't. Though it looked the same, the weight of it was different and I could tell easily that it had been cheapened. Now made somewhere else, it didn't keep time as well and didn't sound the same. It also was much lighter and tipped over easily. I wouldn't buy it again."
1,Green Clock Shown but Gold Received,"This picture shows a green framed clock with a dark brown face. This seller only shows the picture and does not state the color in the description. I assumed I would be getting a green clock. I received a bright gold clock with a light brown face. I emailed the seller about this and was told that I had received the correct item. The seller also pointed out that they had not said anything about color in the listing, as if that made it alright. While the gold clock is very nice, it's not what is pictured. I don't have gold colored things in my house and I do not appreciate being stuck with it. I would advise anyone considering this clock to find out for sure what color they will be getting before ordering."
2,A boring bore and even more of the same!,"Oh, boy! This is an interesting but unfortunately FAILED experiment. This long pseudo-artsy ""documentary"" provides nothing more than a series of shots of Gaudí's buildings presented with an annoying electronic background music which sounds like it belongs in a cheap thriller. There is NO commentary, although buildings are labelled at times. Judging by cars in the streets, it's a rather old material. Most of my students in a Spanish art class were either annoyed, bored, or fell asleep during the viewing of this material. On the positive side, the DVD format lets one access just one building at a time -- in small doses it may be more palatable."
4,Could have been better,"This is a thorough look at Gaudi's work in Barcelona, with hauntingly beautiful music as it's backdrop (very little dialogue). It has some interesting extras but does not include an early film of Gaudi's work (by Ira Latour) which would have made it a definitive compilation of Gaudi films."
1,Very disappointed,"This 2 DVD set is a mess. I kept sending it back, one was in Japanese or wouldn't play at all and the other had almost no dialogue, just spanning around the city you didn't know what they were showing. I found it impossible and ended up returning it. I recently returned from Barcelona and this beautiful work deserves a much better showing."
4,Pretty Good Product,"I received the pads and have been using them off and on for my blepharitis and it has worked pretty well. However, it you want to have ""blurry free"" eyes you should use it again in the evening and I just don't have the money to keep buying a lot of the pads."
2,not for Avent bottles,"While the concept overall seems like a good idea, it is not for everyone. If your life is hectic and/or disorganized (like me!), this is not for you, because you need to make sure to boil water and then place the warmer in for 15 minutes (which means remembering to start the whole process 20-30 minutes before you leave the house).The other big thing that I didn't see in any of the reviews was that this does not work for Avent bottles. I tried with a 4 oz bottle but the warmer was too small and there was no way to fit the bottle and warmer in the bag."
4,Great for baby food,"I've used this mainly for warming baby food(stage 3). It has worked great since I know when my child's mealtime is going to start. I just activate the warmer with the baby food jar wrapped in it about 15-20 minutes in advance, then it's nice and warm when mealtime begins. Sure you could immerse it in a cup of hot water but I didn't want to rely on how fast the food server can come back with it after requesting it at the restaurant. Just don't let the warming pack freeze because mine broke after I left it in the car overnight on a really cold night(less than 20F)."
2,O.K. warmer,"This bottle warmer is terrible, however; the electric warmer I bought for the car was worse. The one I bought for the car took about 45 minutes to get a bottle warmed, and you also had to be in the car the whole time with it plugged up. This particular bottle warmer works in 30-45 minutes. (depending on how cold the bottle is to start with, of course) So, it's better than the standard plug-in type when you're on the go because you don't have to keep it plugged in. If you have a predictable enough baby, you can just start warming about 30 minutes before you think your baby will be hungry. If you don't have a predictable baby, you can get stuck with a very angry baby for a very long time. I believe, in the end, that going to a drive thru and asking for a half-full cup of hot water, and placing the cold bottle inside (all restaurants are happy to oblige - even without a purchase) is still the best method! (ready in less than 10 minutes)"
4,Takes a little while...,"Even though this warmer takes a little while to fully heat a bottle it stays warm for a couple of hours without over heating it. I just fill a bottle with the amount of water I will need and break the activating seal about 45 minutes- 1 hour before I know when my baby will want to eat. Even if he sleeps through his feeding or doesn't want a bottle right when he wakes up, I can count on it keeping the water warm. And I just add the formula powder when he is ready. So granted it takes it's time heating up, I would assume that most moms know when their baby will want to eat (especially by 2 months old). What do you expect from something that you can't plug in? It's called on-the-go for a reason. Even car adapter warmers take a long time. Just work out a schedule and this warmer is great."
3,Wait for the good parts.,"Good 1st person account of the American WWII recapture of Guam. Too often memoir writers can't differentiate between what will or will not be interesting to the casual reader. But especially for Guam denizens, when they get to Kwajaleen, Chuuk, towards the Northern Marianas it gets much more exciting."
4,Worth it,"Though I had the impression there would be more ""action"" out of the dogs remembered in this writing, it was still an interesting read for anyone that respects and admires what dogs can do for humans in the line of service. Certainly no regrets with the purchase."
4,better than I expected,"This book is well written. I didn't know Marines could write. (That's a joke, jarhead.) If you are a dog person, you will like this book. I would give it five stars, but I'm saving that for 'Life and Fate'."
5,A MUST READ BOOK,This book is great!! A must read for all people to remember whatdogs did for our country. The dogs may not know what they did. But we can. I was really moved by this book.
2,Poorly written. A great disappointment.,The topic of threesomes conjures up a natural interest in many of us. This book however is terribly written. It uses germane examples and the research done uses little supporting proof. A very great disappointment. Do not waste your time reading this.
5,I should buy this stuff by the case...,"I have battled recurrent athlete's foot for lo these twenty years and have tried everything--washing my feet in Lysol, bleach, vinegar, sulfur, Listerine; covering them in Vick's, Bag Balm, Tiger Balm, and every tolnaftate/clotrimazole/miconazole product on the market. Being in and out of various dojos and gyms and going barefoot a lot of the time means you get nasty stuff on your feet! This stuff works better than anything I've tried.I wash my feet morning and night with tea tree oil soap and apply this lotion, and I've been able to get rid of the cracking, peeling, itching, and dryness that plagued me for so long. Very effective and you don't need a lot, so this is a pretty economical solution too. The smell is a bit medicinal but I don't mind it, and it washes right off."
1,rubbish,"Got this because the tolnaftate cream I used to get was discontinued. That stuff worked. This one (clearly a different formula--color, smell, texture) didn't do a danged thing. Ringworm spread like crazy, had to go to the doc & get a prescription Med.Might just be coincidental timing, but my one experience with this product was profoundly disappointing."
3,not sure...,just started using this lotion for itchy skin. it does makes my skin feel smoother but the itching is still a problem.
3,From Back Cover,"Tracker Darin Shakir worked alone. The mysterious Cattleman's Club member had been burned in the past and he wasn't about to see innocents hurt on this mission. But plans had gone awry - he'd wound up injured, and in bartender Fiona Powers's capable hands. The feisty redhead was more than a match for this brooding sheikh and insisted on helping Darin. But his temporary, sexy new partner was a very tempting distraction Darin didn't want, even as he yearned to show Fiona the fiery attraction blazing inside.6th in The Texas Cattleman's Club: The Stolen Baby series"
2,teacher liked it students did not,I had hoped this video would inspire my high school science students. It was boring to most of them. I liked it myself.
4,second review,"I gave a real harsh review of my loveless orinally .But to get better suction i removed one of the filters .it still not loaded with suction But ; it is dustless and does real nice for drywall .hook it to my power tools also .smoked two other vac doing this but doesn't seem to bother the loveless.not buying filters ,just wash these if needed .so in perspective it does alright .i have a 50$ sears one for general cleanup.oh and mine has never popped a breaker ."
2,Save your money...,"The vacuum works very well and, for very small projects - and with a lot of practice - the sander works, BUT - it is very hard to use and it sands slowly. If you have to keep the dust to a minimum, it works, but I would just put up a dust screen and sand by hand and, if possible use a window fan or negative air machine. This is a great idea not well executed, although it does seem well-made for what it's worth. And if you really want one after reading this, mine is available for a very short song. Jay"
4,Great vintage artwork for Halloween-ists!,"A small collection of Halloween related postcards. It could have used a few more in it, but its ok for the price."
2,Halloween: Romantic Art and Customs Of Yesteryear Postcard B,"Customs?...what customs? This is just a collection of tear-out postcard reprints with no comments, far less writing, to go along with them. On top of that, none of the ""notable"" ones are shown (Schmucker, Clapsaddle, etc.). Another ""why did I buy this?"" item to put on the shelf."
3,Too advanced for students learning spanish,"For native spanish speakers this is a great book, with a great story and interesting characters. However, for english speakers learning spanish, the text is extremely difficult to translate, with a massive new vocabulary to learn. Only get this if your spanish is extremely advanced."
1,El capitán Alatriste,"This sounds like a wonderful book, HOWEVER it would be nice if you also offered German, or English Translation."
4,I like it but I don't...,"This is for advanced beginners to intermediates because it does move fast and there are NO alignment cues.What I found to be uncalming: the instructors count during all poses. They had the perfect opportunity to cue instead of saying one...two...three...four...The counting made me a little aggravated during the practice. They could just say, ""take 5 breaths.""If you know how to do the poses correctly already, then it's ok not to have alignment cues, although they are always useful.The practice is just under an hour and there are some nice sequences. They talk a bit rushed because they try to say a lot about being a vegetarian and Earth and other stuff...but no cues.Overall, I would choose the music only option next time to avoid the counting because I did feel peaceful when the practice was finished. Also, the music was cool and that Michael Franti isn't too tough on the eyes either :)Buy it if you already know how to perform the basic poses well."
4,great dvd-cheap product,"I think its a great dvd if you are intermediate to advance, but the quality is bad. After the 3rd use, it is now cracked in half from putting it in the DVD case and I'm always really careful."
4,What a find!,"I bought LP this at a small record store at a small town thinking that I'd never seen this on CD before. Well, it really rocks and I was really impressed. Definetly will play this one again, and I'm glad I have a good hifi record player."
2,What Are You Smoking Dirk,"This album is OK, VERY MELLOW . It does not have Jon Lord or Cozy Powell,Lance Dixon Keys, Micky Underwood Drums.Exactly What Are You Smoking Dirk D. Bad Review D.D"
2,Copied form a VHS tape...,"Hoping for a better release in the near future, until then this copy will do..."
5,I just love these comic documentaries,"I don't know why I enjoy these type of documentaries, but I do. This compilation is quite good. I also enjoy The Four Clowns which I can't seem to locate."
5,Great History of a central Idaho Ranch,"The Gilmore Ranch story is Hal Miller's account of his experiences in one of central Idaho's best kept secrets. He was a young man in the late 30's when he came to Gilmore Ranch at the suggestion of a friend. He returned each year, and eventually bought the ranch with some college friends. Educated as a Forester and Bioligist, he embodied the spirit of the time - tough, adventurous, and keenly attached to God's creation. He tells the story of the original Gilmore brothers whom he met. He weaves tales from memory that paint an accurate picture of a time long vanished. I too had the pleasure of visiting and hunting the Gilmore Ranch in the summer of 2007. It is now a privately guided gem in the woods, with very limited hunting available. Great read, a remarkable place to visit."
1,Not for the Family,"If you do not wish to view eroticism and sex, this film is not for you. The story may be considered a classic, but this one is highly graphic."
2,SMALL ISLAND,iT WASN'T RATED. I ONLY WATCH G AND PG MOVIES. YOU NEED TO SHOW THE RATING SO I WON'T WASTE MY MONEY. THANK YOU
1,Small Island (Masterpiece Theater),"I did not care for this type of movie, it was slow and very drawn out. Just not for me."
3,What?,Just left the viewer hanging with many unanswered questions. Started out to be a good story but never really developed or went anywhere. A bit of a disappointment.
5,Small Island (Masterpiece Theatre),"Really good story done in Masterpiece Theater style, so you know it's going to be good. Very enjoyable for sure!"
5,Early work by an American master.,"Ezra Pound said there are three kinds of poets: innovators, masters, and those who do more or less good work in the style of the times. Pound considered himself an innovator, but sometimes seemed to long to be a master. Hugo is a definite master. I was one of his many students, so may be accused of bias. However, It is a bias that predates my study with him; that's what drew me to his workshops at U on Montana."
3,Don't look here for 'solutions',"This is the first of Dr. Tannen's books I've read, so I don't know how it compares to the others (oh, fooey--there I go with a qualifying statement!!) but I kept finding myself thinking, 'so what do we DO about it?!' The book is extremely well written and noted, but it gets really depressing to page through countless examples of women's handicaps in business-speak without some relief. There are a few warnings about trying to alter one's style to 'fit in,' but no hints, no clues, no steps to take to extinguish, if not reverse, current behavior. This is not to say it isn't good reading, just not what I'd hoped to find."
2,A disappointment but still relevant book,I have read Deborah Tannen's first 2 books and I found them groudbreaking and very informative. This book however seems to be too much of a rehash of her first 2 books with a little bit of business communication stuck in the middle. I was disappointed by the book and believe there are better books out there than this one.
2,"Lots of information, but what do I do about it?","I read this for a leadership program that I'm in, hoping to find a better way to communicate with my peers and supervisors. Instead, I found many examples of what's wrong with very few examples of what's right. Tannen is a good writer, but I found this book to be lacking solid guidance for communication needs."
2,"interesting, however not useful","I listened to the audio book version of this book. At first, it seemed quite refreshing to know men and women were so different that you could explain in your work environment why people behaved like that. However, it just didn't give any solution and keep saying it over and over again in this book can bore anyone.This book is more like a psychology paper rather than a practical handbook. The person who performed the book makes it more disturbing.In one word, from this book, you will understand that people are so different that you can't expect others will think like you. Men are more hierachical and women are nice and think all men are equal. My understanding is that even if it is like this, you can only be yourself."
2,Disappointing,She raises so many issues and offers no way of dealing with them. A professor of linguistics should know that people want to know more than just the issues. She needed more research for the book esp. about how people deal with such issues effectively.
2,A 1970's Viewpoint of Women Today,"I had hoped women had progressed more than Tannen implies. Of course the relationship between men and women is still not perfect, but whenever there are differences, you will have imperfection. Tannen's examples are dated and her observations of women stereotypical. She frequently cites studies, but does not reference the situation or the dates of research.I was very disappointed. I used this book in one of my graduate level organizational communications class. It certainly lead to a lengthy discussion. The students were angry at the lack of ""current"" information and the stereotyping."
5,Use it every day in my outpatient clinic,"I don't even think about prescribing antibiotics without referring to sanford's. It's cheap, well organized, current, and easy to carry around. One of the 2 or 3 most used tools I have in my practice."
5,This volume is out rated only by the experience of a day spent at Versailles.,A lovely volume of extraordinary photographs and historical information. The day I was so lucky to spend in the buildings and gardens of Versailles comes alive as I regard this lovely book.
1,Don't waste your money!,"Put one bulb in a nightlight, it didn't even last one month. Hasn't been 2 weeks on the second bulb but will comment if it also ""blows"" after 24 days."
2,"OK light, but short life","Each of this pack of four bulbs, turned on only at night for eight hours, lasted only a bit less than two months each. This is ridiculous, next time I will pay more for a name brand and hope for longer life"
4,Great for the price.,"This repeats earlier reviews. I have replaced one only after 3 months in a nightlight. That is less than the more expensive, but for the price they make great spares."
5,Acura replacement PCV Valve,Quality construction and works. Beck Arnley is always quality despite the fact that they contract a lot of their product building to other companies.
1,Very Disappointing.,"This is the last time I buy a map online. Unless I have it in my hands to look at it, I am not trusting online descriptions. I bought this map because it indicated in its cover that it shows the points of interest in St. Augustine. What it really shows is the coastal area around St. Augustine. The so called points of interest are little black dots with microscopic labels. I was hoping that it would have a separate section with the historical area of St. Augustine with the attractions clearly labeled and on a bigger scale as many other city maps do. There is no such thing in this map."
5,Dance at it's best,This a fantastic song. I love it even though I hate most Dance Music. Groove Terminator in an excellent DJ.
4,Be Perfect,"A very interesting book, but the Author is above my head. It was hard to read and understand, and I had to go over the same things again and again. I recommend it to anyone who can really take time to read and take it all in - someone who can understand quicker than I can. Not for a ""new"" Christian, as it is too deep."
1,"HTC Mobile Base for Jet 17"" Drill Press","The picture displayed for the HSO-593 does not match up with what the actual drill press mobile base looks like. I was hoping that the previous reviewer, Norman Cumings from College Station, TX USA, was overly critical of this base. However, after putting it together, I couldn't agree more about it being totally unstable. I am waiting for the UPS truck to pick it up and take it back."
3,Bolting it to the base makes a difference,"I followed M. Prigge's review advice about bolting the drill to the base. It's not too hard to do and I only had to invest a couple of dollars in bolts, nuts and washers. However for the cost of the base it should certainly be included. It makes a noticeable difference. Like M. Prigge suggests, this machine has its inherent problems given its top heavy. There is only so much HTC can do. It would be interesting to see what it would be like with 4 wheels instead of 3, 2 fixed and 2 swivels. That might make it a little more solid.I considered the HTC 2000 universal base given the considerable cost difference but with its design and the hole locations on the drill it wouldn't allow you to bolt the drill to the base.I'm giving it 3 out of 5 stars."
4,Nice selection of Lucaffe products,"Lucaffe is good, but Laxazza is better. The all-Columbian Lucaffe pods are the highlight of this package."
1,"a scholarly work, absolutely unreadable","I suppose the fault for why I didn't read past the second page lies with Amazon.com, for not categorizing the book as a SCHOLARLY work, rather than a book written for a wider audience. Of course, if the publisher had provided ""look inside"" capability....I might also add, there are scholars and there are scholars. Physical scientists' works are usually much more readable, even if you're not of their particular group of scientists, but social scientists are plainly awful, with their notes(1) interrupting everywhere, forcing you to jump not only to the bottom of the page but usually several pages forward to see whatever the author though was so important you should be interrupted, but couldn't quite manage to write into the text.Dennis R Mac CaskiePhD (Geology)1. Notes are an arrogant assumption of superiority over the reader and should be absolutely limited to no more than one, every other page, at the absolute maximum."
5,Another great gift,This is the second Gerger tool I have bought my husband. The last Gerber I bought him lasted 10 years with everyday use! He loves this Gerber and all it's uses.
2,The Gerber 600 is much better,"I bought this for my boyfriend and promptly returned it. I was getting it for him to replace his lost 600. The things that we did not like about this tool were:1) cheesy black grippy things that looked like they were going to come off if wet, and2) you can't do the cool thing where you hold the multitool, flick your wrist, and the pliers extend with a satisfying little snap!It's also a bit larger than the 600, so unless you have big pockets or don't care about size, you might want to go for the more compact 600."
2,"Mostly Good, But Barely","There have already been some excellent and extensive reviews, so I have little to add. Although this tool is solidly constructed, I find it too bulky to carry, yet not bulky enough to alow the screwdrivers to be easily pried out. The saw is rather useless (another blade should be included), and while the scissors seemed strong, the weld holding the spring to the blade broke without extensive or intensive use. I consider these major flaws and would not recommend purchase--unless the price falls below $20."
3,"Good, but.... it sure could be a lot better","Strengths: Seems to be a tough, well built tool.Carbide wire cutters work well and are replaceable.Weaknesses: Big and bulky with not many functions.Pliers opening is TINY, much less than Leatherman Juice or the regular size Leatherman tools (supertool, original, etc).I did some heavy knife cutting and tool hurt my hand through gloves. A big, expensive tool should have should have smoothly contoured edges.While the scissors cut well, their shape and accessibility could be better.After spending this much, I'd like to have an awl and tweezers.I'm not certain my money was well spent. Leatherman supertool has served me well in past and might still be better. I can hope that plier pivot on this tool holds up better than Leatherman."
2,"Good or slow,you pick.","I am a high school student and I had to pick a book to do a report on.I decieded to read ""A Farewell to Arms.""My report is due tomorrow and so far I am only on page 171.The book moves so slow and it is very dry.The plot is interesting,but Hemingway needed to add more to it,in order to keep the readers attention.I personally would not have picked this book to read if I knew that it was going to be this dry and boring."
2,What happened?,"As a Hemingway fan, imagine my surprise when I couldn't make it through this book. The characters were so completely unsympathetic that even Hemingway's writing couldn't save it."
1,This book was a waste of time and endlessly boring,I'm a junior in high school in an AP English class. (sophmore level college class) It was pointless and I couldn't get past the first 20 pages. What a snooze! Even the cliff notes were dull. I've been online for hour to get some help for my test tomorrow.
2,this book was very poor in its writing style and content,A Farewell to Arms was a weak structure of a book. I disliked the short sentences and choppy phrases. This resulted in a lack of fluid ideas and recognizable thoughts. The storyline was also void of any feeling or substance.
3,A self-portrait - thinker,A wonderful self indulging and revealing piece from the author. Better as it went. An easy read that gets your head thinking before its over. What's this all about? Hemingway?! I enjoyed it.
1,Not what I hoped for.,"I expected a book of poems that helped to teach the top 35 word families would have a vocabulary that was more in line with K-2 readers. Many of these poems will not be within the reading ability of children who are learning word families. I was promised many examples of the word families in each poem. Many of them only have a few family words, certainly not enough to help emergent readers gain any practice, especially with the higher vocabulary used through out the rest of the poem. Some of the poems are delightful, but on the whole, I was dissapointed with the book."
1,Know what you're paying for--- 15 minutes long,"Although this video is educational and interesting, it is only 15 minutes long. Great for students in a class, but not for home viewing on the subject of Christmas traditions in Spain. They could have done so much more with it. Way too expensive for what it is!"
3,Seems A Bit Too Politically Correct,I personally feelV'Da Mah SheTashiv: Know What To Answer (To Missionaries) A Thorough Jewish response To Missionariesis the book for Jews to get to see why Jews can not believe in Jesus (or Yeshua). I feel when you write a book to present the Jewish side yet say it is meant to make Christians more comfortable in their OWN religion it sounds too 'politically correct'. Meaning either the Jewish defense is not solid in it or there is overt patronizing to make Christian readers comfortable with it.
3,"judaism is not a religion, it's politics","I really did not read mr. jacob's book, but I exort him to try to understand the teachings of jesus better. Everything the jews are doing nowadays is to believe the lies of the antichrist and reject the truth of jesus. That's ok, it is a world wide phenomenon. If the jews continue to be so mortally ashamed of the crucifixion, they will find no salvation. Jesus is calling you to repentance for two thousand years, and you still don't understand, or are ashamed to do so. That's a horrible mistake, because jesus forgives even the worst sinners if they really repent and receive baptism. You jews, have to look to the past to find the messiah, not to the future. Once you accept jesus you will also understand the law, that you don't understand. The law alone is no good thing, because we human beings are incapable of observing its commandaments. Only the grace of God is capable of saving us and giving us life eternal. Shalom."
1,More Loshan Hara from Neussner,"Unfortunately, like his disappointing attack on Rabbi Steinsaltz, Mr Neussner tries to be controversial (and therefore jack up his book sales) by setting up a straw man -in this case the Sermon on the Mount- and declares Y'shua's Torah to be insufficient. Alas, he could have actually chosen to look at all of Jesus' reported words as a body of work, rather than peering through a keyhole (of a single short collection of teachings) and declaring that only what he saw was all there is. Neussner's technique seems to repeat itself endlessly from Steinsaltz to Jesus, and therefore relieves me of any desire to read a single word more in any further books he might ever write."
2,Skip this one.,"Ok, ok, I'm a trekkie. And I like the ""after series"" books, but this one was really bad. Long, drawnout ramblings that went no where....it seems like the authors lost interest several times during the writing, came back to it again sometime later, and forgot where they left off..........or just didn't care. Do skip this one."
3,I waited a long time for this to be printed on CDs,A good listen. Some boring chapters and some points are repeated too often. It could've used multiple readers to liven it up.
4,Good Read,"When I picked this book up I wasnt sure it was going to be good, but the book captures the readers from jump. Reader will have a laugh with the characters and I'm sure some can probably relate to some of them. The story comes alive and take you into the lives of the characters and it will have you laughing, crying, and begging for me. This book had me laughing so much but the end takes a turn and will leave the reader with tears. I'm waiting on the sequel b/c its definatly is needed. Hurry up Dawn with that sequel so your readers can continue on with the drama you write. First good book and I hope more is to come."
5,Great album from a great band,"For people who are fortunate enough to remember Athenaeum, I strongly encourage you to pick this album up. Like most bands, their early releases provide a new look into the development of the sound and style of their music.I liken this record to their ""Hourglass"" release. It is definitely a great item to pick up if you can find it."
5,One gritty and hard-hitting Hollywood memoir,"I found this book on a bedside table at a friend's house, opened it, and was glued all night. What a life! Talk about highs (literally) and lows. But Miss Lee can write with a real punch. She doesn't suffer fools (except her own youthful self), and she knows how to call it like it is. Funny, tough, very ironic. Read it if you can!"
3,Excellent,This video is a welcome change from the usual morrissey format. It is a must have for any morrissey fan.
3,No hidden promise.,"Following his CDs on Bill Evans and Duke Ellington which in both personnel and innovative arranging were totally remarkable, I ordered this in the hope of more similar delights. Unfortunately I think this must be described as a scrapbook, more scrap than book. There are some good things but it is all of a totally different calibre than the later works."
5,Perfect high-tech melodic rock!,I only found out about this album recently but it is an absolute gem in the melodic rock genre. It has all of the great session players from Michael Landau and Steve Lukather on guitar to Richard Marx and Randy Jackson on backing vocals and bass. Tim Feehan's powerful vocals are brilliant throughout and the production is extremely polished. This is a must buy for fans of high-tech melodic rock and highly recommended to fans of Toto and Richard Marx styled rock.
1,"Screen cracked from poor opening design,no support from Lenovo","This was a great laptop for the price, last week I was outside and opened the screen using the stupid right side release. Screen cracked from the flex of the cheap plastic design. Seven months old, Lenovo will not take responability of the poor design,and will charge $750 to repair it. What a Piece of Chineese crap. I'm typing this review on a Dell Latitude CPi from 1998. The screen is perfect !"
1,Yucky,The cooked result was too gritty. Skip these and buy Pamela's Chunky Chocolate chip cookies. You can eat them right out of the box and they taste good.
3,Diamond review,Format was old and difficult to follow because you had to wait for 25 situations before analysing the event. When the reviews were done they had different footage.Good info but poor production
1,Disappointment,The product didn't do what it said it would. I cut the power to use it in my car (I shouldn't have assumed it worked properly) so I couldn't return it and ended wasting $50. I was extremly dissapointed in this product.
4,A treasure,"My copy of this book is a beautiful old printing full of pasted in prints of EGC's work. The text is intended to be instructional, but EGC writes in a very personal fashion. He throws in tid bits of his philosophies of theater (he was a professional scenic designer), he attacks the character and ability of peers, digging up what was probably a personal feud with a Professor Gehimrat. There are personal anecdotes and the whole thing is generally an enjoyable read. The prints included are some of my favorite illustrations and just from a purely historical interest give a good impression of his theatrical aesthetic. My own copy is not one of these for sale because I will not part with it. I recomend if you are interested that you snag your own copy and keep it in a safe place."
1,Incoherent!,"I bought this book expecting to get a profile of the Portuguese people, a picture of their national identity. I thought this is what the title meant. Instead I found a mishmash of scattered information, and some of it may not be particularly accurate. The whole thing just does not make much sense. You certainly do not get a profile of the Portuguese people. In a way this is a book that leaves you with an uncomfortable feeling."
2,"Good first impression, then disappointment","Something that made me buy this book was the large amount of websites. I was quite impressed. Unfortunately I found out later that the same web addresses appear in several chapters, they are much fewer than it looks at first, and some may not be active or only remotely relate to the topic in the chapter. Another disappointment was contradictory information. Not only the same web sites come around several times, but the same topics too, though under different headings. The information you get under one heading may not match what you get under another. It is so for example with Estado Novo. Portuguese history in general is rather confusedly presented anyway. I have since found another book I would recommend instead. It is a Penguin book by Marion Kaplan, The Portuguese, the Land and its People, published in 1998. I enjoyed reading this one."
2,It gives you a strange picture of the people and the country,"I have been to Portugal several times and have friends there. When I showed this book to my Portuguese friends they were very critical. A lot of wrong information, bias, etc. Not being a national, there is much I don't know, but in some points I can easily see good reasons for my friends' disapproval. Just to mention one of them, there is a whole section of the book on things like witchcraft and related practices. It makes the Portuguese look rather superstitious and unpleasant. This is the opposite of what I have experienced. They are quite open minded and easy to relate to. I think this book gives the wrong picture of the Portuguese people, and not a very nice one."
2,Worryingly unprofessional,"If this book seeks to be entertaining, well, perhaps it is. If it seeks to inform, that is the main problem. It may be telling you tales that you may believe to be truths. Statements are attributed to individuals, but we do not know where the statement was copied from. Figures are given as statistical data, but we don't know where they come from. All this is rather unusual. It is normal practice to inform the reader of the source of your quotes. Not in this book. This is rather unprofessional, particularly where quotes give a negative picture of the country and its people, which is often the case. According to this book the number of Portuguese people who cannot read or write is over twice the official figure issued by the EU. I wonder whether the author got her figures from. It is worrying that this is not known. Very unprofessional. A book to be taken with great caution."
3,A mixed bag!,"Most of this book makes entertaining reading, but I don't think it gave me what I was looking for. I bought this book trying to improve on my understanding of the Portuguese people. I don't think the book gave me that. There is a lot of information, but perhaps not always very objective. On occasions sense of humour may take over. Information on the Portuguese language, way of life and history is not always clear, but is confusingly repetitive. My advice is as follows: if you want to take a humorous look at the Portuguese people, then this book is for you, but if you are looking for a reliable source of information, then look elsewhere. It's a bit of a mixed bag!"
2,Disturbingly inaccurate,"This book makes statements that may be just a personal view but are presented in a manner that may suggest they are confirmed facts. It is so with statements on education and status. History is given inaccurate coverage too. You may find some faulty statements about well known periods of Portuguese history like the discoveries in the 15th and 16th centuries and Salazar in the 20th century. Instead of this book I would like to recommend a more objective and informative work, Terry Payne's Portugal Matters, published by Education Matters. It covers geography, history, politics, culture, society and language. It also has interviews with Portuguese people coming from all walks of life"
5,"A bit high priced, but....","It's a bit high for a disc..but, if you're a fan of Peter Sellers...treat yourself..It's his last film and will probably be a cult classic, if not already. I've never spent this much on a disc, but, in this case, I don't regret it. Having seen it before, I knew what a treat it would be...and it was...for plot reviews etc..go to IMDB...."
3,For my brother,My brother absolutley loves this movie. Perfect for people who like physical comedy. I would suggest it for anyone who likes slapstick!
4,Hysterically funny if you're in the right mood,"Come to this movie in the right frame of mind, open to a bit of silliness, and you will have a great time watching Peter Sellers last movie. He plays both leading roles, and co-stars with a vivacious young Helen Mirren."
3,Fiendish indeed!,"While Peter Sellers still had his skill as a comedic actor this film proves to be a poor vehicle for his talents. Based on dime novel stories, this film sees Fu Manchu (played by Peter Sellers) at the end of his very long life and seeking the ingredients for the elixir vitae, a concoction which will restore his youth and vitality. His thefts soon bring him to the attention of both the FBI and Scotland Yard and Fu's old adversary, Nayland Smith (also played by Peter Sellers), is brought out of retirement in order to combat the plot. Hilarity follows?While the film is not a total loss neither is it one of those comedies with memorable scenes. The plot proceeds with almost mechanical timing. It's a pity... one would think with Peter Sellers in the cast that the film would really take off. Still, better than much of what is coming out today and well worth seeing."
4,FOV,"This cd is truly worth purchasing because it's full of great tracks. If you heard any of FOV's songs, you'd know what their songs are like; great vocal and melody. They're most popular song, I'm guessing would be Dan Dan Kokoro Hikareteku. If you liked that song, I'm sure you'll enjoy this cd."
4,Good stuff for fading,"If you're doing loads that fade a lot, be sure to use this stuff for that. It does a wonderful job of keeping colors true, even blacks. Gotta love that! I have blacks and navys that have to be washed in very hot water and Cheer really does amazing things in helping the color stay. It also comes in clear if you have allergies to odors. Love that too! I still prefer Tide for the cleaning power that it has, probably always will, but I do buy Cheer to help things stay bright. Recommend!"
3,A bit iffy.,"I'm too young to have tasted this back in the day and maybe that's why it's not very nostalgiac to me. =p I do like the flavor of this gum but the biggest problem is that it loses it EXTREMELY fast. =( I used to work in a candy store so I was very eager to try it and while I'm glad I did, I wish I could've bought a single pack instead of 12 because it lost its glamor fast with me. So to me this gum is one of two things: a fun experiment or a nice trip down memory lane. If you want to spend money on either of those, then by all means, go for it!"
2,Lasted less than 30 minutes before falling apart.,This is cheap junk. We purchased two for our twins and they broke them both in short order unintentionally.
1,waste of money,This is only captures of still paintings and very few photographs and has an annoying music playing over and over. It is not a movie or dvd movie. IT is not worth the one star review.
3,"Good Content, shame about the editing","This book is worthwhile if you are willing to work at it. It is possible to gain a good understanding of the ""big picture"" behind AWT and Swing which prepares you to create basic to intermediate GUIs. The downside is bad editing - code samples that obviously shouldn't be there, repetition of the same facts and occasional overuse of academic language that serves to confuse rather than enlighten. If you don't have some background in ""formal"" computer science or programming then you may want to look elsewhere."
1,"Dry repetitious text, toy code","Style is subjective, and I really disliked this author's style. I think he was trying to be eloquent at times (simply loves the word ""abstraction""), but it sounded muddled to me. The introductory material seemed especially burdensome - endless repetition which doesn't provide real insight.And really dry. 140 pages of toy code showing the endless variations of all the event models. Other reviewers are correct that this book has way too many editing errors - especially in the code listings.C'mon - an introduction to Swing GUI development should be downright FUN! This book is simply too oppressive to recommend."
3,"Good content, poor editing","On the plus side, this book fairly covers topics on AWT and Swing. A few chapters are devoted for describing AWT & Swing concepts and architecture. However poor editing, repeatative facts are the flip side of this book. It is not worth the price."
2,Effective but Prolematic,"This washer did a great job, but within two months had to be returned under the warranty. The Quattro nozzel failed within several days. Only the highest pressure setting continued to work properly, and, since that was really what I needed, I lived with it. Then the trigger operated switch failed; the machine kept running whether or not the trigger was pulled, and I assumed that it would eventually self destruct under those conditions. I really wanted the convenience of electric, having previously had gas models, and, since I don't use the units frequently enough, I generally was never able to start the gas engine. Unfortunately, my experience with this unit will probably drive me back to gas."
1,low pressure,"I hate washing a car, but needed to save money while trying to save my back. Bought this Karcher K3 97M and it has only lasted 4 yrs and that's less than 20 uses. I'm able to 'you know what' with more pressure and I'm 65. Siphon hose won't pick up the soap either.Waste of money. I'll never buy another cheap one like this."
5,Superb book.,"Articulate, funny, informed and well referenced. Please send a complimentary copy to all world leaders!I highly reccommend this book to all who work in development."
4,"Overly Pessimistic, But A Must-Read","This is a very good book, though it is a little disheartening in places. Where his rival, Jeffrey Sachs, is an idealist, Easterly is a pessimist, and also to an extreme. Overall, though, his book is interesting and insightful, and, in some places, it does show promising potential solutions to poverty. I don't agree with everything Easterly writes, but, if you're interested in development economics or poverty alleviation, this book is absolutely a must-read."
3,Good Analysis; Weak Vision,"Easterly's analysis of some of the inefficiencies of foreign aid that explain its weak effectiveness is very relevant. His arguments concerning foreign aid institutions lack of accountability, compounded with their incapacity to integrate the poor people's preferences (the very people they are supposed to help) in order to deliver valued and useful public goods is very revealing. However, Easterly's analysis does not give any convincing and politically realist ways foreign aid can be made more efficient. It is not forseable that searchers apply and obtain grants for any projects they can conceive without any coherent way of atributing foreign aid besides supply of funds where there is a serious demand for funds for foreign aid. Foreign aid cannot work in the same way that private or financial markets do, simly because they do not have the same objectives, and do not have the same ethical considerations (amongst other differences). Overall, it is a good read."
2,Leaves the track,"This is an interesting book as long as it stays on topic: why aid efforts do little good. The author's answer -- that there is too much bureaucracy and not enough entrepreneurship -- is given using coined jargon but the author is himself a creature of bureaucracy and that's the way it talks.But about half-way through, the book becomes a screed about what the author believes to be the West's foreign policy mistakes for the last 150 years. Their is nothing new or interesting in this, whether you agree with it or not. The book is worth about half its price unless you really want to read, for the umpteenth time, a solidly liberal analysis of everything from colonialism to Iraq."
4,"Very informative, unfortunately too much detail","Prof. Easterly knows what he is writing about as he spent many years with the World Bank. His basic thesis is, that the aid to developping countries does not lack funding, but the funds are applied very inefficiently. The ""customers"" of the help agencies are not the needy poor, but the ""rich"" donor countries and their citizens. Hence aid is applied to please these customers, rather than pleasing the poor. In other words, he applies market logic to explain the reasons for failure.The only draw back to the book is its length. After some time, the book starts repeating itself, and the details become onerous for the interested lay person. (Who, except the specialist really cares about some fine differences between World Bank IMF and the various UN agencies?)Even though I did not finish the book for that reason, I highly recommend it to anybody, who wants to know, why his aid money does not seem to work."
4,"Despite the title, a little to PC to be effective","Whilte the author has some important and sometimes hard-hitting points to make about foreign aid and its effectiveness (or lack thereof), it's obvious he still wants to get invited to the cool cocktail parties in New York. He correctly focuses on the aid community's penchant for big projects with no specific accountability vs. smaller, user-oriented ones. However, he seems obliged to maintain a veneer of ""neutrality"" by opposing military operations despite their proven success in cases like Japan and South Korea. He also over-uses statistics in questionable circumstances that make for heavy going and undermine his credibility. It's also a little pathetic that he has to make clear from little family vignettes that he is a vegetarian and imposes an artsy-fartsy lifestyle on his kids. Not a surprise that he's divorced. Still worth the read."
2,Cursory at best.,"The author makes a well intentioned effort to cover the material but it's often superficial. He tries to simply cover too much material. He has a bad habit of making jokes regarding the poor judgment of the players involved. Its not that the jokes aren't clever, but they come off as superficial and take away from the seriousness of the subject matter. If you know nothing about the topic it's a good first read, but that's where its usefulness ends."
3,Study Bible,"This was the Bible I was looking for. When received the corners were bent in, I believe from shipping in brown envelope and no packing. Also had to glue the binding before I was able to give as a Christmas gift."
3,"Cute idea, but very difficult for younger kids to assemble","My son loves the things we build with this set, but the pieces are VERY difficult to snap together and take apart for a child. My husband and I have to do all the building. My son is 3 and he can't really build with it yet. He'll have to be much stronger before he can build himself. I would say that a kid would have to be closer to 6-10 to be able to assemble and unassemble this toy."
2,Did not come with the canister shown in the picture,I am sure this is a great product but I purposely bought it from amazon because of the canister because I hate having toys around the kids' room and no storage for them. It did not come in a canister. It came in a regular box. (My daughter's fairy set which I bought from a different site did come in the canister and it's great.) Some people may not care but I thought I would post this so that you know.
5,Great product!,I have a 4 year old grandson who is really into building things. I purchased the Superstructs Starter Set for Christmas and it is one of his favorite new toys. The pieces are sized large enough for little hands and the bendable foam shapes included are great.
3,Fun but hard for little hands,"I bought this for my son on his third birthday. It is a really neat toy. However, it is too difficult for him to put the pieces together by himself. The construction takes so much force that an adult needs to put the pieces together. Not what I had in mind!My son loves to build, so I wish I had just expanded on his woodenJunior TinkerToy Building Set (66 pcs)collection instead. He loves making his own constructions with those!"
5,Great Buy,I was sick at home at knew that my 3-month-old was ready to move up to the next level. The price was fair and I got free shipping.
5,Very Happy with Dr. Browns Products,"I have been extremely happy with the Dr Browns products, this one included. It's made to use with the Dr. Browns bottles and fits fine. They also work with other standard bottles. No leaking. I moved my baby to this size recently at 8 months. He breastfeeds and takes a bottle at daycare. I purchased these and also the level three after he started collapsing the level 1 nipples in an attempt to get the milk out. He's adjusted to the faster flow just fine."
3,1946-1972,"The title of this book should include the years it covers, which are 1946-1972. For those years it does contain a lot of information on serial numbers, options, specs, colors, codes, photos and history of pickups, including El Caminos, Blazers, Suburbans, etc. If the book was published in 1993, why couldn't more production years have been included? Probably so the author can write another book later or a revised edition and sell more copies."
2,Lots of info but some inaccuracy,"I borrowed this book from my father and looked up my 1970 Chevy K20 engine. The truck came with a 350 and i bought it from the second owner who believed the engine was never changed, the book said according to numbers it was a 307ci engine which made me wonder, so upon checking with several other sources and checking the full casting number I found the book was inaccurate it did have the original factory 360ci engine. Of all of the thousands of numbers in the book, the one I needed was inaccurate, maybe thats the one error in the book, but there could be more, stick with info on the internet for free and check with numerous sites to get a consenses."
2,A disappoitment,"Annping Chin narrates the tale of a family of 4 daughters in this book and each chapter is devoted to a part of the life of a member of the family. There is very little dialogue and lots of dry narration. It could do with more photos and perhaps structured in such a way that it is an interview session between the author and the various characters. The only interesting part is the story of the marriage of the 3rd daughter to Shen Congwen, a well-known Chinese author. It provided some valuable and unknown insights into the minds of Shen.I have just seen a Chinese translation of the work in a bookshop a few days ago. I wonder whether Chinese readers will find this take too superficial."
2,It makes you wonder ...,"... how good their tests can be when the same company that produces and proctors the GRE exams produces a publication that's this full of errors. I purchased this book for its section on Psychology and found (in one hour) these mistakes / oversights: 1) They failed to list the number one Psychology program in the country anywhere in their book (Stanford, CA); 2) They don't have listed the institution I'm presently attending, a masters level psychology program; 3) They don't have listed in the Descriptions/Addresses section the University of California - Berkeley, the number two program in the country. Mind you, I was just concentrating on Psychology programs in California. And while it's possible that I somehow managed, in a short time, to discover every flaw this book has ... what can I say but that I doubt it. Frankly, I believe a dedicated web search would produce better results. I hope their tests are better edited, for all of our's sake."
1,Where's the rest of the show?????,This is an edited version of the VHS version that came out in 1997.It's under an hour where the VHS was 90 minutes.This is totally unacceptable considering most DVD's give you extras.A lot of the key moments from the VHS tape are missing.Don't waste your money.This was an import.Hopefully Rhino will release this soon and get it right.
2,Disappointing Import,"This import from Holland has faded colors (compared to Rhino's VHS version), no special features (not even the bonus interview footage Rhino provided), & totally random chapter stops (much like a DVD-R). The show is well-done, but I guess I'd recommend not trading in your VHS copy for DVD until Rhino puts out an official reissue."
2,you can keep it,I purchased this nailer shortly after it first came out. I used it commercially for installing cabinets. It failed me miserably.The gun would not even drive 1 5/8 inch brads consistently. The increased power setting was an extreme hassle and still did not help. The only thing good about the gun is it feels solid and emits an almost gunsmokish scent. I gave the $200+ tool to a friend and bought a portercable which works.
2,jam-o-matic,"this got to be a joke from senco. i own a brad from hitichi,porter cable and now senco. after 5 shot of brad nail the gun jam every 5-6 shot. for the money i thought this was a well engineer gun, maybe senco lost their touch. if you don't mind wasting time changing jamm nails this is the gun!"
5,Nine years and still marvelous,This brad gun has performed flawlessly for nine years. You'll not regret getting one. I've only had to replace the rubber tips once.
5,"Great brad nailer, if brads are the right thing","I have used this nailer to drive brads up to 2"" in hardwood and softwood. No jams, and a mis-fire is rare. Lightweight and easy to use. BUT...I bought this to use for trim work, and I've concluded the 18 ga. brad just doesn't have adequate holding power to pull material together and keep it that way. The brad heads are very small, and they pull through easily. I thought I could just use more of them to compensate, but that doesn't solve the problem. In harder woods like yellow pine, the thin brads sometimes follow the rings and blow out the side of the piece rather than going in straight. A brad nailer is OK for light duty or just holding the piece in place for you while you hand drive some real finish nails. But for trim work I would recommend a 15 ga. nailer. I would buy the Senco 15 ga. nailer as my first nailer if I was starting over."
1,Did not live up to the name,I purchased this nailer and had it shipped overnight since I had a trim job waiting. The nailer bypassed air through the exhaust as soon as I connected the air for the first time. It wouldn't shoot the nail at all until I set it to turbo. Thought giving it a shot of oil would help. The gun still leaks. I called the local repair shop since I needed the gun and was willing to pay for a repair but they said that it is real hard to get parts from Senco these days. So I am back looking for a nailer that can stand-up to commercial use. It won't be Senco anymore.
2,more money doesn't = better tools,"I bought the gun about 6 months ago, was pleased at first even impressed but since things have changed. The gun has a problem of not sinking the nails, I'm talking about the head not sinking by about 1/8th of an inch. By the time I use a nail set to set the nail I may as well have brought out the 16 gauge,which doesn't go over well on finished cabinetry. Also the firing pin likes to stick. Considering switching back to the porter cable or possibly trying the hitachi. Hope this review was helpful, gave it 2 stars for the times its working as it should."
1,READ CAREFULLY. VERY VERY MISLEADING ADVERTISEMENT,Read the product description very carefully. I must have been asleep when I ordered this because I paid about 10X too much comparatively speaking. I spent about ab$23.00 for what amounts to a little over 1/3 of an ounce. OUCH. This is very very unethical and I am in shock that this company is even allowed to sell on Amazon. Can you spell S C A M?????
1,Tiny Bottle,I guess i didn't realize just how small 1 oz is but that's besides the point. I'm done buying fake cologne off of amazon. I bought several bottles including this one and compared them to the ones in the department stores. Just spend the extra cash and get the real one.
4,Door lock,Paid 25dollars when building my house for this item. I was getting a builders discount. Paid 15 dollars on Amazon.com. Same exact item. Great value.
3,Good deal but a coating than oil-rubbed,The lock was 1/2 the price (@ $12) compared to other sellers. The pic showed a brushed nickel finish instead of the described oiled black finish. I asked the seller and they quickly confirmed that it was oiled black. The lock arrived quickly but is more of a black plastic coating than an oiled black finish + there is a chip in the coating. Given the price I will touch up the coating myself.
2,this is more like a journal than a book.,"From the review, this book sounded like a regular book. However, it has more of a religious nature with scripture reading after each short section - almost like a personal journal. It would be good to state this in the overview of this book. I was disappointed in it's content."
5,Awesome book for the hurting heart,"I was given this book several years ago when going through a devastating divorce after 30+ yrs of marriage. The friend who gave it to me had been given a copy when going through her divorce by a friend who'd also gone through a divorce and read it . . . a sisterhood of sorts. I cannot say enough good things about this book. It is by far the best book that I read during that difficult time of my life. It offers healing of spirit, validation of you as a woman, and hope that life will be better. Since reading this book, I've likewise purchased numerous copies to give to friends going through divorce and their responses have been the same as to the encouragement it brought. If you read no other book, be sure to read this one!!!"
5,"Excellent book on grieving, divorce, death",Great book to help someone who is grieving whether over divorce or death!
3,The Female of the Species,"Jacopetti and Prosperi came back a year later with Women of the world a ""mondo"" film that attempted to show the bizarre rites and rituals of the female of the species. This film is essentially compiled extra footage taken from Mondo Cane.Like Mondo Cane this film looks better than it has in many years. Blue Underground has done a great job on this restoration. This is also a film of purely historical interest so not much really needs to be said concerning its content. The materail is bizarre but quite tame by today's standards.The dic features trailers for the film and is presented in its original Italian or English soundtracks. Of some interest is the witty commentary by Peter Ustinov that accompanies the film which was written by Jacopetti.Worth seeing if you have an interest but better as a rental than as a purchase"
5,Valuable book,One book I will go back to again and again. Thank you for writing such a valuable book. Great for people to understand the dynamics behind poverty and people who want to bring change.
4,Good basic overview in 96 pages,"This book gives a good basic overview of the actual fortifications, the history and the place of the Maginot Line in French history. Most importantly, it discusses how the line fit into French military strategy It was not meant as a ""wall"" to hold off the Germans at the border, contrary to popular opinion, but part of an integrated defense with infantry reserves held back. The forts, by requiring immense effort to overcome, were supposed to make surprise strategic thrusts very difficult. It's ironic how the very blitzkrieg these were meant to prevent still won out in the end by bypassing it. Due to the extremely short length of book only touches on each of these. For those wanting more depth, they should go elsewhere. But for those interested in spending only about 90 minutes to get an overview, does an excellent job."
4,Wonderful SCORE...,"First off, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, was because I felt that--while the music was GREAT--there wasn't enough of it. The best tracks are, in my opinion, the last ones you'll find on the disc, and each time I hear them, I find myself wishing there was more!I highly recommend this album to fans of movie music; if you are the type of person who goes to movies and one of the highlights for you is a great musical score (believe it or not, some people don't even notice the music unless there are lyrics), then you'd enjoy this one.Oh, and as for ""Skorch"", who rated this poorly because none of the vocals were included on the album: They don't call this a Soundtrack ""SCORE"" for nothin'...(obviously, you picked up the wrong soundtrack)."
1,TOTALLY MISLEADING,THIS IS NOT THE SOUND SCORE YOU HEAR WHEN VIEWING THE MOVIE. THERE ARE NO VOCALS OF ANY OF THE GREAT SONGS IN THE MOVIE. I DARE ANYBODY TO ENJOY THIS CD.
2,T'ai Chi Chih Letdown,"The only redeeming factor to this DVD is that you can follow the moves to eventually memorize their order. I think this woman is a very poor example of how T'ai Chi Chih should be executed. She is stiff and not the least bit relaxed or graceful. It is a very poor instructional video. To actually benefit from it you must turn the volume off because it is such a distraction especially after you know the moves. Unfortunately, I think it is the only one available at this time. T'ai Chi Chih is a wonderful addition to anyone's health program."
5,Always A Hit,"I wish more videos, from the *Just Whitney* album, had been made because Whitney was always fantastic at whatever she did.On the Main Menu, Whitney is singing a remix of *Try It On My Own*. It was fun to hear. The extra footage for this video, though short, was a pleasure to watch.*One Of Those Days* shows Whitney in an up-beat setting, with a few well known faces in the Hip-Hop/Urban world."
5,GREAT SHAKERS.,"just got these today to replace the cheapie plain glass one's we've had forever. Very nice not as heavily brushed as the cookie jar is, but detailing is just as good. each bunny comfortably fils your hand. Make sure you keep tabs on the cork. It's the size of a pencil eraser and clear, so likely to be easily misplaced."
5,the foster's market cookbook,"this is a beautiful cookbook with outstanding recipes! i just love it, and i can always find a great recipe for entertaining a crowd. this is a wonderful gift too."
4,Love these recipes!,"Love the recipes in this book! The hummus is a family favorite...and I love that they are easy to ""tweak"" if I'm short on a particular ingredient, or if it calls for something I don't have. Pretty easy to follow for really yummy results!"
4,A dinner-party star,"I've never been to one of Sara Foster's restaurants, but if this cookbook is any evidence, they must be worthwhile.The recipes in this book represent my idea of good southern American cooking---chicken pot pie with mashed-potato crust, black-eyed pea cakes, roasted veggies. Some are simple, others take a bit more time.What I think is best about this book is how it puts new twists on relatively basic food..that potpie has herbed-mashed potatoes on it, the cakes get interesting ingredients.Some of the dishes require Foster's Market basics-pesto, chive oil-that must be prepared in advance of the main recipe, but nicely enough..you get a page numer reference to lead you straight there. (As dumb as that sounds, I find SO many cookbooks don't do that....)The only caveat: read the recipes carefully...some take longer to prepare than you'd think. And don't miss the risotto cakes..delish!"
3,The Foster's Market Cookbook,"One of the best cookbooks I have acquired! I have over 200!!Easy to follow directions, great food!"
2,She ain't no Barefoot Contessa,This book was very disappointing. The Spicy Gingerbread recipe was EXCELLENT. Everything else I've made out of here was just okay at best. Really not worth the time or money.
2,Needs editing!!,"I tried the recipe for Roast Pork Tenderloin with Dried Cherries and Rosemary. Step One says to preheat the oven, Step Two to mix up a marinade, and Step Three to marinate the pork tenderloin for two to three hours or overnight. So is the oven supposed to preheat ""for two to three hours or overnight""? What a stupid, stupid, STUPID mistake to include in a good-looking, pricey, upscale cookbook. There is no excuse for such carelessness and lack of attention to detail. (To add injury to insult, this expensive recipe wasn't even very good.) I will try a few other recipes in an effort to get my money's worth, but my initial favorable impression of the book has been damaged. Was somebody trying to save a few bucks by not hiring an editor? Hmmm?"
3,Bulky,"This toolbelt, has lots of pouches for a lot of tools, bu it is bulky, that's why my coworkers use lether pouches. If you don't have to slide throug narrow spaces, I gess it is great."
5,My husband was very pleased,I got this tool belt for my husband and he is very pleased with it. Says it fits great and all his co-workers want me to get them one. He frames homes for a living and this belt is very comfortable and has alot of room for all his tools and nails. He is very glad I ordered it.
4,Buy this now!,"I have to admit I was a little skeptical of listening to this whole album through, at first. What I soon learned after my initial listen through was that this is easily one of the best written CD's I have heard in awhile. With the overexposure of decreasingly talented bands and singers who couldn't write their own music if they were locked in a room alone for 10 years, this album is a refreshing find. The artist wrote all his own music, and the recording isn't enhanced in any way (though very professionally done). What you hear on the CD is what the music actually sounds like. Remarkable though it may be for a freshman album, there isn't one song that you won't find yourself humming along to, whether it's a catchy, uptempo song...or one of the slower ballads. So, what are you waiting for?! Buy it today...I'm sure you've spent $8.99 on worse things :) Give it a chance - you won't regret it."
5,Just what we were looking for,"When looking for a book to help my budding entomologist we happened upon this book. Although more pictures would always be great, this book is just what we were looking for to help identify our collection and give some basic information!"
4,Handy Identification tool,Compact little guide and very useful in the field and in the laboratory. Students find the book easy to use.
2,Lack of color makes this virtually useless,"Although this book certainly appears to be detailed and comprehensive, its lack of color photos (there's a single, small section) makes it less than useful. Want to identify that iridescent green bug? Good luck -- this won't help much. The Nat'l Audubon Society's book might be a better bet."
3,An insect guide with mostly black and white drawings and few color plates,"This book has very detailed written descriptions of the many insect orders, as well as sections on how to work with living specimens, the growth and development of insects, and classifying and naming them. However, there are few color pictures, although there are many black and white drawings. I find it much easier to use guides with color photos, particularly for identification purposes."
4,Lots of good information,"I garden extensively and wanted to be able to identify insects on my plants. Unfortunately, there are too many insects to allow all or even most of them to be illustrated in one book. At best, this book will get you to genus. I could not even get to genus on most of them. It's not as useful as I had hoped. The illustrations that are shown are excellent."
4,Extremely interesting book.,"The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the lack of color photos or plates. I honestly read half the book when I first recieved it. I got it because I was worried that this creature I had found was a mutant or something (turned out it was a velvet ant). It does have quite a bit of information on the different animals that make up the order of insects. It does not though give detail into any peticualar family though. There are after all WAY to many insects out there to fit into just one book. Check out the other field guides for butterflies, moths, or whatever you are into. It can be a little technical for the layman (i.e. me) but will help get you started on your adventures in collecting and learning about insects."
3,The wrong sexes?,"This is a good book, however, there are 3 entries that provide incorrect sexes. In particular, the fall cankerworm. This insect is identified in the picture as a female moth, when in truth, it is the male. Females are wingless, this is why banding trees is helpful in control, since she must climb the tree to lay her eggs. The other two entries are also moths, something the author should have been aware of. The book would also benefit from better pictures, rather than illustrations. But for the most part it is a helpful guide and would recommend it next to the audoban societies guide to north american insects."
2,Be aware of the painful Adobe activation process,"Please see reviews of the previous version 7.0. The Adobe activation process can cause a lot of continuing problems for legitimate users of this software. Too bad such good software is hampered by such a process. Being in the software business, I don't mind companies worrying about piracy and taking some measures but this is a bit too much. You might need to allow the software to access the internet regularly to keep your activation (and not bother you with notices of reactivation) but that also means you open it for Adobe to do their push marketing into their software. I have used Adobe products for over 15 years and have always liked them. Too bad, they have lost the customer focus in their rage for software piracy and greed for intrusive marketing."
1,Unbearably SLOW!!,"This is the worst software application that I have ever purchased. It takes an average of three seconds to page up or down and an average of one second per line when scrolling through a document. It is this slow regardless of the size of the document. It is not my computer, because version 7.0 worked perfectly. My computer has a 2.6GHz processor and 1Gbyte of memory. Don't believe their marketing propaganda which claims that they have improved the operating speed over the 7.0 version. Some are blaming the performance problems on their licensing processes that are constantly running in the background. If you don't need the added features in this product stick with the free PDF readers that are available on the Internet such as Foxit."
2,Adobe Support SUCKS!,"The product is pretty good IF you can get it to run on your vista machine. Just hope you dont have to talk with support, they will try to give you trial and error ""solutions"" and then get off the phone not even knowing if it works. I have now called back 4 times and have waited 30 minutes each with no resolution.Acrobat + vista= sucks!"
1,Donot buy it,I use window vista and office 2007. The adobe 8 standard can be upgraded to 8.10 in order to create a PDF from office 2007. However I found that it is so unstable I can not use it every time. PDF is super but Adobe is not as good as its product.Office 2007 has a add in program to create PDFs but this program does not work well especially when I produce figures and save in word 2007. It case super problem when I convert the word file to PDF. So I wish Microsoft can do something for it.
2,Errors & Compatability Issues,The new version of Acrobat Standard 8.0 has several issues. Currently working as an IT Manager for our construction management company and all of our users who have installed this version are having issues with fatal errors and with the program simply terminating in the middle of tasks involving Microsoft Projects. I would not recommend this product if you are creating pdf's from Microsoft Projects.
3,Adobe 8,"Product wasn't in original packaging, missing the books. End users like that sort of thing.Other than that product was shipped in a timely fashion and works."
5,Great anime,It's Seriously a great show. Superhero dork who can control paper saves the world and a few good books too.
3,"Fast-paced, vapid fun!","R.O.D.: Read or Die is an OVA (original video animation, a straight-to-DVD) anime series. A related anime series is currently showing on Japanese TV. The three episode OVA is available on DVD in the U.S., with the first volume of the TV series coming out in the end of June on these shores. This review is of the OVA. The story follows Yomiko Readman, a bookworm with amazing powers over paper (?!) who is hired by the British Library Special Engineering Force to recover lost manuscripts. Sound boring? Well it isn't. She's joined by two other ""agents"" fighting cloned historical figures, and the show is a combination of James Bond and Fantastic Four, and manages to be action packed without taking itself too seriously."
4,Excellent! Well worth your time and dough...,"This one has it all: a good story; fantastic, polished animation and interesting characters.Super-powers that involve the manipulation of paper into weapons and the ability to pass through solid matter? Wonderfully bizarre touches like that and truly amazing action scenes make this one a keeper."
3,"Cool designs, great animation, ... story...","I saw this on my friend's recommendation, but I found it disappointing. The animation itself is cool, and elements of the story are quite original. Ms. Readman's super-power is also quite cool. However, the story feels like a condensed manga, and the characters have very little depth. The dialogue was ..., the female characters were portrayed as either clumbsy and stupid or as leather-clad juggies and no explanation of the insane world of librarian-agents is given. Better than a lot of kiddie anime, but not anything people over 15 need to get excited about."
4,For every MBZ Fan,"If you're a MBZ or if you know of someone that is a fan, this DVD should be part of their collection. Very well put together, very informative and has a lot of great information."
2,nothing special,"Purchased this sheet in queen size, looks pretty and fits the bed very well. I'm not happy with the material and the feel. After you sleep on these one night, they don't feel much like flannel anymore. I'm fairly picky about my sheets and these don't make the grade, they feel scratchy and have ""pilled"". I've only had them for a month or two and I would not purchase this brand again."
1,don't buy,"made a mess of my dryer, color fade and transfer. I would not buy from this Compnay again as they miss stated quality."
1,What a disapointment!,"I guess you buy what you pay for sometimes. I thought I was getting a good deal when I was really getting ripped off. They're printed one just one side so it looks cheap. And though it looks like the pockets are deep enough, mine slips frequently so I have to keep adjusting it.What a disappointment!"
2,Great up to 3rd washing,"I bought this sheets and have such a high expectation. This is Laura Ashley. I used it without washing it, and it was so luscious and soft and so beautiful.However, when I washed it the third time (following directions carefully), it came out horrible. The texture is rough, the patterns faded, and basically the sheets felt like sleeping on sheets with a tablespoon of sand.No amount of re-washing makes it better.I can't even donate it to Goodwill, it was horrible. The only place for this after 3rd washing is the trash! The two stars are for being able to enjoy it til t he 3rd washing."
1,incredibly ugly,"the material is nothing like what i would call flannel. the print is the worst i've seen on sheets. i returned the sheets but had to pay shipping, etc. anyway so ended up spending money on nothing."
1,"not flannel, not hemmed, printed on one side","Beware! These are extremely low-quality sheets. They are not flannel, just thick, rough cotton. The design is printed on one side and looks like it's already starting to wear off. They're not even hemmed, though the design fades where a hem should appear. I'm glad I got these on sale. I'm hoping they last a month."
4,Great sheets - one problem,"These sheets are so cozy and comfortable. My husband and I love them! The only problem is that they came with a hole in the fitted sheet. The hole is on one of the corners, so I easily fixed it by sewing it up. However, you wouldn't expect a hole from such a reputable brand. Nonetheless, the sheets are great!"
2,Hole in Sheets,"I was at first happy with these sheets. After washing them, I noticed a 1 inch square hole in the top sheet. I am not sure if it was there to start with, but I was very disappointed."
5,Very Good,I purchased this sheet set recently and was extremely pleased with it. It looks very nice and feels soft.
3,Flannel sheets,I was a little disappointed with these sheets. They werent as soft as I expected a name brand to be. I like the animal print tho.
2,Not first quality! Holes and damage! Beware!,"The sheet fabric is good quality, washes well, and is soft and cuddly.But like another reviewer (for a different pattern of these sheets), I found a large hole in one of the sheets after I washed it. Fortunately, mine was on a seam so I could stitch it up easily, but why should I have had to? There was also a piece of masking tape and a small mark next to the damaged place.These sheets are obviously not first quality, and probably not second quality, either. The damage was not unnoticed and was not repaired. Amazon is being dishonest in not disclosing the problems with these sheets in the listing. Boo!!But if you are a quilter or sewer who wants an amount of quality flannel at a good price, go for it."
2,NOT REALLY WORTH DISCOUNT PRICE,"I washed these after received them and found one of the pillowcases had a large hole, appeared that stitching was missing in that area, I sewed it closed figuring it wasn't worth sending back for--Unfortunately I also have come to find the King set barely covers my mattress (not a pillowtop) and the bottom of the fitted sheet keeps popping off--Does not seem like ""big name"" quality and would not order anything from this line again"
2,Pattern fades quickly,"I ordered these sheets in early December 2005 - I washed them before putting on my guest bed and they were very fluffy and soft. However, after my guests left and I washed the sheets a second time, the pattern faded very noticeably on the pillow cases, especially at the seams. I haven't noticed any fading on the flat or fitted sheet, just the pillowcases. I won't buy this brand of sheets again."
1,NOT Impressed,Why?1. The sides of the sheets are made on the selvage edge...some places have very tiny holes.2. Small specks of white make the sheet appear as if the pattern did not print correctly.3. Not as soft as other Amazon sheet purchaces of the same thread count.4. Heavy backstitching and loose threads in several places.5. Dark purple topstitching...I guess they ran out of black or brown??? !!!5.
1,Pure Wastage of money,"This product seems as if use and throw, please do not machine wash this ""Laura Ashley Sophia Queen Flannel Sheet Set"" else u will repent. Laura u need to improve the quality of the product. No doubt i received this product very fast, yr service rocks but this product sucks.....plz do not buy this product again,"
4,better than expected,I'd read some poor reviews on another style of Laura Ashley Flannel sheets but I must say I was delightfully surprised by the quality and softness of these sheets. I washed them first and they seemed rather durable. They are the softest sheets I've ever owned! Now if only the cold weather would last a little longer to enjoy them!
5,africa aqddio,Outstanding. Fills in some gaps for me concerning Africa in the 1960's. Hasn't changed much.
5,Remarkable and motivating,"Do It Anyway is an easy book to read. Living its tenets is more difficult. By use of thoughtful questions along with stories from real people, the author suggests ways we can incorporate the Paradoxical Commandments into our lives. By the time you've finished reading, you realize not only your ability to do good, but the strengthened desire to get out there and do it! This book is a quick read that packs a gentle wallop. Read it anyway."
2,It's Just Doesn't Work,"I've liked many of the DVDs from Zurich but this one gets the 2 stars only because of the singing. While I often enjoy unusal productions, this one makes no sense at all and just gets worse with each act -- it has little charm. Why is Act 2 in a kitchen and Act 3 the same as Act 1 with a tent in the middle? I could go on and on about stage actions that do not jive with the libretto. However, I did think that the final scene with the 3 women, right after Ochs leaves, was particularly touching. Vocally, the women are superb, particularly Stemme. However, Kasarova's facial expressions are overwhelming and at times grotesque. Muff was ""okay"" as the Baron but certainly can't compare with Kurt Moll. I wish I could give it more stars due to the singing but the nonsence production is overwhelming."
5,An excellent guide for students learning Thai,This book is an excellent book for people wishing to learn Thai speech and writing. It uses both phonetic Thai and Thai script. Using both books 1 and 2 over a year of study I obtained a fairly good grasp of speech and written Thai which enabled me to communicate on a basic level when visiting Thailand. Highly reccomended for anyone wishing to learn the language.
5,This book has some great photos!,"The photo work is exceptional, with nice, very detailed captions. Even though the Columbia Gorge is just a few miles away from here, it has been little appreciated for its beauty from the point of view of rail traffic. Also, the text is concise and informative."
3,In-depth coverage but heavy reading,"The authors provide a detailed analysis about the nuances of statistics but the writing style is very dry. Also, there are few succinct summaries, making it difficult to look up specific concepts or formulae quickly."
3,A good book but a terrible textbook,"Without any doubt, this is a comprehensive book in this field. However, because the authors tried to demonstrate their superior english writting abilities, they made the whole text hard to understand for students. From my point of view, as a new professor, I don't believe that recommending this book is appropriate."
4,Religiously Enlightening,"This book is much more user friendly than Religion for Dummies. It provides great information on the fundamentals and differences of not only the major religions of the world, but also alternative religions. Very interesting reading."
2,I've read better...,"I can't recommend this overview. I've read several books like it and this one was poorly written. It's a hollow read, no offense."
1,Please!!,"This book is written for those already part of a an irrationally superstitious belief system; that is, any religion. It is sometimes like having Hitler write an impartial essay on Judaism. Their patronizing comments on ateism are enerving. They fail,among other things, to indicate that atheism is not a religion. To make matters worse, they misrepresent Carl Sagan by writing that he was, oh, so much for the""mutual understanding"" of science and religion.Joseph Smith misunderstood and persecuted?? A crook that was lynched by an angry mob satiated with his tricks and swindles.Thsi book is an insult to intelligence.One star because there is nothing less tahn that."
1,I expected more.,"I pretty much agree with the first review. When you read an Idiot's Guide you expect something clear and understandable to an average reader. The blocks and sidebars look good but the language is that of theological scholars. I expected something better. At that, it was sufficiently clear to me that the Middle East (Islamic states) will not support democracy as we know it. ""W"" and his buddies should have read it a few years ago!"
5,Great for fruit dip,"Recipe for pina colada dip - 3 packs BarTenders Pina Colada mix2 cups sour cream (or greek yogurt if you want to make it healthy!)2 T sugar (optional)Mix and serve with pineapple, strawberries, oranges or any fruit you have available.This is a great recipe and very popular with all our friends and family."
5,Very good!Worth reading if you like Nancy Drew!,"Elderly Mr. Pierce has fallen for his nurse,Nila Kirkedottir, and is to wed her.Who is trying to kill Nila?Who is sabotaging Nancy?Will Nancy figure out the puzzle before it's to late? Read to find out!"
5,Great for bleaching dark brown hair,"Awhile ago I had this in a big bottle and it took my hair to a very light blonde in two shots. I didn't have much damage at all and I love that it has a built in toner w/cool tones that counters red tones.Overall, this is a great product, may have to use more than once (3x's for me) to get to lightest blonde. But it's really great and would advise using with Ion's sensitive scalp developer or Clairol's Pure White developer in a 20.A 30 or 40 will get you lighter quicker but will severely damage your hair. Be sure to follow directions and if you have sensitive scalp, try to do it in more than one step, use a moisturizing protein pack set like Aphogee after first process;deep conditioning after with One n Only's Morrocian oil mask overnight in a plastic cap:)"
1,Not for thick hair,I have really thick almost black hair. It had been dyed a medium red brown prior to using this. I mixed this with 40vol pure white developer (my hair is super healthly) and it's still not even. It's white on top and orange and brown through out the back. I will not buy again.
4,Good Tape,"I own a couple 25' Fat Max tapes, and really like them, so I decided to give this one a try.It is a good tool but bare in mind that the 3:1 gear ratio is 1 crank of the handle for 3 revolutions of the internal spool.This make for a fast rewind but not ease of cranking.I felt I was about to break the handle off the first time I realed it in .It seems to be getting looser with wear though.This may not be typical of each tape,I may have received an extra tight one.I dought that you will be dissapointed."
2,Not the best in my book,"The 3:1 rewind ratio is to much, a 2:1 would be sufficient unless you plan to wind it up from the 75-100' area. The tape is flimsy and bends easy. After snapping lines on only 3 houses, the blade wont even lay flat from being bent. The hook on the tip is really loose, and not very accurate, and also doesn't have a hole to drive a nail into to hook it on. Unless you really want the fast rewind aspect, I wouldn't pay the extra money for it. Note: 25' Fat Max works great....."
1,Alarms quit working after less than 2 weeks DON'T BUY,"After less than two week of using this clock both alarms quit working, making both my husband and myself late for work. Don't know if I just got a defective product, but I would not recommend AT ALL!"
3,Super Reader,"Not as good as the first one. Hardly anyof the really cool dog, either. Here we have a story of a more mundane sort of political and corporate corruption. One high flyer frames another for murder, for control reasons. He also has gangster connections.Wentworth comes across the wronged man's daughter shortly before he is due to be ex3cuted. He gets on the case, to try and put a stop to it.An interesting soiree or two is attended, where Dick is heard to drily remark ""I am of opinion of Petronius, ten thousand nude maidens have less of an effect than one"".After which he makes a gangster strip, ties him to a bed with wire, and stomach whips him to get the location of the aforementioned daughter.Again, the Commissioner comes close to catching him, due to his Spider cigarette lighter.All in all, something missing here, though.2.5 out of 5"
4,Great book about rare culture,"Describes the Romanies without adding many stereotypes, or assumptions. The author wanted to experience the Romanies on his own personal experiences, and settled in a small Spanish town where they lived in caves."
3,"FUNNY, STRANGE, ENGAGING AND WIERD","I am reviewing the audio cassette version. John de Lancie created the character Q in the Star Trek, TNG TV show. He was always funny, fun interesting and engaging. He is all that here and he leads us and his old buddies Picard and Data on a romp across the universe to solve a mystery, and maybe even prevent the end of time itself! 3 stars is for good. 3 star uis for fun, and having delacie read the book himself, just made it fun to listen to. Sometimes the plot just got stupid. I went from laughing and smiling to Ughhhhh back and forth listening to this. In the end i liked it enough that i have listened to it several times now. It does get even better with a second listen, but it was 3 star on the first listen. Now if you like wierd sci fi... You may want to give this a 4 or 5."
3,The Final Cut,"This is a very interesting game. The upside is that you have a palm pilot that you can review at anytime and you can jump to locations once you have visited them. The downside is that it uses keyboard controls to move the character. It is very difficult to locate hotspots because the character must be in a certain position, facing a certain way to trigger the symbol which means you can ""see"" something. You have to go over a room several times in all possible directions to see if you have missed anything."
1,Weak + Lame = waste of $,"This game was so bad I wanted to write review. poor design, numerous buggie areas, nothing to keep your interest. I'd like to send them a bill...Similar design concept to Blade runner but much more poorly done. FC crashed in the middle of the game and I never tried to finish it."
1,Beware - UBI Softs packaging & web site lie about mim req's,UBI Soft's packaging in the stores AND web site state minimum hard drive free space is 300mb. My install failed because it said it needed 744mb free space. Not a good sign as to the competance of the programming for the game. Good luck.
1,Many Misfires,"It constantly misfired and needed to be cleaned to work again, I finally had enough and took it to a service shop and I've only owned this nailer for 1 year. It will cost me 1/3 the cost of the nailer to fix. I'll never own a Paslode Impulse nailer again and I'm currently looking into a compressor driven nailer set up."
2,Misfire City,My Pasload misfires constantly. I've cleaned it often per the user manual and even after only a few fasteners it will misfire. I am strongly disappointed with this tool and considering switching to a compressor driven nailer.
2,Great in Theory....,"I bought both this gun as well as the Paslode Framing Nailer. I used the Framing Nailer first to make walls to finish my basement and planned on using this gun for the finish work. The framing Nailer worked awesome, but I cannot give this gun the same rating. It either jammed, or froze up on me 7 out of 10 times I used it. In each case you have to take the gun apart, clean it out make sure everything is moving. I would not reccomend this particular gun to anyone, although when it does work it does the job its designed to do very well.Overall I liked the design and weight, and the fact that you can drive a 2"" nail into very hard wood. the gun just is not reliable enough for everyday use. When I bought this it was the only choice I had there are several other brands that are compressorless now also."
2,"janmmin tool ,nail jammin",I have a three year old tool which has jammed 25% of the time I have fired it. It is going back for the second time to be repaired I love the concept because I am a cabinet and trim installer but I cant waste the time unjamming this piece of junk the last 10 times I fired it it has bent the nail and fired it half way into the trim. I have all the cleaning products and have become adept at tearing it down and cleaning it . there seems to be an alignment problem with the safty bar not compressing into the nose of the gun. I guess I will continue to bring my compressor for nails bigger than 1 1/4 inches ( which is the limit for my porter cable gun with the commpressor in the tool ) the pc is an awsome tool I wish I could say that about this tool.
2,Great at first,"I am a professional window and door installer of many years. These Paslode tools are a great time saver when working properly, but they really don't care for the cold and are very finicky. Sorry, but these tools needs to work for me and they don't. They are costing me time on the job. Last week the angled nailer almost landed in the snow bank due to my frustration.If you need this tool - keep it warm with plenty of reserve fuel cells.I am going to battery power (at least I won't keep throwing away fuel cells) with air back up."
2,Agree with others on the jamming,For simple face nailing/finishing work this tool does okay. But try to nail through hardwood and the jams start piling up. I've tried everything recommended here including purchasing new gas and am giving up and heading into the store to get a compressor & nail gun. I'm just plain fed up with this tool. From now on I will only use it for very simple face nailing projects that I want to do quickly without pulling out a compressor...
2,Does it really save time?,"The first time i used the paslode it was great! It saved lots of rollout and rollup time on punchout. The next day it wouldent work, batteries were fully charged, fuel cell was nearly full. We only used a hundred or so nails the previous day. I cleaned the nailer per instructions, still it would not work. I returned it to the store where purchased and exchanged it for another nailer. This one works about 80% of the time, and i'm only getting around 500 nails per fuel cell. I love the paslode when it wants to work, but with the cost of the fuel cell and only 500 nails per fuel cell and the constant matinance, the time saved ends up costing more."
3,Misfires,"After about 400 nails thru this nailer, it started misfiring consistently. No amount of cleaning, recharging and replacing the fuel would get it back to normal. I still like the convenience of this though, so I ordered a replacement from Amazon. Will see if the next one will be better."
3,"Good gun, but I wouldn't buy another one","I loved the Paslode angle nailer when I first purchased it. It was very convenient to use and no hoses to get in the way. One day I couldn't get the battery in! It seems there are little black pads under the battery contacts in the battery compartment. One of the pads shifted and wouldn't allow the contact to move. I had to use a screwdriver to get the pad out, just so I could use the gun. This may sound minor, but for $400 dollars I would expect better for a gun less than six months old!"
2,Frustrating,"Jams constantly, (with new fuel cell) and always when nails get to the end, Impossible to nail with the last 10 or so nails. Usually corrected by removing remaining nails and reloading with a full set.Jam can take, sometimes 15 minutes to clear nails from magazine."
2,Very Convenient But Also Very Unreliable,"I've also experienced a lot of the same problems as other reviewers with the gun acting erratically and misfiring a lot. I'm just a weekend warrior kind of guy and not a contractor so I don't use it that much, and I've still had problems with it during limited use. I love the freedom from a compressor but it comes at a price: reliability."
5,It pays for itself in no time,"I bought this to put up some tongue and groove pine in a cottage. (I already have the Paslode framing nailer, which is great). The finish nailer is 5 star all the way, it is light and easy to handle, the depth of drive adjustment is dirt simple...so you don't have to go back and counter sink finish nails. It worked right out of the box, just charge up the battery, install a cylinder and nails, and your in business."
5,confused by the bad reviews of this tool,"Bought the Paslode Framing and had such success on the job with it, i considered the finish nailer. Thinking that the finish nailer would be great so taht you are not dragging dirty houses through a home, i read the reviews on amazon and was amazed at the number of poor reviews. However, i went for it and just like the framer, this gun has performed flawlessly. Make good contact with the workpiece and it is as simple as that. Highly recommended!"
1,Don't spend a cent on this piece of junk,"I use the word nailgun loosely because it actually has to fire nails to qualify. I bought this gun brand new and right out of the box there were serious problems. Primarily with the fact that I have to depress the nose so many times to even get this thing to fire once. I have the framing nailer too, so I know these guns have to be cleaned. Right out of the box though, there should be no excuse for this. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk."
1,If it would only work......,"All the same problems everyone else has had, except after my Paslode refurbishment it began shooting nails out of the bottom of the nail holder (about an inch from the tip of the gun). This is not good at all. I had high hopes for this tool and I really wanted it to work."
1,Be Afraid . . .,"I recently bought a Paslode framing nailer and a finish nailer. The framing nailer is OK but the finish nailer is just awful. It only fires about 30% of the time and will just stop working. I then have to remove the nails, battery, and fuel cell; jiggle the wires to the controls and spark plug and then maybe just maybe it will fire a few more times.(I am at 5500' and am using the high altitude fuel jet but that doesn't make a difference.)From my experience I would not recommend this tool. I thought that the absence of a compressor hose would be a very good thing but when this nailer stranded me I had to go to my local rental store and rent a pneumatic nailer to finish my job. I found that dealing with a hose is not as big a hassle as I thought it would be. I will return this portable nailer and replace it with a pneumatic one and save about $250."
4,Good for punch list items,My job had provide me with this nail gun about a year ago. I did noticed that it doesn't alway fire when I press it up againt the work and depress the trigger. It only happens once in a while when I go too fast. (about one nail per 2 seconds) I like the tool alot but wouldn't use it to replace my compressor with hoses in the shop. I basically use it on punch list items and places where I couldn't bring a compressor with a hose.Note: Some of the other carpenters I work with prefer to use this gun rather than the nail gun with the hoses. It is a lot easier to carry around.
3,unhappy carpenter,"I bought the 900600 angle finish nailer 10 months ago, and I have a lot of misfiring. I keep the nailer cleaned frequently and it still misfires. Sometimes it will fire 8 or 10 nails and then it will not fire. I have tried everything I can think of to fix it.I would like to know if I am doing something wrong or if it is the nailer. I would appreciate any help you could give me. Thank you."
5,cant live without,"If you ever do trim work, punch work or just hate cords and hoses, this tool is a must. Shoots faster then i expected and never feel like I have to wait for it to cycle. Light weight ans well balanced tool."
1,Buyer beware,I purchased this product approximately 1 year ago expecting to do some home improvements. The unit failed to operate despite required maintenance and cleaning according to manufacturers' required intervals. An electronic failure produced a fault which is costly to repair (1/3 to 1/2 the cost of the tool) Don't buy unless you've got money to waste
5,Awesome Tool!,"I have been using an air trim nailer but now I am hooked. It doesn't matter about the cost of fuel or the device, this makes things so much simpler. The angled head makes it so much more versatile and maneuverable. No air compressor, no hoses, and it works great! I will try and get a framing gun in the future."
3,New technology of material,"I am so interested with the topic of this book gives, because shape memory alloy tech. is very...very usefull for human live, because it carry us to the world of automatic, everything can made automatic using thermal technologies. Excelent...this is very good book."
3,Imperfections,"The chapter that has been written by K.N. Melton in the book, is very irregular point of English grammer. I could not understand most of it. It must rebuilt. Moreover, in some places of the book, I think that there is no sufficiency."
4,The Glory Days of Boston Baseball,"This is a very well researched book. The author included a lot of sidebars, photos and illustrations that make it more entertaining. It still has moments when it drags if one attempts to read it straight through, but it is a good coffee table book and fun to browse. Mr. Soos is also the author of an excellent series of baseball related mysteries set from 1912 -1922."
2,"Fills a niche, but not well","For anyone wanting to know more about early baseball in New England this is a helpful addition to the literature, but as another reviewer pointed out it's a weakly written coffee table book. In fact you'd need lots of strong coffee to read it straight through."
2,You get what you pay for!,"I needed several low wattage night light bulbs for a project and figured a bulb is a bulb, right? Wrong! About half of these (bought 16)either didn't work right out of the package or stopped working in less than an hour. I would not buy these again."
2,Who could even consider 5 stars?,"The standards of some reviewers must be quite low to rate this as even a 4-star movie. Yes, it had some good stars; and the plot had a few good twists. However, the latter attribute is what we expect from a caper movie, in fact defines one. Also, the sexism was antiquated even by 1968. Robinson's acting in this was perfunctory; the Italian's attitude toward sex was more American c.1968, than European; The laser beams literally sag in the vault scene; and the excessive number of close calls became tiresome by the end. There is absolutely nothing to recommend this, given the large number of much better caper movies that have been made in the last 60 years.Finally, it must be noted that as a package, the DVD is virtually empty of extras, and the print quality is inconsistent, ranging from 2-stars to 4-stars."
4,All this and Klaus Kinski in a sailor suit too!,"Grand Slam is a surprisingly enjoyable caper flick, and much more fun than any film with middle-aged men in tight black trousers and Klaus Kinski in a sailor suit has any right to be. I say surprisingly because anything that turns up on the Blue Underground label generally turns out to be a disappointment, but this globe-trotting diversion about a heist in Rio de Janeiro during the carnival looks great and is a much better piece of disposable entertainment than either the Rat Pack or Soderberg's Oceanic efforts. Ennio Morricone's main title is a particularly blatant ripoff of Burt Bacharach and the Tijuana Brass' Casino Royale with il maestro's own special flavoring, but only adds to the fun.Although the only extras are a photo gallery and trailer, the 2.35:1 transfer is for the most part very good, with excellent vivid color."
3,Things Change,"This movie is somewhat out dated now. When it was first released the movie was quite contemporary with an oustanding cast.The surprise ending was very unexpected. For those who enjoy Carnival in Rio,great street scenes during Carnival this is the movie for you. Super cast."
3,"It's No Rififi, but...","Perfectly adequate, albeit overlong heist caper movie, no more, no less. Back in 1955 Jules Dassin's Rififi set the bar for this genre, and no film since has even come close (Topkapi, also directed by Dassin, occupies a reasonable second place). Grand Slam does have the added bonus of some nice location shooting in Rio during Carnival. The object of the heist is diamonds, and, as with most heist movies, most of the film centers on the planning and preparation, along with unforeseen complications (the title refers to the name of a new alarm system that has been installed, unanticipated by the thieves, to further protect the vault), and the execution of the heist. Of course, the real suspense for the viewer falls under the ""will they or won't they get away with it"" rubric. Some twists at the end as well. Nice to see Edward G. Robinson in one of his later roles, even if he has little screen time. Recommended for fans of this genre; otherwise, you can take it or leave it."
5,Great Story,The story is compelling. Beware: the death scenes were a little too gruesome -for my taste. The author's portrayal of the various Italian and Dutch characters is delightful. The main character's struggle kept my attention and the secondary characters were well developed - very real. The elaborate descriptions of the Italian countryside and the quaint city of Amsterdam reminded me of vacations spent Europe. I'd like to see this book turned into a movie.
5,"Gripping, creepy and suspenseful","This is the story of a man on the run. Jack Barillo finds that men from his past are getting killed one by one (warning to the squeamish: this ain't Agatha Christie's type of killings--these are startlingly detailed). The killer, Lucifer, seems to be the type who can't be escaped.I was interested in the Chicago settings, since I'm from there, but the environment in Amsterdam and Italy are also very well-done. Jack thinks he can get away from Lucifer by hiding out in Europe, then finds out that even his best-laid plans are laid open for exploitation. I look forward to more thrillers from this author!"
4,Slow outta the Gate,"A bit sluggish and predictable at the start, but once you get past the first few chapters, the characters begin to develop and the plot builds into a page-turnner."
4,Very nice,I wanted some ramekins to make pumpkin custards. I looked at many sets and ordered these as they seemed to be what I wanted. I am very happy with them and use them often.
5,Impress your friends!,I was the hit of the party. My friends were highly impressed by hearing the master himself play. I think I went up three steps on the social ladder with this one. Dale Carnegie would have been proud of me. Now I want to try out the Ravel. Anyone out there heard that one?
5,BUY THIS BOOK!!!,"I rarely offer my review, but I am so impressed with this book, I had to share my thoughts. This is one great cookbook. The recipes are doable, and very delicious. We had a dinner party for 12 last evening, and made 3 recipes from the book and they were a hit. The rocket rolls are light, tasty, maybe the best yeast rolls I've ever made! The corn muffins were very good. And the balsamic vinegar salad dressing recipe is worth the price of the book all by itself!I will recommend this book to anyone who likes to follow well written recipes, and then enjoy a wonderful result!"
3,it was okay,"I bought two of Rebecca Rather's cookbook. This book has lots of mouthwatering pictures but the recipes were just okay. I made the tuxedo cake for my husband's 50th birthday. It was a very pretty cake but the taste is waaaay too plain. It was just a plain chocolate cake with whipped cream...nothing special except for the appearance. Next, the chocolate chip cookie...it was okay. The fruit crostata is just as plain as the peach or pear cobblers. No spices in the fruit just sugar, so figure it out. These need to jazz it up a little by putting cinnamon or nutmeg perhaps. But the Apple Cinnamon loaves is really good! Oh well, you cannot expect everything in the cookbook to be good anyway. I'm sure there is some more good recipes in this cookbook that I haven't tried yet. But so far, this cookbook is just okay for me."
5,Sticky Business,"I purchased this book for my wife. She says: The receipes are easy to follow and delicious. The photos are beautiful and the ""stories"" make it a really fun read. Much better than a ""cookbook."" My wife said that she feels she has a connection with the author and that they could really be great friends. She seems like a really special fun person and it shows in her work. On our next trip to West Texas we plan to stop in Fredericksburg and visit her shop."
2,Keep Looking- this isn't the one.,"First of all, it's not large print as per Amazon's description, and I couldn't find anywhere on the actual Bible where it claimed to be. Secondly, it's boxier than the picture indicates. The spine is actually inverted so that you feel the two outer edges as you are carrying it. I have large male hands and my fingers can't wrap comfortably around it. It will be clumsy and uncomfortable for anyone wanting to stand and chat on the way out of church. I have a NKJ in Giant Print, that is 25% thinner and nests comfortably in my hand, but had been looking for a similar Bible in NAS for a while. Since this one is leather, I thought it would be an upgrade that would end my search. I'll quickly give it away and keep looking, this ISN'T THE ONE!!!"
1,Very disappointed,"I must agree with previous reviewers regarding the picture on the website. It is not the same. However, my biggest gripe is this: Each verse is printed as a new pargraph, even when two verses form one sentence. This makes it very difficult to follow the original thought of the writer. Also the bible is very thick as a result of this wasted printing. I am sadly placing this one on a shelf after I find a better printing."
5,A Bible for a Lifetime,"I chose this bible because I enjoy the NASB translation and wanted a bible that would last a number of years. This bible is well worth the cost. All of the reviews at the time of my purchase provided excellent descriptions. The only color available appears to be black and it has gold gilding (someone else mentioned navy blue, but don't think this is still an option).Love: The OT words in CAPITAL letters in the NT, the buttery soft cover, the single-column wording. So beautiful, I'm carrying a notebook to make my sermon notes in for now (instead of writing in it yet).If you are deciding between this one and the In Touch Ministries NASB calfskin (also on amazon.com), this one has side column references and my understanding is that the other does not. Also the In Touch NASB bible is a two-column page and this is a one-column page."
1,RUN AWAY!!!,"I was recently presented the NASB SCR Calfskin edition at my ordination. Unfortunately my experience w/ this edition was just like others who have reviewed it here. I have never seen such poor workmanship on a $100+ Bible. The cover was separating from the text block as above, and the maps in the back were upside down. The other pastor who was also presented this edition that day also received a defective copy. His cover was attached so poorly that the front portion is significantly smaller than the back, thus when you lay the Bible down on a flat surface, the front cover only overhangs the text block about 1/10th of an inch whereas the back cover overhanges at least 1/2 an inch or maybe even 5/8ths. I would NOT recommend spending your hard earned money on the Calfskin SCR edition from Lockman. It's a shame they are peddling such a poorly constructed product and charging $100+ for it. Buy a Cambridge or R.L. Allan edition if you're looking for a quality NASB, because this isn't it!"
3,Wouldn't buy as a gift,"I've always wanted a Real Leather bible.....and this is very nice leather. It feels very nice to handle and lays open in your hands as you read it very nicely. This is the only thing I am happy with though. The paper the pages are printed on do not seem to be a very nice quality. Wrinkles VERY easily and just don't have a very rich feel to them. Also the gold edging gets marked up and worn very easily. I have also found a few places while reading where the print ink was faded. The print also smudges when highlighting with colored pencils. All in all, I like the way the bible feels but found it to be of low quality in every way. Leather was nice but the construction of the bible and materials used are low quality!"
5,Excellent!,"This Bible was everything that I could expect from it. From the description, I knew fairly accurately what I was going to be getting when I ordered it, but I can say from experience now that it was indeed the right choice for me to make.I was buying this after spending most of my life with an older edition NASB Bible that got worn out. I was looking for:1) NASB2) Margins to take notes in3) Leather4) ReferencesThis Bible has all of that which makes it the one that I selected as well as why I'm satisfied with it. Although I wasn't looking for the calfskin, it is definitely luxurious and a plus. I would definitely recommend considering this Bible along with your other choices!"
2,Not the quality I thought it was.,"This Bible is over 2"" thick and does not have a reinforced spine. The one I received had some of the pages wrinkled and once folded out werer longer than all the others. The one I reordered had pages not attached properly at the top of the spine. This Bible could not stand up to everyday use without the spine breaking. After returning both of these I ordered The NASB (Updated) In Touch Ministry Bible and have been very satisfied."
1,A major disappointment,"I have spent several months trying to find the 2002 American printing to no avail. I am returning this one, as I have returned others from various sources. Foundation Publications really messed up when they outsourced printing of this wonderful bible to China in 2006. Even though you may do your due diligence and call the supplier prior to ordering, the supplier will always tell you it is a 2002 printing, because they did not change the ISBN when they started printing in China. I would not pay $20 for the Chinese version. It truly is junk."
5,Incidentally,"I love this type of music but sometimes get a bit of ""ear-fatigue"" from hearing the same things over and over again.The music from Hamlet is what hooked me here. Love it! Very Scottish!"
4,Great way to get introduced to OAR's non-radio play music,"My first OAR album, although I had heard their music with friends. Definitely recommend this one!"
2,THEIR WORST LIVE ALBUM,"if you want to hear a good O.A.R. live album, go buy Any Time Now.....34th and 8th is pretty good also.This isn't worth owning in comparison to Any Time Now.....honestly."
5,Epitome of Good Live Album,"I loved this album. If you like live music - hearing artists do something a little different with the music/lyrics, and hearing an insane crowd sing along...then you should love this. Has great versions of Crazy Game of Poker, Love and Memories, and many others. Truly great."
3,"Creatures 2, Story 1","Mysterious flying creatures attack and disembowel a young woman and later attack a weather station and its crew. The FBI is sent to the little town of Crystal Wells to investigate, but some members have their own agenda. Local resident and snow tractor driver, Morgan Blaylock, stumbles upon the truth and must battle both the creatures and rogue agent, Richard Case. Case wants to cover up the killings and capture the creatures for his own profit.I gave the book an extra star for the concept of the creatures. They are unique AND bloodthirsty! It would have been a great monster story, but the plot holes and foibles just got bigger and more distracting as the story progressed. But there is a lot of good action and it's a fast moving story."
2,Fine playing - lousy sound quality,"I bought the disc because I wanted to hear what Sanroma did with this piece. From what I can hear he does a fine job. However the sound quality is so poor as to seriously detract from the enjoyment of the music. It has that tinny, scratchy sound that you associate with a well-worn 78 rpm record. In the quiet passages you can hear a rumbling that sounds like a motor running in the background. I have some re-mastered Pablo Casals recordings from the 1930s that sound much better."
3,Poor match,"Purchased for Hummingbird, but piranha 160's base 4 holes did not line up. I ended up drilling new holes, but no hardware was included. My lowrance fish finded Ram Mount came with a base U with SS lock nuts and rubber end caps for the bas mount and again no hardware for the head unit. The end results IT WORKS GREAT. Would be greater if had option of different lengths."
4,Just what I needed.,"The arm is shorter on this one than on the heavy duty model, so less adjustment is possible. Still, it's great quality and exactly as advertised."
2,Poorly made,"I got this for a train set shared by my 5-year-old and 1-year old daughters. It's nice to have a little house to put on the track, and they both play with it a lot.However, the plastic door falls off and needs to be put back on (by parent) several times per hour of active play. The plastic is too soft, or the flanges holding it on are not long enough.Also, the wood parts have very sharp edges and corners. Cheap manufacturing with NO time spent sanding them down or rounding them off. It feels unpleasant and could lead to (minor) injury."
1,Bad Product,"After hours of searching I am still unable to find software for this thing. It includes a Driver CD but the driver does nothing as far as helping you put ringtones on the phone, and the Mybat website offers no suggestions for software. Many of the 3rd party software that claim to support Nokia 6030 phones don't, and the only one that I've found that detects the phone only lets you add or remove text messages and notes. On top of that all the 3rd party software is over $30. Might want to consider just saving your $10 and put it towards a phone that you know will link up to your computer. This product is really not worth your money. It offers in no way a cheaper alternative to add ringtones to your cell phone."
3,"Shoddy cables, but it isn't like you have a choice","A few months ago I purchased one of these cables for use with a Nokia 6030. It worked fine for a while using MobiMB to transfer programs, but one day the cable simply stopped working - it was not even recognized as plugged in by my computer. The vendor would not replace it as it was over 30 days old so I bought another one. This one was seen by my computer, but not by my phone. The vendor sent a replacement for this one though and it works fine...for the moment.So let's face it, these cables won't win any awards for quality. They are clearly bootleg cables that aren't in any way supported by Nokia. However, they are the only cable that works for these models of phones, so if you need to transfer data to them you don't have a choice anyway. The cables are also inexpensive and the vendor's support is responsive, so if you get a faulty one you can always get a replacement.Certainly a shoddy cable, but its cheap and the only game in town."
4,Nokia 6030 USB Connectivity,"I own two of the basic Nokia 6030 - simple, straightforward, and functional. Unfortunately Nokia doesn't make a data cable available for this model, meaning you can't sync or backup stored contacts, etc. I am primarily a Linux user on my computers and the MyBat cable worked ""out of the box"" with 'Gnokii' software on my Linux desktop and laptop computers.I was not so successful with Windows computers: Nokia's PC Suite software would not connect to my phone, with or without the PC software driver provided with the cable. Note that Nokia does _not_ support computer connectivity for the 6030 model. Subsequent research suggests there are two sub-models of the 6030, so my experience may only apply to my model phone.I was very happy with the vendor, 'Accessory Export'. They helped to confirm the cable was the correct model and functioning properly. I would be happy to buy through them another time.Nokia 6030 USB Data Cable and Driver CD Retail Packaged"
1,Very Bad for Nokia 2610,I could not connect my telephone nokia 2610 with this cableI downloaded software from the nokia site and it didn't workI proved several drivers but I could not achieve the conecciónI feel that I lost my money
5,Wonderful,I am really enjoying this book. The historical significance makes it a must read for anyone who considers themselves a horseperson and the art work included is beautiful.
2,"Good pictures, bad translation","I have always enjoyed this book because of its wonderful information and pictures, however this edition is horribly because of the translation. Sorry, but I suggest buying a different book."
2,Functional but disappointed in the size,"When I originally purchased this, the seller stated the size MUCH bigger than this actually is, so I was very disappointed with the size of this for the price. I would not buy another, not for over $21.99. I would say this piece is worth more like $9.99. I was disappointed in the small size."
1,A waste of money!,This DVD was a total waste of money. The very few scenes that tried to be even remotely funny...weren't. Not even the scarce display of female nudity helped this disaster.
3,Okay movie,this movie just reminds me of american pie. but cheaply made. i don't think this was a really good film. it was okay to watch once but twice no.
1,Thank You RedBox,This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made.I feel like i was ripped off even though i only paid a dollar to rent it.Please rent it first before you even think of buying it.I have not reviewed anything on amazon in a long time.But this movie was so bad i felt like i had to write a review.
4,ITS A COMEDY!,"I think this movie is really funny.Like the other dude said, it doesn't really have a plot, but I mean...it's a comedy...the point is to laugh. If I want a movie to move me, I'll watch Ghost."
1,Worst movie ever!!,"Couldn't get past the first 10 mins. glad i only paid 1 dollar to rent but was not even worth that! bad acting, no story don't waste your time money or brain cells on this one!"
2,Piss your drawers funny,"Aubrey o'Day is sexy, sexy, sexy, as Hilary she can be my prom queen anytime. Jillian Murray is good too. I only wish there was more. Over all it's a coming of age film with some hard humor, loved it."
3,"For the actors/budget involved, its a good laugh...?","I hate The Hills, I Hate Laguna Beach, and I hate the people who have gotten famous from them somehow for doing nothing...well I guess alot of coke and shopping...? But with this movie and these actors at least I can watch this and make fun of them. If nothing else there's a bit of eye candy."
1,Difficult to read and understand,This book is meant for scholars and uses alot of jargon. I don't recommend it for the average lay reader.
1,Short Life Span Echo Tunnel,"My 3 yr old had been wanting the pricey Echo Tunnel forever it seemed. We finally got it for his birthday and it did work from the start. Then maybe a few times I heard it go on by itself; Then 1 mo later it officially didnt work at all! I swapped out for new battiers and still didnt work. I returned it to the store I got it and got another, because my sons Loved the Tunnel. Well not even 1 wk later, the ""NEW"" Echo Tunnel has stopped working too! So Im gonna just return to the store since Im still within the 60days and get something else! Hopefully nothing that poisions my kids or is faulty! Whats the deal w/these toys as expensive as they are? What are we paying for??"
1,Sound stopped working (on THREE units),"My son got the Echo Tunnel for Christmas last year, and about a month later, the batteries died. I replaced them with new AA batteries, but the sound would not work anymore. We carefully checked the be sure the batteries were inserted correctly, and tried another brand, but it still would not work. I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one. A month later, the batteries that came with it died, and I replaced them but it wouldn't work again. My 30 day return period with the store had expired, so I had to return it to the manufacturer (at my expense for shipping and they said they would do it this one time only because they recently changed from having a lifetime warranty to only 90 days and that is through the retailer). Well, guess what happened about a month after our THIRD echo tunnel arrived? The batteries died, and after replacing them it never worked again."
3,Problem with echo tunnel is the batteries,"I got one of these for my son and the sound part didn't work from the day I got it. I tried a number of solutions like switching batteries, but nothing helped. A combination of boredom and being ticked led me to call the company. What they said is the just found out that the (+) ends of most brands of AA batteries are not long enough. They recommend buying the silver everready batteries with the black cat on them (and apparently it has to be the silver batteries and not the gold ones). I haven't had a chance to do this yet, but maybe this helps somebody out."
1,Thomas Echo Tunnel Review,"Add our family to the list of disappointed folks with this Echo Tunnel. Same scenario: batteries die, replace them, but Echo Tunnel no longer works. It has sat quietly for over a year, and now I am going to take the Phillips head screwdriver to take it apart, get someone to diagnose it, and see what in the world is the problem. Too many failures reported here. A recall is surely in order. Most Thomas toys work well, are incredibly durable and pleasing to children. This Echo Tunnel is a dud as you will see from other reviews. VERY disappointing, particularly as manufacturer has no admission of problems from everything I've tried to search on Google. Worse, the product itself has no identifier except a very small ""2006 Gullane"" in one small space."
5,great book,For a boy that does not like fiction its wonderfulgood resource after zoo tripsencourages reading as it's not a long sitHe enjoys just sitting and looking and will try to sound out the works to find out about the animalwould recomment this book
1,DO NOT BUY,"I am very disappointed with this alarm clock. Upon arrival it did not keep accurate time, but was persistently slow, even after adjusting the movement to the fastest setting. Since then it has ceased to work consistently; it will sometimes just stop running, until you give it a tap to get it going again. What good is an alarm clock if you can't rely on it?!? The back cover is not securely attached, falling off when handling the clock. The movement is made of PLASTIC. This clock is of VERY poor quality and is a waste of money."
1,You've been warned!,"I thought this was a nice looking little clock, and wanted one for power outtages (which happen a lot where I live)where I could still see the time during the outtage. At first I really liked it, liked the look too. THEN...it started getting really BAD at keeping time..I had to be constantly making adjustments. THEN...when I finally got it to keep reasonable time, it just stopped working. Period. It would run for a while, then stop...run for a while then stop. I strongly recommend looking further for a clock. This was a real disappointment. (it lasted less than a year, and I threw away another 20 bucks!)"
1,I never leave reviews!,"Me and my girlfriend each bought one... Her's deflaited the first trip but we kept trying it. And I thought it was just not pumped up enough. When I finally tried mine, I made sure to pump it up enough and it deflaited on me and my brother on a 2 hr kayak down a calm river!! I was extremely upset because I do my research and only read good reviews about this kayak... Thank God for Dicks 90-day return policy... We are now both looking into Hard Shelled Kayaks... BEWARE Don't mess with inflatables!!!!"
2,shipped without boston valves and beginner's manual,"I received this product in amazon's usual timely manner. However, it was missing the valves to inflate it. It was also missing a manual. It seems that they haphazardly packed up a return or something."
5,"Awesome Book, Actual title is ""God's Dream Team""","If you loved ""God Chasers,"" Tommy's first book, you will also love ""God's Dream Team."""
1,Unity not built on the Cross is not unity,Tenny's book God Chasers was excellent but this book has so much in it that is leading the Body of Christ away from true unity. For someone such as Tenney who evidently has studied the Tabernacle of Moses and the Tabernacle of David the treatment of divine order in this book is pathetic. This book is more harmful than helpful and it is disheartening to read the reviews of others and realize how far we have come from aligning ourselves with the Bible.
3,Good book - just too small,"I was a little disappointed with the size of this book - wish it were bigger. However, it has been useful in our consignment shop."
4,All the energy of the real thing,"I saw this tour at the now defunct Bogarts in Long Beach, and in fact, it was the show they did a couple days before (or after?) the one used for this recording. Though that show went on for almost three hours (!) and this recording is substantially shorter, one nevertheless gets all the energy and the best moments (including Michael slapping out a bass solo) on this excellent recording. Know that it is raw in parts and no overdubbing was done, but for me that just adds to the charm."
4,Michael Been is a god,"I saw this tour at the Bottom line in NYC. They played an amazing show. Michael Been has such a great voice and writes beautiful lyrics. It was like seeing the band play in my living room. Listening to this disc brought me back to that show 10 years ago....Music needs more groups like the Call. Never a big MTV hit, the Call blow away all the ""boy bands"" of today...."
3,"Vivid Bullfighting Scenes, Moving Drinkfest","A tremendously poignant foray into the adrift lives of Americans in Europe. I liked the vivid portrayal of bullfighting and the almost dizzying descriptions of drinkfests too numerous to recount. It took me five times over the past 20 years to finish this book: it was too fuzzy. But as I grow older, it is easier to appreciate the existential drift of many of Ernie's characters. Too bad we can't live lives like this anymore.... too bad the lost generation was found. One final note: more interesting ways to drink were defined in this book than any I have read in years."
5,I want to go trout fishing on the Irati River.,"Critics of this novel may cite that the characters are aimless, idle, and unworthy. Though simple in nature, The Sun Also Rises thrives on the desire to go trout fishing in Spain, the satisfaction of cocktails at dusk, and the longing for sincere love. Look deep within this novel and you will regret that only a lifetime remains to digest its contents"
4,Multifaceted characters + real-life truths + food = Wonderful!,"Lord Julian Endicott is at the edge of starvation due to a longstanding depression brought on by grief at the loss of his beloved wife and child in childbirth. Jeannette Saincoeur's task as the new chef-on-trial is to reawaken his appetite. She enters into a campaign to bring light, beauty, and cheer back into his home in order to reawaken his will to eat--and live. At the same time, this French emigree tackles her own demons which include having a father (an historical figure) who botched the escape from France of Louis XVI & Marie Antoinette (an historical event). This story is interesting, substantive, unusual, well-written, and clean."
1,sound out of synch,I downloaded this from unbox and the sound was out of synch from the images by about 7 seconds. Almost impossible to watch. Maybe this was just a corrupted download...I would have liked to try again but I couldn't find an option for this.
5,Good hammer holder,This is one helluva hammer holder. I has a large top opening that allows my hammer to enter easily. I have gone through many hammer holders in my years of construction. This one however has held up for the past year trough our great Candian winter and all. A product deserving of the DeWalt name.
5,Very Enjoyable Baby Book,"This book is an interesting format: It is actually a book glued into a sort of ""box"" formed by four flaps that fold out in all four directions. First, you open the first flap (which is secured by velcro) to see Barney's face. He tells you to ""turn the page and find the color yellow."" You open the downward flap, and there are Barney's yellow toes! ""Turn the page and find the color blue."" Open the right flap, and Barney's hand is holding a blue car! My 13-month-old son's favorite is ""Brown--Teddy Bear."" He opens the book and shuts it many times so he can play peekaboo with the bear. In the center, there are a lot more pages you can turn to find colors. The last color is green--you turn the page, and there is Barney's green, fuzzy tummy for you to pet!This is definitely a great hands-on book for a baby or toddler."
5,glaring friedlander,"After spending the last 15 yrs. looking through Friedlanders photographs, I rate this book equal to ""The American Monument"", his tour de force. No photographer has ever visualized the desert ""forest"" as he has. He photographs the harshness of the desert light along with the harshness of its plants with his new format, the ultrawide Hasselblad. The combination of technique and his unique vision make this book groundbreaking for this artist."
1,I already wrote a review / where is it ?,Do you only put on positive reviews ? This book was awful and I think people should know about it. My review was not pornographic or offensive in any way - where is it ?
3,Good Instruction,"Johnnie Lilidale, Is a well known artist, who has taught for a very long time. You will have to sit through the first part when she is talking about things, and I must say, I fall asleep everytime. I guess she has this way of talking with not too many hi and low moments in her speech. BUT, it is a good series to have in a painting library. I gave it 3 star's for that reason, but her art is 5 star, if not more."
5,How does one measure the quality of an album?,"One way to measure the quality of an album is it's singability. By no means am I a singer, but when I'm alone in the car with this album playing, I can't help but singalong with Gary Brooker at the top of my lungs on every track. (Those high notes during the chorus of ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"" are a definite challenge, however!)The instrumental ""Repent Walpurgis"" even has me singing the notes.For Procoholics everywhere, the bonus tracks are an interesting sidelight. For everyone else, this is the perfect introduction to a band I'm glad to say is my very favorite. (I'm 46, by the way, and have listened to a lot of music.)I'd recommend the new listener buy the group's albums in chronological order and experience a marvelous musical and lyrical evolution...not to mention a real treat. The lyrics are like any good poetry, not necessarily representative of anything but magically evocative. The music will stay with you forever."
4,love is in the air,One of my favorite Christmas movies. Surprising way of presenting a good love story. I heartily recommend to anyone who likes Christmas love stories.
4,Silver Bells - Hallmark Hall of Fame Dvd,"Another excellent Hallmark Christmas movie to add to your library. I am continually impressed with the number of superb family movies that Hallmark makes each year. This story takes place in New York where a dysfunctional family is trying to find a way to make amends and put others before themselves. A wonderful cast, great story, excellent scenery and sets, and impeccable directing make it one for the Christmas list and at least a yearly viewing during the holidays. If you enjoyed this be sure to seeSanta Jr..CA Luster"
1,Save your time and money; the speakerphone on my cellphone works better,"I read the reviews for this device and got excited. My colleague and I thought, ""Finally! Something that will work better than the mediocre speakerphone on my cellphone!"" I received this device, and while pairing it with my cellphone was simple (to this product's discredit, pairing bluetooth devices with my phone is always simple...), the product sucks. I just got off a phone call - third time I've used this device with the same result - and 2 minutes into the call had to switch to my phone's speakerphone so I could understand what the other people were saying. While the device does produce loud enough output, the output is full of static, jumbled and indaudible. Save your money and either buy something better or settle for your phone's built-in speakerphone; this thing is an expensive piece of crap. Very, very disappointing."
1,Beware before you buy,"Bought this about a year ago with hope to hear better than the Motorola device I have.Well - the pairing and clarity with my Blackberry was not the best, to say the least. Backround noise and not very clear.The worse part was that the unit fell off the visor every time I took a turn. It's big and bulky and seems too heavy to hold on with the latch on the back of the unit. Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor. Now it's sitting in the clove compartment of my Honda CR-V and I'm back to the old Motorola smaller unit.Tried to use it with my home phone as a speaker and was disappointing and not happy at all.One would think that the big zise will produce a clear and nice sound - which proves to be a big disappointment. I wish I could return the unit and get back my money. There are better products in the market which are smaller, with clear sound and stable on the visor."
2,Unimpressed,"Bought this hoping it would work well in my Miata. First problem is this thing is huge compared to competing products out there. It is so big it blocked part of my view when mounted on the sun visor. I tried it for one day and decided it was unacceptable.The size might be acceptable if it had excellent sound. In a word, it doesn't. The sound is pitifully weak considering the size of this thing. I strained to hear it when the car was in motion. Even trying it as a desktop speaker phone I had to lean forward to comfortably hear it.All in all, very unimpressed."
2,Was easy to set up but sound quality is lousy.,It was easy to set up and sync but the sound quality is poor and the charge does not last as long as it says.
3,Not Good,I really wasted my money on these. They do not work well at all. You either have to keep them charged or have a dumb cord hanging down from the visor and into the cigarette lighter outlet. Speaker is bad and sound quality is bad.
5,So well done!,"I bought this exact Spracht back in 2007 and never used it. Plugged it in today, and not only did it hold its charge -- it worked perfectly with my MacBook Pro and Skype. Just like that.The pairing instructions are on the bottom, so you never lose them. It's really easy to use. I haven't yet tried it as a speaker phone in a conference room, but I bet it works well there, too."
1,speakerphone,"I wish I knew the Amazon return policy! I didn't realize that it was so short for electronics. I would have returned it the day after I opened it. The speakerphone feature of it was difficult to hear sometimes.... so not very loud at all. In conversations with the individual on the other end, they said that it was difficult for them to hear me (I tried with a couple of calls to different individuals). I was very disappointed."
1,Echoes when used in a small conference room,"Was extremely disappointed with this product. I bought it based on the good reviews at amazon. However, it echoes very badly when connected to headset jack of a cordless or corded phone using cable provided by company. Echo is bad enough to make it almost useless.To be fair, have not tried bluetooth yet - but I dont expect any change. If anything, bluetooth should make it worse, not better.Please see the ""shill"" comments on the good reviews. Buyers beware."
1,Doesn't work in a car,"This is a gizmo apparently intended to take the place of a speaker phone for conference calls. It didn't work for what I wanted to use it for and I returned it to Amazon. I am certain there will be folks that find that they can find a purpose for this device. I didn't. I love electronic and gadgets, but they have to have a specific function. I just didn't get the purpose of this one."
2,Who Cares About Spare Cables,"The clip was cheaply made and the one and off button worked sporadically.Call quality was good when it worked, but too much trouble to turn on/off.I returned it and ordered a Sony for $120 with much better consumer reviews"
5,Great Hands Free Device,Works very well. Reception is good and people can hear me when I talk to them. Very easy to use.
4,amended review,"it was really hard to pair this device with my Bb, but once I did, the performance was pretty good. nothing great, but pretty good. it does the simple job I need it to do."
1,Needs work,"I purchased the Spracht AURA hands free speakerphone 12 months ago. The unit was rather large but had great speakers and good voice pick up. A plus for a noisy carThe style is very dated and the battery life is horrible. I am in my car most of the day and averaged about 6 hours per battery charge in standby mode and much less if I am actively using it. I have since purchased a different brand due to the extremely short battery life. If you can keep it plugged into your charger, it is a great speakerphone."
2,Kinda disappointed,"Wanted a speaker phone mostly for my home office that provided better sound and a better mike than my $30 phone. The speaker part is actually pretty good. The mike part is not nearly as good. I constantly get an echo and have people tell me the quality, while not horrible, is not even as good as the built in mike. There is a solution to the echo that works somewhat (see directions), but its annoying and has to be done seemingly each call, I just want to set the speaker and forget it.It does synch up with my blackberry fine, seems ok, better than the blackberry speaker (which is not saying much). Overall, I really was going to send it back, but time just slipped away and now I own it. Its ok for just listening to those 2 hour conf calls, so that is what I use it for. Never tried it in the car, not really interested in that so know nothing about sound quality or batter life."
5,"Very simple,Very clever, Very funny","This book is for dog lovers and kids. Its great pictures and simple phrases exactly describes what our black lab does (right down to the 'worried' look on her face!), and therefore we found this book very funny. However we have shown this book to non dog lovers. They just give polite smiles/puzzled looks and change the subject!! So I guess if you know what catagory your in you'll know whether or not this book is for you!"

2,Old Jess Done Tanked With This One,"I have the uncut Euro version of 99 Women and have seen Barbed Wire Dolls, and this is his worst women in prison film. Ursula Fellner is this movies' only saving grace. Blue Underground did their usual good job on the transfer to DVD. There were no surprises here. I thought that the sex was somewhat muted in comparison to the other films I had already mentioned. Probably an OK rental but that is about it. Charlie S."
2,Not Bad For What It Was,"OK, no one will confuse this with Citizen Kane but you've got to love a movie where the women are always topless. There are a few catfights and some kinky sex as well. On the other hand I hope they didn't overpay the guy who wrote the dialogue. Here's a prime example. After one of the captive girls dies:""This is terrible. It reminds me of the day Zenobia died""""A relative?""""No, my favorite cow.""I guess they saved some money on the script and blew it on great special effects like that plastic crocodile. I will say that it took me three sittings to make it through this fine work of art, never a good sign. I guess that's what happens after a while when everything looks the same. I hope the folks waiting to rent it next didn't get too impatient. Don't worry folks, it's on it's way."
5,I agree,"I'm with both of these reviewers. This is a very fine book for any recruiter, but the greatly expanded 2008 edition is the one to get. I have both, and it was absolutely worth it to get the new one. This book is without a doubt excellent;it's just that the new one is even better."
5,Liked,"Bought this mold and the chess/checker board mold from the same company. Worked well. The cake was made for a birthday party and was a huge hit! It didn't come with instructions, so read up on making them if you are unsure. I filled the molds with chocolate and froze them until the were solid. I set those aside and made a fresh set. While those were freshly poured, I put the solid one on top to combine them as one piece. Pop back in the fridge or freezer. Washing with luke warm water to not warp the plastic and not scrubbing to hard to avoid scratching were useful info too."
1,Unhappy.,"Received in a timely manner, that's the only true positive thing. The tray is warped and won't sit evenly, and the top edge of the bottom rook is pushed in, making removal of the piece nearly impossible without damaging the candy."
3,Not for soap molding-Still great for candy.,This is a great item for chocolate. I gave it to my freind who's a pastry chef.It was a nightmare for my usage. Very cool other than that.
4,Great looking (and tasting) chess pieces!,"Bought this for my son's chess birthday cake. The molds were easy to use and I was very happy with the end result. It isn't flawless where the two halves come together, but maybe if I had more practice with chocolate molds it would have worked better."
3,Fun,Bought this to make a chocolate chess set. Should have gotten two because they needed to be cooled and then each side needed to be connected. Harder to make than I thought... I would think twice about how much effort you want to put into these chess candies. Price was great and it shipped on time.
2,Not as versatile as a cordless vacuum!,"I wanted to like this product. I looked forward to its arrival. The day it came, I unpacked it and raced to sweep my kitchen. Unfortunately, I was let down from the very first sweep. Whether on ""auto"" or ""manual"" setting, I have to almost knock the front of the unit with my broom to get it to turn on. Once on, the suction lasts 5 seconds during which I have to furiously try sweeping the debris in. Even then, it does not get it all.I suppose if I had back problems this might be a true boon -- until it came time to clean the unit, that is. In the meantime, I've reverted to using my broom and my cordless vacuum to accomplish the same thing... and I gave this unit to a friend who hasn't shelled out for her own cordless vacuum yet."
3,Big sound.,"I bought this to keep around the birds cages. However, the sound when I use it freaks them out. Also, it's disturbing to anyone watching TV.Other then that it works great."
3,only got it for Adam Ant...,The movie is your typical cheesy horror movie. I was pretty disapointed because Adam Ant's part is very small (you don't see him until the very end- but his charactor is mentioned thru the movie)but he is definately the best part. As usual he steals the spotlight away from everyone else in the scene with him. It also has Richard Blade who was a famous DJ in LA for KROQ. He's pretty funny in the movie. Would I watch it at all if Adam Ant wasn't in it? Nope. But if you collect movies with him in it- I'd recommend it. He looks very handsome in it and he's very charming. He is a GREAT bad guy.
2,Typical 80s horror movie,"Not a bad movie for when it was made but compared to special effects nowadays its pretty cheesy. Very little gore, no nudity and no scares."
1,Spellcaster,"The VHS Spellcaster was defective. I returned it, 8-2-3010. I am still waiting for my refund."
1,You should have a 0 star as well!,"3 Piece Starter Kit for Samsung i730NONE of the 3 pieces were for the i730the case was for a flip phone (FAR FOR THE i730 PDA phone)the ""charger"" even though it fit the phone it does NOT CHARGE itand the ear piece is a piece of >>>>"
5,The Islands in your Home,Jim West provides his listeners with a well composed group of songs. Each song is well tuned and is very Hawaiian. He keeps his music true to the laid back sounds of the slack key and does not add any thing artificial to his music.
1,The Reviews Say It All,Hype and hucksterism at its finest.the book is severely lacking in useful information despite accolades to the contrary.
4,Much like Market Wizards,"Much like Market Wizards the book is an interview of traders that made big bucks.The author (young trader) capitalized on the Market Wizards format by creating another interview book. (make money any way you can) It does have some good insights and is worth the USED price.Now I want to ""write"" one of the books and cash in too! :-)"
5,Expects to do very well,This book should go from strength to strength. The chapters are exceptionally good. I have become a Patel fan and have ordered his Trading Online book today. Great reading.
3,"Good, but I expected more.","A really good book for gaining an insight into what makes a trader tick. Quite a few reviews from many ""BIG"" names in the trading business. Could have done without the reviews on the back cover written by the contributors (does not do the book justice, who was the marketing genius behind this move ?). Quite a few parallels drawn between different traders, so you appreciate the qualities of the truly ""sucessful"" traders. Also, a few typos in the earlier part of the book. Expected more from the FT."
3,"The like title says, it's all psychology","The book is great for those looking to begin their careers in trading, but don't look for trading strategies. On the other hand, psychology is the most important aspect of trading. The book is also well written."
2,an average book at best,"I bought this book largely on the basis of others' reviews of it. After reading it I have to say that the book is somewhat dissapointing. There is nothing in this book that most do not already know. It is not that the author's points are not good, but rather that many of the same points are repeated over and over again. Unfortunately, much of these points are observations most people know, such as...cut your losses, use stop losses, don't risk so much that you can't trade tomorrow, etc, etc. I would highly recommend that others save their money and purchase something else."
3,"Ok, but there are certainly better books out there","I was somewhat disappointed in this book in that it separated me from the traders interviewed. Many times the author tried to provide a summary of the trading psychology. However, I was left wondering if the author really knew what he was doing. On this topic, I would look to other books."
1,Spamming reviews?,"I was reading the reviews of The Electronic Day Trader by Marc Friedfertig, George West and George Piecznik and found several pitches for this book. There were also several pitches for The Mind of a Trader, repeated at regular time intervals. Curiously, they are both by Patel."
1,Bought 2 months ago & haven't bothered finishing,"This book might be ok for those who are looking for a history lesson, but not much more. I found little, if anything, in the first several chapters that will make any difference in my approach to the market."
5,Brilliant,"This book is packed thick with information, knowledge and wisdom. Wonderfully well written and a joy to read.I trade for a living and this book is a must-read for any serious and decent trader."
5,BMW OEM front floor matts,"Great original BMW floor matts, great reseller with quick shipping. Only issue was that the floor matts did not come with the necessary hardware (Special hook that screws in the floor, in place of the removable Velcro) to keep the flloor matt in place.So I had to make a trip to my local BMW dealer and the clerk was friendly and said ""while these hooks are usually packaged with the matts, he has some laying around and would give it to me at no charge"" So once I had the hooks, the matts stayed on nicely and did not move around.In my 2008 535xi, the summer floor matts are held in place by a ""round screw in velcro plate"" on the floor. So I used a quarter to unscrew the Velcro piece and instead put in place the hook supplied by the dealer, which is necessary and did not ship with the floor matts."
4,Not as thick as they used to be,"I received these and was surprised by the weight. Just ONE of my 7 yr old BMW rubber matts weighed as much as both of the new ones. I am skeptical about wear and tear on these. They appear to be genuine BMW and came to me from a BMW dealership in Denver, but the weight is concerning. The rubber is clearly thinner and the back side of the matt has much less foundation and rubber then the older pair that lasted 7 years before dry rotting. I hope they last. Otherwise, they look great and are very functional. I live near the beach so they are super easy to clean."
4,"Cheap and useful, but cheap","Not too bad.If you reach into your pocketbook and find out you need to save some money, then this book offers a inexpensive substitute for the slightly pricer trendsetters (TRANSITION MAGICIAN and TRANSITION MAGICIAN 2).The two page introductiong educates the teacher on how to self-assess whether her classroom stands as ""transition ready""."
1,Get the UK version...,"...and tell CBS Paramount you dislike the fact that they are ripping you off!!!Moreover, seasons 5 AND 6 are available in the UK with season 7 scheduled in the Fall."
1,Petty indeed!,"Thanks to the other reviewer for the UK tip, indeed all 6 seasons are available for less than 20 USD each, and they are all whole seasons!I COULD maybe understand releasing half seasons with a delay between each, but releasing two half seasons on the same day is plain abusive to the fans they know will buy anything. So stick you! I'm off to amazon.co.uk! ;)"
4,"A great set, although a little expensive for casual use","These screwdrivers are as good as screwdrivers get, period. The big, three sided handles are easy to grip, and they're made out some kind of hard, tough, rubbery stuff that won't slip in sweaty hands. You can really crank out the torque with these things. Three of the largest flat bladed ones have bolsters right below the handles where you can also use a wrench to get even more torque. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because I thought they were a little expensive for casual use around the house, but if you've got a job where you use screwdrivers alot they're worth the money."
1,Less than one year of use,I advise anyone to NOT buy Harbinger products. I bought these straps less than a year ago and one of them began to fray about a month ago. Last week when I was doing upright barbell rows that strap ripped in 1/2 as I was doing upright barbell rows. Ended up hurting my back because of this. I wrote Harbinger to get them replaced and was informed they only give a 90 day warranty. I've gotten Abercrombie and Fitch to replace shorts I owned longer than that when they tore.Disappointed with the quality of these straps and the company itself. Try a different brand.
5,AWESOME BOOK,I have the book on audio cd. I really enjoyed the book. I really gives you insight on the mind of the Anti Christ. Once again this is an awesome book. I highly recommend this book to any one who enjoys bible prophecy.
5,TEVIN CAMPBELL,"BACK TO THE WORLD IS AN EXCELLENT PROJECT RECORDED AND SOME PRODUCED AND WRITTEN BY TEVIN! IT HAS SEVERAL GREAT SONGS ON IT. I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT IT DIDN'T GET A LOT OF AIRPLAY OR THAT IT DIDN'T HAVE MANY SONGS RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC. IF I'M NOT MISTAKING I THINK THIS CD HAS ""DANDELION"" ON IT. THAT IS REALLY A SPECIAL SONG AND IS WELL ARRANGED. I'M TOTALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE SPANISH VERSION OF IT. TEVIN REALLY DOES A COMMENDABLE JOB ON THIS ONE. HIS VOICE IS SO STRONG AND CONFIDENT. AND AS USUAL, HE DOESN'T MISS A BEAT. HIS VOICE IS SO WELL TRAINED HE KNOWS HOW TO DELVER ANY SONG HE GIVES US. HE IS SUCH AN AMAZING ARTIST AND A MAN OF MANY SKILLS AND TALENTS! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE! I RATE IT A PERFECT 5!"
3,OK,This album is Tevin's third installment. He previous albums was well accepted and sold well. This album (Back to the World) was a coming of age album. Tevin had reached maturity and he voice had evolved. What was kinda of funny was I seen him perform Tommorrow on a tribute show to Quincy Jones and he totally changed the way he sang it because his voice had changed. I think he did a terrific job on that and on Back to the world.
5,Par Cans 56's Polished,I'm a musician from way back and my years of experience with sound and lighting equipment I chose this set up for short throw. They work very well for the application that I wanted. The vender was very prompt in getting my shipment on such short notice.. It all worked out very well
5,Fantastic Read!,"I am very impressed with this book. As an avid reader, I found Mr.Janke's book to be not only inspiring, but immensly helpful as well. I enjoyed the stories and ancient diet and nutrition information. I was also impressed with this books layout and cover design. I highly recommend this book - thanks."
5,POWERFUL INFORMATION,"The information written in this publication is POWERFUL and OUTSTANDING! The material motivates you to take action and to follow through. Any goal can be accomplished when applying this information to your life. Finally, I started a small daily exercise and a healthier eating routine using this inspirational information and within one month, I lost fifteen pounds and close to two inches in the waist."
5,So Paulo Scene You Never Knew Existed... Brasil,"Wow ! Track 3@4 are ok and take some getting use to, but all 18 tracks are wow ! Punk there is, but it seems to me it is 80's all the way. A must and get ready. Check out the liners.Arturo, NYC"
1,"another silly, false re-hash of Josephus","When are historians going to spring free of the bible's propaganda, and the questionable verities of Josephus, and find the far more complex story of the vast Herodeia Family? New archaelogical research by Millar, Bowersock, and Finkelstein, just as a few examples, show that ancient non-biblical texts contemporary with Herod and the fictional ""Jesus Christ' at the same time were much more aware of Herod Philip II as a real-life model for the Messiah who rebuilt Solomon's Temple and re-united Israel and Judah."
5,"Encyclopedic in scope, THE book to have","This book is the handiest quick reference for dispelling pro-Jesus arguments. Gets down to the point, but has lots of in depth analysis too. A must have for Jews in general and particularly useful for those who enjoy being ""counter-missionaries"". Get it"
1,Poor exegesis,"Sigal has a tendency to try to define words in the English context while not following through deeper into the Hebrew context of the word. Best way to read his work is with a lexicon or concordance in hand, to cross reference what he is saying and get the real hebrew definition as opposed to what he is offering, which is often out of context."
1,worst music dvd ever,"Music does not sync with the rotten out of focus video shot behind people's heads. Terrible video probably even for its time. You would have to be a tripping Dead Head to even start to watch this. I love music videos but this is the worst I have ever scene, included CD is of poor quality as well though it looks a work of art compared to the DVD."
1,A Complete Waste of Money,"Aside from the cover art, this is the most poorly produced DVD I have ever seen being sold. Not only is the audio out of sync with the video as described above, but there is such a limited amount of Grateful Dead video footage from this festival, that the same video clips are recycled and played over and over again. The footage is shot from a distance with a shaky hand on an unfocused camera. I wouldn't even watch a youtube video containing this footage. My friend is a big festival fan of the 1970 time period. He purchased this thinking he was going to see lots of cool, live footage of music from this festival. After watching it once, he was going to throw it out, but he gave it to me so that I could warn others of its contents. Unless you don't mind throwing money in the garbage, avoid purchasing this DVD. You will first feel disappointed, then cheated, angry and you will want your money back; Guaranteed.Hollywood Festival North West England 1970"
1,"Oh, Spike & Mike, what has happened to you?","Well, the stop-action furniture piece was somewhat amusing, beyond that, there is nothing I can really recommend here. Poor concepts, poor execution, and yes, flash animation you can get for free online (Happy Tree Friends). Don't waste your time or money friends, this is a clunker! in The early 90s, Spike & Mike used to be a must-see showcase of animation, but this...bottom of the barrel."
1,NOT better than the first,"This sequel has got to be the dumbest sequel since Caddyshack II. Junior and Ben Healey move to a house which has the address of ""911"" There, Junior meets a girl rather like him."
2,"Good Movie, when on TV and edited",I used to watch this movie all the time on TV and loved it! I then got the video and was absolutely shocked! I couldn't believe how much needed to be edited for TV. The barfing scene was horrible and the kids swore a lot. I don't see why they had to have those things in it in the first place. I watched it for years as the edited version and it is much better.
1,Pretty Awful,"I suppose, if you loved the first movie and enjoy really tasteless, third-grade level humor, you might enjoy this. It had a few small moments of being actually funny, but in general it was a poor, silly, and not very funny movie. A large part of the plot rests on the viewer's compassion for the two main children in the movie, and neither were anything but completely annoying. I enjoy slapstick comedy, but this was a failure. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Its only possible merit is John Ritter, who gives a mediocre, but not awful, performance."
3,Beautiful prop and set design. A must see!,See this movie for the set and prop work. Exquisite work was done in Florida by local artists on a shoestring budget. I hear the employees in the art department raked in only $300.00 a week to work 15 hour days. That's love and commitment for you. The movie was fair.
3,a good outline for a live show,"What we have here is Nashville twang, lacaonic vocals and relaxed Texas swing. The playing is first rate the songs stronger than expected from an indie release and I figure it sets us up for a more energetic live performance. It looses a star as I'm not keen on the sing/speak approach in the slower songs. All in all a nice surprise from an artist I just stumbled on."
4,Story Teller,If you enjoy a good story in your song and have Merle Haggard or Joe Prine in your collection you'll want to give Hair Cut a listen.
1,Candy So Old It Could Be Sold As Antique,After reading the previous review I though I would still take a chance and order this and see what I got. I got the same thing. An obviously opened case with candy bars so old they should be in a museum. I will make sure I never order anything that is sold by Annabelle Candy Co. Looks like they dump what no one else would buy through Amazon. Amazon really should stop allowing Annabelle Candy to sell through them if they value their reputation.
2,ABBA-ZABA - Old Product,"Being an old school guy (born in 1950) I was pleased to find BIG HUNKS could be purchased through Amazon. I purchased 48 in two 24 bar boxes, one box was old product shrink rapped with one box ok. I'm sure Annabelle knows thier unloading out of date product because I purchased 48 ABBA-ZABBA bars in two boxes of 24 two weeks later and the same thing happened again, in one box the peanut butter filing was rancide and the other box was old but ok. Be warned that in my case old stock was unload on me and maybe you too."
1,Defective Product,"Instead of being an original Vista version, Acer builds these using Windows XP. In other words, yes it's a Vista machine, but the hard drive is formatted using Windows XP. This makes it behave like an upgrade from XP instead of an original Vista install, which causes problems in some operations.My computer also was incapable of downloading from the internet. This problem couldn't be solved in the hours I spent on the phone with their poor tech support. I returned it for a refund. Acer said they're sending it to Taiwan to figure out what's wrong with it."
2,Work Great! Until they break.,"I hate leaving a negative review for these. I have had them for over a year, and I liked them so much that I got my Dad a pair. Unfortunately, his broke immediately. I wasn't sure what happened, but the image was misaligned, so you couldn't focus on anything. I assumed it was a fluke. He sent them back under warranty and they sent him a new pair (for a fee, not sure what it was).Turns out it wasn't a fluke. I dropped these about about 2.5 feet in the case recently. I didn't think it was a big deal, although I never want to drop a precision instrument like these. I look through them, and they are misaligned. My conclusion is that these things are just not durable. Any abuse and they will break.They work beautifully until they break though."
1,disappointed,"I like the book, however, I'm just slightly irritated that this is just a reprint of an earlier book entitled ""Lighting the Seventh Fire: The Spiritual Ways, Healing, and Science of the Native American"".I didn't need another copy of the book."
2,I returned this too.,"This tool bag is not big enough. I wanted to get 2 or 3 of them and store my 18 volt set in them. This bag is not big enough to put one Dewalt cordless finish nailer in it. The height of the bag won't accommodate a normal sized screwdriver or channel-locks to be stored vertically in the pockets with the lid closed. The interior and outside pockets are too blousey. They should build a larger, foot locker type version with the same hard-sided/bag idea, but actually make it usable.I returned this."
1,The blade changing instructions are terrible,I'm quite mechanically adept and couldn't figure it out. I can't believe that Stanley handicapped this product and their brand by not doing a better job on the instructions.This review gives great instructions on how to change the blade. http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MG0YO1V5ELTD/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B000051WTG&nodeID;=&tag;=&linkCode;=
1,Do not buy!,"... It does not work and I'm not sure how they can even sell it? First off, I couldn't get it to accept a blade. The yellow button wouldn't press in and the top push button wouldn't push all the way forward. After 10 minutes of agony, I decided to take it apart and manually put the blade in. No go, it wouldn't close properly and blade stuck out at its close position. The blade would wobble a bit also, making this tool completely useless. After picking up all of parts that were all over my shop (after it was thrown against the wall) and putting it back together, I did like the feel of the product. Nice weight and good comfort. But if I can't even get it to work manually, it's going back. I can't believe a company like Stanley would make such a ... product. Don't they do field tests?"
2,Research Needed to Use this Blade,I rated this low because I don't feel I should have to go online and do a search just to figure out the secret tricks to insert a blade in this utility knife. Thanks to those who posted the correct procedure as they saved me the hassle of returning it. I would think this would be easy for Stanley to correct and save us this frustration but it hasn't happened yet.
1,Very disappointing tool,"Extremly disappointing tool, the blades got stuck shortly after purchasing it and I can't even open them to replace it. Really a waste of money."
1,Do not buy this product!,"The cutter comes with no useful instructions about inserting or removing blades. Trying for 15 minutes, I could not make the seemingly helpful instructions provided by an Amazon reviewer work; the blade wouldn't fit in, and eventually I stopped, afraid I'd cut myself on the very sharp blade, fooling with it. This a dangerous tool, and it should be avoided. I have returned my cutter to Amazon for a refund."
2,Blade Change Can Be A Problem,"The instructions provided by other reviewers are correct as far as loading and unloading a blade. Mine seemed to work just fine for the first few months after I purchased it.For some reason, the blade change is no longer such a cinch. Taking the blade out is usually no problem. However, the blade often is difficult to install, even with the ""slider button"" pushed all the way forward and down and while pushing the blade release (yellow button) fully. This is unfortunate, since the knife is otherwise solid. The angle or contour of the handle is just right, it fits comfortably in the hand, and you can get a strong grip on the handle.I have been generally pleased with Stanley hand tools and will continue to purchase them. However, this one did not perform as advertised, at least not for me, and so I recommend that you avoid this one."
4,Must have utility knife,I concur the instructions sucks....had the utility knife for about 2 yrs and could not figure out how to use it so I stuck it in my tool box. Recently I stumble upon the utility knife and googled it...found out how to operate this thing on YouTube.... all I can say now is that I really like this utility knife. I can understand some of the negitive reviews. Once you get the hang of swapping out the blades you will appreciate it!!!!
4,GOOD PRODUCT,THE BLADES ARE GOOD BUT THE KNIFE IS TOO HEAVY AND CHANGING THE BLADES SEEMS TO BE DIFFICULT SO IF YOU DON'T MIND THIS PROBLEMS YOU CAN BUY THIS PRODUCT
1,Blade change failed first week.,"Pressing the yellow button no longer releases the blade on mine. Blade removal was always difficult, requiring several tries, and now the blade cannot be removed no matter what. I think the yellow blade removal depressor is made from an inferior plastic that is not up to the job. When it still worked, it was inconvenient to use, as removing the spare blade took one compartment opening and replacing the in-use blade took another step. Both involved plastic parts that were difficult to use and prone to failure.Like so many imports, it was nice while it worked.I replaced it with a Kobalt 50074. all metal utility from Lowes. It is all metal construction and sliding one button opens the knife for blade change and access to the spare blades. It also fits my hand much better."
2,Not so 'instant',"While the tips presented by other reviewers work, at times, I still believe the instant change feature is not reliable enough. I've been frustrated too many times, because the blade won't come out easily. Then, when I try to change the blade like any other utility knife (by opening it up), I get even more frustrated because the two halves of the knife do not easily come apart. The knife wasn't designed to be opened, because it has the 'instant' change feature. When the instant change feature works, it's great; it just doesn't work 100% of the time."
1,"Good Design, Horrible Execution","The instructions given above would work if the sliding button would stay locked in place. When the blade is inserted with the yellow button completely pushed in, the blade still forces the slider back and unlocks it. The blade will then not insert any farther. This is a horrible tool and no one should purchase it."
2,Keep looking,"Thanks, Eric for the step-by-step instructions. I threw out my knife's packaging ages ago and had to search the web for tips on how to do the blade exchange. Even now, I'd say if you want a good utility knife, keep looking. The blade release button is hard to push, there's no way to know if it's been pushed in far enough, and the blade is still reluctant to come out/go in. Back to the drawing board Stanley!"
1,Very dangerous product,The blade does not retarct all the way in. It will cut your finger when you search for it in your tool box. The blase also slide out even without pushing the blase release button - this is extreamly dangerous.
1,Nothing but problems,"Frustrating beyond words is how I describe the two cutters I bought. Neither would take the blade and hold it securely in place. Now I know why there was another knife in the display that looked like it too had been returned. If you buy this product, save the packaging and receipt."
1,"Blade removal feature awkward, then failed.","Even before it failed, it was inconvenient to use, as removing the spare blade took one compartment opening and replacing the in-use blade took another step. Both involved plastic parts that were difficult to use and prone to failure.Pressing the yellow button no longer releases the blade on mine. Blade removal was always quirky, taking multiple attempts, and finally, the blade cannot be removed no matter what. I think the yellow blade removal depressor is made from an inferior plastic that is not up to the job.I took it back for a replacement, but the second one was not much better.It replaced it with a Kobalt 50074 from Lowes. It is all metal construction and sliding one button opens the whole knife for blade change and access to the spare blades. It also fits my hand much better, and does not threaten blisters after a whole day of using it."
3,"Thank you, Eric P!","It took an hour to figure out how to get the cardboard the knife was shipped in out of the knife...and then we couldn't figure out how to get the blade in! We were about to give up when we read Eric P's directions. Worked like a charm. Would it be so hard to put that on the package instead of all the junk that WAS there? Huh?Now that it's loaded and ready for use, it appears to be a good heavyweight durable box cutter."
3,We're all perplexed as to why this knife is sold like this...,"I have to thank Eric P. for clearly showing how to replace blades for this knife, because as many other reviewers have stated, ""there are no directions"" in the package and using this knife is NOT intuitive. I also agree that it is hard to believe that Stanley Bostich has the nerve to sell this product like this.But then I also have a Stanley Bostich stapler and IT also had no directions and I had to call the company to get instructions for using it. Something is clearly wrong with this company and its products, and their lack of enclosed instructions for use.Otherwise, once I learned how to change the blade from Eric P., I have to agree that the knife is worth at least three stars, on its own ergonomic merits. However, getting the knife open to retrieve a new blade is also not an intuitive process, although that one I figured out myself."
3,Heavy and uncomfortable,"I am a packer/shipper and use a box cutter/utility knife all day long. I have used the Stanley 10-499, the aluminum Craftsman version of the 10-499, and the recently the Stanley 10-788. The Craftsman is by far the best. I have been to Sears 4 times now looking for a replacement for my warn out one but without luck. The workers at Sears have no clue if the item has been discontinued or what. During an online search for new one I found the 10-788. The 10-788 does the job but at the same time is uncomfortable and very heavy. (I really liked the weight of the aluminum Craftsman since I have to carry the knife all day long.) This would be a good knife if I didn't have to use it as much and didn't have to carry it around. LOOK FOR THE CRAFTSMAN."
5,The best I ever had.,"I have owned a roofing business for the past 7 years. My biggest problem with cutters is that the blade pulls out when cutting thick shingles (You have to use a hook blade). This is the ONLY one I've had that the blade WILL NOT pull out. It will break first. I have 4 of them & they are all like that. Putting the blade in the cutter is tricky at first. That is what I think all of the other complaints were about. Once you figure that out, it's a snap."
1,ridiculously poor documentation on how to install blade,"Some engineer had a field day designing this. They forgot to tell the marketing and sales people that whoever buys it will need a class on how to install the blade for the first time. If you buy it, have someone show you how to install the blade to save yourself a ton of aggravation."
1,Horrible design,"Just received this knife. It jams very easily and the blade is hard to install. Opening the handle to get at the stored blades is cumbersome as well. Needless complexity. I have to get a band aid now, gotta go!"
2,The new Lenox Knife is better,I tried the Stanley knife and the Lenox knife. The blades in the Lenox knife cut better and do not break even in tough jobs. Buy the Lenox knife - you will love it.
1,"InstantChange? Conventional knife loads faster, and is safer.","If you're looking to check out the present day health system by way of your local emergency room, this is the knife for you. Completely unfathomable instructions, and dangerous loading procedure, once you go on line to get a clue as to how to load this thing.The only good thing about this product is the good ergonomics. Grossly overpriced for what is essentially a gadget. Should have been sold on a TV infomercial. (""But wait - there's more!"") Gimmicky crap."
2,Stupid instructions,"An idiot wrote the instructions for inserting blades. That's why this knife has so many negative reviews.In pictures, they show step #4 as pushing the slider with your index finger while simultaneously pushing the yellow button with your thumb and sliding the blade into to knife. This is incorrect because these are actually 2 separate steps and unless you've got the fingers of Superman, you won't be able to lock the slider in its open position with your index finger."
2,Blade slips out of locked position,"I like the retractable blade, but the notches that keep the blade in one of various positions are not adequate, and the blade keeps retracting.Also, the access to change the blade and storage of extra blades are NOT obvious and are difficult to figure out."
1,Back to the store!,"A piece of junk. Upon opening the package, reading the instructions and trying to attach the blade, I immediately realized I had a defective unit. I figured I'd look it up on the net and try to find out if I was doing something wrong - if a product is supposed to be simple to use, but you still have to go online and seek help on its basic functionality, you know it has design issues! After reading entries in a couple of sites and finally here, I decided I won't waste any more time trying to get it to work. It is going back to the store. The engineers designed a good looking tool, but they did not make a product that works."
1,Mystification of the obvious,"We, everyone of us, are currently enlightened. Each guru quoted herein does have a book to sell, a system to further, or their own ego to feed. What are their credentials? Well, YOU wouldn't understand so you need to take it on faith. Frankly, doubt is a better religion. If one is serious about enlightenment, and it okay to be serious about it, pursue it youself. Go to your library, or Inter Library Loan, and read anything by Ramana Maharshi, or Eckhart Tolle's The Power of Now, and avoid this bomb. Look into the Four Noble Truths of the Buddha, but avoid the Sutras & Suttas. Enlightenment is less not more, but it is all. You Will Be Amazed. HUTM is a sales pitch for the gurus contained within the book: create a need and then fill it. If you must read this, get it from the library -- there are better books to buy."
2,What she's pushing up the mountain is eastern mysticism,"It would've been more honest for the author to title the book in such a way as to let the reader know she's pushing eastern mysticism. After the first 60 pages of apparently endless debate attempting to answer the question what is enlightenment, I decided this will make a better library donation than an addition to my bookshelf."
2,halfway up the mountains write about halfway up the mountains,"This is an insightful book, well written, well documented and easy to understand.I only give it a 2star rating because, ironicly, some of the experts who are quoted, in fact the one who is quoted the most happen to be abusive, halfway up the mountain guru's themselves. With this the book's credability is undermined."
2,Erm..not quite as brilliant as the others say it is,"I found this a rather messy collection of quotes from various spiritual teachers, (many of whom have books promoted in the back pages of the book) rather than a continuous narrative. The 'quote' aspect of the book makes for an uncomfortable stop/go kind of a read. This uncomfortability however could well be my fault as opposed to the author's. However in truth there isn't much authoring going on here. This book is more like a collection of pieces by other folk. I read many spiritual texts for inspiration but didn't pick up much in this volume apart from a general feeling of negativity. A similar theme is tackled with much more (ahem) insight in Jack Kornfield's 'After the Buddha, the laundry' which is a terrific read and very inspiring."
4,A good addition,"The signal track is a good addition to your child's Thomas collection. It has levers to push, signs that move, and different sounds for stop and go. My son and his playmates have a hard time sharing this one!"
4,Trains & More,My daughter tells me that my grandson is really enjoying this expansion to his Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway set. What more could I ask for?
3,Great toy but mysteriously broken,"We got this for our son for Christmas a year ago. He loved it. He babied it. He was very nice to it. Mysteriously, a year later, even with a new battery, it has stopped working. It no longer makes noise of any kind and the signal lights work unpredictably. There appears to be no way to fix it. These Thomas toys are expensive and they should last longer than one year of light use."
5,Love Trains,Grandson loves Thomas and trains so this was a nice addition to his set.Sturdy and simple to use. Nice
5,Gift for nephew,"He loves thomas the train. this was an excellent gift, because he had the large track. Hopefully, he learned the meaning of stop, because he is a BUSY child"
2,Signal Light Stopped Working Within Two Weeks,"We bought this for my 3 year old son for Christmas, and he loved the gift. However, within two weeks one of the traffic lights stopped working and it's not easy to fix. So, although this seemed like a great toy at first, it's overpriced for what you get."
1,Drives my son nuts!,"Our little boy was also drawn to this toy at the bookstore. The problem is, the stop sign drops down when the light is green which makes our little guy crazy. He screams and cries because he wants a red light on when the stop sign is down and a green light when the stop sign is up. Makes sense to me. I am going to have to make this thing disappear after he falls asleep!"
1,More Waco Lies,These zealots with machine guns in one hand and a bible in the other killed ATF agents carring out the laws of our nation.I don't shed a tear for these religous gun nuts.
4,Even pacing with greater character depth than Left Behind,"Book Two of the Prodigal Project series has sold me on this story line. The action and story development are more subtle and sophisticated than the wildly popular Left Behind series, and the characters are much more interesting. Believability is also a big plus with Abraham's work--I can see this stuff happening! In contrast, Left Behind, which I did enjoy, almost feels like and End Times Christian James Bond plot.The confusion factor is resolved in Book Two. The author introduced us to an almost overwhelming array of characters in the first book, and it became easy to get them mixed up. In Exodus the various subplots become well defined, and the characters take on dimensions that draw us in. I liked many of these people, and felt the tension of their struggles and temptations.Bottom-line: A sophisticated and believable alternative to Left Behind--a definite buy recommendation."
4,Wibbly Pig Likes Bananas,"Wibbly Pig is absolutely adorable. Cute illustrations. Great book for little ones, especially in developing their independent tastes. They can be interactive as they get older in deciding what they like best when Wibbly Pig asks them what they like."
1,Attack of La Nina,Although convenient. The online video solution on my Sony XBR is of poor quality. I would not recmmend this solution for video delivery. I will not buy another. The original picture is about 10% of the screen and when magnified the video quality in unacceptable.
3,An interesting but depressing read,"I am only about half way done with this book so its probably a bad idea to post a review. My early impression is that its a good historical novel. However, that brings up the interesting paradox. Because the book is probably pretty accurate historical its actually a bit depressing. The 12th century was a rough period. I think its tough for a lot of people, especially those from middle class backgrounds, how violent the 12th century was. Reading this book was a bit of cultural shock. Values are just so different from our current age. For me, its hard to really like any of the characters. I appreciate that this is a good historical novel yet I only rated it three stars because I am not really enjoying this work as much as other works because its depressing to read about grown men who are constantly settling their arguments with each other by smashing their neighbors heads open."
2,"Accurate, But Dull","The author of this novel seems to be a dedicated historian, but not, unfortunately, a talented storyteller. The characters are so unsympathetic that I had a hard time caring what happened to them. They lead very dreary lives (yes, even the Crusades are dreary in this novel) and they seem almost completely unable to communicate with each other. It is almost unheard of for me to leave a book unfinished -- even if the book is bad, I usually feel compelled to find out what happens -- but I quit this 491 page book on page 227. I tried, I really did, but I was unable to maintain any interest in these characters."
5,Real Happy!!,"This is a high quality machine... Ran perfect right out of the box [be sure you do the break in procedure]...Mine is a updated verson with braded stainless steel hose connecting the tank to the compressor instead of copper tubing like it says in the product discription...The only problem I had was the wheel and axel vibrated in the mounts so I cut 2 short pieces hose and put them on both sides of the wheel, Now it's quiet...Hope this helps."
4,Jack Hunter: The quest for Akhenatens Tomb,I was very entertained by this and would very much like to have the other two to complete the triology. Please release them so I can buy them.
4,"Captain power,HOT!","I remember captain Power back in 1987,that was one of the most intriguant show there was that year.Captain Power and the soldiers of the future were:Captain Power(Jonathan Power),HAWK,TANK and the girl(Pilot)wich was also the captain's girl.Every kid was loving captain Power and the famous gunship who was like throwing a laser to to TV at the same time there were enemies to shoot on the video(it never worked with at the time for me,probably I just didn't get how it worked cause i was too young or something,but it seemed to work for others).Unfortunately,a bad marketing made so the toys didn't sell enough and it has cost the show.Only one season but a season it was,Everybody lovin that space stuff should check for Captain Power.That show has really good scrypt."
1,Sony big screen tv KDF-70XBR950 DO NOT LAST.,"I bayed $ 10,OOO.00 for this TV back in 2005 new. Had to replace lamp 5 times and in 2011 started showing blue dots on screen and buy now have about 50 dots and a BLUE BOTTON right corner on screen. THIS TV DID NOT LAST 7 YEARS."
1,Use O'Reilly instead!,"I bought this book after reading all the great reviews and was sadly disappointed. Granted, this is an exhaustive reference covering objects, properties, event handlers, methods and functions. However, the examples have absolutely no context to them at all. Further, I found inaccuracies about which objects are supported in which browsers (e.g. indicates that navigator.plugins is supported in IE and this is false). This means that this boos is useful purely as a reference, where you know EXACTLY what it is that you want to do, EXACTLY what method you are looking for to do something, that you need no illustrative application examples, and also that you are very experienced in browser compatibility issues. Personally, I feel the O'Reilly definitive guide is far better, both as a reference and as guide."
2,"Not too bad, if it were released in 94....but....","Hi there, I had a lot of hardcore JS todo, that broke browsers, and hella stuff like, crossbrowser dhtml etc. and needed a quick reference. I'd say if you're a hardcore commercial js/dhtml programmer this book is not for you. as a reference if you're starting out and need a quick what does this do type of thing i'd use yeah. but as a hardcore concise reference stay well away.part of this has to do with the way it was organised, with very little cross-referencing (which when doing cross browser is very important). more-over, <div> and handlers were very poorly documented, with netscvape <div> documentation almost non-existance.let's hope the second version proves to be more of a concise reference then this is."
3,Eh,"It was OK for looking up syntax for client side DHTML, but I was disappointed with the Netscape focus. My coporate intranet was exclusively with IE clients and IIS servers. I would have liked to have seen an additional chapter on IIS and IE object model."
4,Excellent book!,"This is the most comprehensive book on Javascript available. It is a complete listing of (I assume) all of the Javascript language with full details of support for various platforms. The only wish on my wish list is that it could have been organized a bit differently. I would like to see it organized according to what is supported on both IE and Netscape, then what is supported on IE, then what is supported on Netscape, then alphabetically. Isolating the reference this way would greatly help those of us who must sit on the NC/IE fence all the time. Otherwise, I don't think you'll find a better book around."
2,"Huge, but poorly written and contains many errors","I haven't read any other books on Javascript, but I hope there is some better coverage out there. I find Pure Javascript to be informative, but handicapped by poor writing, contrived examples and errors.There are technical errors in both of the first two examples of the book. Typical of the quality of a SAMS book."
3,nice dead-tree compilation,"This book is a good reference for those with a decent know-how of Java, Cobol, C, or C++. The best thing about the tome is that it has a neat dictionary styled reference of methods, objects, properties, and not-real-world-enough example code bits. Those who want advanced stuff should refer the CookBook or the Visual QuickStart guides, and of couse beginners are better off with the Thau book or some such."
3,"Decent camp, but I expected more","STACY is chock-full-of EVIL DEAD references and other in-jokes, and features some wild gore scenes (although comicly done), but after years of waiting to see this I was expecting a bit more. Zombie completists will still want this for their collection. Fun, but a bit too corny for my taste."
1,Shot on tape,"What a weird film.Lots of gore. It reminded me of Re-animator at times, Japanese style. Maybe if it was made on a more serious note rather than such a campy style, it might make a good movie.The fact that it was shot on tape didn't help it one bit either. I hate that.And the theme... something must have definitely been lost in translation because I did not understand the point of this movie at all.You take your chances on this one. I can't recommended it but neither can I trash it. Zombies. Japanese schoolgirls. Lots of blood and gore. Did I mention shot on tape?"
1,I'd give it Zero stars if possible,"I am an avid horror movie fan. I also love dark comedies and this was by far the worst movie i have ever seen. Each copy of this movie should be burned in a fire before it's mindnumbing LACK of plot, acting talent, and gore spread to more movie fans. In theory the story itself sounds extremely promising, however this is a movie that i could not turn away from while watching because i just kept assuming, ""it has to get better at some point right?"". Wrong. The acting is absolutely horrendous. The gore is really not nearly as gorey as others on here would lead you to believe. And the general underlying premise of love in the story is far too care bear and cotton candy campy for any actual person to believe. If you have any theatre background or appreciation of fine arts at all, watching this movie all the way through will only prove that you have masocistic tendencies towards your own intelligence. Save yourselves."
1,DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!,"I rented this crap thinking it was going to be semi-good, but it's not. The filming looks like it was done with a 100 dollar camcorder. Acting, and special efx really poor. Better off renting original zombie movies such as night, day, and dawn of the dead. I rent alot of b-flick horror movies, so i know whats good or not. This movie sux with a capital ""S""."
4,In all honesty...,"This film is a guilty pleasure if there ever was one. It ranks right up there with ABBA Gold in terms of guilty pleasures. While not the best movie ever made it does have some strong points. Frankly it could have been an honestly moving and heart-wrenching film had it not been so badly acted and silly. From what I understand the movie ""Stacy"" has nothing to do with the book on which it is based except that girls are dying and returning from the dead to consume human flesh. Go ahead and lay down some bucks for this film and try to be open minded while watching it. Hey, its better than that crap from French film maker Jean Rollin."
3,what the ?,"Interesting, shot-on-video low budget horror from Japan that works quite well in some places but is just plain silly in others.If you're looking for gross out effects that are completely over the top then look no further.Some of the imagery is quite haunting actually."
1,T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E,"I don't know what was going through my head when I paid forty dollars for this at HMV. Reviews I read made it seem somewhat okay, but no, no it's just terrible. From the moment I pressed play I was dissapointed. The Camera quality was awful, acting awful, gore effects...incredibly awful. Seriously, this looked like it was done by a bunch of film students who don't have any knowledge of effective film making, and think that if they use American icons they can win people over, hence the ""Bruce Campbell's right arm 2"" chainsaw they advertise in the film. This is probably the worst thing I've ever bought, luckily I talked my way into trading it for The Fresh Prince season one, which is one laugh after another, oh what a crazy mismatch! But just dont ever make the mistake of thinking it might be good. dont buy it, rent it, or even talk about it. Thank you."
3,Could have been fun!,"I wish I had read befor I orderd this movie, ""English Sbutitles"" movie was in Japanaes with English Subtitles""!!!!"
3,Costs too much for what you get,"I liked the case to a point. Its made of plastic and doesn't last very long, plus the price is really too high for what it is made of ."
5,Traditional Stencil Designs,"""Brilliant in the designing a some Quilts, many more ideas and projects in the making, wife is keeping me broke."""
1,Not helpful at all,I ordered this in conjuction with metal engraving tools with the idea that the designs could be transfered to metal for engraving. I was very disappointed to find it to be merely a historical catalog of stencils that have no practical use for my purposes.
3,Historical and not useful,"If you are a craftperson, do not buy this book, though pictoral, it is more historical and you need a magnifying glass to see some of the stencils."
1,deceiving,"Looks like it's actually an order catalog. The pictures are so small, detail is lost and would be hard to copy. They are not stencils, but pictures of henna designs."
5,Has been a great resource for me,"This is a wonderful (and very large) collection of ornate stencil designs which I've used mostly in desktop publishing. It really is an amazing resource, but to get the full use out of these designs you'll need to scan them. If you want to resize the images after they've been scanned without getting jagged edges it's best to trace them and turn them from bitmaps into vectors (freeware vector software such as Inkscape is ideal for this)."
2,a little disappointing...,"This dvd is simply 2 TS episodes where the homeowners hated the results. It has ""bonus"" footage, but it's the same stuff from the first TS dvd ""The Best of Trading Spaces"".Not worth the money."
1,I HATED IT!!!!....,"This is NOTHING but 2 shows where the people didn't like the results. No outtakes or things that couldn't be shown on regular tv. If your a regular viewer of the show you have seen everything on this dvd. The ""bonus"" footage is again nothing you haven't seen before, just reactions that where shown during the orginal airings of those shows. Surely with the radcial reactions to some of their makeovers there have been some reactions deemed not suitable for regular tv but if there where none are shown here. ... Doesn't deserve 1 star but couldn't rate it lower!"
1,Not Worth It,"I LOVE the show Trading Spaces. Ever since Paige Davis took over the show there is not a single episode that I haven't seen. When the Trading Spaces They Hated It aired on TV I was extremely dissapointed. I thought it would be really great and that they would show much more of the reactions of the homeowners hating it but they didnt. It is a total waste of your money if you have seen these episodes before. It is 2 episodes, each for 55 minutes they RE-BROADCAST the episode and then for the last 5 minutes give you a bonus addition where they tell you whether or not they homeowners kept it or not and what it looks like now. NO EXAGERATION this is exactly the way it is. As a HUGE fan of the show I can't believe I am saying this... Dont waste your money."
1,"More like ""They had a tepid reaction!""","Thank goodness we checked this out from the library. We'd never seen Trading Spaces, but I was curious to see what all the fuss was about. Surely the extremely negative reactions that the cover blurb seemed to promise would provide us with the best encapsulation of the appeal of this show, right? WRONG. Nobody bursts into tears, nobody retches and runs from the room with their hand over their mouth, nobody threatens to firebomb their neighbors' homes in retaliation, nobody clenches their fists, throws back their head and bellows ""WHYYYYYYYYY?!?"" to an aloof and uncaring deity. In fact, pretty much every reaction is along the lines of, ""Oh. Well. Maybe I'll get used to it..."" If you love the idea of watching someone else's boring tract home being redecorated in order to view the homeowners' stoic, listless demeanors upon viewing the finished product, by all means, proceed. All others, steer clear of this dud."
2,not enough train wrecks,"One of my favorite things about the early Trading Spaces, is how the expert designers would completely ignore the requests of the decoratees. (Please keep the carpet, it is only a year old. The decorator, ""The carpet must go."") I hoped to see more of those in clips, like a highlights reel. This was not the case. This is just two episodes, although the second one when the woman is crying off camera after she just needs to be alone for a minute in the reveal made this CD worthwhile. I don't mean to sound uncharitable, but in the great scheme of life, bad interiordecoration is not a tragedy of overwhelming proportions, and it is part of the risk that makes the program enjoyable. If you are a huge Trading Spaces fan, purchase this, otherwise let it pass."
1,Not worth the money.,Only two episodes on the disc. Quality looks like it was recorded on a flip phone. Don't waste your money.
2,Rather Disappointed,"The DVD only had two shows and the ""Bonus material"" was only some clips of other people that hated their rooms. I was hoping for interviews, details, etc. not just clips of other shows."
2,"Ha,Ha on YOU, Jessica Wakefield! (**1/2)","When Jessica finally gets Wealthy, Handsome Bruce Patman, she becomes his Love Slave, running his errands and attending to his personal matters, something she's NEVER been for a boy. Twin Sister Elizabeth can't stand to see her in this state, and tries to talk her out of the relationship, but Jessica is Convinced Bruce loves her. When she finally sees what a jerk he really is when she catches him with another girl, she humiliates him, leaving him a mess. The thing is though, Jessica really got what she Deserved. Shes been doing the same things to guys all her life! Now SHE knows how it feels! Of Course that doesnt Stop Her from ordering Robin Wilson around in the Next Book..."
2,Love blind...,"Jessica Wakefield has always been fascinated with Bruce Patman, from his dark, good looks, to his luxurious mansion and millions of dollars. She is ecstatic when she finally gets the chance to date Bruce. Should she follow her heart or should she be aware of what her family and friends' warnings about him?This is a particularly annoying story, since the reader sees Jessica's spirit and confidence become trampled as she struggles to please the egotistical Bruce. Then again, she is also vain and self-centered, so maybe they are meant for each other.."
1,Kate William does it again...and that isnt good,"Boring again,Kate!Jessica is going out with the ultimate jerk---BRUCE!"
5,Inspring and Uplifting,"I love it! If I am not mistaken she is the only former American Idol contestant that has used her amazing talent to spread the love of God. God Bless Mandisa, and may the Lord continue to use her to spread the love of God through her beautiful voice and amazing talent!"
5,Absolutely Fabulous!!,"This CD is a blessing. I've already bought a few to share with others as a ministry tool. I love every track. There is no way I can choose a favorite. Of all the CDs I own, this is by far the best. When you feel like praising the Lord, like dancing, like crying... when you are in need of encouragement... there's a track for you. It's complete. Her voice will amaze you and the words will refresh you. A must have!"
3,Good start,"Mandisa has a awesome voice with the right songs theses were the best of them all 1- God Speaking,Voice Of A Savior, Unrestrained & He Will Come.The rest of the cd was just so so. Looking forward to seeing her next cd a christian one. Id wait til they come out with a ep cd with just theses songs."
3,R & B should CRY,"Love God's Speaking--but I so loved Mandisa at the beginning on AI. Oh Mandisa--How I long to hear those songs you did on AI--I Won't Hurt Anymore, Never, Cry, I'm Every Woman, Don't You Worry About a Thing, TOUR: Duet with ACE (I'm Your Angel) and If I Were Your Woman. Come Back to R & B, MANDISA.But, I wish you all the best because YOU like ELLIOTT YAMIN can sing anything. or is that ""anythang""OK after listening to GOD is SPeaking --changed rating to 4 Stars-but still would prefer R & B for her. WHY NOT BOTH"
5,"Saw Her Sing, Live!","After seeing & hearing her at the Women of Faith conference in August 2009, I had to get this CD. I've also bought copies for relatives and friends. Her music is inspirational and fun to sing along with. I recommend the ""Freedom"" CD as well. I'm happy that God led her away from ""AI"" to pursue her calling."
5,Excellent Cd,"This cd is Excellent! Mandisa has a great voice and every song is amazing. My favorite songs are: Only the world, God speaking, Voice of a savior, Shackles(Praise you), Oh, My Lord, and He Will Come. If you Loved Mandisa on American Idol then you will love this cd!!"
4,Good package. One lens worth the full price,"Overall this is a fair package. The case was a bit smaller than I'd hoped and the 28-80mm isn't quite the quality of the 18-70mm that came with my A200. The 100-300mm, however, was worth the price of the package alone. Works great by itself in auto-focus mode. I also tried it out with a 2X teleconverter. The 2X that I have will not use the auto-focus on lenses >f4, so I was forced to use the manual focus, which is not a big deal. Great photos, but the manual focus is a bit sensitive. It took some practice to get the focus just right. Overall, I'd suggest this package to any serious hobbiest"
1,Not so good,"I have one of these jig saws.Cheap China crap.The clamp that holds the blade(U style)in,clamps it at an angle,not straight.It has a tendency to pull and cut to the left.Not so good for cutting any long cuts.Don't waste the money."
5,Another Great Book!,"Well, Francine Pascal has done it again! Another great fearless!! where will these books stop?"
5,GREAT FOR A WON MAN SHOP,"I PURCHASED THIS COMPRESSOR ABOUT TO WEEKS AGO AND HAVE USED IT A LOT IN MY ONE MAN WOODWORKING, IT WORKS MY AIR TOOLS LIKE A DREAM.

1,porter cable shop boss,"i purchased the compressor after reading other reviews that claimed this compressor would pretty much keep up with air tools. WRONG! i would not reccommend this compressor to anyone desiring to run tools requiring 90 psi, as it doesn't come close to keeping up. need to inflate a ball or tire? this compressor can handle that.Porter-Cable CPFC2TV3525VP 15 Amp 3.5 Horsepower 25-Gallon Oil-Free Wheeled Vertical Compressor"
1,partially hydrogenated soybean oil - a transfat by any other name...,"After making such a big deal about being allergen-aware, you would think they would have gotten the trans-fats out of this product, too. No such luck. Leave this one off your shopping list."
1,Worthless,"I bought 4 of these plus 2 of the ones for the TV. Waste of money they are, especially if you have a TV that curves, where they can get their fingers in the sides. For the vcr, my 2 year old son just pulls the top and reach in. If anything it's a pinching hazard. Toys r Us use to carry a VCR guard that fit into the opening of the vcr. I used that one when my daughter was younger, she's now 4, and even now they can't open that kind because it requires sliding a button while holding an alternate side, something she can't do even at 4 going on 5. That one is made by Safety 1st and you can find it on the internet. Don't waste your money on this!!!"
3,Be sure to measure before buying,"This looks like a great little product, but it just didn't fit my VCR/DVD player combo.Be sure to measure your VCR and you should be fine.That was my bad."
2,Great for YOUNG toddlers.,"This product worked great until my 20 month-old daughter became strong enough to rip it off. Watching us take it off (because we had one button on there that didn't work on the remote) made her curious and one week after installing it, she figured it out. Now she takes it off at least once a day. (Just wish she could figure out how to put it back on)"
3,It works!,"A bit expensive for the final product. When I first took it out of the box, I thought, ""Wow, this is cheap piece of plastic."" However, it really works! At least the boys keep their hands off the buttons of the TV now and I am not saying no every five seconds..."
2,The Heart of Coaching: Using Transformational Coaching to Create a High-Performance Coaching Culture (3rd Edition),"This book does have some good background information about coaching. It is pretty dry though. If you want to learn about coaching, take an accredited coaching certification program. I did, and this was one of our required reads. It happened to be my least favorite and gave me very little practical information to use during a coaching session. If you want to read an inspiring, empowering book, read Breaking the Rules by Kurt Wright."
5,The best book on coaching to date,"The Heart of Coaching is by far the best book on the subject of coaching I have read to date. As a management consultant, I have learned that the most difficult challenge in coaching is blending the ""heart"" of coaching with measurable results. Tom Crane has skillfully blended the ""soft"" coaching skills that are neccesary for coaches to inspire and motivate with the ""hard"" skills of measurably improved performance. It is the latter which is essential for continuing organizational support of any coaching program. Without results, coaching will not be effective. I have been recommending this book to managers around the world because it achieves that delicate balance between organizational culture and individual performance. It is also filled with fun, inspirational quotes, and is easy to read without being too basic. Another ""must read""."
5,"Practical, Relevant & Insightful","Of the myriad of books I've read on coaching and creating a high performance culture, The Heart of Coaching is by far the undisputed winner! Filled with foundational principles and practices, this book gave me all the tools I needed to feel confident and equipped in my coaching assignments. I was able to take what I learned in this book and apply it in the workplace immediately. As coaching continues to grow, I think Thomas G. Crane's book will come to standout as a definitive work."
4,Heart of Coaching,"As a new instructional coach in an educational setting, this book provided great discussion in a book study."
5,Another veterinarian goes holistic !,"What a fun and informative book. Dr. Shoen has a great story telling capacity that comes through in his written word. You will laugh, perhaps cry but you will enjoy this book whether you are an animal lover, critter caregiver or not."
4,Slim & Sexy forever,"I like all of Suzanne Somers books. She has great recipes (although they tend to be expensive) and great advice. I lost a lot of weight on her eating plans. Customer beware of her tendency to preach bioidentical hormone therapy. No one knows the long-term use of these products and as a consumer I would not buy them. Instead I would buy Jillian Michaels' new book about metabolism and read how to balance the system naturally. Otherwise, Suzanne has a great book."
4,Suzanne Somers' Slim and Sexy Forever,You have got to give Suzanne credit people ~ she is prolific in her conveyance of cutting edge health issues and how to deal with them. This girl is a veritable fount of information. I may not agree with ALL of it since I have tried hormone replacement of one sort or another and have found some of it to be effective. BUT THIS GIRL CAN MARKET!! And she appears to be almost fearless in her application of recently discovered methodologies of self healing. Bravo for another successful marketing effort.
3,its ok,"My doctor recommended that I read this book as an introduction to bio-identical replacement hormones. There really is little information that I found useful in this one. There are some recipes, but I haven't really reviewed or tried any of them. Perhaps if someone doesn't have any background in the endocrine system (mine is limited) and is too lazy to do one's own research, this book might be helpful. I have developed some breathing issues that may be hormone related, but otherwise I am a very healthy, normal weight, post-menopausal woman and I really don't care if I am slim and sexy at 57."
3,Book was OK,"I learned a few things about my body that I didn't know, which lead me to order some other products after further investigation."
4,Slim & Sexy forever,"It was a good book for someone who can take hormones. After breast cancer you can't take hormones, so basically, the book didn't help me at all."
5,great book -,A terrific book. Will reread many times as a lot of learning to do. Many advanced theories.Shirley
3,Complicated,"I admire Suzanne Somers for trying to reach people about how hormones affect weight, but this book was complicated to apply to my everyday life. The Suzanne Somers biography and The Sexy Years were much better than this book. Now that Suzanne Somers has opened my eyes, I will continue to look for a book that can explain how hormones and food affect health and weight that is simpler to apply."
2,I don't like it,"I really don't, even the recipes which are the reason why I've bought her books after giving up her diet plan because it wasn't working aren't delicious like in her other books."
3,Suzanne Somers' slim and sexy forever,"The book is ok, she does a fairly good job discussing hormone replacement therapy especially related to bioidentical hormones. I found her recipes to be a bit on the unrealistic side for the average woman, since most women cannot afford the ingredients in those recipes. She needs to remember who her audience is.I have not finished reading the book, but I found it surprising that she would be taking any type of estrogen with her breast cancer history."
2,THIS BOOK WAS A BOMB!,I didn't think very much of this book. I really thought it was a bomb and a big waste of my money.
2,Fun electronic/techno,Not bad for listening to while doing work that requires some focus. It stayed in my car CD player for a month or so.
5,moving drama,"This is a wonderful example of a real-life story put to film. All the actors do a very good job with their roles. Luckily the writers, director, etc. avoided the pitfall of attempting to modernize the people or story to make it more 'relateable'. I highly recomend it."
4,Great Movie,"In 1880, on 11 of November, NED KELLY was hanged at Melbourne jail. 126 years ago!!! So I decided to watch the movie once again. This one is one of my favourites."
3,Just okay,"Simply just liked this film and felt it dragged a bit. The Australian countryside is gorgeous. I enjoyed the thirteen minute bonus, Ned Kelly and Popular Culture, more than the film. The bonus is closed captioned."
3,ned kelly,"I was very disapointed that I could NOT play this on my DVD or Blue Ray players. I could play it on my computer, which was not intended for. The movie itself was good and entertaining.Mike D."
4,Surprisingly better than I thought. . .,"Yes, everyone likes Heath Ledger and it's sad that he's gone - but he has left some excellent work out there. This is one of his better films. I'm glad I bought it, it's good enough to watch twice."
4,Irish Pride,"I really enjoyed this movie on the whole. There are parts where it is a little slow, but overall it is a great movie about the underdog. Ned Kelly and his outlaws stood up to the British and the coppers who declared war on them and their families. They had no idea what was about to hit them, as they soon learned, Irish people stick up for their own blood. Heath Ledger was great in this movie as Ned Kelly, a strong leader with a sense of right and wrong. I only give it 4 stars because it was a little slow in parts. I don't really know the exact history and if all the facts were here, but as a movie this is a good one. Along the same lines as The Patriot and Michael Collins. Worth watching especially if you are Irish."
5,excellent,This is a very good film that tells the story of the legendary outlaw Ned Kelly. Most of the negative comments on here are by folks who pick on aspects of the film that are in reality fine and accurate. Those who know the story of Ned Kelly and expect a realistic film and not a CGI action flick will appreciate it the most.
3,Ned Kelly,"I admire this man, Heath Ledger, as a person and an actor. I believe he was one of the most important actors of his day, and was deeply saddened by his death. This ""Ned Kelly"" did not adequately suit the actor and was not a movie I really liked."
5,"""I Loved This Film""","I love anything Heath Ledger performs in so I was impressed to find this movie starring a handful of other Hollywood stars including Orlando Bloom, Geoffry Rush, and Naomi Watts. ""Ned Kelly"" is an Australian film and centers on the story of Kelly, a legendary bushranger, who forms a gang in fighting off the bad guys in 19th century Australia.The movie only made a paltry $6,000,000 at the box office and most critics panned the film stating that although Heath was wonderful in the lead role the supporting cast was underused.Bonuses include the featurettes ""Ned Kelly in Popular Culture"" and ""The Real Kelly Gang""."
4,A FINE FILM,"This is a film well worth watching. Heath Ledger is impressive and entirely believable as Ned Kelly. Other performances are commendable, particularly Orlando Bloom. That said, Ledger's depiction of the title character and the impression he makes in his interpretation serves to add to an all-too brief but considerable legacy in film."
4,Quick ship - Perfect Condition,"This dvd was in my player in less than a week of ordering it. Really a pretty good movie. I have read the history of Ned Kelly, and the movie stayed close to the reality. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is so many details were left out. The movie could have run for 20 more minutes easily, and given more facts to make everything tie together a bit better. Other than that, great flick, great acting and directing."
5,Great movie,"As an Aussie, I grew up learning about Ned Kelly along with all the other Bushrangers but with my kids growing up overseas, I am always looking for ways to keep them in touch with their Aussie roots. This is, unfortunately, not a movie for young kids so mine haven't seen it yet but it will remain in my collection for when they ARE old enough. In the meantime, my husband and I enjoyed watching it. I liked learning more about this colorful character from our rich history and my husband really enjoyed the movie too."
3,As usual......,"Heath Ledger gives a performance that is so real, so genuine and so meaningful, that you actually think you are watching the real Ned Kelly, even if you knew nothing about him before seeing this movie. Another reminder of losing one of the most incredible actors of this lifetime, all too soon. The film itself is interesting, and almost unimagineable at times. At times, the story is told in somewhat general terms, and so some of the detail missing makes you have to think about what would have happened or could have happened to these young men. I would recommend seeing it for the interesting, sad, heartwarming and unfortunate life story of Ned Kelly, but more than that, if you are a fan of Heath Ledgers, will not be disappointed."
5,"A Sad Attempt To ""Rewrite Australian History""","In this sorry excuse for a movie Heath Ledger plays the Australian Outlaw Ned Kelly. Americans make heroes out of their old Lawmen but for some unknown reason Australians romanticize and glorify the ""bad boys' of their past. This movie is in NO WAY An accurate Historical depiction of the life of Ned Kelly. In this movie Ned has the obligatory sexual encounter with a woman although most Historians wil agree that sadly Ned most probably died a virgin.Poor guy. The movie also fails to depict the true event where Ned shot a Trooper (Law Officer) in the groin.Ned has become a Hero from Australian Working Class. I guess this is to be expected when your country was founded by convicts and women of loose moral character. This movie was shot in the one horse country town of Clunes which I hope I never get to visit. I give this movie 5 stars because once again the filmakers have tried to turn Fantasy into a Reality onscreen."
3,No second chances for Ned in this down under Western...,"No first, really.Story in a nutshell: Ned Kelly is falsely accused of taking a horse and sent to prison. When he gets out, the cops won't leave him or his family alone.This show's pretty brutal about 18th century justice in the Outback. Overall, very good action flick. I could have done without the romance and I question the historical accuracy. Still, taken at face value, the film is great entertainment. Ledger and Bloom are great eye candy."
1,dummy mat does not include dummy box!,"The picture depicts the electrical box as part of the item. Not true. All you receive, essentially, is a plastic mat with hole punchouts to inset the electrical box you most likely have if you bought the ScatMat. It is not worth it. I love the scat mat, but they should include a dummy box too."
2,Should Include Dummy Power Box,When you look at the photos you believe it appears just like a scat-mat but dont believe it as it is just a mat without the power box which it should include a dummy one too. The mat has holes for a box but one was not shipped with it so basically you are paying for a plastic mat. Have not tried it yet so I will let you know if it works without the box.
4,Great ideas,"What a great way to get inspired to make changes, showing you how to get started, how to think differently about where you live and what you can afford. Also, if you're open minded you learn about what makes a room something to LIVE in instead of just exist in. It's interesting to see the people too, the ones who get it, what they can learn from it, whether they like the colors or fabrics (which can be changed easily) and the ones who don't and complain about great changes, obviously because they'd rather live in chaos for the rest of their lives."
1,Not Worth the Money,This dvd was okay but way too short and not worth the money. I have ordered the entire season of Project Runway for the same amount of money and it included 3-4 dvd's. Don't waste your money on this one.
4,cool music,"The whole CD is instrumental, but it is more in depth than other instrumental CD's I've heard. They balance it out really well."
4,Inexpensive waffle iron works well,"I purchased this waffle iron recently at Target for less than $$$$. I was willing to buy a more expensive unit, but reviews of the expensive units weren't that great, so I decided to give a budget-priced unit with high wattage a try. I've been very surprised with how well it works. The 1200 watt unit heats up within a few minutes (a green light turns on to indicate when it's ready). I give the grids a very light spray of Pam before filling with batter each time and never have any sticking. Each waffle takes 5 minutes to bake and they come out crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. It doesn't have an indicator to tell you when the waffle is done, but I just set my timer for 5 minutes, no problem. Between waffles, it heats up instantly, no waiting to pour another waffle in. I downgraded it slightly because the design makes the waffles flatter (not as tall) as they are in restaurants. The unit is very sleek and pretty as well."
1,Product was chipped out of the box.,"I ordered this as a gift and when it was opened, the reaction was not happiness but shock. The item was chipped on the lid. So then I ordered a replacement and when that was received, it was chipped in the same spot and the handle was loose. I do not recommend this product as it does not seem to ship very well."
2,Hard to clean,"We received this waffle maker as a gift. The waffles come out a little on the brown side, I like them a nice golden color. But it is very difficult to clean. We don't use it very much for that reason. If I had purchased this myself, I would return it."
2,Heats unevenly,The waffles are not a good as the ones from the commercial waffle maker found at Sunday buffets. The bottom of the pockets would be crisp and the tops a little soggy. It does heat up quickly. We later purchased the Villaware waffle maker and are happier with it.
2,JUNK!,"Bought it in May, it died yesterday (end of September). USB plugs never fully plugged into it well; they don't fit squarely and fall out easily. Some ports never fully worked. Cute appearance but just doesn't work right."
2,Disappointing,"I found this inferior to Machine Girl, Tokyo Gore police, and Vampire Girl. The budget is obviously much smaller than those three and there is almost no story to speak of. It basically a sequence of five fight scenes. For hardcore fans of this genre only."
3,Insights on music are worth the price of the book,Where John Frame's book proves especially helpful is in the area of music within Christian worship. Certain churches have found themselves in literal battlegrounds over music styles. Frame reminds his readers that when the focus moves away from the center-God-and focuses on something that is not-musical styles-then the church has lost something vital. Frame's insights on the use of music in worship makes this a worthwhile read.
5,GREAT STUFF,Really nice condition and really an interesting read. I really enjoyed getting this book and it has been quite an aid in my studies on worship of all generas.
1,I am more than a little perturbed,"I understand this is a work from a Sociology Professor, however I am afraid that I can not condone any such work being in a middle school library.I have spent a great deal of time trying to teach my children to respect all people regardless of their race and creed.I feel this book is very demoralizing to any race and women of all. I feel this book has no place in middle schools or any school for that matter."
2,Pleasant but Not that Interesting a Person,"Block is certainly a versatile and prolific writer. This new book relies strongly (90%+) on dialogue between a man and a woman in which much of the man's ""contributions"" to their conversations seem to come from being quite distracted, he's always asking ""what"", ""huh"" or making off the wall and ludicrous assumptions. She patiently puts up with his conversational lack of focus. He's certainly not very sympathetic in that he is an assassin for hire. He's clever but I can't imagine any situation (regardless of what I thought he did for a living) in which I'd want to spend time with him. There are other fictional assassins who are much more interesting as individuals. The premise of the story about competition in the assassin business certainly can't be taken very seriously. I wanted the book to be over by the half way point. This one is below the midway mark in Block's long list of books."
2,A waste of time and talent,"I really enjoyed Hit Man, but found this novel to be a major disappointment--certainly a waste of time and money. One gets the impression that the entire book was written over a long weekend. To say that it is padded is putting it mildly. If the air was squeezed out, you might have a nice short story. I was reminded of some of those Ed McBain 87th Precinct novels with mindless jokes, repetitious banter and thin plots. Block can do--and has done--much better work."
1,A waste of life,"I picked up this book because I had read a favorable review in the Washington Post. I was terribly disappointed. I kept reading this book on the hopes it would get better, and by the time I realized it wouldn't, I figured I might as well finish it. A book of this sort should be entertaining, humourous, and/or educational, especially when you have a lead charachter who is a hitman. This book had no redeeming value or entertainment value. Instead, there were countless conversations and internal monolugue that went nowhere and were often repetitive. The ""padding"" in this book was incredible. If this subject interests you, rent The Professional and Prizzi's Honor, both of which you can watch in less time than reading this waste of time for half the price."
2,Hit List Gets Whacked,"I've long been a devoted fan of Block, specifically the Matt Scudder series, but I latched onto Hit Man in '98. A great new character coupled with Block's talent at dialogue. Hit List, however, is filled with so many inane asides and trivial banter that the story suffers. I couldn't help thinking that this book couild have been told in half as many pages had the reader been spared some of the sparring between Keller and Dot--Patrick Picciarelli, author, ""Blood Shot Eyes."""
3,Too Much Schtick,"I looked forward to reading this book after I read ""Hit Man."" At best, it was average, with too many Abbott and Costello routines mixed in. What made the first book good was that it was a collection of short stories, which were, in effect, his assignments. Too bad this book couldn't have been more of the same. Also, not that I'm an expert, but his obsession with stamp collecting could lead to his downfall...he's leaving a trail. But maybe he wants to get caught...hmmmm. Read it and you'll see what I mean. I do recommend reading it, but don't have high expectations going in."
5,Surprised that this book has so many negative reviews,"I really enjoy this series. In the fiction market it's rare to find even 1 book that dares to step outside the usually well-defined boundaries of 'the usual' and when you do find such a rarity, it almost always misses its mark. The Keller mysteries not only step outside the usual boundaries and hits the mark but it does so with aplomb. They are a delicious telling of what it would probably be like from the hitman's point of view. Added to this is the fact that Keller simply isn't that bad of a guy. He just has an unusual job that he happens to be very good at."
1,DREADFULL!,"This is what happens when a succesfull author of many, many books has to write another one. Simply Dreadfull! There is hardly any story and 9/10ths of the book is filler!"
1,What a snore!,"This is the slo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-w-w-w-w-est novel I've ever read, and that includesall of Dickens and Hardy. At least Dickens writes interesting dialogue. The so-called""banter"" here is as pointless and tiresome as dialogue gets, constantly distracting usfrom the plot, which is pretty thin anyway. So if you like your ""thrillers"" sans suspense,go ahead and pick this up; it might be good to keep by your bedside for those nights whenyou can't sleep. This will put you to sleep, believe me."
2,A good idea wasted,"When I bought the book I was intrigued by the idea of a hit man being himself the prey. But what a disappointment it was - a very slowly moving plot (apart from the last 30/40 pages), pages of pointless ranting by the main characters, and then all this astrology nonsense ... I had a hard time to fnish it. The end itself is better, but it can't make up for the rest of the book."
1,"""Snooze"" List","Very disappointing. I thought it was going to be a book full of action and suspense, but it turns out to be a book full of constant worthless prattle by the two main characters. I wanted to scream, ""Where is this babble going? Shut up and get to the story!"" The action scenes are skipped over, and yet we are treated to about 4 1/2 chapters of jury duty."
2,The only Lawrence Block to bore me.,"Hit List could have been told in a short story. Way to much ponderous, inane conversations that took forever to get to the point.What plot there was was great but it took to long to get to it and spent to little time exploring it.I like Keller & Dot but this book did nothing for either of them."
1,I wish I was on the hit list,Brutally slow in developing. I gave it 75 pages and I had to stop wasting my time. Keller is BORING! What a lame central character. Give me a reason that I want to care about this guy. This is the first book I picked up from Block ... and my last. Bye bye beret boy.
1,Stamp collecting,If I wanted to read a book about stamp collecting I would have bought a book about stamp collecting. When I buy a book about a hitman I want to read a book about a hitman.
2,"Not as bad as ""Small Town,"" but....","This guy REALLY needs an editor. (Yeah, I know Block is a grandmaster and all that, but he hasn't written a good book in a long time). As several people here have pointed out, the tedious conversations between Keller and Dot in this one - with all her really lame jokes - seem to go on forever. To be honest, the whole book could have been 50 pages or so. I keep reading Block looking for the guy who wrote ""Eight Million Ways to Die"" and ""A Stab in the Dark"" and all that other great stuff. What happened to him?"
1,Total waste of time,"Avoid it,do not buy it, take a long walk, even talk to your ex(if you re divorced or seperated) you might find it less painfull.A total joke and waste of time and money.I wish i could ask for a refund and then burn the money infront of Mr Block.The story has no beginning and no end,everything that takes place is highly unlikely to happen.Keller and Dot the protagonists, do not have a bone of real life professionalism and to top it all,the hitman that suppossingly is after Keller, looks like an amauter at the end.Give us a break Block,even in B movies with no budget at all, directors try harder to make them believable.People, you want crime noir read Richard Stark and the Parker series.You want funny crime noir read Richard Stark and the Grofield series.Still whatever you do,do not read Block's Keller series,its a total waste of time."
1,What a snore!,"This is the slo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-w-w-w-w-est novel I've ever read, and that includes all of Dickens and Hardy. At least Dickens writes interesting dialogue. The so-called""banter"" here between the principal characters is as pointless and tiresome as dialogue gets, constantly distracting us from the plot, which is pretty thin anyway. So if you like your ""thrillers"" sans suspense,go ahead and pick this up; it might be good to keep by your bedside for those nights when you can't sleep. This will put you to sleep, believe me."
5,put it on your hit list ...,"lawrence block is one of my favorite writers; the way he blends together worlds and personalities and can create very memorable characters (such as Rodenbarr, Scudder, or Tanner - and now Keller).the dot/keller relationship is intriguing to say the least and ppl criticize it for being long and drawn out, but so does the rodenbarr/carolyn relationship - it seems this is the only kind block knows and he's good at it, so why change all of a sudden?this book has a very familiar feel to it - not in terms of storyline, but in terms of atmosphere. i would say that its atmosphere best resembles the rodenbarr mysteries.simply said if you like lawrence block's rodenbarr mysteries, then you'll like his keller series."
1,Perfect if you need to get some sleep!,"I was lucky enough to read through this in December, just in time to make ""Hit List"" my years worst read for 2000. This story lacks any interesting characters including Keller the featured hit man and the unmysterious Dot, his agent. There are numerous episodes of verbal dueling between Keller and Dot over the most mundane topics that will leave the determined reader wishing for a visit from a real hit man. The actual ""contracts"" Keller performes are about as exciting as my trip to the local coffee house on Sunday, they lack any imagination, detail or reason but at least the coffee will keep me awake. I'm sorry, but if possible, I'd ask Mr. Block for a refund on this one, I've read about a hundred books this year in related action/suspense topics and this was absolutely the worst."
4,"Hey, Wassa Matta?","Some of my best friends are readers of mysteries, ya know? And being readers of mysteries, big fans of Laurence Block. And they hated this book...And I can't imagine why. Am I missing something here?Well, ok, it's not nice to be a hit man, and Keller qualifies as the original guy in ""denial"", but the dialog's witty, the protagonist likeable and you get to travel around a lot, finding the best Mexican restaurants. I myself once thought of moving to Roseburg, Oregon and bought a guitar there. So, I like the guy.Also, I learned a lot. If I ever meet a guy with a funny thumb, I'll keep it to myself. It'll be safer that way."
2,Hits in Parts But Misses in Others,"Some parts of this book are really interesting and a great read while others you are fighting not to fall asleep as they are so boring. When Keller is actually on the job as a hit man it is fascinating and must turn the next page to find out what will happen next reading, but when he is not on the job his life is very boring. Stamp collecting, visiting an astrologer, jury duty and things like this just aren't interesting.Basically this book is about a professional killer named Keller who has some competition. Only problem is that his competition doesn't want any, and it soon becomes apparent to Keller that if he doesn't work out who his rival is and kill him first he will be killed himself. If Lawrence Block had maybe concentrated a little more on this aspect rather than the boring chapters he wrote then this book could have been five stars. Without the editing it barely makes two and a half."
4,Beautiful writing--interesting but damaged character,"Keller is a hit man--he doesn't see anything especially wrong with his job although he prefers not to know about his victim's families--it's just how he pays the rent and keeps up his stamp collection. Now, though, something funny is happening. Several of his victims are killed before Keller gets to them. A new girlfriend accuses him of having 'murderer's thumb,' and an astrologer forecasts difficult times ahead.Lawrence Block is a wonderfully talented writer who manages to make such an inherently unsympathetic character interesting and even sympathetic. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't mind Keller's banter and the jury scene. In fact, I think this is part of Block's trick to make us understand how Keller sees himself--just a guy doing a job. I do agree that the conclusion is just a little knocked off. I would have liked to see a little more cleverness in setting the trap for the killer after Keller. Still, I enjoyed this book a lot."
2,Was it really Block who wrote it?,"After reading 'Hit man' (and other 11 of Block's books), I expected great time with this one. Were it some 150 pages shorter it could have given me a good time. But I've ended up with nothing but a long, boring time. I simply couldn't stand all those endless, pointless, funless dialogues, and the looong description of the jury thing."
5,"A good, fast read.","I'm no professional like Patrick Picciarelli, just a somebody who enjoys a good read, and this is yet another of along list from Mr. Block. I highly recommend it."
4,The zen triggerman.,"Would have been five stars but for that HOLY COW SO TEDIOUS section with Keller and Dot on stake-out surveillance and acting dumber than a sack of hammers. It couldn't have been very long, but it felt like roughly fifteen chapters."
4,Excellent book,"I am not a big mystery reader, though when I found myself one october afternoon with my boss stuck on a tedious location, having been dispatch to pickup a truckload of books from a donor, I picked up a copy of this and didnt put it down for about 3 hours. It felt less like a mystery, and more like a made for TV movie, but it sure had a tempo, moving along smoothly, and giving enough clues to make you guess. Sometimes it is nice to just be along for the ride."
2,"Funny and at the same time, a Snooze","Typical Lawrence Block. Funny, interesting dialogue, interspersed with bits of a story. This time, however, the plot took too long to get into, and even with the great dialogue, I found myself bored for much of the time."
3,PRE-SKETCHED Art,"The DVD was OK. Not bad. But it doesn't really teach you to draw comics from scratch. The artist has already ""PRE-SKETCHED"" all the artwork with blue pencil, so you don't get to see him draw everything from the start.With a title like ""From Script To Print"", I was expecting to see the artist draw ""Starting with a BLANK page""."
3,Thomas TOO QUIET,"DISAPPOINTED IN PRODUCT'S PERFORMANCE. Sounds are much too quiet for what it was purchased for--as item was to be used in a classroom. Perhaps it was made for sound function to be heard in a close encounter, as with an individual child. Unfortunately, it did not serve the purpose I thought it would-that it's sounds would be loud enough for the entire class (approx. 16 students)to hear, when the teacher pushed the sound button. This was my best choice, after scouring the internet, for something with a train whistle sound, which did not require using one's mouth to elicit the sound."
3,Fun.. until the batteries die,"My son was so excited to get and play with this train. It's a great train and I would give it a higher rating if finding replacement batteries weren't so IMPOSSIBLE to find (not the typical AA/AAA kind). I have been searching high and low, and would LOVE to know where to buy them. Without the lights and sounds, it's just like any other train.. just more expensive."
2,No longer chugs and toots!!,"This train is really cute and our son was really excited to receive it for his 2nd Birthday in August! Unfortunately by Christmas - just barely over the 90 day warranty - the ""tooting"" sound quit working. We figured the batteries must already by starting to fail because the chugging sound would work occasionally, while the light would pretty constantly come on. We bought 2 new replacement cell batteries, but sadly this was not the fix!! I'm not sure if we just ended up with a faulty train, but it has made us skeptical of purchasing any of the Thomas ""Talking Railway Series"", especially with a limited 90 day warranty. (TOO bad the lifetime warranty wooden Thomas trains used to have no longer exists!)"
3,crackback,"The book crackback has a realistic genre. It was written by John Coy. Also it was illustated by Marijka Kostiw. You got to give them both credit for this book. Because this book is an exciting novel that keeps you focused throughout the time you read. It's a high school and sports book. So if you like sports you will love this book. The sport they are playing in this book is football. High school football is one of the best times for football. The story is revolved around a young tennager fighting for a spot on the varsity fooball team for his school. The coach got sick and a new coach came in and made his life and tough one. The coach did not like the player, and it was a hard ride thoughout the year for the player. If I was looking at this book and I was deciding if i was going to read it or not. Since I have read it I would choose to read it again. I would recomened this book to anyone that love sports and who is addicted to it and remembers high school to read this book."
4,Crackback book review,"Crackback is one of my favorite books I've read so far. I would recommend this book to 6th-9th grade boys and girls that like football or who want to learn about football. Miles Manning is the protagonist in this book and he goes through many ups and downs. The antagonist in this book is Zach because he gave Miles ""Blast"" a caffine pill and steroids to gain muscle. I think this book is a great story aout the life of a highschool football player and peer pressure. This is a great book."
2,Not! so! perfect!,"A little less party-going, a little more character development would have helped this book. And, I can't believe I'm saying this, but there were too many exclamation marks! The whole book! Is like! This! And this! And this! (With a little of this thrown in for good measure.)The main couple, Damien and Caroline, did not have that hot, sexy chemistry necessary for an unforgettable romance. Their scenes together were all a bit ""meh"" to me. Most memorable was when they had sex, because the prose would go purple for one sentence and then the next would be non-embarrassing. It was like the forces of bad and good writing were battling it out on the page. A novel technique! Only I doubt it was intentional.I concur with the other reviewer who said that bringing historical figures into the story was a little bit contrived, though it did show a geeky affection for the time period, and if you enjoy trivia it's kind of neat."
3,A summer read.,"A summer read with some interesting moments, but not as good as I expected. The hero's sister is more engaging than either the hero or the heroine."
3,Still worth a look!,"This is an interesting film as it has always gained mixed opinions. For fans of Errol Flynn it is a highly regarded late career film. Certainly it is the best (and most widely available) of his 1950's swashbuckler movies. Although his looks had matured by the time he reached his mid forties (he was 43 when this movie made filmed in late 1952) Flynn still looked good in costume and was still agile enough to indulge in some well staged swordfights.However, although this film is highly regarded by Flynn fans, it is not by general reviewers. I think this is because they are reviewing the film as a adaption of a famous novel, and in that sense, the film is a let down.However, it is still a colourful swashbuckler from the 1950's and the last to show off Flynn to good advantage and give him a 'meaty' role."
3,"Flynn tries to recapture his ""Captain Blood"" days...","...And does a so-so job. The plot of ""Master of Ballantrae"" is somewhat similar to ""Captain Blood"" (our hero gets on the wrong side of a tyrant, escapes danger to live the life of a pirate, and returns home and/or to his one true love) but in comparing the two ""Ballantrae"" comes off the worse; Flynn looks his age and then some (although he still looks fabulous in tights, even if they are plaid), and his lady love (Beatrice Campbell) is certainly no Olivia de Havilland. On the plus side, Roger Livesey, as Col. Francis Burke, is a suitably entertaining sidekick. I couldn't get into the other characters enough to care what happened to them (the parts of the storyline without Flynn are only average at best), but it's always fun to watch Errol swashbuckling away."
3,From the Highlands to the High Seas,"Flynn may be long-in-the-tooth for this swashbuckling role (he looks a good bit older when donning his tam) but he's still fit and game. This picture may feel a bit more programmatic than his glory days, but it's fast moving and amusing. In fact, it may be too short."
3,Disappointing,"Robert Louis Stevenson's original story of ""The Master of Ballantrae"" is excellent, but this movie hardly follows that story at all. I'm a big Errol Flynn fan, but if you know the original story this movie is a big let-down."
5,Master of Ballentrae,This is a very good version! The Master of Ballantrae with Errol Flynn is a true classic! Goid customer service! AAA+
3,Master of Ballantrae,Last of the action picture made by Errol Flynn. I have read a few comments about this film which I saw as a child a long time ago. But I still like it asm Errol Flynn regardless of his private life is someone especial on the screen.
3,"Not bad, but could use more explanation of figures","Overall, the book was good however, there's one important area that could use improvement. Readers unfamiliar with compiler/intepretor behavior, and also having no exposure to the ""look ahead"" concept in parsing will struggle with correctly deriving valid productions from a given grammar. Generally speaking, ""directional"" interpretion of a string (left to right/right to left, top/bottom, bottom/top) needs to be specified explicitely for students to understand valid grammar and derivation concepts. ""In english"" narrations of each step in a derivation of a string would greatly enhance students understanding of the derivation. Simply ""drawing"" a two dimentional graph with convergent symbols/expressions makes for a difficult understanding of the parsing action taking place."
5,big band jazz at its best,"This album should be a primer for junior high & high school jazz bands starting out. This is the way it should swing. I first heard Woody at Disneyland where his talents were wasted. I went out & bought King Cobra & The Raven Speaks, both excellent albums, Grammy winners at that, but I love this album & especially Midnite Run. All the songs are good but I play Midnite Run again & again. It gives me goosebumps each time I hear it. This group is not called a ""Thundering Herd"" but it should 'a' been or maybe it's lightning. Get it,it's hot. I got it on lp so should sound even better on cd."
3,Phones and serive Overall,"Verizon Wireless sells the 3rd class phones, always months behind decent equpment made by other companies. They do not have any flagship phones that lead their class, or even come close. All their phones that they currently offer do not have WIFI. You would think poeple would decide ona plan based on wifi, at least a few, and that verizon would not want to lose serive.The service has been pretty good and the price isnt that much more. other services like txt, or internet, or extremly expensive compared to other companies. Their stores are the nicest and cleanest and most beautiful of them all, which explains the small room and large crowds that are always there. Service (poeple)always willing to help (but that could be a single store thing).They need a smaller family plan, at least down to 350 or even 400. They also need an internet family plan, i would say for about max50 $, even though their single now is 45$."
3,Current similar plan,"We need a plan with less minutes and therefore less charge. We really use our cell phones only for quick check ins with each other. Also, I have frequently been disgusted with poor connections- can you hear me now? Sometimes- NO. ANYONE who can offer advice about how to overcome this would help. Need three phones- do like the verizon to verizon free calls."
2,Second worst film adaption of a book ever.,"I just finished reading the book, so I thought this movie would be nice wrap.Unfortunately, this one didn't make the cut. It's the worst film adaption of a book since the 2011 version of The Three Musketeers!First, the good. It's well filmed and well acted. The sword fight at the end, billed as the best ever filmed, is very good, indeed.Now, the bad. Even though I had just finished the book, which is excellent, I could not follow the screenplay. Even halfway into the movie little of the books' plot had shown itself, and I could not keep track of the characters, almost all of which had had their names changed. Only some occasional quotes from the book gave any indication that the screenwriters even read it.Also, in certain spots the sound mix has the music so loud that it's painful, and blocks out any dialog.If you want to see this movie, make sure you DON'T read the book first. That's the only hope you have of enjoying it."
4,"The Movie is Great; The Book, Boring!","Like one of the reviewers, I happen to have also read Sabatini's novel. It is true that the movie did not follow the book closely. But why should it? The novel is a total bore! Get this movie quickly, and see the BEST (I mean it) fencing ever put on a screen. And avoid the book like poison."
3,Older movie,"This now my favorite. I felt it was a little slow, but if I had watched it 20 years ago it would have seem more up to date. My husband enjoyed it."
3,Not bad.......not great,"A bit talky for an adventure story. More of a period costume piece. Not so great for kids or those looking for lots of action. Performances are broad. Great color. Much has been written about the closing sword fight and it is long, 8 minutes as I recall. But to these eyes, not terribly engrossing, almost tedious, almost. Not a terrible film by any means, but difficult to recommend."
2,Big Dissapointment,"Having just finished Sabatini's classic adventure story, I really looked forward to seeing how Hollywood put the story on film. What a dissapointment! Simply, the book is great and the movie is mediocre. It is almost a completely different story. On the positive side, there is a nice sword fight in an Opera House. I would not recommend this movie for anybody who loves the book."
2,He is a ScaraSmooch!,"He loves the girls and fights like a very devwil. But he is a very uncouth man and a Womanizer! Don't watch this film if you don't like big boys films that make the women fall over in tears for the bravest and dumbest macho scaramouche! I don't get why the heroine loves him, Why he has a little hussy who he wants too!Well. The Sword Fight horrifying. Lots of slashes and inaccurate swordplay. Devilish grins abound in what was once the LOOOOOOONGEST duel in CINEMA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!See it if you dare and like sorta cheesey Frenchies who don't talk french. I kinda like it I suppose. In the end Scaramouche reforms a little and they live happily ever!And Nappy Boney makes a cameo."
4,Scaramouche,The movie was fun to watch with my 11 year old granddaughter who is very interested in the French revolution. I thought the book was more interesting but the long sword fighting near the end was great.
5,review,This product revived my childhood memories of the movie. It has stood up to time. I was thrilled and my children were too. Shoshana Katz
5,En Garde!,"I admit that I assumed this was another typical swashbuckling film. Boy, was I wrong. This is a technicolor spectacular showcasing the charm of Stewart Granger, fiery intensity of Eleanor Parker and the athleticism of Mel Ferrer. Janet Leigh is beautiful but does not have very much to do here. This is a wonderful film with lots of drama and comedy. I really highly recommend this as a family film. Granger really gets to show off his talent as a comedian. Parker is exquisitely gorgeous and high strung as a gypsy woman. The swordplay btwn Granger & Ferrer is exciting. This ranks with ""Mark of Zorro"" starring Tyrone Power for captivating the viewer's attention."
4,"""As Quick with His Sword as His Tongue.""","The underrated star Stewart Granger enjoys what may be his finest hour in this unique, swashbuckling, comic romance. He rattles off reams of comic patter as effortlessly as he bandies his epee. He also has some physical comedy turns as well, and here as elsewhere he's always lively yet subtle. Would he'd starred in features MGM gave to less talented stars. (""Cough. Robert Taylor! Cough."")If the film (story?) has a flaw it's that the audience is ultimately expected to jettison our affection for the effervescent Eleanor Parker in favor of Janet Leigh, lovely though not at her most engaging.Justly revered for it's swordplay, this gorgeous, colorful production deserves greater appreciation."
1,Broke within 24 Hours of First Use,"Bought this as a replacement for another Sidekick II case which had failed after 6 months of use. Thought this one might last a bit longer, but within 24 hours the clip on the side broke. I guess you get what you pay for. Sigh."
5,Powell's words are like whimsical fairies,"This book is a myth in it of itself! Once you start reading the first page, everything becomes extremely dreamlike. Very surreal and fast-paced and extremely engaging.Even though the language is extremely experimental, it is also absolutely accessible to every and anyone. Powell has done the impossible. She has made something completely new with the English language, and in such a way, that every and anyone (literary minded or not) can enjoy.This book is the start of bringing good literature back to the masses."
5,I'm so glad I came across this book.,"I always do searchs on this page for new books by first time novelists. It's a good way to keep on top of who's who in the next coming years. I would definately have to say that Sophie Powell is going to be up there.The title is a little weird, even a little bland, and misleading. Because I thought this was a children's book. After three words, i was like no this isn't. And is it a book for adults or what!The language is so fresh. It just flows through your ears as delicately as music. I really think this book is an absolute most definate you-can't-ignore-this-rec must read.Once again. Amazing. This is the type of book you read once, then again. Then again and again."
5,I absolutely LUV Lily Newman!,"If you're the type of reader who loves to get caught up in characters, then BUY and READ The Mushroom Man! Lily Newman is an absolutely adorable creature with an imagination and sense of surrounding that will do things to your heart and head.READ this book! You won't be sorry."
1,Not so good.....so far!,"This printer arrived at my house on Friday with my new HP Computer. Man I was excited (yes, i am a dork!). I hooked up the computer and tried to set up the printer, (note-make sure you turn the printer on before you add the ink, seem backwards? did to me, but wont load ink unless its turned on first). Apparenatly this printer is not compatible with Windows Vista yet.... guess what HP is putting on all the new computers? Vista! So now I am having issues even getting this printer to work with my computer due to a software incompatibility.........you think this would of been worked out with the new VISTA roll out!RRRRRRRRR!!!!"
1,Ink hog,"I always purchase HP printers, but this printer has caused me to switch to Canon and Samsung for my new printers. I use mostly black and white and actually purchased ANOTHER laser printer because this HP went through ink so quickly. I also print colored pages (about 10 pages per month--that's all!) and the color ink only lasts for 2-3 months. It has been a huge money pit. Save yourself some cash and get a better printer that doesn't go through ink as quickly."
3,"Printer works fine, software is terrible though.","So far all the printer hardware seems to work just fine. Printing, Faxing, Copying, Scanning all seem to be good. Where this printer falls down is the HP Software. It is as bad as any I've ever encountered with a printer/fax/scanner. I cannot believe that after all these years, this is the junk software that HP gives its customers. And I couldn't believe how big and how long the software installation was.And of course it tries to do auto-updates but the Comodo Firewall that I use intercepted it and let me permanently block it.Luckily I don't do many scans otherwise I would return this and get some other brand. But not Epson (expensive ink and unreliable printers)."
1,run away,"Absolutely, without a doubt, the worst multi function printer out there. The push to scan feature doesn't work well at all, barely compatible with Win7, bad print quality, fax doesn't pick up calls, document feeder is weak - it won't pull mutiple pages through when you're scanning, sucks too much ink.Use a pencil, crayons, and a fax machine at the local Walgreen's. You'll have better satisfaction with the outcome."
1,False Carriage Jam on Both Printers!,"I have this printer for at home and also in my office. Both constantly have error messages for ""Carriage Jam."" There's no carriage jam. If I could, I would take a bat to the printer like in Office Space."
2,Expected better quality,"Had this for about a year. The scanning, faxing, and printing are all OK, reasonable quality, etc. My frustration comes from 4 things, first, the unit had frequent setup problems where a copy of the installed device needed to be created, second the automatic updates always abort install on Vista, third it's an ink hog, and most maddeningly, it frequently has carraige jam errors. Couple that with the fact that the software seems to throw up frequent and annoying warnings whenever a refilled ink cartridge is used and it's not worth the effort - will get another brand next time"
4,Funny and enchanting.It'll grab you!,This book was exellent!Or should I say EXELLENT! Matilda would go through any trouble to help her teacher Miss Honey and to get revenge on her so-called-parents. Roald Dahl did an exellent job on this book! I read it twice!!! :)
2,Disappointing -- and I love Elayne Boosler!,"As a big fan of Elayne Boosler, I thought this tape would have me laughing for days. Turns out, I barely chuckled. I don't know if the material hasn't stood the test of time or if this tape just doesn't do her justice. Either way, save your money."
4,Another Noble Barnes Effort,"Another wonderful read by John Barnes. His books are always enjoyable and fun to read and never take themselves too seriously. ... it was quite good and told an interesting story, although I will say the ending was a little too silly for me. Don't read this book without first having read, ""A Million Open Doors"" and ""Earth Made of Glass"", in that order. These books introduce us to the world of the 1000 Cultures and Giraut Leones, the first person protagonist of all the novels. They are also enjoyable stories, set in a very believable futuristic world.Anyone who doubts Barnes ""predictions"" for Earth 900 years from now, just has to watch a kid play X Box or talk to those people who live in their role playing computer worlds. Barnes just takes this desire of people to want to live in a fantasy world to its logical conclusions. I enjoyed this book very much and can't wait for the next one in the series."
2,Science Fiction Without the Science,"The plot summary for this book is very misleading. Folks looking for an in-depth discussion of the ""psypyx"" and various scenarios involving the misuse of recorded personalities should look elsewhere.Instead, Barnes has created a less than impressive, highly predictable, space soap opera set against a very loosely defined sci-fi backdrop.Interested in reading about the pain of a messy divorce? Enjoy reading about bi-sexual threesomes? Find the endless rehashing of ""Romeo and Juliet"" a thrill? Waiting anxiously for a futuristic version of ""Days of Our Lives?"" If so, Merchants of Souls is the book for you. 352 pages of boredom awaits!"
2,Poor characterization and plot intriguing prognositication,"Notions of nihilism, ultimate entertainments, and cyber consciousness are touched upon from an slightly unusual perspective.Despite being focused on the characters, there is little character development , except for the protagonist, and the book ends without us having much sense of who they are and why they matter. Even with regard to the protagonist, although we get a lot of biographical detail there is less reality to this character that other authors masterfully develop in a paragraph."
5,Well built!,"The equipment I'm using is pretty old and heavy, and I'm positive it's a lot havier than the weight limit for the above shelf. But it works! I used to check every day on the integrity of it and I stopped doing it, because it's SOLID. Glass is a lot thicker than I expected, materials aren't cheap and it sure looks good. Buy it. None better ot there!"
1,"Bad, Bad Book","Ok, the man can do the weather, but he cannot write!! I, too, was intrigued to see what the story would be, but there was no actual plot, the story lines were loose and not well-defined, and the characters were stereotypes of the worst kind. Please, avoid this book!!"
1,Blah,Not at all what I expectedFace is very uglyHad some scratchesDo not recommend this toyNot like the picture in facial features
2,Beautiful but Scientific?,"As pointed out earlier, they film fails to look for the science being done, despite claiming it does. It would make a short film if they did. They could just as well go to an art gallery and ask why (intentionally) unknown artists paint beautiful pictures.What is most important is motivation which is thought to be absent. In fact my work mate at [cellular phone co.] lived in England for over a year. While there he saw the many crop circles come and go. What was most telling was that they would almost exclusively appear Thursday night, just in time to be showed off on Friday's telly. People would come out over the weekend to see them. The poor farmer would have to charge something to compensate for all the people tramping up his crops. Such a routine would not make it into anyone's telling of the tale even though it speaks volumes.Nice Helo shots but spare us the nonsense. See the pretty thing."
4,A helpful introduction to defending the Christian Faith,"In the book, Apologetics to the Glory of God: An Introduction, John Frame gives the reader a sound, understandable groundwork for the discipline of Reformed Apologetics. According to Frame, the apologist must begin with a strong commitment to the Lordship of Christ and must display that commitment through his use of the Scriptures. The book builds on this foundation to instruct the apologist in responding to different philosophical arguments. The final chapter illustrates these principles practically by providing a sample dialogue between a pastor and a non-believer. This book helps prepare the Christian to be a confident witness for Christ."
4,A Good Introduction to Presuppositional Apologetics,"Apologetics to the Glory of God"" is a good introduction to presuppositional apologetics. In this book, John M. Frame outlines three main types of apologetics: proof, defense, and offense. Basic terms of presuppositional apologetics are defined and explained. Charges of circular reasoning are addressed and the short-comings of presuppositionalism are identified. Also, the author discusses the transcendental argument while providing new formulations of the traditional arguments for the existence of God (e.g. the cosmological, the teleological and the ontological arguments). In addition, the author provides an interesting discussion concerning the ""point of contact"" and the ""presuppositionalism of the heart."""
5,A Surprisingly Great Show,"Live at LastHighly enjoyable recording of a Glasgow, Scotland concert from 1999 with Heaven 17 being in great form and Glen Gregory sounding great. Favourite tracks include: Fascist Groove Thang, Crushed By The Wheels, Let Me Go and Being Boiled among the 11 tracks. I love live albums and this is a goody any Heaven 17 or 80's synth music fan should own. Loved it!!"
1,Only for beginner,"This is for beginner. I started fretless recently after playing fretted serveal years, and I was disappointed there is little specific to fretless in this workouts."
1,looks fake!,"the tablets are different from what i got last time!Firstly, it comes in different bottle. Last time, it was herbal supplement as the picture shown. But this time is dietary supplement.Secondly, the color are obviously different! The pills are more yellow than last time! I took picture of that!Lastly, the smell and taste are also different. It smells sweet this time, but the pills i got last time smell like herbal."
5,one of the easiest to use maps/guides i've encountered.,"folks, this is the best idea for a tourbook/map that i have stumbled across yet. i'm not prone to raving, but this will garner praise from me until the cows come home (bearing foot & mouth) no doubt.so, why is this so great? first of all, it's simple and well designed. the city is broken down into sections. you turn to those pages and there is a brief description of places to eat, shop, etc. the pages then open up into a map of the section with a description of major sites in the area.brilliant! no fumbling around a big map trying to find your street. no squinting to figure out where you are. it's easy to find landmarks, metro stops, etc.the card stock is nice and heavy and has lasted well even in my back pocket. the descriptions have been helpful without being too lengthy. and at this price, it's quite competitive with other maps while providing much more."
4,Venice Citymap Guide,"This was an EXCELLENT little book. Of the small pile of guide books that we had in Venice, this is the one that we used most frequently. It's compact, the fold out maps are conveniently devided into sections of the city,and the maps are very clearly readable. I only wish that I had had one for Florence and Milan, too! What a gem."
1,Next to useless.,"I purchased this map based on reviews on Amazon. It is next to useless. The map is divided into sections that fold out. I took a walk in Venice and tried to use this map to orient myself. First, one of the streets I was on in Section A wasn't shown on the map and two of the streets were misnamed. Compounding this, there is no street index. If you want to find a street you have to already know approximately where you are and then scan the map to find the street you are looking for. Try doing that when you want to go to a restaurant and you only have the address. I left the map at the hotel I stayed at (Hotel Campiello--highly recommended). Use it at your own risk."
3,ganz gut,"Hier haben wir eines der Osprey-Hefte, bei dem sich meine Begeisterung in Grenzen hält. Es gibt zu viele Ungenauigkeiten, die einfach hätten vermieden werden können. Schade."
2,BEWARE!,"This is an example of why Osprey books need to treated with great caution. The book purports to be a source for Medieval Russian military history, yet it is full of errors, overgeneralizations, and poor analysis. This is NOT a fair assesment of the Russian realms or their armed forces in the period in question. I understand that there is only so much that can be done in this type of short format, but this is awful. I felt like I was reading college-freshman book report with a bunch of (granted, nice) images attached."
3,Narrative,Nothing special - needed it for class.Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
5,Space savers and excellent quality,"I just want to say that if you need to save space, this is the product you are looking for.* The slim jewel cases are only half of the size than a normal one.* With this cdrs you'll have more space and your cds will be protected* You can take them with you if you have a mp3 cd player or something.* This cds have excellent quality and they aren't too expensive."
4,high quality screws,"These are high quality, self drilling screws. They work well with the Kreg pocket hole jigs, and are also useful in other applications where a self-drilling screw is needed."
4,Pocket Hole screw kit review,The kit is a good value and the screws are of high quality. It would be nice if it included some 1 3/4 and 2 in. screws
5,must have,I have used the Kreg pocket hole screws and a Kreg jig on all of my style and rail projects and firmly believe you get a much stronger and tighter bond with these than the conventional glue and dowel or mortice and tenon joints.
4,Good product,"Good product, but I want more!More lengths, that is... I would have liked some longer sizes of screws for more selection. This is a good starter kit for a decent selection of screws, and is worth the money for that purpose, but if you have a larger project in mind you should look to larger bulk boxes of screws for a more economical source."
1,Whirly Wash needs retooling,"I am beyond disapointment with this product. It's a great concept but the design is flawed to the inth degree because it leaks from almost every connection. Upon inspection I discovered that my unit did not have washers at every connection. The least the folks at Whirly wash could do is supply replacement washers for the unit and solve the problem, does anyone have a customer service number?Contact for whirly wash is Gary Devroy garyd@trillww.com for washers for this unit. Hope this helps!!"
5,Whirly Wash,"I have finally had an opportunity to use the Whirly Wash. I purchased it specifically to wash the 2nd story windows in my house. Doing these by hand is a time consuming chore. I have to climb a ladder several times in order to wash, rinse, and dry each window. It is necessary to use my heavy, adjustable step-ladder because my light-weight extention ladder doesn't get me at working level to clean the windows. Because of the wands on the Whirly-Wash, I don't need to be so high and I can use the lighter ladder. I don't have to climb up and down for each step in washing (soap, rinse, dry). The Whily Wash with car soap does a great job cleaning the windows and I didn't even have to use the squeegee. I got soaked this time but I think I can figure out how to use the Whirly Wash without getting drenched. Even if I can't, the Whirly Wash makes cleaning these windows so much easier; I'll put up with getting wet."
1,What a waste of money,"Ooops I did it again. Believed another infomercial. From the beginning had problems. While washing my car, or rv, the attachment brush kept leaking water out, and kept coming off. Very disappointed, just sitting in my garage. Will never use again."
1,Wash,The worst product I ever bought. Nothing worked as advertised water leaked from every fitting and the brush broke the third time we used it. Don't wast your time or money.
3,OK for cars,"We purchased the Whirlywash mainly to clean the weather boards, but unfortunately it does not seem powerful enough and goes through the suds additive at an alarming rate. OK for cars. The better half thought it would be OK for me too! Bit of an old banger eh?"
4,whirlybird car wash,Works fairly well but you need to be careful on dark cars with scratches in the paint.
1,It's a Joke!,"Got this on Friday 2/4/2011- attempted to use it 3 days later (2/7/2011). Thought is was a good thing to use to get some of the snow dirt and salt off of my truck, didn't expect it to be anything great, but I did expect it to work. The soap dispenser totally exploded the minute I turned it on, spraying water in my face on a 42 degree day - Great! The brush is cheaply made, bristles were left on the vehicle and makes a loud noise. I was totally embarrased when my neighbor heard the sound and came over to investigate my new gadget - it made for a good laugh. Should have read the reviews before buying it. Save your money this thing is a JOKE!! Nice video , poor product.Sharon_MarylandFeb. 2011"
1,"good idea, bad quality",When I received this product one piece was broken. I phoned them and they sent a replacement part right away. It worked great for one wash of my truck and then the same piece that was replaced cracked and was leaking so that more water sprayed on me then my truck. It is a good idea just built so badly that it's junk!
2,does not ring true,"I blame the director Anatole Litvak for this turkey. A film noir type musical with shades of Andy Hardy. I never got gasps of amazement as the cover predicted.It`s as phony as a three dollar bill . Nothing rings true: none of the overacting characters or the story. The music offers some bright spots. They`re just a happy-go-lucky troup, no matter how dire the circumstances. Entertaining as a nostalgia piece but too ""Hollywood"" even for Hollywood. The special features (more than usual) are quite good. I guess they thought that would make up for the film, but Jammin` the Blues was issued on a previous Warner DVD."
4,He's got potential,"The only reason I gave this album a 4 is because I feel like Eyedea can do better, and I can't wait to get E&A, which he himself claims is superior. There are several stand out tracks, but many of them feel a little short or out of place. That said, Eyedea is one of the most versatile rappers out there, as he can go from hard freestyle to smooth flow, and does it all on this album. His lyrics are also almost untouchable."
5,If you don't have this...,"All I can say is if you don't own this, you missed out! In a world of hum drum rap this album is not only great, it's a must listen. I could write some long technical review, but you always have to decide for yourself if something is good. So, if you can find a copy of this album buy it immediately! I promise, you won't be disappointed!"
2,What is this product?,"What is this product? What size images? How many photos does this contain? Is that 24 pages in one book, or 24 books in one order? What is it made of? Does that little seashell shown in the picture come with the book? Why should I buy this product?"
3,All known Greek New Testament Manuscripts known to date,"This book is an exhaustive listing of every known manuscript of the New Testament at the time of publication. It is simply a list, nothing more, no commentary, no pictures. Not for the beginner who will most likely find it a cure for insomnia. Purely for the academic; comprehensive in nature, it provides not only the names, but also the various mss designations given from the different types of naming systems that have evolved over the centuries. A must for manuscript geeks, but a waste of money if your trying to learn about the subject as a beginner."
4,For a Slightly Younger Audience,"This book contains eight original fairy tales. They are a bit better for a younger audience due to glittery descriptions, simple plots and whimsy of the third degree; which can all make stories drag for adults. The stories are also heavily moralizing and/or allegorical, but as the attitudes are modern, this is not objectionable in the least.There is an unofficial but active table of contents, but no illustrations.Stories contained are:The Country Called NonamiaWhy the Wymps CriedThe Story of Honey and SunnyThe Little Princess and the PoetThe Wonderful ToymakerThe Professor of Practical JokesThe Doll that Came Straight From FairylandThose Wymps Again!"
4,Makes writing articles and grant applications easier,"RM now lets you download references directly from the internet, although it can be a little tricky. If you want to download from PUBMED by title you need to pick words in the title and use AND. You cannot just type a sequence of words. You can also link the citation in RM directly to your PDF of the article in My Documents, another time saver. You could avoid RM entirely by using the endnote feature of Word and copying and pasting the citation from medline. But this method fails if you want to submit to a journal that requires references alphabetized, rather than numbered. Scientific writing can be onerous, and RM does make it easier."
2,Internet pubmed search dicey with Windows 7,"Worked fine with Windows XP, but when I installed on Win 7 and Word 2003, RM internet pubmed searches became problematic. Sometimes RM will do them but sometimes they crash the program. Same thing happens in different Windows compatibility settings and with XP virtual machine. A workaround is to use import txt on RM file menu, PubMed.cap filter, then export citation from pubmed itself as citation.nbib file and save in my documents; RM can directly import this file."
4,Great No-Frills Shower Head,"Like another reviewer, I purchased this shower head to replace the same model that I've had for over 20 years which wore out. I was glad to find a replacement. The single spray pattern provides just the right force with low water use. My only caveat would be that, because it is a high velocity aerating head, I think it tends to make the bathroom somewhat more steamy than a lower force shower head, which should not be a problem if your bathroom has even an average fan for ventilation."
4,"Great product, well made, maximum value","We've had one of these for over 20 years and it is just wearing out now. If you want a great shower that happens to save a lot of energy, buy this. It's made in the US by a small company in Connecticut."
1,Waste of money,"This item is a total waste of money. A sincere disappointment. On the picture the item looks sturdy and strong. The reality is it bends and flops around so to utilize this all over your body is not possible. Under the cloth is nothing more than a piece of styrofoam covering the actual device which the handle is strong however as it continues in length it becomes flimzy and not strong and then of course the styrofoam offers no support at all. As far as hygiene? You need more than one cover to wash it properly and it does not come with extra covers or offers any ability to purchase more. You cant return to it for obvious reasons due to the personal use of it when you used it so you basically are out the money. I do not recommend. Not sure what it can be used for but it sure isnt for someone handicapped or with range or mobilility issues. As I said, a sincere disappointment and feel very ripped off.Etac Beauty Body Washer"
1,WHAT'S THIS THING MADE OF???,"Whatever material this thing is made of, it's definitely NOT spongy. The hard plastic apparatus is covered in a removable (good!)pad with a mesh cover. The ""business"" end of the thing--this hard pad and cover--are difficult to rinse out and re-soap on the fly in the shower. It's not very user- or skin-friendly. It seems to require two people to use effectively or safely, which is counter-productive to the independence it should afford those with reach problems."
1,Do not buy this item,"This item was a good idea, but broke the 3rd time I used it. It is not made very well and cracked off at the handle. I would strong advise against this item- was very disappointed."
2,Not recommended,I do not like this product because it comes apart when you use it. It is also not long enough or curved enough.
3,This product needs improvement.,This body washer worked ok for what I needed it for - but it would have been nice if it would have came with a weeks worth of wash cloths instead of just one - or else tell us where we can buy extra wash cloths that go with this. I ended up wrapping my own wash cloth around it with rubber bands to hold it in place. It worked fine that way for a few days until the handle broke apart. I put it together but it just broke apart again. My advice: don't buy.
1,Handle falls off,"I am disabled in a wheelchair and was looking for something to assist in morning clean up.Purchase this in hopes that it would help reach areas I can't.... as stated in other reviews ...The handle falls off... so ok time for epoxy super glue.... handle broke off where glued.Good idea, BAD design. Curved half ok but could be stronger, handle side too soft and not attached well enough.If they went back to drawing board design could be salvaged but as is not worth buying."
1,Etac Beauty Body Washer,"This is the first time that the item bent, broke within the first two days. Normally it takes a year after a lot of use before it starts to go.I am very disappointed in the quality of the product as it was defective from the start. Oh, I did not use it any differently than I have in the past.it was defective, not as sturdy as usual."
2,????????????????,How do you use this thing? There are really no instructions on how to use. I got it for my mom to use after she broke her hip. It is completely useless.

3,Great Book,This book is great for every ministry leader that wants a better understanding of the church's responsibility to the community.
3,Book is too vague,"This book is just too vague in bashing Japanese society. I walk away from it not knowing much more about teaching in Japan other than the author did not enjoy his experiences. I'm sorry to hear that, but respect is a two way street. Are there problems? Are there jerks. Sure, just like in any other country.When people come to the United States from another land they should consider the basic tenets of being a good guest, and vice versa. And people should review the book, not make their own political statements."
3,Seems a little one sided,"Seemed a little one sided to me.I don't think there are many people in the U.S. today who think our public schools are doing such a good job they can't learn from overseas. That is, people employed outside of the education system.I just saw a news story that yet again our children can't find New York on a map."
3,sligtly sensationalized and outdated,"If you are doing research about current (2007) conditions in Japan, this book is rather outdated. However, if you are looking for background information to inform you about how things have gotten the way they are now, then this is a good place to start.A lot has changed since this book was written. Anyone teaching in a metropolitan area in Japan can testify that the draconian conditions described in Schooland's book have all but vanished, replaced by a helpless permissiveness that has lead to chaos in a large portion of Japanese public schools.Schooland does do a good job in debunking a lot of the widely held beliefs about the ""perfection"" of the Japanese education system. For a more contemporary view of education in Japan, I would recommend ""Japanese Higher Education as a Myth"" by Brian J. McVeighJapanese Higher Education As Myth(paperback)or ""Importing Diversity"" by David L. McConnellImporting Diversity: Inside Japan's JET Program"
3,Gunslinger,"I thought this was a little bigger than it was. Was OK as an interactive toy. Not a lot of challenge. The best part is the interactive voices of the 3 Bandits. If they shoot you first they say ""Adios Amigo"".Overall I was a little disappointed."
5,A complete guide for Mantaining an older building,"This book was required for an architectural conservation class which I am currently enrolled in. I have found it extremelly helpfull. Unfortunantly I bought this book at the bookstore for a lot more money. The author gets quite technical at times, however they give you quick insights that are at once complete and easy to read. This is definantly a very affordable guide for home owners, designers, and preservationists of all sorts."
4,Fascinating Information for lovers of old homes,"I bought this as a gift for a friend. He shared it with me after reading it cover-to-cover. Great info for anyone concerned with historic preservation. Not quite the ""handyman"" book I had expected but nonetheless it proved to be some worthwhile reading."
5,Track Info on This Item,"Track List:1. I'm Reggie Rapasaurus2. Mango Willie3. ABC's with Reggie4. Be My Friend5. I Like Vegetables6. I Can Get Dressed7. Marvin the Platypus8. Louise the Cow9. Magic Is Within Us10. Toothache Blues11. Changing Dreams12. The Spectacle Bear13. The Little Flea14. Be My Friend15. Left and Right16. Zip, Zap, Zope17. It's A Head Start Day"
4,Mighty Jackie Mitto,"The man is truly a legend, as is made clear on this fabulous disc. Everyone a classic."
3,customer review,"it was in good condition a litlle bit worn down and it was some what expensive, but overall just what i was needing."
1,Livestock Feeds & Feeding,Description of book's condition was much better than the condition the book was when I received it.
5,Fanfreakingtastic!!!! A must have!!,"I became a fan of Brenda Hoddinott when I purchased ""Drawing for Dummies."" Her methods in art pedagogy are second to none for someone who, even though they've studied art for a long time, have yet to find out how to demystify the drawing process. Get this one, coupled with ""Drawing for Dummies,"" and also go to her personal art education website, Fine Art Education.com, or http://www.finearteducation.com, and if you apply yourself to even a few of her lessons, you'll find yourself much more confident in yourself as an artist and a person. I tried ""Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"" for years (well over one and one half decades), and it doesn't hold a candle to what Ms. Hoddinott has put out."
4,Could be better,"I bought this book because of the rave reviews. It certainly seems decent. However, to me it seems to jump from very elementary steps to finished products without as much help for the in between as it could. I don't know if it's possible to become a decent artist by following books alone without having a ton of patience and perserverence. I think you can learn a lot from this book, but it isn't the bible of self-learners in my opinion."
1,Not what I was expecting,I was looking for a thininer gasket. Unfortunately this one was too bulky for my use.
3,Nothing outstanding,"This guy can do better than this CD - there is not a single original track. But I knew that from the title and the list of the tracks.Yet,I got it since I expected some more drumming than the original, some spice, better arrangement of the background. Alas - none of the above.So you have to ask yourself (an answer) why would you buy this CD rather than the original Fania All Stars..."
4,A feel good read,A well written story. I especially enjoyed the humorous banter between the main characters. A few good twists to keep you on your toes.
1,Amazon...Disappointed with padded shoulder camisole,"Disappointed with padded shoulder camisole I purchased from Amazon. I don't consider this product as having shoulder pads, just a double layer of fabric. Years ago I had a camisole that had an opening in the shoulder to insert shoulder pads (could take them out to wash the camisole) which came with the camisole."
1,Microsoft brochure,"This book is nothing but a fluffy brochure for Microsoft 'advanced' technology. Typical MS style over substance; for a book on content, the book has very little of it. Total waste of money. Check out the much more substantive Content Management Bible ...for an authoritative and comprehensive treatment of content management issues.Just look at how well the price of the used copies (and at how many copies are being dumped) have held up to it's initial overpriced $30. Telling. Price follows demand.The author rating his own book 5 stars to increase the average rating is pathetic and telling. Microsoft is a sinking ship and everyone knows it-their disdain for quality is finally catching up to them. Anyone who continues to pour good money after bad down the MS rat hole of spaghetti code and endless security holes large enough to drive trucks through isn't awake."
4,Cool Cd; but not ska,"People often mistake this blend of music for ska. A few songs have a few ska elements in them, but for the most part, this cd is indie/pop/swing. If you want ska (modern ska, not the real, old ska), listen to bands like the Toasters or the Aquabats. Save Ferris's big song on this cd is ""Come on Eileen,"" but there are a couple other good ones, like ""Nobody But Me"" or ""Under 21."" They're sort of like Reel Big Fish, but more swing-like. If you're into that kind of music, this is worth the money. But, if you're a fan of real ska, you'll be disappointed."
4,Great _second_ CD,"This CD is much better than their third album, Modified, and the tracks that are new and not re-recorded ones from their original CD are great. I have to say that I like the original version of Spam and a couple others better than this version, but otherwise this band is (was) great. Mostly, the point of me writing this review is to correct the misconception that this is Save Ferris' first CD. Everyone seems to think it is, but their first album is a self-titled one with seven songs on it. 5 songs were redone on this CD, but two (also great) songs didn't make it. Check it out."
5,"""It Means Everything"" Means Everything to Me","If I did not have this CD to go to bed to at night, I don't think I could sleep... I mean, I slept before... but after listening to it. Only problem: Not enough music! Save Ferris: Make another CD quick before I do something drastic! Buy it now!"
5,Doesn't get any better than Save Ferris.....,Save Ferris was the first ska band that I ever listened to. Fell in love with them imediately. How many cd's do you listen to without fast forwarding any songs? I don't have to fast forward any songs.... they're all great.
4,I'd buy it,"If you're interested in ""ska-light,"" you'll like this CD. It isn't the Reel Big Fish, but I like it quite a bit. It is a great CD to play if you're getting ready to go out or have a long freeway drive ahead of you. The Come on Eileen remake is great"
1,Save Ferris is simply a joke,"Ok, Save Ferris is a joke to ska. They have no imagination, the horn lines are weak and simplistic, Monique thinks she's some sort of queen, and the music severely lacks originality. Anyone who likes Save Ferris is no real ska fan. It's as simple as that...teeny bopper music."
4,Excellent CD,"I love ska/punk music, but I think I enjoy the vocals on this CD more than anything else. The group's lead singer, Monique, is outstanding. She is quite possibly the best singer I've ever had the pleasure to hear. Her voice is very powerful and she has excellent range. The rest of the group compliments her work very well on this CD. My favorite tracks are Superspy, Come On Eileen, and Goodbye (my personal favorite). The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because -- at least in my opinion -- it's not one of those CD's where EVERY track is a great song. Still, it's definitely a good buy."
3,"Good sound, wrong timing.","It Means Everything by ska/punk band Save Ferris was their debut but unfortantely the magic didn't last for long. The band broke-up in 2002, ska was good music but you knew this kind of genre would not last long. Monique Powell sure had the lungs on such tracks like The World is New, Spam, Goodbye My Friend, Lies, and Come on Eileen. This album fades with time, too bad this band wasn't more successful."
3,Burt Lancaster at his acrobatic best.,"Burt Lancaster and Nick Cravat teamed up many times in their long careers, but never, I think, as well as in the Crimson Pirate. Both are fine athletes and acrobats and turn the movie into a circus romp of stunts and high jinx. Don't worry much about the plot. From beginning to end Burt, the Crimson Pirate, and his sidekick Ojo, Nick, engage in nonstop action and adventure as they swing from yardarms, dash around town, swim underwater for what seems like hours, and fight continuously all the kings soldiers and all the kings men who fall down like dominoes as Burt and Nick punch and kick them down or overboard. They are kung fu supermen slightly before their time. All in good fun.The Crimson Pirate is Saturday Afternoon at the Movies at its best. With a bright clear picture and good sound coming from the DVD transfer, all you need is popcorn and a cold drink for an entertaining afternoon with the kids."
5,Still a Great Romp!,"Watching Burt Lancaster movies in my youth made me a lover of cinema. I can watch ""The Crimson Pirate"" and ""The Flame and the Arrow"" over and over. It was interesting to see how many bits and pieces of ""The Crimson Pirate"" were incorporated in ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" This is not to take anything away from Bruckheimer and company as their final product was quite enjoyable. The fact that Lancaster and Cravat did their own stunts along with great costumes, scenery and music, this film does stand the test of time.The term ""when it was a game"" often applies to baseball in the 1950's, namely the real deal. No steroids, real grass, no special effects. The same can be said of ""The Crimson Pirate."""
3,Hokey but fun,I found this to be an enjoyable and entertaining movie and really demonstrated Lancasters terrific acrobatic skills.
2,Bad Pick,"Subtitles, maybe I missed it when I order? If I know it had subtitles I would have not purchased it."
5,Joy in pirate land,"This is the top of the pirate movies. Humor,lots of action on top of which it's a nice change from all of the deep, dark, movies put out as art. This movie will get a lot of action here in our house; it's a favorite."
2,walkerballs,Walkerballs not worth the money. They were a bit hard to get onto the walker. They work well while inside but wore out within just 3 weeks when used to walk outside as well & went into the garbage.
3,duro-med walkerballs,Love the concept of precut walkerballs but the precut area was too small even for a duro-med walker...Had to make bigger...Did have a snugger fit (when compared to tennis balls that you cut on your own) which may prevent them from falling off which has been more of a problem than wear. Received on time.
3,Duro-Med Walkerballs,"The DUR MED WALKER BALL IS OKAY, BUT I ORDERED THIS WALKER BALL BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD COME WITH THE PROPER HOLE CUT IN IT WITH MAYBE A GROMMET INSTALLED, I BELIEVE A USED TENNIS BALL WOULD WORK JUST AS WELL."
5,Walker balls,I ordered this product for my walker. They arrived on time and work well on the walker.All of the items I order from Amazon work very well.
1,Don't waste your money,I purchased these for my walker and in less than two weeks they had worn through. I would not buy them again.
5,Perfect and adorable,I love these. I decided at one point to purchase the neoprene glides because they do not wear out but they scratch my floors. Finding these was the perfect choice.
4,balls war out quickly,love the balls but seemed like they wore out quickly but it may be the way I use my walker in any event much quieter at first.
1,"Nasty, Hurtful, and Unsocial","I listened to this tape and tried to keep an open mind, hoping it would get better, even though I felt like turning it off a few times. Ms Martinet seems to have a lot of deep, nasty, resentful feelings towards people. Has she been treated badly by a crowd of strangers at one too many cocktail parties? Her advice in dealing with others is to make your self feel superior by putting down everyone else. I work at a school, and we dedicate time to teaching our kids how NOT to act like Ms. Martinet suggests. The snide tone of her voice on this tape emphasises her unkind, unsocial advice. Please, don't follow it."
4,FOR SHY VIOLETS,"Even the most confidant among us has had the uncomfortable experience of going to a party and finding a sea of smiling, talking strangers. Discomfort may turn to knocking knees and a tied tongue when this happens to those of us with an average quota of self-confidence.How do you fit in? How do you begin a conversation with someone about whom you know absolutely nothing? Heaven forbid you mention the weather! Maybe you should just keep eating canapes and leave early!Not at all, thanks to Jeanne Martinet (author of ""Getting Beyond Hello"") and her witty wellspring of advice all of us can discover opening lines that really do the trick, master polite escape techniques, and not only recover but triumph over a social faux pas.The days of terror at teas or being struck dumb at soirees are over because Martinet's tutorial includes The Flattery Entree, the Hors d'oeuvre Maneuver, The Fade (and the Fade Out) plus many more ideas to get you and keep you in the swim.- Gail Cooke"
5,SUperb music for the classics!,"The music from the video games was exactly reproduced with great sounds! I didn't recognize all of the games but those that I did remember brought back memories and I did like some of the tracks from marble madness. If you like soundtracks from some of the oldies, give this one a listen to!"
5,Mixes in to Yogurt and Smoothies well,"I am on the ACAI kick right now as the nutrional benefits seem to be so great. I mix in to my yogurt and it gives a nice sweet kick or put into smoothies, even a strawberry margarita I made! ( Tried to justify making it healthier ). The company that ships this also is very nice and speedy as well."
2,acai - a lie?,"well, i bought this for my wife as it was a better price than the bottle, where the prices are over the top. my wife tried it once and couldn't get it down. said it was lousy tasting. however, if you mix it with juice instead of water, it is much better. as to whether it gives you more energy etc., so far it has done little for my wife. can't rate it higher as there has been no beneficial effects, so far."
1,Very low grade product,"Pure freeze-dried acai berry is very dark purple and it doesn't clump. Also, the price is rather high. Optimum Organics sells freeze dried, organic and vacuum sealed pouches for much less. These type of products are not the pure unadulterated product and the sources aren't even clear. It isn't even organic. If you are going to take the trouble to take a health supplement, it shouldn't have additives or come from sources that use chemicals in processing or treating it or it defeats the purpose."
4,PRO'S & CON's,Pros: Awesome stuff. You will feel a differance. According to people its got all kinds of health benifits. This package is a good size. I usually do 2-4 teaspoons in my oatmeal.Cons: THE PRICE!
4,Used For 1 Month,"I bought this, and it arrived rather quickly. It lasted me just a little over a month. It took a week or 2 to kick in I feel. After that initial period it really helped me to keep my bowl movements regular AKA daily. I couldn't tell if it was working in any other ways until I had finished the package. A wart I had on my foot for almost 2 years magically went away! It could be a coincidence, but...I credit it to the acai powder. I wish this product could help me lose weight though, like I read it's meant to. Nothing drastic, just 5-10 lbs."
3,Mawe Acai Powder 100g Pouch,"The package is small but I already read that in a review. Only took one pouch. I did notice more energy but for me it was not exciting, energizer bunny energy but a ""little engine that could"" type energy. I'm not sure about weight loss. I did not weigh myself before taking. I will be ordering this product or a similar one again to see if there is any weight loss. I am a little depressed right now and it takes a while for products to affect me. I will write another review after I've taken it for a few months."
1,Horrible,"Had I know that there were worms on every plant I would not have purchsed this item. The pictures, when viewed up close are horrible."
4,Not bad for a homemade CD,"I've ordered this CD based on the music selection and nothing else to rely on. When I saw the cover, I considered returning the item to Amazon. It is obviously homemade cover that even I can print out with my $99 printer. However, I decided to be more generous for the sake of the holiday spirit and gave it a try. I was very happy to find that this sounds perfectly fine on Bose system, and I don't see any problem. In fact I like it very much. The music has class and very pleasing to myself and my 2 year-old son...."
5,Solid British Rock,"I recently saw Electrasy open for Buckcherry in my town, and I bought the CD at the show. The show was incredible. The band swaggered with all the clout of a major group and the lead singer had the cocky British attitude of Mick Jagger or the Gallagher brothers. The CD is purely amazing. Dazed and Confused is awesome, as is Morning and Foot Soldierz. This is a great buy for anyone interested in raw, hard, but melodic British rock. I highly recommend it, and I recommend trying to see them live sometime, you won't be dissapointed."
3,ocean music,"i was hoping for just ocean waves. this had nomusic. but lots of annoying birds, and a few ships.i found it a little easier to listen to if ikept the volume low."
2,Not Peaceful Enough,"For the most part, ""Peaceful Ocean Surf"" is a nice, relaxing disc that captures the ebb and flow of the ocean surf. However, the disc also includes some rather obtrusive and downright annoying fog horns too. This disc has something of a ""choppy"" quality to it as it sounds like the surf was recorded at certain times and then hastily edited togther. If you listen closely, you'll see what I mean. All in all, not a bad disc to listen and relax to but if you like the sound of the ocean surf without all the fog horns and seagulls, check out the far better ""Thunder by the Sea."""
3,History,"I purchased the History of the Incas to try for some leadership coherence preceding the takeove by the Spanish. The publication is from a translation of a Spanish captain c.1572 of a history taken from descendants of the Incas. Unfortunately the timing of reigns of Inca kings does not make a great deal of sense to me, although maybe Inca scholars would understand."
1,history or Incas,just not for me I didn't get all the way through it and I started to get bored with it
1,history of the Incas,I find it a bite complicated to read easily. Was not too interesting either. Hard to keep your interest in it.
1,terrible,"I thought this bok to be terrible. Has a person who studied abput these people in school for three yeara and enjoyed it, i have to say that this book was not ithe least intresting.if there was a lowerating this book would not even get o star."
1,Jumbo Puzzle Roll-Up,"Not real happy with this one. All it is is a piece of purple felt and hard cardboard rolls with a belt to keep puzzle and felt wrapped around the rolls for storage. The felt reacts to any movement, so the puzzle pieces you have already put together often ""pop"" apart. If you should catch your clothing or brush against the felt, the puzzle comes with you. For what, about $20.....someone is making a real profit off of naive puzzle lovers."
4,Puzzle Tote,"MasterPieces Jumbo Roll UpMy husband, daughter-in-law, and I have started doing puzzles together while my son is in a care center for recovery from Guillain Barre' Syndrome. We appreciate the convenience of being able to move the puzzle from room to room. My son enjoys playing cards with a group of elderly ladies at the care center, so we can take the puzzle along to the social room when he is there. Other residents sometimes stop at the table to watch or add a piece or two to the puzzle. My son is confined to his bed for much of the day, so we can set the puzzle up on a table in his room when we are there with him. We can roll it up and put it in the closet when we are not working on it, and that way the staff do not have to work around it. We are glad that my sister-in-law told us about this product. It is working very well for us."
4,Worked well!,The puzzle saver worked as was advertized. Only a couple of breaks in the rolled up puzzle. Worth the money.
3,Works pretty well..,"There is some reassembly required when rolling your puzzle back out, but for the most part it does the trick!"
1,SIMPLE PIECE OF FELT,"I was extremely disappointed in this product. I could have gone to a fabric store and bought a piece of felt for $2.00 rather than spend many times more for it. It has no ""sticking"" qualities to stablize pieces of the puzzle. And when I tried to store my puzzle away for the night, it all fell apart with no helpful features to it. Awful"
1,It's just a piece of felt with a cardboard tube.,"Don't waste your money, go to the craft store buy some felt and get a cardboard wrapping paper tube and you'll have the same thing."
1,This Isn't the One You Want,"This item is actually just a piece of felt cloth. If that is what you want, I'd recommend just paying a visit to the local fabric store. Otherwise you probably want to step up to something a little bit nicer (and probably pricier.)"
1,Piece of rubbish,"This is junk, it's just a piece of thin felt that wasn't even cut straight (frayed edges), it had creases in it that would not come out with ironing, and it wrinkles so the puzzle pieces do not lie flat, and the puzzle pieces snag the surface when you try to move them around.If you really need to save a puzzle (I bought the 3,000 piece roll up) save yourself the money and buy a piece of felt from Walmart and use a cardboard tube from the inside of wrapping paper, as that is all this product contains.Disappointed is not even close."
2,puzzle mat,"I ordered this mat for my 89 year old mother to use while putting her puzzles together. I must not have read the product info very well, because this is just a really large piece of felt. Puzzle pieces get ""stuck"" and are impossible to move around. There are also wrinkles in the material, making the puzzle pieces not able to lie flat. When she has finished the puzzle that she is working on, the puzzle mat will go into my craft bin for a recycle!"
3,disappointed,"This does basically what it is supposed to do. The felt is all wrong, its very thick and soft which is incompatible with trying to slide puzzle pieces around, they get caught up on the fibers and you pieces crumble apart. Other puzzle rolls I've used in the past, the felt was smoother and didnt catch the pieces. I bought this because I dont have a table to put puzzles togethor at so it goes on the floor. While I cant criticize the product itself for my discomfort in doing so, I wouldnt recommend this approach. This product isnt high quality, but it does what it is supposed to do. However I wouldnt recommend it. Its also small, I had a 2000 piece puzzle and the border alone took up almost the whole mat leaving me no place to lay out the pieces."
1,Don't buy this,"Don't buy this product if you are really doing a jigsaw puzzle of 300 pieces such as Ravensburger's Oceanic Wonders, described as being 32*48 inches. The puzzle is about an inch larger than the cloth provided in the roll-up and so falls off the ends. If you try to roll it up, the whole puzzle falls to pieces. It might be OK for smaller puzzles but will frustrate you if you try to put a big puzzle on it.I would send it back but I had thrown the box out before I realised it would not work."
3,Don't waste your money,"Although this does what is advertised, all it is is a large piece of felt that you can buy in many stores and just use some twisties to hold it in place. The cardboard storage tubes don't fit together in a way that they stay together; I thought they were just extra packing pieces until I read the instructions.It will get your puzzle out of the way when you need the space for other things."
1,It's a piece of felt and a tube of cardboard.,"I expected this to be a nice, one piece mat that we could do puzzles on, but it's a large piece of thin, folded felt (so there's creases throughout) and a cardboard tube to roll it around that doesn't even fit across one edge."
1,A piece of felt isn't a mat,"I should have read the reviews. When my husband opened the box, I was not happy. It's a cheap piece of felt - all folded and wrinkled - and some cardboard cylinders. Go to the fabric store, buy some nice quality felt, ask for a cardboard roll that some fabric comes on, and you have a puzzle mat! Then put the change in your piggy bank for something else. Use Velcro or whatever to tie the mat shut when storing. It's too much trouble to send it back, but please don't make the mistake I did. No where on the box did it indicate it was felt. What a overpriced waste!"
2,Works...,"I have had this toaster for the better part of a year now. I second all the complaints in the previous review, and add a couple more:The sliders that control the toaster are very easy to accidentally bump. This means it's very easy, while wiping the counter or moving stuff, to knock the ""Function"" slider into bake or broil mode. I've done this many times. I usually notice, but once or twice I've let the thing bake for awhile before noticing. Serious safety hazard. (There *is* a beep when you turn the unit on in any mode, but it's easily drowned out by other commotion.)The inside of the glass door is very hard to clean due to its rising, rather than hinging, action.The thing does work, but I'd take just about any other toaster oven design over this one."
1,Wish I had bought something else,"I bought this because it seemed to be compact for my space challenged kitchen, but after using it I find I wasted my $$ on what should have been considered a quality name brand. First, the pop up door makes it difficult to get french bread pizzas out of the back of the oven without burning the top of your hand. Second the crumb tray slides out the back meaning you have to move the whole oven around for clean up and it's a pain AND Third, it's made out of cheap metal with no non-stick finish so the first time cheese dripped on it the tray became permanently stained. Fourth, the included broil pan is so cheap it rusted the first time i put it in the dishwasher. And Fifth there is NO TIMER for baking a frozen dinner. And Finally there is NO Auto Shut Off so you can easily leave it on for hours by accident. If you are looking at this, you might want to keep looking"
2,"Wonderful film, poor quality disc","I can only reiterate much of what the other reviewers have already said. I really enjoyed the film, which is the bottom line. Yes, the acting is not very inspiring, Robert Taylor never did know how to act, but evidently was a pretty face at that point in time (I was born the year it came out.) But the Technicolor is gorgeous, and the story itself is a powerful one. If the movie makes anyone want to read the historical literature, then it is useful, as well as entertaining. My only gripe is that the disc itself seems to be flawed in its manufacture. I sent the first back and got a second, but it is the same flaw. The picture suddenly changes its dimensions as if it is about to ""go out"" and then suddenly straightens itself out. I've played both copies on multiple players, it is the same on each one. How do we contact the manufacturer to tell them of their quality control error?"
3,"Using ""Knights"" for the classroom","I purchased ""Knights of the Round Table"" for my class after a unit on King Arthur and the Round Table stories. The students enjoyed the movie, and there were many similarities to the Sir Mallory stories, adapted, of course, to be more interesting to the viewing public. This is a very old movie, which is one of the reasons I purchased it, knowing that I would not have to worry about inappropriate language or scenes. (Why can't they still make interesting movies whereby we are not assaulted by obscene language and the almost obligatory dirty sex scene?) The students commented on the phoniness of the battle scenes (I explained that special effects had not been perfected by that time.) Overall, I would use this one again in class."
3,"Dated and Hokey, But Somewhat Entertaining","My primary issues with this movie may seem trivial to many people. However, seeing obviously 1950s-60s era hair-styles and makeup on the women really takes away from this film for me. I am a reenactor by hobby, and we go to great lengths to make sure that our attire and appearance are period. This is not the case here, by any stretch of the imagination. The film is entertaining enough as it touches on the Arthurian legend, but otherwise I was not terribly impressed."
4,The immortal legend,"This is a worthy to watch adaptation of the most important legend of the Western civilization. Lancelot, the bravest among the bravest soldiers under Arthur's kingdom, will have to chose the friendship, the deserved loyalty and the flaming passion in this well known legend.Robert Taylor made (at least to my mind) his lifetime role. Having as partner Mel Ferrer as Arthur and Stanley Baker, the cast imposed itself over a slow paced script.Arresting landscapes and colorfully epic. It will amuse you from start to finish. Ava Gardner's dazzling beauty ignites the screen every time she appears, no matter her passable acting as Guinevere."
3,Good Quality,I purchased this as an oversweater for cold weather golfing. For this purpose it is perfect for me. The sweatshirt was sized correctly and of very good quality and had worn very comfortably.
3,read the fine print: fabrics differ by color,"The Amazon product description might lead you to believe that this product is 90% cotton. However, if you read everything all the way through, you will find that certain colors are a different product made from, for example, 65% cotton 35% polyester. So, be careful. The one I got in charcoal heather will serve its purpose ok, but I would have preferred as close to all-cotton as possible."
2,Over-sized sweatshirts,"The X-Large sweatshirt did not fit my friend who usually wears this size. He is 6' 2"" and 180lbs and this X-Large would fit someone his height but 280lbs or more. The length of the sleeves were great, but the torso and shoulders were very large/wide. A 10 ounce fabric is on the lighter side for a sweatshirt and the inside felt more like polyester than cotton. I was very disappointed with the product and was able to return it, but was responsible for the shipping charges both ways."
3,Enormous!,"The 2 sweatshirts I received are nice quality -- thick and soft, with all the stitching properly done. However, the size chart indicated that a ""large"" was a 42-44 inch chest, but in fact the circumference of the sweatshirt at the underarm was about 49 + 1/2 inches. They did shrink a little when I washed them, but they are still really big on me (my regular size in women's clothes is 8-petite). But I wanted to be able to layer them over sweaters, so I decided to keep them."
3,Get this!,"I first heard Michael when he was playing 2nd guitar for George Benson at an open-air show in Zurich/Switzerland last year. It almost took me a year to find out who he was and where (the US) to get his (first official) CD.It was worth the search! One of the best guitar CD's I listened to in a long time. If you like Benson, Carlton, Ritenour, Tropea (who remembers him?), you'll love this. I guarantee it."
3,Consider others before you buy...,"I purchased this tool at a special price during a sale. There was also a rebate on it at the time. So I bought...The shaper is good quality and I've had no problems with it. Delta offers accessory spindles from .5 in. to 1.25"" as well as a spindle to allow use of 1/2"" router bits. They are overpriced...The fence system is good quality but I don't care for the design. It looks cool... Delta has incorporated a system of hold-downs into the fence that look pretty but aren't terribly functional. I would prefer the simpler wood fence with the spring hold-downs. The micro-adjustment is nice.Overall, 3 stars... The shaper works well and is a nice tool. The fence is not a good as it looks. In my opinion, there are better values to be had from other manufacturers."
4,Plenty of Shaper,"I have owned this unit for about 2 years now. It has done everything that I have asked it to do, and I am a pretty demanding customer. I run a millwork shop and have used this thing for cutting door stiles and mouldings. My only gripe would be the lack of more speed adjustments. 7000 rpm is pretty fast when you swinging a 4inch corrugated head from it. Overall, I am pleased. If you say that Delta doesn't supply great customer support, your crazy. In 15 years I have been in contact with them at least once a year and they are always very polite and knowledgable. I have even had them warranty something that was out of warranty just to be nice. I didn't even have to fuss. This unit has run side by side with the industrial shapers in the shop and has never failed. It is heavy duty, but not industrial. Would be great for a cabinet shop or for a small millwork shop."
5,Brilliant Australian music.,"This is what it's all about --- pure, honest music that soars. Listen to ""your're not the only one"" to get a taste."
5,NOT just for drummers!,"If you're a musician who has to worry about rhythm (which is everyone) this book is a must-read. I'm a guitarist and this has helped my rhythm playing more than any high-priced book, video or lesson out there. Louis Bellson's book forced me to view rhythm in a disciplined manner. Even after working through only 5 or 6 pages, the book paid for itself. It's got enough exercises to keep me busy for a lifetime.Its cover may give the appearance of a sterile high-school drum major's book, but don't let its cheesy orange color (or very low price, for that matter) fool you. This is a serious rhythm book, guaranteed to help you establish a groove, make your music funkier (if that's what you're going for), and give your internal clock a well-deserved workout."
5,Necessary text,Every musician should get this regardless of their instrument. I'm a beginning student (despite having played music for many years)and this has really helped me along with my studies. Its great for recognizing different patterns which speeds up your reading speed.
2,very disappointed,"I am having serious problems with this product. I can only get about 1.5 gb of data on it before problems arise. As I am transferring data, I get the message ""cannot find file X..."" or ""Cannot copy X..."" or something along those lines. When that happens, the already transferred data becomes corrupted, and I have to format the card and start over. Essentially, it's a piece of junk, but I suppose it would work for holding small amounts of data (less than 1.5 gb). But then why not buy a 1 or 2 gb card that actually works?"
2,"Quantity Yes, Quality...?","I bought this book expecting to read an authoritative history of 'Dynasty' similar to Barbara Curran's excellent review of 'Dallas'. Focusing more on the production aspects of the series - the background politics and intrigues surrounding how the show was made each week. Instead what we have here is largely a recapitulation of the show's storylines and characters. Such information is readily available from other sources, and indeed a large portion of it in Judith's book is recycled material. New information is sorely lacking and this book substitutes length (over 700 pages) for depth. As it stands Judith's book has the tone of an overly long fanzine, when what I hoped for was an intelligent book reviewing one of my favourite television shows."
5,The Dynasty Bible,"I received this book a few days ago and couldn't believe my eyes. I was expecting 600 pages like it says on the description but what I got was 704 pages jammed with everything you can think of that's related to Dynasty and The Colbys. I never knew very much about Esther and Richard Shapiro's background but they've covered that nicely. The episode guides are huge! Chapter 12 has candid photos of the cast that I've never seen before. I don't know who Goran Markovic, Helge Ebsen or Robin Wildschut is but Judith Moose must think the world of them because they've each gotten a really nice thank you in the acknowledgements. All in all, Glamour, Greed & Glory is a great read. Thank you Judith and Paul for writing ""The gospel according to Blake Carrington!"" LOL!!!"
1,Not Worth It!,"VERY DISAPPOINTED with this product! A RIPOFF!I recommend NOT purchasing this item. The cost is TOO MUCH for the short amount of video time and with only a FEW songs! Appears to be someone's home product.After happily receiving this CD in a very short time, my expectations crashed.The CD is TOO SHORT in duration. It shows just one fireplace with someone stoking the fire ever so often, DISTRACTING! Cheap!On my original Fireplace CD, with a similar cover photo, there are several different types of fireplaces and MUCH more music and a full HOUR of entertainment!This CD is a complete waste of money!"
4,Visualizations to help you reach your peak performance,"This is the second motivational tape by Belleruth Naparstek that I've bought from Amazon.com (the other one is a weight loss tape, which is excellent). I think that listening to this tape has helped me to become more self-confident. It is a really great tool to help you focus on your goals and help you to visualize solutions. This tape contains an excellent visualization meditation. You reprogram your actions, so that the next time you're in a similar situation you will react differently.I also listen to the affirmations every day in the car. They are very soothing (an antidote to road rage!). I would recommend this tape and any other tapes that Belleruth Naparstek helps produce."
2,"Good, if you like affirmations",The guided meditation is so generic you would not know it was to help you with self-confidence or reaching peak performance. It is basically just a guided relaxation. Side B has affirmations which are soothing.
2,Too Boring For Me,"Great voice and pretty good content, but it either put me to sleep or my mind wandered to other subjects. It didn't keep me focused. I don't think I'm getting what I was looking for."
5,The Many Benefits of Omega-3's,"The author of the The Zone series returns with a comprehensive look of the many benefits the Omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil. He recommends using pharmaceutical-grade fish oil at his high doses to avoid toxins and gastric disturbances.And they are high dosages; the equivalent of a tablespoon of cod liver oil (2.5 gms of Omega-3s) just for maintenance, twice that for optimal cardiovascular health, double that and more for inflammatory pain and neurological conditions. All of these are explained in different chapters. At these doses you will want to get the regular blood tests that he recommends.After reading his book I am convinced. Yet his recommendations won't be cheap. The oil he recommends, his own, will cost $[money] a month for the maintenance dosage. I look forward to seeing the results of adding Omega-3's to the Zone nutrition program."
4,Correction of reneofc's review.,"The book does make some dramatic claims about fish oil, and I have been taking it myslef and have noticed some positive changes as a result. He seems to back most of the claims up with real research results, but as with anything it is up to the reader to determine the benefits for them.I would like to correct the statement by ""reneofc"" that the ""Zone Perfect"" products are from Dr. Sears, they are not in any way affiliated with him or his organization.They took the name, and ran with it, I thought they were Dr. Sears products as well, but they aren't.Having said that, I do like their stuff, and have one of thier bars every day for lunch, and the premade meals are very good as well."
2,The Omega Rx Zone,"As a physician, I read this book hoping to gain some new insights into current thinking regarding dietary treatments and plans. However, the book contains an inordinate number of self-serving distortions, misstatements and speculation.Granted, we do not know all that we need to know in order to treat patients in the most effective way. It may well be that some of Dr. Sears's (By the way, Dr. Sears is a chemist, not a nutritionist or a physician) hypotheses will prove to be correct. Time and science will tell. However, his theories of disease are little more than idle speculation at this time."
1,Trying to sell his own product!,"It seems the only fish oil you can buy is from him only. This is just one long commericial for his products which are way overpriced. He says that cheaper fish oils don't filter out chemicals, toxins, etc. But I personally looked on the back of rite aid variety fish oil tablets and found them free of mercury, cadmium, and dioxins. And they are 3 to 4 times cheaper than his rip off biased fish oil products."
3,Andrew Lessman's Omega 3 Product is the best,"If you want an excellent product made with integrity, look no further than Andrew Lessman. He has done the research and found that high levels of DHA is what is naturally found in cold water fish, which we don't eat enough of to get it through the American diet. That's what our body needs, more specifically, the brain, which is over 60% fat. His pills are small, with much lower levels of fish oil that most of the products out there. Most have more EPA, which is not what is found in nature, ie., fish. So why do most of the products out there have more EPA than DHA? Because it costs more. Also the reason why most supplements are rock hard tablets, not powders in capsules, which is how Andrew Lessman makes his products. It costs more but the produc is already a fine powder, so it gets in to your system quicker and your body reaps the benefits much faster. Think about a rock hard tablet in your stomach. It's a no brainer."
2,"solid concept, poor execution","After reading other Sears' Zone books, I was well prepared for this one. You'll need the other books as primers before reading this one!!!Nonethless, the underlying principal is sound. Unfortunately the information is riddled with self serving proclimations.But it used!"
3,A spiritual seagull,"This movie is beautifully filmed, with magnificent views of towering cliffs and crashing ocean waves. I remember loving the film when I saw it on the big screen in the mid-70s. The story is very inspiring and spiritually instructive. However, I did not really like the sound track. My musical tastes have definitely changed since this was made. When I watch it again, I will turn off the sound track, turn on the English sub-titles and play some music that I like."
4,"Overall, an exellent game.","Starship Tianic is a masterpiece of atmosphere, created by the astounding graphics and music. The problems, though, are near impossable. You MUST have the stratigy guide to get through this game. It takes up LOTS of hard drive, but the conversations with the robots (and parrot) are revolutionary. This is a good game for experienced players."
5,Best game I've ever played!,"I thought Starship Titanic was the best computer game I've every played. The game has the best graphics, sound and being able to interact with the robots is a first. I highly recommend this game to anyone..."
1,Just so much worthless crap.,"I have never seen anything so terrible in all of my natural life. Bad plot, bad characters, bad EVERYTHING! I go into a coma just thinking about it. Well, I didn't actually SEE anything, but it sounds like it could be less than perfect. Maybe."
5,Really Fun!,"The game is so funny and it allows you to type whatever you want. The grapics are great and the music should have a soundtrack(hint,hint,wink,wink) I also thought that the bomb is the funniest thing I have ever heard even though it is a little absent minded. If you are thinking about bying it-DO IT ALREADY- you won't regret it."
2,Shallow and Predictable,"I so want to find lesbian fiction that A) has real lesbian characters (no heretofore straight women struggling with their sexual identity); B) has some form of conflict/tension other than coming-out related angst (""oh, why are such oogy thoughts haunting me?"", ""oh, what would my family/friends/colleagues/deity think?"", ""oh, that heretofore straight women would never want to be with me"", ...); C) has characters rather deeper than a greeting card; and D) has an actual plot, complete with climax and denoument that are not predictable from page 1.After all the good reviews, I thought I'd take a chance on this book. Sigh. It almost meets criteria A - almost all the characters are actual lesbians...except of course the lead character's objet d'amour, i.e. the foundation of the ""plot"" (word used loosely). Nix on B, C or D.The sex is not entirely to my taste, but engaging enough that I finished the book. But that's all this book has to offer. Sigh."
4,"Beautiful, yet not so tough as I thought","I like my new watch. I have to say, it is very nice. Date numbers are a bit small, and a belt-to-watch junction is sensitive, so regardless of it being made of titanium, it is for gentle tempers :) Otherwise, it is beautiful."
4,Not bad,"There needs to be more color in the tubes, for sure, but I found that this worked well and was easy to use. Be aware, though, that not all colors work in all hair. My blonde can pull off the pink well, but in my strawberry blondey/light brown little girl's hair, it barely shows up. I don't think the colors (except maybe yellow) would show up in dark hair. Washes out easily."
3,Tubes empty,"The colors are nice and wash out fine, and the book has great hairstyle instructions. The tubes were almost empty, though. I think this is from evaporation, but there is noting in the book about whether or not you can add a little water (very un-Klutz like to not give more information on the stuff that comes with the book).EDIT: I forgot to edit this in back in 1990: I then called Klutz. They immediately offered to replace it for free. When they discovered that it had recently become out of print, and they offered to replace it with ABSOLUTELY ANY OTHER title they make, regardless of price! Now THAT is the Klutz I know and love! I'm so embarrassed it took me 13 years to correct this, they're a great publisher and creators of cool stuff. The purpose was to warn that anyone who wanted to buy the book should be aware it was past its ""expiration date."""
1,Incomplete And Incoherent,"Like the school, you won't get much of your money's worth here. The philosophy is to listen to conversations, attempt to guess the context, and not speak until lengthy exposure to the Thai language via listening. Speaking and pronunciation is critical in any language, and especially a tonal language with long and short vowels (Thai). I recommend Becker for textbooks and tapes."
2,opteka battery for canon,"short life span even after fresh charge. low power, depletes quickly.price is low so buying extra to get usability still a a good idea."
4,Good Price not longlasting enogh.,The price is excelent for this pruduct but the operation time was poor 1800mAh??? dont think so....compared with the 750mAh.. Almost 400 Shots V.S. 320 with the original battery pack. as you can see there was not a big difference and the mAh is more than the doble. Anyway a dont regret this purchase.
1,Does not fit battery charger,"The batteries (I got three of them) seem to fit my G7 perfectly, but they will not fit the battery charger so I will be returning them. I did not get a chance to use them in the camera as I prefer to use charged batteries, not flat ones."
2,Duds?,"I got 2 of these batteries with the Opteka grip. Maybe I got duds, but after about a month they lost their ability to hold a charge for more than 15 minutes."
3,Good at first but not long lived.,"When new these batteries (I bought a couple) lasted noticeably longer than the Canon battery that came with my camera. Unfortunately, after 6-9 months both batteries really started to drop off in performance. The original Canon battery that is 6 months older than these is still soldiering on reliably while these batteries are almost useless unless you use them immediately after removing them from the charger. They are much cheaper than Canon brand batteries so maybe you still come out ahead if you replace them more often."
5,hasn't let me down even once,Works seamlessly with my Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi - don't have anything other than good things to say about this product.Arun
5,Building a Sliproller,By far the best how-to book I've ever read. The list of material is complete. It is well written. I'm in the process of obtaining supplies to build it.
5,Nice collection of tunes,I play this CD over and over in my car and never get tired of listening to all the songs.
2,not real deep,"Sorry, I listened to this, and while there may be some interesting materials, they don't develop into anything more than superficial drivel.By the way, to one of the reviewers, I definitely find the works of John Cage and Arnold Schoenberg to be more musical. But if it makes you feel better, it is better than Glass."
1,You gotta be kidding.,"OK, I did a search that found no matches but Amazon delivered this work of ""Art"" in response. No, I did not buy it, but I sampled the downloads and, well, you gotta be kidding - this is awful. Not just a little awful, but really really super awful. Do yourselves a favor: turn off your PC fast before you accidently click on any of this offal."
1,About half way back,"Avoid this one, which is a K-Tel release.There is another CD with exactly the same title, including the misplaced grocer's apostrophe, and 25 cuts. It isn't choice but not as bad as this.Only 2 cuts (""Venus"" and ""Kansas City"") are the original release. About half the rest claim to have the original vocalist with at least one original backup singer, but the production and the voices are far short of the original.The rest are by who knows what mongrels."
5,I love this body lotion.,This lotion smells great and is really super moisturizing. I researched for the best price and found a good one. Thanks.
3,Great performance by Rourke,"I thought The Wrestler was a decent film and Mickey Rourke's performance is what sealed the deal. He did a great job in portraying a wrestler who's seen his glory days and is just hanging on to survive. Rourke gives a very subtle, nunanced performance that comes across so naturally.While I didn't really care for the film as a whole, it's basically about Rourke's character The Ram and his performance more than made up for any kind of holes in the film itself. Don't expect to be blown away by the film but if you want to enjoy a moving portrayal of a guy who's down and out yet doesn't feel sorry for himself, I think it's a good film to watch."
4,Very interesting,"This is grim stuff, and not for the faint of heart. It's very sad in so many ways, but takes you on some emotional ups, too (then crashes you down)."
1,Ends Where It Starts,"Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei, Evan Rachel Wood, in fact everyone in this movie performs beautifully. I was taken in from the opening shots of the back of Mickey's head, but about two-thirds of the way through the film, I realized that the plot was going nowhere and stopped caring about the character. The script was coming full-circle to where the movie started, and honestly, I'm sick to death of this kind of unfulfilling story writing. I want to see a deadbeat's character switch, even if minutely. I do not want to watch a deadbeat remain a deadbeat for two hours and end up a deadbeat. This plot goes nowhere but back to the beginning, and you would do well to watch Nacho Libre instead (which, incidentally, has an actual plot with a beginning, middle and end, and you will actually have a laugh. At the end of The Wrestler, you'll just want to slit your forehead open with a broken razor blade.)."
1,"""The Wrestler"" put me in a sleeper hold!","This was a complete waste of film. From the opening bell, thewrestler is lame and boring. No wonder it didn't stay in theaters. Itlacked so much. I know that Mickey Rourke can do better than this. Thestory was cheesey enough, but the wrestling matches, all 3 of themwas even worse than the stuff on Tuesday nights ECW!"
1,WARNING! Portraits wrestling like it's not real,"This movie is actually OK, but it portraits wrestling as if it wasn't a battle to the death. This might be because real wrestling is not suitable to a younger audience which the makers most likely wanted to attract (they play videogames in the movie, as just one example, and the wrestler talks to a couple of kids at one point), or the special effects neccessary to make the death scenes look real were just too expensive. And the fact that a pro wrestler would work in a grocery store when not on stage killing his opponent is hard to swallow.There are just too many errors here to rate the film higher than one star."
5,Great movie!!,"Slow moving drama about an aged wrestler whos trying to fix his life and re-connect with his daughter and make a big comeback late in his career. If youre into movies about people finding themselves and looking for love and acception from family, friends and society this is for you. Outstanding cast and outstanding acting and storyline. Mickey Rourke is great in this movie. He has proven that he can still act. I didnt think it would be that good of a movie, but I was wrong. Great acting, great actors and a pretty moving story.Oh and Marissa Tomei looks great!"
1,A Ten-Ton Truck,"You can predict every plot device in the story coming at you like a ten-ton truck.I have little to add to what others who disliked this film have said.As an acting exercise it showed some remarkable work by Rourke and Tomei.As a movie it was a disastrous pile-up of clichés. If I have to itemize them for anyone, they need to see a few more films."
5,Great acting,"Mickey O'Rourke plays this one to a tee. Besides the thrilling wrestling presentation, there are some very affectionate scenes, especially with his portrayed daughter. The movie proves what some athletes go through. Once the adrenaline instills itself in their acting, they can't abandon it at the risk of losing someone very dear to them. Obviously, it's not only the money that matters to them, but also the fame and excitement of their sport."
2,"Huge wrestling fan, but didn't like this","I love wrestling, both what goes on inside and I love to read about what goes on on the outside. But personally I found this to be very boring and very depressing. Sure there's a great deal of truth to it I'm sure but I guess this just made everything a little too real for my liking. So I just didn't like it, that's all there is to it."
2,Weak Story,"I came into this movie with high expectations. Having seen many real wrestling documentaries and a fan for 25+ years I expected more than this movie provided. The hype from the oscars was just that, hype for another poorly made movie.The premise was good and this had alot of potential. But it had poor character development and story development. It has some decent action/wrestling scenes and alot of [...] scenes. But that seemed to be the essence of the movie. The relationship with the daughter and Pam came across forced and not well developed.The thing that brings this movie from a 1 to a 2 is the documentary ""Within the Ring"" on the making of the film and working with the Indi wrestlers."
2,really beat up for very good status,"I ordered this DVD and while it played okay the case it came in was really screwed up and the jacket had puncture marks all over it. I wasn't really happy with this as it said nothing of the sort of how it looked. While this probably shouldn't be that big of a deal, I basically had to throw the old case away and tape up the jacket cover. needless to say, it looks pretty bad. :("
3,Did he die or win?,"Descent story line, but did he die or win in the ending? I loathe the ""Soprano Ending"" movie makers are using... what a cop-out!"
3,The Wrestler,"I never received The Wrestler DVD I ordered so when it was almost a month since the order was placed I asked for a refund and went to the local walmart and purchased the DVD myself although it was higher priced than Amazon. The seller blamed the post office which seemed reasonable so I will be more careful now when there is something I really want at a bargain price. It's the first time I was let down by Amazon so I am ""twice shy"" from here on. I did get the refund."
3,Rourke is great; film starts good and descends to cornball,"I love the old 1980s-style wrestling that this movie depicts, and was looking forward to viewing it. Mickey Rourke was excellent, no question, as were just about all the actors. And the first half of the film had a lot going for it, as we see Randy ""the Ram"" Robinson try to get by 20 years after his career peaked. Up until the scene where Randy takes part in a modern-style ""hardcore"" match that's too much for his old body, the film is actually pretty good. To explain how it all goes downhill in the second half would require lots of spoilers; suffice it to say that it turns into a maudlin, sentimental Hallmark-TV-movie story, with a hokey ""redeeming"" finish that even Hulk Hogan or the Ultimate Warrior wouldn't have tried to get away with."
1,Really Bummed,"This wasn't a good movie, in my opinion. Mickey Rourke really should call it quits where acting is concerned. Its not that he's that bad of an actor, but his ""talent"" seems to have vanished to only a sliver of what it used to be. And the cosmetic surgeries he's had have destroyed his good looks, which made it difficult to focus on the movie itself. It's as though I could only focus on the oddity in front of me, of this face that I used to recognize. Somewhere behind the horrible face lifts, is a familiar face that can only be seen in bits and pieces. It makes me sad.Sorry for the rambling. Back to the movie itself. It's essentially about a washed up, used up wrestler-""has been"". Depressing, really. I found very little, if anything, in this movie that moved me one way or another. I suppose if you are a wrestling fan, however, you might enjoy it."
3,Sexy,"A wrestler comes out of 20 years retirement to relive a classic match. He hangs out at a strip club. Overall, I enjoyed it."
3,Tragedy of solitude,An aging wrestler attempts following up doctor's advice to change a life-style unsuccessfully as self-indulgence made him closer to none in the world but does his craft the best to a very end.
4,Very good movie and great extra's,I really enjoyed this movie. On Blue Ray it looks fantastic. The wrestlers round table was very fun and gave a lot of insight. Even if your not a wrestling fan you need to see this movie.
4,A picture into pro wrestling's dark side,"This is a dark and depressing tale of Pro Wrestling at it's worst - the drug addicted athletes past their prime struggling to hear the audience one more time. It's filled with black humor, and a grittiness not normally associated with the televised spectacle. The movie has many great performances: Mickey Rourke resurrects his career, while Marisa Tomei shows that she is not past her prime.I give the movie only 4 stars as it is a fictionalization of an even better true story. See ""Beyond the Mat"" for the original story of Jake the Snake Roberts."
2,Movie was okay,"After all the Oscar buzz about this movie, I expected more. I had difficulty determining what the plot was supposed to be, and it just kind of meandered its way to the end. I supposed wrestling fans may get a charge out of it, but it was pretty blah to me."
5,"""The Wrestler""","""The Wrestler"" is a drama about any professional who has his moment of glory and that of overnight loses everything, intonxicado in his triumph does not anticipate the bad times, withdrawal, failure and where inmundisia falls, which can fall any body, a doctor, a soldier, an architect, engineer, etc..Darren is a great director, the wrestler is a great movie.para los latinos, este DVD contiene audio español latino (no muy bueno) y subtitulos"
4,Wrestling Movies,I am a Mickey Rourke fan and a wrestling fan. I like the Movie but neede more in ring action for my taste
2,Watch Monday Night Raw Instead,"A slow burn of a wrestler who's life is in the toilet. Best part was the 48-year old, but still amazingly gorgeous Marisa Tomei as the on-again, off-again love interest/stripper/mother of a small child."
2,cracked case,cracked case. the case was cracked at the top. case was cracked at the top . case was cracked. . .
3,"Okay, but too many missed opportunities.","I like Rourke (showing some rough miles in the face, but built like a bull) and Tomei (getting older, but still a hottie) and they do great with what they have to work with. I think the script could have been better and the storyline drags throughout the first half of the film, with the exception of the graphic wrestling scenes, of which there are too few. You want this character to turn things around and just as he starts to see a bit of light on the horizon, life and/or his own irresponsible behavior takes away his chance to succeed in his effort to connect with the three loves of his life: wrestling, Tomei (the ""girlfriend""), and Wood (the daughter), and in that order. The movie is good, even without a Hollywood ending, but it could have been great with a little more meat in the script and storyline."
3,My husband enjoyed this movie,My husband enjoyed this movie. I thought it was cheezy and fell asleep during it. Definitely more a a guy's flick.
2,Disappointing,"This is an uneven film. The editing is very choppy in parts and some of the writing is almost unbearably cliché and weak. I really expected more from Mickey Rourke and the director, but was delighted by Marisa Tomei's nuanced performance. In the end, it seemed like a big budget student film."
3,Just Average,"This movie was just average for me. While the acting was good, it was not nomination worthy. And the story was nothing I'll remember in a year. There is a lot of hype surrounding this film, but it is not as good as the hype. And you have been warned, the movie has no ending."
4,Well-made but too familiar,"The Bottom Line:Mickey Rourke and Marissa Tomei certainly embody their characters fully and the film gives the viewer some interesting information and insight into pro wrestling (I particularly enjoyed when the crowd cheered when Mickey Rourke smacked the ""bad guy"" wrestler and then booed when the bad guy hit him back) but the general arc of the screenplay is so familiar and trite that the movie consistently holds itself back from greatness; The Wrestler is a good film, but not a great one.3/4"
3,"To me, just ok","So there was a lot of hype around this movie, and I was excited when it finally arrived. But I have to admit, I wasn't wowed by it. It was a good movie but I didn't think it was a great as everyone was telling me it was. The extra were good though, I particularly enjoyed the round table discussion with some of the old wrestler I used to watch growing up, you find out a lot of the guys are still wrestling on smaller stages. Rowdy Roddy Piper is the only one that is still somewhat main stream. But othen than that I can't get very excited about this one, good watch but wish I had rented it."
2,Color Wheel is good blending techniques ??? well no,"I purchased this with a wish that it would give details of colors and how they blend.ie, green leather dyed with a British Tan. Gray leather dyed with an orange.It gave a good color chart. But, the rest was very basic, Discriptions and lists of what you will need. A true beginners book? I would have liked more and I am not a beginner of color, just of the material that I wanted to dye.I am having to make my own examples of leather colors and the effects of colors of dye. I realize that I should have probably just started out testing and kept my money.Oh!If, your interested in saddles and styles....you might enjoy this book."
2,"Nice board, but not as described...","Quality, sturdy board with nice and easy mounting system.However, the product description states ""A factory-installed marker tray keeps markers and accessories conveniently with the board. The board comes complete with a Quartet dry-erase marker.""There was no marker that came with this board. Also, unless the top of the frame is the ""factory installed marker tray"", there is no tray as described either."
2,Board is fine but description is inaccurate.,"I really should've listened to the review written by ""richcip"". There really isn't a marker tray as described, which I really didn't care about. However, the part that really bugs is the fact that it does NOT come with a ""Quartet dry-erase marker"" as described. I just thought that the first reviewer got a raw deal and they had simply forgot the marker but now I know they just never include it. Otherwise, yes, the board is perfectly decent and not cheap looking. Still peeved about the marker not included though..."
2,No Marker Tray as Described . .,I wanted the marker tray like my old board had - one of the reasons why I bought this as a replacement. It didn't come with the board as described in the tech specs.
5,Good product,This was a perfect size for my desk arrangement and is completely functional for it's intended purpose. I put it up with velcro tape.
4,"It's OK, good price and worth it.","I could have returned this item because it arrived with a small crack in the whiteboard. There was no tray to hold any dry erase markers. For me it is fine. It is in a closet, and serves its purpose. This is a basic thing and I knew it wouldn't be top of the line craftsmanship when I ordered it. If you need something that gets frequent use, this ain't it. If you rarely use it, then it is perfect. Enjoy, I hope this review helps."
4,"Beautiful, but hard to put on","I love this watch. It is stunning and classy. I have two other Skagen watches with silver-colored stainless mesh bands, with the identical closure as this one, and it should be just as easy to put on as they are. But I must put this one on my wrist with the face exactly in place on the top of my wrist, instead of locking the clasp and then turning the watch around on my wrist, as I do with the other two. It is much harder to put on a watch this way, and for this reason alone I've grudgingly deducted one star."
2,Path Wise? I can only hope so.,"I have to agree with Kimbo's 2 star report on this one. It would have received 3 stars just for information, but Mr. Illig ruins it.I will probably not ever get the chance to hike this trail from Georgia to Maine, so I enjoy reading others' experiences of their thru-hiking trips. At first, I found this book entertaining. I respected Mr. Illig's determination and the sharing of mistakes he made on the trail. However, as Kimbo mentioned in the review, Mr. Illig is quite preachy to the point of arrogance. Throughout this book, he is critical of others, be it Christians, meat-eaters, or day-hikers. His reported conversations and some of his register entries were offensive enough that I considered putting the book away. Some of his unkind observations could've been kept to himself and it would've improved the book immensely.There are better memoirs out there. Keep looking."
3,"OK, but not great.","I have to agree with some of other reviewers, the author of this account is a little over the top. I am not sure why someone would want to walk over a thousand miles in the woods of Southern Appalachia if they were bothered by (even minor) references to God and Christianity, the eating of meat, and even the telling of ""Yankee"" jokes. The trail is not just for vegan super athletes and hippies, but for everyone who wants to use it. Anyone who has spent any amount of time on the trail can tell you hikers such as the author here are (thankfully) a very small minority of actual trail users...... most people out there are way more laid back in their demeanor whether they be thru hikers, section hikers, day hikers or whatever."
2,Missed opportunity,"This was much more of an ego piece than a trail log. This is the great American trail adventure and the author spent way too much time on downplaying the journey. I get he was in good shape, I also get that he was a total novice when he arrived at Springer. What I don't get is how so much of the experience could have missed the page when he wrote this.Although well written, I couldn't shake the feeling this was an ego piece pure and simple. It was a missed opportunity for both the author and the reader."
1,Horrible.,I hated this book. Rosie and Raider were stupid. The author Jean Ferris needs to get her head checked. That's how bad her stupid book was. How could anyone like this?
1,Ugh,This book was boring. SOOO boring! I couldn't wait to finish it. The story line was predictable and I hated the characters. The romance was the worst part.
4,A really good book,rosie a girl who works in a bar finds herselve on a trip bound for danger. Upon this trip she meets captain Rayder. Can two different people in two different worlds fall in love? can Rosie fall for Rayder?
5,"Excellent,could not put it down....","I have only read Into the Wind, and i cant wait to read the others, as far as it not being shakespere why should these two be compared? also i liked the way it was done, to those who said how could rosie fall in love with the man who killed her father, lets face it, it was an accedent and Raider owed up to it and also her father wasent about to win Fatherhood award of the year, and it states about rosie very clearly that she couldent wait to get out of Campechee. And as far as the person who said that they thaught Jean Ferris should stop writing? well i am also a writer and at least Jean Ferris is a published one, and Jean when you read this dont listien to that, keep writing, i liked the way you presented things, like the impressing of our American Sailors by the British and the way that people are just people, i cant wait to read the other two, too find out whats going to happen with Rosie and Raider..... Sincerly, Lynn"
4,Heart pounding thriller!!!,"These ""Into the Wind"" books are the best books I've read in years. I couldn't put it down. The love story that builds between Rosie and Raider keeps you turning page after page until you find yourself at the third book.. still wanting more. For those who say that it is a horrible book then you obviously haven't read ""A Pirate's Love"" by Joan something or other because that surpasses all horrible books."
4,It is a great adventure,I loved this book the sense of adventure was incrediable and I love books like these. The characters were good and those 3 books were the best out of the American Dreams series by far.
5,I LOVE this book!!!,"I first read this book 2 years ago and then I had my friends read it because I liked it so much and I needed to talk about it. Jean Ferris is a GREAT author and makes incredibly likeable characters. If you don't like this book then you have no sense of adventure and you're a hopeless case. I read a couple of the other American Dreams books but they were boring and shmultzy. Jean Ferris' were the only good ones. Into the WInd is my favorite out of the trilogy because it has the most adventure and Raider's so cool in it. I don't know how you can read this book and not wish you weren't around back then. And to the girl who said it wasn't real enough, who wants to read about reality? Please, write more exciting books, Ms. Ferris!"
1,I did not enjoy this either.,"I did not enjoy this book. I can't believe all my friends decided to read this too for our little club. They didn't like it either. They all thought it was very stupid. I would rather spend time with my horses, I live in a farm."
1,Ugh,"I still can't believe how much I hate this book! IT IS AWFUL! Trust me... these people who think it's wonderful are simply illiterate. If you want a hokey novel with your typical ""Oh, I'm so beautiful"" damsel in distress, buy this. I can hardly believe it passes off for a historical fiction novel. It should be in a subject called ""Mentally deficient trash."""
1,Awful book.,I made a mistake reading this book because it bored me so much. I couldn't wait to finish it so I could throw it across the room.
5,Into the Wind,"I loved this book and all the rest of the series! The second and third books of the series may not be for younger readers but I loved them! As soon as I started reading ""Into the Wind"" I was deaf to the world. I love how I felt like I was IN the story, watching what was happening to Rosie and Raider first hand. I wish I could find these three books for sale somewhere, they're definitely worth the search! Anyway, I would highly recommend the whole series for a fantastic Young Adult Romance Series!"
1,My Thoughts about this Book,My opinion of this book is that it is not good. I hated the characters of Rosie and Raider. The plot was not appealing.
1,Not a good book at all.,"This was not a good example of a romance. Nor history either. May I recommend a few that are good? Why Gone With the Wind, my namesake, is much better than this. And has a good combination of history and romance. The Sunfire books are good, even the other American Dreams books are 10000000 times better than this book! The Hearts and Dreams series is also very good.."
1,Not even touching,"Usually an author tries to make a romantic historical fiction book somewhat touching, somewhat to reach you, but not this book! I think it just wants you to remember how awful it is!"
5,Extraordinary,"Amazing acounts from Mr. Helfer. This book made me laugh, cry, and smile. Wonderful for adolescents and adults alike. Book arrived in exceptional condition."
2,"Great show, crummy DVD","$15 just doesn't cut it for 2 episodes of this show and ZERO extra features. I'm not sure who they are marketing this set for, but I can think of no reason why anyone would buy this. It offers nothing that you can't see in repeats on Cartoon Network."
2,4 episodes doesn't cut it,This DVD should include at least 6 episodes. Either come out with box sets or increase the number of episodes WB!
3,"5 stars for ""Paradise Lost""; 1 star for ""War World""","The first installment benefits from its outstanding voiceover work from Susan Sullivan (""Hippolyta""), Robert Englund (""Felix Faust""), and John Rhys-Davies (""Hades), along with series regulars Susan Eisenberg (""Wonder Woman"") and Michael Rosenbaum (""The Flash""). It also has a slam-bang finish featuring a battle between JLA and skeleton warriors called up by Hades. The fight is similar to Harryhausen's magnificently staged finale to ""Jason and the Argonauts"".Unfortunately, this episode is paired with the worst episode of JLA's first season: ""War World"". There is very little noteworthy about this poorly written installment.One might call it ""Superman in Thunderdome"".There's just very little ""lightning"" around."
3,"One good story, one so-so, wrapped in mediocre presentation","Two two-parters inhabit this disc, both (disappointingly) in Pan & Scan (aka full screen). The title two parter, ""Paradise Lost"" is strong, with a good story, animation and voice acting. The second (and weaker) two parter, ""War World"", is much as it was in the comics - a setting to make known characters get to lay the smack down. The presentations of the story are enhanced by the excellent Bruce Timm introductions - but a word of warning; if you haven't seen these episodes, watch his comments AFTERwards. Bruce always tends to give a bit of the story away. Another aggravating item - Chapter Stops are basically absent; for example, one must sit through (or fast forward) the full intro when watching each episode on the disc. A good stopgap until we someday get Season Boxed sets - in widescreen, please."
1,A Pair of 2 Part Episodes! What a Bargain!,"Warner Bros. seems to have little clue about marketing their DC-based tv series. Whether's it Batman, Batman Beyond, Batman/Superman, or Justice League, they produced only substandard dvds to date. Now Justice League doesn't reach the level of some WB previous efforts, but it's far better than that sad excuse of a series, Teen Titans, now on Cartoon Network. I digress....Anyway, I simply won't fork over money for this DVD containing a lousy pair of 2-part episodes. Come on, WB, either release season box sets or at least offer six episodes, which would be just over two hours in length. I suspect that some heads need to roll until WB realizes that they can both milk and nurture their fanbase, a win-win scenario for everyone. Until such a time, there's plenty else here at Amazon.com to satisfy everyone's DVD needs....."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"THIS ITEM IS A GREAT LOOK FROM THE OUTSIDE WITH IT CLOSED, BUT THE OVER ALL FIT ONCE YOU OPEN THE PHONE TO USE IT IS TERRIBLE."
4,A personal trainer for principals.,"The role of school principal can be very isolated (and isolating) and Roland Barth's book, 'Improving schools from within', is a personal trainer/ coach that all principals need. Barth (like Boyer in 'The Basic School') describes benchmarks of excellent practice and offers collegial advice on how to get there.The thing I liked about the book was that I could personally identify with the issues and the writer's point of view. The book is easy to read, relevant to today's education and it has an heuristic quality even though it was published in 1990.Neil MacNeillPrincipalMarch 1997"
5,Timeless advice,Wonderfully practical and relevant advice for making schools as effective as they can be. Written from the viewpoint of both principal and professor. Sensitive to the issues of both teacher and administrator.
3,"Great vision,but where's the substance?","I approached the book with anticipation of finding answers for me now as a teacher and in my future as an administrator. I was inspired to be a better visionary, but left in the dark when it came to practical applications."
1,Disappointment,"DisappointmentI will begin in that: If the book did not have the third part ofDr. Schmidt, that book would be rated *zero* stars !!!The following sentences are concerned to the first and second partof the book:Patterns ??? I disagree ! Describing a *very* general problem andtelling something like ""Try to do it better"", is not helping at all !Maybe the material is immature, or just written very bad.Not organized at all. I couldn't tell what the... the writer wantedto explain ! many of the details not interesting simply because there arenot attached to any subject of the specific chapter. It was like readinga student work (student that miss all the classes).The third paragraph is very good. You cannot miss a good article ofDr. Schmidt (The father of ACE).The articles are anupdated version of Dr. Schmidt web-site-articles (The problem was that I have already read all most of his articles before ...).Conclusion: Take the money and run."
5,"Gaia, a heroin","I really enjoy the Fearless books by Francine Pascal, I feel that anyone who enjoys suspense mixed in with betrayal, love and mystery should read these books. It might seem like there are a lot, but you'll be happy once you get started, because after you finish one, you want more. And that is exactly what you get, more books to read."
5,grrrr......,"some of you people that write reviews should be more considerate for those who will read them....you explain the endings when ppl havent even freakin read the book! you ruin it for them >:0anyway....i would like to say that this is one of my favorite series and #24 was an awesome book....readers if you likes this series you might like the fingerprints series by m. metz, sweep series by cate tiernan, daughters of the moon by lynne ewing."
3,"No shouting, please.","Ms Wiiliams is a very moving artist, and this recording starts out wiht too much shooouting for my taste. Singing is supereb; selections not up to earlier recordings I hve of her performances."
5,I can't stop laughing!,"After reading Shepherd's hilarious essays about his life, I feel like I've known him for years! This book is pure joy and covers a lifespan of events - from a bad bathroom decision made by a 3-year-old on a train, to a father trying to do the grown-up thing by teaching his son about sex.Delightful!"
4,great crackers-terrible shipping,No pains were taken to ensure the product would arrive in good condition. Really- what good are 12 boxes of broken graham crackers. Very frustrating- will not buy from this company again unless they have more respect for the buyer and fix this problem. Marilyn Brown
3,Healthy but not that tasty,"I bought these mainly for my kids (almost 4 and 1), and I thought they would really like them. They seem to like them, but they do not taste the same as the ""bad"" ones out there. It is probably obvious why. They are not being eaten as fast as I had hoped.My other complaint is that they do not break apart well into the 4 crackers like others do. They are a bit more crispy than we are used to.I might try to encourage them to have them with milk like cereal.The box did come a little damaged, but the crackers seem to have made it alright."
4,Student approved,I actually buy these because they are on the summer reading list for me ELL students. Most students seem to enjoy the books. I have not read it myself.
3,Nothing Special ... To Me At Last,"I bought this book based on the synopsis and to be honest, the book was just alright. I didn't find anything special in it. It had some lessons to teach though but other than that, I don't think the book was anything special. The language in it was sometimes hard to understand but you can get your head around it if you read over it again. I wouldn't recommend it or rate it highly, however, if you feel you must read it. Go for it - it's not ""THAT"" bad."
5,Alive in Miami,"This is a great recording from a much overlooked talent. I saw Deodato a year after this show when living in Venezuela. Unfortunately he didn't have the same line up as this album, but he still Rocked!. This cd shows Deodato at his best playing exciting tracks such as ""skyscrapers"" and ""baubles, bells and bangles"". Deodato's talent lies in his ability to blend Brazilian music with jazz and rock to make an exciting stew that sounds as good today as in the early seventies."
3,looks great just too small,This product is a simple thing and looks like it would work pretty well to avoid blisters for folks who do a lot of crossfit type workouts (lots of pullups!) -- that is why I bought it at least. I struggled to be able to get my fingers through the finger holes and contacted the company wondering about the size. One would think that the XL finger holes whould fit a fellow who wears XL gloves. Not the case! The company suggested that I cut the holes bigger if I wanted to....which I did. That seemed to work better but not perfect. I have since found a better product for this use.
1,I wouldn't trust my wine in this refrigerator,"The temperature fluctuates so much that I wouldn't trust it with swill, much less a good bottle of wine. We put some champagne in it and set it for 45 degrees, the lowest temperature setting. For starters, we like our champagne a little colder, so it's disappointing that this unit can't go to 41 degrees (the lowest recommended temperature for champagne).The unit reached 45 degrees after a day, but now--even though it's still set for 45--it's up to 59! The instructions say that the outside environment can impact the unit's ability to reach the set temperature. Um...in the case, why not buy a cooler? Or, as a friend suggested, store the wine refrigerator inside our real refrigerator? Shame on us for opening the door and shutting off the air conditioning."
1,Beware of this product,"Only had this for 6 months before it stopped working. The thermostat would not go below 71 degrees. I came home one and there was water all over the bottom of the refrigerator. I cleaned the fan on the side in hopes it was just clogged but that didnt work. Fortunately, I was able to get my money back from Crate and Barrel."
1,Total piece of junk,I've had this unit for about a year. It stopped working and started to heat up overnight. This piece of crap ruined 8 bottles of very expensive wine.
3,Poorly engineered product,"I gave it 3 stars because mine hasn't failed yet, but I'm unimpressed with design and I don't have a lot of confidence it will last. It's Peltier cooler based (i.e. no compressor) and requires 1 of 2 characteristics: either a large heatsink (which is a bit more expensive but is more reliable) or a smaller heatsink and a fan. Unfortunately, they chose the smallest heatsink and the fan pretty much runs constantly, which shortens the life. If you don't mind the sound room fan on high, than this fan won't bother you, but I can hear it a room away. Hopefully, it will last longer than some of the other reviewers units."
2,Not impressed,I bought 2 units. One for my business and one for my home. The one at home still works but it was dripping water . I solved it by putting it no top of two wooden sticks so it was not in contact with the floor.The other one's temperature is stuck at the warmest level and it won't go down. I tried all presets and manual settings and it still reads 74 - 76. It's only 3 months old.
1,Avoid like the plague!,"Received CWC-900 as a wedding gift. Now I wish we had never gotten it or at least that I had the foresight to research the model so I could return it.We came back from vacation to find the internal temperature reading 77 degrees. All presets defaulted to 77 degrees. Manually changing temperature settings doesn't resolve the issue as the temperature would return to 77 degrees. (Google search ""cwc-900 77 degrees"" and you will find several complaints). The internal fan is making an odd high pitched whirring noise.Now I have >$1000 of wines having suffered from heat damage and undrinkable.Frankly, I would have been better off stashing my bottles in my garage. Time to consider a more reliable (non-Cuisinart) wine cellar and replace my wines.Thanks, Cuisinart! You have lost a customer for life."
2,"Don't believe the, ""Whisper Quiet,"" claim.","I've owned my Cuisinart CWC-900 for about a week and it is driving me nuts. The fan runs constantly (about 22 hours a day) and is just loud enough to be annoying (sounds like a hair dryer on its lowest setting). For an otherwise well designed and aesthetically pleasing appliance, this is a deal breaker."
1,Stay away. Poorly designed and poor quality.,"The unit started out OK, but after 6 months, it is no longer cooling (unless you consider 77 degrees cool). It began making a great deal of noise about 2 months ago, and earlier today I found that it was no longer making the noise - and the temp was holding steady at 77 when it is set at 58. Poor design and poor quality."
1,"Did not last, stops cooling all together","We received this unit as a wedding present in 2008. Unfortunately, it just stopped working. We realized it after a move. We do not live in a warm climate where cooling would be an issue. Because this is such an old unit, I feel like there is not much owners can do now. However, I would argue with Cuisinart that the unit ""fails its essential purpose."" That is legal jargon that might get you a little further with the customer service reps."
1,Noisy fan unit out of production,This unit is no longer in production because it never worked properly and the cooling fan is loud. The next production unit that holds 16 bottles is worse.
2,Keeps crapping out...,"I am officially done with the Cuisinart wine coolers. Our second chiller in 3 years just crapped out today. I knew it was going when about a week ago the internal temp started to feel warm compared to the display temp, and the bottles were getting condensation on them. About a year ago our 1st chiller went out and because it was still under warranty, we did get a replacement from Cuisinart directly. Now, a year later our second is out. We keep the unit on our kitchen counter top with ample ventilation in back (at least 6 inches of space) and out of direct sunlight. We store red wine, so we are not even keeping it on a super cold setting... Ugh...any suggestions on another manufacturer to try? Maybe vinotemp?"
1,Be warned,Be warned; this thing will absolutely ruin your wine. Stupid $200 unit cost me at least 6x that in terms of wines that are now going to waste. I'm very very upset and wonder what I can do here.
1,I've had two quit working in less than 2 years,This unit is junk. Do not buy. I've had two of them quit working in under two years. One was replaced under warranty and the other is beyond the warranty period. I will not replace it.
1,cooked!,"We were given this cooler as a gift and while it was nice to have a small cooler to keep some of our better wines, it turned itself into an oven and instead of chilling our wine it heated it! When I called cuisinart they said it was under warranty and they would send us a new one if we paid the $10 shipping cost but that we had to send the broken one back to them at our expense and by the way it weighs 30 lbs. We chose to put it out with the trash. I can not recommend this product nor will i buy any other cuisinart items."
2,Disposable; use and then throw away,"This is a good wine cooler but it only lasts about a year or less. Our first unit broke, we contacted the manufacturer and they sent us a brand new unit (which was really nice). However, now the second unit also broke. I feel the price is too high for a product that lasts only a short time!"
1,Noisy and insufficiently cool,"I just bought this item and I am returning it. First, reading the instructions, you will find that for good results, the cooler has to be used in a room where the temperature does not exceed 72 degrees. I want the cooler for my kitchen where, between sunlight and oven use, a 72-degree temperature is highly unlikely. Obviously this is intended for the basement. Second, we have gone to some pains and expense to buy quiet appliances for our kitchen--it's right off our family room--and this is louder than my new refrigerator-freezer! Our experience with remodeling our kitchen has taught us that there are many appliance manufacturers selling mutton dressed as lamb. They figure that an outdated or inferior appliance fitted out with stainless steel accoutrements will pass for a true high-tech appliance. If you want more than a sleek appearance in your wine cooler, this is not the one for you. If the name means anything, this is not one of Cuisinart's finest products."
2,LOVED It until it broke,"This product is currently discontinued. I got it as an engagement gift 5 years ago. For 3 years I had no purpose for it and didn't use it. Then I realized I could use it as a very stylish mini fridge in my office and just loved it for that purpose. (Mind you - it doesn't get as cold as a fridge). Anyway, after unplugging it while on vacation for a while, I came back and it now doesn't work. It stays at 77 degrees and the vents feel very hot. Customer service (picked up quickly and a native english speaker) tried to be helpful but all she could say was to reset it by keeping it unplugged for 24 hrs. I'll try that but am not hopeful since it was being unplugged which is what seemed to generate this problem in the first place. I'll update this if it is fixed in 24 hrs but otherwise, I consider the unit broken. Maybe this is why it's been discontinued. Which is too bad, it's such a nice looking unit."
3,cresides best beggining to slip,"what happened to the wayy fonky mac dre back in the day? sorry but im not really feelin the album, mac dre should stick with the producers like jonny z and k lou. this album is too gangsta for a mac dre album, peace"
4,He's back in full stride... almost?,"This cd is bumpin... mac dre's back, in ful stride. i just got this cd, and its sicc. i didnt realy like the Cutthoat Committee, this is the 2econd cd of mac dre's ive boughten, i listened to him before, and enjoyed everything i heard. so i tryed this cd for a first. In mac dre's the name, Northside shows the talent im lookin for. Every track bumps, even though theres 12 tracks everyone leaves your ear throbbin, and your heada noddin. So pick this one up. its a mac dre collectable"
2,Disappointed with battery,"I am disappointed that the replacement battery has only slightly more juice than the one it replaced. Although I can at least get a few hours out of the battery, I fear I will have to replace it again in just a few months so I would have been better off buying a new phone instead, which I was trying to avoid. Oh well, will know better next time."
4,Wonderful new ensembles!,"This CD presents performances by the finalists of Early Music America's Dorian competition, where ensembles compete to record their debut CD. The level of talent and musicianship on this recording is extraordinary! It is amazing that none of these ensembles have yet to put out a CD. The repertoire and the types of ensembles are varied and your interest is held throughout. Be sure to add this recording of up-and-coming early music ensembles to your collection!"
4,"Like the product, but was NOT what I ordered","I ordered the practice tracks for Rock Bass. I received the practice tracks for Blues Bass, which I already own.It's not my intention to give a negative response to the product because I do like it, and I think you will too. For now I am giving 4 stars because I did receive ""a"" product on time; it was just the WRONG product. Depending on well the return process goes will determine how I update this review.The disc I ordered was a great price. I already have the blues and jazz versions from the Practice-Tracks website, so I don't need a hard copy of the blues tracks.I just need the rock copy.Trader Tom's, help me out here.Thanks,Rod"
3,"Good value at $15, but not $40+",I bought the blues version for about $15 at Guitar Center. I'm happy with the CD at that price. I would be very disappointed had I paid the $40+ that some sellers are asking here on Amazon. It's not worth that much.
2,Knobs difficult to wind,"It seems to keep time well (there is a small lever to adjust the time faster or slower), but the knobs are difficult to twist by hand. This difficulty is exacerbated by the close positioning of the knobs, and I scrape my fingers every time I need to adjust the time or alarm."
5,Thanks for the opportunity!,"Thanks so much for the opportunity to practice the Gongyo, and thanks so much for printing the Gohonzon. I know other feel it sacreligious to print this precious piece, but I am not interested in joining a group and would otherwise have a hard time obtaining this item."
1,OFFENSIVE FOR SO MANY REASONS AND ON SO MANY LEVELS,"I would like to understand the true intent of this product.However as a life-long practitioner of Nichiren Daishonin's Buddhism, this is beyond offensive. The Gohonzon is not ARTWORK.Nichiren said ""I've inscribed my life in sumi(ink), so believe in this mandala with your whole heart."" To xerox a sideways Gohonzon and SELL what's available online for free at SGI-USA's website's kinda disgusting to be honest.Sometimes the worst things can be done with the best of intentions...I don't know who you are, but you HAVE to know that the Gohonzon is not a toy to be bought online. That completely disrespects everything that Nichiren Daishonin was about.How rude. Hey Amazon, I think you should remove this from your stock. Really. This is a bad cause to be making...Wow...a sideways Xerox?"
2,This is awfully helpful to gongyo new comers,"Put the cover issue aside, and focus on the recorded content. The concept of having the gongyo recorded in 3 speeds for beginners is brilliant. I'm finding it useful.On the topic of the cover, I myself overlooked the sideways Gohonzon when I made the purchase. Then again, I'm a beginner and can be given the benefit of the doubt. I'm having trouble with why the producers still ship the product with the sideways Gohonzon if they have complaints?! I can't imagine that's good karma."
1,Shame,"These people should be ashamed of themselves, profiting from profound Buddhist prayers and using the Gohonzon as art"
5,The only thing you'll need,"I don't have much to add to all the great reviews for this book, but the one thing that's important to realize is that if you want to use the ETS PowerPreps as diagnostic tools, you should take both tests before you really get into the guide. I took the second Powerprep after I was done with the guide, and scored a nice ole 800. Of course the fact that I had seen about half of the questions tested in the guide made the accomplishment a slight bit less extraordinary.Another thing - for the math section, even though all the questions in the guide are good practice, only the last 100 or so in each of the math sections look like anything you'll see on the test."
3,Useful but beware,"The 10th edition (along with ETS' CD rom version)is a good resource to learn about the 'look and feel'of the GMAT and to work out on problems of easy and medium diffulty. Beware: the math on the real GMAT is much harder, making the 10th edition somewhat of a misrepresentation of the real thing."
5,Amazing!!!!!,"I scored a 700 on the GMAT mostly because of this book. It has about 1500 sample questions. If you are having a really hard time with the GMAT as I did initially, I suggest the following strategy. First, buy Kaplan's Math/Verbal workbooks. Go over those first and then take a practice test or two. After that, go over this book and, trust me, you will be prepared."
3,"Very useful content, needs better graphics","If you are looking for a very solid, well-written, practical guide to writing research papers, this is a great choice. It begins with a strategy of turning an outline into a paper, then moves into basic statistic and approaches to developing good figures, graphs, and tables that lay out the significant results of the work. (This is a real strength, and not something you usually find in these kids of books.) Then, it follows each section in a reseach paper, providing very practical explanations, approaches, and examples. I would definitly consider this book appropriate to require for a college senior-level scientific writing course, such as a senior capstone thesis course. The only drawback is that this is not a ""pretty"" book. The diagrams are in black and white (helping to maintain the reasonable cost) but honestly not very well done. It really needs a professional layout/graphic artist's touch."
3,"Good book , but look like print out from laser printer",I have just received this book today. the book is in perfect condition. the material inside the book is excellent.but the paper look like photocopy paper and the book looks like print out from PDF file from laser printer.I am very disappointed.
1,"WHITE DOTS, CIRCLES ,HALOS.....................",I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO THE OTHER USER REVIEWS ABOUT THE WHITE DOTS THAT SHOW UP IN PHOTOS TAKEN INSIDE..............WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY...........I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER NIKON AGAIN............
2,"Nice pictures, but it did leave spots occasionally","I received the camera as a gift. I checked the reviews on the camera and heard about the dots on the pictures (I also read that's why Nikon discontinued this model). Sure enough, after only a few days of use, I had dots in about 5% of the pictures. I didn't want to risk it getting worse, so I returned the camera while it was still under the 30 day warranty. It took amazing pictures, and I hated to part with it, but it's not worth the risk of having to deal with a manufacturer later."
1,One star is being nice,I had this for under a month and went out to take photos. I took two pictures and then the screen went black. I took a few more photos after trying to figure out the problem and came home to download black photos and videos.I did some searching online (which I should have done beforehand) and this is not uncommon. Nikon is not backing up the problem either and charging up to $200 for the fix.Save your money for a camera that works. This one ain't it!
1,Nikon Coolpix S5 Spots in the photos,"I purchased the Nikon Coolpix S5 it is a very nice small camera, I loved it , I took about 50 photos with it , then I uploaded it to my computer and noticed there were white spots on the photos , I wrote to Nikon and asked if there was a fix for the problem because I liked the camera so much I wanted to keep it. I did get a very quick email from Nikon telling me that the white spots are normal for small cameras. I have tried 4 other cameras including Cannon and Olympus and even a Nikon model S3 that had no spots. Nikon told me to not use the flash and I shouldn't have the problem. What the real problem is, the Flash is in front of the lens and it is causing some undesired effects with the lens. 6 out of 30 photos taken with the flash had some sort of spots on them you had to look to find them but they are there , I took the camera back, I like to know or hope my photo will be semi ok when I take it."
2,Spots on pictures,"Just like mentioned from other reviews, I too had spots or bubbles on my pictures. Also, most pictures I took where very blurry and seemed out of focus. It also has horrible red-eye. I plan on returning the camera and purchasing another brand."
5,this album is a must have,"this entire album is fantastic. it's the perfect mix of reggae and ska... it's great for parties or rainy days or whatever. the kc white song (no, no, no) is haunting and sweet and will get stuck in your head. it is also virtually impossible to find anywhere else. believe me, I searched for it.if you like old ska and reggae, this album will not be disappointing."
1,Same printer listed separately with a lot more reviews - look around,"I've had this printer for about 8 months. It prints pretty well, and still receives and prints faxes. However, a couple of months ago it quit sending faxes. When I would try to fax, it would make a screeching noise as the scan started, then tell me to ""turn the power off and back on"". It would not be possible to turn the power off, so I would have to unplug it. Never could get it to do any different, but it would still print and would still scan documents. However, now it has started doing the same thing when I try to scan. So I'm pretty much left with a ""one-in-one"" instead of ""all-in-one""."
1,"Great on paper, terrible in reality","Worked for all of 3 hours, then I made the ""fatal"" mistake of actually turning off my PC for the day! The next day there was no way in heaven or hell to make the PC locate the printer on the network.Surfing forums, I realized I was not alone and having already lost 4-5 hours trying to make it work, decided that was enough and returned the printer to the store (didn't buy it on Amazon).Simply put, it's technically a valid product but in reality it simply doesn't work as a network printer/scanner/fax."
5,Porter Cable spray nozzle,"As with Porter Cable equipment goes, the quality of this item was very good. I was looking for a bigger tip for my sprayer for painting. The latex paints have become so thick they won't spray nicely. After some research, trial and error, I was able to put down a nice finish. You need to add Flotrol (up to 25%) and a little water up to (10%.) Put gun pressure up to about 55 lbs. Close down the amount of fluid at the tip. This will atomize the paint better. It takes longer to paint but you don't end up with little air bubbles on the surface."
4,Does what it's intended to do.,"Works real well with spraying ""Fabulon"" polyurethane (Woodworking). I have been thinning it 10 percent with mineral spirits. I haven't tried straight poly yet but I'm confident it not only will ""Atomize"", but will probably work better...I tried the original 1.5mm needle valve today with the 10% thinning and that equally impressed me. It merits 4 stars because it could be a little less expensive. In a nutshell, it works..."
5,Wish I had this years ago,"As other reviewers have said, I also had the 2.0 tip and ended up thinning(watering) down latex to the consistancy of water. Did not work well and took many, many coats to get a good(?) result.This tip took the normal 5-10% thinning and sprayed latex well with good coverage and no runs.I have also used this to spray a wall in a room and it worked great - although much slower than an airless.I wish that this tip had been available when I first got the sprayer. It would have saved me much frustation."
4,Effective Book for Research,"I think this book is highly informative concerning Marquis de Lafayette. My son is doing a book report about Lafayette and my son thought of it as an excellent source because it uses good vocabulary and is easy to comprehend. Although this book tells us his story regarding his assistance to the Colonies and not his entire life, it is recommended in order to obtain information about his military experiences. It is basically a miniature biography and provides the reader with the important points of his life. I understand Alberta Powell Graham has written many more books and I am looking forward to reading them."
5,Very nice,"Looks great, a must have for your E60 if you live in an area with bad weather. Would buy again"
4,fits the BMW 528xi,Very well made mats that fit the car well. Deep grooves trap water and snow keeping the cloth carpet beneath dry and free from water puddling and potential winter damage.
