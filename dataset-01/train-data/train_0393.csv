3,So-So,"I didn't really use this book very much -- It was accurate, but very dry and the book only describes locations by their Italian names without reference to how it is pronounced in English which made it difficult to use."
4,hard as can be,"these guys are fierce. stet lives forever! beats are nice, lyrics are nice, the whole thing is great, this is a classic group."
3,Decent Collection of Alternative Pop Hits,"Good collection of some memorable videos for around 7 dollars.Videos on Disc-1.The Lemonheads ''Into Your Arms'' from Come On Feel The Lemonheads (1993)- Good song, has some concert footage.2.The Replacements ''I'll Be You'' from Don't Tell A Soul (1989)3.Belly ''Feed The Tree'' from Star (1993) Filmed in the woods, another cool song4.Jill Sobule ''I Kissed A Girl'' from Jill Sobule (1995)5.10,000 Maniacs ''These Are Days'' from Our Time In Eden (1992)6.Beth Hart ''L.A. Song'' from Screamin' For My Supper (1999)Overall, small but good collection of some memorable 90's Alternative Rock Hits. 3.5 Stars."
3,The old drummer was better for the band!,"Great band and excellent original songs, however, the original drummer from their 1st CD, Southern Pacific (Studio great Ron Neuhauser), was much better at driving the band and putting all of the fills in the right places. Having seen the band live when they won the SF battle of the bands, a great drummer like Neuhauser makes all the differnce in the bands sound and over all dance feel. Get that guy back and the band may stand a chance to make it big!"
1,A bad copy of 80's cult,"This spin-off series is really just commercial nonsense. Everybody loved the original characters, why did they restructure the complete series?"
2,A ripoff,"The product I received I thought was the first season was really only the first 6. I believe was ripped off because I payed over $50 for this product when I only should have payed around $10 so I will cease to buy for the place again. But I will continue to buy from amazon.com for other items similar to my upset of this item, and many other kinds of items. Even though I believe was ripped off I still enjoyed the product."
1,Why did they cancel the G1 cartoon series?,This new series is junk. Just a bad copy of a cult phenomenon. They would have done better to continoue season 4 of the orignal series...
4,Spyro #2 **I WANTED TO RATE THIS GAME 3.5 STARS**,"I was disapointed when I beat the game in a few hours, but I thought it was a great game when I started.It has nicely done 3D graphics, good re-play ability and good gameplay.It also has several mini-games.(2 I know of) One is a checkers game called Dragon Draughts and the other is called Sprax Panic which I've never played before.You can also play with Sheila (a kangaroo) and Agent 9 the space monkey each with their own UNIQUE levels.There are 19 levels including 4 levels with Sheila and 4 with Agent 9.As well as 3 overworlds (Sunny Plains, Celestial Plains, and Starry Plains with 1 boss in each overworld).I still play Spyro:Season Of Flame to get all of the gems and fireflies on each level to onlock Sprax Panic and to beat the game again and again."
3,"Sadly,",I wish I could give this game 5 stars but sadly I can't.The graphics are neat but the cntrols are horrible.
4,It's good...,"It's a good game. The only hassle is fireflies don't come that often, and for alot of zones you need alot of fireflies to open them. Also, those zones lead to Rhynoc hideouts, and you have to stop the Rhynocs from taking ALL of the FIREFLIES. Therefore, you wouldn't beat the game, which is a big hassle!!! Other than that, it has some great graphics, making the game look like a one-screen Nintendo DS game. Plus, there are some nice challenges, which leads you to crazy things! Also, it has some good music, the kind of music you would hear in Zelda. If you don't have this game and wan't a challenge out of Spyro, you should get this game."
1,Dissapointed,"I could barely get through the first few minutes of the game. Something about the shakey camera work style movement of Spyro made me really sick feeling. And, it was kinda boring."
4,Almost Five stars,"This game is great except for one thing. The screan ""jumps."" what it is doing is centering Spyro to the middle of the screen. So when you stop the action, the screen keeps moving until Spyro is centered. Makes me a little sick after awhile...."
4,Great game,"This is a really good game! One of the high points in the Spyro series! I don't think it's better than the three PlayStation 1 Spyro games, but this is definitely the best GBA Spyro game and fourth-best game of the series! Better than the first GBA Spyro, but not quite as challenging. I'd say the story in this game is equal with the story of the first GBA Spyro (first GBA Spyro is the fifth-best). Graphics seem to look better, and being able to play as Sheila and Agent 9 give it more points. It still has the problem the first GBA Spyro had, though, it's still kinda hard to navigate some levels, but this problem isn't near as evident in this game. So yes, I recommend this game, it is really good. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
5,"Great movie, thanks for not going the DVD-R route.","Wonderful movie that I haven't seen in at least thirty years, and then it was on TV. No features, not unusual in a film from the thirty's, and a very decent copy with excellent clarity and sound.I'm very grateful that this movie, as well as ""The Coriscan Brothers"" has been done on a regular pressed DVD disk, not the damned DVD-R. In my researches I've found that one season stored in a hot and/or humid place can cause the DVD-R disks to degrade. Which is why the local library, may accept donations, but will not buy a DVD-R disk with their own funds.Now, I wonder where and for how much I can get Richard Chamberlains version of TCOMC?"
3,More buckle than swash,"Seeing this movie after around sixty years proved memory fallible. The Chateau d'If scenes were as good as memory recalled, but the action was rather half-hearted. Donat is, as usual, brilliant, and the rest of the cast are good, but production values are mostly average and direction competent rather than inspired. But a necessary part of the Donat canon to see and own."
3,A classic faded with time,"I saw this movie half a century or more ago when I was a teenager and it impressed me so much that I immediately read the book and anything else by Dumas that I could lay my hands on. Unfortunately, the passage of time has not been kind to this production. It shows its age both in acting style and in the primitive production values. The complex plot, which revolves around the revenge inflicted by Monte Cristo on those who did him a terrible wrong, seems to have lost its sting over the years. The villains are not as villanous as I remembered them and the beautiful Mercedes who abandoned Edmond Dantes, is not as beautiful as she once seemed. Time has taken its toll on this undoubted classic."
4,xmas gift for a girlfriend,"The pendant was bigger than I expected (its a good thing). I was scared that it might have broken during shipping, but the pendant is a lot stronger than it looks. The detail is good, better than on the picture. I was not sure about the faerie, but my girlfriend picked it, and she loved it! My favourite is actually the chain that came with it, and the little black pouch. The silvers all went well together.All in all, a nice item for a partner, even if they are over 20."
3,Decent,"Decent quality but pretty much what I expected. The edges of the handles are a bit sharp, though."
4,Hardboiled PI Action in Chicago,"The PI hero in this book is cut from Raymond Chandler cloth. He is the PI Knight Errant.The story opens in 1985 when the number one teen idol is found with an underaged girl in a very compromising situation. This is the last of a series of alcohol fueled missteps resulting in his incarceration in a mental hospital. Eventually, he is released and five years later it seems that he is finally getting his life back on track when he becomes the suspect in a grisly murder investigation.The murderer isn't hard to figure if you pay attention while reading. The clue is there. But the real strenght of this book is the way it grabs you by the hair of the head and drags you through the amoral world of stars and starsuckers. The action never flags."
5,"Stocking Up, How to Preserve the Foods You Grow Naturally","I was very happy with the book and its used condition. I knew it to be a great ""How To"" publication as I had once owned a copy but its borrower also liked it so well that it was never returned. My only criticism is that the on-line order form made it so difficult to make two separate orders with 2 different shipping addresses that three orders were sent to the same address. A very succinct note was included in both orders warning the shipper of this fact. Consequently, it was necessary for the recipient of all three books to mail the other two to me. I finally received my copy and gifted the unwanted third book. Thanks for inquiring. Warm regards, Frank Sebree NEW"
5,Excellent source of healthy guidelines and recipes!,"This book is an excellent source of information on freezing and canning without sugar. Most of the recipes use honey instead. It is so helpful as we have completely eliminated sugar on the SCD diet, and I needed help in knowing how much honey to use in jams, jellies, pickles, etc."
1,Geezer Central!,"This is a warning to whoever wants to buy this movie. DON'T! You are probably making the same mistake I did when I rented this. You probably are a Corey Haim fan and think that he's the star. Well, he isn't. This movie is just about a couple of geezers that are trying to solve a nursing home scam. Corey Haim just has a little part, I think he's like old man's grandson. Even if you don't like Corey Haim, do yourself a favour and don't buy this. It's boring, long, the storyline is stupid and it was made in Canada(that about says it all). I mean I'm Canadian but lets face it, Canadian-made things suck! Well that's about all I can say so, once again, DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!"
3,Boeing Stratocruiser,Loaded with photographs of the 377 this tome is a wealth of information on the working life of this airliner. The text tends to repeat the information in order to cover the spread of photographs. What is interesting is the author gives a complete history of each 377 built and where it ended up.
1,Disappointing Papal Bull,"I was very disapointed in this ""revisionist history""!Much is extremely ""Bias""!The Producers should remember the United States was founded by a ""Freemasons Kabal"". And I would contend the we are better off today for them!The DVD attempts to incorrectly connect NAZI's and ""Illuminati"" and other ""Secret Societies"" (i.e. Freemasons and Templers). The only connection is they are exact opposites in their political beliefs. There is a very strong link to the ""Thule Society""(Germanic Teutonic wantabees) on the other hand which the DVD Producers completely overlooked.From there the Producers try to create a Conspiracy involing the Soviet KGB,GRU and western ""Illuminati"". Need I say more!"
2,Ummm.. OK,"Like others have said, this really had nothing to do with the book. It was an in-depth (if not slanted look) into secret societies. I was hoping for a little more history on the historical places that the book described. There is a major slant to this DVD and honestly, if you are looking for a description of the places and organizations in the book, you need to look elsewhere. This book should be called ""The Secret Societies"".."
3,It Is Important but Frigan Boring,I ws required to read this book fo my CP English 11 class. I felt that it is an important book to read because it hisorically made me aware of the meat packaging problems. However I found it a book I struggled through because of it's boredom but then again it resembled a history book and I alwaays fall asleep during history.
1,Should I vomit because of the sausages--or the socialism?,"This book is fun for its first two-thirds, what with the rats and all. However, Sinclair insists on tacking on a proto-""On the Road"" then tackily tacking on top of that a sermon on the benefits of socialism. Well, the USDA has taken care of the first two-thirds of this book, and the USSR and North Korea taken care of the final third.But maybe we shouldn't be too hard on Upton. How was he to know that socialism was going to cause the deaths of so many tens of millions--maybe causing even more deaths than sausages?"
5,The Jungle Deserves Five Stars,"Ok, this book was written at the turn of century, but what do you think was the single greatest impetus for the FDA? This book is supposed to be fiction, but it is factual. I had an aunt that worked in Chicago in the early 20's and told me what went on with production of candies. YECCH. Read this book and it will change your mind about a lot of what we take for granted.This is well written and deserves to be among the top 100 books of this century. It changed my mind and today I am constantly aware of consumer problems."
4,"Required reading in my college, and rightfully so","Did anyone listen to NPR and their book of the month meeting on ""The Jungle""? Its been many years since I've read it, but often times when I pour milk I think about the poor baby drinking blue milk and dying of malnutrition and a victim of poor living conditions. I didn't think the novel was too political, because Sinclair obviously made enough of an impression on me to remember the characters most of all."
5,The Jungle,Tis book was reccommended by my daughter. I learned much about the struggles of the working class people who struggled
3,And to this day...,"Same struggles with new names and places. Replace Lithuanians and Poles with Mexicans, substitute Chicago for agro-industrial complexes in rural America and try to find a difference. Timely today as 100 years ago."
2,Old classic in a safe form,"Of the numerous editions of The Jungle that are in print, this version is reasonably good and presented in a scholarly form. However, this version of The Jungle is not the original form. It has been drastically cut in length, with much of the slaughterhouse gore removed and the ethnic material cut way back. Readers would be better to get the ""Uncensored"" verion of the novel put out by See Sharp Press."
3,"CreateSpace edition of ""The Jungle: The Uncensored Original Edition","The CreateSpace version of ""The Jungle: The Uncensored Original Edition"" is a knockoff of the See Sharp Press edition. But there are major differences between the two:1) The See Sharp Press edition contains a lengthy introduction and a lengthy foreword explaining the genesis and history of the book. The CreateSpace edition has no introductory matter.2) The See Sharp Press edition contains numerous explanatory footnotes. The CreateSpace edition doesn't.3) The CreateSpace edition is set in considerably smaller type than the See Sharp Press edition.4) CreateSpace falsely claims copyright over this book, which is in the public domain. The See Sharp Press edition does not make this false claim."
4,Finally Read it!,"I've been planning on reading this book for quite a long time. Now that I am teaching 8th grade Social Studies and am on the Progressives, I thought I'd finally take the plunge. It was different from I imagined. All the passages used in SS classrooms deal the meatpacking plants themselves but rarely with the whole book or the main story. A Lithuanian immigrant family comes the US after listening to advertising luring them here. They find out that the wages are higher, and the costs are much higher than they ever imagined. Eventually the family dissolves into homelessness, prostitution, death and despair. The patriarch of the family finds himself eventually at a Socialist political meeting which gives him hope of being treated as a human being. There are vivid descriptions of the meatpacking plants and the corrupt additives used in foods that can kill a person but there is much more. I'm glad I finally read the book and am amazed at how so much of the book is ignored and overlooked."
3,A classic mainly because of its historical importance,"This novel does a wonderful job of painting scenes from the daily life of a family of Lithuanian immigrant workers in the early 1900s. Sinclair produces memorable characters and captures the spirt of the times well. However, it is not a great novel from a purely literary perspective due to its lack of depth and rather uneventful plot. This novel carved out its niche in history by exposing the unsanitary conditions of the meat packing industry of the day. Many credit this novel with setting in motion the wheels that ulitmately led to the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906. This is a book that is worth reading because of its historical impact, but it is does not contain the ingredients of a literary masterpiece."
3,surprisingly still relevant,"This is a finely written polemic on the excesses of pre-World War I industrial practices in the meat business. Shocking in its time, it still holds up as a demonstration of not only sweat-shop labor but of corner-cutting by industry.The writing is good but occasionally windy, and carries the book despite some of the histrionic, over-the-top pro-socialism screeds.Net-net: interesting (if somewhat gross) read, but be prepared for a certain level of socialist invective."
5,The best book,"Hi, I am 16 years old and this book is one of the best books I have ever read. I never usually read books like this, but this book is extordinary.It tells a story about a famlily from Lithuania and their struggle in New York.A must read book"
3,"Mighty scary, but an important reminder of what used to be.","It's amazing. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Exactly 90 years after the publication of ""The Jungle"", I was working for a company then known as Courier Dispatch. Starting pay was $5.00/hr, with an ""increase"" to $5.25/hr after 6 months. A company newsletter bragged about Courier merging with two companies boasting combined assets over $3.8 billion. That's right--billion, with a ""B"". All the while, I was running all over town in a car with over 100k miles on it and not earning enough to buy a car of my own. If I didn't like it, someone else would be eagerly waiting to take my position. Even though the situation wasn't as wrong as that in ""The Jungle"", it still wasn't right."
3,Gruesome look at Industrial America,"Tough book to get through based on the education level of the author and topic but extremely important none the less. This book is the reason the FDA exists today, but interestingly enough, not the purpose of writing it in the first place. Sinclair intended it to reveal the harsh working condition and abuse by labor unions. Once then President Teddy Roosevelt got a hold of it, the world as we knew it was changed for the better."
2,Sinclair's work hasn't aged well,Obama's victim class would applaud. The modern inner city is even grimmer than the early 20th century described here. The language seems stilted but grammar and structure have changed a lot in the past decades.
3,It's heavy,"I couldn't finish the book. It was just too heavy for me, just so sad and depressing. It is an eye opener though."
1,Lack of connection,"Introduction provided poor interest to continue with some very awkward sentence construction. Basically if you think this is a well written or captivating sentence then you may enjoy the book: ""The resulting medley of sound distracted no one, save possibly alone the babies, of which there were present a number equal to the total possessed by all the guests invited."" So basically there is as many babies as there were babies possessed. Stunning."
2,Depressing,"I know this is a ""classic"" and it inspired a better health code for the USA, but....it's such a depressing story. There is no hope in this book. No money, kid gets sick, people dying, getting robbed, etc. Very very depressing. I would not recommend this book unless you have anti-depressants."
3,Over the top exageration forces readers to miss the point.,"The Jungle has many times been critisized has political propoganda. I believe that Sincliar set himself up for that by going over the top with this book. Undoubtedly the working conditions were horrendous in any major city. Even if the story he relates were true (and it is not), the strokes of misfortune that befall our tragic hero are grossly unrealistic. It seems so improbable, it is simple to dismiss. The book also drags on for quite awhile and is written in a dry and passive way. Anything but terse, the exacerbatingly long and dreary prose lack action and life."
1,Read an essay,"Certainly this is a book that had an impact on American history and law, but the novel is a dreadful read. The protagonist Jurgis reminds me of the Li'l Abner character who lives his life under a black cloud. Every tragedy befalls him in a manner that is a test of credulity. I apologize to those students I imposed this book upon years ago. There are many ways to learn about the era without reading this pain and lethargy producing novel."
2,"Upton Sinclair, the ultimate spammer","You feel like you are reading a well written novel until he hits you with so much political spam you forget what the original plot was. he completely vacates the story to go on a tangent. Its like some one telling you a really good story about a trip they went on and half way through saying ""I like oranges! if you don't like Oranges then youre an idiot, my story has been about Oranges this whole time!"""
3,Need Cliff Notes,"I have only halfway read this book, but I have a test on it coming up soon. If anyone reads this and knows where I can get the Cliff Notes for this book, please email me at SatansChylde@yahoo.com THANKS! 10-10-99"
2,Questionably Accurate and Definitely Tendentious,The uninformed reader is not told to what extent the working conditions described in this book actually reflected reality. The socialist solution does not jibe with reality either. Some of the factories in the (former) Soviet Union were just as bad if not worse than Durham's meat-packing plant so graphically dramatized by Sinclair. So socialism is not the answer: respect for one's fellow man is.
4,You may become a vegetarian.,"This is nearly a must read for those interested in the history of capitalism in the United States. Sinclair makes it very obvious that we need to at least have governmental control of industries because a lack of control leads to conditions that are painfully explicated in this novel. Moreover, Sinclair's descriptions of the practices at a meat packing plant bring into full view the barbarism involved in turning living flesh into products that you can put on a shelf. That said, Sinclair's literary style is weak at times because it tends toward direct statement rather than artistic expression. Sinclair also tends toward preachiness about alcohol consumption. This does not detract value of reading this work, and I fully intend to read more of his exposes."
2,Very slow and descriptive!,"The JungleMy eighth grade class recently finished The Jungle by Upton Sinclair. I give this book 2 stars because it is so gruesome. It is a well-written novel and very descriptive but at the same time very disturbing. The book explained about Packing Town in Chicago at the turn of the century and the repulsive way that they slaughtered the pigs and cows. This book upset me in some parts and really got me to think about what I consume, because of the way they described how the animals were slaughtered and how unsafe it was to eat the meat. Also it is definitely a topic that I would not choose to read on my own. I think that The Jungle is a great resource to learn about the meatpacking Industry but I'll warn you not to read it if you are an animal lover.-Bethany LoMonaco"
3,"Glad I read it, but not great",It was one of those books where it just sort of goes on without really any direction and then just sort of ends. Very interesting reading about life at the turn of the century.
3,A little disappointing,"The first half of the book kept my interest, but then it seemed to become a lecture on a social agenda. I know that was the point, but I wanted to read a novel, not a knock off of Das Kapital"
5,great and honest story about the horrible conditions in the chicago industrial complex in early 1900's,"wonderful and frightening story of the struggles immigrants had as soon as they came to our great and flawed capitalist society. it really brings home the point of the grass isn't always greener on the other side. the ways in which they had to live and survive is appalling. it describes in detail the attrocities and manipulation the meat packing company's of chicago commited against them for profits. the sad thing is, though times have changed the game is still the same. i gave it 5 stars because of how well written it was and how captivating the story and characters were. i couldn't help but hope and pray they would find some respite from their misery."
4,U.S. History,"I've recently just read this great book for my US history class and thought of it as something that Ive never read before in my life. How Upton Sinclair describes the struggles of a Lithuianian family living in Packingtown, IL. Even though tragic events happens the family (the ones that is not dead) survives. Jurgis our main character has to deal with the burden of supplying for his family and the temptations of saloons and common brothels. But overall the book is good and I reallly do recommend this book for reading"
4,Highly Recommend,"This is an excellent historical novel depicting the life of immigrants in early 20th century Chicago, the inhumane working and living conditions they endured, and accurate descriptions of early unions and dirty politics for which Chicago is still (jokingly) known. The only part of this book that I didn't care for was the ending Socialist diatribe. After reading this you will genuinely appreciate the social reform that it brought about--I highly recommend this book."
3,I expected a story about the packing industry,"I read this book because it was supposed to make me not eat meat. Well- the gross stuff you here about is all at the beginning. After that, it becomes a political treatise. I was very disappointed to find out the wonderful story about the problems in the packing industry was really just a cry for socialism! The story was good- I really enjoyed it; except for the last couple of chapters when you discover socialism will solve capitalism's problems."
1,Grossly Misleading,"This not Upton Sinclear's novel. It is a comic book, although not described as such on the website. This is not for readers, it is for morons."
1,Kid hates it.,"The paper is fine. The words are good. My daughter needs it for over the summer reading, and hates it. She wants to die rather than reading this. She would prefer to use it as kitty litter."
1,Right...um...whatever,"I was given a choice of nearly 25 books to read for my english class and I can't believe I chose this one. The whole class read about 5 chapters together and that was all we had to do. I got dumb and read the whole thing. I can usually get into a book even if I don't like it and finnish it up but I felt right near making up an ending for my book report. It really didn't live up to my gruesome expectations, I'm not complaining, but the book no matter how discriptive it was just wasn't as visual as it should have been. Its also pretty depressing and repetitive. Anyway, this just wasn't a fun book."
5,Very useful,I needed this book for my son's history class. It was a very reasonable price and in perfect condition. Thanks!
2,The Jungle,"I have wanted to read this book for a long long time. Even though it was written by Upton Sinclair and hailed as a great book, I did not like it. Good story line about the stockyards of Chicago, but I thought the book dragged on much too long. I lost interest about 75% of the way through."
3,Good book,The kindle kept prompting me to review this book... but my girlfriend is the one who confiscated my kindle to read it and I didn't read it. But she seemed to enjoy it as she stayed up late many nights to read this.
3,Tedious to Read,It can be tedious to read as I feel he goes into too much detail to convey the misery of the characters.
3,Propaganda at its best . . .,"I was somewhat disappointed by Sinclair's use of his book as a vehicle for his Socialist ideas. I believe everyone has a right to express his/her opinion, but I genuinely feel that he tricked the reader. He held my attention throughout the book through the character of Jurgis, and then turned Jurgis into nothing more than another lackey for the Socialist Party. It is an important novel for anyone who would like to better understand the situation of labor in America to read, but honestly, the last fifty pages could just be skipped. - To that reader from Colorado: I think it is encouraging that our youth is confident enough to feel they have the right to submit a book review. It makes me feel good that a high school junior spent his/her time at this site rather than on the street. Stop being such a snob and accept the growth and improvement of others!"
4,Immigrants Revealed,"This book is about an immigrant family from Lithuania. They are expecting to come to an industrialized and modern country with money, if they work hard. They end up in Chicago working in the meat-packing industry. All sorts of tragedies unfold.This is an amazing book which inspired even President Theodore Roosevelt. I would wait to read it until high school though, since I'm in junior high and it's a little difficult for me."
4,Life in an Urban Jungle,"Everyone has heard of this book, but few have read it. It is NOT a muck-raking investigation into the meat processing industry! It is a novel about an immigrant European family that comes to Chicago (at the end of the century) and is destroyed in that urban jungle. Drugs, crime, and prostitution are not new problems.A few pages in that book describe the workings of a meat processing plant. All too true, as the later investigations proved. The character who worked there was later hospitalized, and found out where the market was for sub-standard goods: institutions where the consumers have no choice! Remember, there had been scandals about ""embalmed beef"" during the Spanish-American War.The book is still as entertaining and educational today as it was when it was first published. Are things different today? Not if you read some current reports."
4,Good book,"I really enjoyed reading this novel. The description of the meatpacking plants, however, made my stomach churn. Nonetheless, Upton Sinclair created a historical masterpiece. This book will make you sad; it will make you reflect. I am only giving it four stars because the Socialist propaganda at the end was a little much for me,but don't let it deter you from reading the touching journey of poor Jurgis Rudkus."
4,Good book!,No changes from the printed version to the e-book. It was fun to read this classic again - worth the time.
3,Surprisingly Good,"I was required to read ""The Jungle"" for one of my college courses. Under normal circumstances, I would not have read a book like this. History is not my bag. However, once the slow beginning comes to an end, the plot really picks up momentum. Sinclair writes of a poor family of immigrants who come to America with pipe dreams of fortune and glory. The protagonist, Jurgis, scrounges for work in the Chicago stockyards, and finally lands at the meat-packing factory, where Sinclair turns your stomach with the horrors of what actually went into the sausage grinders. Jurgis eventually loses everything, his wife, his children, his brother, and sets out on a journey to mend his broken life and shattered dreams. The plot becomes very character-oriented, and though the writing is not very smooth, the description is very imaginative and real. The ending was rather disappointing, but if you have to read this book for school, don't sweat it. You might enjoy it. I did."
3,Reformist Literature at its Best,"THE JUNGLE is a reasonably competent novel: it holds your interest, you get involved with the characters, and the background of the story is vivid and informative. I would say that Sinclair's political aims sometimes get in the way of his literary ambitions, especially in the turgid pro-socialism section at the end, when Jurgis, the main character, finds salvation. However, as a book in which the evils of capitalism are brilliantly displayed in a way which cannot fail to move a reader, and as a cry for justice for immigrants, reform of meat packing, and improvement of the conditions of the working man, this book has no competition. It is a monument in the history of American literature. Sinclair gives an unparalleled picture of the devastated lives of Chicago workers. You can also read this book and ponder on how far we have come in one century. America may still have far to go, but after reading this book, you will know how far we have come."
2,Great Beginning. Terrible Ending,"The Jungle starts out as a compelling story about Jurgis his family and their struggle for the ""American Dream"". Sinclair does a wonderful job conveying just how horrible life was in Packingtown. Sadly the last third of the book falls into a sermon about the glories of socialism. Sinclair had a great story going. We can only wish that he had finished it."
3,Who Owns Chicago Today?,"While I was more than a hundred pages into The Jungle and with more than 200 to go, I wondered how much longer I could take of the cruel life suffered by Jurgis and his family. What I did not expect was for the novel to evolve in a near-Dickens move of running into a rich man on the brink of death and taking Jurgis from pauper to prince. The Jungle hasn't aged poorly, but I can't say it was enjoyable in the sense of good ole fiction. Instead it remained interesting because I read it as a historian for the second half. Some think it's not great literature - maybe this is because Jurgis feels at times like a film camera which Sinclair darts around Chicago for his political motives. Nothing makes this clearer than the last page. But that doesn't mean many parts aren't heartfelt. I'll remember this book for its history, its romanticism, and its reactions - then fresh - to American capitalism."
2,A very well written book.,"THE JUNGLE I am in eighth grade and in my language arts class we have recently finished the book, The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair. I give this book two stars, because it was very well written, except the topic of the book isn't one that I would have picked to read for fun.The Jungle had a lot of description, especially about the meatpacking industry, which really disgusted me. The plight of the immigrants was really depressing; their living conditions were disgraceful. The food and working situations were also awful."
3,Historically Imporant,"One of the more important historical primary sources pertaining to the understanding of public opinion around the turn of the century; it is a classic example of effective muckraking. The book is not a great literary work. It is, however, well written. The book was intended to send political message that is now dated and gives a fictional account of a real situation. In short, capitalism has brought desolation to the meat-packing district in Chicago through un-just laws, corruption, and the complete exploitation of immigrants trying to make it in America. Interestingly, the book missed it's mark on the public who were disgusted by the descriptions of the meat-packing plants. Instead of striking a direct blow against capitalism through reform, it struck an indirect blow against big-business because a precedence was set when the government clamped down on the food processing industry."
2,wut,when in the world did i get this i dont even know. ew i hate this book i tried numerous times to read it and its sad and all but upton isnt my main man i like faulkner more
4,Good,I finally purchased this book after reading how important it was to the establishment of the FDA. Kind of disappointed.
2,"Good, but to Much Detail",I thought this was an okay book. I would not call it a classic by any means. It has too much over written detail and I fell alseep every time I tried to read it. I would recommend it if you are into the pain and suffering of the 1800's.
4,Overall,"The Jungle was a powerful tale about an immigrating family with high hopes and dreams that come crashing down on them. Written at the turn of the century, this book tells the real truth. Upton Sinclair captures the truth about working in the meat packing factories called ""packingtown"" and what life at homes was like. The Rudkus family has high hopes of living in riches as they travel to America. When they arrive they realize America is anything but what they had dreamed. They try to survive from paycheck to paycheck, and when they do get paid they usually spend it quicker than the last trying to make a good life for themselves and their families. If something good happens you can only expect something bad to come up in their path. The socialist type of government is really brought out in this story too. It is hard to imagine this really did happen in America only about 100 years ago."
4,"The Jungle- Although gruesome, signifigant","Upton Sinclair's The Jungle was a rather gruesome, depressing and dreary book that seem to drag on and on. The morbid descriptions of the meat packing industry often made me cringe; however, when you consider the politcal and social implications that this book had on American society, it is worth another consideration. Although not pleasurable reading, this book still served as a rewarding reading experience for me. I recomend The Jungle because of its thematic implications and discussion of moral issues."
3,InTerEsTinG...but...technically....boRinG toOOoo...,"I find sinclair to be real redundant and descriptive. maybe a little too descriptive...to the point where i find myself nearly falling deep deep asleep. on the other hand, his main objective of the book really got throught to society. his books was a motivation for political action. and i find that worth the praise of anyone. but really, must it take 349pages to get the message through! consider the poor illirate teenagers who are forced to read this book. its a type of torment. but then again, thanks to sinclair, there was a reform to all this injustice. getting to da point, personally, i detest this book with my upmost passion...."
4,Shocking Look At The Realities of Packingtown,"This emotional story of Jurgis, a Lithuanian, who has come to America in search of the classic ""dream"" is very shocikng and horrifying. Sinclair harshly criticizes the exploitations of capitalism and leads the reader to think more carefully about positive aspects of socialism."
3,it is a treatise rather than a book,"the book is not bad but all the incredible things that happen to his main character are a little bit hard to swallow. also in the end the book becomes more a treatise about comunism than a novel, but it is no so bad after all. the author was trying to do two things at the same time, writing a novel and denouncing the atrocities committed by the capitalist. luis mendez"
4,"Sad story, wrong conclusion","Real tear jerker, and disgusting look at the lives of immigrants. Sad look at society's explotation of those they consider inferior. I just disagree with the author's way of fixing the problem."
4,A Classic,"This book was more than I expected. My history classes stress the fact that this book exposed the meatpacking industry and eventually led to the development of the FDA. In reading the book, I found the greater story was a man's struggle to keep his family afloat. This book, however, gets four stars because the last three chapters are pure socialist propaganda. Overall, I can see why it is a classic and would recommend it to other readers."
3,Very good detail but repititive,"Sinclair goes into excellent detail in The Jungle but the first 3/4's of the book are very repetitive. The book gets more interesting towards the end when Jurgis becomes politically involved, and graft and socialism come into the story. Good portrayal of socialism through a the eyes of a poor meat packer."
4,Excellent; just ignore the ending,"The Jungle is moving, powerful, and well-written. The one passage on page 95 (in my edition) which begins, ""For twenty-five years of Antanas Rudkus and his son and dwelt in the forest, and it was hard to part in this way.."", is enough to ensure the Jungle a permanent place on my shelf. This, despite an obviously politically motivated ending. If you are a capitalist like me, don't let the miguided Socialist tripe bother you; just ignore it, and read the rest of what is otherwise a most excellent work."
4,The Jungle of Lies,"I found this book to be very fascinating, indeed. Upton Sinclair does an excellent job of portraying the early 20th century lives for the immigrant family and I did enjoy the ideas of the author. His work leads is intended on leading the audience that the immigrants to the United States are clearly victims. As the book is intended to gain support against the meat packing industry and for the working class, the reader is inclined to believe that everyone was against these people. It is understood throughout this novel that many of these newcomers can hardly speak a word of English and that they don't really believe any real harm will come to them. This common conception was felt throughout the nation, however, the opposite happens. Working conditions, housing rent, and injuries are just some of the reasons the corruption is addressed in this book. The industry will never look the same to you."
4,A very good book but....,you can download this book for free on gutenberg.org which is a legitimate site. It will be great for people who own reading devices like kindle or just likes free stuff.
4,The adaptation versus the original,"Peter Kuper's adaptation of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle is not as intellectually stimualting as the original. However, it is an excellent version of the book that can be read by individuals at the middle and high school levels. To teach the lessons and history contained within Sinclair's 400+ page book would be too time-consuming for most school classrooms. With the stark, harsh illustrations and the narrative provided, the reader will still be able to understand the original story and appreciate the plot, no matter what format the book comes in."
4,Better than last time,"I read this book back in ninth grade for an English class because I had to. Something about it pulled me in, and made me remember it. Now, almost 20 years later, I bought and read it because I wanted to, and I'm glad. I got so much more out of it (even got to the end this time). This book will open your eyes to the way businesses in America were run, and how everyday folk are effected by them. A great read...now I'm passing it along to my best friends high school aged daughter."
5,Great Book,"It was kind of a dark book in that it seems like nothing goes right for Jurgis, but it keeps you captivated because you keep wanting something to go right for him so that he can obtain the American dream. One of my favorites."
5,A true reflection of American food industry and social movement,"This is so far my favorite book. Mr. Sinclair's articulation of the English language has made the book one of the jewels in the American literature history. He was a true investigative journalist, one of the heroes in modern journalism. Sometimes I would find myself very moved and even depressed because of the vivid and harsh social image he described in the book. This book has a great impact on my life. I stopped buying products produced by big companies who do not practice ethical business. I also strongly recommand reading ""Fast Food Nation"" (as a matter of fact, ""The Jungle"" was mentioned in ""Fast Food Nation"", and that's how I knew it.)"
2,"""Jungle"" has ups, downs; too long","Sinclair's ""The Jungle"" starts out interesting enough, describing a wedding feast of Lithuanian immigrants. The description of the meat factories and the working conditions therein are, although gruesome and disturbing, very moving. Most of the novel, however, drags along to an unsatifying conclusion that Sinclair uses, it would seem, to promote his own political agenda."
3,Informative and interesting but a little too long,"I had high hopes for this book, which let me down in the end. I love reading older books based on history for the understanding of an era and to learn more about the life of an immigrant in the early 20th century. For the most part, this book vividly showed me another view of America, however, the last 50 pages were so filled with Sinclair's political ideas that I just couldn't keep my interest up."
3,It Might Be a Classic But . . .,"This book started out ok and the first 3/4s of the book was pretty interesting. But once you get to the final 1/4, most of the characters are dead and Upton Sinclair is just going on and on about socialism. And by that time, the only thing you can say is ""Huh?"""
2,Unoriginal.,"A word to the wise -- after opening it, the CD stated that certain tracks have either been re-recorded, or are live versions (can't recall which ones). Both of which caused me to suffer convulsions and return it.True, those tracks may very well have been listenable, but I'd rather have the originals. As iTunes don't have any tracks yet, I'll keep looking for another compilation on Amazon."
3,"Cute, but nothing worth buying.","I bought my copy from one of the Used and New sellers, not Amazon and got it alot cheaper. As I watched it thought, it was not the kind of anime I was looking for. There is not any action and the peak of nudity is a few seconds of toplessness. The stories were amusing to a certain degree, though I have no desire to see them again. If you are into action or hentai you would do best to look elsewhere."
3,"So, take off your clothes!","The above line is what passes for ""seduction"" in the first part of this disc, and it's all downhill from there. However, it is well-animated and the voice actors certainly give it their all. There are also some pretty good Special Features, but not enough to make it worth buying; you are better off renting this movie through Netflix. My rating: 7/10."
2,"It's a man's world, HA HA women have no power!",Their is no graphic hardcore sex in this video what a rip-off. The only thing that I do like in this video is men can finally get what they want in a corruption ruled by men. Women have to obay.
2,Anna doesn't really learn to share,"My daughters (2yr and 3yrs) LOVE Anna's Book (so do I), so when I saw there was another Anna book, I bought it. I was so dissappointed. Anna has a friend over, doesn't share her cookies even after her mom gets involved, so the friend goes home. Anna then ""shares"" with her two stuffed animals by putting cookies on all the plates. But then at the end, Anna eats all the cookies (so she never really shared or learned to share, at all)!!!"
5,5 years later I still love this computer,"Have since upgraded the Ram, power supply, graphics card, sound card and a 2.1 speaker system for gaming, totaling $300 and I can play most xbox 360 games on it. Perfect computer for learning to upgrade cheap and still stay ahead of brand new computers."
4,Pheonix from the Ashes,"The book has some wonderful stories, and helps put life in perspective when you realize the challenges that other souls have been confronted with, and have overcome. I understand when ""life happens to you,"" how devastating that can be... The only qualm I have with this book is that the author justifies the wrongs she had full control over (infidelity) in her own life by saying she needed the experience in order to grow. The cost was the trust her family had in her. I think the true challenge in her life was to REJECT the offer, no matter how unbelievably attractive, because of integrity and love for those who trusted her. That's the test. A criminal's high may not be achieved any other way than by committing the crime - but where has the respect gone for doing the right thing even though the wrong makes you ""feel more alive""?"
4,Decent,"Enough reviews have been written of this book, so I will just add my bit by saying that she started off the book very well, but progressively bored me as I read more and more. I would recommend reading this one up to where she goes on and on about her kids and then stop reading there--I think it was part 3. The book did not really inspire me or open my mind up in any way, but it wasn't bad. Not essential reading in my opinion."
4,Broken Open and the Phoenix Process,I read this book for school and wasn't sure I would enjoy it. I was surprised to find out that I really did like to read the book and couldn't put it down when I started. It is a good read and self-help book for anyone struggling with baggage from their past reading stories from others who have been there and are surviving and sometimes came back to a new life.
5,inspiring,great self help book that can b read over and over again . truly inspiring..would recomend this book highly .
3,Review by Linda,"Barbara Lesser speaks from personal experiences and from the experiences of friends and colleagues about events that have prompted her and others on their journeys in personal growth. She describes this growth process as the 'Phoenix Process,' but the power of the Phoenix as known in mythology is not reflected in her description of this process. She is unable to thread the theme of the Phoenix sufficiently throughout the book. Further the title of the book, ""Broken Open"" does not reflect the metaphor of the Phoenix (ashes) that she attempts to make central to the book. Overall the book is well written and well organized. The beginning of the book (first 1/3) is very engaging but towards the middle of the book, it slows down and is hard to plow through. It picks up again in the last third of the book. All in all it is worth the read, but would only make in the bottom third of my list of spiritual books to read."
2,Disappointed,"If you are purchasing this book to help you through a VERY difficult time, do not bother. It has alot of fluff. It is great for those everyday trying events, but does not hit the mark for an earthshaking event in your life, when you truly ARE broken open."
3,Underwhelmed,"She makes a good case for pursuing the path of self-awareness, but for those of us already on it, this book is too elementary. Best for beginners on the path to looking inward."
5,Life is ok,"I am enjoying this book, it gives you permission to feel negative things that happen in your life but helps you to process them and move on, sometimes life is tough and not fair, acknowledge it and don't let it be the elephant in the room, acknowledge and move on. This book help guide you through that."
4,The Phoenix Process,"""Broken Open"" was recomended to me by a friend who had gone thru a hardexperience in his life. I haven't been too lucky myself, so this bookwas an eye-opener as to how you can grow (and do) when you get stoppedin your tracks by sickness, death and accidents.The Phoenix Process was a wonderful experience and the help she givesto learn you meditate is an everyday tool.I liked to book very much and highly recomend it to any seeker."
5,Deep and beautifully written,"A penetrating, exquisitely written exploration of the broken places in each of us, through the lens of the author's life -- with mind-blowing reframes that put you on the road of hope and growth. Stellar!"
5,My divorce life-saver!,"I read A LOT of books when I was going through my divorce four years ago but none of them spoke to me the way this book did. It truly did help me to see that this change I was going through didn't have to be all negative and through her writing, I learned how to see the beauty in this otherwise painful process. I found it so helpful that I read it twice!"
5,My most expansiva reading,"Youre book is clearly a true learning process of your Shadow side and your Higher Self. It amazed me of how many inetersting people have crossed your path, and I bought every book you mentioned. It has Been my most expensive reading ever. Amazon must be thrilled. CONGRATULATIONS! Perla Barabak, México City."
5,Amazing!,"This book helped me so much during a really rough period of my life. I had it close always, so I could refer to it like a Bible and read certain sentences again. I love it so much I went and bought it for a friend of mine who is struggling right now. I could not think of a better gift."
5,Simply Amazing...,"With Broken Open, Elizabeth Lesser has written a book that is more than capable of changing ones outlook on life. She explores the ways we can use the hardships we face in life to become better people. Through her own ""breaking open"" story and the true stories of others, she masterfully weaves a web of spiritual and emotional wisdom, showing how times of pain and strife can awaken us to new ways of living more meaningful lives. I'll never look at an emotional problem the same way again. The imagery that Elizabeth Lesser creates in this majestic work of literature is some of the best I have ever experienced. Not only is Broken Open emotionally educational, it is also interesting and entertaining. From the first chapter, you will be drawn into this book, only to emerge later on with a completely different outlook on the pain and strife of your daily life. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in having a more meaningful life, and anyone who likes to read amazing stories."
3,"Not Self Help, Self Absorbed","I may have misunderstood the book description when I purchased it but I was looking for more of a self help book with specific suggestions and advice on how to get through difficult times in your life. Lesser's book is more of a self absorbed memoir than a self help book. She continually uses the term ""Phoenix Process"" without explaining how a person goes through it. Lots of new age name dropping and stories about her oh-so-amazing life but no solid advice."
4,Broken Open: How Difficult times Can Help Us Grow,Really good book. Helped me to understand how I can use this bad time in my life to grow and become stronger and more confident.
3,Interesting new perspective,"This book does offer interesting information about how the Manson Family traveled through and lived in the desert areas. It also contains some great information about how law enforcement viewed the Family at the time. However, the reader gets tired of the writing style and repetitive nature of the narrative. If you are interested in the Manson case, you should have this piece in your collection simply because of the unique look at this period in the evolution of the Manson Family."
2,Not much knew.,"The desert was a place Manson loved. His desperate family followed him there where natures fury seemed to squeeze the life out of them until they were captured. Nothing new, but nice descriptions of life in the desert..I found much more insight into the Manson Family in ""Squeaky,"" and ""Taming the Beast."""
2,Coming down fast,"Not the most riveting book out there about the Manson clan, with large sections of the text lifted virtually verbatim from ""Helter Skelter"".Murphys' original material is also fairly unenlightening . For interesting new information on the subject read Jess Bravins' sensitive biography of Lynette Fromme, ""Squeaky""."
4,Good product,"Great product, folks that know CRG know that they are well designed. I have seen other CRG mirrors fade from the sun after a while, but hasn't personally happened to me yet. I remember shipping was a little delayed, but it wasn't prime-eligible so I knew it was to be expected. Good price on Amazon for this product."
1,"This is someone's college paper, not an actual collection of ghost stories","I was very disappointed. There were no genuine ghost stories. It was all secondary references to historical sources that referred to ghosts, and the conclusions the author drew from these references. It was extremely dry. Skip, I tell you, SKIP!"
5,Exactly what I expected!!!!,It feels good and it looks real. Just like a real gun. Just like what they promise I was going to get thats exactly what i got. thanks
1,THE Best Band out of Knoxville....,"I have to disagree with you, there....Hard Knox, was nothing compared to the Knoxville band, SAGE....Hard Knox was a band I remember coming to perform at my high school auditorium....SAGE was a band I saw performing as the opening act for Bon Jovi, Bad Company, Steppenwolf, The Four Horseman, and Peter Frampton....THE best band out of Knoxville during the 80's and 90's was SAGE. Hard Knox couldn't even compare.........."
2,TWO STARS,"T-shirt quality was not very nice. When I washed it, it looked like it had been used. Pricey for the quality."
1,War and the Red Cross a disappointment,"This brief, poorly written, 180 page monograph is hardly an indepth analysis of the ICRC role in the post-Cold War era. I expected a little more detail and a little more scholarship. I do not recommend it."
1,worthless,i only gave this book one star because it you have to.this is the most retarded book ive seen.its just some retards who threw some vietnam era cloths on and took picture in a studio.no real use for this book i could have done the same thing in my back yard. dont waste your money.
5,attends briefs,This product is great and I will definitely buy again. The company that sent them was excellent and I go them quicker than when I was supposed to which is a plus for me.
4,"Drama, not action","For those of you looking for superhero battles and action scenes, this is not the movie for you. The Pilot episode for the 70's Incredible Hulk series was a drama about a man, David Banner, driven by his past.The Hulk is the result. This touching story gives us great insite into the character of the Hulk and of Banner himself, but without the action so common in other comic adaptations. The Hulk is neither hero nor villain, he is a victim."
3,Interesting tidbits,"If you find reading dictionaries, reference books or history books fascinating, you may like this little book. It truly is interesting to me how much the English language owes to the realm of religious writing. In all fairness, interesting not fascinating, hence the rating.The text does not read like a dictionary so it isn't too hard to comprehend and most readers will polish this off in a couple weeks even at a liesurely pace. However, I would classify this book as a reference book since that may be where you find the most use for it and not something you just sit down and read, unless you are a trivia buff of sorts."
5,Tremenouse Reference,"I first checked Coined by God out of the library. However, I quickly realized what an awesome reference it was, both for bible scholars and for wordsmiths as well. Not content to simply peruse the library's copy over and over again, I decided to purchase my own so that I could spend more time with the words and phrases of our language that had their origins with the bible. Also, I wanted it as a reference book as well!"
1,waste of money,"we bought this last year with the replacement cartridges from home depot, we tried this from May-September with no luck, looks nice but no matter where we placed it in our 1/2 acre yard, the pouch was always empty. we'll try again this year since we still have cartridges left but to us it's a complete waste of the $99.00 plus extra cartridges that we spent."
1,Mosquitos Rejoice!,"This product absolutley does not work at all. I placed the unit as recommended in an area where mosquitos were in my yard. The mosquitos were visible in the area. After running the unit 3 days - non stop - there were not any mosquitos in the catch net.The company was fair and took the product back with a full refund. But the product did not work as advertised.Mosquitos will be happy if home owners purchase this unit - but the home owners should beware!Lentek MK-05 ""Champion"" Mosquito Repeller REDUCED $50"
3,it's ok,"i purchased this thinking i'd have a bad mosquito problem...I don't, and haven't even used it..and probably won't use it at all....kind of disappointed. but oh well"
5,Understand What's Happening In Emerging Markets,"This is a MUST READ for institutional investors worldwide! For the first time I have a confident sense of what is at the core of emerging market instability. Now if only some government policy makers would read this (even they would understand it!), the causal conditions might start to improve."
5,"""Oh"" yes!","This single is a must-own. This woman is an artistic genius. If you don't like Ciara, then you're a racist. Plain and simple."
3,Great Book but cover is torn apart,"The book is great, with superb content, hats off to Aaron Shearer the authorTo the Amazon Team:Please don't ship books with splits and cuts on the cover, your packing style was great, there's no doubt about it, the kind suggestions which I have is:Please focus on ""Perceived Quality"", not all customers like to return back received items, people order online to save time and money, not for wasting time in returning back items, but situations like this should not turn out to be a leverage for any organizationThere should be an ultimate customer satisfaction factor built in to the organization, e.g. considering the present case: ""reduction in the number of unfilled stars, those originating because of system discrepancies which could have been controlled""5 bright stars for the book5 dull stars for the cuts and splitsAverages out to three stars"
3,Tinkerbelle's learn hip-hop,I bought this for my daughter. She liked the dvd but the picture qualith is terrible. The lighting is too bright and the girls are wearing white so they get washed out of the picture. But it is a good excercise video for young girls.
4,My granddaughter loved it!,My granddaughter loves to dance and she watches this dvd quite often. She has learned some of the cutest dances by watching this dvd.
2,Did T-Bone lose his masters?,"Not bloody likely! He's done more work as a producer than he has as a recording artist. Yet here he butchers his own songs!These rerecordings sound like they've been filtered through gauze. The instrumentals are muddied by heavy reverb, and they bury the vocals in many instances. Everything just seems off-kilter and out of balance.What earthly reason could be motivating his refusal to rerelease ""Proof Through the Night"" and ""Trap Door""? Perhaps he's waiting for most of us to tire of waiting and buy this mangled mishmash instead.I say: No thanks!"
5,Should get wider acclaim,"T-Bone presents some unique views of the world. All of his songs make great lyrical points, and they musically outstanding."
3,"Pleased he's back, but it could've been better","When I first heard that this compilation was coming out, I was thrilled. For years I had longed for Trap Door, Truth Decay, and Proof Through the Night to be released on CD. Forty songs? That should take in a great deal of each. Then I saw the list, and was a bit disappointed. It's a tough job, these anthologies, and coming up with what belongs can be difficult. Just look at some of the questionable selections on Bob's Volume III, or Van's Volume II. As I scanned the songs, the glaring omissions quickly jumped out. I had to take a second look - did I miss Hold On Tight, Ridiculous Man, Poetry, Baby Fall Down, The Sixties, and a few others? No, but T-Bone, or someone else, did. At least half the cuts included don't measure up to these. Apart from a few bizarre elements, it's an interesting and largely entertaining collection, but man, it could've been a whole lot better."
3,"Bait and switch on ""Proof"" Tracks","Was excited to buy this collection of music I already had just to get at least PART of ""Proof through the Night"" on legit CD. (I made a personal CD from my vinyl copy a while back, but it has noise and pops.) Instead of the original tracks, they have been re-recorded and some even revised -- ""deals a little scorn"" indeed. So much of ""Proof"" was an indictment of the movie biz and how it creates false dreams, kills imagination and ruins lives -- I wonder if these rewritings are an attempt to not bite the hand that currently feeds him so well. T Bone, I believe that you are now a ""Hula Hoop.""Instead of this, buy ""Truth Decay"" and ""T Bone Burnett"" (the Dot album) and find a vinyl copy of ""Proof."""
1,"Ridiculous, Man","It is heartbreaking to hear that T-Bone Burnett does not want to release the unedited versions of ""Proof Through The Night"" & ""Trap Door"" on CD.These are two of the best albums of all time.The Re-Recorded ""Proof Through The Night"" tracks are a crime.Ridiculous.Edited Update 4/10/07T-Bone will be releasing ""Proof Through The Night/Trap Door/Behind Trap Door"" through Rhino Handmade.All is good again."
4,No Proof,"Can only echo the sentiments of others listed here. The remixes/omissions sort of boggle. I listened to the Proof Through The Night LP while waiting for this cd, now I know why the Limewires of the world are worthy of the occasional download. You've got me ""stunned"""
3,"Yes its good, but.......","Not many people know this, but ""Proof through the night"" was Rolling Stones critics album of the year in 83 or 84, I cant remember. If there ever was an album that should have been made into a CD it was that one. The alternate versions on Twenty twenty just dont make it.There was a song called ""The Sixties"" that was T-Bones best story telling with Pete Townsend that to this day still tears me to the core. It's sad to see it missing.Where the hell is ""The killer moon"" from Talking Animals? T-Bone must not have control of the masters. That's the only possible reason I could think of. Too bad, this collection had great potential."
1,T-Bone Is A Bone-Head!,"I agree wholeheartedly with the T. Davis review. This is one of the worst compilations I've ever bought. What a shame, because I truly enjoy T Bone's music. The sound quality is horrible and to add insult to injury the ""New"" versions are simply God Awful!"
3,"Only half of ""Trap Door""","OK, I can't review this compilation, I just ordered it but am familiar with most of the material on it. But like one of the previous reviewers, I have to ask: why only half of ""Trap Door,"" an EP I used to have on vinyl that I've been seeking on CD for ages? I can't imaging what possessed T-Bone to withhold the other three songs. The whole EP was perfect, great songs, beautifully recorded."
3,"Some heavy tracks, ,more boring tracks, POOR mixing!","Ok firstly I absolutely love Dom & Roland from a production standpoint. Top notch producer, in my opinion ""Cant punish me"" & ""Soundwall"" are two of the heaviest amen laden tracks ever produced. Unfortunately this ""MIX"" cd does not highlight these, or any other tracks with any interesting mixes...very lack luster skill on the decks. For example I knew I was in trouble when there was a literal train wreck when mixing out of the very first track! Unacceptable!!"
1,Book Needs To Be Proofread.,"While the book does a good job on teaching basic Database concepts and provides excellent examples to fortify your learning, there is one big problem.The book is one gigantic error. The sample problems and exercises are missing code and syntax making exercises very hard to follow and having the reader fill in the missing pieces for the examples to be correct and consistent.For someone new to database, this book will prove to be a big mess of confusion since consistency and order are missing with the hands-on work.This book should go back to the publisher or author and be proofread and have all the sample problems, exercises and hands-on work verified to work because I can guarantee that half of them will not if copied from this text."
4,Works as it should; good alternative to Sony brand,"I bought this for my wife so we could copy the important data -- such as pictures and whatnot -- from her cell phone to my computer, and this did what it was intended to do. I wouldn't rate the build quality incredibly high, but it's not low quality/cheap either. For the price I paid (less than $5 shipped), you really can't complain unless the wires were frayed and the thing didn't work -- neither of which were the case. I would definitely recommend this."
4,It does what it should do,"Light, transfers fast, and price less than half of from at&t store. It can even be used to install language pack and applications on my Z520 using the right software. The only thing I feel sorry is it cannot be used to unlock the cellphone."
5,Exactly what I expected,I received the real Sony Ericsson cable and not some cheap OEM version. Cable quality is excellent and it works perfectly. It even charges my cell phone (W300i).
1,disappointing,"I ordered this item to help me upload pictures from my phone to my computer. I chose this route as a last resort when I realized that I could not transfer my photos any other way. I was very disappointed to find out that this item should have a cd with it and that because it had no cd, I could do nothing with it. Fortunately, I did not spend much money on this item."
5,Marvelous,"808State has been one of the first band to make real electronic music in late 80's in Manchester.Their sound is unique, you won't find another group making similar music and every track is different. They are good enough to make hardcore, trance, techno-jazz, house and on a live stage they are brilliant. So this album is one of the best. Just listen to Magical Dream and you'll understand why !"
5,LOVE IT !,ALWAYS have loved the real mcoys :) so happy I found season sets will definitely buy more in the future
5,I am really enjoying these,"The first season is pretty good, but this show got better with seasons two and three. This show is as good as you remember. If you are too young to remember it, you have something to look forward to. Good, clean fun. I am so glad that these are available. If you like this, I would also recommend the Ma and Pa Kettle movies."
5,a family friendly video,"While we have not viewed the ""Real McCoys"" season 2, we are very happy with season one which is as big part of why we came back for season two. For the most part, they are very family friendly---(Walter Brennen (sp)) says some things I wish he didn't but for the most part, they are very good films. I never saw them on TV the first time around, but in our search for things that are ""light"" and not objectionable, these have been fine.Bob Wilson, Michigan"
5,The Real McCoys,"Service was excellent as usual, product came when told it would and the DVD is in great condition. 5 stars"
2,The second season set.,"The show was one of the elderly parent's favorite from 1960s USA television. I bought one collection each, of the first three seasons. The vendor (supplier to Amazon) for the DVD collections used cheap plastic cases for the DVDs, in which the plastic center post clips inside used to hold the DVD in place in the case, were so thin and brittle they broke almost immediately, requiring I buy new generic DVD cases from the local Radio Shack. Pretty poor quality materials used."
1,A very high likelihood these episodes will be incomplete,"The Inception Media Group released the first season of this classic series as incomplete episodes which were missing 3 and-a-half minutes per episode. This second season will also be released by the Inception Media Group so there is a high likelihood these episodes might seem similarly incoherent because they will also be missing 3 and-a-half minutes per episode.If you are a casual viewer, you might not mind this, but I wanted to at least make this information available to customers so that they could make up their own minds."
4,Interesting,"When an earthquake crumbles a school building trapping three unfriends together, Miracles abound. While trapped under rubble three people are drawn together for comfort and support. Each sustains an injury, still they rejoice when they realize they will be rescued. Over night the three are Healed and God blesses them with gifts that they don't appreciate at first. Written for the young adult set, ""The Gifted"" is well crafted and timely. Blackstock presents her readers with writing that provokes thought long after the book is finished.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge"
2,Very disappointing...,"This short novel just doesn't work, in my opinion. The character development is sorely lacking, and the plot is predictable and kind of hokey. Blackstock has also written a similar book for teens, called ""The Gifted Sophomores"".I was expecting better from Terri Blackstock. I absolutely loved her book ""The Covenant Child"" and I highly recommend it (see my review of that book for more info).Perhaps the short novel isn't something that every good author can pull off. If you're interested in an excellent short novel, check out ""A Choice to Cherish"" by Alan Maki, ""The Touch"" by Patricia Hickman, or ""Lullaby"" by Jane Orcutt.You might want to check out my other reviews of Christian books and music."
3,Fun Read Showing How Christians Should Work Together,"""Gifted"" by Terri Blackstock is a quick Christian fiction read which shows how Christians should work together to meet needs of others and introduce them to Jesus. When Andy, Carl and Bree were discouraged that they were the only ones who showed up for their Bible Study after work in an effort to reach their co-workers with the gospel, a tornado hit and they were crushed under the rubble. God answered their prayers and their lives were changed once they experienced God's power.Although a bit corny, this book challenges Christians to use the gifts God has given them to serve Him by serving others and meeting their needs. It is a fun read because each of the main characters are endowed with supernatural powers which makes for a good read but isn't very believable."
5,"Pictures, Drama, Humor, and History","I really loved this book. Annie Brassey writes very precisely and with a lot of humor. I would have enjoyed more info on her family but that is just quibbling.... There are more journals she wrote about their other travels. I wish all of them were available on Kindle but they aren't, so I will have to buy those books from Amazon. But this lady has stories to tell about their travels and adventures that are interesting, enlightening, and great fun to read!"
4,Very satisfied,I decided to get new flatware since I had several pieces missing but I did not have a lot of money to spend. I found this set and it looked nice and the price was very affordable so I went for it. I do notice that my purchase price was much less than it is now however I am very pleased with the looks and the upkeep is no problem. They look like new with just a swipe with a paper towel to remove whatever few water spots are on them after drying. There were two pieces that had a tiny nick on the handle but they aren't all that noticable and cause no problem for me. I would recommend this item for anyone needing an affordable set of flatware.
5,Unbelievable value,"It's 100% accurate to the original (perfect match to the other side) and functions perfectly. Wasn't too bad to install either, though more work than I would have liked. Hey, it's a car, they don't build them to be easy. Would definitely recommend this to others and go this route again."
5,My Favorite James Baldwin Book,"I was given this book in my early 20s by a friend, I didn't understand the change and influence Baldwin would bring to my life. This book is ideal for anyone who has ever felt like they didn't belong in a group, a time or a place. Another Country is incredibly well written and deeply sad.Another Country will take you back to the Harlem Renaissance, you don't just read the story but you hear the music that played. So much of this book deals with identity and the shifting influences in African and American culture.I highly recommend."
4,Sonny's Blues Part 2,"I agree very much with other reviewers that the first third of this book is inspired and very strongly written. The story really seems to begin and end with Rufus a jazz drummer and his girlfriend Leona. Perhaps Baldwin felt he had to write another 200 pages to make a commercial novel. After all writers didn't all have mfa teaching jobs in 1962. In any case the natural ending appears to be much earlier than the actual ending. In a lot of ways Rufus' story is a long short story kind of like Sonny's Blues which was also influenced by jazz in New York City. Perhaps Baldwin could have found a way to prolong Rufus and Leona's story for a few more pages. Oops, shouldn't have said that. I really don't want to see a sequel to this book with zombies, werewolves, or vampires..."
2,noble failure,"Baldwin wrote wonderful, perceptive essays, but he lacked the imaginative power to write great novels.This is a very mediocre existential screed, about a young writer, Vivaldo, and his circle of friends. Vivaldo is a blocked writer, and has the weight of sadness on him with a black friend - the soul of the novel and of course a jazz musician - who killed himself. Only he faces his fears, as did some of his friends, does he un-block himself. THe end. It has been done elsewhere, and better at that. Baldwin meant well, but the story is rather flaccid.Not recommended."
1,Disgusting and Repulsive!,"I was very repulsed by this book! I did not like the way that it glorified homosexuality and made it sound like it was alright! If I had not been forced to read it for a Literature class, I would have put it down somewhere around the 2nd chapter. The book started out with an interesting plot with exciting characters, but by the beginning of the 2nd chapter it began to go down hill. I would never recommend this book to anyone to read. It is a waste of time and is by no means a book that challenges the mind. It only pollutes the mind!"
4,Compelling look at racism &the struggle for self knowledge,"An epic of a novel, Another Country really is two novels in one: the first is the story of Rufus Scott, a black man living in the segregated world of NYC in the 50's, struggling to find a way out of the mire of alienation and self-hatred, while the second is a portrait of the people who are left behind after Rufus exits the stage. The first part is gripping and beautifully realized, while the second is a much more pedestrian look at a collection of confused, tormented folks scanning the streets of Manhattan as well as each other's beds in search of meaning. Baldwin is an amazingly original and insightful writer, yet the novel feels anticlimactic after the first section narrated by Rufus, and the conclusion seems too pat. Still, for its discussion of issues of race, class, homosexuality, adultery, and the struggle for self-knowledge, Another Country, published in 1962, was far ahead of its time."
4,Another Country,"I just finished reading Another Country. This book should be required reading for Jr. High or High School students. I was born in 1970 and didn't witness the civil rights movement. Many of my generation feel that racism is not a serious issue anymore. Though this book was written before I was born, some of the same thoughts and ideaology mentioned are still prevalent today. As an African American man, I know that racism still excist today as it did in the 60's. With Blacks, at times, as the perpetrators. This was the case with Ida. A black woman in a relationship with a white man. She new that this man loved her. She loved him, but the racial hatred that she had been exposed to in her life prevented her from seeing anything other than the color of Vilvado's skin.Baldwin was certainly ahead of his time and Another Country is just as timely today as it was in the 60's and 70's."
3,Fun but not durable.,"The dartboard is fun but not durable. The dart shafts broke quickly and needed to be replaced. The electronic scoring display cracked when a dart hit it, it still scores but is cracked. All of these problems surfaced in the first hours of use. On a positive note, there are a lot of different games to play and the heckler is hillarious."
5,Very Entertaining,"Got this for my 8 year old son! He loves playing with the Computer opponent. The Heckler is hilarious, but after a while gets boring. Like the other reviewer described the plastic shafts broke. Had them replaced with metal shaft and it works like a charm."
5,More then just baseball,"Im 17 years old and hardly pick up a book , but I couldnt seem to put this one down , I find myself reading this book 3 hours a day. These are all articles of Ted Williams life that go in order from when he was a young kid to a old man. Its not just about his baseball side , but also about his love of fishing and who he really is behind the baseball image. It doesnt just tell you that he did something but how he did it ( dislike fans , visited kids in hospital , hate writers , sent money to his father even know he hadnt seen him in over 10 years , and why he was so generous to others ). Ive read alot about Ted Williams but I learned alot more about him in this book. I highly reccomend this book to anyone whos interested in "" The Kid """
1,IMPACT INNOVATIONS does NOT include or even sell Replacemnt Bulbs for their products! BEWARE!,"I've purchased various seasonal products, many made by Impact Innovations, this Shamrock already has 4 bulbs out/dead. They do not offer replacement bulbs!!"
4,Pounds Of Bass! The height of her queendom!,"This album is so good. I was listening to it while on the freeway and it was knockin'! I love the bass on this album. My favorites are ""Princess Of The Posse"", ""Come Into My House"" and ""Wrath Of My Madness"" has to be one of the best (Hip-Hop) party songs of all time!"
4,The Reign begins,"Queen Latifah made a major impression on hip-hop with All Hail The Queen. She draws upon a wide variety of black and mainstream music, including jazz, reggae, house, soul and dance, and has the versatility and talent to shine in whatever genre she ventures into. She hits a musical G-spot with ""Come Into My House,"" and ""Ladies First."" Nearly as strong are ""Dance For Me,"" ""Wrath of My Madness,"" and ""Evil That Men Do,"" a straight hip-hop number addressing socio-economic ills. What keeps the album from being a true classic are the small but annoying handful of poor quality tracks, such as ""Mama Gave Birth To The Soul Children,"" and ""The Pros."" Still, this is a strong and auspicious debut."
5,SHE started it!,"Well, not alone, but the Queen was one of the pioneer women of East Coast rap, and she shines here like the diva she is. ""Wrath of My Madness"" explains it all, and ""Queen of Royal Badness"" shows why mere series TV could NOT contain her mad rhyme flow! Go Queen GO!"
5,I Love This Alubm She Has The Fattes beats,"I want to meet the Queen oneday . She is a powerful,strong black women"
5,"Fantastic, fulfills a large void in Oracle Documentation","Written much like the math textbooks of your youth (complete with exercises at the end of each section), Oracle Web Application Programming for Pl/SQL Developers is a godsend for those of us who knew you could write web apps using PL/SQL, but lacked the actual syntax to do so. Book can be used as either a reference or a tutorial guide, given that it is both comprehensive and chock full of sample code. Companion website is handy so you can copy and paste. Bottom line, if you want your browser to talk to your database and make it do neat tricks, this book will serve you well."
5,A Very Helpful Book,"I found this book very helpful as it explains the basics in a very clear, easy to understand language and has lots of examples. It's a high quality interactive manual: first the concepts are described, then I was presented with exercises, which is very good as most of us learn through practice, experince. The answers and clarifications which are given after the exercises unit helped me monitor my understanding and in the end I had the complete application and a great feeling of achievement."
4,Very informative companion book,"I was a brand new dyer when I got this book. It's full of great information, and has lots of math and precise measurements for all types of dyeing. As a beginner, I was a little overwhelmed by the amount of information, and didn't really need 2/3 of what was in it. But now that I'm a little more advanced, I really appreciate the different sections on different types of dye and how they react differently. There is a great section on color in the back, as well as conversion charts that I use ALL the time. It really is a companion book, and not one to teach in detail about one particular dye method, but great to have for quick reference."
5,Happy Fish Home,We had looked everywhere for this particular fish tank and were very pleased to find it on Amazon for such a reasonable price. It was delivered promptly.
5,Great!!,"We got this set for Christmas and love them. Looked at the high price stuff, which we own some of, but thought why not try this one. It cooks better than my expensive pans!! In the oven and stove top have been great. The handles stay cool on the stove top as promised, a really good deal for the amount and size of pans you get. We would buy them again in a second-"
2,JR,"Good,but handles and lids get really hot when cooking. Use towels or hand mits. Starting to see scratches here and there but we use them every day. We do not put them in the dishwasher at all only a little soap and hot water. Should last another few years...I hope"
5,Cooks Evenly,"This set was a great buy. It cooks evenly and cleans easily.The sizes are perfect.The only drawback is that the metal handles get rather hot...but, pot holders are an easy fix."
4,don't let people tell you thies speakers arn't good,"I looked around for months before I got these speakers. and I have to say that I am glad I did.pros- sound is not the best but great for the price.center speaker mounts on LCD monitor, witch is wonderful.sub really kicks. my windows are raddelling as I type.whirred remote is a nice touch. nice when you wanna mute them really quick encase of phone call.Cons- back speaker cords are not long enough. but just go to best buy and get some RCA exstenchans and you can make linkthin up the cords alot. no biggy.a little bit of sound loss when lots of bass.all in all great speakers. don't get down about them when you read other reviews. for the home/appartment user they are just what you need.and one more thing.. even though I had a surround sound card I had to go and get a program that maxemises the surround sound experience. it's call SRS labs. $19"
4,music sounds better w it!,"used it on my computer for a while but then decided to try it on my laptop and it worked marvels! i use it on my tv now and its like a perfect stereo system. i have it plugged all over my bedroom and it sounds amazing. worth the money, i think its perfect if u want to have a party without waking up all your neighbors."
1,Can be bought at Wal-Mart for cheaper,This item is being sold at an unreasonable price and can be purchased at Wal-Mart for 77$ I myself have choosen to buy mine at Wal-Mart over this
2,No Sound from subwoofer,"After 1 year that I bought this sound system from here in Amazon, Suddenly the Sub-woofer lost total sound, all cables are connected same as before, not changes on the operating system, just went completely silence on me.What a bummer, I get only sound from the satellite speakers. not quite the same.grrrrrrrrr"
5,WOW,"I bought these speakers because all the other speakers (regular desktop speakers) had been broken one way or the other (and it just so happened the one to break was always the main speaker). I put in the order and received my package in 2 days!! This is amazing to me, especially since the scheduled delivery date was june 2nd to june 5th (i received them on may 31st). BUY Now is a great company and these speakers are great. of course my laptop doesnt support 5.1 surround sound so i now have to buy an adapter (not a prob with me) but the 2 speaker (out of 5) that do work, sound amazing. I can only imagine how they're going to sound when all 5 do work!! And you can trust me on how loud these speakers are, seeing as I love to blast my music (i even was asked to turn down my iPod on the bus because they were too loud for a person seating in the back of the buds; where i was in the front!). Great buy for so cheap!!"
4,Excellent Speakers!!,"Bought these because I was tired of my factory speakers pings and tweaks, and the difference is AMAZING. If youre into gaming, movies or mp3s these are a must. Although, I did end up having to upgrade my sound card to get the full effect and range of the speakers it was well worth it. Also this is a full $30 cheaper than Bestbuy or Circut City. Get these speakers and listen to what youve been missing."
3,"Good, but there are better",I replaced some 2.1 Creative Itrigue 3200s with this system. Benefit - 5.1 surround sound from Logitech works well. Loss - Sound quality. The Itrigues are much better sounding system.But - I'm satisfied with what i got for the price.
5,A Wonderful Birthday Present!,"For my birthday, my wife took me shopping and allowed me to peruse CompUSA, Best Buy, and Wal-Mart. We saw these exact same speakers at Wal-Mart and Best Buy selling for approximately $80 to $90 before tax. In the end, my wife bought me a new Game Boy Advance that I picked out. At home, on a whim, I decided to check Amazon.com for Logitech speakers. Even after shipping, these speakers were $20 cheaper!The shipping on these were super-fast! I ordered them on a Saturday night and they were here by Tuesday!Like my fellow Michigan reviewer, I used music (Korn's ""Coming Undone"", Rihanna's ""SOS"", and Godsmack's ""I Stand Alone"") and video games (Bethesda's ""The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion) to test these speakers. While I know far less about speakers, I know that these sounded wonderful. Also, my speakers came with an adapter/converter to plug in DVD players and Video Game systems.For the price, these are an awesome deal!"
2,Poping sound annoying,"These speakers has a well known flaw and confirmed on Logitech support center which poping all time, and yes I have this issue, I've tried too many speakers from logitech and other brands and never experienced similar issue like that, you don't how annoying are they. I wouldn't get them if I knew about this issue.well, for sound quality I think its pretty cool with good base level but I don't know why base controller are behind sub woofer, you know you may put them in under table or some way far away from you.Design of speakers looks great and they are easy to install on wall."
3,Refresher only,"This product would be primarily useful for someone who already knows spoken Hebrew but wants to listen to various phrases, say, in a car while travelling, to help refresh themselves on the language. It is not suitable in my opinion for someone trying to learn the language. For someone trying to learn the language I recommend taking 1 year of Biblical Hebrew at a local seminary and then buying Rosetta Stone."
4,Buy it for The Spindle,"This DM's screen features the excellent expanded rules from the D&D Masters Set. There are tables governing the combat, clerical turning, saving throws, spellcasting, and more. Also featured is an excellent mini-adventure, The Spindle, which sets the high-level heroes on the path to immortality."
3,Hummel deserves better,"The Fantasie for piano in E flat major, Op. 18 is by far the most interresting piece on this cd. The rest is good but rather prosaic. Op 18 shows what potential Hummel had. I've heard Beethoven was inspired by this piece when he wrote some of his own piano music. Madoka Inui is a good pianist but here she downplays the drama in the music and the result isn't very convincing. This is a visionary and outstanding piece of music that deserves much better interpretations. This should be a standard piece in the repertoar of great pianists."
1,Only For Curio Hunters.,"Unless you are a curio hunter, who likes collecting voices from the past, you will not find much to enjoy in this set. Indeed, you might find much that will excruciate. Conductor Arthur Nikisch and soprano Elena Gerhardt were musicians of great renown in their day, but their 1911 performance of ""An die Musik"" is frankly appalling. Nikisch plays the opening accompaniment quickly, then slows to half speed when Gerhardt enters. What follows, for nearly four minutes, is not so much a tribute to music as a travesty of it. Altogether there is little offered by the early 20th Century generation of singers that I should like young singers of today to hear. Things improve when the 1930s are reached in this survey, especially when the accompanist Gerald Moore appears, but most of these later items can be found in other CD recitals and anthologies. Only curio hunters need to add this to their trolley."
4,Great planting begins with great planning!,"Wonderful thought pattern- not many pictures, and no scratch an sniff- but the information covered is great!You can plan your fragrances by the time of day you will spend most of your time in the garden- Also by the distance you will be from the plantings...I would not want to part with this one!"
5,perfect,I recently started reloading and purchased a Hornady shell trimmer kit. This works for my .223/5.56 cases. Great buy for the money.
4,Kitchen Chemistry Fizzes,"When their inimitable school bus goes on the fritz (or should I say, ""frizz""?,) the students get worried: this is one field trip they don`t want to miss. They`re trying to give their unique teacher a surprise birthday party and need to get to the bakery for the cake. When they finally reach their destination, the unstable bus suddenly shrinks, with everyone in it, to the size of a moth. They dodge the baker`s fly swatter and Ms Frizzle while using kitchen chemistry to get the job done. My boys and I miss the volume of information and mini ""reports"" of the original series, but they still learn and have fun at the same time. They have a new respect for cooking, as edible chemistry. And the baking soda experiment at the back of the book is a rainy day standby in our household: we love the fizz from the Frizz!"
5,"MAgic school bus ""cake""","I liked this book, it was interrasting and it had made me read more and omre till i got through it all. I like the part when the shrunk and the guy was chaseing them and the flew into the cake and went into the oven i didn't think there would make it out."
3,'The Magic School Bus Gets Baked' is questionable,"I don't think children's books should glorify these sorts of ""trips"". But the colors are vivid and I think most of the unsuitable references will go over the heads of its younger readers."
4,"Very nice, Very soft.",I bought both my daughters these for their comforters. They love the soft and cuddly feel. The only thing we were disappointed with was the lack of color choices/designs and also sizes available. Only twin was available and I would have liked one for my king size bed as well.
3,duvet cover snowflake design,Twas a gift and i haven't given it yet. but it appears there is a big value for the price i paid for it.
1,Great Bargain!,"This is warm, beautiful, soft and a fabulous bargain! I highly recommend it... and buy the matching sheets! They're a wonderful combination!"
2,"Lot's of shortcomings, a few good moments here and there....","I like watching independent films -- especially those made on a budget because it's a real test of the people involved and whether or not they have the ability to produce excellence above what they have been dealt. It's certainly possible, ""Fat Girls"" comes to mind. This movie I really wanted to like -- the two leads are especially handsome, if a little wooden in their deliver. at least they had some chemistry and you like watching them when they're onscreen. The father figure was pretty bad -- his line delivery was completely unrealistic and embarrassing. Same way with most of the other cast. The dialogue was unrealistic and inane. I think the director has some good ideas -- he just needs to fully develop them before placing them on celluloid (or a hard drive)."
1,This house is condemned..,"This is one of those movies that makes one think that one could easily make a decent living churning out god-awful movies for the Here network. After all, you'd be hard-pressed to come up with something with a plot as ridiculous as this one. Of course the fact that it's acted with a cast with less acting chops than the GEICO ghecko and directed with the finesse of Ed Wood, Jr. doesn't help.Movies like this make me want to file a class-action discrimination suit. Surely we don't have to put up with movies this bad just because we're gay..."
2,A lot of problems,"A number of reviews have already mentioned the worst thing about this game: the obscenely long cut-scenes. I started to time one of the longer ones, but after 30 minutes I couldn't take it anymore! The cut-scenes add little to the game play. Mostly they're gushy emotional diatribes that have some sort of message like ""give peace a chance"" or ""all you need is love"" or ""don't poop in the tub.""The weaponry in this game was pretty exciting - but you never really USED IT! Despite having guided missles, automatic assault weapons, and grenade launchers - you spend most of the game with a tranquilizer dart, sneaking around. (In fact, I didn't use the grenade launcher once the whole game!)Finally, the story-line is about as convoluted as it gets. By the end of the game, I really don't know what's been going on. With so many ""twist-turns"" they turn a straight-forward game on its head.Save your money. This game is too preachy, and lacks exciting gameplay. ..."
5,Fun game. For original xbox only!!,"I cannot vouch for this particular copy of this game because I have not played it yet, however I have played it in thepast and it's an amazing espionage game. The graphics are pretty good, the story is friggin brilliant, and the gamplay is phenominal. I have never played a more engrossing game. (I still need to play the new mgs games though)."
5,Best Game Ever!,"Okay, first off, the first reveiw on the first page is right in every way except for one: Collecting dog tags is not worthless! If you collect all of the dog tags on both sections (tanker and plant)of the game, you will receive the wig. This makes it so the player has unlimited ammo for any gun that they have. This only adds to the fun of the game, but also makes you work for it. I like that. Secondly: This game kicks so much ...! I love everything about it. You can do so much, even things that are unexpected and lifelike. Take, for instance, knocking on a wall, then hiding. The guard hears your knocking and comes to investigate. When he finds nothing is there, he turns his back to you and walks away, you can then hold him up, or break his neck. TIGHT!! Anyway, this game is a little too cool. BUY IT NOW!"
5,It owns,"This version totally owns the gaming world making it a must get even if you have/had the original ""Sons of liberty"" because it has tons and i mean TONS of extras to keep you happy for a long, long time. Also people who had the older version for ps2 complained they could not play as snake...well in this version you can, so that'll will make you gaming lives abit more better.This is a game that shouldn't be under estimated of a second..for more information on why you should get this see CRIMSON|RED's review"
2,"Too many movies, not enough gameplay...","The look of this game is great. I give major credit to the designers for creating some really good looking locations and characters. However, that alone is not enough to make this game worth owning. I found myself incredibly bored watching the endless movies and chatter between the characters. I buy games to PLAY, not to sit around and watch movies for half an hour waiting to play another level. Besides that, listening to Raiden and his girlfriend argue about their relationship is enough to make a person throw up. Come on, give me a break..."
5,It Captures Perfection,"This game is so good. If you liked the first Metal Gear I recommend this. Everybody says it has to many movies and not enough gameplay, but they are wrong. Instead of complaining about the movies they should actually sit down and watch them. The movies are verrrrrrry impressive and improve this game a lot plus they dont take up a lot of the game. The only thing that bugs me about this game is the codec that beeps you a lot. But other than that excellent game. Whats better than hiding in a box and hanging from railngs to escape from enemies. Oh yeah I'm not sure if this game is better than splinter cell but i can bet that both of them are pretty good."
1,BORING!,"This is the first Metal Gear game that I have played, so I cannot compare this to the other. I like a plot that goes with a game; but, to sit and watch 15 minutes of choppy videos and still frames is too long to wait to get into a game.On top of the seemingly slow story line, I was very disappointed in the gameplay. The graphics are fine and movement is not too bad. The lack of camera control and the horrible angles that the game gives you makes it very difficult to use your character to interact with others and the environment."
3,save your [the money] for splinter cell; don't buy a port,"i subscribe to gamepro. i remember a few issues back when some one from konami was going to make a ""NEW GAME"" on xbox based on mgs2:sol. well, they made the game but to me after reading all the reviews i can say mgs2:sol is nothing more than a straight port. look if they were going to make a new version of mgs2 WHY DIDN'T THEY STOP PLAYING WITH IT AND JUST MAKE THE NEW VERSION LIKE THEY SAID THEY WOULD? well they don't have to cause tom clancy did what konami was supposed to do and didn't.....he made a new game designed for the system, he didn't make a port. GGOD JOB CLANCY. no i have not seen mgs2 and no i have not played it. why would i even look at mgs2:sol when splinter cell is going to be so much better in every category?"
1,One of the biggest disapointments of all time!!!!,"To make this review short and simple.This game SUCKS!!!Its a huge disapointment!It can`t be compared to the great MGS1.The only good part of the game is the begining. Where you control solid snake.And then the rest of the game you control a guy. Who basicly looks like a girl.. And that hair. 80s is not cool anymore!And it have to be the worst story in any game ever!!!Its a script from HELL!!!A 5 year old could write a better story!It takes every turn there is.And now I am being soft on the game..I regret buying this game.And I have never played it since I finished it.Id rather play the great MGS1 one more time.The sequel to this one(when it comes out), is a sure rental. Before buying it.To finish this review of: once again, this game SUCKS!!!Dont buy it!!!"
2,"Lots of Plot, Action(?)","Rent this game to test it before purchasing.It is very different from similar games (Halo, Splinter Cell, etc). Although I like those other games, I did not like Metal Gear Solid.In short, it has VERY long movie scenes (I think I had to watch about 20 minutes of video before playing, and the game is constantly pausing to show you other short movies). You feel more out of control of the player than you do in other shooting games (Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell, Halo, etc). The result of the movies and the awkward control is that you don't feel engaged as a player.After about a half-day I gave up on this one and returned it.If you like to get caught up in the ""plot"" of a shooter videogame, and the action is just an aside, then this is probably a good selection. If you prefer action, and like the plot as a nice backdrop, then you are not likely to enjoy this game."
3,Do not get splinter cell much better Ive done the research,Dont get me wrong stilla great game but splinyer cell is so much better. Trust me. Im not 11 and I know this kind of stuff. I am a beta tester for xbox live. JUst trust me SC much better
3,Way too much mindless plot.,"A great start for a game, but it bored me to death. The actual gameplay isn't too bad, graphics could use some extra attention but not too bad. Having played Halo the controls on this game are far inferior to Halos controls,but every game is inferior to Halo. The main problem with this game is the constant storyline which interupts gameplay constantly. Their is very few instances where there are more than ten minutes of actual gameplay without being interupted from your ""phone"" and having to go through another fifteen minutes of mindless plot. Also the game is very short and I probably should have gotten BloodRayne instead. I gave it three stars simply because it has potential I still don't understand what all the hype was about though."
2,Metal Gear Solid 2.5,"MGS 2 was a really good game, but not as deep as the first one on the PSX. MGS Substance is basically the japanese release of the game (american version didnt have all the extras!!). You can skate, play as new characters, watch the movies with different characters, and more VR type missions. I am sure those things add some replay value to the game, but other than that, there is nothing new going on. Story is exactly the same, graphics are same, control and sound are carbon copy of original MGS 2. If you havent played or owned MGS 2, then substance is the one to get."
2,"Nice concept, terrible execution.","I really like Splinter Cell.MGS2 is no Splinter Cell... not even close!The one main problem is the horrible camera angles. Just let me play in 1st person mode!Next, why in the world doesn't Snake have a knife? If I had just put a terrorist to sleep, knowing he'd wake up again in a few minutes, I'd just slit his throat! At the very least, toss him overboard, toss his weapons overboard, or something!!! And why can't I pick up their weapons?Also, what's with the stupid shaking the body to find stuff? Why can't Snake just go through the pockets, instead of having to shake the body repeatedly, to try and find something? And wouldn't this wake them up if they're asleep???Dumb doesn't even begin to describe the contrived story line and limitations.Wasted 3 hours on it, trying to see if it would ""grow on me"". Yeah, it grew... like fungus.I'm not sure why I'm even giving it 2 stars, but I'm in a generous mood."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I rented this game and it was a total disapointment--you spend most of the time listening to the characters b***h and complain to each other about everything. For example: if you walk around a corner and theres an enemy standing gaurd, instead of ambushing them like in other games, your pansy-a$$ character calls his conections and describes what kind of outfit the enemy is wearing,etc. Like in two minutes from now your really gonna care what color pants the guy was wearing!!It seems as if half the game is listening to pointless conversations or watching lame cut scences. Needless to say I returned this game way before it was due back. Keep this ""saga"" on the playstations; bring on halo, timesplitters 2, and unreal championchip!"
5,Very good game,This is a really fun game. The first time you play the adventure mode it can be difficult. But after once it's more easy and fun. The vr missions are hard. There are 500 of them! I only have 9 left and they are on mgs1 snake. Some of his took me three weeks each. This game is very fun and challenging.
2,Somewhat skewed,"The aim of this book is to provide a short, popular account of Aristotle's philosophy for those that are somewhat acquainted with the history of philosophy. I do recommend the book, but not without qualification. The author needlessly, and perhaps unfairly, attacks Aristotle quite often in the work, which is simply distracting. To the potential buyer: keep in mind that this work was written in 1915 and that the author's criticisms of Aristotle rely on a heavily Platonic bias."
4,High Risk RAIDs!,"High Risk RAIDs!This book is a survey of 100 selected raids since the end of World War II, with conclusions regarding success of these raids with a success rate of 77%; optimum size of the raiding parties ranged from 15-20 men on average but had expertise and extended team practice prior to the raids; and the premium value of deception enterprise the majority of the raids. Overall, I have found this book to be highly readable and although the material is dated it is still historically significant in the study of modern special warfare. I believe that this title will appeal to the professional and armchair military historian and serving military personnel."
1,Virtually unreadable,"I had hoped that this would be an interesting early history of New Hampshire, and it may well be, however the software that converted the original book to digital text butchered the book. Many letters were replaced by symbols or left out entirely. You don't so much read this as attempt to decipher it."
2,def. not vaughan's best,"i keep waiting for vaughan to settle in and pick up the pace on his run of ult. x-men, but he seems content to just coast most of the time, or at the worst, phone it in. this is really a shame b/c his other work is usually consistently worthwhile and he could've done so much great work in the ult universe. this book is completely what you'd expect w/ zero surprises except for a little twist at the end. the story and the characterization are completely forgettable (although longshot's powers are still cool), w/ the main exception of dazzler who is great as a sarcastic wisecracking smart alec. i hate to say it but i'm def. going to skip his next ult x-men arc unless i hear rave reviews."
2,"Oh, well... guess the thrill is gone...","I had been enjoying the ""Ultimate X-Men"" series pretty well up to this point, but was turned off here by the lackluster plotline and even moreso by the slapdash artwork, which stands in painful contrast to the richly detailed illustration of the earlier volumes. This volume felt a lot like the mass-produced X-books of the late '90s, where there were too many heroes and too many titles, and they all started to melt together into one big kaboom-fest, filled with fetishistically hyper-muscular males and inflatible-doll anorexic female characters. Sadly, the series seems to be taking on that same factory-produced feel, and has lost its freshness and revitalized vigor. Hopefully Marvel can get the book back on track, but I'm not sure I'll still be around to read it when they do. Other, better books clamor for my attention."
5,De La Shines,"This album is a must have for anyone into the hip-hop genre. This is the perfect CD. Think of all of the flaws shown in hip-hop: major egos, commercial lyrics, and negativity. But this is an ego-less, positive, and non-commercial masterpiece. The CD starts out as a game show, then goes on to ""The Magic Number"". And it only gets better from there. The lyricism is purely amazing. Prince Pauls production is pure genius. This CD is a must. If you don't have this CD, go buy it ASAP."
4,Smart inventive hip hop,"This album holds up. Even though it's over ten years old at the time of this writing, it's still catchy and fun to listen to."
4,More like 4.5 stars,"Although this album is a little overrated [""Best album of all time"" (which it is not)] It still accounts for a good listen. Although the production is a little outdated by today's standards and it runs a little long (24 tracks), the good tracks are more common than bad ones and a lot of the tracks are funny (""A Little Bit Of Soap""). In an era when gangsta rap was taking over, this was a breath of fresh air from the violence. Other rap acts that were members of the anti violence movement (A Tribe Called Quest) were better in my opinion, but if you've heard their stuff and decide you like it, check this out."
1,Audio quality is crap,"I have just opened my cd and listened to it on my computer and it is complete garbage! The static and quality is worse than if I would have recorded it from a crappy tape player from the speakers. EVERY song is like this. I have contacted the seller, -importcds, to see if I can return or do anything to get some sort of replacement. I would try to sell it to a friend or used cd store, but honestly this cd is worthless and no one would buy it. BUYER BEWARE.I wish I could download the mp3s, but I cannot find them anywhere."
5,Why did De La Soul leave their roots behind?,This is an awesome album. Why did they leave behind the innovation and start producing dime a dozen hip hop [stuff]? The new stuff is no where near as cool as the stuff on this album.
4,Too cool to be a classic - and yet it is.,"Gee...I don't subscribe to the idea that the good old days are better (or worse) musically than now, but,I dunno, De La Soul's ""3 Feet High and Rising,"" (along with records like the Stone Roses album) sometimes make me think that 1989 was some sort of high watermark for popular music.Calling a record a 'classic' or 'landmark' loads on a lot in the way of expectation, but this album can easily carry it off.It doesn't need stuffy admiration or solemn praise.It's fun. It just is.Originally I had the vinyl with the tricky cover that didn't wear so well.From Amazon I got the anniversary version of the CD with the bonus disc and I'm glad I have it."
5,3 feet high,"for a long time I felt this was their best album. Now, I must own it in CD, (for my iPod & personal library). This is a classic!"
4,Read the Infortunate,"This book is a great way to learn about early American life in the cities. It is well written in a very unique first person, and true.I read it in college and loved it, and i think that it would still be a good read for anyone highschool to adult. It's a quick read."
5,The Best Movies Can Be,"It is a real shame this movie did not enjoy greater commercial success. I took my whole family including my 82 year old mother to it when it was in theaters. Everyone loved it. But my sister who follows movies much more than I do had not even heard of it prior to that. No explosions, car crashes or juvenile vulgarity means no significant promotion budget I assume.The plot involves a motorcycle but it is decidedly not a motorcycle movie. It is a classic story of the underdog battling against seemingly insurmountable odds. It is a little like Rocky but of course Anthony Hopkins isn't much like Sylvester Stallone. And it is based on a true story which puts it more in common with Hoosiers, another classic underdog film.No praise of Hopkin's performance can do it justice; you have to see it. This is a superbly crafted piece of entertainment in just about every aspect."
5,Feel good solid story,"Loved this film. It has heart. The production quality was high, the writing was real."
3,Fastest Indian,"Movie was ""Ok"". I think I expected a little more drama from Anthony Hopkins. I am now a little wiser on the Indian motorcycle history."
5,The Worlds Fastest Indian,"This is an excellent movie for anyone, especially those who love motorcycles. I also enjoy true stories. Anthony Hopkins is an excellent actor, and I think this was his best role ever!"
5,Fully Enjoyed the Movie,This movie is a great.If you are looking to get inspired this is the movie. Hopkins does a flawless job in portraying a Mr. Monroe as a loving down to earth man in chase of his dream.
4,The Fastest Indian,"A real surpirse. This one hit the theaters and was gone so fast I didn't have the privilege of seeing it on the big screen. Anthony Hopkins at his heartwarming best. An endearing story about a ordinary guy who has an extraordinary talent for loving life, people and engines. Hopkins travels from his home in New Zealand with steely determination to race at the salt flats in California. He meets a long string of wonderful people all of whom are only too happy to help him through the day. The movie is a study, albeit a bit Pollyanna, of the best of humanity's children. A great story, don't let this surprise pass you by. I'll watch it over and over."
5,More than a motorcycle movie,"This is a great movie about one aspect of motorcycling, but is much more. It is a great story of determination and home grown ""can do"" attitude in pursuit of a lifelong goal."
4,Living out a dream,"Burt Munro worked on his Scout motorcycle for 25 years, making it as fast as he possibly could. His dream was to go to the Bonneville Salt Flats during Speed Week and try to break the world's record for motorcycles in his class. This was quite a lofty dream for a man from New Zealand who had very little money and very few resources, except for his ingenuity and inventiveness. In this movie he fights his way through every obstacle, including failing health, administrative requirements by the race officials, and even a close brush with a rattle snake. Anthony Hopkins does a masterful job of portraying this gentle man who had a fire inside him that could only be quenched by realizing his dream."
3,Pros and cons,"Anthony Hopkins is terrific as the unflappable, good-natured protagonist. But the movie is filled with episodic subplots that are silly and sentimental, in which gruff strangers are instantly won over by his personality.He is presented as jumping unceremoniously into bed with every woman who asks politely, which is about half of the female characters of any consequence. I assume that that represents not a faithful retelling of Burt Munro's real story, but instead just Hollywood's imputation of its own free and easy morals to everyone it portrays."
2,Another classic Anthony Hopkins!,"Great movie, shows what determination can do with a dream! Regardless of age."
2,Documentary (an extra) highlights movie's failure,"The character created by Anthony Hopkins is not credible--he has the wrong type of charm. In the ""Extras"" on the DVD, watch the documentary ""Burt Munro - Offerings to the God of Speed"". It captures the character and charisma of such people and is worth more than the whole movie.If I could have put the above aside, the movie might have been a modestly entertaining diversion--yet another insipid variation of the road trip formula. The movie's Burt Monro amiably drifts through his adventure, often propelled by the characters around him (rather than him being an irresistible force). At times I felt that I was watching a variation on ""Forrest Gump"" (movie version).The overall tone of this movie is ""quiet inevitability,"" a phrase that I never thought would apply to a movie involving riding motorcycles, much less racing them."
1,World's Fastest indian DVD was defective,"I ordered World's Fastest Indian for my son's birthday. This is one of my favorite movie's and I was excited about sharing it with him. It was defective, however, so I was asked to print a return label and send it back for an exchange. I did that, but the second one was defective as well. Great movie, missed opportunity."
5,Anthony Hopkins Does it again,"Mr Hopkins never dissapoints, if he is in a movie rest assured knowing it will be great. This movie is no exception. He plays a charming character who meets lots of new and interesting friends along his journey to set the land speed record."
5,Another Hopkins great performance,"Having seen this movie before, I found an occasion to gift a copy to a relative. The title did, at first, confuse me, since I did not know that much about motorcycles. However, the movie won me over. Well worth seeing. And so, I was happy to purchase a copy for another person."
5,Worlds Fastest Indian,"This is one of the best movies ever as are most ""true stories"". It shows what determination can accomplish!"
4,Delightful,"What a delightful movie! Recommended to me by a friend who had also enjoyed ""Cars"", this movie handled a number of points well. Clearly, it is a story about motors and engines and going just as fast as you can, but it also treated with sensitivity the private life of a man dealing with a dream he had had for years. Sex? Not much. Guns? None. Friendship? You bet. People helping people? Sure enough. I have watched this movie a number of times. I recommend it to you."
4,The Worlds Fastest Indian,"I enjoyed the movie. It was a bit disjointed at the start. The main character overcomes obstacles in some ""unique"" ways. After watching the movie I do have to wonder how much of the movie really happened and how much was added to spice up the story. I don't purchase movies very often. This is a movie I will watch more then once!"
4,Uplifting and Inspiring,This is one of those feel-good movies about a man with a dream who strives to persevere in the face of adversity.
5,"""A Thoughtful Customer"" Says It All","I can do no more than second the superb review by ""A Thoughtful Customer,"" with the note that I would not have pulled this movie to watch if it had not had Anthony Hopkins. His participation was for me a guarantee of nuance and value, and the movie proved to be all that ""A Thoughtful Customer"" discusses."
5,Worlds Fastest Indian - EXCELLENT,"Excellent movie! Uplifting, for anyone who love speed or has a dream. A feel good movie. About a real icon of motor history Burt Munroe, played by a real actor, Sir Anthony Hopkins."
3,PROBLEM START-UP,"Don't know why, but had a problem getting the disc to ""play"". Had to re-insert several times before I could get past the initial screen freeze ups."
5,The same thing. It was bought as a gift.,He had heard of the movie but had never seen it. I bought it as a gift and I'm sure he will enjoy it.
5,Good movie!,"My husband bought this movie, as he is a huge motorcycle fan. I ended up watching this movie with him one evening, and it surprisingly was really good! I'm not that big into motorcycles, but there is a sweet story behind the motorcycle-theme. We both really enjoyed it!"
4,Lovers of motorcycles,"Entertaining, well done. Excellent acting. Good story line. Very enjoyable movie to watch"
5,The World's Fastest Indian,"Loved it. It was so good that after seeing a friend's movie, we bought it from you."
4,World's Fastest Indian,"This was an excellent movie. Acting, scenery, and story all meshed beautifully."
5,World's Fastest Indian,I found this movie to be both entertaining and educational. I am surprised that it didn't get more publicity when it first came out. Anthony did a wonderful job protraying the character. I give this movie 2 thumbs up!!!
4,Feel Good Movie,"This movie underscores the saying ""never give up on your dreams"". Makes you feel like you can take on the world."
5,It was great!,"I wish we could all be like Burt when we grow UP. Its never too late to achieve a dream. Great story, great acting, great writing. I was completely entertained and it even made my eyes get teary. THAT is next to impossible for me in real life much less in a movie."
5,Great little movie about a man and his passion,"This movie is the true life story (with some embelishments) about Burt Monroe, a 70+ year old man who had worked with his motorcycle for 45 years, and a dream on taking it to the Bonnaville Salt Flats. In New Zealand, he was a big fish in a small pond, but through hard work, perseverence, and one heck of an intuition, he proves that you can continue to be big on the main stage.Anthony Hopkins does an excellent job playing the part of this feisty gentleman from down under. A great job by the supporting cast as well. The behind the scenes footage, and the true life 30 minute documentary of the real Burt Monroe are excellent additions to enhance the story for you as well. Check this out, a really good movie for all."
5,AWESOME,"I love the online purchasing at Amazon. It's all cut and dried. So easy, even us electronically challenged people can do it. Thanks PEACE"
2,very boring and....what's the point?,"like what roger ebert have said about this movie: 'it's kinda boring to me', i couldn't have agreed more. dream, speed, fastest...whatever, what's the point? how many people got such white teeth at that time? well, i had to use the fast forward remote to finish this movie sooner. guess i was the fastest viewer to finish it. this is a quite pointless movie."
1,Package arrived with a rattle,"The item was ordered to be given as a gift. It arrived sealed, but the package rattled. I wraped it in gift paper and sent it off, however the recipient of the gift never commented. I don't know if the condition was good, or if the rattle indicated a damaged DVD jewl box."
4,Motorcycle Fan,"Enjoyed this great movie! Liked it because it was a true story and the race on the Salt Flats. Enough action, but not the violance, like most movies of today!"
4,Great movie,Totally reminded me of my father-in-law. Great gift for all eccentric inventors or speed enthusiasts! Anthony Hopkins is extremely colorful and entertaining in this film.
1,Very poorly made.,They are extremely thin canvas sheaths that look like they used about $.25 worth of material to make. the machetes will actually start slicing through the sheath after just a few uses. i'm highly disappointed in the seymour brand and will never buy from them again.
5,WOW,"This was such a great book, and the computer game Nancy Drew: Treasure in the royal tower is based from this game. I enjoyed the book much more. Everyone should read this book!!!"
1,ANOTHER BITTER OLD MAN TRIES TO CASH IN,"You have to give Radosh credit. He can tell which way the wind is blowing. Radosh knows there is a market for this type of book. Now that he is a Neo-Fascist he can make the round of talk shows on Fox to push his new book. Never more than a marginal figure in acedemic circles, here he shows himself to be an embarrasing writer. By constantly bragging about his sexual exploits, at least Radosh proves that progressives have much more fun than Nazis. If Rush or O'Reilly wrote a book like that I'm sure it would be MUCH shorter."
1,great idea fails to perform over time,"We own a Bully electric mower. The first one we owned stopped working because the relay switch was faulty. The second one we owned worked for the first season, but has since failed on us because the engine won't turn over even when the battery is charged. We have not received any customer service response and help for this problem, so I have to give a very low review."
1,Mower works one season only,"I had the exact same experience as the previous reviewer. My Bully mower worked fine at first, but the cutting time kept getting shorter and shorter. Finally, it just stopped working, even though the battery was fully charged. Customer Service is TERRIBLE... you're on your own with a bogus mower. Stay away from this brand."
5,Great piece of equipment,"I usually dont write reviews but this is truly a great product. It is very easy to install with minimal effort and the directions are straight forward. My only problem was finding the stud, but that was due to the poor stud finder I was using and not this wall mount. All necessary equipment was included that you could possibly need for this installation. I currently am using this mount with a 20"" TV but it seems sturdy enough that I would feel confident in mounting a bigger TV and have no fear of it falling off. This is a great price for this useful item. I would definately recommend to anyone who is thinking of mounting their flat panel TV against the wall."
4,Good little mount,"ive already bought two of this mount. one for a 30"" lcd and another for a 32"" lcd. the mount definitely holds these tv's nicely. one good thing about the mount is that it is more forgiving when installing. if you dont get it perfectly level you can adjust the pivot of the tv to level it. also nice, it mounts on only one stud. makes installation faster."
4,Well made and works great.,"Wow! This mount was everything I needed. Strong, easy to install and not bad looking. I mounted my 23"" Samsung basically in a corner next to a fireplace and simply swing the arm out for viewing. The mounting plate (200 x 100) fit right on my tv and actually made mounting easier. I would have given it 5 stars except the wire management system, as mentioned in other reviews, leaves a little to be desired. The concept is great, but the holes in the tube are small, and it is difficult to get more than the power cord and a coaxial through the tube. Fortunately for me, this is a third tv and that's all I needed, but I can see the problem if you wanted to hook up more than just your cable/satellite."
4,TV Mount,It seems very well made but it would not allow me to position the set where I wanted without the set sticking out quite a distance from the wall. I returned it and bought a different brand from a local store where I could see exactly how far the set would be offset from the mounting area (a wall stud).
5,Quality and Value,"I bought this mount for my 23"" Samsung lcd and it is great. It came with an adapter to fit my tv, was easy to install, and looks pretty good. The omnimount that fits my tv is over twice the price so I am very happy with my purchase. I also received this item just 3 days after I ordered it, with regular shipping."
1,Doesn't Work for VESA 200x200 flat panels,"The product is fine, Amazon's misleading description isn't. This product will not work with a VESA 200 x 200 flat panel even though the product description says: ""VESA 75, 100 and 200 compliant mounting brackets included."" To use this mount with a VESA 200x200 panel another adapter must be purchased for ~$30 delivered. Shame on Amazon."
4,Solid mount,I have had this mount for almost two years. It works as advertised. It is a solid unit and does not feel loose. It looks good and helps to hide wires by having the wires pass through the arms. It is a good looking unit that works. The base screws look weak but they will support your TV without coming loose. The only downside and the reason I didn't give it four stars is that you will probably need to by the adapter plate as the most common mount plate is the one not included. This is the mount plate: [...]
4,Worth the money,"This mount was just what I needed to hang my 23' LCD in the corner. It's true to its description, sturdy and easy to put up."
4,Stylish with one minor flaw.,"Very nice product, but the mounting screws and holes were too small for my 26"" WS LCD. I had to drill the mounting holes larger and acquire some screws. Other than that the item is better than I expected."
4,What I needed!,"Got this for a 27"" flatscreen in my bedroom and it was just what I needed for the price I liked."
5,Excellent!,"As with all mounts, wall studs determine your ultimate location. Make sure you're realistic with your final location (especially with a swing arm mount). That being said, this mount is great! It took less than 5 minutes to install (after deliberating where to locate it). The enclosed mounting screws are way more than sufficient as long as you have a decent screw gun. Don't bother ordering an adapter plate either, as one is provided. I mounted a 26"" Samsung LCD that I swing about 90 degrees and tilt slightly down to view in bed. Looks great, it's beefy, the tension is completely adjustable and the Amazon price blows away the $129 Sears/K-Mart price. I looked at everything before ordering. This mount can't be touched even when comparing to significantly more expensive units."
4,Great product!!!,I purchased this mount last month. It is for my 20 in t.v. in my office.It works great. The price was better than my local stores.I would not use it for a 40 in t.v. but for 20-37 its perfect.The arm swings out and the t.v. can be angled anyway you want it.No regrets!!!
4,Perfect,"I now have 2 of this mount, one for the living room and one for the bedroom. It's small enough to not be seen behind a 23"" TV and powerful enough to hold a 32""..."
5,TV mount,We are very satisfied with this TV mount. We needed a way to mount a 26 inch TV so it could be seen from two different rooms. We mounted it on the door frame. Then it can be swung to view from either location.
5,Very pleased! Highly recommend.,"I was very pleased with the quality of this swing-arm mount. It is quite sturdy and my 56 Lbs 40"" LCD has no drift at all. It stays right where it put it, no matter what the position of the arm. Assembly and mounting was pretty straightforward for anyone with average savvy of such things. It was half of Fry's in-store price for the EXACT same item. Be advised, though, that even though it comes with an adapter bracket for larger VESA mounting requirements (i.e., 100x200mm), I had to make a late night trip to Fry's after all to get a 200x200 VESA adapter plate for my TV ($28 for the flat steel plate, $49 for the whole swingout mount).I recommend this without reservation!"
3,It will do,"This is a standart mount that is great in concept. The screws that it comes with are extremely poor, but the base unit is worth the buy. I had to buy new hex screws to get them in the stud because the other screws wouldnt take and stripped completely. Great buy but was a bit of a hassle. thanks!"
5,Premier Wall Mount,"This mount was easy to install and very heavy duty. It being a universal mount, the screws that come with it may be a little short to fit the particular TV it was purchased for. This was encountered by me and I went to my local home improvement store and purchased screws longer that would fit into the holes of the mount all the way into the TV, no problem. The mount maker tried to tell me I needed the specific one for my TV, a Vizio, but the only difference in the mounts was the screw length and of course the price, about 50 dollars more for the Vizio one. Great purchase great item!"
3,"Good, but no ""General""","Buster Keaton does well here, but the movie lacks the sense of adventure and fun his better works. Still an important addition to any proper Keaton collection."
4,"Sweet, Pure, Sincerity... all through her lyrics!!!","I stumbled across this cd while at Family Christian. I was surprised when I saw cross movement records label because I am familar with some of there artist and never heard of her. Well I really like this cd because I can hear in her voice the sincerity and love she has for God. My FAVORITE song is the last song on her cd called ""Thank You""... the song expresses what I want to say to God soo well. This cd has some songs with nice beats you can dance to, some songs that will make you reflect, and some songs that can even lead you to worship. It is not like any of the other cd's I have (it has it's own style and a latina type of feel on some songs as well). I would say give Michelle a try."
1,What a piece of crap!,"Take a bunch of no-talents and give them a video camera and this is what you get.Their friends must have wrote the previous reviews, 'cause there was not one good thing about this ""so-called"" film.Bunch of whiney nobodys who will stay nobodys.Run . . . Don't walk . . . Away from this crap!!!!"
5,Vetrap is perfect for the job.!,"This did the task very well, my dog had a hot spot I wanted her to get out of habit of licking it and this really helps, not too expensive but you must be careful not to wrap too tight. She got over the habit of licking it and it healed up very well with this and a non stick pad with Neosporin or Bannix spary on the pad then I just wrapped it. Stayed on well as long as your dog does not rip it off. I just had to watch her or put on the ""elizabethan collar""."
3,Kindle version has formatting issues,"I read this book years ago and enjoyed it. I can't say the same for the Kindle version, as it is riddled with hyphenated words with the hyphens showing all the time instead of just at line breaks. This is extremely distracting... enough so that I quit reading.Did anybody bother to proof this before it was published? Three stars for the story, zero stars for the formatting."
5,"excellent, but not for everyone","Introduced by Heuer in 1969 as a motor-sports instrument, the Monaco still remains contemporary in its design. Tag has wisely chosen to continue producing a number of the auto racing circuit models that made Heuer famous. ( as these are much more interesting and well styled than Tag's own designs. ) There is a misunderstanding shared by some who have commented on this watch and a few sellers who offer the model online. The crystal is made from acrylic true to it's vintage predecessor. It is never sapphire regardless of how listed on some web pages. A large square watch such as this, will incur more wear and tear over time than one of more conventional proportions fitted with a scratch resistant window. Truly a specialty piece better suited to collectors than as an everyday ""work watch"". I happen to consider the Monaco to be on my short list of favorites, and finally have the privilege to own one."
4,Second album by pop-samba band Karametade,"-------------------------------------------Karametade""Karametade"" (2)(Sony Music, 1998)-------------------------------------------This is the second album by Brazilian pop-samba band Karametade... Like many Brazilian artists, they have that weird thing about giving a bunch of their records the same name. So, just for clarity's sake, here are the songs on this particular album:1 Toda mulher2 Milagre3 Dana do Karametade4 Grito de paixo5 Dengosa6 Menino assustado7 Pelo telefone8 Eu e ela9 Passa passa a borracha10 Tá pegando fogo11 No deu pra segurar12 É de voc que eu gosto13 Se ainda me quer14 Louca seduo"
3,"An ok hat, not the best","This hat look much cooler in the photo then it does when you actually get it. It is very military looking when you put it on, and it looks silly. It is not what I had imagined it to look like at all. The mesh goes all the way around to the back, there is a size changer thing in the back to make it tighter of looser. It is a cool looking hat, but when you put it on it looks silly. It is more for show then looks. So I wouldnt buy this hat unless you are into the military look, it is just a strange shaped hat, I am not sure if it is just my head or what, but it wasnt worth the money I paid for. Love slipknot, but I hate this hat."
4,Possibly Uris' Best,"This courtroom drama allows Uris to tell the story of the ghosts remaining from the holocaust without using cliched storylines. Instead, he tells an honest story - so honest it actually happened to him - while presenting a complex villain who we begin the novel sympathizing with.Not only does this book present the difficulties in retelling the stories of the holocaust in its aftermath, it also does a fantastic job of explaining the British legal system.That being said, Uris still writes rather wooden dialogue. Fortunately, his books are more about story and character, so that flaw can be overlooked."
5,Uris' best book!,"This is Leon Uris' best book -- far better then Exodus, in my opinion.Abraham Cady learns of his Jewish heritage from his father -- that most of his family had been exterminated at the Jadwiga concentration camp. After becoming immersed in his faith after his father's death, Cady decides to write a book called The Holocaust. In it, he accuses a surgeon, Dr. Adam Kelno, as being one of the doctors at the Jadwiga camp that did experiments on other human beings and was a war criminal. Dr. Kelno finds out about the book, reads it, and decides to sue Cady in court and prove that Cady is a liar. It is a book of deep feeling and gripping suspense; one that deals with the Holocaust and the repercussions that happened so many years later after families found out what actually happened to their relatives. It's a brilliant book -- highly recommended."
4,Typical Leon Uris,Loved the detail and the research...This is my second reading of the works of Uris and I am still amazed at what Man can do to Mankind!
4,"Very Intense, A Little Dated","The author wrestles with the landmark question of the twentieth century: individual responses to situations of the holocaust. This is a fast-moving and well-layered novel about a lawsuit filed against an author who may have libeled a doctor in a concentration camp. The contrast between the civil British legal system and the horrors of prison life are shocking and disturbing. The author provides a balanced portrait of the pressures facing individuals making life or death decisions. He does not sugarcoat man's behavior in normal or abnormal times. Uris is a fine writer, whose style is attractive."
5,"Even better than ""Exodus""","""QB VII"" combines a touching Holocaust story with one of the best-written courtroom dramas ever. When Abraham Cady, a ""tortured"" writer who publishes his masterpiece of a Holocaust memorial, accuses the knighted Dr. Kelno of war crimes, the Doctor is goaded into suing to protect his reputation. The life stories that lead up to the trial, and the ensuing court case, are completely absorbing. The testimony of the victims is heartbreaking, yet compelling. I literally couldn't put the book down."
3,QB7Review,"Very predictable story. The writing is a little out of date by today,s usage. It is still a decent read even if it is a little long."
3,Essentially a good story but a bit tenious in the telling.,"This is my second reading of this novel, I read it when it was first published. While I like the story line I found the book to be a bit tedious due to what I consider unnecessary repetition and the constant explanations of the English court procedures. The actions of the characters in court sufficiently explains what is happening. I dislike authors who assume they are smarter than their readers and pad their books."
4,Loads of fun!,"Spyro came to me as a gift. My cousin gave it to me for my birthday. I haven't played many PS1 or PS2 games, but so far I'm enjoying Spyro. He moves around to new and beautiful places to gather up these dragonflies to save the dragon world. I'm not sure which characters are new to the series, but all of them are well animated. Spyro's movements are very smooth and look very real. I hope more games like this are released for PS2."
2,spyro got STUCK in the ground from a dive,"ive always liked spyro since i played it at a friends house, and i ended up really liking it. it started when we got a PS1 and had a blast beatting and borrowing them. 1-3 were great. then our PS1 broke and we got a gamecube. and at Christmas we also got number 4 of spyro. the only problem was is that it was the same villian(i thought he'd be a MORRON to mess with me again), plot, scattered junk, graphics, spyro moves a wierd and SLOOOOW way, all of the above are games 1-3 mixed up into a bunch of TRASH! well time for the results. ooooooooohhhhhhh!graphics,1-5, it looks like its been made out of PAPER.sound,2-5, havent played for so long i forgot, one thing i do remember is the ""YOUCH"" every time spyro runs into a FREAKEN wall. ANOYING.game,1-5, its to short, theirs NO fun in collecting DUMB gems, and theres nothing to go back for.OVERALL,I GIVE IT A 2-5. piece of JUNK!i reccomend only renting and NO buying. get an older spyro."
1,Don't bother....terrible!!,"Game is not smooth, tremendous load times and hangs up occasionally. Definitly not on par with past Spyro games and NOT worth the 49.95 they charge. The developers should be ashamed!Compared to the graphics and game play of a game like Jak and Daxter this is truly disappointing. Save your money. I wish I had."
3,"Surprisingly, not as good","I am a huge fan of Spyro. The first game I ever got for my original Playstation. Obviously, I was anxiously awaiting the newest version for PS2. Sadly, I am disappointed. In one evening, I have seen pretty much of the worlds that there are to see. There are only 12. Which I thought surprising given the vastness of the other three versions.But perhaps the worst part was the jumpy camera. As you move around, the camera can't keep up with you and then does this funky thing where everything around you seems to go in slow motion.Some of the graphics are good. But stacking this against the likes of Sly Cooper and Ratch and Clank, I fear our little dragon may have lost a little of his sheen."
3,Ok if it's cheap,"i bought this game for $50.00. i don't think it's even worth $30! only buy this game if it's cheap. i loved the first three spyro games, but this one's just not as good."
1,a video game nightmare,this game looks fun. BUT beleive me its not. this game is awfully executed. the storyline is just HORRIBLE. when you first start playing the game. the graphics look ok. but when you start running. the camera goes completely out of control. the graphical framerate litteraly jumps when you run. im not kidding. the controls are terrible. they work against you the entire game. the most simple of maneuvers. requires great and i mean great skill in spyro enter the dragonfly. but that is the only reason. this game isnt cakewalk the entire time. because of the unbalanced control and camera scheme. the rest of the game is entirely easy. you should have no trouble reaching the last boss on this game in about 3 hours. i know this is more of a complaint board than a reveiw. but seriously people. rent this game before you buy it. even if you loved the other spyros to death.
2,Don'y buy this piece of junk!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this game thinking it would be just like the other spyro games, when i saw that insomniac was not working on this game i became a little suspicios.... this game is nothing like the other spyro games, its junk."
1,What happened?!?!,"There are two things that make this game at least slightly enjoyable. The water graphics are pretty neat, and everyone talks more during the game, especially Spyro. Otherwise this game is a waste of time! I LOVED the three games for the PS1, and was looking forward to the PS2 games. Thankfully I rented the game from a video store, or else I would have wasted wait like twenty bucks? Anyway the game is boring, slow, and down right hideous. Any Spyro fan will just be taken aback. I turned off the game after only five minutes, if even that long. If you want to play the game for yourself, RENT IT! If you like it enough, hey buy it."
4,Spyro!,"I LOVE Spyro, and I waited so long for this game!! It looks great, but nothing really new and surprising was in the game(like in the last ones). It did end rather fast also. But if you are a Spyro fan, you will like this game too. There are no other games like this out there. It isn't as EASY EASY as the other ones (this I say because there was one mini-game I couldn't beat and that prevented me from getting to the final boss. Grrr.) but it feels familiar. I really hope that another one is made that will top this one, but still be beatable."
2,What the heck did they do to Spyro?,"...those people who said it glitches up and is jerky are right. We only played one hour and it froze. And, please, how do you get to the other levels? It makes no sense compared to the other Spyros. If you like Spyro, I suggest you get Spyro 3. (Return of the Dragon?) This clunker belongs in the discount rack. Don't pay top dollar for it. You will be kicking yourself if you do."
3,Too Much Loading Time,"I've been collecting Spyro games ever since I played the first, and although this one is good, it has it's downs too. First of all, there is WAY too much loading time. You could finisha novel during the loading time (well not really, but you get the point). The game does have the best graphics out of all the Spyro games, and it is cool how you get different types of breath, but the loading time gets so annoying. Also, although I like the Spyro games, the gameplay get a little old. The makers tried to give this game originality, but it just didn't work. Anyway, if this was the first spyro game, I probably would have gave it less. But because it is a sequel, and I know the game, I probably added about another star."
1,Die Hard Spyro Fan,"I purchased this game for my nephew. I told him to tell me if there was a problem with it. Of course he didn't tell me that the game display bounced between black and white and color, or that it was IMPOSSIBLE to finish or win some objectives. I can't believe I paid $50, for an essentially UNPLAYABLE game!!! I guess next time I won't ask a 9 year old what he thinks of a game! Don't buy this one until Universal comes out with a less buggy version."
3,Good X-mas gift,"I recommend this game for everybody & as a great christmas present. Very easy to handle and hours of fun. There is the main quest or journey of the game and also there are a bunch of smaller or sub-games, like catching cows with a ufo. My son loves to just stand there and shoot ice from Spyro's mouth, he doesn't even need the rest of the game. He just stands there shooting. Furthermore it is a good game for people of all ages."
2,Eh... Decent...,"This is kinda a big step down for Spyro. Seriously, this game is quite buggy and glitchy, and pretty darn short, and it really seems unfinished. I absolutely loved the three games on the PlayStation 1, they are great. But now there's this? It doesn't really seem like they put in much effort, seems like they really rushed this game. As a Spyro fan, I own it. But really, if you aren't a Spyro fan, I wouldn't try this game. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,"3 1/2 stars, MAYBE FOUR","look, new makers, new company, new graphics. the first 3 will never be beat. but its a new time and a new age for spyro. i know i reviewed this game WAYYYY too late in time though. its 2012! we already have skylander out, (which btw redrew spyro which makes him look kinda creepy to be honest.) but its just a fun game overall. it still has some originality despite some glitches. jsut accept it for what it is. still fun game to play."
1,Too many bugs sucked any possible enjoyment from this game,"I've been a big fan of the spyro games for many years, and in my opinion, this was the absolute worst game of the entire series. Every single copy that I bought of this game had so many bugs that it sucked out any possible enjoyment I might have gotten from the game. I went through 3 copies, all bought new, of this game and all were so full of bugs and glitches that I returned my copy and finally finished it by renting a copy. When my character wasn't randomly dying for no apparent reason, the gameplay was ok, but honestly, it wasn't worth the frustration. So, if you enjoy your character randomly dying by somehow falling to his death while on solid ground every 5 minutes, then play this game. Otherwise, I wouldn't even bother wasting my time with it."
3,Game's ok,"I'm a little disappointed in the game. The graphics are beautiful, but it takes FOREVER for the game to load. The camera doesn't move as fast I'd like. I seems like Spryo is slower and not as responsive as in previous games"
1,Trash,How sad is this game> Probably the best platformer on the Playstation is now the worst on the PS2. Worse than the 5-year old original technically and it doesn't play as well and full of glitches. ...
1,Spyro Is Dead,"Spyro has long been one of my favorite Playstation games. When I heard about Spyro: Enter the Drangonfly, I could not wait to play it, now I wished I had. Within the first hour of play I realized I was in for a huge let down. The graphics jumped more that Spyro did. Gliches in the scenery included such things as flying though a ""solid"" mountain and finding myself in what can only be described as a black hole, and the scenery becoming a blur as you try to run or even when your walking in some areas. The lack of areas to explore was a real dissapointment. Finally, the final fight lasted no more than 2 minutes and with no fun scenes at the end as in all other Spyro games. I must agree with another review I just read on this page. This game seems more like a...knock-off, then the Spyro we all loved once upon a time."
1,loyal spyro fan,"Terribly disappointing. I've been anxiously awaiting the release of Spyro 4 for months now. It's hard to believe it's from the same makers of the first 3! The graphics are good but that's where it ends. There are MANY flaws. Sound errors, graphic glitches, slow load times, and non-responsive controls just to name a few. Surely, the makers will correct some of these problems and re-release this game later. The game really should be recalled it is so bad. I've been on the Spyro web site and everyone seems to agree."
3,nothing to write home about,Basically they ran out of ideas.This is barely different than any of the other Spyro games.You'd think that with an opportunity to really do something with a fun game like Spyro on PS2 it would have been a lot better.Big letdown.
1,A huge disapointment,"No matter how you play this one its a crummy cheap version of the first Spyro games. In all the races, no matter how many of the bad guys you pass, you never get past being 3rd in the races, no way to win. We had huge distortions in the game, like all of one bad guy's nose acting like a lighthouse with it extending out across the screen where ever he looked. We hated playing this one, save your money for Sly Cooper or Ty they play better and are much more fun than this one."
1,Terrible,"This is a terrible Playstation 2 game. One of the worst that I have encountered in a long time. Jerky screen, very, very slow loading and extremely childish, even though I think a child would lose patience with this game....a big waste of money."
1,Waste of Money!!!!!,"For the last 2 years I have been waiting on Spyro to come out for PS2 - well it did and what a disappointment!!!!! The camera angles are just awful - they can't keep up with the action. The graphics are done as if by a 3rd grader and there isn't an original idea in the whole game. It has all been taken from the previous 3 Spyro games and the worst part is that all 3 of those are far superior to the one made especially for the PS2. Was leery when Spyro 3 came out and it wasn't by Insomniac, but was pleasantly suprised - same hopes for Year of the Dragonfly - didn't pan out. If you must play this Spyro - RENT IT - DON'T BUY IT!!!! Not a good Christmas present idea if your children are familiar with Spyro and have any game skills are all."
2,Spyro The Dragom Enter the Dragonfly,I was very excited about the new game.I am sorry to say that it does not hold up to the prvious three games though.I think that they over did it with the grapics and it was no where near as fun as the past games were.I found it hard to tell where some of the things you were looking for.I hope to see the game to be better next time
3,Spyro enter the dragon fly,The game is fun and interesting but it freezes like it has a clitch to it every now and again.
3,spyro,Game is a little to easy but challenges are hard...not as fun as some of the others but still enjoyed it.
1,PSOne Spyros are better,"I wish I would have rented this one first so I could have lamented spending 4 bucks as opposed to 50 bucks. The gameplay is disappointing, confusing, and difficult to control. Besiders sharper graphics, this a a big step backwards for Spyro."
1,Game unplayable,"I love the Spyro games, but I bought this and returned it because the glitches made it unplayable. Absolutely horrible. Do NOT waste your money. Ratchet and Clank is a terrific substitute though."
2,it is over,"well i am going to admit that i was in to spyro when it came to ps1. whith all 3 games but after playing the demo in ""Playstation magazine"". spyro is slow and fat. He need to loss some wait. i was expecting better than that i think they are going to be the L.A lakers with a 3 times champions sorry but they killed spyro."
2,Doesn't do justice to my favorite purple dragon,"I just finished this game, and it was a HUGE disappointment. Spyro the Dragon 1, 2, and 3 are my favorite games of all time. This game has all of the tasks, but none of the joy of the previous Spyro's. I experienced dozens of bugs and freeze ups during the game. On one level, and entire rooms graphics just disappeared! Big Spyro fans will probably buy the game anyway, but I would suggest renting for a week. The game was mercifully short, but the load times were unbearable.Overall, it feels like they pumped this thing out in time for Christmas without any Quality Assurance. Nevermind that getting a badly put together Spyro game is the saddest Christmas gift ever.If there is any justice, all involved will be fired, or worse yet, be forced to play this mess. Spyro deserves so much more!!!"
1,extremely disappointed by the ending,"I don't know about everybody else, but when I play a game, i like to feel rewarded at the end for my hard work. With the other spyro games, you got an extra secret level to play at the end. At end of Enter the Dragonfly, you get nothing. I felt so screwed at the end. I feel like other gamers were right, this game feels unfinished and totally lacked any creativity. A total disappointment. I wish I'd never finished it."
2,This is different.,"I loved Spyro on PS1 and I couldn't wait to get a PS2 to play Enter the Dragonfly. Well,I got it on day and I hated the graphics and dialouge. I thought the worlds were coool, but not that much fun. I also didn't like how Spyro looked when her moved. It looked so bad and fake. I couldn't wait for a new Spyro to come out after I played Enter the Dragonfly."
1,Very poor excuse for a game... oops. I meant loading.,"Yes. Loading. Like CB: Wrath of Cortex, most of this game is loading. I can never enter staightly to Cloud9 'cus then loading ALWAYS froze. And The slowness. Yuck.Pros:Graphics are amazing.Fine Sound and Music.Its Spyro. What can I say?Get to torch Moneybags. OHYES!Cons:Loading.Veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeery slooooooooooow...Short.Graphics sometimes DISAPPEAR!!! Poof! GRaphics GOOOOOONE!!! I was once on the level DragonFly Dojo and the environment disappeared. I walked. I fell. Fell. Fell. Repeat. I restart console and have to watch more loadings.Loadings are Toxic.Why dont you load somethin'.Open your load.Load.Load.Load.Load.Load.Load.Load.Load.Load.Load.Load.Load.Load.Load.Load. Repeat forever.Graphics: 9.5Sound: 8.0Gameplay: 0.5Fun: 3.5Overall: 0.5Loadings take: 99.9% of the entire game.Final Verdict:Do not even rent it. Its one of the worst games created. A newly born baby could make a better game."
4,"Lots of potential, but poorly executed","I loved the previous Spyro games, and was thrilled to see Universal take up the series - but very dissapointed with the result. The game is VERY buggy, including sound glitches, freezing, and visual glitches (like Spyro's head getting stuck twisted backwards over his spine - amusing, but not great gameplay!), as well as VERY long load-times, and LOTS of lag in the middle of gameplay. Spyro even moves oddly, and the animation for some of his special moves - like the 'hover' move to achieve a last bit of height at the end of the glide - are downright ridiculous in appearance. For the price, I'm afraid it's just not worth it, and I feel that I was all but ripped off. The background graphics ARE beautiful, though, and the game concept obviously held a lot of potential. If you love Spyro, be sure to RENT this one - and wait for a sequel."
1,Worst spyro Yet,"Spyro Enter the Dragonfly is the worst out of all its previous releases,including gameboy advance games (Spyro Season of Ice and Fire). It takes 'forever' to load, it is difficult to control spyro, there is a lack of new characters and being able to play as different characters, like in spyro 3. There's only one boss in th entire game, the game is too short - it has only 9 levels and 1 world, unlike the previous series - over 25 and 4 worlds. Overall, I thought that the game was easy, boring and very predictable. Universal has ruined this game and its rival Crash Bandicoot (Wrath of Cortex). This game really suits PS1 rather than PS2, yeah.. The graphics may be well developed, but the playability is what counts. Now here is a note of warning: if you are wanting to buy this game, do not trust websites that have previews saying that it has over 25 levels."
2,The first three spyros are much better,"I personnaly own the first three Spyros, but I rented Enter the Dragonfly. This is a PS2 game which makes it different from the playstation games. The graphics are strange and so is the plot. There isn't as much to do in Enter the Dragonfly. I haven't played in awhile so my review isn't crystal clear. There are some neat things about this game though; there's new ""weapons"" and characters. Before you totally overlook this game, rent it, see if it's worth you're money to buy it, who knows, you may like it, my disgusting brother did. The down side to that is he has terrible taste! In my opinion he does at least. But all in all it's really not a bad game, so give it a chance first!"
2,A short disappointment,"I have purchased every Spyro game that has been released... this one is awful. Yea, okay, the premiss is the same, but this is the shortest game I have every played. I dont think I can express my disappointment with this game and the lack of worlds. I mean, after playing it for a few hours one evening I found out that I was already 25% finished. Thats not even close to providing a product worthy of the stiff price. Loading takes _forever_. I mean, every time you change worlds literally takes about 5 minutes. If you are a diehard Spyro fan and just need a fix well, buy it but please don't expect much, or you'll be sorely disappointed."
2,Disappointed,"There are bugs in the programming that cause freeze ups, parts of the worlds temporarily disappear, and it's so choppy at times that play is next to impossible. The concept is great, the places and tasks are fun, though a bit simple. I really hope Vivendi Universal can fix the bugs and recall the game so we can play what could be a fun game."
5,Classic game,Enjoyed Spyro when it first came out and had the urge to order it again. Had just as much fun playing it the second time around. Game came very quickly and arrived in good shape.
4,Understand,"I have never had these problems with freezing, glitches, and other things with this game. Also, you must understand that the game was rushed while they were making it so that it could have been released earlier. Personally, I would have took my time and attempted moreso to make the game nearly perfect, so I know it is no excuse. If you are a true Spyro fan, you may still want to play this game.It is fun and adventurous. The game was rushed so it is not top notch, but it is still a great game."
3,Spiced Spiro,This is old Spiro with spice. Cute little dragonflys to catch. More challengeing adventures.
3,Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly,"""Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly"" is one of my favorite Spyro games ,but it has some glitches and errors. One time, I warped to the home world and Spyro was invisible. Sometimes , when you try to talk to a charater ,the gmae will freeze up. Even though it has errors, it still has great levels and fun challenges. I rate this game a 3 of 5 stars."
3,ok i guess,"I've been a spyro fan since the first game.But this game is a big disapionment.WHY?!Ok i'll tell you why.The reason is that in the previous game's of spyro including spyro season of ice for gba had new boss.But this game ripto is back.Not that weak little shortey again.Anyways hear are the pro's and con'sPros:The graphics are good enogh 7,6/10The music is good 8,8/10The breath's are awsome 10/10Cons:The sound i hate itThe boss battle's are stupidNo playable caractar'sIn my saying the game is not worth you're money.If you like spyro rent the game."
1,Can I enter no stars?,"Yikes. Could this be any worse? For one, the frame rate is horrible and definitely not nearly on par with the previous three games, which, for the previous reviewer, were made by Insomniac Games, not by the company who produced (or shall we say butchered?) this game.If you're a fan of Insomniac's genius, check out their newest game Ratchet & Clank. This blows even the good Spyro games away!"
5,Best Game Ever,"I don't get it; WHY ARE THERE NEGATIVE REVIEWS??? This is probably the best game I've ever played. There isn't a thing to complain about except this, the Burning Plains were ugly. I'll admit, I may not have a legitmate review because I'm an eleven year girl who's a dragon nut. I love the flying. Yeah yeah I can't go very high, cry me a river. That's why you can flap. There's nothing to complain about, people just have to have everything perfect. If you ask me, there is not, will not, and can not be a better game. Unless they make a sequel."
2,not up to standards...,"-Why only 2 stars:I greedily bought and played this game the day it came out. I wipped through it in one weekend and never picked it up again. It just didn't lure you in like most great games.-Gameplay:You start out in a home world which has 9 other levels you can explore from there. Spyro must explore these levels to rescue dragonflies that are lost. You can drive around vehicles such as submarines, tanks, and UFOs. In addition to breathing fire you have freezing, electric, and bubble breath aswell. The graphics are amazing but they begin to get boring. Everything appears smooth and untouched. Running around and doing your dragon thing becomes routine and once you beat the game there is no reason to get 100% completed except for self praise. There are no bonus levels or special features.-Who should play:I would reccomend this game to a beggining gamer. They might enjoy the simple story line and easy gameplay."
3,Could've been better,"As a Spyro fan, I love this game!!! It's the third Spyro 4 of all time! There are new games where you get to catch manta rays, avoid dangerous pool cleaners, play the game of Tiki Drums, solve gem puzzles and play speedways just inside the levels! You start in the Dragon Realms and end up in Ripto's Volcano! The flaws are:1) The game's too short.2) Not too many characters.3) Too many glitches from freezing to walking underwater.4) Slow loading5) Shortage of the levels6) No playable characters.7) You meet Barthomelew and Bianca only once.8) It was just like a piece of garbage which was playable on the PS2!9) It's not like a real PS2 game!The game's shorter than Cardcaptor Sakura, and the game's confusing like the second tank challenge in Spyro3. There are many bugs which can never be polished, and happen whatever you're doing.This is nothing but a beautiful + stupid game!!! The good thing is that the levels look more pretty than in Spyro3! But rent it before you're buying it."
4,"Fun, but not challenging","I have not had the problems described by other players. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that this was a rental game. But shouldn't that do more harm than good? Perhaps it's because I have a brand-new PS2. But should that matter?I've never played a previous Spyro game. My girlfriend has, and she enjoys this one. My view, however, is that of a completely new player.This game has a very Mario 64-ish feel. That, in my opinion, is good. The problem is that the game is very simple, and quite easy. I'm 20% finished with the game right now (yes, I know, I'm not as qualified to write a review as some are, but here I am), and I've only been hurt once or twice. Ever.Nonetheless, the game is fun. It's well-designed, and despite the loading times (go get a drink or something!), it's been problem-free for me.Five stars for a game that reminds me of the Mario platform era, minus a half-star for simplicity and a half-star for load times, equals four stars."
4,I highly recommend it!,"Just finished paying Spyro again and it's better and better everytime. I got it for my son, but I think I've been playing it a lot more than he has. I think the graphics are great and so is the handling of the game. Some people complain about it but I don't have any complaints. My son likes the ""cool"" things Spyro gets to ride. His favorite is the surfboard. I really like the various breath choices he has. In conclusion, it's a great game. Get yours."
3,Fun Fun Fun!!!,"If you like fun-filled games, Spyro-Enter the Dragonfly is for you. He has new breath options (fire, ice, bubbles & electricity) & new vehicals to ride on. Besides the old characters there are a bunch of new ones. Also there are ""mini-games"" to provide added enjoyment. They're prety fun. One of my favorite parts of the game has to be Spyro's subtle sense of humor, it was in the other games as well. Enjoy!"
2,Ok I Guess,"Loved Spyro, in all the previous forms. While the graphics are pretty, they come at the expense of game play. First, the game is EASY! Riptoc's revenge had many tricky puzzles and skill challenges that kept the game interesting for all ages. If any of the bad guys kill you in this game, you probably forgot to hit pause. Also, 45 second loads between screens! And there appear to be at least three bugs in the game, where you are racing the bad guys, and go from fourth, to third, to third, to third... can't win and therefore will not be able to finish the game???All in all, it is intersting to play a new spyro game, but the flaws are colossal. Finish it and break out one of the PS1 games."
1,correction,"Actually this isn't from the same team who did the original Spyro games on the PS1. This one is developed by Universal Interactive.The original Spyro games on the PS1 were done by Insomniac Games. Insomniac's new game is Ratchet & Clank. You may want to check it out.So now Insomniac is competing against its original creation - ironic, isn't it?"
4,We need more games like Spyro-ETD,"Hi gamers. The new Spyro game is excellent. I didn't think it would be that great, but it impressed me. Spyro himself is animated well. When his wings move it is very realistic. The makers also created these different and unique worlds for the users to travel through. This is great for people of all ages also. I find that I enjoy playing it and so does my younger brother. Have fun."
4,Best of the best,"I really liked this game and believe that it is the best of the other spyro games. Although the game is very similar to Spyro 3 there are some really cool new features that even make it more fun. For example, the ability to climb walls, and the addition of various new types of dragon breath make this game more exciting. There are also a series of mini gmaes throughout the platform which make sure that you do not get bored. There are some minor issues like occasional glitches, but then again what game doesn't have this problem? Overall I gave it 4 stars and I recommend either renting or buying this game."
5,Stop with the constant COMPLAINING.,"I'm 10 and I'm a huge Spyro fan(bigger Godzilla fan), but its not that bad of a game. Listen. They had to rush the making of this game in order to have this game out earlier! Yes, the first game is better but give this game a break! If you're a Spyro fan, why complain about the game at all? You like Spyro, you're playing a Spyro game, so I see no reason to say ""This game sucks"", or ""This has to be the worst Spyro game ever!"". Shut the **** up!!! In fact, my game of Spyro Enter The Dragonfly has no glitching, crashing, or freezing! Gosh!"
1,i like the older spyro on ps1,why is rypto in this you kill him on spyro 2 riptos rage well ill just let this one slip after all you kill ripto like 3 times on spyro 2 but the graphics are like vegie tales graphics and riptos mouth was big and his septer looks like a disco ball and dont you think ripto isnt a real evil villan like gnasty gnorc or the wich that looks like a dinosaur i really dont know how spell her name and its hard
1,They can do better,They can do better.It freezes takes long to load and is short and simple.Do not get it.
3,Spyro Enter The Dragonfly,"Out of all the spyro video games this one really rocks.You meet a lot more people and more new fun tasks! The real main object of the game is to collect dragonflys,as you may all ready know. It's really cool you get fire breath,ice breath,electricity breath. Parents don't have to worry. It's areally okay game. I'd reccomend this to people ages 5-14yrs. old.Basicly fit for any age.The only thing I think that it could improve on is haveing good music based on each level would really improve it. Also, it could have had a better plot based on the point of each level. In conclusion, this game really is good for anybody who likes action and adventure games."
1,not worth a qaurter,enter the dragonfly sucks. theres so many glitches the load times are awful. the graphics are an embarrasement. and the characters have no personality except duh duh hi spyro. stupid lipsynching there not even moving there lipsb or making eye contact with spyro. theres only i boss. i was so upset i took this game on a trip to the trash not worth a qaurter.
5,THIS GAME ROCKS,"This game is so cool. The new characters are cool, and the old ones are still awesome. My favorite character, besides from Spyro of course, is Ripto. I mean that guys awsome. You want some fun? Adventure? Challenge, and a cool variety of enviroments? This is the game for you. Plus, the new moves like electricity, bubble and ice are awsome, but fire is still the best. Step in and help Spyro ruin Ripto's plan before it's too late. It's all up to you to defeat Ripto, AGAIN!!!"
1,Spyro - Enter the long load times.,"I've been a Spyro fan from the beginning and I was anxiously awaiting the release of this game. I bought it the first day it was released, ran home and popped it in the PS2......Yuck!What happened? If your looking for the old Spyro you won't find him here. Vivendi Universal has totally trashed the Spyro legacy. Anything that can be wrong with a game is in this one. Looks like Vivendi Universal released this game before they even tested it because as far as I'm concerned this game is UNPLAYABLE. Long load times and frame rate problems are just a few of the problems. I played this game for 10 minutes and I could not play it anymore. Don't waste your money. Buy Insomniacs new game Ratchet & Clank. It's 10 bucks cheaper and 1000 times better. FYI - Insomniac was the original developer of Spyro."
2,A Total Disappointment,Lots of frame rate problems. Several times I had to reload the game because the graphics were all [messed] up. Which brings me to another annoying point: the loading times for the levels are unbearable. The ideas were great but it looks half finished.
2,Not Much New HERE!!,"All of the Spyro games rolled into ONE, but in slower motion! PS2 games are NOT ""Faster Paced or Fast Loading""!! Just a BORE all around!!"
1,What a disappointment,"My son received this game for Christmas and we were shocked to see the quality of this much anticipated game. The loading time takes forever and there are so many glitches, it makes the game more irritating than fun. It was not as challenging as the previous games and was indeed a great disappointment. It seemed as if they started with a great concept, but rushed the production in order to get it out before the buying season. I definitely do not recommend this Spyro."
1,Disappointing,"I've said it before and I'll say it again, Universal Vivendi ruined this series for me. This game is better than the one I have for the Wii but not by much. There's only one world to explore and like a previous reviewer said, the level portals aren't named so that is a bit of a pain. Yes you do have to collect something other than gems in this one as in previous Spyro titles but mine froze quite a bit (probably got one of the earlier copies released) and the load time was annoying. I'm used to the PS games taking time to load but this one took forever! I could've gone and made a five course meal in the time it took. Okay so I'm exaggerating but as I recall the first 3 Spyro titles had quicker load times. Either way, even though it's been almost six years since I bought this game, I'm still disappointed with it."
1,Waste of money!!!,"I felt really dissapointed with this game!!I loved the others Spyro but the ""Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly"" is awful!It just had one world...come on!!!Sorry guys!!!I didnt like it!!!"
2,load longer than level,"The graphics really aren't improved enough to make up for the loading issues, nor are the levels that long. Plus these 5+ minute loading times are there not only when you go to a different world and/or level, but also when you enter a mini-game within a level. This makes leaving and coming back to something more time consuing than doing a part at that very moment because you'll load while leaving the mini-game, then load while leaving the level, and load 2 more times getting back to that mini-game. There are major glitches in the PS2 version, I don't know about any other versions. I've beaten every Spyro game, and this would have otherwise been as good as the others. I'd recommend having a portable game to play during the loads or something else to occupy that time, or not playing."
2,Freezing...and I don't mean the ice breath.,"I waited and waited until the price dropped on this game, but even the $20.00 I paid wasn't worth it. The game is WAY too short, I finished it in 2 days. The previous Spyro games took me much longer (like at least a couple weeks) and were a lot more fun.There's no skateboarding which was disappointing, I really liked that in the last game.But that's not my biggest problem. This game froze almost every time I played and the graphics would just disappear. I had it happen more than once that I would be walking around in an area and the graphics would just disappear. I could still walk, jump, etc, but couldn't see any of the environment. I'd have to restart the system and then the level. ARGH!I can't even go into all my other complaints. Let's just say that compared to the other games in this series this game sucked! (and in case you're wondering, the freezing only happened on certain levels, so I'm pretty sure it's not the disc)"
3,"Spyro is back,slower than ever","Here is my review(graphics,gameplay e.t.c)Graphics 9/10Exellent. what else can I say?Gameplay 2/10Boy,Spyro is slow. His headbash takes forever in work.The Loading takes FOREVER and if Spyro is on a edge of a cliff and you just simply turn around then...he falls down. But here is the best thing: You get to torch Moneybags! YAY!Sound 8/10The music is fine and some of the original cast is on now.This game is OK. But it's only has 1 world. Thats wy I gave it 3 stars.The Music is OK. Some of the original cast"
1,Dragonflies are BUGS too...,"I purchased this game because I am a big fan of the little purple dragon - and have played all the Insomniac produced Spyro games for the PlayStation.This was the first time Spyro was not done by Insomniac - and it shows!This game had a lot of glitches, including game freezes, Spyro getting stuck in walls due to geometry, sound getting stuck in a loop, and the background disappearing leaving Spyro wiggling around in a black void...When Vivendi Universal was contacted just after Christmas 2002, they said that they were not releasing any fixes for the game, that they had no suggestions, and that I should send the game back for a full refund. The not-so-happy ending is that I got my money back, but I didn't get my Spyro fix.This game was the reason I bought a PS2 at all. Ah well, Insomniac released a game around the same time called ""Ratchet and Clank"" which was as fun as the original Spyro games."
2,...,"I was really looking forward to getting this game. When I first learned about it, I put it on my wish list and told people about it. When I got it, I was stunned. The graphics aren't up to par. The gameplay just didn't seem as good as the old ones. I was suprised. I have returned this game..."
1,I bought a PS2 for this????,"Wow - what happened to Spyro? I can't believe that I waited two years for this disaster. I've never played a game that had so many bugs in it. Unfortunately, you can't return a game once it's been opened. If you could, the line to return Spyro:Enter The Dragonfly would be as long as the load times. What a disappointment."
2,"Glitch, Glitch, Glitch, Glitch, Glitch... Glitch","What went wrong?The Spyro games had a good reputation as being fun and challenging.This game is neither.First of all there are only NINE levels, compare this to the 25+ levels of previous Spyro titles.These nine levels are way too easy.It can take as little as Ten minutes to beat a level, thats definately not challenging to me.Now lets talk about the worst part of the game, the endless glitches.This is undoubtedly the glitchiest game I have ever played.I have played cheap ten dollar games that have not glitched so much.Simple things such as moving the character cannot be achieved without experiencing glitches.This is very unreasonable.Certain levels cannot be accessed, this is unacceptable.Certain objectives cannot be completed, this too is just unacceptable.This is a total waste of money.When you spend your hard earned cash on something, it should work.This game DOES NOT!"
4,Zesta Saltines not quite so Zesty,"Shipping Carton arrived partially opened (?), but with full order inside in decent shape (although first box seemed a little on the stale side).However, so far as the process of ordering and delivery, everything worked as expected.PS: We are delighted to discover we can purchase Zesta Saltines via Amazon. This brand disappeared form shelves in this area shortly after Nabisco (?) purchased Keebler some years ago--it is by far the best saltine among the major brands."
5,super cheap,"i installed this into the chamber of my aircannon without any problems. it works perfectly fine, no leakage and it appears to be fairly accurate. you could find a comparable valve at home depot for three times the price"
2,Double check your order,I don't know how it happened but my order ended up going through BIC without Prime shipping. After 6 days shipping I ended up with a PG100 which is useless to me. The gauge that arrived seems well made so it gets a couple of stars but BIC should get one star for delivery time and order accuracy and amazon should get one start for running it through BIC in the first place.
1,Workout Music review,I am interested in buying a Praise/worship DVD/CD but I need to hear sample music before I buy. Some music is not my style. If I am gonna jump around I need it to insprie me to do so..don't want to buy if I can't hear a sample first.
2,Cap problems,"After using this product for about a month, the plastic tab that connects the lid to the container is cracking due to the weight of the lanyard. Soon it is crack all the way through and render the lanyard useless."
3,Highly Edited Version of earlier Edition!,"This book is a fair edition of 'The Law Is for All' if you can't find the original edition that was Edited by Israel Regardie, published by Llewellyn Publications, and first printed in 1975. The edition edited by Israel Regardie is far more comprehensive and representative of Aleister Crowley's commentary."
2,disappointed,"I just started reading this and am very disappointed that I didn't find a different version somewhere. The editor of this book ""The authorized popular commentary"" chooses to not put a commentary with a lot of the lines. There is whole pages talking about stuff and then he leaves the commentary out. The reason i got this book was because there are commenaries explaining the meanings behind what crowley is saying but the editor writes he would rather leave them blank so that the reader can guess. Seriously? I bought the commentaries so that I wouldnt have to guess! I would like to punch that Wilkinson in the face."
5,Indispensable for the student of Crowley's thought.,"A wonderful aid to the layperson seeking a greater understanding of the Book of the Law, and Crowley's thought in general. Incredible."
3,Three stars are not enough,This is it. The One that puts it All together. Every religion is One who is distinctly sepparately apart. The Bees Knees to the subjective fart.
1,Huntington's children on the march,"Not at all informative, this book seems to have taken its cue from Huntington's ""Clash of Civilizations"" theory: the authors construct a model for the future U.S.-China confrontation that they almost seem to hope will come about. Although nestled in scholarly language and presented as the views of experts on China, most of the argument seems based more on stereotypes and American paranoia than any actual fact. Also annoying is the authors' assumption of the general benignity of U.S. policy in Asia; it never occurs to them to question the designs of U.S. policy-makers and businesses in the region..."
4,"Well researched, smoothly written overview of Chinese threat","Written by two journalists, The Coming Conflict is a well researched, smoothly written overview of U.S.-Chinese relations in this century. The book presents some sobering facts about China's motivations and political ambitions in the Pacific. These are facts the U.S. must consider carefully. The book chastizes U.S. businesses for essentially ""rolling over"" on behalf of Communist China for the sake of making money. Would recommend another book which talks about China's ""backdoor"" military and diplomatic relationship with the Islamic Republic of Iran called ""The Rise of the Islamic Empire and the Threat to the West"" (also listed at Amazon Books Web site). China, after all, was the nation that sold the Iranians those Stinger missiles...Interesting book. Hat's off to the two authors!"
1,A disappointing read.,"I tried to keep an open-minded perspective on the arguments made in this book but they're just outrageous. Despite the military flexing along the Taiwan Straits in 1996 (from where most of the arguments and extrapolations in this book are drawn) and the recent verbal jousts during the Presidential elections where the upsart and pro-independence DPP forged ahead, China remains to be a superpower to be reckoned and does what any other superpower would do to edge favorably. What the writers here have amassed is far-fetched scenarios and conclusions that makes it a good science fiction if it weren't terrestial based."
3,Good book but outdated somewhat,"Pros: Well written, well organized. Good strategic thinking in examining certain aspects involving S. China Sea and alliances. Excellent description of Chinese corrupt regime, and how the Chinese economy is controlled by party bosses, military and their families. TRULY EXCELLENT in showing how corporations, led by Kissinger and other former high ranking employees, ended up DETERMINING US foreign policy.Cons: It's 15 years old ... 1996-97 .... there hasn't been a Taiwan moment... deficit is actually exponentially HIGHER... China IS now in WTO and there's no mention of MFN anything...it's OLD ... good to read for strategical thinking and some China background ... not so up to the times."
1,House of Cards,"My purchase of this item was to use it in a class I was teaching on White Collar Crime. Unfortunately the presentation was biased beyond belief blaming the whole collapse of the mortgage system on George W. Bush. As someone who had researched the subject before seeing this presentation, I was well aware of the fact that this financial disaster went back to the Carter Administration and was pushed through Congress by Cong.Barney Frank, Sen. Chris Dodd and others who believed that everyone had a right to home ownership, even if they could not afford it or worked for it. The presentation clearly showed the pro-Democrat bias of CBS and 60 Minutes. And please note, I am not a Repbulican, just an objective instructor. Don't waste your time on this one. If you want the perspective on this DVD just order up Democrat Talking Points on the Mortgage Collapse."
3,Not Sure,"Im not sure what rating to give this. This is either a one star in terms of new school or an old school classic. I bought this because Prince Paul is the producer, but he doesnt even produce half the tracks and he even rhymes a little. On the ones he does produce, he doesnt sound anything like his recent work. So I wouldnt buy this album for that reason. The lyrics are very old school and pretty simple. To me most of the material ends up sounding the same, and I had trouble listening to the whole thing. There are more live instruments which is a plus, so if you like the Roots you might try this, but I dont like old school very much, so I cant say that I liked it."
3,Outstanding Production,"Meet Mary Pleasant, Mother of Civil Pleasant, a documentary on the life of Mary Ellen Pleasant is an outstanding production. Susheel Bibbs has meticulously stitched together the many fragments of Pleasant's history into a tapestry the makes it easy for the scholar or layman to understand this woman of mystery. Easy viewing and dramatic presentation."
3,"Short and shallow, but a decent resource.","Johanna Sands, Sustainable Library Design (C. M. Salter Associates, 2002)Pamphlet, more of an abstract than an in-depth treatment of the topic, now available free online from its publisher (Amazon won't let me link to it, but a Google search will bring it up pretty quick). Not bad for giving ideas about other places to look (and some great examples of the architecture in question), but light on substance. ***"
2,Tea & Etiquette: Taking Tea for Business and Pleasure,"This is a very short book with information that you can get online. There are alot of photos, a handful of recipes and some filler articles. Definitely NOT worth the price. Get a used copy if you think you must have it."
1,Was Not Helpful,"If you have post-herpetic pain from shingles, like me, you will probably try anything. This product did not help me at all and irritated my skin. Web Vitamins does not accept the return of opened products. Knowing the pain and itching, I would not dissuade anyone from trying anything and from the reviews, this product has helped some people. I would,however,try to find a vendor that will accept a return if the product does not help you. The good news is, fortunately, with time, the pain and itching is getting better. Also, a very simple moisturizing cream did help me."
4,Shinglederm to the Rescu,This product was ordered for my mom who suffers from recurring episodes of shingles on her forehead. She does not suffer from actual breakouts but extreme itching at the site where the shingles first appeared about 10 years. ago. This product works great in releiving the itching and burning sensation.
1,A Total Waste of My Hard Earned Money,"I read the reviews before purchasing this. I saw that some got relief and some did not. But, I was in such pain, I was willing to try anything.This product did nothing for me. It wasn't even as soothing as the lavender oil I had been using.'Makes me wonder if the people who wrote the positive reviews don't have something to gain from the sale of this product. It's unfortunate...but anyone can write a review.I used the entire 1.4 ounce container in four days. The only relief it provided was the coolness during application. I'm sure the aloe was somewhat beneficial. Save your money. Buy some lavender oil and some ranunculus bulbosus, which is a homeopathic remedy for shingles.If you're reading this, you're probably experiencing a lot of pain from shingles. This product does NOTHING to relieve the pain!"
3,Was hoping for more pain relief,"This product does supply a good amount of pain relief for shingles, but I was hoping for more. It last a good while once you put it on."
2,"Some pain relief, but little else.","Used it late in the course of my shingles outbreak, after blistering and scabbing. Temporarily relieved some pain but did nothing else to hasten the recovery--Aspercream has the same effect and is much cheaper, not as greasy and has no odor like this product."
1,Old watch/frozen mechanism,"The movement froze after 2 weeks because of age and a bad seal (never was near water), not able to get replacement part. Gave up after a year at my jewelers. Absolute rip off/second time I have bought sub-standard products at Amazon."
4,One of the best hip hop records without pdiddy remix chants,"When I'm not brushing my teeth with DD-7 or boosting my mellio purchasing real-estate tapes I'm listening to my stromie- my homie, the do-do man... And so starts the second side to one of the most bizarre ear candy records made by those crazy De La guys. And then of course the record goes into a brilliant cut ""Milly pulled a Pistol on Santa."" About a scheming daughter over a violating father who doubles as Santa for Macys. With other amazing cuts: A Roller Skating Jam called ""Saturday""- Afro Connection at a Hi5- Let, Let me in- and my personal fave: Keepin the Faith. A sarcastic (often slept on) second album that proved they were far from dead. Like getting hit in the head with a brick, only better."
4,Perhaps the most slept-on hip-hop album.,"Most didn't know what to do with this one. It wasn't D.A.I.S.Y. Age, but seemingly not hardcore. It doesn't fit any sub-category of hip-hop, but it has its place. I really got into it. Check out ""Oodles of O's,"" ""Saturdays,"" ""Millie Pulled a Pistol on Santa,"" and ""Ring Ring Ring."" Keep an open mind and you'll enjoy."
1,The smell is horrible!!,"I have to say that we never actually used this product. I opened up the bottle and was almost sick from the smell. When my son go home from school, I handed him the bottle and didn't say a thing. He went to take one and told me no thanks, no way!"
1,Seemed straightforward enough...,"I expected to receive a similar product to what I had purchased in the past. A small heart birth month stone slightly raised. Instead it is a small cheap piece of plastic with a huge flaw in it glued to the link.I bought it in advance of our 2nd daughters birth, and originally bought the December stone which was twice as nice as November. I am highly disappointed with what was sent.What can you expect for $10 I guess."
2,Maybe It Works Better As A Screenplay?,"Family Trust, written by Legally Blonde author Amanda Brown, was a disappointing read. The characters are caricatures, the plot predictable. Personally, I don't find humor in a 4-year old becoming a sudden orphan, nor in the tired stereotypes of Jewish Mother, Icy WASP, etc. I must admit that as a former Wall Street trader, I loved the in-jokes and name dropping in the early part of the book --thus the 2 stars.(Note to Abby Joseph Cohen--are you getting royalties from this?) However, the book never really captures the light, sophisticated tone it strives to achieve."
3,"Cute Story, hard to follow","I really liked the story, but I thought the author's writing style was hard to follow. The point of view changed so often, I frequently had to reread paragraphs to figure out who was thinking what. Flipping from one character to another in seperate chapters is interesting; doing it in the same paragraph is frustrating."
3,not completely satisfied,I got this book as a bargain and I'm glad I did since it wasn't worth the full price tag. Time isn't taken to develope the characters fully and while the storyline is a good idea at some points you fill like it was plot driven rather then character driven. I'm not even fully convienced by the love story sense they barely spend time getting to know each other in the book. The only reason I'm giving this three stars and not lower is because the writing after the first chapter is good. Some of the situations are funny and its one of the few books that has a NYC setting that I've actually enjoyed.
1,Didn't You See This Movie Already?,"This book reads like a cliched romantic comedy movie, and not even a good one. The characters are flat and unbelievable. There are some funny lines, but they are not enough to save the book. How the heck did this get published at all? The fact that the only reviews on the jacket were for Legally Blonde the movie, not the actual book, should have tipped me off to this hackish writer."
1,simply mediocre.,"This is my third chic lit book after Bergdorf Blondes and Legally Blonde. I enjoyed reading the latter so I took a chance and bought Family Trust. Unfortunately, I wasn't really enjoy reading this one. The way Becca Reinhart's life being described on earlier chapter were simply vibrant, energetic and ongoing.. I enjoyed reading these part.. but when she had to drop everything in her life and followed what Emily has to say.. its just too good to be true."
1,Don' t waste your time with this book,"I am all about mindless beach reads but this book was such a waste of time. The main characters are totally unbelievable. I was so bored with them - of course they will end up together, they had no conflict from the start! And obviously the author has little experience with children because no child happily replaces her dead parents with a couple of family friends.Don't waste your time on this book."
2,So much Fluff it could just fly away,"Becca Reinhart is thirty something who thinks about work. Edward Kirkland was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They didn't have anything in common, until they had custody of little Emily Sterns, thats when all their lives change. But some people including Bunny Stirrup don't want this new family survive and they would anything to stop it.This book looks like it would be fun. But Ms. Brown does bring any real emotions behind the characters. Many of the characters seem so fake would not act the why that did real life. It was an okay but seem to lack something."
1,Insipid and third-rate if it's possible to say that....,Uninspired story & a total waste of time!! Cheesy characters & so unbelievable that you wonder how this story went into publication.
4,Great happy-ending read!,"This was a great book if you're looking for a romantic, funny, happy-ending story! You'll find yourself smiling as you follow along!"
2,False advertisement!,"On the back of the box to this tape there is a picture of he Giant press slamming Sting from a tag team match and of Chris Jericho doing the lion tamber to Dean Malenko, but these matches are not anywhere on the tape! On of the main reasons I bought this tape is to see Sting(Wolfpac days) take on Giant and somebody else in the tag team match I heard they had at the 98 Bash! No Sting/Giant/Jericho/Malenko on this tape! The highlights of the eight matches that were on this tape are Ricky Steamboat vs. Lex Luger, Sting(old colorful sting) vs. Ric Flair,Vader vs Sting, Savage vs Flair,Savage w Elizabeth vs DDP w Kimberly(before she had all that plastic surgery done on her face and top),Savage/Piper vs Hollywood Hogan/Hart,Goldberg vs Konnan(in it's entirety) and Flair/Arn Anderson vs Mongo McMichael w Debra McMichael(before she had all her plastic surgery done on her face and puppies installed)/Kevin Greene."
3,It was OK.,"This was ok. I was expecting more from this movie. It shows the 1989 U.S.title match between Luger and Steamboat. It shows 1 year later, Sting's 1st title reign, defeating Ric Flair. Vader beats Sting 2 years later for the title. Ric Flair beat Savage on Father;s Day in 1995. It also shows Steve McMichael Joining the 4 Horseman in 96. And more. Please, do not get this movie if you are in need for a good movie."
4,WCW/NWO The Best of Great American Bash review,"The only bad matches on the tape were The US title match between Bill Goldberg & Konnan which was one-sided flop & The Roddy Piper/Randy Savage-Hulk Hogan/Bret Hart which was slow & sloppy. Other then that,this tape is pretty good. I give this tape a 7 out of 10."
1,Rip off,"I thought I was getting complete matches, but they are just clips and very fast clips at that. The matches are excellent but its like watching them in fast foward. Maybe get it because WWE will never put out a great selection of WCW matchs."
2,"too basic, but then again, not...","Although it seems to be a book for absolute beginners, it really is not. It helps to have at least some working knowledge of the Alef-bet before embarking on this book, plus there was no phonetic pronunciation guide."
4,Most Logical Learning-Hebrew-by-Assocciation Book!,"If you need to increase your practical, working Hebrew vocabulary in a hurry, this book is your logical tool. Even after I have finished studying each day's page, my memory continues associating each picture with its Hebrew name right on top of it. Throughout the day,I can easily recall each Hebrew word on its item learned that morning, plus those of previous mornings' study. This is much faster assimilation than just memorizing lists of vocabulary words. Am grateful to own and use this simple, effective tool, but, will give it only four stars due to a serious handicap: it lacks both syllable breaks and accent marks. Nevertheless, it remains a worthy investment."
3,almost too busy,I like the concept and all and I am not Jewish (maybe it is created for a Jewish mind?) but it seems like too much stuff is on the page to try and decipher.
5,Learning`,"Well it needed to have the phonetics for the letters in the book but once you figure out how things should be pronounced then your off, great book!"
1,What about Paul's Case?,"This author bothered me so much, I could only read the book a few pages at a shot. What kind of book is this? Did she actually send letters to paul Bernardo, or was everything made up? How dare she use this case as a way to display her poetry, which isn't even that good. She took a case that affected the lives of many many people and turned it into some coffee house ramblings. I see no point in this book. I see no point in reading it at all. How dare she have Pauls face on the cover in the hopes that true crime fans will buy it. I am insulted by this attempt to exploit."
1,"Oh, Good God!!!!!","Bad, truly bad, i live a fifteen minute drive from were this all happend. And let me tell you, crosbie's not welcome around this area. Paul Bernardo's a sick serial killer, his wife homolka's just as bad. That girl (crosbie) is just a little confused and obssesed me think's. Buy ANY other book on the case."
1,I Can't Believe This,"I now understand why there is only one review of this book, and from the authors friend. This book is not about anything but the author. This author has attempted to put Paul Bernardo in poetry form...GIVE ME A BREAK! There are some sick word games and even sicker pencil drawn pictures. This author seem to be just a little obsessed with this case. At times she rambles about nothing in particular, her dreams or fantasies maybe?? I wonder if I can get money back. I'm sorry Lynn,This is not personal please stick to poetry of a different sort."
3,Konami still doesn't get it!,"I was really looking forward to DDR Max but just like with previous mixes released in the US, Konami left out the most popular songs yet again! I really like DDR Max (6th Mix) in the arcades. Most of my favorite songs are missing from this version. Where is Bye Bye Baby Balloon, Ghosts, www.BlondeGirl and most importantly Cowgirl? There are also a lot of repeat songs from earlier mixes. Owning the first US mix, Disney Mix and the Japanese games, Best Hits, 3rd Mix, 4th Mix and 5th Mix, I was dissapointed with the song list. If you have only played the US DDR games, get this game! If you have the import versions like I do, I suggest looking at the song list first before deciding on a purchase. I'm waiting for an easier way to mod my PS2 so I can import the Japanese version and play DDR Max, the way it was meant to be played, as 6th Mix."
2,"Get the Japanese version, PLEASE!","This game may have more songs than its Japanese cousin but that does not mean it is better. It's completely neutered from the Japanese version instead it plays catch up with the Japanese versions. This would eventually set the stone to how American DDR versions play catch up to Japanese home versions. Yes, this version has 71 songs over the Japanese version's 44. The vast majority of the songs here HAVE ALREADY APPEARED in Japanese versions so we find this game complete and utterly useless. Yes, for every one unique licensed song this game has, there are about a dozen more found in Japanese versions."
4,Dance Revolution,"I received this game promptly, but it had a scratch so it would not play. Hastings refunded my money promptly. I am very satisfied with their service."
3,Great... but where's continuous play?,"I love DDR.... So why only 3 stars? Well, because it's not that much better than DDR Konamix. Also, it doesn't allow you to turn on continuous play. This means the dancing stops at the end of EVERY SONG in workout mode and you have to quickly select a new song. Not a very good workout..."
4,Difficult,"I played the arcade version of this game. The song selection is much bigger then Konamix's, but it is still a lot like Konamix. It shares certain songs and of course, introduces some new ones. I found the thing with holding the arrows extremely difficult, I am a seasoned DDR player and I failed some normally easy songs because of the stupid hold steps. A lot of people might like this game but it frustrated me to no end. A good point is that they did not change this one from the Japanese version. Even though it is a hard game, I still say Rock On DDR!!!"
4,good game,"this game is a very good game and i got it because i have played it at arcades and my sister also likes it. so far we have only bought the game (without the pads) and it is still fun. we plan on buying metal pads for more responsive controls and it should be a lot of fun. one bad thing about ddr max is the songs. i am a fan of fast moving steps and ddr max has a lot of slower songs. dont get me wrong, the slow songs can be very hard but i would rather play fast ones. if u like slower songs i would definitely recommend it because most of them are slow to moderate speed. even if u only like fast songs i still recommend getting it because it is a very good game and even if u do have to search for a song u like, i still think it is worth it."
5,Great Game...,"Don't listen to any negative feedback on this game. If you're a long-time player of DDR, you probably know all about the game already and have made your mind up to buy it or not. If this is the first DDR game you are considering buying, buy it. It is a truly unconventional game, and it's seriously addictive. The songs are great, no matter what anyone says, and it even gives a lot of exercise. Plus, absolutly no one likes that stupid Bumblebee song. It was awful."
4,Stomp to Japan's Beat,"Dance Dance REvolution. It caused a revolution, that's for sure. In case you don't know DDR is a rhythm and dance game from Japan. If you have seen one in an arcade (and if you were lucky enough to play one) you know how unbelievably addictive this is.Ok, there are some minor complaints from my side. First off. While I like the use of American games here, I dont like how they cut out some very popular songs from Japan that are an ABSOLUTE must here from this game. Such as ""Butterfly"" by Smile.Dk, ""Kick the Can"" and others...There are alot. All in all DDR is a great game, and I can't wait for DDRMAX2 in September of this year (2003). Before DDRMAX2 comes out, save up 100 bucks, head on over to Redoctane.com and GET YOUR GROOVE ON."
5,Bring the arcade home.,"Have you ever wanted to try the game at the arcade (or movies) where you move you feet around and hit the arrows? If so than you should get this game. You get a work out and have fun. The best part is, people arn't laghing at you if you are bad."
5,DDR Max,This game is very good for excersize and for your brain to think.You can chose any song you want from a selection of more than fifty. You can play with a controller or a mat (mats work better though). If you want to succeed in this game you have to practice alot. You have to have the skill to know when you make your move on the mat. It was really embaressing for me to play it at the arcade because it's a very popular game to many asians and everyone is surounded by you. If you do a great job everyone will be surprised!
1,DONT WASTE YOUR CASH,"I personally don't want anyone to buy one DDR game in the US. All the best songs are left out and there are so many distracting things dancing in the background that drag your eyes away from the arrows. I have to admit this is a little better than all the other US versions, but Konami is keeping the best games to other countries. Anyone who has player the inported versions would know that they are better."
5,Up All Night Playing DDR Max,"I just got this game for xmas & I play it every day! I give this game a perfect 10 on scale. Even though I'm not an expert, I am still pretty good. Even if I can't completely finish a song on heavy mode, I keep doing it anyway because it is fun! My favorite songs to do on standard are Ecstacy, Sandstorm, I Like To Move It, Dark Black Forest, Overblast, and Healing Vision. If anybody is interested in buying this game, then do so. I started doing a few rounds t about seven o'clock last night, and I stopped at 5:30 this morning. That is how much fun this game is.J"
4,Pretty dang fun.......,"After reading so many reviews praising ddr max as the best dancing game ever, I got it along with a dance pad and tried it out. At first it was incredibly difficult. I would lose every time. I've definitely gotten a lot better at it, but still can't do alot of the stuff. One of the problems with ddr max is its extreme difficulty level. Even at light mode, it takes a ton of practice just to be able to do those well. Also, there aren't enough good and easy songs to practice on. I like the workout mode, but I wish they could simply have allowed you to pick out a playlist and then let you simply dance without all the interruptions because it destroys the rhythm. But still, it's a great mode of play. Multiplayer is really fun since you can dance with another person. Overall the game is pretty good, but I'd recommend DDRExtreme. It's newer, has more songs, is more balanced, features eyetoy support and everything which makes ddr max and ddrmax 2 relatively obsolete."
5,Awsome Game,"This game is aload of fun. Although it isn't real danceing, once you get over that you will realize that this game is the greatest dance simulator ever toppling over great arcade dance games such as Pumt it Up, Para Para Paradise, and Dance Maniax. None come close to being as fun and exciting as this!"
2,Do Not Purchase!!!,"I was so disappointed in these earrings. Only one earring looked like an elephant, the other just looked like a blob of silver. I bought them as a gift and refused to give them as one. I would recommend NOT buying these at all."
1,Not pleased,"I bought these earrings as a soon-to-be Xmas gift for my sister in law who love elephants. When I FINALLY received the earrings, one of them was all distorted. I'm not going to give them to her because if I were her, I wouldn't wear them. Money def not well spent...."
4,Cute but small,"Love these as they are very cute, but they are much smaller than I thought they would be resulting in it being so small you can barely tell what it is."
2,Great earrings,"I bought these earrings as a gift for a friend and she loved them. Being sterling silver, they don't bother her ears at all. She loves all things elephant! Such a good price too!"
1,"Cute book, well executed, but a terrible idea ...","Provides, in bold-face text, for all you visual learners, columns and columns of MISSPELLED words! Bought it as a gift for my spelling-impaired daughter, who refuses to use it, as it merely reinforces in her mind all of the incorrect ways to spell words. You'd do better to have a friend or teacher spell the word correctly onto a small card, and then stare at that for a while!"
5,must buy series,This series is a great treat for fans of silent comedy. The package covers have rather poor art but inside is a small booklet with color repros of the posters and little writeups on each pic with a color lobby card repro on the back. #6 even had a surprise bonus of a Charley Chase 1 reel. He is a wonderful talent who should be better known. Well worth the price.
1,Time waster,"Disappointing film in the Casanegra series. The mixture of cowboys, walking corpses, bandits and weak attempts at comedy makes for a boring mismatch. The attempt to weave this story into a mystery falls way short and predictable. In addition, the colors in this print are dull and reminiscent of the B/W films that were ""colorized."" There are much better films in this series; this one should have stayed buried."
2,could be better,"screen is well made, the problem is when i have a big fire on the door magnets dont hold the doors closed.maybe the frame flexes or the magnets loose magnetism , i dont know but it defeats the purpose of a spark screen."
1,Mine sprayed water,"I wouldn't have mined if this dripped a little, but mine sprayed water out (where the turn valve fits into the valve body).I went to my local HD and found a shut-off valve made by the same manufacturer but this one had a push button, instead of a turn knob. You can still adjust water pressure by varying how much you push the button in. It drips very little and is only $5.50. Made of full metal, no plastic. Found it by the showerhead aisle.I figure I use half the water I used to use and you save on hot water usage too."
2,shut off don't shut off,"product was advertised as a shut off valve, tried two of them and neither shut off the water completely. amazon did give fast service and refund for these items."
5,Good Product Good Price,This is a high quality product with a very nice eye-candy appeal. the 360 degree turning radius takes all the guess work out of setting the flow. No Cons.
3,It is what it is,Simple device. Instals like another valve. It does leak a small amount in the closed position. When I attached a Moen shower head it stopped the leak.
1,bad valves,i have bought 3 of these valves. they all leaked by.made in china junk. dont waste your money.bad bad bad
2,Be Warned - a potential bottleneck in your system !,"I had purchased this with the Delta Water Amplifying Shower Head. I intended to use this valve as a ""pause"" upstream of the Delta head and a diverter to a hand shower on a clawfoot tub. I did not even bother to open the clear packaging, because one can plainly see that, although the valve body is sized for 1/2"" IPS, the actual orifice is about 3/16"" or less. At normal water pressure, I doubt that any massaging shower head would receive an adequate volume of water to even function. The ""pause"" aspect is ""green"" enough for me - I don't need my water rationed when I do call for it.This is so ""green"" that Al Gore would probably love it. Just not in his house. Maybe in the servant's quarters. (How's that for an ""inconvenient truth"" ?)Amazon would do well to include flow rate in this product description, as they do in many others. It would have saved me some trouble."
1,NOT Complete Shutoff,"Let me start by saying this is a very high quality valve for the money; great for flow control. I gave one-star so people will read this. If you are looking for a 100% shutoff valve, this is NOT it. Other reviewers claim ""total"" shutoff, but its not true (I just tested it 5 min ago). I wanted 100% shutoff so my railfall showerhead does not drip cold water on me when i'm not using it; but alas, it is not to be with this valve. i'll have to suck it up and buy the $38 valve i found elsewhere. Ugg, now to deal with returns."
3,It does the job!,"I use this product to diminish the flow of my shower water (to save water) and it does the job it was designed for, but over time the water shut off/ adjustment valve has become more difficult to use to adjust the volume flow of water emitted from the shower head. This product has been in use for over two years with no other problems"
2,Couldn't get it to stop leaking,"I installed this device easily enough, using plumber's tape as instructed, but when I turned the water back on I couldn't get the central ball joint to seal. Water kept flowing out, albeit slowly."
5,A smart purchase,"This shower control valve is great! It's so smooth to operate that you wouldn't believe it. It's nice to get a product that's better than you expect it to be. I bought two and,neither one leaks or drips.I'll never be without one of these again to save water and money."
5,Works Great.,"Nice, and shiny. The valve turns Smooth, and Easy. The one I received turns completely off. Will save lots of money on wasted water in shower. :)Danco 89171 Shut-Off Shower Valve, Chrome"
3,Shower valve,"This valve doesn't completely turn off the water for my shower head. I use it in a travel trailer, so I know the pressure isn't that high..."
4,No more water wasting!,"Shut off works great; stops flow while shampooing, conditioning, or lathering. The only thing was that it made the water flowing through it sound really loud. Now we'r used to it so it's no big deal."
4,"Nice quality, but not a full shut off","This product filled my needs for a flow reducer to save water, and it seems nicely made. As mentioned in other reviews, it does drip even when fully off, so don't expect to use it to fix a leaky shower valve. That said, it meets my needs very well."
5,Looks Great and Works Great!,"Installed on a dual shower head, so that one shower head can stay off when we dont need it. The water stays off completely. Looks way better than the push switch one. I love it. Easy install. Nice metal construction. Looks like it will last a long time."
5,Great Quality,Don't settle for plastic! This unit is very good and does exactly what you'd expect it to.
3,not 5 star,Installed the shut off value and it does not shut off the water 100% as others stated.Close but no cigar. I guess I will have to remove the shower handle main value that is stuck and replace it but i did not want to purchaste a valve remover and valve. I tried the easy cheap way and I got what I paid.
5,Perfect help in the RV,"For those with an RV, this is a must especially if you don't want to fill your gray tank to quickly! Set your shower temp then use this to pause your shower."
2,Design is defective,"I bought this item and it did not completely cut the water off. I returned it and was sent another one. It does not work either. I have a slight drip at he faucet cutoff, and this item does not stop it at all. Using it to cut off most of the water while you are showering is fine, but it does not cut the water off completely. I will have to get another brand."
3,"blew apart, the moment I put pressure to it","This is a nice heavy duty valve made chrome plated brass. you know you have something of substance in your hand when you hold. I installed this to reduce water usage in my shower. Unfortunately it blew apart the first moment I turned on the water. The valve itself blew out sideways and there was water all over my bathroom. If Danco had put in a snap ring or C Clip of some kind, on the outer area of the control knob, that wouldn't have happened."
5,Simple and Effective,"I bought this product when my wife and I moved into a new apartment with a small water heater (3 feet tall, 2 feet wide) and high water pressure, which is the perfect combination for having hot water run out in the shower after 5 minutes! I installed this item in about 1 minute, and it has been amazing! Our hot water now last 25 minutes, and the great thing is that you can still adjust the water pressure as you wish, so if you want a super strong blast of water to wash off after lathering up, just turn it to fully open. For $10, you can't beat it!"
1,Not a shut off valve,"This a really nice looking valve. It is listed as a ""shut off valve"" but that is a misnomer. It leaks through and drips when in the closed position. It is a ""control valve"" in real life."
3,Lacks Total Turn Off,"This valve was purchased to provide total turn off for a leaking shower faucet. It moderates the water flow, but does not completely turn off. Otherwise, it seems to be a quality product that will provide flow control for the newer faucets that do not allow volume control."
4,Great fit - no leaks,I was looking for valves to control my shower head and shower hose. The previous set that came with the house had plastic valve balls that leaked in the off position. I was concerned that these valves would leak too because the reviews were mixed. I purchased 2 and installed them nice and tight using teflon tape on the treads. Please to report they do not leak and they look better than my previous set.
2,"Immediately blew out the valve stem. Second one worked,","As soon as I turned on the water and turned the valve, the valve stem blew out and sprayed water in my face. There does not seem to be any means to keep the stem in place. You can pull it out with your hand. But, since most of the reviews are favorable, I ordered another one and it worked great."
3,Not bad but stuck later on,"This unit is simple and satisfactory overall with a nice chrome finish and good fit for installation. Only problem is the knob stuck after a couple of months. I was able to free it after removing and spraying some silicone type WD-40 down into it. After turning it (with pliers) I noticed some corrosion on the side of the internal ball valve which was undoubtedly the culprit. It moves freely now with more lubricant in it, but we'll see how long before it seizes up again. I'm not upset though since the price was cheap and even if it locks up again you can just use it as a flow restrictor once it's set where you like it. Plus it doesn't leak! Also others may not have this problem depending on their water quality. I'd still recommend it once you know what to expect."
2,"It is a valve, but not a shut off.","It works as a valve. I needed it wo shut off the water, but it leaves a small stream. It would get 5 stars as a valve that does not shuts off the water. However, it advertises itself as a shut of valve."
1,Dripping valve,Should have read the reviews before ordering. Item looks great but is dripping.No sure what joker desgined such thing having metal on metal to shut off water....Keep on looking for something.
1,Does not fully stop water flow - steady drip,"This valve simply does not fully stop the flow of water. I ended up with a slow, steady drip. That may be fine in some applications, but is not in others."
2,had high hopes mix didn't work for me,Love love Sahale & glad they are out of box company..personally this mix did not work for me or my family.
4,interesting,"I didn't know these existed until I went on Amazon to order the Valdosta Pecans. I decided to try some of these as well. They are not as addicting as the pecans, but are an interesting addition to salad or pilaf, or even sprinkled on Kheer rice pudding."
5,touching read,"I loved this book. I have read other books by this author and loved Theory of Relativity and appreciated Deep End of the Ocean. I was not a fan of Breakdown Lane and was apprehensive to read Cage of Stars because of this. However, I was so into this book and so enthralled by the characters, the intensity of emotion, and the accuracy of the story right down to the faith and mental illness angle. I have suggested this book to many reader friends and I find myself struggling to keep quiet so not to give anything away! It was a quick read and hard to put down. I was literally holding it in my hand as I chased my toddler around because I couldn't wait to read even the next few paragraphs! I am thrilled to have found a book that makes me think and feel on so many different levels. Highly recommended!"
2,Too Long,"This was a decent story, but the ending was simplistic, predictable and cliche. The last chapter could have been omitted. I found myself skipping over the many religious parts as unnecessary to the story. There was no anticipation in me for the next part. The book was a bit bland.The characters were shallowly built. Maybe I should try other books by this author.When I read half-baked stories by otherwise good authors, I have to wonder if the publisher isn't putting too much pressure on the author for deadlines instead of allowing time for the creative process to flourish."
5,Excellent book!,"This was one of those books I didn't want to end. Ronnie was a great character. The book really sucked you in and made you feel what Ronnie felt having her two little sisters murdered and all the grief and anguish she felt. the author really made you root for this character and made you still think about her and the story long after the last page was read. I highly recommend this book. I didn't think I would like the religious part of it, but I don't feel the author overdid that part of it at all. I think it was there to explain how everyone was dealing with the grief."
3,I think I liked it.,"I can't decide what I feel about this book. I think I liked it. I think. The beginning was very slow for me. It felt very choppy in the way she was setting up the story. Mitchard did research the LDS religion enough to put the setting of the book in a Mormon community, but there were so many things that she got wrong or were just so-so in explaining that, as a Mormon myself, I found it kind of hard to read. Once she got into the actually telling of the story it got so much better. Half way in I found myself actually enjoying the book and couldn't put it down. I thought the build up nicely done, but felt that the climax was - well slightly anti-climatic. I felt that the ending was way too tied up in a bow-ish. I really wish she would have expanded what happened between Ronnie and the Earlys' after the ""incident"". So, I have a like/like relationship with this book. It was good, but not great.Overall, I give this book a B-/C+"
5,garvina,"Don't you just love Mitchard? Her authentic characters, winning writing style and suspenseful plots make for a page turning experience that justifies the sleep lost while reading. Her gentle characterization of Mormon views coupled with humanizing mental illness and its consequences makes Cage of Stars one of those books where you feel bigger after reading it. This is one for the book clubs. I enjoyed every page."
1,This book was awful!!,"I hated this book. I rarely won't finish a book--even a bad one--but this one was awful. Not the plot--a young girl seeks revenge for the murder of her two little sisters--but the authors lack of knowledge on the family's religion sent me through the roof. If you are going to write about a group of people--DO SOME RESEARCH! She had so many wrong statements about Mormons it was pathetic. There isn't a temple in Cedar City, Mormons would not call the Salt Lake Temple the ""big"" temple, girls wear their wedding dresses when they are married, fathers don't give a father's blessing ever night and morning--they have family prayer, jell-o is such a cliché, and a return missionary is called an RM not a MSS. The list of her discrepancies goes on and on. I kept reading hoping that she would get past the religion thing and get on with the story but I gave up after 100 or so pages. I am still very annoyed, displeased, irritated, etc... by the author."
1,Couldn't finish it,"I picked this up at the local library in audio-book form. The story has promise at the beginning, but part way through (maybe 1/3?)I had to return it. Mitchard makes the LDS look like some sort of perfect fantasy world. The characters aren't believable because they are so goody-good- it is all too sickening sweet. It seems like an advertisement for the Mormon Church and that really turned me off since I personally consider the church to be a cult. I don't mind learning about the LDS, but reality is better than make believe in this case. The writing is poor and the story is run of the mill- too often the norm for Mitchard. Since there are so many great books out there, I couldn't see wasting my time on one that is lacking in so much."
2,Cage of Stars,Can't get myself to finish it because I loathe what this poor young girl is feeling and doing. The premeditation and deliberate plan to hurt these two people is horrible. I know of her loss but this is absurd. I won't finish this novel. I'm on page 215 and will go no further I don't want to hear any more of this in my mind. This book I purchased at Amazon and it was a book that was discarded by the Oradell Public Library. I know the area well. Grew up going there regularly. Couldn't believe it when I looked on the back inner cover and saw that. Well I guess someone else felt the same way I do..
3,She needs to do better research,"Gruesome and hard to read the first half. Being Mormon I was so bugged by her inaccuracies. She was wrong on doctrine, culture, verbiage - just about everything. She got the name of the church right but that was about it. It was weird that she chose to include so much about the church when it was completely unnecessary to the story. Otherwise, I thought it was an interesting idea and I liked the main character."
1,Very Disappointing,"I'm not sure where to start- from the painfully irrelevant details to the totally unrealistic murder description, this book was a waste of time. The concept of the book sounded good but the execution was terrible. It went on and on about the most unrelated details and when you get to the parts you'd think would be important, they were written in a way that didn't seem realistic in any sense. I understand this is fiction but it appeared the goal of the author was to make you feel like you could be the main character in the book. Instead I found myself cringing with disbelief for most of the book."
3,Not so good,"Cage of Stars is the story of Ronnie, who at a young age witnesses the murder of her two younger sisters. Most of the book focuses on the effects of the tragedy on her family and how Ronnie deals with it. It also introduces us to the beliefs of Ronnie's family, who is Mormon. The rest of the book deals with how Ronnie comes face to face with the killer and addresses the issues of forgiveness, redemption, anger, guilt. I'm usually a very fast reader, but I couldn't get into this story. As opposed to other books by Mitchard where there is always something happening, this book was quite slow. I didn't actually understand what drove Ronnie to go after the killer and why she dealt with her anger in the way she did. I would not recommend this book by Mitchard, though her other ones such as Twelve Times Blessed or the Most Wanted are amongst my favourites."
3,disappointed,"I never figured out what the title meant and am confused as to the point of the story. With minute details up to a critical point, it rushes to a strange conclusion. And then almost in an after thought we get the rest of the heroine's(?) life. I felt unfulfilled when she sees the young child near the end. I wanted so much more. I am curious as to how Mormons will view this book."
2,Boring!,"Okay if you are into a book that goes on and on and on needlessly...choose this book. I felt like they could have taken about 1/4 of this and omitted it. Much of it was redundant and of course, like all mushy books. The girl finds true love at the end...what else can happen to you to make you happy...a man. I love my man...but I hate romance novels. This turned into such.Supposedly this is coming out with an alternate ending....maybe it can come out with an alternate middle as well."
2,Not quite real,"This book started out fairly good, but after the murders it started going downhill fast. It seems the author didn't research the life of a Mormon very well. Nothing related to mormonism was really true. and How many parents send their 16-17 year old girl away to college without going with her to set up an apartment and find out about the school she goes to? The main story was interesting - the supporting roles were too much of a fairly tale."
1,The Babysitters Club Meets Charles Manson,Without the heinous crime this little novel very well could have been shelved as a young adult title...Ronnie is rtdiculously unrealistic...Scott Early(the grim reaper)very thinly sketched...basketball play by play...cutsie instant messaging...first kisses...not to mention painfully unrealistic college admissions...Yale? Harvard? EMT training at 16? I lost all patience with this by the syrupy ending.More than disappointed.
5,Cage of Stars,Jacquelyn Mitchard's new novel is a thought provoking roller coaster of emotions. I didn't want to put it down.
2,"She Thinks She can, She Thinks She Can ...","The author thinks she can weave a somewhat accurate depiction of Mormon lifestyle and beliefs into her story, but she can't. Instead, she lays it on thick, sloppy and loose. As an active Mormon, the story didn't flow for me because it just didn't ring true. Although she had some things right, she had just as many wrong. I felt it too distracting and annoying to finish. If she wanted Mormonism to play such a prominent role in the story she should have taken real care to get it right, if credibility is important to her as an author."
3,Great Story - Mormonism inaccurately portrayed,"I would have given this book 5 stars, because the basic story line is very good. However - there were very few things accurate about ""Mormonism"" or being a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I would list them all, but there would not be enough room. The author thanks her friend of 20 years, Kahlil Kelly, for helping her to understand the Mormon religion. This person is either not LDS (Mormon), knows barely enough about the LDS religion to have gotten the author in trouble, or was not given the opportunity to read the manuscript before it was published to help the author fix the vast number of factual errors in this story. I am saddened to read the reviews that say they enjoyed the insite into what it is like to be a religious Mormon family, as they really have no idea if they are basing it on this book. Very disappointing."
4,Edge of your seat,This book keeps you on the edge of your seat; the main character has all good qualities and you want her to succeed with the best of her winning - great read!db
5,An amazing story,"When a terrible murder shreds a family, most of the members turn to their religion and choose forgiveness. Not so for one young woman who witnessed the savage attack and blames herself. She chooses revenge and then things get wildly interesting. This is a very compelling novel, and brings up questions for each reader."
4,Cage of Stars,I love Jacquelyn Mitchard's book but unfortunately I don't ever remember receiving this book from Amazon. I'll have to search the house for it.
4,Liked the Practice Questions,"I used this book as one of my resources to prepare for the PHR. My main resource was the SHRM Learning System (which was great). I used this book mostly for its practice questions. Did I find it useful? Yes. In my opinion, the practice questions were much harder and more frustrating than what was actually on the PHR. I would answer a question and be very frustrated that the correct answer choice was so nick-picky. BUT this ended up being a good thing because it helped me ""absorb"" the information, have a broader understanding of the material in a shorter period of time, and assisted with fine-tuning my test taking skills.Yes, I would recommend this book for the practice questions and answer explanations. But I recommend doing the practice questions about 30 per day (no more than that) because you'll need the time to carefully review the explanations. Do not get disheartened if you are not scoring as high as you are on the HRCI practice tests.And, yes, I passed the PHR! :)"
2,Not very helpfull,I just took and passed the PHR and I would say that this book is not relevant to the exam I just took. The practice test contained many questions that focused on material that I never saw on the exam or saw one or two questions about. The book is more of a poorly written General HR Management textbook and not a good test prep tool at all. If you are looking for a relevant useful prep tool look elsewhere.
1,Frustrating Fluff,"This book is not an exam prep. It surprises me that the publisher even gets away as describing it as an exam prep. The problem is that the book contains entirely too much ""fluff"" and not enough specific instruction on exactly what is needed for the exam. For example, in chapter 7 under ""Exam Alert"" it gives a list of terms and names needed for the exam, but DOES NOT GIVE YOU THE DEFINITIONS! This book may be somewhat useful as a reference guide for HR generalists to use on the job, but it is by no means a useful study guide for the PHR exam."
2,If you want to pass your PHR....don't get this!,"It doesn't have the in depth core information needed to pass solely on this book. It is a good supplement to the SHRM materials, but not a substitute. It omitted a lot of info that's on the PHR test."
2,PHR Exam Prep: Professional in Human Resources (Exam Cram),"""Cram"" is the key word here. Buy the book if you have no time to prepare for the PHR and are making a last ditch effort to pass. This book is not very effective for learning the 6 key study sections needed to pass the PHR in and by itself. For those people who cannot afford SHRM preparation materials ($500+), perhaps this book can be better than no preparation at all. I seriously doubt I would have passed the PHR if I had relied on this material alone."
2,What a waste of paper!,"I was very disappointed in this publication. Poor organization of subjects, incomplete definitions, typos, etc. The author jumps from one concept to another, without any effort to provide a thorough and logical progression. What I found really irrating: the author will list 10-15 terms or concepts, indicate that it is imperative that you learn and understand them, and then provide no further information whatsoever."
1,Don't waste your money,This book was a waste of my money. Only 20% of the material contained in this book is covered on the actual exam. The accompanying CD had an enormous amount of errors and the test format has changed since the CD was created. I would encourage any potential purchasers to save their money.
2,good information BUT ALOT of typos and mistakes in the information.,"I've been studying this book for about 2 months in addition to other sources for the PHR exam. I haven't taken the exam yet but I feel confident about the information I have obtained.LIKES: comprehensive information on every aspect of HR and ""exam alerts"" that provides areas that will definately be on the exam.DISLIKES: There are SO many mistakes in the book which include typos and misprints. For example, the ""exam review questions"" at the end of Chapter 4 show answers to questions that are not related to the question. Definately a misprint on the publisher's part. Also, there are alot of small mistakes in wording here and there throughout the book. Doesn't cover subjects that are on some of the practices exams I've taken online."
3,PHR Exam Prep,"Overall, I thought this book to be excellent and would recommend it - but only as a supplement to other books. It should NOT be used as a stand-alone exam preparation for the PHR exam. There were numerous typographical errors and occassionally, this made it difficult to understand what exactly the question was that was being asked (on practice tests/review/exam) as well as in the actual body of the book itself. The other issue that potential buyers should be aware of is to make sure that their software on their computer is compatible with the cd that is supplied."
5,Great Book,"This is the book you need to get ready. The exam alerts are great and it clearly tells you were you need to get additional information. Great Read, not boring!"
5,"It's Pure and it's Urban, What more do you really need?","This CD is a must have, Including 40 of the hottest urban beats by 40 of the hottest artists, featuring the smash hit ""Beautiful"" By Snoop Dogg and Pharrell adn not forgettin Beyonce and Jay-z's catchy ""Crazy In Love""This Cd is the must have for any R'n'B/Hip-Hop Lover"
5,Gorgeous. So glad I bought it.,"This is a beautiful briefcase. It has so much room, but it doesn't feel large. It's not quite as shiny as it looks in the picture, and not as reddish. The leather is soft and strong and I know I'll have this briefcase for years. Worth every penny."
2,Simply Boring,"I love Demetria Mckinney because she is the bomb in House Of Payne. This movie is so boring I almost felled to sleep on it. The movie is taken place in a office with Demetria and her husband talking to a counseler about their marriage. The whole time in the movie Demetria is using vulgor language because she is angry with her husband about their marriage problems. The movie has a dumb storyline and should not have been made. I am so sorry I wasted my money on this movie. If you love bootleg, budgeted movies than this is the one to buy. Maybe next time Demetria because this was a total disaster."
2,Drawn Out,"This movie was not good. It was a long, low budget movie. I only watched it till the end because I didn't want to waste my money. Thankfully it was only a rental or I would have put it up for sale. I gave it two stars because I like Demetria. She act just like she acts on House of Payne but with a potty mouth."
4,sweet...and real,the couple in the story had true life relationship issues. The way that some women want to control our men by picking ang chosing their friends but never really understanding the true dynamics of that friendship.
4,dark chocolate,"Really really nice cd - beautiful, cloudy day music, dark but not too dissonant. Scottish folk melodies blended in. Reminds me of dark chocolate."
2,Just waiting,"They taste bad and are hard to swallow. Smell just like hay in the barn. But if they bring up my value at the doctor, they maybe worth it."
1,A Bing Crosby Christmas,I was very dissapointed when I watched A Bing Crosby Christmas. There was very little of his old Christmas shows and a lot of stuff I didn't care to see. If I had wanted a biography on Bing Crosby I would have ordered a biography. I would send this DVD back if I could...don't waste your money on it.
1,4 in 1 LED Waterproof Flashlight,"The battery was a round watch type battery and it was dead. The light did not work!! I contacted him and he wanted me to send it back at my expense. That would cost more that the product is worth, which is nothing. The whistle did not work well either. Stay away from this one."
4,"A collection of good essays, but not at Yancey's best","This is the fifth book of Yancey I had read within two months. Unlike his other works with clearer central themes, this book is a collection of essays loosely bound by the notion that God exists nearly anywhere, anytime in the world history and our personal ones, from prisons, collapse of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe, non violence protests of Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., to the love of the anonymous who help other humans blah blah blah.To those christians and even non christians who had not read any other Yancey book, this can be a comfortable start to know one of the most important christian writer of our time. However, for somebody like me who had tasted his heavenly fruit and become one of his fans, this book would seem a little bit repetitive of his more famous works like ""What's so amazing about grace"" and ""Where is God when it hurts"", and thus unable to satisfy one's enhanced spiritual appetite."
3,Finding God was Good,"I liked this book, however, I've enjoyed other Yancey books far better. With good reason, he concentrates on documenting historical facts & stories of people being generous and selfless and Christlike. It's there in his book title.But I thought it needed more of a ""how to"" angle. Yancey seems to have a grocery list of stories here, rather than relatable stories of encouragement & instruction. It was good, but it lacks that extra power to make it as outstanding as his other works. I give it a B-."
3,A little hard to find the unexpected,"It read like a compilation (which it is) of somewhat unrelated stories. The revised edition was an improvement. Some of the stories were interesting & inspirational, but I found Yancey's reflections on the stories and tie ins generated more musings in my mind. I have enjoyed Yancey's other works much more."
5,Great collection of essays,"First of all, I like the title of this book. So many people think that God is only present in church or at meetings where miraculous, supernatural things occur. Philip Yancey has found the presence of God in many places, from the squalor and oppression of Chilean prisons to the spiritual and moral neediness of post-Soviet Russia; from the wonders of nature to the basement from which he writes his books; from the writings of Shakespeare to the life of a little-known servant of God who lives to minister to the poor. Plus, his discussion of grace and forgiveness in chapters 34 and 35 is as good as I've read on some tough issues. Any book by Philip Yancey is not to be missed, and this collection is one I'll be going back to again and again."
4,Finding God or God finding us?,"Philip Yancey, as usual, arrives at the heart of the matter. God is not a bearded old man sitting forever in judgement of us poor mortals. He is in us and around us, in the people we love and in the people who drive us crazy! I am a Roman Catholic but I have almost all of Philip Yancey's books and I re-read them and share them with as many people as I can. God bless him!"
2,Short filter life,"I purchased the Jonathan Beauty Water shower filter in February and it lasted less than three months. It did work well for the first 2.5 months then I noticed a quick change in the dryness of my skin and hair manageability. I am on well water in the central part of US, our water is pretty hard so it would probably last longer on city water. For comparisons, the previous filter was an ewater which lasted eight months (but much more expensive)."
5,Required Reading for Bible-Believing Christians!,"One of Christianity's best-kept secrets is that the vast majority of evangelical scholars and theologians do not see a conflict between creation and evolution, which is why virtually all evangelical liberal arts colleges and universities (not to be confused with Bible colleges) teach evolution. This important and inspiring collection of essays from leading evangelicals should go a long way toward helping those on the conservative end of the theological spectrum value the contributions of mainstream science and interpret cosmic, Earth, life, and human history in God glorifying, Christ edifying, scripture honoring ways. It is consistently insightful, respectful, and gently prophetic. Highly recommended for those who are open to having their faith enriched, deepened, and expanded by a theocentric way of understanding the evolutionary sciences."
1,You send vitamin that i didn't ordered,"I ordered Vitamin WITH LYCOPENE, but you send me other formula. What happened? You MUST SEND some one I ordered."
1,JUNK,"First of all, I had no idea it was going to be so small and cheaply made. After trying it once, it broke, poof, just like that. No one can figure out how in the world it's not working, the metal inside looks in perfect condition, the batteries are new. Oh well, we've trashed it and will definitely not get the same thing again."
5,Works great,"Works great on my 100' outdoor extension cord. It's a pretty good price too, however they sell for $4.99 at your local Home Depot. If you have an extension cord, you need these, makes storing them so much more convenient. I think it can accommodate most 100' extension cords depending on how big your loops are. It may have trouble with the heavy duty contractor grade ones, not sure, but it'd be a close fit."
3,A decent enough game,"I dunno. Four days after buying this game, I'm still not sure if I really liked it. The gameplay's great, and I *think* I like the simplified magical system.The biggest problem is the ""What do I do now?"" factor. The bizarre non sequiturs, like jumping through a seemingly solid wall to get an item needed to progress. Going to random, far-away (it's a huge castle!) places looking for a key needed to get to the next section of the game (and then trying to figure out which locked door the key goes to.) It's not a difficult game, just frustrating and a little unfair, since there's very few clues provided by the game. It's like the game makers said, ""Hey, just toss em something randomly and let THEM figure it out - it'll increase play time!"" Sure, but I don't like spending my play time frustrated.The graphics are great. Sound's not THAT lame, but it's not CotM. Controls are just as good as the previous games. Ah,it could've been a classic game, had it been better designed."
1,Not the Dave Schools Slang,"NOT Slang,at least the Dave Schools band of Bellwether and More Talk..this is a group of east europeans,who do sound a little like Slang but very trite and lame. Nothing to hear-move along."
3,"Nice, but requires a certain weight","Good hook if your Gladiator gear track is packed with tools up top, so you need to hang something (for me- a broom) upside down to save space. Lowes has them for less than 5 bucks.Be aware though- if what you're hanging lacks enough weight, this hook will not hold it. I found that over time my broom started to slide downward and out of its grip. So... I had to switch it out with a heavier tool."
5,Preface to Pure Pleasure,"Perhaps the least-favored phrase in the language is ""very educational."" It conveys the joyless atmosphere of the classroom with the doubtful benefits of a Sunday School text.Thus, it an enormous pleasure to come across this book. It teaches about meaning --in both the literal and figurative senses --and is the kind of rigorous workout that one enjoys almost sensually: it is great fun!If you ever wanted to develop a writing style, this is a wonderful place to begin."
2,Products has a little bit inaccuracy,They are not bad.But 2 x Telephoto lens has center axial strain. Reduce the forcus some times.
2,"cheap lenses, you get what you pay for.","Cheap lenses cause quite a bit of distortion. If you're not real picky, will do the job at a budget price. If you want quality, you'd be better off buying something else."
4,"Works fine, great starter kit","Unless you're filming things for money, this should be more than enough to keep you busy. Some very modest chromatic aberration is typically present, with some vignetting on or two corners if the lens isn't securely screwed in. Unbeatable for the price if you just need a little more field of view or zoom for the odd amateur shot. Cleaning kit seemed like a throwaway but turned out to be surprisingly effective."
2,Opteka wide angle and telephoto lens review,I am using these lenses with a Canon HF11. I don't find them very good. The camera seems to have trouble focusing through them. I don't recommend this as an option.
5,Love it!,"I absolutely love this pullover. Well made, warm and fits perfectly. I've been very happy with my Kuhl pants, sweater jacket and this. Highly recommend."
5,Good for penny-pinchers like myself,"Cute, small and reliable for me. I love the armband so that it's not in the way as I work out in the gym. You're in control of the batteries instead of relying on some lithium battery or ""charging it back up"". Get rechargable AAA batteries. It'll save a fortune. The MP3 is really a dark/deep pink color. The color surprised me, but was a good surprise because I liked how vibrant it looked. I would suggest to get better headphones and/or ear pieces if you do more physical workouts that require a lot of movement. Other than that, I really enjoy it :-)"
4,Pleased,"I bought this mp3 player about a month ago and wondered why I didn't have one before. It was super easy to load music onto. In fact I have tried to help people load their i pods and this was by far much easier. The booklet that came with it didn't offer much help, yet I was able to figure it out pretty easy. I also love that it came with an arm band so I can exercise with it. I like that it uses a battery instead of having to wait for it to charge on a computer. It lasted a while on one battery. I would definitely recommend this product."
4,Lover of all things pink!,"Cute and easy to use. ""AAA"" battery operated, so stock up. The one I ordered came with these cheesy black headphones instead of the matching white ones."
3,Works for me and my wife,"I bought two of these mp3 players to replace some older iRiver players we had broke over the course of 7 years. These sandisk players filled the shoes just fine. We use the players for running and working out so we really only want about 1 to 2 hours of music and the ability to switch to the FM radio when our mp3 get old. There isn't a lot of extras (except if you count a stopwatch) like on ipods and many newer mp3 players but for the price and what we honestly need them for they are great. Also we were burned on some other versions that had internal batteries that didn't last long and couldn't be replaced, but that is not the problem here since it uses one AAA battery. We are satisfied!"
4,Railings,"Will try to make them work. Right length, but wrong thread. Appear to be metric or ??? Had to tap them to accept 1/4 20 for longer threaded rods because I needed longer thread to fit under the gunwale."
5,BIG WOOLY MAMMOTH!!!!,"Widespread Panic is one of those bands that really gets to the soul of music. This album reflects that in songs like Case Del Grillo and Old Joe. I was stunned by some of the differences in this album from their previous efforts. The production value of their music has increased in every release and this one doesn't let you down. The range is incredible. From slow ballads to harder rockin songs and finally Big Wooly Mammoth.The big puzzler on this album is what, exactly JB is singing in Thought Sausage.I highly recommend this band. They are incredible in concert and it's one of those shows you have to see because the album is nothing like the show.Highly recommended for all you freaks out there!"
4,Tight album!!!,"I purchased this cd the day it came out.I was not disapointed.It is a very strong studio album.As you have probably heard they are at there best live,that is true,but this album won't disapoint you.Also get ""light the fuse"" to really hear panic at their best.My favorite songs on this cd are ""down"",""little lily"",'Big wooly mammoth"",""this part of town"",""casa del grillo"",""don't tell the band"",and uhh ,just buy this album it is ... good."
3,Get some live stuff first!,"Okay, I know that I'm just gonna be re-hashing what other people have already written, but I am going to say it again to pound it into your brain. Hear WSP live! I have all their albums and hardly listen to them (even their best studio albums are lame compared to their shows). I think even more so than the Grateful Dead and Phish, both bands that recorded great studio songs, Panic is only truly great live. I suggest (if possible) to get into the tape trading scene and avoid this album because every live show these guys do is tremendous. Truly some of the best group playing I have ever heard.Little Lilly and This Part of Town are my 2 fav songs, but every song is pretty good. Entertaining but forgettable."
4,WIDESPREAD ENTERTAINMENT,LISTEN PANIC FANS THIS IS SOOOO! GOOOD.IT'S ENTERTAINMENT PURE AND SIMPLE.AND THAT'S WHAT MUSIC'S ALL ABOUT.BUY THIS CD YOU WILL LOVE IT.
2,"It's just the same, that's all.","I've enjoyed a number of previous Widespread Panic tracks (Space Wrangler, Blue Indian, to name two of about a half dozen), and so I bought this album in hopes of more of the same. I got exactly what I wanted, except I found that I didn't want that after all. It's more of the same. There's no ground being covered in this album, just the same sorts of rehashings. Imitation Leather Shoes is only reluctantly memorable if not forced pop, Big Wooly Mammoth is catchy, but the rest is dribble."
4,Once again solid,"Though this album has little chance of radio play, it is an outstanding effort from the boys. They don't play snappy, poppy songs and that's a reason why we love them. The cover of ""Sometimes"" is hot and the smoothness of ""This Part of Town"" adds a new dimension to the band's sound. The title track is catchy and has exceptional lyrics. Houser's voice blends with the music like white caps on the ocean. ""Thought Sausage"" should have been left out of this album and replaced with ""Visiting Day"". Other than than that this album is a solid investment for any long time fan. For the newbies, it'll get you started."
5,They're baack,"After 2 mildly disappointing releases in Another Joyous Occasion and Till the Medicine Takes, Widespread has revitalized itself with this CD. Don't let the fact that the album cover could be the cheesiest one yet or that they now share a label with Molly Hatchet and Warrant scare you. Except for a few tracks that were a little too heavy for my style, the CD is mostly good. I especially enjoy Little Lilly (#1), Down (#7), and Casa Del Grillo (#9)."
4,Yet Another Joyous Occassion,"Widespread Panic continues to explore and expand in this, the band's seventh studio album. Even with the band's incessant musical growth, all of the hallmarks of the past albums remain. Couple concert favorites are here, including ""Big Wooly Mammoth."" My early favorite is ""This Part of Town"". Personally, I can't wait for more WSP live albums (and DTTB does come with a great bonus disk of live tracks), but I've yet to be disappointed by a WSP studio effort. Only drawback is that the studio albums leave you craving a jam. On the whole, another tremendous effort. So glad that someone out there is still committed to making great music. My thanks to the boys in the band. Can't wait to give this album another listen, and another, and another ..."
4,"Cool, but most of us had this in September","Cleaned up versions of the ""studio"" album leaked last fall + a studio version of ""Sometimes"" and the new tune ""Don't tell the Band."" Overall good album for those who do not have a boot copy."
3,not as good as earlier albums,"When I first bought ""Don't Tell the Band,"" I knew to expect something different. In an interview, lead singer John Bell said that this album was going to be an exit from what they are used to doing, as well as what their fans are used to hearing. ""Big Wooly Mammoth,"" is a solid jam, but most of the other songs just don't stand up to their past work, which is five stars. If you're a Spread-Head, you already have had this album for months. If you don't have it, I would only buy after getting their earlier work."
3,Could be worse,"Not necessarily ""bad,"" good songs on here for sure, just definitely not up to the band's previous studio efforts...especially considering how strong it's predecessor was."
3,More Honest Tunes,"Another WP studio album means more WP fans complaining about how the band has changed since its Space Wrangler days, and how only the sellouts still follow the band. We have seen this before with bands like Phish, Dave Matthews, and Blues Traveler. In my opinion it is good to see a band go through changes musically, and incorporate new styles into their craft. While ""Don't Tell the Band"" is not my favorite WP album, it does have a lot of enjoyable tunes on it. From the sinister ""Imitation Leather Shoes"", to the toe-tappin' ""Big Wooley Mammoth"", it adds to The Big Panic Picture. If you haven't been a Panic fan before, this album will not make you one. If you are an old fan of this band's big sound...how can you pass it up."
5,Excellent material for any level trainer -,"This book is concise, easy to read and has content that will help you pass your CompTIA Computer Technical Trainer examination. It is useful for anyone, from someone who has decided they want to be an IT Trainer, to someone who is a seasoned trainer. Some of the examples used might be dated but they are still relevant in today's day & age. This, along with some train the trainer classes, and some additional Toastmaster's sessions can help someone be a versatile trainer in any environment. I highly recommend even teachers who start out should read this material as a lot of it is how to interact with customers and students in a professional manner more-so than technical material."
4,Helped with CTT+,This book went out to the middle east to help some of our folks get certified in CTT+ and worked.
3,Unanswered Questions,"The pictures were nice and the book contained good, general information on Corgis but didn't get into much depth. I had questions that were left unanswered. It's a nice overview, but not enough detail for my purposes. I ended up getting Pembroke Welsh Corgi by Susan M. Ewing. I highly recommend this book, it was clear, specific and detailed. Got a whole lot from the chapter on types of dog food. Incorporated the information for my two Corgis. It was very helpful for my son's Austrian Shepherd, because she has allergies and this pointed us in the right direction."
4,A good starter book for Corgis,This book is a good size for taking with you to read. It provides basic information about corgis and gives a general idea of what to expect from Pembrokes and Cardigans. I wish it had gone into a little more detail on how to care for the puppy. It has lots of pictures that are great. The special section on understanding your corgi seemed a little vague but was quite informative. This book is a good place to start if you are thinking of getting a corgi.
3,Not Everything I Was Hoping For,"This book was informative on generally on how to care for, train and breed a dog. It explained the history and physical traits of the two Corgis,and had many great photos. My main problem with the book is that it did not go into details of the behavior and personality of Corgis. Already being the owner of a Pembroke, my hope for this kind of information was my main motive for buying this book. Overall, this seemed more like a book about dog care with some Corgi topics included rather than a book devoted to Corgi specifics. Still, the price is reasonable,and the book easy to read and reference. If you are a new owner of a Corgi, or looking to get one, without any dog info book yet, you should be satisfied with this. But, if you are looking to get a more detailed account of Corgi personality and ability, you may not be. I have not read any of the other Corgi books, so can not compare."
5,Amazing system for the price!,"Don't look any further if you are looking for an affordable compact system with quality sound. Don't go spending an extra $250 for an Onkyo, it's not worth the difference. The bass on this system is impressive and the tones are clear and crisp. The 5 disc changer is quiet & effective. It also has a rear audio jack for a direct ipod connection. It generates enough volume to fill a large room well without sounding distorted. Plus it looks great - a sleek design that doesn't look cheap. This unit would still be a good value @ $300."
1,it broke in 3 months!,"And this was not due to rough handling or anything - it was just sitting on the shelf it had been on all along, playing music at a holiday party I was having only several months after I purchased it and the sound just stopped. I tried several times to get it going again and it would always stop playing (even though the CD was still running) after a couple of minutes. When I can get it to play, it skips alot. Yes, it had great sound when it worked for such a little player, but what's the point when it so rarely plays? I would recommend making another selection."
3,Wrong item,"Looks like I may have ordered the wrong item. Was looking for Pet-Tabs Vitamin Supplement. My puppy will not eat the Calcium tabs, but my older dogs does. Have ordered the Pet-Tab Vitamin Supplements, that are one back-order, and will wait for those to come. Will not order calcuim again because they do not have the vitamins and minerals in them that the Pet-Tabs Vitamion Supplement does."
3,Need to make these for small dogs.,Good tabs and vet recommended but trying to cut in half is a pain. Would like to see these with a cut line.
2,BLAND,"I thought this book was par at best the charecters were over emphasized. The whole plot is too unbelivible, (the main charecter just happens too fall in love w/ the same people wh tried too kill her previously, yet the tourture scenes had given a good visual and the villan was smartly chosen , but in the end just ends up too bland and seems like a carbon copy of a short Tom Clancy novel, alright if you're a spy,CIA,espionage junkie otherwise you can read if you have nothing else."
3,serves as good background dance culture,"i have to be honest, this album disappointed, but it can still be thought of as a good background of music culture. LFO, along with Depeche Mode and Kraftwerk were large inspirations to many good acid, house, and trance acts. Check out Empirion or Hardfloor instead. any quabbles or suggestions, give me an email."
5,Historical techno album,"Today I still listening to only 6-7 of the hundreds of techno and electro CDs & tapes I've had these last 15 years: LFO's Frequencies is one of them. A historical album, one of the decisive european's techno scene kick-off in the early' 90's.Still so fresh and actual today too, I'll keep on listening to it for some years, no doubt."
5,"Greatest Freestyle Group, Greatest song's",With all the reviews I was surprised to find no track listing with song time lengths. The original of these songs appear on their Scars of Love and Louder than Love albums.I would think think that the originals would be longer except for Maria which is the extended version.1--- One Way Love 4.102--- Come Get My Love 4.353--- Scars of Love 3.584--- Tears May Fall (92 Remix version) 6.075--- X-Ray Vision 4.346--- Don't be afraid 4.547--- You Are the One 4.108--- I won't Give up on You 4.459--- Crash 4.4910--- Give your Love to Me 5.0611--- Louder than Love 4.3212--- I can't help It 4.1213---Is It Love 4.3514--- Maria 6.57I hope that is helpful.
4,Good purchase,Very good book.good binding. Like the author. Purchased for a grand kid. Had it sent directly to them. I am satisfied
1,This is a photocopy of the book,"It's a photocopy, and not a very good one. The images are much less clear than in the normal print version, and the margins are large (which may be good for notes, but these are excessively large!).Suggest you get the genuine version which has a yellow cover, didn't feel this was worth the money."
1,Bad copy,"If you're looking for a decent copy of this book, pick a different version. This one (or at least the one I received) was clearly photocopied from the original and then bound...cheaply. The pages are strangely over-sized, and you can clearly see the photocopy marks on each page. You should just pick a different copy or a different retailer."
1,This is not Le Corbusier's book.,"What imbecile chose to put a photograph of buildings on the cover of this book that would have horrified Le Corbusier, and what imbeciles approved that decision, should be the stuff of publishing legend.When the cover of a book is completely antithetical to the author's premise, it is not that author's book."
3,Ok if Architecture field of class,Not a very exciting read and a little hard to understand. If you are an architecture major or have an architecture class it should be helpful and probably a good book.
3,give me a break,"the old jeanneret is a purist with a machine aesthetic yearning to become a calculator.there's nothing wrong with public plazas.stop repeating yourself. you're not fun to think about.architecture is plastic and experiential, but not dogmatized by universality, so stop critcising utopian solutions for lack of ingenuity."
4,Confessions of a Small-Town Girl,"This was an interesting book. I liked how it basically stayed on one plot during the whole book. It kind of reminded me of Nicholas Spark's books. I really like the ending, and I was entertained the whole time.This is definitely not recommended to young readers. (probably 13+)"
4,LA Punk: The Glory Days!!!,"Great Document of the LA punk Glory Days! Great Pictures, Anecdotes and Attitude about this Scene of the true spirit Rock'n'Roll. Only Four Stars, because it leaves you Hungry for More. It was originally a book to accompany a Gallery show of the Scene. The Bands and characters are all here. X, Screamers, The Germs, etc. I actually have yet to find a book about LA punk that I haven't loved. Keep 'em coming!"
4,"New book, great service",The book was new with no marks and came straight away to me. The cover was great too. The service was excellent and definetely worthed buying it.
4,Fairy tale that makes sense,"This book must have recently been reprinted. A while ago, when my tattered one fell apart and I tried to replace it, none were available. So now that they are - grab one fast, before they run out!A very readable, sensible, fairytale... sweet pictures, (you really can read them to toddlers) which clear explanations of Transational Analysis, but more to the point, it describes feelings and behaviours to small children (and their parents) in a way that makes sense.It's very good about describing negative attention getting and why people do it, and what we can do about that, and also about feelings in general. Mine literally wore out, and I'm very pleased to see it in reprint.cheers, amf001"
2,A real roller coaster ride,"I had already read Breach of promise and hurried out to find Angle of Impact. I sent in the coupon in the back of the book and was thrilled the other day when my autographed copy came in by Federal Express. I am usually not lucky enough to win and I consider thi a real win! Gotta go now, my new book is waiting and i can't wait any longer. Ev Alvis"
1,Boring,"I know a lot of people seemed to like this book, but I just couldn't get into it. I managed to finish it, but I do not recommend it. Boring plot, boring characters. Very little suspense. Don't bother with this one."
3,Hooded Sweat,"Nice ,But was missing the hood draw string !Not a big deal for me, but, for 30+ bucks it should have one !!"
4,Freezing cold ambience,"I'd heard several tracks from Octagon on various Hearts of Space programs, and had to get it. The music surrounds and envelops the listener, but remains very cold and distant. Several tracks follow the same mold - a series of chords that is repeated, and at each repetition you hear new electronic sounds, building and building throughout the piece, then fading out at track's end. I like it, but it makes some of the music a little predictable. Frozen East, Ashes, and Beacon are standouts. The rest of the CD holds up as well, but I wonder if this could have been distilled to 1 CD. It's still worth it.As you listen, your mind will conjure up images of bright sun and cold, cold ice. It's gorgeous music, but it is dangerously chilly."
4,journey to enlightenment,"Wearing's remarkable sense of humour and love for the human race make this book a must-read. Especially at a time when North American's perspective of Middle Easterners is tainted by the sensationalist media, Honeymoon in Purdah is a refreshing unbiased view of Iranian culture and life. Unlike so many ethnocentric North Americans, Wearing views people as people, and because of this the reader is able to appreciate the foibles and intricacies of humanity in general."
2,NOT THE BIG DEAL YOU WOULD EXPECT,"I expected the adventures of these Canadian tourists, (Alison and Ian), to be a thrilling story, but ended up with a charred piece of meat. The story was poorly coordinated. Some earlier narrated issues, which were revived over and over again instigated boredom.Also, the adventurers made no effort in detailing how a typical day in Iran looks like, instead they were exacerbating on how they took (unfair) adventage of their host's hospitality and trust.In a nutshell, this is not the book to look for, if your interest is to know more about the Iranian culture. It is just a piece of volatile fun (for those thatit will amuse).Not something that I would recommend with enthusiasm!"
3,A sometimes hilarious view of Iran,"This book had me laughing out loud in parts, and it is definitely engaging enough to keep a reader through to the end. Still, I did have a few qualms with Wearing's writing. The first is that often I had only the vaguest notion of what place she was in, and the book had no particular map or chronology of how she jumped from town to town...I know she may have smoothed things over to improve the narrative, but it would have provided a nice framework to the book. Likewise, poor Ian appears to be a whining brat...I'd like to have seen more about what exactly he was doing when his ""wife"" was off on her adventures. Nevertheless, I do recommend this book as worth the short time it takes to read!"
2,nonsense,"The Amazon review says ""she dons a black cloak, scarf, and chador (the full body covering required by Shiite Islam)"". I don't think so. This is nonsense. If you have a chador (the all-encompassing unstructured garment that most westerners can't manage) you don't need a black cloak and scarf as well; you're covered. If not, you do need a cloak (black unnecessary) and scarf. You don't need purdah...the title is a slander. (Purdah refers to covering your face and/or being required to stay indoors so your face is not seen. The word literally means 'curtain'. This is NOT required in Iran, and on our own trip we saw women going everywhere, talking easily to foreign men like myself, and generally living a freer life than in any other Muslim country.)"
3,Interesting honeymoon travelogue with a twist...,"This is an interesting travelogue by a Canadian lady who has to have ""husband"" (I won't spoil the plot here!) to travel to Iran where, she says, you can not share a hotel room if you are not married. In my personal experience (as of 2003), this is true for Iranians, atleast officially, but not for foreigners.Be that as it may, Wearing offers a good glimpse of everyday life in Iran, meets a lot of people and talks to them, so this is a useful travelogue to meet, through her, parts of the Iranian society one is unlikely to hear about from abroad. Iranian hospitality and friendliness permeate this book, and I was able to verify this myself. Same for the rudeness of some officials in uniform. All is all an entertaining account, though at times the book loses its pace and I found myself putting it down."
2,gave it a shot but it did zip for me,"Maybe it was the writer or writing style but I honestly tried. I just got bored after a while reading about these endless non-adventures and uninteresting people. I get the whole premise pretending to be married and on a honeymoon to access Iran in a different way but I just did not get any strong magical mystery tour type feeling at all. It's not like I have not read books about Iran (I highly recommend Persian Mirrors by Elaine Sciolino) so I had some familiarity going in.Anyway, Alison Wearing is probably an acquired taste as I just found her writing blander than bland."
2,Not that great after all..!,"Well, I bought this book with the intention of knowing more about the Iranian culture and the country itself. But it was not to be.The chapters are disconnected, repititive and very boring..Should be more careful with the reviews..."
1,"No, No, No","When I first saw this book I thought it would be a delightful travel monlogue with a lot of good writting, new sights and sounds and a fresh perspective into a country that has long mystified me. What I got for my money was a dull political diatribe against the western world. Granted Iran has received plenty of bad press but this author seemed determined to drum that point home at every opportunity. I found her attitude that all of the folks she met were good and loving people who she should trust with her life to be very distrubing. She showed an amazing lack of commen sense and put herself into life-threatening siutations (playing cards with a drug dealer!) with out any thought of the consequences. I am most sorry that I recommended this book to my book club. I am lucky I escaped with scalp."
2,Disappointing.,"I had been really looking forward to reading this book. I was sorely disappointed. I found Ms. Wearing's descriptions of her travels to be confused and highly repetitive. I actually found myself wondering if she was even telling truthful accounts. I also felt her behavior at certain points was out of line (jumping in the water in her chador) and disrespectful of Iranian culture. The cycle in this book is as follows: arrive at town, meet new person, take advantage of their hospitality, recall lengthy dialogues about Iranian revolution. I gathered very little information about Iran other than that its people are kind and generous, even to this seemingly undeserving Canadian tourist. I do look forward to reading more books on traveling in Iran, but hopefully better than this lousy one."
2,Cheap product not long lasting,I bought this from store and after few days only pan has started loosing it's coating while I never used these cookware in dishwasher and used tools which were with the pack.The red paint is also not stable. It started wearing out soon. Only good thing about this product is it's Silicon grip.I did contact the manufacturer for the warranty and they asked me to ship it to them with pre-paid return shipping. They'll analyze it and then ship it back (new or older depending on the condition). Are you kidding me shipping of both side almost 60-70% cost of this product and then no guarantee if it'll stay longer.I'll suggest you not to buy this cookware.
1,Waste of money!,"I HATE HATE HATE this set. I've had them for 8 months and the teflon is peeling and the non-stick surface sucks! Everything that I seem to cook always sticks the pan even if I bathe it in PAM, oil, butter you name it. They suck and I will never purchase these again!"
4,Good and easy to use.,"The lid doesn't have the little hole on it. The lids doesn't fit the frying pan either. It would be nice if it does. the pot is made in China which was a little bit disappointing, since it didnt indicate where it is made on the description. Over all its good, and easy to use. Everything looks big in the picture, but in real life it is not so big."
2,misleading,"It is NOT T-fal. GetaGrip is a Wearever/Mirro product. Do a web search for GetaGrip 10 piece set and you will see. Some sellers, on here and other websites are advertising these as a T-fal product, but show no box....just product, and NOWHERE on the box mine came in does it say T-fal. If you want REAL T-fal, look elsewhere."
2,misleading,"The cookwear advertised was T-Fal. When received it was Mirro. If I would have wanted to purchase a knock-off generic brand, I would have purchased a cheap set from a local Walmart. I am very, very disappointed in your advertising of this product. It should have been a T-FAL product PERIOD!!!!!"
1,"Great looking watch! Terrible on wear and tear, not suitable for daily use.","Ok, this is my wife's favorite watch, maybe she likes it too much. It was a beautiful watch when it was new.Unfortunately, the build up of wear and tear after only a few months of daily use is unbelievable. The chrome on the bezel is marred in several places and the accumulation of tiny scratches is alarming. The bezel has come loose and spins freely like a wheel on a game show. The chrome accents on the band are badly scraped.We own several watches in the same price range and have never dealt with such soft materials (maybe it's made of solid white gold). I know this is not intended to be a rugged piece, but the rapid buildup of damage is unacceptable. Avoid this watch unless you intend to wear it only occasionally.No problems with the functionality so far, but I'll never buy a Tag again."
5,Elegance,"First major watch purchase (over $1000) for the wife. She was overwhelmed and it was the same watch at a significantly lower price. Shipping was great but make sure you can track your $1,000+ watch. Love the Tag and so does she. We've had it 4 years now and no problems and she still gets compliments."
5,The Faces re-release 2006 tour,"I bought Faces, the 10 May 2006, After the Shawn Phillips show at Le Theatre Petit Champlain in Quebec City. The Faces CD is more than beautiful, it is simply great! All I can say, get Faces re-release, it's worth it. No Category, his last CD is very good to. Shawn is ON-TOUR be sure to catch Shawn in the FACES re-release NO CATEGORY 2006 tour! Shawn Phillips is the best 12 string guitarist he'd ever heard. Shawn is The man and his music lives on. :o)"
4,Not quite as it appears in the advertizing photos,"Not having worn this shoe for any length of time, I can only surmise that it will be as comfy as it feels now. My only disappointment was, once I received the shoe, the squared-off toe is broader than it appears in the online photos. That's the problem with buying online -- there's nothing quite like having an item in hand.Also, I'm glad I read the online reviews from prior customers. As a consequence, I bought a size smaller than normal and even that feels a little loose. Being a loafer, I hope I don't have problems with it slipping on my heel."
3,Ecco Men's Moc,"I have had these Mocs for about two years and they have been very comfortable.A big part of the comfort is because the leather used on the uppers is very soft and supple.However this also means that those areas which get a lot of stress such as the heels,toes and side stitching are not very hardwearing.The upper rim of my heels have worn completely through and I can no longer wear them.The soles are very durable.I would recommend the manufacturer use a different grade of leather or alternate material on those areas of wear."
3,Size ran large,"I have worn Ecco in other shoes and sandals with no problems, however the driving moc ran a size large and was returned to Sheoemania for a size smaller with my picking up the return cost. Shoemania issued a credit to my credit card and did not send the size smaller. I have surmised that when it comes to driving mocs, I am better off trying the size at a store."
2,First Pair of Eccos to Disappoint,"I'm a big Ecco fan, and have been buying their shoes exclusively for work for the past few years. This was the first pair to disappoint.First, the color of the leather as received is much duller and browner than the somewhat orange sheen that shows in the pic.Second, they lack the signature comfort of previous pairs of Eccos I have enjoyed, although that may be due to the fact it's a loafer and not my more typical Helsinki or Seattle slip-ons.The stitching is also more pronounced than the photo shows and than is typical for a loafer, making them look more casual than you'd expect.Finally, the latex sole at the front is already starting to show the first signs of separation of the shoe. So this pair do not appear to be nearly as durable as other Eccos.Sorry to be a party-pooper amidst these other glowing reviews, but this is my honest opinion, and in this case I think you get what you pay for, i.e. a cheaper Ecco offering is in fact cheaper."
5,Brody Text Review,Needed this book for the LSUS Master's Program in Human Services Administration. Got it very quick. Text in MINT & EXCELLENT condition and at a great price! Would've paid alot more at BAM or other vendors. I'll order from amazon again in a heartbeat. Brody is an excellent author and amazon's price and timing was the icing on the cake!
2,Not A Good Show,"I was very disappointed with this DVD - They do the wha-wha with the trombones, the wha-wha with the trumpets, a couple of vocals, a long drum solo. Frank Wess and Thad Jones have uninspired, to say the least, solos. Certainly not typical April In Paris Basie. - Duke Ellington on Jazz Icons is better."
5,CLASSIC BASIE AT HIS BEST,This is the Atomic band of the late 1950's early 60's which was the most dynamic of all the Basie groups after 1950. The relaxed swing with the explosive fills and breaks of Sonny Payne create an exciting tension that only Basie had the recipie for. The DVD is a great find and very special for fans of big bands. A beautiful presentation fitting the royalty of the subject.
4,The Swing Machine,"This is the Basie band at its best, missing only Eddie Lockjaw Davis. It swings and it roars. What a glorious memory. The film quality of this DVD is excellent, as is the sound. The performance is marred, however, by a dreadful vocalist, Irene Reid, and by an overly long Sonny Payne drum solo, complete with stick juggling and fumbling. Basie came from an era when people expected to be entertained.Don't miss this one, jazz fans. The swing machine will help you remember better days."
5,classic fighting,"if you love classic 2-d fighting games. this game will definately suffice. not overly original, but top notch none the less. this is precisely what you'd expect from SNK."
2,no on 808,"I understand this is supposed to be classic, and they were a groundbreaking project..... but really....... it's just unnecessary noise."
5,Harlan County is TRUE,"Growing up as a ""coal miner's daughter"" in Ky myself I can assure you this is spot-on accurate. Mining in a KY small town is often the only means to successfully support your family. My father worked in a union mine and after as a ""company man"" but even union strikes were frightening and often violent as so much was at stake. We were often shipped off to another town for safety while my dad would guard the house. This was in the mid 70's as well.I admire the accurate depiction of the people in this documentary. I expected them to be depicted as sterotypical uneducated southern rednecks and what I saw were wise, passionate and well-spoken (albeit with a southern drawl!) The WOMEN were amazing and fearless. Would love to see a followup to what has happened to the town and the people 30+ years later."
3,Good,Good but not great I lived in Harlan Co. Knew some of the people in the movie Buy any thing about Harlan
3,"Brookside, Coal Strike","I was born and raised in Brookside, Ky. Many of the people in the film, I grew up with.My father and their fathers were hard core Union men. *Harlan,County USA* could not touch the blood that was shed previously to the 1973 Eastover, mine strike.The film glossed over,the miners and focused to much attention on the roll women played.Fighting with sticks and switches.In the 1930s Machines guns were the miners choice against scabs and gun thugs.The film with all its historical content,will find its place in history.A good film for people who are not familar with the true conditions of life in Harlan, County."
4,Nicely done,"This takes a healthy dose of suspension of disbelief. The heroine falls in love at age 11 (Ok, a mature almost 12) with a hung-over 21-year-old boy off to war. He comes back 7 years later quite hostile toward the chit. Why? Because she's pretty! Such are the frail barques of romance plots. OK, so the story is a bit tenuous. And there is way too much made of her unexpected beauty. But the characters are wonderfully drawn, and the plot developments are not so melodramatic as they can be in the hands of other authors. This author puts me in mind of Mary Jo Putney, only better."
1,Unappealing,"Bancroft can write, and I enjoyed her other books, so I have no idea what she was thinking about when she wrote this one. None of the characters are either logically developed or consistent and, other than the main protagonist, the Lady Silence of the title, none are particularly likeable - certainly the Regency world would have been better off if the brother had been made the male lead, and the `hero` had been buried in Spain rather than returning to England to alternately abuse and bully the heroine."
1,Dreadful,A complete waste of time; tediously melodramatic. The characters are poorly developed and Farr is an abusive jerk. I couldn't even find any sympathy for Katy Snow. She just seems whiny. I don't think I'll bother to finish it.
2,Been There; Done That,"You know how people say, ""Stop me if you've heard this one before.""? Henry Slesar's ""The Thing At The Door"" should have on the first page ""Stop! You've already read this before."" I read the novel in a Detective Book Club reprint -- the DBC selection committee must have had an off day.Very rich heiress approaching 21st birthday when she will get control of the dough (Sound familiar?). She hears mysterious noises. (A) Is she really going crazy; or (B) are the trustees trying to get her declared insane so that they can keep control of the money; or (C) are some scheming relatives setting her up death? (Sound even more familiar?) [You know some day I'd like to see a writer choose option A but rest assured that's not the case here.]The rest of the story is predictable. Characters are typical of the gothic-suspense-romance genre. The damsel in distress is about half a notch brighter than the typical Mignon Eberhart birdbrain, and the villian isn't half bad."
4,A must!,"I don't know how many of this book I have bought by now...for myself and as gifts. I works. No BS. Just do it and have your life transformed. Amazing she is not more well known with teachings like this... Only reason for not giving it a FIVE star with exclamation mark is due to the paperback version I bought...does not have glossy paper and nice colours. But as far as the message goes. She has tapped into a TEN STAR information! And relays her insight very well. You'll have to be a complete idiot to not understand how to do this after she has explained to you. Works WAY better than any ""The Secret"" video/book etc. Just don't use this book unless you are serious about changing your life...as it has proven scaryliy fool proof for me..."
1,Not as impressed as I was with her Creative Journal book,"This is simply coming across as a rehash of what she has discussed in prior book called The Creative Journal. This is more focused on creating a collage, and I quickly lost interest. I'd rather deal with more writing and drawing exercises, that's just me."
5,Bringing Your Dreams Into Reality,"This new 272 page road map could be one of the best ways to bring your hopes and dreams into being. Lucia has much experience in the ""artistic design"" area and translates this skill, knowledge and experience into useful everyday methods to help us get what we want out of life. She leads the way to help us turn our ideas into reality. You'll learn how to chose a theme, gather the images, find order in the chaos, commit your vision to paper and glue, get feedback from others, dwell on your vision, get help to implement the plan and celebrate your final result. She offers detailed methods and exercises to help you work through this process, step by step. Some of her methods can provide you with amazing results. A knowledge of art or abilities as an artist are not important. She'll help you bring your latent art talents into useful actions to help you get what you want out of life. A very intersting, fun read that everyone can benefit from."
3,Just what was promised,"Shipping was fast, the sizing was correct and for the most part the item is as described. The open crotch doesn't allow for much practical usage - as in it's easier to use the bathroom after removing most of the bodystocking. Other than that inconvience it was just fine for the price."
1,Not What I was looking for,"I was looking for something supportive, this is NOT it. Should have known from the one size fits all. The Capezio body tight is the way to go."
3,Looks good,This stocking fits nice. Just wish it was a little tighter. But other then that looks sexy. My hubby liked it so thats all that matters. What doesn't a guy like anyway? LOL!
4,Deju Vu,"Much like theElegant Moments Plus Size Seamless Fishnet Crisscross Back Bodystocking Style 1611QI purchased for my girl, this is a classy little number that looks great on her, but keep in mind that anything more than a delicate wash cycle may rip or tear it after a while."
4,I liked it,"As an Eno fan anything that comes up with his name on it, either as a composer/performer or as a ""tributee"" catches my attention. I am glad I bought this album as it shows that Brian Eno's music is very robust. It survives the interpretation by other musicians. Actually, most of the pieces on this album are great. I listen to this CD very often. If you are thinking about buying this, why not get Bang On A Can's ""Music for Airports"" (another tribute to Brian Eno) as well. Different style but just as great."
2,ignore this,"Even taken on its own musical merit, this lp doesn't hold its own versus what kids in the garage are doing these days. While I appreciate the concept of an Eno tribute lp, this lp does no one-Eno, the musicians,(including Helios Creed, Chrome, and Controled Bleeding, to name 3) the listeners- any sort of justice at all.A prime example of an lp to avoid like the plague, this ""tribute"" is a tribute only to the wizards that got people to buy this."
4,The Best Textbook I've Ever Read,"I originally purchased this book for a college course; now it sits on my bookshelf, never to be resold. I rarely have enjoyed reading for my classes, but this book not only captures the heart of the female struggles throughout history--it gives examples of the women who lived them.This book presents the reader with an in-depth analysis of women's traditional roles and their active fight for change while explaining the conditions that determined the feminine experience in different historical periods. But the best benefit of the book was actually learning, and realizing, that the world that my generation (the 20 somethings) was born into is radically different from that of females 50, 40, 30, 20, and even 10 years before us. I realize now that many freedoms I take for granted should be cherished, and more freedoms should be fought for."
5,I was very impressed with the dictionary and purchased a second one for relative.,This most recent purchase was for a young male relative who is very interested in learning the spanish language. I also have the same dictionary.
4,Excellent dictionary -- please note that it is Canadian,"This is a superbly organized visual dictionary that is user-friendly and quite comprehensive. PLEASE NOTE -- and nowhere in the descriptions of the book is this mentioned -- that this is a Canadian publication, and this causes differences in vocabulary for terms used in France and other Francophone nations. Whether the omission of ""feutre"" as the word for a marker or the descriptions of lettuce or many other vocabulary cases, a significant number of these terms, and the items chosen (particularly for food), are NOT those that would be used or found correct in France. This is perfectly fine, of course, but it should be made clear."
5,Excellent book!,We love this book! We got it when my oldest was 4. She spent hours looking at the pictures then and still spends hours now. It has helped her develop her love of animals into a fascination with animal habitats.
1,DuggyWuggy,"I am a big fan of dance music, but I found this CD very unexciting. In fact, I would use the word ""BORED"" to describe my reaction to this product."
3,Solid Electro,"This cd has a couple of good tracks such as ""hidden thoughts ""and some slow ones as well. Otherwise generic overall. Save Your money."
5,Great Movie and it's Criterion so you can't go wrong!,"A CLASSIC movie and CRITERION always puts out a nice package- the extra bonus footage is nice-highly recommended ! If you've never seen this movie, it is sure to please- check out IMDB.com for movie synopsis...Jeanne Moreau is just gorgeous in it- AND, the soundtrack from Miles Davis is SPECTACULAR!"
3,Elevator to the Gallows,"Having read the various reviews for this film, I must confess I was disappointed with it. Yes, it does show Moreau's ability, but I felt that the script fell apart midway. I was also expecting more of Miles Davis than the film presented. They could have cut the walk in the park, etc. Frankly I must say I feel that the film ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" with Lana Turner and John Garfield, (don't remember the director) was overall a better movie."
2,Ordinary with Loop Holes,"Expected to see a top-notch film.But,instead,I saw a low-budget not-too-well-done B-movie. The situations are implausible, thus rendering the movie hardly believable.Nothing special about the acting in spite of Moreau.It is an overkill to have this movie honored as a Criterion edition."
5,Classic,"This is a classic Hip-Hop album. It made a name for House Of Pain. Everlast, Dannyboy and Lethal are at heir best on this classic. Muggs lays down the beats and Cypress Hill and Funkdoobiest spit lyrics on 2 songs. Everlast & Dannyboy flow throughout the album. Pete Rock Remix of Jump Around is solid as well. ""The time has come, for everyone to clean out their own backyard, before they go knockin on their neighbor's door."""
4,House of Pain-,this is a word this CD: DOPE! it has hard-hittin beats with Everlast rugged voice and tigth producing by Soul assasins.Oh yeah these guys are both white and irish and can still rap tight.

5,1 OF THE BEST EVA !,THIS ALBUM IS SIMPLEY 1 OF THE GREATEST HIP-HOP ALBUMS OF ALL TIME. NO TRUE RAP ALBUM COLLECTION IS COMPLETED WITHOUT THE H.O.P. TRYLOGY ESPECIALLY THIS ALBUM. so stop reading this HALF A$$ review & go buy this album!
5,Not a rap/hip hop fan,"And swore I never would be. Most of its offensive and all about about biatches and dollars. And some of that's here in House of pain, but simply put, this cd rocks. Great riffs, lyrics and rythmm. House of pain has made me break my oath, 'cause the're good. If you like Kid Rock, you'll hear a lot of where his style comes from here; I'll be spinnin' this cd for years to come. No doubt."
5,Fine Malt Lyrics indeed.,"This album is over 10 years old now and I enjoy it as much as ever. Every listen makes me want to shave my head, put on my Celtics jersey, and drink a brew. The subject matter on here is so much fun. Fighting, smoking, drinking, and sex. Who but Everlast can make reference to everything from ""Jedi's"" to ""Boss Hog""? If all you know is ""Jump Around"", know that every track is equally as phat. I would also suggest their 2nd album, and Everlast's ""Whitey Ford sings the blues"". The white boy returns and gets all my love."
2,One good song,"I got this cd for one main song. There are a couple others songs on the cd that are OK, but nothing great."
3,"OK for new age/techno, not for authentic chants","There IS chanting in this CD set, but most of it is more new age chant-inspired music. For the real thing, you need ""Spiritual Songs, Chants & Flute Music of the Native American Indian"" on the Dejavu Retro Gold Collection."
2,Disproportionate earrings,"I was disappointed with this purchase. The turquoise bits turned out much smaller than expected, and the earrings turned out longer.One of the turquoise pieces was larger than the other, resulting in uneven size between the right and the left.Didn't turn out as well as pictured."
5,Great Bargin HDMI cables!,"I saw this product when I was getting my HD DVD player and thought that this would be the ideal way to connect this to my 32 inch vizio. I was skeptical at first, due to the cheap price and some bad reviews. When it arrived, I was impressed with it. The cable worked like a charm and was very cheap! the only problem was my reciever didn't have HDMI pass through and ended up using it on a upconverting DVD player instead."
5,Best connection,I used this cable with my HDTV and Philips DVP5982 1080p Upscaling DVD Player. It's must better than other connections because I just had to plug it into the back of the DVD player and into my TV monitor. My husband swears the quality of the picture is better than when we used the video component cables. I can't really tell too much.
5,Excellent,Unbelievably low price for a utility item that otherwise would cost 5-6 times much. And it works just as well as the more costly HDMI cables I have.
3,Quality display iffy,I couldn't get the screen and the laptop to match up to display the screen. When I did the quality was not good.
5,HDMI Cables no need for pricey ones!,"I recently bought a Philips 42"" LCD and LOVE IT, but didn't have the HDMI cables so I was using the regular plug from the cable. After reading over 100 positive reviews about Cables To Go I decided to go for it, especially with such a cheap price.As soon as I plugged in the cables, my HD viewing experience was enhanced! ESPN HD is amazing and it feels like I'm right there in the Sports Center Studio. I can't wait for football season.I highly recommend these cables for the viewer who is not crazy about finding the perfect HD picture, but still cares about quality and overall picture. They work great in my opinion. So if you're looking for good cables, at a cheap price to provide quality HD viewing these are just perfect."
5,great product,The cable works as well as another much more expensive brand I have purchased. great product and great price.
5,Good inexpensive cables which work just fine for 1080P HDMI,"As the title states, I am quite happy with my choice of these cables. My wife (who is not an engineer) was all conned by the BestBuy guys into buying the Monster cables for at least 8 times the price I paid here. I convinced her that even if we go wrong we wont loose much money - we can always buy Monster cables later.But we didnt have to. The cables are working just fine on all 3 TVs - I bought 3 cables.=HD Lover"
2,Not a good quality hdmi cable,This cable is only good for 480p and lower equipment. Totally unacceptable for 1080p even at 6 ft lengths. Returned to Amazon. Haven't gotten credit yet.
1,Waste of money,I used this on my Directv HD box to high end panasonic plasma and compared HDTV programing between this cable and component cables that came free with the HD Box. I actually like the free compoent cables better.
3,Pretty Generic,I guess they are ok. Don't even remember why I bought or what I used them for. Got them because of the price.
1,DO NOT BUY,This cord did not work. The audio was a loud screeching sound. Had to buy the pricier version from a local store.
1,How much are you really saving?,"Product worked great for a 1 year duration, did everything a cable is supposed to do.Low grade plating however will corrode after some time in a variable humidity environment - anywhere below 10k feet.The end result of the cable corrosion?Luckily the only thing that occured was the HDMI port on the television was burnt.It would have been a costly error if there were only one HDMI port on the unit but luckily the Vizio upper end versions have two.I tried to post a picture of the corroded cable but the file was too large.The Belkin cable which had been used for 18 months total from my first HDMI port was totally clean as where all of the devices attached.Subsequently I purchased a belkin spliter and two more HDMI cables.p.s. All devices are on an APC surge protector."
2,Weak Link?,Discovered that this cable was probably not designed for use with higher end setups. The TV and Blu-ray player I bought should be paired with a higher (and yes considerably more expensive) cable. Sports and action flicks need a faster speed cable.
1,CHEAP CABLE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"Head of cable pulled right out of the housing the first time I turned my TV sideways. Unbelievable!! DO NOT BUY THIS CHEAPLY MADE PRODUCT. You will just be replacing it, as I am in the first week. UNBELIEVABLE!! KRAP"
1,"U get what you pay for, crap","these cables are awful, do not buy them. I have a sony upscaling dvd play and a philip 37 in lcd tv. When i use the dvd player in the hdmi input, there is a lime green line that will not go away on the far right side of the tv. not only that, today there was a pink tint to the picture. i tried different dvds and setting on the tv but nothing changed it. I know it was the hdmi cable becuase i plugged it in regular and the picture worked fine."
4,Great cable for the price,"For some reason, the 1m version of this cable is $8 more than the 2m version! The cable delivers high quality audio and video signals which are virtually indistinguishable from cables costing more than 3 times as much. I know, as I tried a Monster cable prior to trading down (I needed 4 cables: one for the AVR, one for the DVR, one for the upconverting DVD player, and one for the PS3).Highly recommended unless money's no object."
2,Poor construction.,"I wanted a shorter cable than the $10 RCA 3m cable thrown in with my TV purchase. The ""Cables To Go"" 40315 2 meter cable is thin and much lighter than the RCA cable. Initially I liked the 40315 cable as I have an articulating mount, and it moved more freely while positioning the TV than the RCA cable which tended to get hung up because it was thicker and heavier. Problem now with 40315 cable is that if I move the TV while the TV is on, the HDMI connection between the cable box and the TV gets cut off. Somewhere within the 40315 cable it shorts or disconnects.Leads me to think that this is a cheaply constructed cable. Being skinny like it is may mean it comes from cheap material, and if this company skimps on materials it may also skimp on insuring quality construction."
4,Quality is not expensive,"Excellent quality for the price. You don't need to buy Monster cables, to get excellent quality to support HD 1080P digital signals"
5,I can't believe I got this so cheap!,These cords run upwards of $50 in the store. I can't believe I got such a deal. This is great and we haven't had any problems. I definitely noticed a positive difference when we plugged it into our new TV.
4,It's a cable,It works. It cost less than I could find it in a store around here. It arrived promptly.
5,Good buy,For the price excellent quality picture. Being used on RCA upconverting DVD player to Phillips 1080p HDTV.
3,you get what you pay for,"I have two types of hdmi cables: the $70 monster cables and these. I clearly notice the difference between each (and you can guess which one has the better picture). However, both cables work like hdmi cables should -- they output high. For this price, it's a good deal; however, if you are very particular about picture quality and will look for any flaws you might want to go with a more expensive cables."
1,Could not connect to HDMI socket on TV,"I purchased 2 of these cables to connect my cable box and PS3 to a new LCD TV. I could only connect 1 of these to the HDMI socket on my TV. When I tried to connect the other, it simply would not go into the socket. I tried in all 4 HDMI sockets, both ends and no go. The cable did connect with no issues to the cable box HDMI socket, not sure why it would not connect to the TV HDMI socket. I then went to Best Buy and picked up one of their store brand cables and it went into the socket with no issues."
1,I wouldn't recommend it.,This is the first thing I have bought from amazon that I have had to return. I have bought HDMI cables from Amazon before I am still using them and am quite satisfied. They no longer carried the other cables so I purchased these. They are very poor quality and didn't work well when I hooked them up. I wouldn't recommend them.
2,"Ordered 4 of these, 1 failed after 7 months","I ordered 4 of these HMDI cables for my new entertainment center and have been using them for about 7 months now. Recently, when playing DVDs, the picture would go black for a few seconds and sometimes the DVD player would display an error saying the device it's connected to isn't HDMI compatible. (Obviously, I hadn't changed anything.) Some technical discussion forums pointed to the HDMI cable as potential root cause.So I bought a more expensive cable (Belkin) and replaced the one between DVD player and receiver. The error went away. Now I'm of course worried that the remaining 3 cables may also fail at some point. In future I may spend more on cables to avoid issues like this."
3,Good all-around cable,"It does the job, though I do get a staticy signal at times that annoys me when I'm on the PS3. I can't tell for sure if it's the cable, the TV, or the PS3, but overall it's fine. I almost bought the monster but couldn't justify it in my heart."
5,hdmi,You can't beat a cord that retails for over $100 bucks at best buy and costs under $20 on amazon. Does everything I need it to do. Great item!
5,It just works,"I bought this HDMI cable with the Sony upcovert DVD player and it worked flawlessly so I have nothing bad to say. My only wish is to have an angled plug at one end (that goes into the DVD player) so I can have the DVD player closer to the wall on the small shelf under my plasma TV. Overall, I'd recommend this HDMI cable for its low price and excellent performance."
1,Unnecessary Purchase,I purchased the cable as suggested by Amazon as other items to buy along with the purchase of my HDTV. Upon installation I found that the cable was unnecessary for the average TV installation. I did return the cable for a partial refund. This was a bad purchase for a dollar loss.
1,Not been able to use it!,"I would probably be able to give this product a real review, if I had received the Receiver I ordered to go with it. It's been about a month since I placed the order."
5,not too good to be true,"When I first saw the price of this cable vs. what I was seeing in the store, I was convinced that there was something missing from this product. I have used this cable two connect both an XBOX 360 and a DVR to two different televisions. It provides a great quality image at 1080p and 720p. I did not find the cable to be loose at the connections or flimsy in any way. This cable flat out does the job at a fraction of what you would pay in the store."
3,Loose cable,The cable was very loose when connected to the back of both the LCD TV and the DVD player. I tried the cable in a few other devices my friends had and although the cable was functional it was loose.
4,Decent HDMI cable,Just as good as those $50 cables...didn't notice any difference in quality compared to monsters cables that go for three times as much.
5,Awesome cables for price,"DONT LOOK ANYWHERE ELSE, just get your HDMI cables right here with these.Unless you NEED more than 15 feet of HDMI cable you don't need to buy cables that have SUPER SHIELDING and 2cm of thick plastic.Anything under 10 to 15 feet for HDMI cables you can buy anything.These are perfect! Dont get tricked into buy MONSTER HDMI cables or any other brand. 3 meters of HDMI cable should not cost you more than 20 dollars.You are getting ripped off if you do."
5,Great For The Price!,"I just got my Hdmi cables today and so far they are great for the price, i had $50 dollar Hdmi cables from RadioShack that i returned, and these cables look and sound the same if not better,i would get another pair of these cables"
1,Intermittantly failed and then finally did completely.,"I know I am probably the only person with a bad experience with this cable, but the fact that it intermitently failed to conduct the signal from my cable box to my 46"" Sony XBR Bravia LCD for about 2 months made it hard to diagnose. I was sure that the cable company was to blame until it finally crapped out altogether. Then, just by switching cables from my DVD (Phoenix) my signal was fixed and worked perfectly for the last month. So I had a $3K TV that i was not happy with for 2 months because of a problem with a $20 cable. My advice is to buy the best cable and save money elsewhere."
2,"does not support 120hz, per manufcturer","Using a digital HDMI cable is more than just 1's and 0's. If you go to the manufacturer's (acoustic impact) website, you will find this cable does not support 10-bit color, nor does it support 120hz on the new LCD's. Accustic Impact's only HDMI line that supports these features is their ""SONICWAVE(tm)"" line. If you are buying an HDTV that has 120hz or 10-bit color, it behooves you to buy a cable that will allow you to utilize those features.If you are using a Blu-Ray player or HD-DVD, dont bother with this cable, you are not going to get the full benefits of these players.You can view this info with these links from their website:http://www.impactacoustics.com/product.asp?cat%5fid=3004&sku;=40280http://www.impactacoustics.com/pdf_files/Understanding%20HDMI%201.3.pdf?"
1,Not worth the money,"I couldn't get a good signal running one of these cables directly from my DVR to my TV, let alone using a pair of them to run the signal through my receiver. Don't recommend them. I ended up buying some 24awg cables by Monoprice, which were almost twice as much money, but still affordable and most importantly worked great."
4,Good cable for the price,"I ordered two of these cables for use with my current set-up (Panasonic 50"" 1080p plasma, Playstation 3). The cables seemed to work fine, but I was concerned that they may not be rated at 120hz and version 1.3b. To make sure I was getting all that my system had to offer, I purchased the Mediabridge HDMI cables (also from Amazon.com) that were clearly rated at the above standards. To be fair, I realy didn't notice much of a difference in image quality. However, for a few dollars more, the mediabridge cables appear to be more sturdy and of a higher build quality. That being said, these cables are still a good value for the price and I am using them now for another TV (720p) with good results."
4,"Nothing fancy, but they do the job","I've ordered 3 of these cables so far, and have been using them to connect my PS3, DVD, and Cable box to my HDTV for about a year with no issues at all. The cables are not weighty but nor are they flimsy. I've had Monster cables which have thicker wires and larger, weightier connectors, but honestly these perform just as well as Monster in my experience. If you need HDMI cables, I would highly recommend these."
3,Cables are cables,"I bought these with my Oppo DVD player because the way Amazon presented it, it appeared that HDMI cables were not included with DVD player. Oh well.Just like Monster cables, there is no real difference between these and any cheaper cables. These are fine."
3,hdmi cable- make sure your new dvd doesn't have one before buying this,"it works like other hdmi cables, it's blue, 2M in length, maybe a little overpriced considering they're all the same."
5,hdmi cables,"Save you money and buy these cables. I bought a new Sony 46 inch LCD, and these HDMI cables work great."
3,Green screen problem with Roku,"I purchased the Cables to Go cable with my PS3 to connect it directly to a Vizio VX32L LCD TV. It worked almost flawlessly, a few times I noticed the screen would stay blue when switching screen resolutions between 1080i and 720p for some games. When I purchased my Roku I bought thePremium HDMI v1.3 Cable (2M/6ft.)for some variety. I originally used the HDMI v1.3 cable with the PS3 and moved the Cables to Go cable to the Roku. I was constantly plagued with a green screen on the TV when the Roku input was selected. Forums suggest the Roku has an issue with some cables and the green screen may be an HDCP issue that occurs after the device is idle for a while. Exasperated, I switched cables and the Roku is now connected to the Vizio with thePremium HDMI v1.3 Cable (2M/6ft.). I haven't experienced any more green screen problems. Your millage may vary, but thePremium HDMI v1.3 Cablemay be the new winner in low cost HDMI cable."
1,Horrible - didn't work,"I purchased this cable with a Blu-ray player and 46"" LCD. It worked badly, half way through a movie, the signal would give out, come back for a little while and then give out again (this happened a couple of times). For a while I thought it was a player or LCD problem (or something I had mis-set), but after trying everything I exchanged this HDMI cable out and the problem never came back. Not worth the money (even at this cheap price)."
5,Don't Spend Money On a Name! Buy this cable instead!,"Why spend an additional $30-$40 more for Monster cables when these are exactly what you are looking for? I recently purchased this cable along with a new upconverting Sony DVD player and I couldn't be happier. This cable works like a dream and I paid 1/2 the price of what Monster is asking. Don't be fooled! If you want to watch movies in 1080i on your LCD tv, this is the cable you are looking for!"
5,everything you'd want w/o the Monster price,This is my 2nd HDMI cable and I have nothing but good things to say. I have one for my HD cable box to my LCD TV and another from my upconverting DVD to my TV. Both make the picture look great! No need to buy a major brand. The money is not worth it. This works great!
5,"Cheap, long, does the job",The above says it all. There is no reason to buy a more expensive cable. This is an excellent value.
3,1 out of 2,"I bought two of these HDMI cables to complete setting up a PS3, XBox360 and HD Satellite receiver to a new sony receiver. All was working fine for a few weeks. Then the PS3 was not functioning. Initially thought it was the PS3, but after swapping cables with the XBox discovered that it was the cable itself. I am just hoping that the other cable doesn't just stop functioning. though i am not quite sure how it just stopped working to begin with. Nevertheless, Amazon is sending a replacement."
5,High quality and value HDMI cable!,This HDMI cable worked well with HD digital as well as Blu-ray DVD's. The fit into the receptacle is snug and the cable is flexible.
5,"Why pay more, when you can pay less ?","This cable is excellent, with a superb picture quality. So, why pay more, when you can pay less."
5,Perfect!!,"These cables work great!! Running from my HD Cable box to my 50"" Samsung DLP. The picture is incredible on the true HD channels. Don't waste your money on more expensive cables!!!"
5,HDMI cable,"Definitely need the HDMI cables for optimum viewing pleasure. The coax cables just don't cut it. Save the money and get the HDMI cables here, not in the store."
1,Bad cable.,"Mine didn't work. I see a lot reviews saying theirs did (which is why I bought this), but mine had a bad connector on one end which made the signal cut in and out. Just mentioning it, because I'll be spending a few extra bucks for a brand name next time, and maybe you'll want to also, just to avoid the hassle of a cable that might show up broken like mine did.-m"
5,What a bargain,"For the price this is just awesome, yes is a little flimsy and not the thicker cable, but works for what was made to. For the price this is a great bargain specially if you go to a stpre and the lowest price is about $25..."
5,HDMI Cables,"Using these cables between my Hi-Def cable box and HDTV. They work great, don't waste your money on those over priced monsters."
1,no audio,Ordered two of the cables. Tried to use one and had no audio over it. Did not open second one. Sent both back for a refund.
3,Blue cord,It does it job. The picture on our flat screen is clearer and the sound is so much better.
2,"Product Okay, Delivery Too Long",I ordered this product without really knowing HDMI cables. It tooks me 2 weeks to get them while the LCD arrived in 4 days. So I went to Sam's Club and bought 2 HDMI cables which were a little more expensive. These HDMI cables seems like they are much better cables and I had them when I needed them.
4,Advertised color,"I ordered Cables To Go..""Blue"",as advertised on your site.In fact every place you can find these cables on your site they are blue.Then why in the world do you ship them out,and they are black?...even tho the product number is the correct one.And yes,I could ship them back,but the time and aggravation this takes makes it not even close to being worthwhile.Cables To Go - 40315 - 2M (6.6ft) Velocity HDMI Digital Video Cable (Blue)"
4,CABLES TO GO - HDMI 2M Digital High Performance I/F!,Very nice Product. Pricey. Only get what paid for! There with the best. Looking for more. Would repeat purchase this one or related. Good bet purchase HDMI Cable!
4,HDMI Cable,Used this cable to replane a component DVD hook-up that had a hum when not playing. The hum diappeared.
1,MODE NOT SUPPORTED 1080p,"These cables did not work between my DVR and my brand new Samsung 1080p HDTV. My HDTV reported ""Mode not supported"" which, according to the tv manual, suggests this hdmi cable is NOT CAPABLE of high bandwidth video/audio transmission. A real waste of money. I'll never buy another connector cable from Amazon or one made by Cables To Go."
3,Work Fine...Strange Delivery,"Simple HDMI cables...great price...work well...only complaint was strange and and delayed delivery by ""galaxy technology""...ordered three on December 14th...arrived in three separate deliveries: Dec.24th...Jan.5th and Jan.6th... and the 2nd two after only 3 e-mails to vendor and one to Amazon...also, no tracking information supplied."
4,More for less!,I have been buying HDMI cables (9) from Amazon for more than two years. They have never failed to function properly. I bought my first HDMI cable from BestBuy. It cost me a hundred dollars. I bought the same length cable at Amazon for less than $10. Both were made of high quality. Which one are you going to choose?
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought two of these. One works great, the other failed out of the box. After trying to figure out why my audio/video receiver wasn't sending a picture to my LCD TV, I checked the cable with an ohm meter - there's a break in the cable somewhere.You'll read some reviews that'll say ""it's just pushing 1's and 0's"", that's true. You have to ask yourself why the electrical cable to your clothes dryer is so much different than the one to your clock radio - ""it's just pushing electricity"" :-)Buy these if you want, just remember, there's a risk associated with the savings."
4,worth it,"well constructed and well worth the low price, especially since the cables are rarely moved once put into place."
5,Don't spring for the $99 cables!,Researched cables online and quickly found the advice to order cables online instead of buying at the electronics store. What a savings and these are just great.
2,Comparison,"I have two cables now, this one and another wider gauge cable with those hard plastic cylinders at the ends (I'll spare everyone the tech talk). This thin, flimsy Cables-to-Go product gives me a thin, flimsy picture. The other, more substantial cable give me a far richer, deeper picture. I have two HDTV's and two HDMI players; I tried both cables on both sets of equipment and the result was the same."
1,Faulty Cable,Picture quality is very poor. Colors washed out. I replaced the cable with an older cable I had and the picture was perfect. I didn't bother to return it because of the shipping cost. I put it in the garbage.Avoid this brand.H. Selim
5,Great Product,This is the second HDMI cable bought from Cables to Go and i was really impressed so i bought another
4,Good HDMI at GREAT price,"This is a good HDMI cable at a great price. Granted the more expensive HDMI typically have thicker jackets, these HDMI's work well for the purpose they are meant to serve."
5,"Works just as well, for cheaper","For the non-expert like myself, this cable delivers high quality. I don't notice any higher quality for the more expensive components. Get it."
5,A Bargain!,Every bit as good as my $60 (and half the length) Monster Cable! Do not hesitate to buy this.
5,Happy I didn't buy the expensive ones,a friend tipped me off to buy these cables instead of the expensive $60 ones at the store. they were easy and work great with my sony bravia. i have no complaints and have been using them for one month. i suggest investing in these before buying the other ones.
5,No need to pay more,These cables were recommended by CNET. Their review stated that there is no need to pay the outrageous price that comes with cables like the ones branded by Monster. I've placed two orders for these and both times I've been completely satisfied with the construction and image quality.
5,Love it,I recently bought a new Sony Bravia and home theater and the cables included were only like 3 feet - not long enough to run through the wall like I wanted. I bought this after returning $120 Monster cables - what a rip for those. This cable worked great and did the job.
5,HDMI Cables,Cables work great. Great price. Better than paying $40-$50 at Best Buy or Circuit City. Very happy with the purchase.
4,Does the job,"These are fair for what they cost. No frills type deal with hooking them up,could be thicker but good overall.10/29/2012: Cant beat the cost."
4,Good HDMI Cables,"Don't waste your money on the ""extra high"" HDMI cable prices at Best Buy, etc! These cables work just fine."
5,HDMI Cables,I bought this set of HDMI Cables to hook up a DVD Player Recorder. I received the order timely. I have them installed between my LCD 42 inch TV and the Player Recorder and they work perfectly. I purchased a more expensive set of the HDMI Cables for my TV hookup to my cable box and can see no difference in reception on either product. I will use again and do recommend this company.
5,Works as described,I've purchased several HDMI cables from Cables To Go. They snap in with a positive feedback and silently carry out their assigned mission. Other HDMI cables I tried actually did let me down due to sloppy fit - but not these.Tom
4,The BEST DEAL in HDMI cables,There's not a whole lot of words needed here. I bought this cable a couple of months ago primarily because it was 1/10th the price of cables available locally and I was already ordering a Blu-Ray DVD player. It works perfectly... and I still can't believe the price! This is the best deal in HDMI cables.
3,Product you see is not what you get.,"I just received the 2 Cables To Go HDMI cables I ordered from Amazon. They are black, not blue as the pic shows and that is in the title of this product. The package says ""Impact Acoustics"" as the 1 pic has, but nowhere does it say ""Cables To Go"". Also, the design on the back of the HDMI heads is different than shown in the pic. So, basically you don't get what 1 of the pics show for this product. Gonna try them out and hope they are as good as advertised. Just letting people know that they're not getting exactly what is depicted here."
1,Worked for 2 weeks,I used this cable to connect my DVR to my HDTV. This cable worked fine for 2 weeks after which I lost audio.
1,Failed in two weeks,"Stay away from this product. I saw many positive feedbacks on this and ordered one for my new sony 40"" LCD TV. It worked fine for just two weeks and then stopped working"
5,No different from the expensive one's.,"I have a set of Monster cables too. I regret paying so much for them after I made this purchase. They are no different quality wise. I have the cables hooked up to my Plasma and HD-DVD player. If I needed an extra one, I wouldn't hesitate making the same purchase again."
3,it's ok,"i see somewhat of a difference from my component cables. i'm glad i didn't pay an arm and a leg for it. they cable is a little loose though, so i'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but like i said the picture quality is fine, so i'm not to worried about it. if i need to buy another one i won't mind since i didn't spend that much."
4,"Good cables, Great Price","I almost got sucked in to the Electronics store trap. Buy an upconverting DVD at a great price and... ""oh, you need this $45 cable to make it work."" I'm glad I waited on the cable. $10 plus shipping through Amazon and it works great! Thanks!"
4,.,"These are my first HDMI cables, but they do exactly what they are supposed to do at a great price. I've since picked up a HDMI switch from Cables to Go that came with three more of these cables. Good Product & great company"
3,Pay a little more if you have a upper end tv,"This cable works well for upconvert dvd players etc. I hooked it up to my new Samsung 61"" led dlp set from my Directv HD DVR and things just did not look right. Went and bought a 40 dollar cable and it made a big difference."
1,Waste of time and money,"I have to cycle my DVR every day when using this cable. Otherwise the signal will NOT reach the TV. With better cable that is never a problem.Here, with a Samsung TV and Verizon Fios box, this cable DOES NOT work.Nelson"
1,Did not work--do not waste your money--no customer service.,"Got this and did not use for 2 months. When my system came I connected it to my dvd and the cable did not work unless you held it to the connection on the dvd. Went out and bought another brand at Best Buy. Called company since more than 30 days had passed. Company would not refund money--only replace, but why would I need 2 cables. Do yourself a favor and do not buy from this company,"
2,Dont waste your 10 bucks,"The only reason I didnt give these cables 1 star, is because they only cost 10 bucks. Probably better than an analog connection, but HD picture still grainy and not up to par. The way I see it, if you are going to spend the big money on a nice HDTV, why not spring for Monster cables too.I am buying Monsters as I write."
1,Failed signal with these cables...,"The cable intermitently failed signal from my Panasonic Blu Ray Player to my 52"" Samsung HDTV. I too thought that cables wouldn't make a difference. I was wrong. I changed out the cable with a MONSTER brand HDMI and to my suprise, everything worked fine. It probably works fine for some folks, but in my case, I'll go with a more dependable cable."
3,Feels Like Progressive House,"This CD felt to my like a progressive house mix. I tried to get into it but it just didn't catch on with my like Music Through Me. My subs were pumping and he's got that signature pumped up bass, but besides that I don't feel the CD really took off until the 4th or 5th song. He's a great mixer, but I don't feel that it is anything above what he's done in the past. The DVD is kind of odd, too. I wish more DJs would actually show them mixing a live set or something, and not just the same screen, or weird clips from the 60s. I didn't get it."
4,Pretty Good,"It isn't anything special, and if it were just the music alone, I would probably give it a 3, but because it comes with the DVD too, it gets a 4. Micro can do so much better though, which he has proved in the past time and time again.My Favorite tracks on this album would have to be The Silver Lining, Time's Running Out, Penetrate (DJ Micro original), and Bound. Other than the rest of the songs are mediocre at best, except for In and Out which is probably the worst piece of crap I've ever heard in my life.If you are a big Micro fan like I am, than I highly reccomend getting this album because the DVD add on is great. Even if you don't know Micro at least still give it a try, because there are some really good songs on here, they just get caught in between a larger amount of mediocre ones."
3,Dj Micro,"Im not here to write a long review about this album. I received a promo copy and decided to listen to it. I have actually liked Dj Micro in the past, so I decided to give it a chance. The mixing on the CD was very boring, for the first 5 or 6 tunes the mixing was only done in about 20 seconds. That isn't mixing, its boring. I decided to take the cd out before finishing it because I figured he would do the exact same thing all the way threw. There are some DATED tracks like protonic on the cd as well. Either way, the TL was ""OK"" but the mixing was less than par."
4,"""...one of the overlooked gems of 1998!""","I'm sorry I didn't see JOHN WATER'S PECKER on the big screen, as it certainly would have made my 10 best list for 1998. It's funny, sweet and totally off beat. Waters scores again. His commentary on the disc is the best I've heard since the laserdisc of EL MARIACHI."
5,awesome movie,"This is such a great movie! I loved it. It's full of quirky comedy and many familiar faces (Christina Ricci, Edward Furlong, and Brendon Sexton the third to name a few). I definitly suggest you take a few minutes to sit down and take a dip into Pecker's world and get to know ""Memama"",""Little Chrissy"", his best friend -the shoplifter extrodinare, his girlfriend who has an obsession with her laundermat and the rest of the kookie characters in Pecker's life. ""Pecker"" is definitely one of my all time fav's!!!!"
3,Kinda good,"Had a hard time deciding if I liked this film, I give it three stars simply because it's quirky and a bit charming. I did laugh out loud at a few scenes. Pecker becomes famous from taking everyday photographs of the people he runs across. He is discovered and is given a show in New York. The multiple subjects he took pictures of slowly become aware that they cannot get back into the groove of regular life. This film is only an hour and thirty minutes and that is simply a bit too long. It is a cute film. Worthwhile? I'm not sure."
4,John Waters collection,"This box set of six of John Waters films are a fine addition the anyones collection of off beat wacky and a bit of ""gross out"" films. For the open minded and connoisseurs of the exotic and unusual!!"
5,"Outrageous, but full of good will","This is the movie that redeemed John Waters for me. It's laugh-out-loud funny, totally outrageous, but full of good will and human kindness. It skewers the New York art establishmant most delightfully and casts an affectionate eye on Baltimore and its denizens. An absolute delight!"
2,"A big disappointment, hon!","As a native Marylander and early John Waters fan, I had only moderate hopes for ""Pecker,"" but even they were too high. It seems that at this point in his career, Waters needs to move on. His bad writing now seems contrived to imitate his early low-rent successes. You really can't go home again, but I believe with bigger budgets and presumably improved skills, Waters could still do wonderful, satiracle movies about Baltimore--and places like it. But ""Pecker"" seems to be the work of a lazy artist too willing to rest on his laurels. Too bad. There are some funny moments, but overall, the movie drags and sustains no momentum. And Ricci, Place and others are wasted on badly scripted and badly directed material."
5,Very Entertaining,"This movies is funny, fast moving and you can't guess what is going to happen next. I really enjoyed it and thing that you will too. A movie made outside the box."
5,A must-see for photographers,"There's a deeper understanding for this movie from photographers, especially pro-level amateurs who keep a day job to support themselves. Almost anyone familiar with the so-called ""art scene"" will also find many poignant moments. There's a lot of visual and verbal innuendos, so it's great viewing the second and third time around. John Waters fans will love it."
4,Worked for me,"If you like movies whose humor would offend the puritanical (e.g. Clerks or Austin Powers) then consider this one. It definately does not suit all tastes but worked fine for me. Some of the acting was a bit amateurish, but that added a bit of charm. Weird."
5,"Cute, not just ""campy""","Whatever preconceptions I brought to this John Waters film simply disappeared in a ""flash"" (forgive the pun) because this movie is just FILLED with lots of fun for everyone. It's a lot gentler than HAIRSPRAY, for example, and the overall look of the movie was more like naivete, with a generous ""wink"" to the audience. I especially liked the snappy, peppy theme song and found myself replaying the credits (both beginning and end) just to hear it again. And Edward Furlong was the perfect Pecker. What a refreshing treat of a film!!!"
5,lovin' eddie furlong,"If you love eddie furlong buy it, because it's a whole lot of eddie.It's his only comedy besides the new detriot rock city , and his querky charm will leave you with a happy feeling in the end. This movies good heartedness leaves a smile on your face."
2,Pretty cheesy!,"I'm from Baltimore, but I've never been a big John Water's fan. I've never really been able to appreciate his brand of humor. As a result, I was not crazy about this cheesy film. It wasn't terrible, but I didn't find it funny. I did however, really appreciate the director's commentary available on the DVD, where he discussed the film locations and the stories behind the scenes. I watched the movie a second time just to hear it all, and I thought it was more entertaining than the movie. I'm sure John Water fans will like this movie, but most of us don't get it."
2,Yawn,"This is the first John Waters film I've seen, and I hope his others are better. Perhaps my expectations were too high. Nonetheless it is occasionally cute and sometimes funny, but suffers from uninteresting characters and an unimpressive plot/story to begin with. In this film, Waters seems to go out of his way to be clever and idiosyncratic, but winds up being sensational and trite. Like I said, I hope his other films are better..."
3,an ode to Baltimore,"John Waters films are about one thing: his outrageous,over the top characters. I liked the performances of Lili Taylor and Martha Plimpton who brings such personality to her role as the endearing fag hag Tina. And of course you gotta love Memama! only in a Waters film will you see a character listed as ""Guy Humping the Washing Machine"" and probably want to know who played him. Though not his best film, most fans will probably be amused with this one."
2,What's the opposite of a good movie? This one!,"This movie tries too hard to deliver a funny, quirky movie. In the end, it's neither. I found the characters to be boring and one-dimensional.I hated the way Christina Ricci's character was always crying and complaining about everything. I hated that once Pecker became ""famous"", everyone from his original town started to hate him and his photography.In short, I guess you could say I hated this movie just because of all the whining and crying by every single character in the movie."
1,This movie was awful,"From the start, i could see that Pecker was a sucker. Some juvenile deliquent, running around, shooting pictures of trashy neighbors. This movie was not for three seconds amusing. You should definitely NOT rent this movie. It's a waste of both time and money."
1,Can this movie be a little more annoying?,"John Water's campiness and his ability to turn good actors into laughable bad actors worked for his masterpiece, Hairspray, but I found it irritating in this one. Edward Furlong did his best whining, while Christina Ricci played the biggest brat ever. And speaking of brats, how about that little girl who played Furlong's sister? Those three and a bunch of other overacting cast members made me turn off the VCR after only getting into a third of the movie."
4,Submarine Warriors...Both World Wars,A great paper back book which gives short history of WW1 and WW2 sub-commanders. I found it a fast pace book and intresting. There are a few commanders form both wars not included..But that is the authors choice. But still a great book and buy!
2,Not my type,The black one has a very strong smell that's more like a heavy artillery fuel. My wife hates it and it's not my preferred.
3,It's ok...,"It smells ok, a little generic to be honest but my biggest gripe is that it doesnt last long on hubby's clothes, 5 minutes tops, it's like it's been watered down drastically. For a few bucks more you could get a Nautica blue or classic EDT."
2,Tmobile SDA case,"While this T-Mobile SDA case is priced great, it is too small of a fit to hold this cellphone."
2,Cheap clip,Although this case fit my Motorola phone perfectly the clip was so stiff that I had trouble getting it on my belt. Then after less than two weeks the leather covering over the the clip came apart leaving a sharp steel edge. I would not buy another one of these.
2,Troublesome,"I'm having a lot of trouble just getting this product to work properly. Another External HDD enclosure was so simple to use. I just plug it in, turn it on, and everything was just fine.This one though, gave me nothing but trouble (in fact, 3 hours worth). Formatting the new HD inside was difficult. And it constantly blinks blue/red like this is a lightshow.Heck, it doesn't even function properly on my WinXP. It was a lot easier to use with the Vista, but that's not saying much. If I have any more trouble with it, it's going to be an automatic return."
5,Typical French Comedy,"If you have seen ""The Visitors"" and if you liked it, you'll love this one. You'll see the same actors. It's a classic. You'll want to see the 2nd movie ""Les Bronzés font du ski"" this one takes place in a ski resort. Watch it again and again and again... And laugh your head off, just like everybody in France!"
2,Not great,"All in all, I was rather disappointed with this book. I've read about two graphic novels from this series, and I certainly don't plan on reading any more. The plot is old and overused, I can't stand the characters (who are actually just like all of Rumiko Takahashi's other characters with different names), and after that there isn't much to like. Sure, there are some neat monsters, some interesting concepts, but that by itself isn't enough to keep interest."
3,Inuyasha is pretty darn good.,"I ordered the first two of the series.I was pleased with the fact that they were a pretty good length, but I'm still reeling over the cost!American dollars are bad. Very bad. Am so broke *droops*.I love the story very much however, and Inuyasha makes a most adorable villian/good-guy. (confusing isn't it?)I have shared it with a few of my friends. (Trusted ones mind you. Sooooo expensive to replace!)They had a lot of reactions ranging from:*yoink* ""I'll see you after Japanese"" *runs off clutching book muttering 'My preciousssss'*To:""Oh, they aren't very good quality drawings, are they?"" *gets head bashed in by me*And even!:*Opens first page* ""That girl looks really mad. Who is she?""""Oh! He's a guy??? Are you sure???""Yes. That really happened. That particular person also mistook Sesshoumaru for a female but I can forgive her for that.I'd love to buy the rest of the series, but I'm pretty darn sure that I can live without it until the prices go down. One day."
3,Throwaway,"I read this in about 10 minutes. Now I have no idea what happened, very forgetable. I did like it, but it just felt like a huge waste of money. Try to borrow this from a friend. If you want value in your manga, buy the ranma 1/2 perfect collection. At least that will keep you busy for an hour or so and is also much more enjoyable. ^_^"
2,"Unoriginal, Uninspired, Unbleh","This must be the most unoriginal fantasy I've ever encountered. Not only does Rumiko Takahashi take the characters for this book directly from her other books, but she takes the basic plot of a zillion fantasy video games. The plot is that the characters have lost a bunch of scattered pieces of stuff and have to travel around finding them all. Ya-aaay. This will make for a very tedious series."
1,Beware of this book for kids,"Violent, gruesome, nudity. Should be removed from the shelves. My 7 year old son told me he read one of these books that a friend in his second grade class brought in. I purchased a few books in the series and we reviewed one for content. I was horrified to see that it talked about murder, a person saves a bucket of human livers and has to move to another town because he has run out of victims. There were pictures of nude girls on a few of the pages. Although it says it is for Teen on the back cover- Young kids are reading these books. My nephews, who are teens, think these books are for young kids. Most teens are not interested in reading them. Which shows that these books although labeled for teens have a young child audience. I am bringing the books I purchased last night, back to the store this morning."
1,He needs to read his Bible,"This is a problematic book and not worth the money used to print it. This book tries to find the similarities between the Bible and Star Wars which is a very bad idea. This guy does not know the scripture and the command on being separate from the world, and not loving the world. He needs to read 1 John again, as well as John 17, and many other passages. if you want to know how to be a Christian in a secular world, in addition to reading your Bible get the book ""Set Apart"" by Kent Hughes."
2,"A Jedi make you, this book will not.","This book offers only a little insight into the Jedi way.The Star Wars quotes are applied out of context and twisted to fit the authors ideas.In fact you could take out all the Star Wars quotes and the book would be relatively unchanged. Take out the Christianity and there is no content left, yet the front cover has JEDI WISDOM in big font while ""Christian"" hovers above ""JEDI"" in a small font.Essentially, The author is just using the commerical success of Star Wars."
2,Book should have just be named Christian Wisdom,"The name of the book is misleading. The author simply has a Star Wars quote at the beginning of each chapter, followed by a Bible quote. The author goes on to proclaim the Lord of the Force (aka GOD) is the reason for everything. So give in to the will of the Lord of the Force. There is very little in the way of Star Wars here. The author makes some remarks about how Luke and Jesus has similar paths. Then goes on to compare Luke, Han and Leia to Jesus and his disciples. This book just should have been calledChristian Wisdom : By the way I like Star Wars."
1,This book is terrible,"This is a self help book, not a book discussing Christian themes in the Star Wars movies. Do not buy this book. Instead, read your Bible and watch Star Wars. This is just an attempt to cash in one the popularity of Star Wars and peddle Christianity at the same time, neither of which I feel is done well."
1,This book does not stay on target !,The book seems to miss the mark. It just seems like he thought he could slap star wars and christianity on it to make a quick buck. Hey these 2 things have made tons of money in the past right? Ok not a good idea to put the 2 things together. Get dharma of star wars and leave this book on the dark side.
2,Great idea...wrong author,"I was very excited when I came across this book. I am both a Christian AND a Star Wars nut. I began reading this book right away, and it started slow. I kept reading, hoping it would really dive into some good contrast. It never came. I'm sure this guy meant well, but he had a very shallow knowledge of the Star Wars films, and on the Christian side, everything felt like it was from a 5th grade Sunday school class. I want so badly for this book to be great, but it is not. I wish I would have written it."
4,brilliant and enjoyable.,"This book is not recommended for readers seeking a straightforward account of the battles of the eastern front. While stone does depict these events the narrative is typically concerned with several different minutae of both the russian army and its relation to society at large. Stone looks at various aspects of the campaign and makes persuasive arguments to debunk various notions and myths which surround general accounts. The analysis is brilliant and gives the reader indepth evocative information about the chosen facets he wishes to illumnate. And that is the whole point. If one is well read in this area it serves as a cornerstone in their already voluminous library on the era. For a non academic like myself however it left me wanting more, primarily because it was so good."
4,Good book but my expectations were high!,I liked this book but it wasn't quite what I expected. I thought it focused to much on Russian economics and politics. While these are important topics and deserve to be discussed I was hoping for more on military operations. I also thought more maps would have been helpful. I would rate this 3 1/2 stars. It is a good book though ( on a topic that needs more books!) and I do recommend it! I think my expectations were too high based on the other reviews I have read. I am glad to have this in my WW1 book library and Norman Stone is a good writer. I also recommend his Short History of World War One. A lot of good stuff packed into a very short book ( under 200 pgs.)!
3,Excellent book but the kindle version has issues,"I purchased the kindle version of this book and have been sorely disappointed in the presentation of this book. There are numerous typos, grammar errors, missing photos/charts and above all there are whole paragraphs missing. Some of the chapters are so disjointed that I had to go out and purchase the actual book and verify the missing material. If this is the way e-books are done then I will purchase anymore of them."
3,"Okay Book, the Best We Have on the Eastern Front","In writing a pretty in-depth survey of the Great War's eastern front, Stone actually used Russian-language sources, and even documents from Austria! Sarcasm aside, this book is the second place to go after Winston Churchill's The Forgotten War, which is an easy read. You'll learn a great deal from The Eastern Front. Stone's analysis is excellent, but his battle narratives are hurried and not the easiest to follow. It has a few very good maps, but it really needed about twenty. It is a mandatory read for anyone who wants to have a balanced understanding of WWI. We badly need a historian who can read Russian and German to write an operational history of the ""forgotten war"" for the 21st century, and a strategy/policy-level history of the eastern front, and a war and society history of the eastern front . . .."
5,The Russian Front - WW I,"This is the best single volume history of the Russian Front in WW I that there is. Period. It covers the war from 1914 to the collapse of Russia in 1917. In just over 300 pages the author manages to cover every significant military action, all the politic dealings, the economic problems, and the diplomacy which lead to the collapse of Russia. A truly superb book."
3,Oxbridge Common Room History,"Having returned to this book after twenty-five years, I find it ought to lose some of its lustre.It offers an analysis of Russian strategy on the Eastern Front, and of the resources available to wage this war, both material and human. However, as a military history it is hampered by its lack of maps and the inability of the author to describe the battles in any coherent way. I get the impression he was more interested in making snide remarks about personalities than in telling the reader what happened on the battlefield, a very Oxbridge Common Room approach to history, if one may indulge in a bit of it oneself.It earns its third star by the fact of dealing with a subject poorly covered in English.Within its limitations, it's a good book, but these limitations are significant."
2,Too general to be of help,"For me, this book was too general to be of any help.The best I've read so far is FROM REEL TO DEAL."
5,This is the best book available on independent filmmaking.,"As an aspiring filmmaker, I've read more than twenty books on directing and producing independent films. Merritt's book is easily the best, most comprehensive, and most revealing of them all. He tells you everything you need to know to finance, write, produce, direct, and sell a movie. I especially love all of the great ""underground"" tips about how to get free film stock and equipment, how to avoid permits, how to choose the right people, and a non-nonsense guide to distributors. Eveything is here, from catering tips to bank loans to guaranteed foreign video sales. This book will save me thousands of dollars as I make my first feature-length movie. I highly recommend it, as opposed to or in addition to film school. (I went to film school for 4 years for $65,000 and I learned MUCH more practical, real world, current advice with this $20 book.)"
4,Exactly as advertised. Needs updated though.,"A good A-Z book for an independent film maker. A little old though, perhaps an updated version dealing with digital and computers would be better. But definitely a lot of info on the process."
3,Well Written But in Bad Need Of Updating,"The book is easily accessible, informative and well written, but large chunks of it are about a decade behind the times.With HD and Red Cams now on the scene, film lab work is no longer necessary. And any discussion of VHS should be completely removed and replaced with DVD and digital delivery methods."
5,She is Lovely,"I love the way she sings and she reminds me of my home girl Thalia, yeah the one from the latino soaps, Rosalinda, Marimar, Maria del Barrrio. Nawal is an awesome singer, I love her singing, its beautiful even though I don't understand Arabic, her music has rythm and is cheerful to follow her voice."
5,Wow,I'm studying Arabic language as my fourth language now and WOW. I try to immerse myself in the culture when learning the language and Nawal's music not only has beautiful singing but the arrangements have real rhythm! I just got the CD today.. Dal'oona and Maloom are my favorites!
2,Lotsa Typos,"Don't ever buy this book unless you like a lot of typos in the answer key. It has good problems to work on, but the answer key is messed up."
5,Must read for anyone in psychometrics,"Easily accessible...this is a must read for anyone who is serious about studying psychological testing and measurement. This is not a book for beginners, you must have some background in psychometrics, testing and measurement, and statistics."
3,The best of unknown bands that need more practice,I think this dvd is ok for background noise while you're cleaning house or doing whatever. There are only a couple of good songs. I personally don't recommend it.
3,"One of those ""cinematic treasures"" that broke my concentration","Sorry, I bought this and tried to appreciate it. The Spirit of the Beehive is widely regarded as a supreme classic in Spanish film literature. Plus I love Criterion films, but this time I just couldn't catch the significance.It's set in Spain 1940, where a young girl watches the classic movie Frankenstein and becomes entranced by the memory of it. And, uh well, that's pretty much it. The narrative simmers around her outlook and imagination as that character is engrained deeply in her mind.This movie is beautifully shot, but there just isn't much going on. I really like slow paced movies, but I need a little something to hold my interest. This movie takes place after the country's devastating civil war, which I tried to factor in.Overall, this is a unique film that will require some patience. Any comments or insight anyone has will be greatly appreciated."
2,Does not live up to the hype,"How many times have I seen this movie? And now that I own it and have watched it again, my opinion of it has come down considerably. Too long a preface to the main moment, the appearance of the wounded soldier. No connection between Frankenstein, the beehive the mother's lost love and the murder. Everyone walks in slow motion and speaks in whispers without actually moving their lips. It is bad for a movie to leave the viewer saying, so what?"
2,Sterling Silver Trumpet Charm,"Trumpet was pretty nice, although really small. Was going to send item back but didn't want to have to pay restocking fee and shipping charges. Item did not come with little silver attachment for attaching the charm to necklace so is of no use. Wasted my money."
2,Fair and balanced?,"A flashy compendium, but way lopsided. It's so Pistols heavy it about topples off my coffee table. Not that I really have one. It's always great to see the Pistols, but how many pages do the Clash get? About 2. This is the kind of book that promotes Cherry Vanilla and Wayne County as punk. Wayne did give us a memorable show at London's Roxy in 1977 -- but he ain't punk. ""Definitive record""? What a joke. Say something nice? . . hmmmm. Nice photographs. Some of them."
2,If you like the Sex Pistols...,"As other reviews have asserted, this book is heavy on Sex Pistols and associated content from the British Punk scene. However, it completely ignores vast amounts of punk history by ignoring what was going on with Punk music in other parts of the world.Other than a few pages about the Ramones it largely ignores the growth and vitality of the American Punk scene. No Black Flag, no Minor Threat, no Dead Kennedys, no Bad Religion. Further it does not even address other hugely influential British bands like Conflict and Crass.My advice: save your money. If you want to understand punk look for more definitive and interesting records of punk likeThe Philosophy of Punk: More Than NoiseorHardcore California: A History of Punk and New Wave."
2,Hardly Definitive,"There were some good things here. Great pictures and some interesting historical information I wasn't previously aware of. However, the amount of attention given to the Ramones/Sex Pistols is way over the top. I was expecting a comprehensive review of the life and times of Punk in the mid-late 70's. In the end what I got was a biography of 2 bands and Malcom McLaren with fairly brief (comparitavely) impersonal descriptions of other icons of the time. Additionally the collaborators of this book leave the reader the impression that there were only 2 places in the world (New York and London) that were producing anything worth writing about.Worth the buy? Yes I would purchase it again. Disappointing? Again Yes. It could have been so much more."
3,More Pistols Than Punk,"If you are only looking for an excellent book on the sex pistols then this is the book for you. However, if you'd like a book about the punk movement in general, this book would give you little material. While it provides extensive material about punk in the context of the sex pistols, the sex shop/ Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood, it treats other bands in the punk movement like the Ramones, The Clash, and the Damned as afterthoughts. Certainly both the Ramones and the Clash deserved as much attention as the Pistols seeing as they had more longevity and in the case of the Clash, more musical ability. The Book is certainly worth it's price for Sex Pistols fans and those looking for a photographic approach to the movement. However, if you are looking for a book that lends information on bands other than the Pistols, I would look elsewhere."
1,not so hot,"I just finished reading this from my local library. As much as I love Mind over Matter and Robert Klein, this really isn't a funny book. Maybe he didn't intend it to be, but with a title like that I thought it would be a lot more entertaining instead of blandly anecdotal. It's really just one tale after another about women he slept with, in too much detail, or girls he fantasized about- again, too much information. And the book ends abruptly before covering any of his success in the 70's, his political comedy, etc."
2,Sophmoric ... and Soporific,"A coming of age story that emphasizes Klein's teenage and early adult sexual adventures and fantasies, without the depth or insight of Portnoy's Complaint. I was disappointed, as I enjoy Mr Klein's comedy, but this autobiography left me without any better understanding of Robert Klein the man.I believe he may have made a mistake in not writing about Chinese pottery."
1,This Book Is Not Funny,"Robert Klein is a funny and gifted comedian; this book is not funny and not much in the way of a story. OK, so maybe my expectations were that this would be a humorous look at Klein's life. This book is more of a chronological look at Klein's upbringing with some interesting observations about a boy in New York in the 1950s. But, who cares? Klein does not bring much to the party; this could have been so much more."
1,Enough.,"I never finished this book and ditched it for all the reasons listed in the 1 and 2 star reviews. The book is vulgar and for the most part is all about Klein's sex life. Have you ever seen one of those Comedy Central videos that feature a really vulgar comic? When the camera pans to the audience showing people laughing their heads off at some disgusting joke, I am stunned that they find it funny. (I usually turn the video off at that point.) Maybe these are the people who enjoy reading a book like Klein's. It seems like everyone is writing a memoir these days. I wish publishing houses like Simon & Schuster would ""Just say no"" to the wannabe writers like Klein."
4,Wow! This Guy's Amorous,"[[0972338500-Galactically Speaking]]Robert Klein's always been one of my favorite comedians. So, I figured his memoir, ""The Amorous Busboy of Decatur Avenue"" would be: a) funny and 2) about sex, which it was. What I didn't expect was that many of Klein's reminiscences about coming of age in the 50's, his Animal Housean college years and his early days as an actor and comic to also be heartfeld and poignant. Although times have changed, people of all generations can relate to the intial angst and uncertainty of wading, diving or, in Klein's case, dipping a cautious toe into the turbulent sea of sexual relationships. TABODA (pronouced TABODA) is an entertaining, pleasant break from the gloom and doom of modern day life."
4,Robert Klein's Unique Perspectives,"Robert Klein's unique sense of humor makes for a great read...of course, it might be even more appealing to read his material if you are already a huge fan of his as I am. This book is not a ""laugh out loud"" type of book say like say an Al Franken book, but it's funny in other ways and quite enjoyable."
5,Original Memoir without the Schmaltz,"Robert Klein has written a suprisingly forthright, honest memoir with the jokes and schmaltz you are prepared to encounter in a comic's story. He gives rather a strtaightforward account of his growing up in the Bronx, going to school, college, working in Second City and in entertainment. He paints a rather realistic portrait of him family that will resonate with fellow Jews who come from similar backrounds.Very well written without the smart ass jokes I expected.Kudos to Mr,. KleinRick LertzmanAmassets@aol.com"
2,Nothing much in here,"Don't know what all the fuss is about with this movie. It's really not exciting, interesting or deep. The main character is despisable, but psychologically really simplistic. Some hard to digest scenes though for people who are sensitive to social suffering."
2,okay read,"Poorly written but a good message. I understand the heart of the book, though some better grammar would have made me happy."
3,pros and cons,Pros: comes with a blaster. easy to build. Tests power.5 nice games.part of this makes sure your shot doesn't misswhen trying out the meter.cons: It's unfair for coming with only 1 bdaball.The price is more than what it's actually worth.I still think this is nice.
1,What a piece of *%&!!!,The plastic pieces holding the toy together snapped after about 5 minutes.....the meter doesn't work.....a real waste of money!
3,A nice story for young children,"This fairy tale by George MacDonald is about a charming, but bewitched Princess, a Prince in disguise, some nice fairies, and one very bad one. It is easy to like the main characters. Children will enjoy the fact that the adults are rather foolish and even the bad witch is not really scary. This is a nice story for parents to read to young children and then discuss behaviors and conduct.Richard Pendleton"
3,Light Princess: good but not great,"Once I heard about The Light Princess, I ordered it because I buy everything by Robin McKinley, and I have a soft spot for George MacDonald (The Princess and the Goblin). I have not read the original of this, but wanted to see how McKinley would rewrite a classic tale.The book is pretty but not beautiful, and the story is charming but a bit flat to my taste. In addition, the final change in the princess from careless to concerned seemed unmotivated and hence not quite believable. I think it's a fine book to have in your library, but not worth chasing down too hard."
3,September Ended,"It is so hard to imagine the growth Green Day has became of over the years. They really have become a true example towards punk, all the way to contemporary rock. Their latest single is really no acception. Wake Me Up Before September Ends, the fourth single out from the 2004 highly-acclaimed American Idiot record, is a real tearjerker. The song is fairly well, but not one of those songs that stands out too much.I really liked the song at first, but it just became too much. It is a great turning point for Billy Joe and company, as they have shown their adult rock peers good music. As for the others, they'll just have to wait for another single, and this song to end.Song: C+"
3,Megatron is AWESOME!,"Well, I saw this in the Toysrus, and it was a pretty nice touch. It is pretty cool. I like the color scheme. Get him now!!!!!!"
5,Plain and Simple,"I needed a plain white hat for my Touko cosplay from Pokemon Black&White, and this was perfect. Great price, and you can't go wrong with it."
3,not bad,The bill hit my glass eye but I popped it in..... make sure to adjust the cap use the velcro strap.. l
2,Makes you sweat literally,"Used this when mowing the lawn really soaks up the heat even with a lighter color.I was drenched way to much under this hat and it wasn't really a hot day either.I mowed early AM,didn't make a bit of difference wouldn't buy again or recommend."
4,Comfortable,"Good Baseball Cap. I liked the velcro strip you could adjust in the back. It made it very convenient. Went well with the outfit I bought it for,"
3,Baseball Cap,"The cap at first glance looks nice and fits nicely also.Once you put it on things are a bit different.The brim is a bit longer than any other cap you have.The brim is also off center. When I first put the hat onand straightened it, with the vertical seam on the cap centeredwith my head, ""Things"" went differently. The right side of thebrim was touching the the top of my glasses and the left sidewas obviously 3/4 of an inch above my glasses. Both caps I orderedfit like this. Strange. I have had others try on the hats and theyalso see this problem."
4,adjustable velcro baseball cap,this cap is more than worth the price however it is a lightweight thin material which i would recommend for summer wear.
5,Bossa Nova,"I love Bossa Nova music. Playful, fun, peaceful. It took a flower sellers insight to tell Antonio Carlos Jobim that he was destined for greater things. It took a flower seller to see the genius of the man and the music. We have loved it ever since."
3,take the good with the bad,"Tom Jobim is one of the greatest composers of the 20th century. His compositions have a freshess and originality that are unmatched. He also played excellent piano and guitar. However, he had a wretched voice, almost always ""slightly out of tune"" (maybe that was what ""Desifinado"" was referring to!). Too bad. Listen to the great Elis Regina or Gal Costa (who is always in tune) sing Tom Jobim. Heavenly."
1,Perfect cure for insomnia,"The fact that a lot of people have already said that these track are ideal as background music should tell you something. I agree with them because the middle tracks sound a lot like muzak. If that is what you are looking for, this CD is for you. I bought this CD about a month ago and I've played it exactly once. I'm thinking about giving it a second chance and listening to it on my commute to work. However, I'm afraid I might fall asleep and drive off a cliff. There are a lot of good Bossa Nova cds out there. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Get Getz/Gilberto or Composer of Desafinado Plays,"This compilation here is a not-very-imaginative rehash of previously released material. The reason I gave it one star is not cause it['s bad], but because ALL of the songs here one can get in more attractive/comprehensive packages, such as: ""Getz/Gilberto"" (a masterpiece), ""Composer of Desafinado Plays"" (a cool record) or ""The Antonio Carlos Jobim Songbook"" compilation from Verve, which is really cool. So there! If you are really interested in Antonio Brasileiro, skip this one and go for the real deal."
4,fun and worthwhile,"This has become my new favourite. First of all, its lots of fun -- as a middle-aged woman who's only been working out for the past year or 2, I can keep up with (most of) the moves, and it makes me feel younger to learn funky moves and still get a great workout for my whole body.Sometimes the camera work is annoying -- focusing on faces and body shots without showing the footwork or the long-shots of bodies so you can see the movement -- but on the whole, it doesn't happen too often.I'd love more like this!"
4,Aerobics fan,"I just got this recently..looking for some other rotations for my aerobics workouts. Even though the styles are dated in the video, David Gray and his team show a lot of enthusiasm. You'll feel the leg toning at the end. The only negative aspects are the too long breaks between workout segments, and I didn't find the push-ups necessary for this format."
4,The power of free will,"To me the main theme of this book is the amazing powerful drive for free will in relationships. The grace is the gift of the acknowledgement of independence or free will through a private bank account or a statement that ""you were right, I was mistaken"".This is a book about the delicate balance of loving and caring and meeting the needs of others while holding onto the core of freedom. It is about honoring family history and learning from it. It is well worth reading, I enjoyed it."
4,The World Below,"Sue Miller knows characters. She knows how to build them so subtly that you feel like you knew them right from the start. That is what happens here with both Cath and her grandmother, Georgia. We learn about Georgia as a young woman, what she went thru in the sanitorium, her marriage, and her relationship with Cath. And we go through Cath's need to just get away from everything she knows in California and soak in her past in Vermont.Those looking for plot driven novels need not apply here. This is solely character driven and if you like these characters, you will fly through this one."
1,Utterly disappointing,"It was obviously a mistake to read The World Below right after Miller's big hit While I Was Gone. I cannot percieve how the very same writer could possibly have produced these two works. There's a WORLD of difference between them. While I Was Gone was vivid, dynamic, absorbing, worth reading and remembering. The World Below is downright mediocre. Dull. Deadly slow. Not wanting to leave it unfinished out of my respect for Miller's earlier works, I forced myself almost unsuccessfully to skim-read it. I just couldn't wait to start a new book!"
2,Underimpressive,Laborious to get through. Page skimming was the order of the day after the first half. Overly reflective.
3,The World Below,This book was a disappointment for me. The idea of the grandmother's diary was good. In fact the whole book would have been better to focus the story on just the grandmother. I found the main character boring and causing the story to drag. Also I was disappointed to see the four letter (F) word used several times. It seemed out of place in this kind of story. I love to loan out my books and to recommend books to others. This will not be one of them. I will also be more selective in the future when buying books written by this lady because of the profanity. It really ruined the book for me.
4,Interesting Parallel Stories,"This book is one of parallels. Cath is willed her grandmother's house and goes to stay there to figure her life out after 2 divorces and a general feeling of blah. While there, she finds her grandmother's (Georgia) diaries and reads them. She knew that her life was similar to her grandmother's but I don't think she realized how similar. Both of their mothers died while they were teens; both of them were sent away--Cath to her grandparent's house, Georgia to the sanitarium; both of them had troubled marriages.One thing I would suggest to everyone who reads this book is to pay attention to the diary entries. There is something eerie, in my view, with the way the weather is described. I don't know if it is really the weather, or if Georgia was commenting on something else.It is interesting to realize how misconceptions about what someone is saying and going through can drastically affect your life. This is a main theme behind this novel.I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Flawed and dull,"I've read all of Ms. Miller's books, but this one never really caught or held my attention. I guess I wasn't that interested in the Grandmother's story...and then when it hit present day, it seemed to be all talk, talk, talk. When Cath, the main character, first arrives at the home, it was interesting...but then nothing really happened. We get some of the Grandmother's backstory...then some of Cath's story and read over and over (and over) about her two flawed marriages. About page 120, I started to skim. And skim. And skim. To sum up, well-written (as always) -- just not very interesting, and really lacked narrative drive."
2,"gentle, but not compelling","Oh, I was disappointed, and I read all of Sue Miller. This is a then-and-now story, but it's simply slow. Very little ""happens."" The author does far too much ""telling"" and not enough ""showing."" And far too much ""seeming"" and ""feeling"" than actual doing. I made myself finish the book, but was relieved when it ended. Sue Miller is capable of much, much better."
2,Not a great read,"This isn't a great read. The story feels static. Nothing much happens. The narrator (Cath) goes on and on about her life now, her two failed marriages, her children (who are not well-developed characters), and her desire to learn more about her grandmother. The grandmother's story, unfortunately, isn't any more interesting. I kept waiting for the climax, the epithany, something, anything, to break up the monotony of the narrative, but it never came."
2,Not up to par,"Sue Miller seems to have written this when she was preoccupied with something else. Her imagination isn't put to work here, and the book is not up to her best writing. The novel isn't terrible, but it seems to be a half-hearted or failed effort."
2,Up . . . Up . . . Down . . Crash,While this book started out to be a good read . . . it just started going downhill after the woman arrives at her grandmother's house. To many generations to cover . . . some characters were not flesh out adequately . . . Not enough history . . . sex is overated . . . I just became bored . . . and as hard as I tried could not put myself through the pain of finishing this book.
5,Intriguing hystorical fiction,"This story was deep. Catherine goes on a journey through her grandmother's diaries, getting a picture of life in New England in 1910 and how it helps her perceive her own life in the present day. It was nice that she doesn't tie up the direction of the story, but rather leaves it to the reader."
2,Just too up in the air,"This book tries to jugle too many themes at once and ends up exploring none of them sufficiently. Your attention is jerked between the narrator's grandmother as a girl, the narrator as a girl, and the narrator as an adult. The book stretches too far to explore the experiences of each character, but never really gives a full picture of any of them. And the issues that the narrator *struggles* over are exagerated to the point of silliness: she's broken up with her husband (several years ago), her husband's new life, her daughter is having a baby, she is thinking of having an affair with an older man, her grandmother as a girl dealing with her mother's death, the grandmother's stay in a sanitorium, et cetera, et cetera... The book never settles long enough for one to enjoy it."
2,"Oprah's Book Club, here I come","This book was an awful introspective of a woman looking for her past and her future and her grandmother's past - all at the same time. It was one of those generation jumping books that can never pick a time or place. Don't read it, trust me, it's just not worth the effort."
4,Sue Miller's World,"I was lucky enough to get this book at the library before it hits the bestseller lists. I predict it will. I can also see it as a movie. Sue Miller explores the past and present, drawing parallels with the modern day Cath and her grandmother, Georgia. When Cath discovers her grandmother's diary, she is compelled to read it and fill in the blanks of her life. Learning from Georgia's past mistakes and also seeing how much alike their lives were, Cath comes to a deeper understanding of her own life. The allegorical submerged town under the lake illustrates poignantly the themes of the story. This well researched tale explores a part of history little known till now-the TB epidemic and life in the ""sans"". A compelling story, with many layers."
2,NOT ONE OF MILLER'S BEST!,"I usually enjoy Sue Miller's books, but not this one. Why? The plot was weak, lacked originality and the story itself was rather drawn out. It expressed lots of feelings and words, but at the same time, the story lacked action. We have read similar scenarios before where a family member dies, a divorce takes place causing one to return to their painful roots of childhood, and on, and on, and on. This book was no exception, it followed that same path and the author spent more time dwelling about the heartaches, pains and trauma of her past rather than focusing on any upbeat, positive drama. Many readers will probably say they enjoyed the book, but for me, it was just too much of the same old song and dance we read about so often these days; it lacked creativity and originality."
4,Plumbing Planet is great...,"I recently ordered the LTP-1 after my painter cleaned his brushes in my wash basin and clogged the motor. I realized though that I may need to order the LTA-1 since I don't have access to an external vent.Once I realized the above, I emailed Plumbing Planet after placing the LTP-1 order - their customer service rep called me directly in about 1 hour and, after explaining my situation, the rep told me that the unit may not be functioning because it just may need to be cleaned out. Sure enough I opened it up, cleaned it out and the pump works again - there was a ton of junk in there from the previous home owner as well. Plumbing Planet quickly canceled my order.I will be sure to use Plumbing Planet in the future."
1,Magellan= false advertising=spend more $$$,"Was the BIGGEST waste of money was told the GPS Gold (219.99)had topo built-in. It came with a topo screen cover.BULLSH-T had to buy MORE programs.have spent over three hundred bucks and DAMN did I get RIPPED OFF! MAGELLAN your COMPANY SUCKS!IF you havn't bought one yet,check into another brand."
2,overpriced and unsupported,"I bought the Explorist which I am generally happy with, but this software is lousy and there is no product support for it on the website. The version I have 2.0 has not been updated to work well with the Explorist, and the 64MB limitation is a pain when you have a 512MB SD card. In general, the routing works but the interface is nowhere near as good as Streets and Trips."
1,Waste of Money!!,"I truely wish I had found the prior reviews for this product before I bought it. Unfortunately, I am now stuck with a product that will not start and will not run on my pc, running WinXP2!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! Support sucks all around and there appears to be no fix now or in the near future to get software working...I lost $100 bucks on this one!!!"
2,Doesn't support Explorist GPS units,"This software does NOT support the Explorist series from Magellan. For that you need Magellan DirectRoute v3.0, which is part number 980654-04. Amazon doesn't currently carry that version. If you have an Explorist, do not buy this, go elsewhere and get the correct version.If you have an older Magellan GPS, this should work just fine."
4,Good software for the price.,I bought the mapsend software to use with my Explorist 210. It installed without any problems (windows XP) and works fine with the Explorist 210. The program is very easy to understand and it uploads detailed maps to the unit with no problems. I had a question before I ordered the software and was pleased to talk with Magellen support in the USA and not someone overseas.
3,No Problems with my Explorist,"I was surprised by some of the reviews. I have used both version 3 and version 2 (offered here) on my Explorist without a problem. It appears from the Magellan web site that version 2 is the only software being offered at this time and I know that some users prefer version 2 to version 3. Version 3 did have better support for geocaching, but other than that, I am not sure that I noticed much of a difference.To use this with the Explorist, you do have to go through extra steps, saving it to the hard disk and then transferring it over to the unit.At one time, Magellan stated that there would be yearly updates. Hardly. This version is long overdue for one. And since the Explorist does not support automatic re-routing, the mapping is more cumbersome than the Garmins. Although this has gotten me where I need to go, if I am driving somewhere I generally pull out the Garmin. There are tricks out there that eliminate the need to always have the cd in the drive when it is used."
3,"It's ok, wish it was updatable","I wish it was possible to update the maps, as in update to current maps, live download, what roads are different since I bought the software. As far as I've been able to find the maps the CD came with are the only map I'm 'allowed' access to. :-("
2,Low rating due to unlock process and poor customer service,I've owned the new V.3 product for over a week and have still not been able to unlock it for use. Customer service is worse than I've ever experienced. They won't commit to calling me back and have suggested that someone will be working on the problem and I should continue to keep trying the unlock process until it works.
3,Everyone complaining about this not being the new edition,"Amazon does not claim that this is the newest version of Mapsend. It claims nothing. It is selling the item Magellan 980654-03 DirectRoute North America. It is not their duty, in my opinion, to tell you which version of Mapsend you need. Mapsend sells this product at reduced price on their website, but they also sell the Mapsend 3.0 (product number 980654-04, which Amazon currently does not stock--which you can find out by simply searching for Magellan 980654-04 on Amazon), which is the newest version. Amazon has not been dishonest in any way in selling this product. Maybe those who are unhappy after purchasing this dated software should have spent five more minutes finding out which software they actually needed."
1,Magellan 980654-03 DirectRoute North America,Very slow and hard to use. What a waste of my money. Should have purchase a different product.
2,Good news - bad news,"I purchased this software for use with my Meridian Gold GPS and Thinkpad. It would sometimes not recognize the data CD in my DVD/CDR drive. I found that rebooting the computer would fix the problem most of the time. I kept using the software because it is very good and very easy to use. However, a couple of days ago, the software refused to run at all - not even the splash screen. Magellan support was no help. Told me the problem might be a firewall or a resource conflict. Tried various things for several hours, but no luck. Will probably chuck the software and buy a Garmin."
2,SW Won't Run on all Computers,"I have a fairly new computer (Fujitsu S7110 laptop) and this SW won't run on it. It installs without any error. Clicking on the program icon results in nothing happening.As a test I installed it on my desktop (a CyberpowerPC) and it runs just fine.But, I need it on my laptop, not my desktop. It doesn't do me any good while on the road to be running on my home machine.I called tech support and they basically had me disable all the boot time software and services and, yes, the software does run. But is that really a solution? It's more like a kludge. The software has issues and Magellan doesn't want to admit it.The Magellan web site hints that version 2.0 of DirectRoute won't run on all DVD drives, but they don't provide a solution.I asked if they would upgrade me to version 3.0 and they said no.This software was essentially a waste of money for me."
1,Piece of junk,These maps are horrible. Save yourself some time and money and buy a Garmin. The Garmin maps are 100 times better.
1,Willard's Water for conjunctivitis in cats,"I purchased this because several articles online said that it would dramatically improve conjunctivitis in a cat due to chronic herpes.It didn't do anything, even though it was the cat's only water source for about 4 weeks.On the other hand, antiviral eye drops did help.So, the long and short about Willard's water is...if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!"
4,good,"As advertised, diluted with water as suggested, used a spray bottle and it worked great for spots where my dog was obsessively licking off fur."
1,Why Was my Review Deleted?,"Mine was one of the earlier reviews posted for this book, noticing that there is only nine reviews here, it doesn't seem for want of space.perhaps it was because there were so many overwhelming negative reviews for this book and someone there felt the need to beef up the ratings?I also notice that a bogus anti-christian tirade from someone claiming to be author Nathaniel Merritt is still here, even though it looks like it isn't even him. You keep this goofy review but delete mine?"
3,A Riviting Theory,"I first read this book many years ago and found the theory fascinating. The idea is that Jesus, who firmly believed he was the Messiah, set out to follow the biblical prophesies to the bitter end. The author suggests even though Jesus' motivations were sincere, he tried to hedge his bets though the timing of his arrest and crucifixion. The book contains many citations of authority to back up its claims and the theory seems certainly possible. Each reader will need to make up his/her mind. Its well worth the read."
4,They run small,I ordered the XXL size and really have a hard time getting my hand into the gloves. The Mechanix brand XXL fit me better. I do have big hands but expect XXL to fit. I am hoping that these loosen up a bit as I use them they seem well made.
5,Good.,"This is a good album by MTV before MTV became all those TV shows and all about seriousness. This features many songs by famous artists at the time but not their major songs because if they wanted the big songs they would have picked ""Straight Up"" by Paula Abdul or ""What's On your Mind"" by Information Society. It features songs by artists that maybe no one has ever heard of which is good because we all need different music. I recommend this album. It is what made MTV famous in the first place."
4,The Secret in Building 26,"An interesting and well written book. This story covers a little known chapter of the history of World War II and America's part in solving the German code problem. While the British developed the procedures, America was able to create better and faster decoding equipment that assisted both countries in solving the problem."
5,Awesome Book!,Tim and Pete is certainly the best gay-themed fictionI've ever read. The story concerns two ex-lovers andthe day/night they spend together on the streets of L.A..An apocalyptic AIDS-era adventure. This book is tops
5,One of the best books I've read,"I love this book! Its totally unusual and ungaurded. Tim & Pete is a great book and I recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor. Its great all together, although the end does get a little weird, but its totally worth it. Once you start reading it you can't stop!"
5,Searing Expose,"This searing novel rips the lid off the world of rap and hip-hop. It goes behind the scenes to show you how much repressed homoeroticism there really is in this self-hating, gay-bashing genre. Tells it like it is. You want the truth? You can't HANDLE the truth! Oh, yeah, there's also lots of other stuff involving gay anarchists and on-the-road antics, but it's the rap revelations that resonate."
5,unforgettable,"I first read this book when I was fifteen, and five years later, I still love to read it all over again. It has never lost its appeal to me. ""Tim and Pete"" has the best damn dialogue I've read in a long time - it's sarcastic and witty, and you'll feel like you're living the characters' lives in no time. This book is funny and subversive, and has more than enough black humor to make a conservative person have a heart attack. I recommend ""Tim and Pete"" to anyone who's ever felt out of place or rejected in this world, be it male or female, gay or straight."
5,Rare breed and great read,"What a book! The author has packed in one of the most eventful days one could ever imagine, and yet makes it all highly plausible.Most of the other reviewers here seem to have gotten the same basic idea, except that Kirkus guy(gal?) - who seems highly subjective in his interpretation.And, heterophobia? I've only seen raging homophobes use that word - clearly he was unprepared and unable to grasp the fundamentals of the book he's reviewed.Anyway, Tim & Pete is a terrific, powerful, hopeful and at the same time believable read. Read this book - it's a true antidote to the insipid schlock that would win the approval of William Bennett."
2,Quality not what expected,"This bed was so attractive in the pic, but while putting it together, we found it was not very good quality. The screws are not all done with the hidden fasteners, so you have screw heads showing on the surface areas. Also, some of the wood split when we installed the screws, and the drawers do not fit flush to the surface. Too heavy to ship back though."
2,"My cat was not comforted, nor was I","If you have a more sensitive breed or who is extremely picky about smells, new things, etc., try some Bach's Rescue Remedy liquid in the water dish. This product will be a gamble for breeds like my rag doll Burmese."
4,Expensive but it's good,I started using rene furterer products for almost 3 months and I can really see a difference in my hair. The complexe 5 is a must.
2,I did not care for it,I bought this with a kit. This stuff was just not worth it to me. But unlike the others I cannot stand the smell. It is very strong and gave me a headache so I could not really leave it on that long. My scalp did feel conditioned though. But if you are sensitive to strong smells be aware that this stuff may bother you.
1,Ouch!!!!! Burned like crazy.,This product felt like it was burning my scalp when it was on a couple minutes. Got worse with water And I had to rinse a lot until I could get it alll out and the burning stopped. I don't have sensitive skin and have a pretty tough scalp And this was a miserable experience. hope I can get my money back.
3,unsure about this product too!!!!,"I also haven't used this product for the full requested time. I don't see results after a month of use, but I'm hopeful that after three months I will benefit from it. I must say, however, that the smell is a bit powerful. Other than that, I'm determined to use it to achieve all the benefits. Jury is out on this one also!!!!"
3,don't know the effect,"I am using shampoo in the same brand, and ordered this with it.I just don't see the difference.I might need more time."
5,Beautiful Illustrations,I purchased this book primarily for the illustrations. They are absolutley magnificant. The story is fun too. I was disapppointed that this was the small hardbook for younger children. I thought it was the larger size. I recommend purchasing the larger size to appreciate the illustrations.
5,Funny Story and Pictures!,"This is one of my favorite books in the world. I love to read it at bedtime, lunchtime, and quiet time. I learned to recite it at age 4 and still love it. The picutrues are so funny, they make me laugh... not a good idea at quiet time (hee hee hee)!"
5,Book most enjoyed and repeatedly read by my kids (and me),Both of my daughters (now aged 18 and 11) have thouroughly enjoyed the intriguing illustrations and clever verse of The Napping House. I think it is the single most read book in our house. We all had a good time searching for the flea on each page. It's easy to learn and have the children repeat with you as you read. The pictures are compelling. The complete package keeps children and adults alike coming back for repeat readings.
5,"Large, durable format","This is one of my favorite read-a-loud books-- great for a soothing bedtime story. There is a traditional-sized board book on the market, but it's so small that the illustrations are shrunk too much to see. Buy this edition instead of the full-size hardback if you have a drooler/gnawer."
5,This is a must read for all ages!!!!!!!!!,The book is about a family and the animals who live in a house. When it is time to go to bed the Grandma starts sleeping and then the kid and so on. My favorite part of the book is the pictures. They are funny and make you laugh as you read the book. I would recommened this book for all ages because it has a theme for all ages.
3,"A nice book for young children, stupid for older children.","I am ten and I read this book. The pictures are pretty good, but the wording was stupid. It said the same thing over and over but just added one thing on every page. This book is just for kids who are learning how to read."
1,A Real Snoozer,"My child loves many books, but this one loses him every time. Perhaps he is bored by the monotonous illustrations that focus on one room, adding a small detail on every new page? Perhaps it is the repetitive sing-songy verse? Uninspiring."
1,Not Satisified,I was not happy with this seller. The book arrived in terrible condition- worse than a library book. We have checked this out many times from library and wanted to own it. I was very disappointed with color quality and the condition of the book. I contacted the seller to return it and they did not respond in a helpful way - they said I needed to call them or respond to the email again telling them the problem- but I had already told them the problem. Not happy and will never buy from them again. Get it from Amazon or your local bookstore- then you will know what you are getting and if it's not great when it arrives- AMazon always takes it back! Frustrated
2,"""New"" not necessarily a true statement when searching for books!","I ordered this book with the impression that it was ""New"". When it arrived, the paper cover was torn on the corners and the cover as well as pages in the book looked sun faded. It smelled as though it had been sitting in a attic for years. Had this been a book just for my own kids I would have been able to look past the fading of the pages but it was a gift for my niece which I felt horrible about giving to her. It just looked cheap and I suppose I should have just bought it brand new at a store."
4,Not sure at first but warmed up quickly,"My son was not very interested in this book the first few times we read it to him, but it quickly became one of his favorites. I enjoy the beautiful illustrations and the easy way the repetitions flow. My son enjoys hearing me make the animals bark, meow, and squeak and the grandma snore after each respective line. I am glad we bought this book. We read it before almost every nap and bed time."
5,The Napping House,LOVED the book our grand children had so much fun with this book. The second and third time through they enjoyed finding the flea and the excitement that it brought to the story. Read it and ENJOY it.
5,One of our favorite books,"When I purchased this board book, I didn't realize it would quickly become one of MY favorite books, too! My children loved the predictive nature of the narrative and looking for the flea on each page, but I loved the beautiful illustrations and sweet nature of the story. This is one I will be saving for my grandkids although I might need to get another copy...we kind of wore ours out! :) ""Read it again, Mommy!"""
3,Just ok according to my kids.,"When I read this book to my kids they were not impressed. It is a cute story, but I don't know what is so great about it."
2,THe Napping House,"I love the Woods. The illustrations here are beautiful as ever; if a little subtle (unlike some other titles of theirs). They are also a little monotonous since almost the entire book takes place in the same room, same colors, same details with just one extra character subtly introduced on each page. My 22 month old is not impressed - maybe he's too young for this one. He LOVES 'Quick as a Cricket' and 'The Alphabet Adventure'."
5,The Napping House: Book and Musical CD,The Napping House is my all time favorite book to give to new moms and grandmas!! It's fun to read and the illustrations are absolutely delightful!! A MUST HAVE for all young people's libraries!!
5,A delightful romp!,"This is another classic by the husband and wife team of Don & Audrey Wood. What happens when a wakeful flea interrupts naptime? Read this wonderful story and find out. The soft colors of the nappping house when all are sleeping is wonderfully contrasted with the bright colors of a wakeful house. Brilliant! This is a great book for either quiet times, or silly times. Infants & up can't get enough of The Napping House. And neither can I!"
4,Nice and spicy,"I prefer the taste of the hot and spicy to the milder variety of Juanita's and it seems to contain a larger proportion of tripe than the smaller can of the mild. To cut the salt content per serving and stretch my budget, I add some pinto beans to the menudo."
4,Good Variety,"If you have not had Sahale Snacks before this is a good why to try them all. If you do however, you may be better off getting just those kinds that you like, as they are all quite different."
5,Inspired snacking,"I'm placing my second order for the variety pack because I liked every flavor and appreciated the variety. All have a sensational blend of flavors--spicy, sweet, salty--without being overpowering. Truly delicious and healthy munchables. I'm so glad I decided to try out a package in my supermarket."
1,Maybe it's just me,"I din't love these at all. The flavor combinations struck me as off, there was no improvement in the pistachio taste by adding harissa. Also the texture was unpleasant, somewhat soggy. I like the healthy aspect, but if you aren't enjoying the experience why eat at all?"
1,Sahale snacks,"The case was missing a whole bag of snacks. Couldn't get a hold of any kind of customer service, and nobody responded to my e-mails."
2,Aging snacks,"I first purchased the brand from Target where I found delicious and fresh tasting bags. I liked the interesting and unique blends and the prices were acceptable. I tried a couple of individual bags from Amazon and found similar quality, so I ordered a subscription of the series of blends. Bad move - I've not found a fresh bag since - each arrives in a extremely dry condition, odd, since these appear to be vacuum-packed, but I'm losing interest in maintaining the subscription. I'm giving it one more month, but if I get another batch that appears to have sent to me via 1923 then I'm off to the nearest Target to beg with the Food Department Manager to increase their selection."
3,Shale snacks,Tried the variety pack. So I was able to taste all the different flavored snacks. They were good but not great and for the price they should be great. I doubt I will buy them again unless they were on a very good sale.
5,One Great Snack,"I first discovered these wonderful snacks at Target. When they quit carrying them I went ""nuts"". I searched the internet and finally found them here at Amazon. I can't tell you how great these snacks are. I plan to have them delivered on a regular basis. You've got to try these snacks. Get the variety pack and choose your favorites."
2,Misleading product image,"When I purchased this item, there was no way to know that I was buying only one brush, and even if I had known, there was no option as to which of the pictured brushes I wanted. The image for this product is very misleading! (By the way, the brush this item refers to is the smallest one shown.)"
2,RS brushes are poorly made,I bought several Robert Simmons Sapphire brushes after my watercolor teacher said she used and like them. I did not have a problem with the brush and how it works to paint but the handles are terrible. With normal use the blue paint breaks off and the brush head comes loose from the metal to the point where the brush is unusable. This happened to all the RS brushes I purchased. A very poorly constructed brush. I would not recommend it to anyone.
4,Thomas Jefferson Mystery/Great scholarly romp,"A who done it about when where and if?? This is a literary mystery, ya gotta love that, Everyone trying to prove or disprove what Thomas Jefferson Did or didn't do?? Written by a Jeffersonian scholar ,this is an entertaining and fun book, I was really surprised... So If your a history buff this will be great bed time reading. Like the CSI investigation of a great man of history."
4,One of the pilars of rap,"You can almost make a game of picking out Parliment Funkadelic samples. Thats just one thing that makes this album fun. D.U. can flow like most dream to. Dflo Shuttle gets the groove going. Heartbeat Props makes a point that the living need as much respect as those who have passed on. In No Nose Job, Humpty leads the march in a track he made famous by pickiting cosmetic surgery establishments. D.U. keeps it going with Kiss You Back, Tales of the Funky, and a Dflo instrmental. The beats don't stop there, cause you're going to want to listen to it over and over again. No need for metallic frost bite preventiteve blizzard suits or helicopters. Just pure Hip-Hop P-Funk class."
2,Not such a great bone,"There is not too much meat on this bone. Now that the small amount of meat is was chewed off, the dog has no interest in it anymore. I would try the free range knuckle bone instead. My dog has been chewing on that one for days!"
2,OUT OF DATE!!!!,"This book really needs to be updated. Due to the publishing date, the trails described are difficult to reach using the directions in the book and the trails do not match the descriptions. For example, the book shows the Burke-Gilman trail ending at 12.5 miles, but it now goes 27+ miles, all the way to Redmond. Similarly, the Green River trail is one of the best trails in the region, but this book hardly mentions it. I like exploring dead ends and getting lost, but updating this book would make it much easier to use."
5,Another wonderful story by Neels,"I am a steadfast Neels fan and own ALL of her books, even the anthologies. This is one of my favorites which I've read many time, and my heart still aches at certain places, as well as, soars with glee in other places. I love how Judith and her eminent writer dislike each other at the start, but his mother, who is not well, recognizes that they would be good for each other and sets the stage for their ultimate happy ending. Their journey towards discovering how much they care for one another is a fun read peppered with Neels' style of tender care for an ailing person, hero/heroine's pride and stubbornness clashing, misunderstandings, and ultimately, the realization of love."
1,Warning - may corrupt your files,"I have recently notified Dane-elec of a situation where this reader may corrupt your files if using a large SD card (I have a 4GB pqi card). I would caution anyone considering this unit try it before they purchase, or ensure you can return it. And please verify the actual files are all internally consistent before you delete them from your original SD card !!! I will update this posting as I get more info."
1,Corrupted my media cards,"I've had this reader for maybe 4 months. Worked fine until this past month when suddenly one of my microdrives became corrupt. I figured it failed. Then - the same day, a second microdrive was corrupted. Put in a 1 gig smartcard and wham, it's corrupt too. Diagnosed it to this reader - have no problem with the cards once we paid to have our images retrieved and reformatted them and stopped using this reader."
3,Nice in the shop but....,"They are large and heavy to tote around in the toolbox. The need for them is rare but when you do, you won't want anything else. They clamp into the fork knockouts and the alignment wheels adjust in for precise adjustments. The handles are very heavy and can easily handle the stress."
4,World Wide Popular book,"This series are consiered as Bible of passing CPA exam. Specially in Japan, most of school uses them as text for lectures."
2,Beware ...it is only 30 mins (Not 90) and quality is Poor,I was looking forward to this dvd and it was very dissapointing.. like the previous post said it is very poor quality footage and it is just bits and pieces... to make it worse.. it is NOT 90 Minutes as they claim but a mere 30 minutes.... Hardly worth the 29.99 pricewant mine?? email me.... this is trash !!!
3,"Loved the book, until the end",I really enjoyed this book up until the end. It still upsets me that I invested so much time in this book to have it end like that. I think the whole ending sounds like a soap opera....
1,Not 2 Great,"It's my own fault for not paying attention. I thought I was getting the Green Hornet with Bruce Lee and Van Johnson. Instead I got the original radio show. I tried to watch, but it just got annoying hearing that buzzing from the hornet. Maybe someone in their 60s would enjoy it more, or maybe I'll re-gift it."
4,Film's first Green Hornet,"Gordon Jones is the stalwart masked crimefighter in this snappy 13-chapter Universal serial. Young Keye Luke is Kato, the Hornet's omnicompetent friend/valet/sidekick. Wade Boteler's comic ""Mike Axford"" grows tiresome, Anne Nagel is wasted, but Jones and Luke are unfailingly engaging and things move at a smart pace. Serial, presented here in a terrific restoration, marked first screen appearance of the Hornet, who debuted on radio in 1937. A '37 Lincoln Zephyr serves as the 200-mph Black Beauty. Two-disc set includes two episodes of the radio serial, photo gallery, restoration comparison, short producer bio and an unhelpful 8-minute audio feature. Recommended."
3,Much potential to be fulfilled on a later disc,O.P.P. in my opinion had to be the dance record of the year. But unfortunately after that much of the material is fairly mundane. The few exceptions have to include Everything's gonna be alright and Uptown Anthem. This disc showed incredible potential that would later be realized with the Poverty's Paradise CD.
1,Wasn't what I expected,"I expected to like it more. I liked 2 songs. I must be getting old because back in the day, I remember this CD rocking."
4,The Only Book on Cozumel We Found,"Great reference for the island of Cozumel with a lot of detailed hints (reads like someone's diary). And as far as we've found, the author is right: Cozumel is usually a small blip in books dedicated almost solely to Cancun (or the entire Yucatan Peninsula). If you're spending more than one day on the island, definitely worth it."
4,Still Worth Getting Great Book,"I tend to disagree with the most recent review of this book. I have been a LONG TIME part time resident of the Island, since 1987. I purchased this book for use by my guests, and have actually used it myself. I agree there are a few editorial errors, and some just barely out of date information, but 95%% of this book is valuable information, with out of the way dining options, that would seldom be found on the internet, and small shops who also do not find their way to the internet or printed guidebooks. Guidebooks are a difficult thing to keep current to the minute, as by the time it prints there are already changes. Used in conjuction with the Cozumel Can Do map, this is a terriffic resource."
4,good information,"I bought this book because I have a trip planned to Cozumel in a few months. And as others have found, you cannot find a book dedicated solely to Cozumel, just a chapter or two, so this book has great info. However, I was disappointed that there were no color pictures or more of them! Pictures would be much more helpful, especially when listing beaches. All-around good buy, though."
2,Full of factual errors,"I have been a Cozumel resident for five years. I had the opportunity to view this guide book last week for the first time. While it appears to those who are unfamiliar with the island as a wonderful resource, buyer beware. There are numerous errors in the book which include but are not limited to: incorrect phone numbers, website addresses, e-mail addresses, improper spellings of establishments, and establishments that no longer exist...one in particular has not existed in over five years!The author has good intentions, but she did not do her homework and did not do a thorough fact check before publishing this book."
3,Not impressed.,"This book is ok, but not the best. Read Pedro Alcantara's Indirect Procedures for better info. Also, Patrick MacDonald's The Alexander Techinique As I See It."
4,Does more than just point you to a teacher,"This is the first book I ordered regarding the alexander technique and I have found it to be very useful. I am generally put off by books that only scratch the surface and give you only enough to make you want to contact a teacher - which seems to be the hidden agenda by all of these books published by alexander teachers - but this book does more. Some of the content is a bit fluffy, but a great deal is very useful and can give you the opportunity to get a start on your own. With a simple change to how to carry your head as described in the book - I have already seen a significant reduction in my back pain."
3,Learn Alexander technique,"This is what it says. I don't recommend it for the ""average person."" It really is set up for students of the technique."
3,A solid quick reference,"This pictorial and descriptive reference is a great size to tuck in my purse. Because I was expecting a more elaborate book, I gave the paper back 3 stars."
5,This set is the best!!,"This was the first rave set I ever bought and, it is, by far, the best. I have yet to buy a set with so many great tracks on it. Every song is amazingly beautiful. If you are new to rave or have been in the scene awhile, this set should be the first on your list. You WILL be begging for more.RAVE ON - - - PLUR"
4,"great set, the beats flow and all ravers should get it.","very intense speed mixed with skill makes this the ultimate dance party music, I think its awsome."
5,"Great product, fast shipping (not from ups though!)","The hat fit well and shipping was fast (after ups decided to ship my package, my order was filled and sent within 1 day)"
5,A story of truth,"If you have entered into your healing phase, or know someone who has, then you will be able to relate to this book, and will want to share it with others on the path. Caila, a mud child, with her connection to truth, takes a journey down the healing waters and meets the mother/father spirit of the falls. Just like on our own healing journey, she has to own her false self, with its destructive messages, and to take ownership for all her choices. As the memories are exposed, she becomes what she always was, a beautiful be ing.Take this journey down the river with Caila, and remember what you have already gone through to get this point in your life, and hold the gratitude deep in your heart. For it is when we can trust others, as well as ourselves, that we will be able to share our deep inner love that will transform the world."
3,"""So that's what reefers look like!""","The Gene Krupa Story plays at times more like a Lenny Bruce sketch (""So that's what reefers look like!"") with Sal Mineo coming over like Martin Scorsese on speed as the first superstar drummer, James Darren proving that he's no singer while Red Nichols is at least 30 years too old to play himself. At times almost aiming to be a Catholic version of The Jazz Singer (even though Krupa's family behave like classic Jewish stereotypes), it's formulaic, watered down stuff, both factually and musically, but not without some undemanding entertainment value, not to mention a likeable performance from Susan Kohner as the good girl who stands by him. And Susan Oliver's hophead singer gets a great exit line: ""Excuse me, but I've got a town to get out of."""
5,I love accompied drums Gene Krupa was the best,"Gene Krupa an artest on solo & accompanied drums He always enjoyed his work, He had a real instink for that kind of sound it seemed almost automatic but you could feel his emotions in his presentation.Beautiful."
4,The Gene Krupa Story,"It was a very good picture, it wasn't the Gene Krupa story that I was expecting but it was still very good. Very impressed that there was no bad language in it.Also purchased these movies due to my mothers maiden name was Krupa."
2,Many Old Films Are Like Movies Of A Play,"I don't like Plays, so I didn't like this delivery.I will say this, Amazon made a copy to fill my order and I got an excellent quality Video Disc."
4,iF YOU LOVE kRUPA,"The acting is not great & the story is full of half-truths & the usually hollywood coloring.However if you love Krupa, swing. & drums as I do you will probably get off on this movie. The drums were recorded by Krupa himself so at least that part is true to life. You won't get to know the man but I think the music & talent he possessed will shine through the hollywood glitter."
4,GENE KRUPA STORY,"Any film that features Gene Krupa and Shelly Manne on the track is worth seeing. It would have been nice to have more music included, such as the songs that featured Roy Eldridge, as well as Anita O'Day. Sal Mineo carried off the Krupa role with great style. For swing fans, it's a ""must see.""Tony Horowitz[...]"
3,the gene krupa story dvd,"This was an expensive dvd but I didn't mind too much as it was a gift for my father. However VERY disappointed to be charged another 12.75 customs/handling charge when it was delivered. I think the seller could have warned me about this and I definitely would not have purchased it had I known first (- just under 50 in total for a used dvd !). Also, I don't understand why it needs to takes nearly a month for delivery. DVD seem fine but a disappointing transaction."
2,Sal's Face and O'Day's Singing Best Features of this Flick,"Hackneyed, boring, predictable. I'm a bit surprised by the positive reviews of this lame flick. Sal's acting rings false, but the guy sure had charisma and looks. Particulary his well-shaped mouth. I actually found his ""drumming"" far more convincing than his singing, though he moves so quickly, who can say whether he's hitting the snare or the cymbal at the same moment you're hearing those sounds? Anita O'day's too-brief moment in this film was a tragic lapse of judgement on the part of all involved with the making of this movie. She is the most authentic thing going for this film. Why they kept her in the background in her only scene is a mystery--the woman emanates jazz and her own unique brand of sex appeal."
3,what you want ...,ok this is what you want to see oooooolllaaallla ouchy ...now whats the idea ....alright thats what a stooge nuckle head says but iwill dio it in a comparison to a flynn flic its near or at montana as far as a musical instrument goes quickened forgibenmns...th th th thirsty cups we sbe ....shdfh...
4,this movie is a classic,"if you like bigfoot movies, this was one of the first. The story is kinda slow, but when bigfoot arrives, it is awesome."
2,classic childhood memory - but not a great movie,"I saw this once in the theatre, way back in the day, when I was 7. It terrified both my 10 year old sister and I, and for a good several weeks she would not go to the bathroom without having me stand by the door outside in case 'bigfoot' was going to attack her through the window. Can't imagine anyone but us remembers this movie unless they had the same funny memory that keeps getting a laugh every few years.It came used and was VERY affordable, so I was able to pre-view it. While the DVD was excellent in condition, the video quality is poor, and the story is extremely slow. More documentary than anything, and not terribly engaging. It's not a great film overall but has been a funny memory between my sister and I for decades. I HAD to buy it for her, and will give it as a gift for her birthday in a few weeks. Can't wait to see her face when she opens it!"
3,Dated but Lookworthy,"Lensed in documentary style, ""Legend of Boggy Creek"" uses real residents and ""recreations"" to weave the tale of a Bigfoot like critter that terrorizes an Arkansas swamp town. Sometimes this film looks very Disney-esque or something out of a 60's ""Wild Kingdom"" episode and the narrative style complete with accompanying music will look and sound very hokey to many. Nature lovers will appreciate the wildlife footage that pads the film.Real chills are short though, and in the end the whole film is no scarier than an elementary campfire story."
4,"Great Transfer, Now Let's Find the Real Thing!","I played the baby in the orange jacket and supplied most of the soundtrack by crying (won't tell you the tricks they played to upset me...) and my father, John Ball, was the art director. Needless to say, I really, really, really would like to see an original anamorphic print, or at least see a transfer to DVD from one (I've combed eBay for 16mm prints with no luck). This was taken from a nice print and I agree - the best transfer available. Thanks for all the great comments and reviews! My father (no longer living) would have gotten a real kick out it - he was proud of the film's ""look"". Aaron Ball (credited ""Baby"")"
1,No Review - Bad Amazon Service = Not Receiving Product Yet,"I bought this movie over a month ago and still have not received it. They sent it to the wrong address (mu old address) and knew this before they sent it. But their remedy was to wait until it gets returned to them. The people that live in my old house probably could give you a review because I am sure they kept it and watched. So, I am little pissed at Amazon because I know I am not going to ever see this movie through them. Thanks for nothing Amazon."
1,NEVER RECEIVED MY ORDER,"Well let's see , the vendor says they shipped my order but I never received it. It would have been nice if they had sent me a reply to one of my e-mails to let me know when(or if) it had been shipped. I've been waiting since 2/23/09 for this DVD and now Amazon.com is going to refund my $$. Better communication needed from the vendor. I'm not impressed at all."
3,Not DVD Quality,"I purchased this to find out what was in the missing 3 minutes of another version I have (87 vs 90 minutes). While this DVD included the missing footage, the quality was poor for a DVD. It also had a different cover than what was pictured on the web site."
1,BOGGY PAN & SCAN,"I was excited to pick this DVD up recently, but became less excited when I started viewing it. Unfortunately, this Techniscope (2.35:1 AR) film has been released in a pan & scan (full screen) presentation only. Just a warning to widescreen diehards."
5,"Corny, but classic","I'll never forget the first time I saw this movie, we rented it and it terrified me and my brother, my brother is still scared of it lol. After searching everywhere for it I finally broke down and bought it off the net, now I can enjoy it whenever I want, both funny and some parts are scary too, at least they are the first time you see it. If you are interested in the Sasquatch/bigfoot phenomenon this movie is a must-have."
3,disappointed in a way,"I thought this was a movie I remembered from a fright night feature, but it wasnt!!! All te same it was told from a documentry style, the people in it { I HOPE!} were not actors but truely country folks, talking/ reliving the events [ so it seemed]I had to deduct at least 2 stars simply for the goofy song they sing in the middle of it. good scenery, not a great movie but something unique for the discerning viewer. I actually liked The creature at black lake better. It was fictional but entertaining!"
4,the legend of boggy creek,"good movie , more of a folks lore tale but good movie , a 1070 movie for real , good price"
3,Not well done,I'm not sure how this was recorded but picture quality is pretty bad. My husband loved this as a kid and wanted this as a gift. It was not a very nice gift.
3,The rest of the story,"I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and loved it. I recently had the chance to meet Smokey Crabtree and purchase his books - Smokey and the Fouke Monster and Too Close to the Mirror. The book really gave a lot of insite in to what Fouke, Ark endured with the making of the movie and what has become of the small community. I strongly recommend that if you liked the movie, read the books - they will have you laughing. Smokey has a website - it's smokeyandthefoukemonster.com"
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I had seen a Boggy Creek movie in the past involving some people in a camper trailer in the woods and also another scene with several people going down a river in an aluminum boat to an old cabin beside the river to talk to an old guy where the creature came around his cabin, etc.Well, neither of the two Boggy Creek videos I have are the right ones and this one and the other with a similar cover are not so very interesting to me.(If anyone knows which version I have described above I would appreciate you dropping me some correct info. Thanks)"
3,"Saw this late night when I was young, now it's just funny","Well so much for everything I loved as a kid being as good today. This ""Documentary"" is very funny now and the stories it tells are beyond belief. Worth a look for the laughs."
5,"Bigfoots Coming Gonna Get Ya!!, Gonna Get Ya!!","This is a classic B-rated film, no known actors really except for the old hermit that is in the film(made some cowboy movies as well, back in the day!) This is a silly story about the Bigfoot or Faulk Monster from the Tex Arkana area etc... If you just watch it for fun, which I hope you do, it's really not that bad. It's a little scary, but not a gory bloodbath like so many mindless films that have been made/& released since this light-hearted flick. If you don't sit and overly critique this film to death it's quite enjoyable. It is almost always sold out even on Amazon,(that's because it has become a real cult classic!!) I highly recommend this film on a quiet, windy night at home alone/or with a friend...ENJOY:)"
4,I SAW THIS AS A KID - NEVER FORGOT IT!,"While this isn't the best quality DVD or even the best movie, I still enjoyed it while watching last night. I remember seeing this at a movie theatre when I was a kid and it is one movie I never forgot. Although this felt like a scripted/documentary type made movie, it still made me believe there are creatures out there, such as Bigfoot (or the Fouke Monster in this movie). I'm glad I purchased this DVD because now I can relax as I never thought I would see this, for me, -""unforgettable""- movie again. Make sure you watch it in the dark to get the full effect. Oh, one more thing I did chuckle at the songs in the movie. If you see the movie, you'll know what I mean. Enjoy."
3,THE LEGEND OF BOGGY CREEK,SLOW DOWN AND WATCH THIS ONE LATE IN THE EVENING.IT SEEMS SO REAL. A REAL POSSIBILITY. THE VIDEO QUALITY COULD BE BETTER. A LOT OF THE MOVIE DEPENDS ON YOUR OWN EXPERIENCES AND IMAGINATION.
4,Chilling,"A documentary style movie, based on true stories, sends chills up your spine. The BigFoot/Sasquatch is barely seen (and that's good because of the poor special effects release) but that's enough to scare you. The DVD is not great quality but anyway enjoyable.A good cryptozoology movie."
1,DVD movies,"Not what I thought it was. Nothing wrong with the product, but the film wasn't the best. Kind of funny though, in a gitchy kind of way!"
5,Always loved this film,"Probably one of the first(if not the first) documentary style films. True story about a local bigfoot legend and the people that believe he is really out there. I personally am very interested in bigfoot and have read several books on the subject of sasquatch. This is a cool little movie, even though it is pretty cheesy and the end will have you rolling with laughter.(Because of the cheesiness.. not because it's a comedy, it's not a comedy.. well, not meant to be) I watched this as a kid and always had fond memories. Watching it again was not only nostalgic but very entertaining. I can see why some people wouldn't like it. If you take it to seriously you will be disappointed. It's a cheesy, documentary style movie about a local bigfoot legend.... sit back and enjoy."
4,Interesting,"This was bought for my stepfather for a small christmas present. I didnt think at first that I would like it, but it turned out to be very interesting. oh and this is a documentary, not a movie. I thought at first it was going to be one of those old low budget 70's movies where the costumes are bad and the acting is even worse, but it was surprising a good documentary. If you are interested in things like this then I would recommend buying it."
3,Still gives me the willies,"I first saw this movie in theaters as a child and to this day won't set my sofa in front of a window. While a little corny now compared to other high-tech movies, I still get creeped out by strange sounds from the woods behind my house. If you saw this years ago, its fun watching again."
3,A movie you want to watch over and over,"I watched the Movie Legend of Boggy Creek years ago whenit first came out and liked it then and I like it now.The music is catchie and some of the places looked spooky.I passed through Texarkana years ago and I talked to oneperson at a gas station and he said ""Awa shocks that storywas just a hoax"" but others said differently. You have tomake your own mind up if you think it is a hoax.The movie is old therefore it is not the best quality butI will still watcher it from time to time. I know it by heart.Charley"
5,gripping blood curdling realism gone awry documentary a must,"One of the world""s most famous creatures comes alive in this brilliant documentary on the ""skunk ape"". Sit back and watch as this horrific tale of savagery comes alive. Bone-chilling screams, surreal barbarianism and true horror make this a must see for everyone except the faint of heart."
2,Needs updating,The movie was not what I was expecting. The music was so old and was played in a manner as to prevent fear at the times fear would have normally been felt. It would just have been a better movie presentation if it were updated since the showings of Bigfoot were animated anyway.
3,or 2.5 ratin...past/present action of b.c.,narration of past supposed facts and current dramatizations; has good enough changeable scenerys and actions to the end but vid q of the versions of this film can get pretty dark and blurry.
3,mildly entertaining,"Boggy Creek is so bad it's funny. I don't know if it was supposed to be serious or not, but if it makes you afraid to go into the woods, there's something wrong with you. Nobody should be afraid to go into the woods--especially because of this movie.If you like to make fun of bad movies, you'll like this one. I heard it even made it onto Mystery Science Theater."
1,more laughs than screams,"I read online reviews stating that this was the most frightening movie ever made. But the only reaction from my family was laughing at the poor quality and stereotypical hillbilly portrayals. We almost turned it off when the monster folk music started. This movie is notable as a cult classic, as a Sasquatch quasi-documentary, and possibly as a time capsule depicting rural America in the 1970's, but it has little entertainment value. I was quite disappointed."
2,Massage what?,Very disappointed in this product. The 'power' in the name of this product refers to what?
3,Didn't have what I was looking for...,"I have been looking for a year for the electronic-tinged, vocoder-filled instrumental version of ""Planet Rock"" that used to be played everyday on the radio and have been unsuccessful. I thought I had finally found it when I came across this EP, however it was not there. I gave the recording three stars because I already have all these versions. My rating may not be fair because I was looking for a particular version that is unfortunately not included in this collection, however the song remains danceable and groundbreaking for its time on all the included versions. If you have only one or two versions of this mega-hit, get this EP."
4,suspenseful and fun; perhaps not for Philip K. Dick fans,"Vulcan's Hammer is a very conventional early science fiction story about the future of the world dominated by a computer. Naturally the humans catch on that this situation has drawbacks, and a rebellion is launched. But with Vulcan's Hammer the computer doesn't take kindly to any encroachment on its reign.Unlike the author's later works there aren't any deep-rooted social commentary with Vulcan's Hammer. And this story is completely readable; I believe many Philip K. Dick fans enjoy deciphering his often unintelligible prose. Best of all the story reads as a suspense novel, with the author deftly placing in twists to keep the reader hooked .. and it worked for me.Bottom line: a fun if somewhat unremarkable read. Recommended."
4,What's dat in ur mouth?,This tongue ring is really kewl cuz it reallys gives that effect that u have sum type of tylenol in ur mouth. The only bad thing is I don't like to wear it all the time cuz it gets annoying after a while.
2,There's better on the market,"I do not like the design of these particular brand tire swipes. The reason being is, you may be fine with the curve in the applicator if you have smaller tires. However, if your vehicle has larger tires, these swipes are more of a burden than a helpful resource. It slowed me down considerably as I found they required more pressure to distribute the gel evenly across the surface of the tire. Another drawback to this also means due to the pressure required and ""drag"" across the tire that these ""break down"" much quicker than others i've used. I own my own automotive detailing business and while the concept of the swipe as a product is excellent, I would lean more towards a uniformed surface foam applicator as they save time and have better overall distribution of the tire gel."
1,Save Your Money,"I found this book a waste of time. Looking for actual timber frame plans, instead I found a bunch of pictures in no particular order or organization. May make a makeshift coffee table book for people to read while you think big thoughts in your completed timber frame home, but it sure won't help you design one."
2,A more subdued Teddy,"Hi, love Teddy's vocal range and this is obviously an early collection soon after his accident. He is good but I have heard better renditions by him. So, I rate this okay not extraordinary."
3,Teddy P,"I bought this CD expecting to hear the songs in their original format...Recording is ok....""Turn Off The Lights""_ one of my all time fav."
1,Caveat emptor,"This is a marvelous book. Worth every penny. However, this is a 1998 printing of the original 1968 first edition. This version has no updates and no new editing."
4,Nice collection selection,"It was nice to find the nice selection in this set for my son's ""Cars"" collection. Especially ""Mater"" which at least in this area is practically impossible to find. This set does include the well made metal cars, not the plastic versions which was a concern when I found the set. Nice selection, well made, decent price."
5,Super Connie,"The best by far of books on The Connie, with superb B&W and color photos. Exceptional detail about all production versions and accidents. A handsome, good sized, well made book."
1,"""New Age"" mumbo-jumbo","This book contains so many absurd assertions that it would be funny if not for the fact that a lot of people buy this charlatan's mumbo-jumbo. It's written fairly well, but it's all bulls--t."
3,Marginal at best,"This book has a few error, several typographical errors and some inconsistencies. For a short book it contains repetitions many times, it seems more like a non-to-well edited summary. An example is that bandwidth and frequency deviation (see pg 39 second paragraph and pg 44 box). It contains many watered-down examples which have inaccurate terminology."
4,It's in the go bag in my car,"Decent tool set for emergencies and odd jobs. Not great, not terrible, with the right amount of tools for getting most little jobs or repairs done."
4,Handy and Often Used,"I keep these tools in my work office. We have video/media specialists, legal and administrative types, policy makers, managerial and elected officials in my area. I am constantly amazed at how many times this tool set gets used. The video folks have their own tool kit, but frequently they come and borrow a specific device within this kit. The handy case ensures all are returned and the tools are of adequate capability. Good deal generally."
2,"Nice tools, deceptive description.","This is a decent small set. I bought one a while back for my college-bound daughter.It would be nice if they could be HONEST about what you are getting: SEVEN tools, one cheap fabric case, and ""48-piece fastening set"" = 56 ""tools"". Puh-leeeeese!"
2,Poorly Made,"I didn't expect heavy duty construction, but I did expect the screw bits to be well-made enough to put together Ikea furniture. Sadly, the screwdriver was not even up to this task. These are more like a kid's first tool set than anything else."
2,"I'm not quite sure what their definition of ""hip"" is.","As a younger crochet fanatic (early 20s) I am always on the lookout for patterns that I, or people I know, would actually wear. This book does not have it! Mostly containing hats and scarves it is not a great source for patterns. Cuter items can be found for free on the web. In addition to the lack of ""hip"" ness, almost all the pattern examples are done in browns, tans, and orange colors making them even more unappealing and looking like something from the 70s. Overall the book seems to cry out ""hippie"" more than ""hip"". MANY better books are available out there and I strongly suggest picking out an alternative. I would suggest the ""stitch & bitch"" series for crocheting - Much Better book!!"
2,"Ho Hum, not so Hip","I didn't find the designs in this book to be especially hip or exciting. They did nothing for me and were in fact kind of ""same old, same old""... nothing new here.That said, the book is well laid out and easy to read..."
3,"Not Hip, but Still Nice","I was dying to buy this book since it claims to have ""Hip"" crochet patterns. So I checked it out at my local library, which I try to do with every book before I buy and possibly regret the purchase. I'm beyond glad I checked it out because the patterns are definitely not hip. They could considered contemporary, but not trendy or hip. They remind me of early 90's or a throwback to the 70's styles and the yarn colors used seemed muted. Otherwise the book is still decent, but shouldn't be bought for the title alone."
2,Not the best.,"The most exciting project in this book is the scarf on the cover. Nothing else is hip, most are stodgy and boring. If you really want to see this book, you'd be better off grabbing it at your local library."
3,Hip? Hardly.,"I must say, I don't think these projects are for the beginner. For one thing, they use a lot of 1 size yarn (the thinest yarn out there) for their projects, and that can be very hard to work with.I also think they tried a little too hard to be ""Hip"". They have models that look like they must be over the age of 30, trying to look like they are 15. There are about three or four projects in there I would try (the capelet, the second bucket hat, the zig-zag scarf, and the scarf on the cover, even though I might have a time doing that one, being as to how the yarn is so thin). The others seem a little too trendy, and over-the-top ""hip"", and not what I would wear. (And those lumpy baskets? I don't think so!)I have never done one of their patterns (I did start the hat, but only got to about the fifth or sixth round, and everything seemed okay up to then), so I can't judge on how well-written they are, but, I hope this helps some. :)"
2,a few cute patterns,"I found a few cute patterns, but most of the items in this book, I would not even bother to try. The patterns were difficult to follow."
5,Baby Traps (Buddy Rich),"I have watched many videos, but as a drummer, Buddy Rich was in a class of his own, and personally I have never seen anybody come close to playing style, and virtual tap dancing around the drum set. He might have been a hard core band leader, but you just can't take his god given talent away. As most Buddy Rich Big Band videos and CD's, this one is another great video to watch the master at work, along with some of the hottest musicians of Jazz."
5,The best Buddy Rich DVD yet,"Don't get me wrong, as stated above, the audio is somewhat lacking.But Buddy is in his prime and absolutely on fire here. I've seen most of the BR DVDs and watched a bunch of footage on youtube, but few clips come close to the intensity here. As well, he seems to really push himself and plays licks I haven't seem him play elsewhere. Channel One Suite is extended and they really stretch on it, and Buddy's solo at the end is one of his absolute best. The tempos are all faster than usual, and the band is burning.If you are looking for a Buddy Rich dvd to buy, start here.My only complaint is they have this angle they frequently use that is a closeup of the snare with the ride cymbal blocking our view of his left hard. ARGGH! That's the hand I most I want to see!"
4,Another Musician,"As a general consumer - The DVD quality was great. My 3 kids (2 young percussionists and a tenor player) loved it just as I loved seeing Buddy when I was a child.As a professional, the gaps in the performance are clear. Still this is a good band and classic Buddy Rich drumming."
5,Ya Gotta Have This!,"I turn my 52"" HDTV to composite 1, and then crank up thestereo. Buddy's Killer Force is in my living room and it is just waytoo cool. The snare drum volume is just a tad low until Grand Concourse,and then it is all there in it's full grandeur. The hi-hat and cymbalsare crisp. You can hear the bass drum and toms just fine. I am literallywearing this dvd out. And when I do, I'll get another one thank you verymuch. You can even hear the tones from Buddy's sticks during his rimshots. It's just fantastic!"
3,Perhaps the top of a limited Rich collection,"I somehow missed Buddy Rich when I was growing up. Only in the past 5 or so years have I tuned into what he was and did. Although I have to admit he's still not my favorite paradiddlist, I think it essential for jazz collectors to have some of his material...and if possible a DVD of a live performance.This is it. A great band and a taste of Buddy that should satisfy!"
