4,Shared the Beginnings of SNL With My 8-Yr Old,"Loved the early skits featuring ""Land Shark"",""Tod and Lisa"" ""Weekend Update"" my kid finally got to see what Mom was talking about.She loved the Gilda skits and the ""cheeseburger, cheeseburger"" bits as well as the bare chested Steve Martin's ""King Tut"".I got to catch up on the mid-years of SNL highlights. Celebs abound in the audience.A bit long."
3,Not quite what you might expect,"After seeing most of the Saturday Night Live 25th Anniversary Show, including some of my favorite clips, I thought this would be a great DVD to have. I was somewhat surprised when I received my order that it contained only 1 disk. I wondered how a 4+ hour show could be condensed to one disk, but since it was DVD, anything was possible. The content on the disk is NOT the complete show. Many of the clips shown in their entirety where greatly shortened. While this is a nice remembrance of the 25th anniversary show, don't buy it thinking all of your favorite clips will be there whole."
4,DVD's are great because you can skip the boring parts,"I watched this DVD of the special SNL 25th anniversary 2+ hour show once all the way through. The show can be easily broken down into two varieties: the montages of the funniest skits you remember from the past 25 years and the other boring intro stuff in between. You'll get some chuckles from Tom Hanks' ""impromptu"" questions from the audience (including Christopher Walken) and seeing demi-god David Bowie banter with Jerry Seinfeld, but the gems of the show were the clips from Saturday Night Live and the tributes to the comediens who passed away over the years. Sometimes I put the DVD on and choose the tribute to the first five years chapter, or something that will get me a quick laugh without having to listen to Sarah Michelle Gellar. This DVD is great for someone who likes only what they can imitate from SNL and thinks stars doing half-a** jobs at improvs is funny. Otherwise, I'd recommend something that has more SNL skit content."
3,Sarah only please,Haven't seen this DVD but this review mentioned in a negative way my favorite actress Sarah Michelle Geller & I would love to get a copy of Sarah's appearences on SNL. So what this reviewer wanted to avoid at least clued me to the possibility that I could here get the Sarah footage I wanted that he disliked. Sarah forever!
4,CD Readily available,"This is a great CD and is not ""RARE."" Its publication was funded by the Tennessee Arts Commission and is available from the Arts Center of Cannon County at cost (NOT $50.) It is not an easy listening CD, but a great resource for fans of Uncle Dave Macon."
1,Not The Best Place for an UDM fan to start,"This is not uncle dave's finest work. The story behind this recording it is appealing, but the music DOES NOT live up to Dave's best material. He forgets lyrics in the middle of songs on this set, which is understandable, the editing of conversation in between songs isn't great either. Do yourself a favor and get the Go Long Mule set if you want a good first UDM album to start with. That's got the best stuff, even though there's no keep my skillet good and greasy on it."
1,Poor and garrulous writing style.,"I picked up the book because of the reviews and acclaims on the cover and the interesting beginning to the novel. After the first page however, it turns out to be a very badly written piece of work. I gave up by around page 50. The narrator describes in excess every single, physical, unimportant detail of the setting or of minor characters and engages in poor similes. His style is badly written. Flat characters are introduced briefly which have no bearing on the plot. Don't waste your time on it."
1,DREADFUL,"I don't even want to waste anymore time on this horrible book, just wanted to warn people not to read it. The most boring book I've ever picked up!"
5,Great Finale to this Series,"I need to book a ticket to Seaside. This tiny resort town on the New Jersey shore came alive under the deft storytelling of Gayle Roper. The fourth book in her Seaside Seasons series deals with marital trouble that takes on epic proportions-- a full six-year hiatus. We see Trev and Dori struggling with past hurts and stubborn pride against the backdrop of a full-blown art theft ring in which they get tangled. If you start this book, plan to read it straight through-- it's not an easy one to put down."
1,Incredible...,"The disgusting vibrato of this ensemble destroys the polyphonic and harmonic subtlety of Gesualdos music almost completely.No, as in most renaissance vocal polyphony, vibrato of this kind is NOT a question of personal taste: it is clearly against the nature of this music..."
1,Not Mastering,"The title is misleading. Nobody, after watching this DVD, will come anywhere close to mastering option volatility strategies. I would call it ""an introduction to option volatility"". Sure,it's a decent introduction. But that's not what it's being marketed as. For anyone wanting to master option volatility, this may be a decent introduction, but look elsewhere to master the art."
3,too heavy,"I got this car seat to match my stroller and although i love my stroller the car seat needs work. My baby was a small newborn and never looked comfortable in it. It didn't recline enough for her as a newborn. Also this car seat is extremely heavy. I can only go from the car into the stroller or someplace quick. It is way to heavy to carry around, which is really inconvenient. It does appear safe and it doesn't get real hot and I live in south MS. Overall I like it because I love my stroller!"
2,2006 model is disappointing,"The car seat was redesigned for 2006. the new model looks extremely uncomfortable for infants. It's too upright and has no infant insert. My baby's head AND upper body just flops forward. Not only does this posture look unhealthy and uncomfortable for him but also I can't imagine that position would be safe in an accident. In addition, the seat is so so big and heavy that I envy people with the smaller car seats, whom get to lug their babies around in them. I refuse to detach it from the car, it's just too hard to carry around, and I'm a relatively strong woman. Also, the handle and adjustments are hard to reach and use. I wish that I could return the item! One would think that such an expensive name brand would be a safe bet as a purchase. Guess not!"
2,Not a good buy.,"I purchased the Primo Viaggio Carseat and Pliko 3 stroller. Although I have received many compliments on how this travel system looks, I am really disappointed with the car seat. First of all, it is really HEAVY! With my 4 month old baby being in the 90% percentile, I have given up on even attempting to use it as an infant carrier. The material is also very HOT! I try dressing my baby in the lightest clothes possible, but she starts crying after 10 minutes in the car. When I pick her up, her back is all wet from sweating. Finally, the seat doesn't recline and the pillows on the sides of the head area do not provide adequate support for newborns. I tried using another head support pillow instead, but the ones that come with the car seat do not detach and don't leave enough room for anything else. The only thing you can do is roll up a receiving blanket to prop the baby's head up."
2,Do not even thonk about it!!!!!!!!!!!,"I spent a total of $ 700 between the stroller A3 and the car seat. Unfortunatelly, the car set is not convenient at all. It is way to heavy and does not recline enough for the baby to be comftable. You better off spending $100 and get a Combi ot any other well rated brand"
3,mistake?,"I purchased this set and yet I recieved the LC-15S1U but I thought I purchased the Sharp LC-15E1U (as advertised and sold). What is the difference between these 2 models. Also, enclosed is the packaging I was sent the wrong coaxial cable--this had 2 female ends and I had to buy an adapter. And this is just the first day."
4,Electricial Engineers Portable Handbook,"I have found this book to be very helpful for the electricial industry. There is much information available which can only be found by using many other publicatons or information available only from the manufactor of the equipment. It covers services, and grounding of electricial systems. It also covers fire protection systems, motors and lighting. There are many charts and graphs in the book. I would recommend this book for anyone in the electricial field."
3,"Well, It IS Portable","This is a good collection of useful information in compact form. I like the old tables that are missing in newer editions of the NEC. When odering this book, be sure to get a good magnifying glass. Lots of 3 pt text here."
3,Great reference book,"This is a great book for the design engineer. The book is unlike most on the subject, in that it covers the ""real world"" aspects of using capacitors. The book thoroughly covers the strengths and weaknesses of each type of capacitor as it relates to various applications. Highly recommended."
3,Realistic war scenes; cardboard characters,"The characters in this book are not nearly as fleshed out as you'd expect from good fiction (many of them, in fact, seem flat and interchangeable), but anything to do with a B17 is captivating, and for these scenes this book's a worthwhile read for anyone interested in the details and fine texture of what it was like to have bomber duty in Europe. I found the number of slangy forties expressions annoyingly excessive. It felt like the author had compiled every idiomatic phrase he could think of and substituted them for dialogue containing substance. And several expressions clanged as being closer to the 80's than the 40's. If this aspect of WWII interests you, I strongly suggest that you also read the well-written and thoroughly engaging memoir ""The Fall of Fortresses"" by Elmer Bendiner."
4,easy to install,This valve is easy to install unlike the Moen and Price Pfisters valves. It is heavy and wide so you need extra cpvc or copper pipes to make it fit with existing plumbing.
5,Excellent Bible story for even young preschoolers,"Of all the books in this series this is perhaps the very best for very young children, mine getting interesting in it between 10 months and year old - just watch them as you read - these are paper pages that tear easily when little fingers grab!The illustration are cute and easy for children to relate to. The story lines simple and the message sweet and reassuring."
1,Nope,"Don't even waste your time. The sound was so quiet, it was unbelievable. And if you boost up the sound, nothing but noise. It looks great, I tried to unscrew it to see if something was going on, it just basically fell a part. Lesson to all reviews, tell the truth because if you purchase something and need a true assessment of the product, what comes around goes around.I'm taking the loss on this. I don't want to go through the entire hassle of returning it, all the mumbo jumbo required to get my money back, I just lost."
2,"Overrated, in my opinion","Joyce Carol Oates is certainly prolific. But a book this long should not have the same sentence structure on every single page. The prologue is promising, but the rest of the book maintains exactly the same style of questions, incomplete sentences, and sentences beginning in prepositions. I got so bored with the repetition that I couldn't get past the first chapter. The style is pretentious and overly simplistic at the same time. Maybe if you like Oates you'll like this book; if you're not sure, I'd advise at least reading a bit of it before you buy it. Then, if you can imagine enjoying that style of prose for 531 pages, more power to you."
4,"short on illustration, long on content","One of the Dover Children's Thrift Classics, this book has only six black & white illustrations, but contains more of the Arabian Nights stories than most books with glossy pictures. In these 83 pages of text you'll find six stories: Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp, Abou Hassan or the Sleeper Awakened, Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, The Enchanted Horse, Camaralzaman and Hadoura, and The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor.With large clear type, this is a good selection for a pre-teen interested in fantastic tales and mythology."
4,Wonderful Classic Tales,"Originally Arabic, these classic Tales are Adventurous and Enchanting. All Magic and monsters, Alladdin is my all time favourite and all kids love to listen too. The Magic Lamp is amazing and if we all had it, the Genie would be oh so kind to favour us to fulfil our wish to spread peace on Earth! Alibaba and the Forty Thieves is an adventure tale and the cave spell that in the end,Ali Baba becomes rich! Sinbad the Sailor takes on a voyage to sea and these beautiful stories simply makes you soar your kids imagination and love to explore the dreamy world of wonderful classic tales. A must for a Children's Library and sure pick, any time, anywhere - Only I guess I'd liked the hard bound edition of Classic Adventures of Fabbri Publishing Ltd., spain. For kids, Paper back editions are good and can pass by for reads. Anyways, this is a good Pick!"
3,Only 90 cents?,"Here's a nice price for something who looks like a nice book (because I have read Aladdin and other Arbian Nights stories, and I liked them). Too bad only that the shipping price for it is 4 dollars, which make me re-think my decision to buy it! :-/"
2,Definitely not worth the money!!!,"We bought this toy for my 2 1/2 year old son. We have other take along sets that are alot of fun, but this oneis lousy. The top curved track keeps falling off, the carnival sign keeps popping off, and the fun house archdoesn't stand up. My son played with it for a few days, but I have to keep putting the track back togetherand that makes him lose interest in the toy. I wish I read the reviews for this before I bought it, because I wouldnever have spent the money on this. I'm going to disassemble it and keep the track, but this toy is a BIGdisappointment."
3,"Great toy, but falls apart easily...","My son got this for his third birthday - he absolutely loves it! For the most part it's a great toy, except for the top part of the long inclined part of the track - that piece is constantly falling off if the track is bumped even a little bit. For the most part my son is very careful with it, because he enjoys playing with the track so much, but he does get frustrated because the joints are a little fiddly and require a grown-up's coordination to put back together.We're going to try using hot glue on the underside of the track join for that piece, to see if it gives it just enough sticking power to stay together.Also, it stays together MUCH better on hard floors as opposed to carpet.I still haven't exactly figured out how this track is supposed to be ""take along"" - maybe you could carry the spiral somewhere with you, but the rest of the track is too bulky to bother taking anywhere.Regardless, my son LOVES this toy and plays with it every day."
2,Great - if you own stock in superglue!!,"I too did not read the reviews before I bought it, and we can't even get it put together, much less get it to STAY together!! I'm seriously close to breaking out the soldering iron!! My son loves the trains and the tracks, but they barely stay together on the floor, much less suspended by flimsy plastic. Great toy for hardwood floors, very careful kids, and a lot of superglue. Other than that...you might wanna skip this one and get some of the other Thomas train sets that are a little more durable."
3,OK if you don't use it on carpet,"My son got this toy for his 2nd birthday and just loves it. Like other people have said, the thing does fall apart easily. But, if you set it up on hard surfaces (we have ours in the kitchen) and not on the carpet, it does MUCH better. My son plays with his for hours at a time with the track only coming apart once or twice. That is still more than ideal, but he loves this toy so much and on the carpet it fell apart pretty much every time he put a train on it."
1,Be prepared to invest time & money Crazy Gluing the track together,My son got this toy for Christmas. This toy was a nightmare to assemble and has been an enormous pain in the neck to keep from falling apart. The downhill and corkscrew portions of the track fall apart with just you breathing on it. We've spent more time putting the pieces back together than my son has playing with it.
2,Breaks apart too easily,"My 2.5 yr old loves this toy. Unfortunately, I absolutely hate it since it requires me to rebuild it every few minutes. Nothing stays connected and it's all held together so precariously, if you so much as sneeze on it, it falls apart. The worst part is the domino effect, one part of the track falls apart and then the rest follow and so instead of a simple connection fix, it turns into a complete rebuild of the incline. My tot doesn't play with it roughly and just rolls his trains on it and it still falls apart. It's more frustrating than fun. Don't bother buying it."
1,falls apart everytime!!,"my 4 yr old loves toy roller coaters and loves thomas what a graet combo well, he was so excited to receive this as a present but his excitment didnt last long he couldnt really play with it the trains fall off ,the track comes apart and falls down everytime he goes around the track just once. i would not recommed it is alot of money for a toy that is junk i expected alot more so did my son!"
2,Not durable,"My daughter and I saw this and just knew that her son and my grandson, who is almost 4, would LOVE it. He adores Thomas and trains. First of all, the gray track that goes from top to bottom will come apart even if Ethan is using the yellow swirly side. Also, what is the short level gray track at the base at the bottom of the swirly side that leads to the gray circle in the middle - we can't figure out what it's for and there appears to be a very short track next to that. Maybe it's there so someone can purchase extra track. If that's the case it would improve this and maybe the set we purchased has that section of track is weak or defective. Lastly, as far as this review we were both slightly confused as to the rating of this toy's educational value."
2,Would be great if it would stay together!,"This track is fun, but I get tired of putting it together over and over and over again. It won't stay together. Very frustrating."
2,Great concept / falls apart all the time,"I like the metal Thomas trains, I bought lots of them. The idea of this slide is brilliant. BUT: the implementation is really, really poor: very, very cheap plastic makes this toy fall apart after the slightest touch. Buy a set of tracks instead and put them on a tilting piece of cardboard to make your own slide..."
4,Another use for duct tape!,"The multitude of unfavorable reviews for this toy are not completely unfounded; however, the spiral slide is way up there on the cool factor in our 3-yr old boy's eyes. I agree that hardwood surfaces are best for this. We put some duct tape on the ""underside"" of the track pieces so that they stay together. We added a ""splint"" to the underside of the incline section. It holds for a week or so around our little El Destructor with dimples.While it isn't perfect, I'd still buy it again."
2,Not much for the price,"Fortunately this was a gift for my son. I didn't realize it costs this much! For how little there is with this, it seems people are being taken for a ride!"
1,Terrible Horrible No Good Rip Off,"As you can see from the title, I am a little bit peeved that this item is a piece of junk. It was a pain to put together, which I do not even figure into my rating. The worst part is that it falls apart constantly. You barely touch it and it falls apart! The cardboard background falls apart! We are returning the item in hopes of finding something that is not a total gimmick. Great looking on the box but beware, it is a total joke. The company who manufactured this item knew good and well it was a hunk of junk when they shipped it out to stores. It is such a shame."
1,COMPLETE JUNK - SHOULDN'T BE IN STORES,"Overpriced and falls apart constantly. Would give it 0 stars if I could. ""Take-along"" description is just a cop-out for how flimsy this junk is. By the time a kid could match the tiny part-numbers to the instructions and enjoy putting it together (since all pieces look the same), he/she'd be too old for the toy. Younger kids cry when it collapses as they think they've broken it. Very space consuming too. Wish I'd read the reviews before ""santa"" brought something we can't really have him ""take back""."
2,Not made to play with!,"This would be a great toy if your child never played with it. Even putting it together made me want to scream. The tracks fall apart with the littlest nudge. They have clamps that are suppose to make them stay together, but those fall off all the time. You really have to have a parent around all the time while your child is playing because it constantly comes apart. It just is not made very well at all."
1,Parent of a 3-1/2 year-old,"The Thomas and Percy Carnival Adventure toy is a waste of money. It falls apart at the slightest jostle from our 3-1/2 year-old boy, upsetting him and frustrating us, because we have to keep putting it back together. It is unsteady at best, rickety at worst. It's obvious the toy manufacturers don't test these things out on children (if they test them at all). They just don't hold up under real-world use."
1,Worst toy ever!!!,"Don't buy this toy! Very poorly made, doesn't stay together, nothing stay together and you spend most of your time putting it back in place. I don't understand how they can make such a delicate toy for toddler, it's ridiculous. That toy needs to be out of the market."
3,Great,The author came to our area for a recap on this book and reference for his series. There are many followers for personal reflection and reference.
5,Great! So much info and easy to read,"I thoroughly enjoy reading this book, as it gives me a collection of information from the doctors of the church, yet is easy to understand. There is so much in it that we can apply to our lives. I can read it over and over, taking away something each time."
5,Fulfillment of All Desire,"This book is one that keeps my attention and makes me want to get back to it as soon as possible each time I have to put it down. That is not what I expected from a scholarly work on the spiritual life, based on seven Doctors of the Church. I'm very happy that I purchased this book."
5,You don't have to be Catholic to benefit from this!,"Ralph Martin took 10 years to write this book and it was intended to help him in his Christian walk. The effort has certainly paid off! I am currently on the chapter concerning prayer which is full of insight, wisdom and with practical steps to increase one's prayer life in effectiveness and depth. This is not to say that the preceeding chapters were not helpful; they have their contribution and corroborated much of what I have come to understand about the Christian walk, however each reader will find his or her own particular section which speaks to a special need or supplies insight. This is an owner's manual in operational Christianity which will be of great value in anyone's library."
2,Not What I Expected,"If you are into gang raping in a sense, then this book is for you. I did not read anymore of the book when she was taken advantage of by 3 men. The author has made this book not appealing."
3,Just okay.,"Most of the stories were good, but it was hard to get too involved in any of them because of the length. There were 16 stories so none of them ended up being very long. Overall, the book was good, but I just didn't think it was worth the price."
4,Hi-Five's greatest hits are truly great,"This CD has all of the hits and meant to be hits from the popular group. ""I Like The Way (The Kissing Game)"" and ""She's Playing Hard To Get"" are among my favorites and the songs that made them stars. Although the CD is a nice complitiation the new songs don't click with their original material and I think it was a bit too early for a greatest hits although it is a nice collection."
2,Average but Catchy,"Hi-Five had some jams such as I Like The Way,She's Playing Hard To Get,&I Just Can't Handly it.alot of that was Attribute to New Jack Swing King Teddy Riley.who Wrote&Produced those Jams.Hi-Five was a Average Group at best but had some Jams.But N-Sync,Backstreet Boys,98 Degrees,and those other Jokes Should Listen to How doing Real New Jack.cuz on just the above Mentioned Songs Alone these Wack Boy Bands Have Nothing to Match but their Shade."
4,MY SISTER LOVES THIS ALBUM.,"MY SISTER ALWAYS PLAYS THIS ALBUM, SHE LOVES THE SONG ""SHE SAID"" SHE SINGS IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER. THE ALBUM IS REALLY GOOD, ME AND MY SISTER VIBES TO IT AL THE TIME. WE EXPECIALLY LOVE THE SONG ICAN'T WAIT ANOTHER MINUTE"", QUALITY TIME(R-KELLY DID A GREAT JOB)(SMILE), UNCONDITIONAL LOVE,BIRTHDAY GIRL,WHAT YA DOING TONIGHT, AND EXPECIALLY "" SHE SAID"". RECENTLY THE FOUNDING MEMBER TONY THOMPSON DIED, WE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. SO THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE THIS ALBUM GO AND GET IT. IT REMINDS YOU OF THE EARLY 90'2 REALLY YOUTHFUL AND PLAYFUL"
5,Hi-Five memories.....,"Man, you put his album on one day while you clean the house and all these memories start coming to you. That first crush, the first kiss, everything so sweet about being a young teen. Hi-five was the essence of that time. I was about twelve when the kissing game premiered. My sister and brother and I recorded the videos, danced to the songs and went delirious when the sprite commercial premiered. I will admit that they are not quite Boyz2Men; but backstreet boyz and their clones can't hold a candle. This is music! I had to buy the greatest hits twice because the disc keeps getting stolen, with hits like, ""unconditional love"" and ""never should've let you go"", I can understand why. Buy this cd.... you won't be disappointed."
2,Newborn is a world of piano alright. A world unto himself.,"Newborn, like Oscar Peterson, cannot leave well enough alone. They must pound you with their brilliance and technical skills, past the point of tolerance. No doubt, Newborn has chops. But he doesn't play the music. He plays himself. It gets old quickly."
5,exceptional service,"Old school customer service. Cross ref. to Seiko SR621SW specs. an Energizer 364. Order same. Wrong size. Hershel most graciously exchanges for the correct size (317) no extra cost incl. postage. Thank you Hershel.Peace, LS"
5,"To Swing, indeed!",The playing here is bright and upbeat if a little muted by the production. Kessel's work is impeccable on both the ballads and uptempo numbers displaying all aspects of his inimitable sound. The economy of the arrangements here are emphasized by the production as the horn section take a back seat and Barney is front and center. If you enjoy that cool west coast style of the 50's this one's for you.
3,Could be better.,"This works well as a stopper for my tub, but it's turned black, with mold, I guess. I tried spraying it with Tilex which removes mold in the tub area well, but it didn't work on the stopper. Works, but looks dirty and ugly."
4,Lots of Air,"This Air King fan is well made and sturdy. It moves alot of air and is really made for large rooms, I should have purchased a smaller version. Really succeeds in cooling down a room. The only drawback is that it is noisey even on low speed, otherwise I would have given 5 stars."
3,Excessive Vibration,"First let me say that this is a heavy, industrial-quality looking fan. When I took it out of the box I was looking forward to solid performance from this fan. As far as moving air goes, this fan does exceptionally well. Even on low speed, it pushes a LOT of air! But when it does, mine vibrated a great deal and transmitted that vibration to my floors (I'm on a crawlspace, and even though the floor structure is sturdy, the vibrations were very prominent). I'm worried about the long-term effect on the motor bearings, so back it goes. My wife found an el cheapo fan at WalMart that will do until I find a high quality floor fan to replace it."
5,Awesome fan!,This fan is very well built and may be considered a little noisy by some even when set on low but it does move a lot of air.
4,Well Made But Too Loud,"This fan is very well made and is comparable to my 25 year old Patton fan. It moves plenty of air. However, it is much louder than the Patton even on the slowest setting. In my opinion, this fan would be better if the velocity were reduced. I would send the 18 inch model back, except that the restocking charges and shipping are too high. The 20 inch Air King, although still somewhat loud in comparison to the Patton, is considerably quieter than the 18 inch model. I would definitely recommend getting the 20 inch model over the 18 inch."
2,Bad stock,"I recently purchased this item from Amazon and had to return it the following day. I was a bit disappointed by the quality of the fan. First thing I noticed when I opened the box was the rust on the front grill of the fan. I didn't bother taking the fan out of the box. Amazon was willing to have it returned free of charge with no questions asked, hence the 2 stars.One thing I noticed on the box was an old tracking sticker. I have a pretty strong gut feel that this item was recently returned to amazon and was sent to me afterward.For those planning to get this product, try ordering from another seller, probably Kentec."
1,"Defective Out of the Box, Fan Blades Not Attached!","I ordered this fan because I wanted a quality high-velocity fan. I was tired of the Chinese-made junk that is sold at local stores. The fan arrived today. It was packed with material such as used brown-paper grocery sacks and used black plastic garbage bags--as if someone had packed it up in a garage somewhere. I took it out of the box and was astonished to find that the fan blades were not attached to the motor shaft. LOL. So much for American quality! The seller, Kentec offered to send a replacement by UPS Second-day air at their expense. They also sent me a UPS authorized return label, so I did not have to pay for return shipping. So Kentec has good customer service. The replacement fan works just fine. But my opinion would be that Air King has some quality control problems."
5,Air King is a powerhouse!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I had no idea the huge amount of air that the Air King 9118 floor fanAir King 18-Inch 3,190 CFM 3-Speed Pivoting Floor Fan #9218can move. On it's lowest setting it is like sticking your head out of a car window as the car travels at 35 mph. This is not a product for home or office unless you nail down light objects as paper and plastic bags etc. I use the lowest setting possible and still get tropical force winds. Because it is moving so much air it sounds like a small plane taking off. Using the two next highest settings creates a high noise level that is unbearable in a house or small office. For industrial use only!! Try 1300 cfm for a home.Dick"
5,Great Floor Fan !!,"Having own a Patton High Velocity floor fan for a number of years, I thought it was a high quality fan. The Air King 9218 is superior in every way. American made quality with a sealed ball bearing QUIET motor. A rock solid 22 1/2 pounds of durability. It was twice as quiet as the Patton. Philip head removal screws to access the blades if you ever want to clean the dust out from the inside. It has durable looking black finish. The three way switch is much more heavy duty than the Patton. The Air King 9218 moves three cubic feet of air per second. The 9220 with 20"" blades (four and half cubic per second) is only a little bit more but it way too big for my family room. Buy this fan. Keep American jobs and you will be very satisfied with the Air King's quality workmanship. It might cost a little bit more than the usual throw away fans that I have purchased so many times before, but can tell this unit it is going to last. Great value."
5,From Padriac Colum's cousin,"Hi, my great grandmother was Bridgit Colum, and Padriac Colum is my cousin from county Longford, in Ireland. I haven't read Padriac's book yet...but I am sure that it will be an exciting tale to read. The Ireland they knew was surrounded by family...and sometimes joy and also sorrow. I can only imagine the colorful characters that Padriac Colum has invented in his stories.....they will truly be a great legacy to uphold on the richness of Ireland's culture and folklore. I am going to read all of the books written by my cousin and hope that you too will enjoy them!"
1,Skip this strip,"I am an avid flipbook collector but this tedious book was added to my trash can - not my collection. If nudes is what you are after, stick to the work of Eadweard Muybridge."
3,A fascinating story,I am planning on walking this pilgrimage later in the year.The book has proved valuable about the history of the pilgrimage and its remarkable story of Buddhism in Japan.I plan to read it again just before I do the walk.A great read if you want to known more about Buddhism in Japan.
5,Nice and Raw,Link is the king of guitar in the real and natural way. This proves he is primeval and raw like the way true rock instrumentals should be...Swan daze was the real craze with this cat. Excellent tunes and great seller. a++++
1,Buyer Beware,"I got this book (along with the DVD) as a gift since I am a first time mom. I didn't even get past the first chapter of the book and I wanted to throw it out the window. Her advice to put a newborn baby on a strict schedule is cruel and unusual...for sleep, feedings, etc. I understand the need for babies to sometimes ""cry it out"", but at least wait until the baby is older! Babies wants are their needs! Needless to say, I will not even waste my time watching the DVD."
1,Horrible Advice!,"I have the 2001 version and the advice goes against common recommendation from the AAP, such as:1.) Putting baby on back vs stomach. This book says to put on stomach.2.) Says no one (not even children) need milk after 7 months of age. Crazy!3.) Says to start feeding solids at 3 months. Obesity anyone?4.) Not to feed your NEWBORN baby between 10 pm - 6 am. Most newborns need to be fed every 2-3 hours...period.Those are just a few of the ""gems"" that I found in this book. Please, pleaes, don't do what this book says. It is not good for your children."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"I have spoken to an RN Nurse Instructor about this book when it arrived in my library and she was very concerned about the incorrect advice and information in this book. Dr. Denmark constantly advises to give aspirin. It is not recommended to give aspirin in the other medical literature for viral illnesses in children. Dr. Denmark also says to give an enema for a stomach ache and this is dangerous. This book also has a comment about how a parent has learned to diagnose and treat her own children, but diagnosing should always be left up to a medical doctor after examining the child. In doubt with any illness in children, ALWAYS seek the safest actions to take to correct any problems. Your child's life or wellbeing is not worth the risk of a bad decision based on this book's advice."
1,Worst and most dangerous childcare book I've ever read!,"This book is outrageous! It's full of dangerous recommendations such as putting babies to sleep on their stomachs, administering aspirin despite it's association with Reye's Syndrome, treating stomach upset or fever with enemas, and giving meat to 3 month old infants. The schedule she suggests for newborns is cruel - putting the baby down at 10 pm and letting it cry until 6 am. She notes that constant itching from a urinary tract infection can lead to masturbation. Do not buy this book - it's appalling!"
1,Scary that people buy this.,"To get to the point, this ""doctor"" is out of her mind. Most of the things she says to do in this book are dangerous for children and should not be followed by anyone. I'm a teacher and these things scare me. Should any of my parents come and ask me about my opinions on this, I will say that she is old and out of her mind. I'm sorry, but please do not buy this book!!!"
5,"Happy Birthday, Dr. Denmark!","Today, Dr. Denmark turns 108! I have never met her, but I can certainly tell you that because of her, my life at home with my 3 1/2 month old is such a joy!This book is the BEST book I read before my baby boy was born. Madia Bowman (the author) has had 11 childen. She knows what she's talking about. I did exactly what the book said as soon as my son was born and have never looked back. Every single piece of instruction in this book is right on. My son is happy, healthy and thriving! He is content and wonderful. He slept through the night (7 hours) when he was 5 days old. At 3 months old, he went to 12 hours. He now eats 3 meals a day (nursing first, then feeding). We are thrilled!Please buy this book and believe that Dr. Denmark knows what she's talking about. Her teachings are not about selfishness from the mother's standpoint--it's about HEALTH for the baby!Please, I implore you...buy this book and do what it says!Thank the Lord for Dr. Denmark and Madia Bowman!"
5,One of the best feamale Debut albums I've ever heard,"This is a really great album. It sounds really cool like early nineties, summertime, you know that kind of sound. And it has some of my all time favorite Aaliyah songs like, Back and forth, At your best, Down, young nation, age aint nothin but a number, no one knows, and my absolute favorite Aaliyah song street thing."
4,An amazing debut,"This album was one of her best. I loved the beat to every song.1. intro2. Throw your hands up- this is a good song I love the beat even though the chorus is kinda annoying.3. Back and forth- this song is pretty good, pretty much the same as throw yur hands up accept the chorus is better.4.Age ain't nothing but a number- this is a slow song, it's ok.5.Down with the clique- this is kinda a wierd song6. At your best- this song song is ok7. know one knows how to love me quite like you do- ok song8. I'm so into you- ok song9. street thing- pretty good song10. young nation- ok song11. old school- weird12. I'm down ok13. back and forth (remix)- goodtop songsback and forthback and forth remixthrow your hands up"
5,The first is a classic,I have had this since it first came out and have always loved it. she is the best and will be the best.
5,The way life goes...,"Sad and weird it is, but the fact is that I hadn't bothered listening to Aaliyah before. All I knew was that she had starred in ""Romeo Must Die"" alongside Jet Li.Now, I found out this morning she had been killed in a plane crash yesterday, in the Bahamas. So I figured: let me see who this girl really was!And I saw myself listening to her music, to be gladly surprised that she's not the common type of R&B act at all: she died at 22, so that makes this 1994 album a remarkable feature, having recorded it age 14! If you listen to the sample tracks above, you'll be as amazed as I continue to be...I know her music will live in the hearts of all her fans, and will continue to gain the respect she well deserved. The biggest irony of all is that barely a month ago, her new album had hit the stores, one which the majority of the public reviewers here in Amazon have termed 'more mature' and 'eclectic'.R.I.P. Aaliyah"
2,Not her best...,"First of all, I love Aaliyah. But on this album, she relied way too much on R.kelly to do all the work for her. The beats are all R.Kelly and no Aaliyah. And on this album, her vocals are only so-so. And there is too much hard hip-hop and not enough Rnb. This Cd could just have easily been called ""Age ain't nothing but a number; R.Kelly with Aaliyah on vocals."" But after R.kelly left her, she went uphill."
3,"IT'S ""ALRIGHT""","AALIYAH CAN'T REALY SING, BUT SOME OF THE SONGS ARE INTERESTING. MY FAVORITES ARE TRACKS 1-7. BESIDES THOSE THE ALBUM SUCKS."
4,Impressive Debut,"When Aaliyah released this, she was only 15 years old. And despite how young she was, this album is quite good. The best songs from the album were some of the singles released which were Back And Forth (Went to #1) and At Your Best which is just a beautiful song. Aaliyah is singing from her heart and I just can't stop listening to the song. Sure it's no ""One In A Million"" or ""Aaliyah"" but it's still a good album. Aaliyah's music will be missed and her music will live on for years to come."
5,People need to encourage more often!,I feel that Aaliyah is very talented and I love and own every Cd that she has and is singing on. So keep up the good work girl!
5,it rocks and i love it!!!!,i bought it for my cousin and been trying to find it everywhere and they did't have them but you did thans a bunch!!!!
4,stands the test of time better than I expected,"This cd is one of those throwbacks to the 90's that has really held true. Yes it sounds like what it is, a dated R&B/rap album created by a very talented young woman (R.I.P. Aaliyah). But it sounds so much better than similar albums of its type and era, which makes me wonder what more would have come from this woman! Some tracks are cringe-worthy but they will ALL make you nod your head once again."
2,Fair,"Other CD - Aaliyah is so much better. But she's awesome, anyways. Wish she was here with us today."
3,R. Kelly featuring Aaliyah,"On Aaliyah's debut, it ain't hard to tell that R. Kelly found her. Most of the songs sound like Aaliyah is featured on them instead of them being her own songs like ""Back and Forth"" and ""Old School"" (R. Kelly's name is even being mentioned in the latter's chorus). One of the only moments that you can feel Aaliyah's ability is on the remake of The Isley Brothers' ""At Your Best"". This album is still good to play in your stereo, but if you want a really good Aaliyah album, check out One in a Million (yeah, I know she has another album after that; I meant what I said)."
4,She's got her style.,"Even though her voice isn't that strong like Monica, I like her vocal style. Actually, this album is like R. Kelly's, but I would say this is a must if you really like R&B."
2,average,"Aaliyah is not much of a singer but she has a style about her in her delievery that makes her credible.i really liked Back&fourth.R.Kelly dominates all thru this disc.she has a certain it about her that Brandy,Monica,Myia,etcc.. don't."
3,3 gems,"This album has 3 gems that should be listened to. 1st gem ""Age Ain't Nothing But A Number,"" it's a smooth, breezy song that lets you float to another world. 2nd gem ""At Your Best (Let Me Know),"" excellent remake of the Isley Brothers' soul classic. Aaliyah sings angelically on this song. 3rd gem ""Back And Forth,"" Aaliyah smoothly delivers a powerful bounce track. Overall, ""Age Ain't Nothing But A Number"" is a smooth sounding album with the R. Kelly sound of the time emblazoned all over it. It's a good smooth R&B record. I would recommend it if you are a fan or if you like to listen to smooth R&B. The rest of the tracks aren't as memorable as the three aforementioned gems."
2,Very Ordinary,"Hyped as being tip-top hardboiled noir, but I found it nothing special. Ex-Marine comes back to Southern hometown to find old flame married to a swindler. Everybody's greedy, sleeping with each other, and so on. You can guess where it heads from there..."
3,easy to come apart,These balls are lightening fast.!! But I bought them for my 2 year old to hit with his racket and he tears the foam off the balls with his hands. Maybe good for an adult but The balls are not durable.
3,Nothing new here,"Lots of people trying far too hard to read hidden messages and complex ideas into what is essencially simple, though wonderfully beautiful music. Do yourself a favour and turn up the volume on your CD collection. You won't learn anything from this apart from the crap that self opinionated prats sounding far too pompous for their own good like to make themselves believe is in any way interesting or factual."
5,Appreciation for Myrna Stahman's work,"Myrna Stahman did a wonderful job with her research and planning for working a Faroese-Shaped Shawl from the neck down. Her information was detailed, informative, and creative. Her many hours of work have made my job so much easier! It does take some concentration to pursue these patterns. The end results are worth the challenge. Myrna Stahman has taken much of the frustration out of Faroese shawls. Her work allows you to pursue your own pattern designs with style and confident results."
5,Great Knitting,"The book had clear instructions. Great explanation of a Faroese-shaped shawls and Seamen's Scarves are all about. Instructions are easy to follow. The illustrations are well done. The charts are easy to follow. I would not recommend the shawl patterns for a new knitter. However, I think that the scarves could be mastered by a new knitter."
3,UNINTENTIONAL HUMOR? MANIAC IS A RIOT!,"This film reminded me of those early propaganda warning films Reefer Madness, Cocaine fiends and Sex Addicts. Basically a horror/monster on the loose film, but with on screen cards explaining various mental diseases and a storyline about some crazy experiments. It's just so absurd and filled with hilarity that I was doubled over with laughter as I watched a cat get its eye popped out(not really of course) and surprised at a few b a r e-b r e a s t shots. Please don't get the wrong idea, this film is terrible, but if you like cheap and silly horror films, this should give you a good laugh. My 3 stars rating is for the mediocre print used on the 50 pack horror collection this was a part of(from what I've read, this single disc version isn't any better). It's watch-able, but this kooky film deserves a better looking release."
3,Maniac,"Maniac seems to be a type of propaganda film detailing the dangers of mental disorders. I don't think that this film was made strictly as a propaganda film, but I believe that some extremely sheltered people probably took it seriously. The several scenes of nudity surely shocked the church-going religious freaks of the 1930's, who in turn probably urged their children to stay away from crazy people. It is possible that the film was made as an exploitation endeavor, as it had nudity (though non-sexual) and violence, which was extremely risky and nearly unseen in those days."
3,classic horror/exploitation,"Fans of B-horror should undoubtably be familiar with Dwain Esper's classic romp, but most still aren't. The acting is atrocious, the plot nonexistent, but the images are sure to be implanted in your mind for years to come. This is in ways the birth of the slasher genre, although there would be little continuation of the genre until the post-Hitchcock era of film, and trust me when I say that Ed Wood would have been proud.This disc has no extras, and the version I have doesn't even have a menu option at all. Be warned that there is some sexual misconduct including rape and violence included, so this isn't one of those classics suitable for childrens' eyes."
3,Absolutely insane!,"On the front cover of this DVD it says ""THE MOST BIZZARE FILM EVER MADE"" and you can believe it!! Small wonder it's called ""Maniac""! Perhaps the title describes Dwain Esper himself (the man responsible for this foray into insanity!) Everything about this movie is totaly mad. Murder, dead bodies, and cat fights abound. (Crazy, man, crazy!!) The picture and sound quality are both pretty poor, and sometimes it was difficult to understand exactly what was going on. But, quite interesting nonetheless in a depraved sort of way. If your in the market for a really screwy film, this one could be just what you're looking for!!"
2,"""And Therein Lies its Limitations""","Maybe 2 1/2 Stars. Unfortunately, this film tries to integrate a number of disparate modalities, and this dimishes the import and impact of the message. At times a comedy, at times a tragedy at times a musical! It attempts to be all things to all viewers and therein lies its limitations."
4,Great Movie,This movie mirrors real life and then hands it over to the audience for resolution. You will be pleased with this picture.
1,Garbage,What a waste of time and money. I really like Nadine's work in the past. That is the only reason behind watching this movie. I guess she was off on this one. Unrealistic story line that is hard to follow. Some of the dialogs were brilliant though. I sincerely hope that her next movie is better than this one.
1,Where Do We Go Now?,"I had seen previews of this movie that peeked my interest so was please to see this movie on Prime. Disappointing! No real substance. I think it was supposed to be funny; if so, I was unimpressed by the humor. I did not finish watching this movie. Had it been in a theater, I likely would have walked out as well. Ho Hum!"
1,Did not know,"When I rented this movie, it did not indicate it was subtitled. I'm glad to see it now reads that. I didn't watch it."
1,Amazon tricked me into purchasing this. NO STARS!,"I am really upset that ONCE AGAIN I purchased a movie from Amazon which was subtitled. I am now afraid to purchase movies from Amazon because even though the trailer will be in English, the actual movie is subtitled. Nothing, I mean nothing, in the description indicates this. I DO NOT WANT TO WATCH, OR PAY FOR, SUBTITLED MOVIES!"
1,not what i ordered,i'm quite disappointed. i ordered this book for the great cross-stitch illustrations (at least on the cover). what i received has NO cross-stitch illustrations and has a completely different cover.
1,Do NOT Buy This Book,"Absolutely do NOT buy this book. Daniel Harty's page analysis is not quite accurate. There are approx. 110 physical page sides, of which the first 6 are title, ISBN, contents, etc., followed by a mix of 36 blank log pages + 40 content pages, and the last 28 pages are entirely BLANK for ""Notes""! Have you ever seen so many blank pages at the end of any other book? Even for complete beginners, the 40 content pages are next to useless, mainly promoting the authors' own website for online promotion, where they solicit ""Donations"".Authors, you should be ashamed of yourselves. You disingenuously say ""Terry and I actually wrote this little book for ourselves."" So why publish and charge for it?"
5,What I was looking for,My office desk lamp went out and I needed a fluorescent bulb replacement. I received in two days and was happy with the delivery service and the correct bulb I needed.
3,Children at Birth,"Bradley Teachers Training Required Book. This book was a wonderful addition to my Pregnancy & Natural Childbirth Library. It is very informative and contains real labor and birth photographs along with detailed, personal perspective stories. A good resource for anyone who would like to know more about the Family Aspect of Natural Childbirthing."
2,Question,I'm wondering if there is a way to get this in print? I can't haul out my laptop every time I want to work on one of these projects.
2,Incomplete DVD,"I bought this DVD after watching it several times on Xfinity on demand. This video, unlike the one shown on ON DEMAND cuts before the dance section is done and does not include the cool down which I find very dangerous. I am returning it."
5,Olympus 40-150 lens,"I had purchased the Olympus E-520 w/14-42 lens and also purchased the 40-150 lens at the same time. I'm glad I did. The lens performs very well and provides the necessary photographic requirements I find necessary. No flaws, well constructed and Olympus provides the lens hood with both these lens. Overall I am extremely happy with both Olympus and Amazon. I got the service/price from Amazon and the quality/veritility I was looking for from Olympus."
4,"Good telephoto zoom, very good price","I bought my Olympus E-510 with the 14-42 lens. I wanted a longer lens to give me more reach when shooting distant shots of wildlife. I take this camera hiking, so I wanted a lens that was fairly light. This 40-150 lens was just the ticket. In stores in my area, I would have paid at least twice what I paid through Amazon, so the price was very good. Delivery took awhile because of the Christmas rush. I ordered it before Christmas and got it a little after New Year's, with normal delivery. I have not had time to extensively test it, but I found the lens was lightweight for its focal length, focused resonably quickly, and took sharp pictures at full telephoto. I was pleased that the lens was the same diameter as my 14-42 zoom, so I could use the same filters. So far, so good."
5,thanks.,"great product, arrived on time and in great shape. looking for future business. keep up the great products on here."
4,Olympus User,"I recently was given an Olympus E500 Digital camera; it needed a battery, cable, etc. I searched Amazon and found exactly what I wanted. I was so pleased I purchased a digital 40-150 lens.Excellent experience."
5,Good Lens!,"Its a very good lens. Works great and very easy to use. The only thing I dont like about it is how far away you need to be to get a full body picture... Though I suppose thats my fault for not getting a 35mm instead of 40mm. Oh well, its very good!"
4,"Good telephoto lens, but no macro","I bought this lens to complement the stock 14-42 that came with my Olympus e420. I actually paid $101 for it at a local camera store, when Amazon was asking $300 for it (now it is down to $128).Main reason I bought it was to get some reasonable tele-power for my camera, and the price certainly was right.While it is a very decent lens for objects 2 meters and out, it lacks macro capabilities. I do mostly nature shots, and find myself constantly switching lenses in places where I would hate to see anything drop to the muddy floor.At 150, power is pretty good for perspective shots, but not nearly strong enough for shooting birds or wildlife. Looks like I'll be purchasing more glass in the near future, something like a pancake 12-600 tele-macro with automatic IR to UV programmable filtering 8^)Olympus Evolt E420 10MP Digital SLR Camera with 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 Zuiko Lens"
3,Not bad but in general...good,"I got this lens with my E-510 (14-42mm and 40-150mm).It's my main lens for now. I don't use the 14-42mm much. it's sharp sometimes. 3 to 5 of 10 photos are excellent, the rest just decent or below. slow auto focus in light and sometime not accurate. I use manual focus mostly to get the best results. I used it with the ex-25 and I got very nice macro shots. but for taking pictures of wild life or birds this is not good and for me it's worthless for these kinds of photography. also not good for macro unless you combine it with the ex-25.In my opinion, it's better to buy the old 40-150mm f/3.5 if you can find it or just jump to 70-300mm if you have money because you almost will stop using it if you have the 70-300mm. at lease the 70-300mm excellent for macro and reaches further."
2,Fire and ice,"Argerich plays with all her customary passion and flying fingers. But what I dislike about this recording is the fact that Dutoit's realization of the orchestral parts is rather dull. If you want to hear the true glory of these works, get the Perahia/Mehta CD (Sony). Perahia is every bit Argerich's equal while being more tasteful (IMHO), and Mehta's conducting is both powerful and vivid."
1,Incorrectly advertised parts,"The product description clearly states that there are two 6 foot cables in the box. What you actually get are two 4 foot cables...My computers are not right next to my feet, so a 4 foot cable is useless to me. I purchased the product based on it providing 6 foot cables, and now I cannot use it at all.To purchase two 6 foot cables separately is an extra $40.. more than the price of the KVM switch to begin with! I cannot speak to the quality of the product since I cannot use it, but be warned to avoid this product if you need a cable longer than 4 feet."
5,What a great book!,"I loved this book! I thought Kate Cann did a great job catching the reader's attention throughout the whole book, unlike other authors. Although I found it a little confusing with the English talk, I managed. Kate Cann did a great job writing this book and I would recommend it to any teenager who is looking for a great book; and I can't wait to read the two other books in the series!"
4,Manhattan South(The Thorn Savage NYPD Series),Good read fast moving. Much like Patterons Micheal Bennet.Just sarted the second one in the series.Hope it is as good as the first.
5,Suspense-filled story!,"Read and loved Manhattan South (02)when it was Mackie's debut novel. Loved reading it again. The descriptions of New York City are accurate and enticing. The tension-filled story and plot twists make for a great page-turner. The conflict between the Police Department and the Russian mob forces Savage and his crew to face difficult, hair-splitting decisions. Obviously, Mackie draws from his brilliant career with the NYPD. I suggest reading this book first to become acquainted with Mackie's unique style and eclectic characters. Don't miss this one!Anne Fletcher"
2,High priced and mediocre,"I bought this book to learn about dice control and it is very high priced for a book with so many errors in it not th eleats of which is ridiculous advice about where to shoot the dice -- at the back of the table. I found this book to be mostly filler and not very filling intellectually. I much preferred Forever Craps by Scoblete which gave me a way to bet, who to bet on, and how to control the dice in a much easier and more intelligent way."
1,Muddled Treatise About Nothing,"Dice influencing is the hottest topic and this book came highly recommended by a couple of Internet dice ""experts"" who also sell the book themselves. When I bought the book from Amazon one of their business cards was in the book. No wonder they love the book, it makes them money!What nonsense! I have to say that I thought the book was hogwash. [..] How can we trust [the author's] knowledge of the game of craps. I got the distinct impression the author never played craps.There might be something to dice influencing but this book doesn't convince me of it. [...]"
5,Heavenly sheets,"This set was an Amazon special for $19. I needed new sheets but hate paying the high price that often goes with large sized sheet sets. I am very happy with the order. The sheets are super soft and light, with a very slight but attractive sheen. Great deal all the way around."
2,First impression doesn't hold up,"I initially LOVED these sheets and the day I got them tried to order another set. However, after being on my bed for a very short time they become stretched out and saggy. They fit on my pillowtop mattress, but they end up sliding off because they don't hold any sort of shape. The fabric is incredibly soft, but thin. My first impression didn't hold up once I started actually using the sheets. I wouldn't buy them again and I am glad I wasn't able to get a second set."
2,Ultra-soft and ultra-cheap,"These are only worth $15 on a good day. These are not what I thought them to be when I ordered them.First, these are like 100ct? Maybe? The package doesn't say, but I think if it doesn't say it's assumed 180ct. If you hold up a piece of single ply toilet paper, that's what there sheets look like. They're thin. This means that over time, maybe the course of 6 months to a year of washing and sleeping, they're going to look and feel like screens. They're soft, they're just not durable, and won't be soft for very long. Not to mention, my cat with his claws will have runs in these in no time.I'm a fan of high count sheets (450 - 500+) so these are a considerable step down. Amazon has great deals on nice sheets, so I recommend waiting for those than buying these. Those deals aren't much more than these sheets were (I think I got 1000ct for $39). I got suckered in by the price too, but really...they aren't worth it."
3,Very nice for the price,Nice sheet set for the price. Only problem is that they come out of the dryer really wrinkled but the comforter takes care of that small detail.
4,Excellent for the Price,This sheet set is very soft and exactly what I expected when I ordered it. We're very happy with this product.
5,The softest sheets,I just bought these and I love them. They are very soft. I love the way they feel. I have a pillow top mattress and they fit on there nicely. I hate to get out of bed now!
3,"Very soft and comfortable, though not big enough for thick pillowtop mattress.","For the $20 price, I think it was worth it. My mattress is almost 8"" tall, and the fitted sheet will not fit snugly all the way around it. Of course, the sheet of course just barely tucks in. So while it works - it is less than ideal."
1,poor quality,"After reading the product description I had the impression that they would have a silk or satin feel. Major disappointment. The sheets are very thin (which is fine for summer) and not especially soft. They were inexpensive and I got what I paid for, I guess."
2,sheets,Sheets were inexpensive and the quality of low. The weave is not very tight and they do not look good.
3,Odd fit,"Bought the sheets in ""full"" size, and the Duvet & Shams in ""Full/Queen""because this is the size of my Down Domforter. Have never had a problem with the fit before, but this Duvet is probably more Queen than Full/Queen as there is over a foot left over after stuffing my quilt in it. The Sheets are wonderfully soft, and I love the look and feel of them...if only the Duvet Cover would fit. It is too soft to hold its shape with a heavy comforter in it. Otherwise, I highly recommend the sheet set, but unless you have a Queen Quilt, don't buy the Duvet Cover."
5,IF THEY WASH WELL...,"W. MAYS AND D. PARHAM ARE RIGHT ON TARGET. I JUST RECEIVED TWO SETS, DESERT ROSE AND PEARL.. THEY'RE SOFT, HAVE A SUBTLE SHEEN AND FIT WELL. THEY ARE QUITE THIN. IF THESE SHEETS HOLD UP IN THE WASH AND DO NOT PILL AS DO MANY ALL COTTON SHEETS OF HIGH THREAD COUNT, THE FIVE-STAR RATING WILL HAVE BEEN WELL EARNED."
4,Some problems with the copy,"This film is considered one of the best of immortal Carlos Gardel. However, the quality of the copy is far from being satisfactory. It gives the impression that this DVD is not produced from the original negatives, but from one of the copies shown in movie theaters. On the other hand, non Spanish speaking viewers can hardly understand the conversations, since English subtitles cannot be turned on. The disk seems to have some technical problems."
5,Sunny days!,"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm is a charming story. I have read it and re-read it countless times and it never fails to bring a smile to my face. The tale of an impoverished girl growing up to see the bright side of things is touching. I loved the quaint writing style. Overall, 5 stars!"
4,A beautiful book that stirs the heart.,"I found this book to be very enjoyable. Kate Douglas Wiggins does a superb job of introducing us to little Rebecca, and we grow to love her by the end of the book,though by then she has grown from a ten-year-old girl into an intelligent young woman. This book also captures old-fashioned life in the New England area. All in all, it is a relaxing and inspirational book."
2,Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm wasn't a bad book...,"But it wasn't exactly a great read, either. My mother bought this book for me when I was about seven years old. Back then, I thought it was rather boring and hard to get into. Fifteen years later, I picked it up again, and my first impression remains the same. The author spends a great deal of time telling you how unusual, engaging, and unique her heroine is, but throughout the book, Rebecca's actions never back up the author's assessment. I felt this book was dry and flat. Who wants to read a book in which the climax revolves around children selling soap?I found it all too similar to L.M. Montgomery's ""Anne of Green Gables,"" in story and characters, except the ""Anne"" books are so much better!! Anne is the heroine who is unusual, engaging, and truly unique."
3,Okay Book,"This book is okay. I wouldn't read it more than twice. It was really boring till the end. Then it got good. I would recomend this book to kids from ages 9 - teens. Rebecca has a life that i would never want. She is so happy and bouncy. I don't like that. In my opinion, this is book is not very exciting. I was so glad when I finished it. Because then I could read a better book. It was kind of hard to follow, cause a lot of things were going on at once. I really think younger kids should read it. I don't think it deserves a classic. But that is just in my opinon. Read it if you would like. I just didn't like it. It was okay though. So good luck!"
3,Final Grade: a C-Plus,"As far as compilations of oral literature from subsaharan Africa goes, this is one of the best. The problem is there aren't very good ones to compare it too. The translations are weak, in that they are vague and incomplete. The author reduces the African stories to the simplest sentences in order to be as brief as possible. Surely the story teller, in story telling mode, were more eloquent and elaborate. However, this is lost because the book is more concerned with giving accounts of numberous African stories rather than giving detailed accounts of just several.Also, the colonial mentality of the author, though not as severe as his European contemporaries in the early 20th century, shines through. Thus even by around 1972, when this compilation was completed it was largely based on stories collected and written by the author and other European oral collectors decades earlier, during colonialism."
1,"Very Best? Uh, not really...","This is a collection of Millie's recordings for Jive in the 1980s & 1990s. It is nothing spectacular; there is some R&B, some pop, some rock. This would be the ""mainstream"" version of Millie; nothing provocative or explicit here. This is not the Millie ""best of"" to have unless one has all of her 1970s music and wants to hear something new & different."
2,"Not perfect, but has it's own merits","Loyal Millie J. fans know this is just crumped up studio stuff that we dont have a taste for but, I can appreciate her voice and conviction. Some songs come off as Tina Turnerish (which ain't a bad thing, really) however she loses her soul in many of these recordings. Like I say, when Millie or the executives try to sell her to the masses, she looses something very good about her personal style. I respect this set of songs but true to the butt kicking realizm of Millie J., there are other better and more entertaining (highly entertaining) collections to listen to. The Jive period was not my favorite anyway but again, it does have its merits. This is Millie on a Sunday when all I want is Friday Night with the Saturday break up thang!!!!!!"
4,"Beautiful, but check out Fischer-Dieskau in the earlier set.","Beautiful, but check out Fischer-Dieskau in the earlier abbreviated festival performance."
3,20th Century Masterpiece,"This is a towering masterpiece fully worthy of the last century.It was recently given a full-scale production by the San Francisco Opera. (What more appropriate place?) It was the talk of the town. It achieved delirious praise in all the reviews. And it died at the box office, becoming one of the reasons that the following year's season was cut back by a third.As with many 20th Century masterpieces, I would not listen to it for a second time if you put a gun to my head--but don't let my Philistinism unduly influence you open-minded music lovers."
4,Good and Concise,"I found this to be a good and concise summary of PeopleSoft security. While this information is totally found in white papers and PeopleTools documentation, it is presented in a clear and concise manner. What it does not include though are the links between primary security sets and application specific requirements (i.e. H/R Globalization and H/R defaults). It also does not go into specifics on Portal Synchronization and some of the ""undocumented features"" that go along with it. On the whole though, I recommend it for those who want a concise, easy to read PS security manual."
1,The Expert Guide to PeopleSoft Security,"The title may have expert in the name but this book is far from it. The author rehashs the same information ,what little there is, in most of the chapters. All of the data can be found in the 101 PeopleSoft manuals.I found it very disappointing."
2,Poor picture quality,Picture quality leaves alot to be desired. My DVR recording from TCM was 100% better. Will research more before I buy older movies.
3,This DVD has one 1921 version and one 1936 version of the film,"How sad that the moral puritans took control of the film industry in the 1930s. The silent 1921 version actually has people kissing on screen and the feelings the love story evokes are much closer to Dumas's book. The 1936 version has been turned into something very sappy and sentimental. There is no denying that Garbo has a great screen presence, but she doesn't really play a pleasure woman very well. She is not lecherous enough. In the 1921 version it is clear that Armand is in love with a call girl. In the 1936 Armand is in love with a fairly reputable woman what wants to improve her social status through marriage. Clearly more acceptable to the moral puritans. Finally, the 1921 version has marvellous art deco set designs. I give two stars to 1936 and four stars to 1921."
5,GARBO`S MOST FAMOUS,"MGM was the king of the movieworld in the golden era, and they produced the greatest moviestar ever, GRETA GARBO(1905-1990) (Greta Lovisa Gustafsson). In CAMILLE(1936) Greta Garbo was the height of her beauty and fame - and made the part of the dying courtesan her own. Robert Taylor also great as her Armand Duval. Directed by George Cukor. With QUEEN CHRISTINA, Garbo`s best film."
5,Camille,I have not had a chance to view the movie as I have gotten it for someone for Christmas. I will let you knowMike
2,MGM GLOSS BUT GARBO RUINS THE PICTURE FOR ME!,"I know I am in the minority here but I find Greta Garbo annoying. I actually couldn't wait for her to die at the end of this picture. Her coughing and gasping (calling it acting)is to me, overdone and I can hardly understand her. In my personal opinion she is way too overrated as an actress and movie star. Robert Taylor, with his matinee idol looks is simply there for decoration.THe DVD itself has an o.k. transfer but it could have been better. Warners needs to do a better job with remastering theirfilms. The bonus extra of the original 1921 film with Rudolph Valentino and Nazimova is MUCH, MUCH better!!Anyhow, this film will disappoint none of Garbo's admirers. I just do not happen to be one of them."
2,"well, theres still ninotchka","garbo is, as usual, gorgeous to look at but this mawkish george cukor take on the dumas classic (which, btw, isnt very good) is one of the more overrated 1930s movies. robert taylor is a petulant little sissy as the love interest, and lionel barrymore is wasted as his overprotective father. this is an unfathomable mess. however, interestingly one of the extras is the 1921 film with nazimova and valentino: vastly more watchable, and the only reason id recommend someone acquiring the dvd."
2,Boiled Swede,This movie shows that Swede Greta Garbo had the acting range of a swede...Robert Taylor's hat deserves a special mention for eclipsing the Mad Hatter's!
3,Mediocre DVD transfer,"This great classic has finally come to DVD and what has Warner Brothers given us? Lovely new artwork for the cover and the same old tired print that has been used for the VHS copies for the past 20 years. Scratchy, contrast occasionally rough, and lots of remnants of age. I'm sure they were working with the best print they had, but why didn't they bother to restore it -- the technology is available and relatively inexpensive. I'm happy to have this wonderful film on DVD, but that doesn't forgive Warner Brothers for not bothering to restore it to its original magnificence."
4,No Exception Here,"West Coast jazz, as typified by the various members of Howard Rumsey's Lighthouse All-Stars, was often referred to as ""cool,"" as opposed to ""hot,"" which always seemed like a subtle rap against it.....as if the music was lightweight and less worthy. Nothing could be further from the truth! These guys swing and swing hard each and every time out. The music on this CD, recorded live at a 1955 concert at Laguna Beach, is no exception. Everyone's playing is worth hearing and, as was the case with the Lighthouse groups, various band members get a chance to appear in what was referred to as ""the solo spotlight."" I especially enjoyed guitarist Barney Kessel on ""'Round Midnight"" and pianist Hampton Hawes on ""Walkin.'"" Of course, I had heard of Kessel and Hawes before, but this was the first time I had the chance to hear them play. I also really dug the catchy opening tune ""Witch Doctor No. 2."" All of the Lighthouse All-Star recordings are worth owning; this one is no exception."
2,Ouch...,"This is true erotica, with hardcore BDSM. If Fifty Shades of Grey was racy for you, this book is way, way to advanced. As typical with Anne Rice, it's a great story in need of editing. So you will zone out at times. There was so much rape in this book, and no outrage about it. That bothered me so much. Hell the book starts off with a rape. I must admit I'm hooked and definitely be reading the next installment, Beauty's Punishment."
3,"Better than the first, but still, the endless ass-whacking!","This book was better than the first because the characters were better developed and more emotional and kinky than in the first book. But, why all of the endless ass-whacking. Anne did a good job with this one, but there's very little Sex and too much S&M"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Beauty's Punishment is not as good as the first book in this trilogy, and does tend towards the dull side through reasonable portions of the novel.Beauty and Tristan, having been busted in the act, so to speak, are auctioned off and sent to separate places for a bit more extreme discipline, having not learned to do as they are told and keep their favours for their owners."
3,an intro to fantastical bdsm....,"so, ok, a lot of her descriptions are trite obfuscations of `setting' and character development is weak, but who cares.getting to the meat of the story lines, there are some very applicable erotic arousing scenes of one-on-one sadism/masochism and sexual `torture'. it was really an eye opener for me about the relationship between master/slave, that is obviously an element in our society today. at first reading i was drawn in, but quickly started to flip faster to the very explicit sexual parts. a most enjoyable book, in terms of it's quaint period setting and possible arousing segments. and i think almost anyone can read it and `find' something that too lurks in their heart of hearts..."
3,Book review,"I absolutely love Anne Rice, but this book and series was a little too over the top for me. And believe me when I say I'm not a prude when it comes to romance novels! Great writing, but a little too much for me!"
2,It was Ok...,"If you are reading it for the sex then you might like it but I like plot as well as character development. As I read the story I was hoping Beauty would be killed or something. Woe is me, woe is me. Yea it sucked the circumstances that she was put in, but the way they went about dealing with it or looking at it to me was way too accepting or shallow."
2,Not so great!,"I liked the first book in this series because it had a plot and I kept wondering what would happen next. This book contained so much sex that it bordered on ridiculous. After a while I got really fed up with the whole thing and just thought blah-blah-blah.But there were good parts too of course. We got to know Beauty a little better. And this book made us feel less sorry for the 'slaves' and understand them better. I suppose you can say that in this book, you really understood the mindset of the slaves and what drives them.This series is not for everyone. It's basically just a sexual fantasy. I say fantasy because most of it was unrealistic. It would be impossible for everyone to be beautiful (both slaves and masters) in real life, and if everyone had unprotected sex there would be diseases, pregnancies etc.But I would recommend this series to people who want to broaden their perspective on sex. You'll learn new things by reading it."
5,can't list it here!,"I read this book a few years ago. If you are offended by ""somewhat"" kinky literature, do not read this. This has s/m, bondage and fetish overtones (to say it mildly). I liked this book and I thought it was arousing!"
2,Never as good as the first one...,"I agree that there were quite a bit ""wet and wild"" scenes in this book, but in no way should be compared to the first one. This novel, lacks a plot really. It surrounds Beauty and the beloved prince Triston. It happens over in a matter of days which is nothing at all. If you enjoyed, ""The Claiming Of Sleeping Beauty"" stick to that one.... Maybe ""Beauty's Release"" will be better!"
3,Sleeping Beauty Trilogy,Arrived promptly and in the condition promised. Would have been nice to know a bit more about the book content- very graphic.
1,this was the absolute worst book i have ever purchased.,"I previously was a fan of Rice novels, but in this she has lost her mind."
4,Wow!,"Good read, excellent story! Anne Rice does an amazing job! Exhilarating tale! Definitely takes you to another world! Brings whole new meaning to term ""punishment""."
2,Not for me,"This trilogy was one of my recommendations on Amazon and Goodreads...while the writing was good, the storyline was way outside of my wheelhouse. I've been wanting to try Anne Rice for some time and while others may enjoy it, it was just not for me. FARRRR too much spanking, seriously every page someone is getting spanked. bleh.That's $26 and a week of my time I'll never get back. I'm not even finishing the series...I stopped after book 2, can't believe I even went on after the first."
3,Beware!,Based on the Rape of Sleeping Beauty Anne Rice has written this series as an over erotic S&M fantasy story featuring Sleeping Beauty and others in humiliating acts of submission and torture.
3,Not as Good as I thought.,Not as good as I had hoped. It was kind of disappointing. She does better vampires and mummies. Overall not so impressive.
1,OMG_,"Horrible. Good for those that think that these books are sexy, erotic- but damn personally I found them disturbing and disgusting. Really sex slavery is just not my thing, I guess. But if you do not mind boys turned into horses, and girls turned into sex dolls taken on by the entire military unit- then by all means. enjoy.If you are into ""sex slavery"" then try out Sweet Persuasion by Maya Banks. Serena has a fantasy to be someones sex slave and in comes the handsome Damon to make her dream come true. He treats her with respect and she is in it on her own wishes.Sweet Persuasion"
1,relaxing,"I found the contents of this book very boring, chapter after chapter were the same thing without much story to it....very disappointed."
1,Not up to Anne Rice's standards,"This book has little plot or character evolution. It's repetitive, dull and not the least bit sexy, even though that's just about all of the subject matter. If you're looking for the same thrill and fun of Fifty Shades . . . this book is definitely not it."
3,The Beauty Trilogy - A Clever idea ... but falls short.,"Anne Rice was on the right track with her refreshing notion to put an erotic spin to a beloved fairy tale, yet unfortunately, fell short of my expectations. For instance, none of the characters' personalities ever quite fully developed, leaving little chance to connect with any of them. The story was flat with no spark, no passion, no ability to ""feel"" anything other than, ""Oh, no! Not another spanking!"" I give Anne 3 stars out of respect for her as an author and her clever approach, but there is so much more to erotica than beatings. For those of you who would truly love to experience erotica at it's best, I highly recommend Miranda Reigns' newly released novel, CyberWebs. Miranda's descriptive writing and vivid imagination will transport you into the heart of the story, allowing you to see, hear, smell, taste and feel all that Miranda does and has done to her."
1,"Oh, dear Lord.","I read all three of these books, partially out of train-wreck syndrome and partially because I was working as a tow-truck dispatcher and was bored (the other dispatcher got them from the library and passed them on to me, because I read fast.) They were so un-exciting I felt no shame at all reading them at work.But this one, out of the three, was the absolute worst. I can sum up the reason in two words (SPOILER ALERT, and no, those are not the two words): THE CAT.Oh, God, the cat. Whether or not the concept of bestiality squicks you, the practical concerns of a cat licking a sensitive area? OW. Take a look at a close-up picture of a cat's tongue - go ahead, I'll wait. See? That there's nature's Velcro, man, and not the soft fuzzy side of the Velcro, either, either. But apparently in Anne Rice world, that doesn't hurt at all.I'd long suspected that Anne Rice was, in fact, two sandwiches short of a picnic, but that confirmed it."
2,Disappointed,I only read this book because it was recommended if you liked Fifty Shades of Grey. Unfortunately it isn't anything like it. It is cruel and disturbing. It lacks characters that draw you in. Fifty Shades is ultimately a love story and has characters that you want to stay with and finally see happy. This series eventually gets there but its just not worth the journey.
4,Years ago this was my first,I had no idea at the time that anyone wrote stuff like this. My girlfriend read it first and then presented it to me. It certainly changed our relationship. I like to think for the better. Anne does a great job of morphing this fairy tale into something far more interesting.
3,Well done erotica,"Beauty leaves the castle in order to fulfill a period of service in the village. Prince Tristan joins her there and the reader is privy to his experiences as well.Tristan's chapters are written in the first person, while the rest of the book is told in the third person. It's a little disconcerting, but not confusing at all.The final chapter of the tale was quite compelling and really left a reader excited for the sequel."
2,Tango Argentine,"Not what I expected. Liked the music CD but the instructional DVD was that of American Tango, not Argentine Tango with confusing language navigation. I kept the music CD and donated the DVD. I'm usually very happy with all your products with this exception."
1,The level I received is not true.,"I spent several man days using this tool in the installation of a staircase. I discovered after it was complete that at least one of the planes is not true. It was at least 5 degrees off!! I spent much time and material reworking the staircase after I discovered the defect. I confirmed the defect by comparing the performance of this level with several other levels that I have used over the years, once I suspected it wasn't true."
2,Laser Pointer level,"Not worth the money. If you are looking for laser pointer, get something else. You have to almost lose the screw in order for the laser beam to turn off."
2,Nothing special,"Everybody is right, the on/off switch is terrible. Laser is somewhat accurate. Level rather heavy to keep in tool pouch. Basically a torpedo level with a playtoy for a laser. If you need a good, accurate laser, stick with the PLS series."
3,Just a level.....,"I bought this laser level for a simple, short grading project. It's not up to the task though. The advertisement states accuracy as being +/- 1/4"" at 50 feet. During a sunny day, you can't see the laser dot for more than than 15 feet. If you're needing something for use in the daylight hours and outside, find something brighter because this will not do it. The switch could have been much more positive as far as the on/off and the other reviewers are dead-on about accidental turn-on in the tool bag. The level feels solid, being milled from solid aluminum, but this thing wouldn't last with rough use. Block or brick work?..Only if you're careful and you're doing masonry work inside the house with lower light. Good concept, but just not taken far enough and a brighter laser would have made this level soooo much better."
3,"Whoops, I think this has The Goat, not The Boat","Well, The Goat is also one of Keaton's 4 or 5 best shorts-- a great Kafkaesque setup in which Keaton's picture is accidentally used for an escaped criminal and he can't figure out why everyone runs from him in terror."
3,First true Keaton feature (sort of) minor but enjoyable,"Keaton's first real attempt at a starring comedy (after The Saphead) hedged its bets by adopting an Intolerance-like structure that would have allowed him to cut it up into three shorts had it failed. Happily, it didn't and he soon went on to greater things. He plays three romantic losers vying for the same girl against the same bully in Caveman, Roman and Modern costumes. A minor but breezily enjoyable comedy; the tape is rounded out by My Wife's Relations, which is the one real dog among his short films, and The Boat, which is one of his best (it includes the famous image of Buster going down with the ship, only his porkpie hat remaining on the surface of the water)."
5,Enchanting,"This book is a collection of magical stories. Ray Bradbury writes with eloquence, and all his stories touch the heart. His intelligent, welcoming, and transporting style of writing never ceased to amaze me as I slid myself into the pages of this book day after day. Better than just inducing amusement or entertainment, these stories made me think about my world, my relationships, and myself. This is a wonderful collection of tales that will stand the test of time. It's a tremendous work of contemporary literary art."
4,"A six-decade tour of Bradbury, sure to please","A collection of mostly unpublished short stories from the genre's master. When he's at his best, Bradbury's genius creates some wonderful gems. ""Sixty-Six,"" a story about time-travelling dust-bowl Okies, is one of the best. In general, many of the later works printed here are as good as his earlier.Bradbury uses ""Chrysalis"" and ""The Transformation"" to deal with issues of race by considering what it's like to be black and want to be white (in the former) and what it's like to be white and forced to be black. Even from the perspective of late 40s America, both seem contrived and bordering on racist. Regardless, the rest of The Cat's Pajamas is a read worthy of any Bradbury fan."
4,Good fit and tough.,Pros: Good fit. Tough plastic.Cons: Not a huge fan of the look but that is all subjective.I've always had weathertech floor mats in my previous car and decided to take a chance on these. Overall these are a better fit than the weathertechs that I had. They do a nice job keeping all the dirt in.
5,This is the BEST Cd Ever,"All i have to say is, this is the greatest cd ever, EVERY song is AWESOME, its definitly the best cd ever and Ant Banks is awesome, songs like Parlayin and Streets of Oakland are great, buy this cd NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Breathtaking,"It is a simply stunning performance, based on the talent of three unique musicians. Argerich is somehow the leading power of the trio, while the rest are no less worth praise for their great musicianship. Communication between the musicians adds to the superiority of this recording. Last, but not least: it is a live recording, and any sensitive person can feel that. It may not be the most immaculate perfomance ever recorded, but it has such an atmosphere that cannot be easily achieved in any studio."
5,Courageous,Heard author on WBAC with Jim Bishop. What an incredible story. Deborah Layton's writing style is engaging and powerful. It's a great gift idea & especially easy since amazon will wrap it for you and send it anywhere.
5,facinating,"This is the story of Jonestown from the inside. It's told by one of the members of Jim Jones'inner circle. Deborah Layton makes no excuses for her actions and doesn't ask for pity. The book shows how educated, intelligent people can be drawn in to these cults. As the book goes on and Ms. Layton tells her story, it is possible to see how Jim Jones gained people's trust until they trusted him with their lives. This book is great for anyone interested in the psychology and inner workings of cults."
5,many stolen lives,I loved this book. Thank God Layton had the brains to run and the courage to speak out. Why does the world dismiss its whistle blowers?
5,POIGNANT,"The tale which resides inside the cover of Seductive Poisoning should be required reading for all high schoolers from 9th through 12th grade. It is a story that resounds for days thereafter. It has all the qualities that entice and retain one's interest: PASSION, POWER and ADVENTURE. From beginning to end Layton's account is vivid, absolutely engrossing and courageously honest. I loved reading it and--if one can admit to something so tragic in our history--never wanted it to end."
5,Breathtaking,"The most abosrbing memoir I have ever read. Any descriptive review on my part would be lame and not do justice to the author. What she has done is magnificent. She took me inside her head, heart and life with Jim Jones. What a gifted writer. What a profound book. Thank you Ms. Layton for trusting us enough to share this intimate part of your life."
5,Common Threads of the Human Condition.,"Unlike the press in their zeal to sensationalize an already unfathomable tragedy, Deborah Layton offers her first-hand experience as an invaluable learning tool for those of us seeking to improve the human condition. Whatever your personal beliefs about the Peoples' Temple and their movement, put them aside, open your mind and understand just how like you they really were and are. Ms. Layton is to be commended for putting her own emotions in check to benefit the greater purpose,...""each one, teach one"". Read, digest, and learn from this powerful book."
5,Incredible and amazing story,"I read this book for my History Assignments, The Influence of Cults Over the Centuries. I imagined the project would be boring until I read Seductive Poison. What happened to Deborah made all the sense in the world to me. I could understand how and why she would belive in and follow Jim Jones. I realized that her expereince in Jonestown is not all that remote. It does happen. I thought I would find that those people who join cults as very different from me, but this book has made me realize it can happen to anyone. It all depends upon where you are in your emotional developement, young or old. I was deeply moved by what the author went through and wish everyone had the chance to read this incredible book."
5,This book is a MUST read!,"I love to read, but I don't get blown away by a book too often. This was one of those books. The author does an awesome job of putting her arm around you and taking you with her on her tragic journey through Jonestown. It is a chilling introduction into the world of cults - and I hate to use the word 'cults' because this book makes it clear that this happens to ""normal"" people. ... After reading this book, it is easier to understand just how dangerous it is to allow someone else to think for you. I strongly agree with the previous reviewer who suggested that this book be added to the required reading list for high school and college students. In fact, it should be added to everyone's list!"
5,I could not put it down,"Isabel Allende's quote on the back of this book says it all: This haunting book, written with candor and passion, reads like a thriller. I could not put it down! My feelings exactly. It's extraordinary!"
5,History made exhilarating,"I have never read anything like this before. I am researching a paper on hysteria and cults and this is the only book that made it visceral. The web site for this book (of the same name) has a wealth of information for those who want to read more about it. The government sites, NPR which Layton 'appeared' with Noah Adams and lots more. My professor touts this book as the only non fiction work which begins to explain cult life from ""the inside out"". It reads like a Steven King thriller."
4,GOOD BUY,Book came within a short time and was in the shape that seller told it was in and even better.
2,Should have ended 200 pages earlier!,I picked up this book because of the top reviews but found that after about 200 pages it got very repetative. What a tragedy...but personal memoir was just to long and self gratifying for me.
2,does not ring true,"while nbasic facts are probably true,many of the stories seem to have been contrrived for dramatic effect."
2,People's Temple member tells all.,"Jim Jones screws her on the bus, on the men's room floor, publicly humiliates her, and she still goes to Guyana with him? Still this book will be useful for cult or mass psychology purposes."
5,A story about an Extraordinary girl and unbelievable event,"My great aunt was a member of the Peoples Temple and I never understood much about it. Actually, my parents wouldn't talk about it and the incident has become an emormous family secret.I came across this book at the Library, then ordered my own because it is so interesting. It explains alot and takes the ugly shameful stigma I have associated with the event away from those who joined and my auntie. This book helped me understand what happened and I want my children to have access to it so they can see how to protect themsleves from sweet talk'n preacher men or boyfriends. Seductive POISON should be part of our middle and high school children's cirriculum too. I'm grateful the author was willing to tell this very sad but helpful story"
3,Interesting but self serving,"I agree that this book made for good reading, but was also struck by the self serving nature of the telling. Ms. Layton appears to be rewriting her personal history--particularly her relationship with her mother--to appease her own conscience. And her elaborate justification of her brother's actions can only be an attempt to persuade the parole board to look favorably on his case. Read it for its entertainment value, but bear in mind the author's hidden purpose in the venture."
5,Enter another world and then BEWARE,"I was transported into a strange world, in a far off place, lived, feared and prayed for my well being, then escaped with the author. Truly a seductive story and mesmerizing accountI agree with other reviewers that this book SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING for all high school teenagers and the adults that love and cherish them! It can happen to anyone's child. This book takes you into its reality. I am wiser for it."
5,"Gripping, telling and harrowing",Ms Layton's memoir is extremely well written; has a great flow and maintained my interest throughout. It was not only a fascinating story but a revealing historical document. It is a must read for everyone. My seventy-four year old mother is now thoroughly absorbed in the story and is getting her seniors group to read it as well. From my point of view this is a worthy story and quite educational for people of all ages and every walk of life.
5,Got excellent reveiws in Great Britain,"While traveling in England I read several exceptional reveiws of Seductive Poison which picqued my interest; bought the book, read all 416 pages on the way home and time ""flew"" by. An amazing woman and story reside upon this memoir's pages. It was worth the 14'odd Pounds I paid. Has great photos of author's family and of Jonestown as well."
5,This book is a sure winner!,"Plan to read this book in one sitting. It's difficult to put down. Every page is as thrilling as the next. The author did a great job in telling this story. I doubt I'll find a book this good for a long time. Even though it's a complicated story, it never gets boring. I almost feel I lived the story. This should be required reading in every high school."
5,AN ENGROSSING THRILLER READ,"Light a fire, pull up your favorite reading chair and take an incredible journey into the hinterlands. Seductive Poison is one of those rare books which will transport you into another world where evil lurks, right and wrong are transposed, sanity is clouded and where a young heroine resides. It will give you insight into a historical event none of us could understand--UNTIL NOW!"
5,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!","Thank you for putting into words and scenes what I thought had happenend to my grandparenets. All the other books on this subject were by non members and seemed to degrade the followers and their reasons for joining. My grandparents were good, honest, hard working, kind Christians and I'm ever thankful for your explaining what took them away from me. Everyone inside the Temple became a prisoner. You were brave to tell this story and I am forever in your debt for setting me free from the mystery surrounding my grandparents deaths."
5,"If you want to understand the hows and the whys of the Jonestown massacre, read this book.","Very simply, it seems impossible for outsiders to understand and appreciate what the members of the People's Temple went through. Since most insiders who had intimate knowledge either died in the jungles of Guyana or in some way bear responsibility, Layton's candid account is probably the closest we will ever come to knowing the facts of the tragedy.This is one great book."
5,Absorbing,One of the extraordinary aspects of Seductive Poison is its ability to transport you to another time and place. Deborah Layton's fresh and powerful voice is a treat in the often self serving world of memoir. Hers is a moving and transforming tale of life and death in People's Temple and her own rebirth after the Jonestown debacle. Layton's ability to allow us far more than a peek into the dark world of cults is nothing less than a work of genius.
5,Barney Kessel CD,"Great cd in the collection of the poll winners, the trio is great as are the first two cd's by them."
1,Videotaped with no production value,"This is not a quality production. The camera angles are bad, the sound quality is bad, and the video quality is like a 15 year old VHS. And yes, I'm talking about the DVD. Since it was made in '93 on a shoestring budget at an alternative concert (no, it's not Sunfest, it's Sumfest), what can you expect? Even hard core Mutabaruka fans would probably find themselves only watching it a few times and then trading it in for a $1 at a CD exchange. Yes, I'm talking from experience."
2,Blah,Nothing interesting at all here. You could do just as well by doing a search of recent Businessweek articles.
4,Humorous and insightful!,"Gulley writes great humorous stories that give us insight to his ""Harmonious"" life as a Quaker pastor. The stories are of everyday life in a smalltown with characters that are not only humorous, but very believable. Gulley is not judgemental and has no problem making fun of himself in his stories. This is a hilarious and easy read."
1,Can I get a refund?,"I, like many others, enjoyed reading the earlier books in the ""Home to Harmony"" series. In fact, I bought the whole set after reading the first one. But after reading ""Life Goes On"" I feel like I've been duped. It is obvious that the ridiculous caricature of Dale Hinshaw represents the author's own narrow view of conservative Christians, of which I am one. I will not continue to repeat what has already been detailed in the other negative reviews this book has gotten, but I am in total agreement with them.I felt betrayed as a loyal reader of his novels. Gulley's true colors are finally being displayed in lights, and I for one am now off the Gulley bandwagon. Fortunately, there are plenty of other excellent Christian fiction writers out there: T. Davis Bunn, Jan Karon, Ted Dekker, Frank Peretti, Robert Whitlow, Beverly Lewis, Judith Pella, Ray Blackston, etc."
2,Is This Good Reading or a Political Novel?,"I bought this book because I felt that the story was good and I liked reading about this pastor and his church of hard to get along with parishioners. I have worked at a church before and know what goes on in the day to day world of churches. I felt that the politicizing that went on and equalling a true Christian with being a liberal thinker, and that conservatives were narrow minded and like Dale Hinshaw was a slap in the face. There are those of us who are conservative and believe in the Grace of our Lord and do not judge everyone they meet. We all sin and in the Lord's eyes our sins our equal. I would like to say I won't share this book, but then I would be considered just like the characters in the book who read the book but were narrow minded. I want everyone to read this and see how this writer has made this more a political book cutting down Conservative Christians."
3,A Disappointment,"Philip Gulley is well-known for his amusing look at the quirks of small town life and the ministry within a struggling Quaker congregation. While his earlier efforts in the Harmony series are full of humorous anecdotes and eccentric but lovable residents, Life Goes On turns sullen and bitter more often than not. Gulley is at his best when writing about the de-throned Sausage Queen, the observations of local farmers about the weather, and the travails of the local waitress/sweetheart. But the main characters, such as Sam, the long suffering preacher, and Dale, the overbearing elder, have become increasingly one-dimensional and sour. Where once these characters were flawed yet endearing, they are merely flawed in this book. The Harmony series remains one of my favorites, but I for one am hoping that Gulley regains his stride in future efforts."
4,Concise but Brief,A decent overview of different bible translations. Would have liked a little broader look at the issues he touches on. A good introduction though.
2,Misleading Title,"One would expect a fair and explanatory treatment of the subject from the title of this book, but this is not the case. The title should read: Choosing a Bible: Why You Should Avoid Dynamic EquivalenceThe book is a quick read and very repetetive. I recommend it only so far as you are already familiar with the subject matter and want to add fuel to your own fire in agreeing with the author that word-for-word translations are the only way to go. If so, the author provides several examples illustrating this point fairly well.The author is very passionate about asserting a very narrow view... if you are actually looking for guidance on choosing a bible, I cannot recommend this book."
2,NOTHING ORIGINAL HERE,"I bought this CD while visiting the USA on the recommendation of a good friend who knew my love for all things guitar and SRV. This is like SRV at the age of 8 with an ordinary singer. The songs are predictable and nothing special, you can almost hear the tracks that inspired each of these compositions. His playing is OK but also nothing special. He stays so close in tone and styling to SRV that buying this CD seems totaly superfluous when you could buy SRV's CD's instead. Whoever the reviewer is that called this the best BLUES CD of the 90's, must have absolutelynothing to compere this to. This wouldn't make the top 1000 BLUES CD's of the 90's."
4,An Artist in his own right,"I'm so tired of people saying so and so is a ""fill in the blank"" wannabe. So what if some of his licks sound like SRV, he's an artist who plays what he wants to play and was probably very strongly influenced by artists like SRV and others. Doesn't make him a Wannabe, he's just playing that style of music and very well if you ask me. Don't get so hung up on comparing artists to the people that came before them, they may show signs of influence but deserve to be reviewed on their own merits. Hell even Clapton and Duane had influences but no one called them Wannabes. Fine album in my opinion."
4,If you like this kind of music...,"OK, so there's a lot of familiar sounding riffs on this disc. I can say the same for any of the Motown classic discs I have, but i still love them all.He's definitely ""got the gift"" on the strings; vocals are decent as well. If you like Kenny Wayne Sheperd, Minnesota's own Jonny Lang, and the ""Stevie-sound"" you'll enjoy this CD. Manage your expectations accordingly..."
3,Promising debut.,"This is a fine start for Duarte. This is solid blues-rock with Duarte's guitar at the forefront, where it shoud be. There's not a lot of orginality, but he makes up for it with fire in his playing. I disagree with Amazon.com's review in that I think his voice is fine. Cerainly not great, but servicable. It's his songwriting here that I find weak. On his next CD, he makes up for it. But if you like to hear Austin-based blues rock, this is as good as any to pick up."
3,Good not great,"I got turned on to Duarte from a Warren Haynes charity christmas concert disc. I took a chance on him and he plays some nice Texas blues he has some of the SRV feel. Can he play yes, is he good yes, but does the disc make it into the rotation, not too often."
5,Best blues album of the 90's,"Chris Duarte is without equal in the world of blues rock today. His mastery of the guitar and incredible live shows are unbelievable. His sound is Stevie Ray Vaughan transformed. His music adds much more funk, punk and drive to that Texas blues sound. Duarte's songs have great feeling, and the louder the better. This is a must have for any blues fan. Check out the tracks ""My Way Down"", ""Scrawl"", and ""Big Legged Woman"", they are incredible!"
3,Not a good representation of a true buddy show,"I'm a long time LIVE Buddy fan. I was at the recording of this disk. I'm sorry, but although it is a good disk, it is a POOR representation of Buddy Live. His normal band was nowhere to be seen, and instead the Saturday Night Live band played. Ugh! Who's idea was THAT! Let's get a disk that shows the way a REAL Buddy show sounds!"
5,"Astonishing,historical performance of a genius!!","This is an historical album.A rare opportunity to hear the magical guitar of this great bluesman at his own home the Legend's.Here we have a Buddy Guy with intense,gutural,sensuous voice,a testimony of a genius,that plays like no other,with heartfeelings,and sustained by a great band.This is a cd for those bluesfans,those Buddy's fans!!!"
3,"Not the best, but its Buddy Live","Yeah, its overproduced, but still is a good album. It has some of the greatest vocals (check My time after a while), but if you haver ever seen Buddy playing live, this is not what you get. Also, get the video, because its so different watching Buddy than only listening to him. Also, the version in the Cd of first time I met the blues is not the same as in the video, and its a shame, because the video has a killer guitar solo. In the Cd instead of Buddy the solo is by some guy with a sax!"
1,Not the recorded selection I expected,"This album surfaced on Amazon as a result of my web search for a marimba recording of ""Japanese Woodcuts"". The description led me to believe the piece I was looking for was on this recording. It didn't ship for several weeks (it was previously owned), and then when I received the album, ""Woodcuts"" was not on the album. Very disappointing order."
2,False Advertising,"The stand itself works well enough. My major complaint with this product is...Every website that sells it (including Mad Catz's website) says that this fan/stand powers through the Xbox 360's rear USB port. This is an out-right LIE! Not only does it not come with a USB cable, it doesn't even have any place to plug in a USB cable. Instead it comes with an AC adaptor that must be plugged into a standard wall outlet to provide power. I give it 2 stars since my main reason for purchasing was for the ability to power it from the console and it DOES NOT do that.- Josh"
4,Finally... a cooler that doesn't draw power from the 360.,"After the problems with the Intercooler, I've been skeptical about drawing power from the 360 to run any external fans... I even charge my controllers via my PC... (call me paranoid...)But I found this unit, and it does exactly what I need (cool) without messing with any internal power drain...The charger is an afterthought, but I do like the remote stand. Flashy green stands and the infamous Intercooler can stay on the shelf... this does what I need and saves my 360 from wear and tear as well."
3,Outdated material,"I purchased this book in August of 2005. [...] Should have returned it, but most of the info. is still worth while knowing. The copyright of the book I received is 1998. So when it comes to any internet purchasing or research info., the book is lacking. It still contains a lot of important tips to know before buying a car. I'm sure the most recent edition is great."
3,Average Dummies Book,"Has some great tips but the tips are for someone who can take their time buying a car and really wants to play the game. In this weaken ecomony I not sure people are going to use most of the tips. Also, book is geared for someone who has no idea what they want in a car and not for someone who wants a specific car and is trying to great a good deal."
3,OK but too old,This book may be OK but too old. Many information are outdated. I will not read any dummies book older than two or three years.
2,In Search Of Stones,"In Search Of Stones, in my opinion, does not measure up to previous books by Dr. M. Scott Peck. His choice of using megaliths as metaphors for revealing his human frailty is clever but not prophetic. He concludes that civilization has removed the mystery from some megalithic sites and casually brushes off stone formations that leave him feeling empty. One wonders if the man or the megalith is at fault. If a site, such as Clava Cairns, does not cause an epiphany, or at least a sense of spritual feeling, he theorizes that the orginal constructors lacked creativity. Perhaps it is he who lacks the understanding of a deeper spirituality that withdraws when he approaches. When Dr. Peck explains away the sin of adultry as being his need to connect with God, I do not wonder that some sacred places cause him to feel empty.."
2,"Not bad, but not 'advanced'...","This book, like many of Telesco's earlier books, gives a good overview of many useful subjects. However, there are too many subjects for any one to be covered very deeply. Also, I did not find anything in this book that is not covered in a good basic Wicca class, or in basic pre-dedicant or first degree training with a good coven.It is a good introduction for those who are just moving past Cunningham or Buckland's basic books, but is certainly not 'advanced'.Blessings,Sana"
2,"Misleading title, but not a bad book","While the book clearly does not present anything advanced, it is still a somewhat decent book. At least it was nice to not have another re-hash of the customary fluffy nonsense so abundant in Wicca books today. However, essentially this is yet another beginners book, but with some material bordering on intermediate. It's a worthwhile read in general, but don't have your hopes up of learning something new here."
2,Not Advanced!!! Beware of title...,"I bought this book in hopes of reading advanced material. It mentions things that are told in most beginner 101 books, then gives a brief summary of what glamoury, shapeshifting, ect. are, but never goes into depth on how to do it, has no material worth learning from, you probly heard it anyway, dont waste your money!!! its not advanced in the least bit!"
3,Truly Interesting!,"I always love to read Patricia's books and always will keep reading cause she is from my ""hometown"" (sorry, we like to root for our hero's here :) ). Anyways, i loved the book, but, i really didnt see anything that was advanced though, but, it was a truly great read that i truly enjoyed."
4,"An excellent read, well-written and interesting","If you are looking for a hard core, easy come sex book, this isn't it. If you want to read a story that has some intelligence, some heart, some fun and will make you think, then give this book a try."
2,Very Tame,"Author Marianne Macy investigates various aspect of the sex industry, including escort services, strippers, female coaches for masturbation, dominatixes, transexuals, etc. Macy began this as a magazine story idea, and spends a certain amount of time interviewing various sex workers and employers looking for workers - but not prostitutes. This result is a surprisingly tame read, with very little sex, and not all that much insight. Some will dislike the author's acceptance of such activities, while realists understand the futility of letting moralists enforce puritanicalism on a society where consenting adults are supposedly free. Those looking for a voyeristic read will be disappointed and are advised to look elsewhere."
2,Superficial and unsatisfying,"The book consists of interviews with people working in different areas of the sex industry. The problem is the author's agenda clearly stands out- normalizing such work and subtly criticizing any negative views of the work or workers. She also is rather superficial in the interviews. She does not really delve into their pasts and the reader is left wondering if a significant number of the interviewees had dysfunctional backgrounds. She would have us wholeheartedly embrace such work as legitimate and useful, and as just another job choice for those with lesser means but she does not present the costs (to the person, his/her family, society, etc.) of engaging in these morally questionable lines of work."
1,never recieved,I ordered these at least 3 times and always recieved the giant grape clusters. So I don't know what they would be like! The ASIN numbers were mixed up and I was afraid to try it again. First time I ever had trouble with Amazon. Too much hassle for these. Truly don't believe these are even in stock.
3,Can't get excited about this one,"I've been searching for more ball workouts. This one was recommended here, but I have to say, I was very disappointed with my first try. I just did not click with this instructor, and I found her bland and unmotivating. I didn't even finish this workout, because I was just bored. I'm intermediate to advanced, and need some enthusiasm from the instructor to keep me motivated. This one will not be in my rotation. Very disappointing."
4,Easy to Follow Workout that WORKS!,"This video is wonderful to do in my living room at home. The instructor is pleasant and makes working out an enjoyable experience. The first time I did the workout, I thought...this isn't that bad! However, later in the day and ALL next day I was sore all over. I like how it works you out without feeling like it. I am not watching the clock waiting for the torture to be over... I highly reccommend this video and plan on getting others made by this instructor.The reason for the 4 stars is the video quality...it is semi-professionally made...some of the transitions are rough...but not bad. The workout is still great!"
2,Kinda crappy,"Number one: HORRIBLE production quality. The sound is awful.Her instruction is seriously lacking. It's like she's just making it up as she goes along. I won't deny that the lower body segment works your body, but the upper body is pretty lame and the ab segment is just so-so. There's supposed to be a 40 minute total body workout, but my DVD will NOT play it. Pretty pathetic. I have removed it from my rotation and will be donating it to my library. Skip this one."
4,"Yummy Scent, Great Results","I love the smell of this shampoo--sweet and fruity. It leaves my hair feeling moisturized and healthy, plus it's sulfate-free. It's a little pricey so I don't use it every day, but it's a good product!"
3,Nice Product,"This product is great for making your hair shine, and helping with the fly-aways. It sin't that great of a moisturizer, but it does help with shine."
1,"Bottle same, contents not",I opened my product container and the inside contents does not seem the same as the original one I purchased from the store. I will not buy from this vendor again. I thought it was the same as the bottle looks brand new. Scent and consistency are NOT the same. The Shampoo inside this container is NOT S Factor. I have been using S Factor for years.
4,Especially helpful for book groups,"I bought this book because I am in a bookgroup and thought it might be interesting for us to read, since many of the writers we've read are in it. It's also given us great ideas about other books to read. Now we try to do a book and an interview each month, and it's amazing how much it has changed our discussions! I especially like that the book only has women writers, since our group, and most book groups I know, are women, and so we usually relate to the author in more ways than just her writing. I thought this book was incredibly interesting and would recommend it highly, especially for any book group."
3,Quality Failure,"I was impressed with this scope for the money. Easy to get zeroed in and the clarity was excellent. After shooting in, it held zero. The second time I took it out the windage L-R knob became loose and it would not move cross-hair.All in all I was satisfied until this failure. It could be a fluke and I was happy with it over all.Like they say ""You get what you pay for."""
3,"Technically brilliant, but...","The piano playing is technically awe inspiring, but somehow the disk leaves me a bit cold. I listen to it fairly frequently - a sign that I like it - but I return to other peformers to get at the soul of the music (like Rubinstein)"
5,"Stunning, simply stunning","Martha Argerich's reading of Chopin's Third Sonata is superlative. By turns majestic and athletic in its pacing, this my favorite Third. The disc is worth the opening bars of the final movement alone: there is a drama here in Argerich's playing that is conspicuously absent from most other performances. Brilliant.The Scherzo No. 3 is similarly outstanding, as are the Mazurkas. Alas, the Polonaise in A-flat is lacking in the same flair and command as the Sonata, which is a disappointment.The definitive Sonata No. 3, worth the attention of any music lover. (Top notch sonics from a 40+ year old recording also make the recording a gem.)"
4,"Not Argerich at her best, but still very impressive.","Argerich's playing is nothing short of miraculous. It's as if God's most precious gifts had been all bestowed upon her - she makes other pianists pale in comparison. This record is no exception, even though it's not Argerich at her best. At times her playing here is too straightforward, too agressive, yes, even too intimidating, and I don't know if she's really being faifhtul to Chopin's music. It sounds as if she's intent on shunning people away from playing the piano and effacing every other interpretation from the face of the earth. It just doesn't fit Chopin's music all that well, but it's still worth buying and listening to thousands of times."
5,Exceptional Work!,"As an onwer of far too many CD's, this ranks number 2 on my list. The piano in this is absolutely amazing. This is a CD you will want on when you are sleeping, eating and any other time your ears can listen. It is simply transporting. The only CD I've heard better than this is John McArthur's, Hidden album. This Chopin is a must for any fan of his work!"
3,Good For Practice Work,"This rice paper is good for practice work. It is very thin but takes the sumi ink pretty well. Since I have not found any kind of practice rice paper in stores for under eleven or twelve dollars a roll, the price for this brand is reasonable. It is also of a better quality than some I have bought and used from stores. The roll is made up of about 15 sheets measuring 15in. by 50 inches which are stacked and folded and then rolled up. This folding makes it necessary to take care in separating the sheets from each other or a tear may occur. I rate this paper a 3 because it is not the best paper from China. But then again, the really good paper cost quite a bit more and is too costly to be practicing on. As a practice paper, it is quite good and will give the beginner a good sense of how rice paper reacts to ink, water, and brush without paying an arm and a leg to find out. It is worth trying."
3,Average,"He is certainly a skilled artist, but there is no depth of perception, no artism or mind twisting virtuosity that one can see in Beksinski paintings."
2,Short-lived Joy,"I successfully used the Targus PAPWR005U power inverter on a 400+ mile trip to power my Mac PowerBook G4 (to watch DVDs) with the kids. Unfortunately it only made the one trip. The next week, on another 400+ mi car ride, the inverter started beeping constantly and then went into shutdown mode, I'm assuming because it was drawing too much power and was overheating. At 90 Watts, the power output matched the power draw from the Mac PowerBook, but didn't have enough umph to spare. I'd caution everyone to check the power rating on their laptop power bricks first before using it with a power inverter. Get an inverter that is at least 1.5-2x the power rating of the device you want to use."
2,WTF?,"The first and only time I tried using this for a legitimate need was when I plugged in my laptop to it. It started a long, continuous, high-pitched signal and flashing a light. What does that mean? I stopped using it immediately, since it probably couldn't mean something good. Was it drawing too much from it? There are no instructions to tell you what this means. I tried going to the web site for insight on this, but just got the same info as what was on the package. No help. Nice concept, now only if it worked. I'm returning it."
1,Not beefy enough for my laptop,"Borrowed my daughter's to test it out before buying one for myself. Plugged my Compaq R4000 notebook in and got about 10 minutes worth of computing done before the inverter's yellow light started blinking and the ""shut me down"" alarm started chirping. I removed the plug from the cigarette lighter and the metal was hot enough to burn me.Not recommended."
1,Waste of too much money,"Like half the reviews here, mine worked great a few times and then nothing. It's now been over two years since it worked properly, I guess I'll throw it out."
4,it was not what I expected,I purchased this item so that I can heat up water but it could not handle the wattage and it did not work. I have a bad back so I put this item in my car and attached a small heat pad. Now I have a happy back when I drive.
4,Had one for years,"I had one of these for several years. I used it on several long trips. I've powered both a Lenovo laptop and a DVD player at the same time. I used it every day to power cell phone charger and a CD player. (Car CD player died, so bought a cheap one that used AC power). The DC outlet never worked well, and I gave up on it. It was much quieter than other power inverters I've used. It finally died recently, and I needed one quickly, so bought a different model I could get in a brick and mortar. I liked this enough that I may buy it as a spare."
2,3rd Time Was Not a Charm,This unit worked fine the first two times I used this (about and hour or so ea session) but when I tried to use it the 3rd time....nothing! This was a refurbished unit I bought so I guess I get what I pay for but this will be returned.
3,Didn't provide full power; no useful documentation,"I've used this for about a year on small loads without problem.Today I tried to power my new laptop, and the PAPWR005U freaked out - it shut down, the LED turned amber & it beeped continuously. The laptop draws 80w, so there's no reason the PAPWR005U (rated to 90w) should have a problem. I tried a different load, slightly less than the laptop. The PAPWR005U stayed on & the LED remained green, but it began beeping at me: 2 beeps, pause, 2 beeps ... What the hell does that mean?? No help at the Targus website.Honestly, Targus, why not document your products for your customers? Extremely frustrating.I would not recommend this inverter if you need to power anything like a laptop or larger."
4,Great little device,"My family uses this on those long car rides, and because we have a lot of portable electronics (DVD player, iPods, Mobile phones, and more) it really provides a flexible solution for keeping us in power.My only complaint is that the unit could be a little bit smaller. Otherwise, it does what it says."
2,100 volts?,i only get about 100 volts out of it at a full 12 volt charge. with engine running. not enough.
1,"cold, lifeless, passionless","Despite what other reviewers have said, I know this score very well indeed and I find practically everything about this recording incredibly offensive. The voices are bleaty like sheep and there are many times they don't hit the notes the score says they should hit. The music is blurry when it should be crisp and clear. Yes, it has Terfel, but he, along with all the other vocalists,doesn't make me believe the character. There are better recordings of this piece. JEG should've stayed away from this piece... It should be full of fun, joy - it should move you. Instead, I was just bored and angry. Not an accurate reading of the score."
5,An essential version,"The music of Stravinsky's wonderful opera THE RAKE'S PROGRESS is a surreal juxtaposition. While it is unmistakably 20th-century, it also hearkens back to 18th-century opera. But the 18th-century references and motifs are often presented in a distorted, ironic light, as if viewed through an acerbic modern lens. In this recording, John Eliot Gardiner conducts the score little differently than he would conduct Handel or Mozart. He draws crisp, clean playing from the orchestra, with livlier tempos, classical-style phrasing, and the lean, spare sound that we associate with ""period"" performance. The result is that the music sounds both classical and bitingly modern - the perfect combination for this quintessential work of Neoclassicism. I will not elaborate on the soloists, who are all excellent and stylistically match the orchestral playing. This is an essential version of this Stravinsky masterpiece to own."
4,Tiger Woman,"This vhs for Tiger Woman reminds me of when I was young and going to the movies every week to see another chapter I enjoyed it then , but now I can see the art in making this movie> I still think it is the best. R. G. Davis"
5,Spiritual Disciplines for Christian Living,"A biblically based look at spirituality, which the author defines as the goal of all Christian living. The book looks at some basic biblical concepts, personal responsiblities, and practical issues affecting Christians today. The study guide in the 25th Anniversary edition really complements the text by providing an opportunity to evaluate your own spiritual life topic by topic. It even allows room for those who might disagree with some of Dr. Ryrie's conclusions to develop a scriptural rationale for their positions.Also recommended: Knowing God, J.I. Packer So Great Salvation, C. Ryrie True Spirituality, Francis Schaeffer"
1,Has stainless steel in clasp and back of watch,"I'm not sure this is the best watch for nickel sensitive persons. The backing on the watch is stainless steel as well as the large clasp on the back. Otherwise the watch seems to work well.Addendum- I have been wearing this watch for about a month and have not developed allergy yet, it's probable nickel free steel on the clasp."
4,should come with maginifiers,lots of detail... should come with magnifiers... Had my 6 year old daughter help me put it together..Just wish it was Made in USADamn I am getting Old
5,Barney Kessel at his Best,"Always a favorite of mine, Barney Kessel and the others put out the kind of music that made jazz such a phenomenon. Straight-ahead, upbeat, smokin' solos over popular standards. A joy for everyone from musical ""technique freaks"" to folks who just want to hear some of the best have some serious fun."
4,I'm not blind,"This book tired me out.But I'm glad I finished it.Being a fan of Saramago's I kept at this book and was thoroughly rewarded by the inference to his book Blindness when he mentions 'the shower enjoyed by those 3 women' - I felt he'd let me in on a secret, and it made this read worthwile.He's a careful character - and if you get to know his work, hopefully you'll see more than is actually written."
2,I wanted more from this book,"I am not very well-versed in Saramago's work. I admit it took me a while to get used to the style. It wasn't really the lack of punctuation that got to me, it was more the lengthy sentences, which by the time you finish them leave you somewhere entirely different than you started. I also was a little put off by the presence of the narrator/writer's voice. I kept feeling like he (the omniscient narrator) was sort of intruding on my reading experience and telling me how to feel. Aside from those issues, I got through the book and yet felt disappointed. The notion of finding a double and what that would mean to your identity was really not explored as it could have been. This is a fascinating concept, but I felt as though Saramago got too hung up in building the story based on action rather than introspection and meditations on self, which is really what I wanted from the novel."
3,A great author but not a great book,"Stylistically I didn't appreciate Saramago in this novel as much as his others (maybe I've been reading him too much or maybe the translation isn't as precise.)Neither did I find the characters and story as engaging as Blindness or All the Names. Although I still believe this is an exceptional author and I look forward to his future novels, The Double seemed to drag on too long and offer fewer insights than expected."
3,"""The Usual Supsects"" of Books","I'd like to consider this an equivalent of sorts to the film ""The Usual Suspects"". More specifically, both are slow and plodding eventually ending with a bang. Keep in mind though, THE DOUBLE does not quite match THE USUAL SUSPECTS as a 'whole'. There were times where I'd fall asleep and sometimes doubted whether I'd even want to finish the book however finish it I did. The last few chapters are quite impactful and the ending gave me a chuckle but I'm still bitter about the rest of the book. Slow and with lots of 'filler', the story drags on for far too long."
1,"This book gave me a headache, literally.","This book gave me a headache, literally.The wording is not beautiful or clever. It is just plain awkward and annoying. I had to put the book down and take medicine and lay my head down for awhile.I don't care how good his story idea is. This book hurt me. And it gave my friend a similar headache, which is why she gave to me for free.I'm used to reading drawn-out, convoluted, cryptic writing, both prose and poetry, however...This book just hurts."
2,Long Advertisement,"This video is essentially a running advertisement for the Cob Cottage workshops. It profiles the owners and operators as well as several graduates who have gone on to build their own houses / start their own companies. There is no practical information contained in this DVD. For a better resource, I would highly recommend the book The Hand-Sculpted House. It is by the same people that run the Cob Cottage and is full of useful information, philosophy, images, etc."
1,"What happened, Val?","DOUBLE IDENTITY made me double angry for wasting my afternoon watching it and I only suffered through its entirety to submit a fair review. Val Kilmer must either owe a favor, need the money or someone has something on him (ie: videotape, pictures?). Or all three. Not only was the plot weak and the acting mediocre, the story was too convoluted. Even the pseudo-love scene looked contrived! Val, Val, what are you doing?! Remember THE DOORS? I guess a free trip to go film in Europe is cool and all but c'mon, where has the substance gone? Low budget is good, weak stories are bad. Maybe the script read really well but the final product is a complete failure. Hopefully he got cozy with the lead actress, total babe! Not recommended for anyone."
4,SCHMALTZY :-),"I liked this movie. It's great if you are not a movie critic or some other snob.A great popcorn eater!!!!!!Man gets mistaken for someone he ain't. Gets involved with an absolutely beautiful girl (Izabella Miko) that any guy would kill for.All kinds of things happen to him and her, but in the end they come together and live happily ever after.Great Schmaltz. Pass the popcorn!!!!!!! :-):-):-)"
2,Boring Mistaken Identity Film,"Double Identity, also known as Fake Identity, is yet another dull addition to a string of straight to video movies by Val Kilmer. The film takes elements from North By Northwest, a mistaken identity film by Alfred Hitchcock. It's equal parts smooth British spies, expressionless Eastern Europeans, and cutthroat diamond merchants.Val Kilmer is uninspiring as a hapless American doctor in Bulgaria that ultimately travels to Prague to evade his assailants. The movie's cover is misleading, as it portrays Kilmer as something of a spy or action hero. Helping him along the way is the lovely secret agent played by Polish actress Izabella Miko (Athena in Clash of the Titans).The direction and cinematography are both decent, but the acting and writing both are sub-par. The film lacks an original story, and just isn't suspenseful. I wouldn't suggest even renting this movie, as it will only remind you of how hard Kilmer has fallen off since the 80's and 90's."
1,Avoid at all costs,"Where to start... The movie centers around a case of mistaken identity. A very out of shape (and quite possible intoxicated) Val Kilmer plays the lead, a doctor mistaken for a spy. Miraculously Kilmer somehow becomes Jason Borne in the process. There are double and triple agents involved, none of which are properly introduced. The viewer has no idea who is working for who (and not in a good way). The plot lacks any sense of direction and the acting is simply terrible. Set in 1992, all the characters use cell phones and drive cars from the mid 2000s. It is impossible to follow and the viewer has literally no idea what is happening throughout the movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie even out of a RedBox. Instead, save yourself a dollar and 90 minutes of your life."
1,Double the Confusion,This film absolutely had no direction - almost as if it was made up as it went along. The viewer is then stuck trying to follow a plot which then all of a sudden changes for no reason. I agree with the other two reviews - horrible film and Val Kilmer adds nothing to it. This film was just as bad as The Ministers which starred John Leguizamo - and that film was one of the worst in recent history.
2,Don't Be Fooled,"I've always liked Val Kilmer's work and thought ""any movie he's in must be good."" Well, good grief, this flick sucked big time. It was impossible to recognized a plot line and even fizzled at the end. Unfortunately, I bought this movie and now wish I had only wasted my money renting it. Sorry, Val! Is you're career really in the tank? I sure hope not!"
2,Not very good,The storyline is thin and confusing. Kilmer turns in a decent performance but the overall movie isn't worth the time it takes to watch it. It's sad to see a great actor like Val Kilmer reduced to such sub-par b-movies.
5,SPELLBINDING!!!,"This is the first book of her's that I have read and I was so enthralled I couldn't put it down, literally. I haven't read a story that held my interest so much that I couldn't stop to cook supper till I finished it. As it builds near the end she made me feel as though I was a part of the story and one of the characters. She is a spellbinding author and I can hardly wait to read the trilogy I bought. Thank you so much Miss Canham and I look forward to reading all your books."
2,Suprisingly Disappointed,I usually adore Marsha Canham. I just didn't like this one. I didn't feel the poignant love and passion that I got from other Canham books. There was lots of steamy sex but wish there was something more. Usually I'm absorbed in her descriptive storytelling and can't put it down but I couldn't even finish this one. JMO!
4,"WHY, OH WHY ???","First three-fourths of this story was highly entertaining producing smiles, sighs, chuckles, and quite a few gasps but sadly, last fourth turned into an awful soap-opera using just about every cheap cliche in the book. Such a shame as up until that point it had been a joy to read--the story, twists, and romance wove a sensual spell and using the Natchez, Mississippi area (which is spellbinding in itself) was a pleasant change from the normal London crowd. The characters, both good and evil (and there was one whose evil knew no shame,) had been so vividly brought to life and the descriptions of the post civil war struggles were enlightening and not biased toward either side. Marsha Canham has such a wonderful way of spinning a yarn and though I don't love all of her books, I've never wanted to throw one across the room for wasting my time."
4,"Expensive, limited number of circuits 40248 Generator",You must purchase this item with the 40248 7000 watt generator if you plan to wire the generator into your home circuits due to the ground fault interupt built into the generator. It is really just a specialized breaker box. The cost is excessive for what you get and you have to buy it which is a rip off. All the breakers are 15 amp. Most homes these days are wired for 20 amp service. Since you have to rewire all circuits run by the generator permanently to this new breaker box you are de-rating all of these circuits form 20 amp to 15 amp. The number of cicuits in the new box may be less than many people would like to run on the generator.
3,pita,"The quality is good. B+S customer support is ""talk to your local dealer"" do yourself a favor and avoid a ground fault generator if at all possible, and you won't need this. then you can get an easier prewire. or a cheeper unit. did i say gfci generators are a pita?"
3,This book is very fun to read,SNAPS is a fun book to read for the teen who is witt-challenged and likes humor.
2,NOT What You're Looking For,"This book has intersting tidbits about the history of the ""Game of Dozens"" and a few of the jokes are gems, but it has too many OLD or BORING jokes that really should've been filtered out.I don't know how it happened, but all the good jokes ended up in the SECOND ""Snaps"" book-- none of the others in the series can hold a candle to that one...Just look at its Amazon[.com] ratings compared to all the others. Now THAT book DOES have what you're looking for...funny funny funny insults that you haven't heard before."
4,Works,I bought this as a replacement for the horn on my silverado because I damaged the stock one going through very high water. Install wasn't too bad except for the stock horn location was almost impossible to maneuver through. Wiring was very simply and the supplied bracket was adequate. The horn works but leaves a lot more to be desired. I was expecting something a little louder.
1,Do not buy this piece of crap!,Read quite a few reviews before purchasing this for my BMW which lost the use of its air horn setup. My wife makes more noise than this when she snores! This is the wimpiest excuse for a horn I have ever heard. Very disappointed. Would have sent it back if it wasn't so much of a hassle. Reaffirms the old adage - you get what you pay for. Don't waste your money.
3,"Great horn, misleading ad","While I really like the FIAMM Freeway Blaster, the description is pretty misleading. The horn gets 5 stars, the ad one, averages to three. One of the descriptions writes ""high or low tone (one or two terminals)"" That's totally wrong. The 72112 is only the low tone. If you want the high tone you need the 72102. When they write one or two terminals, that has nothing to do with the high or low tone. And since you can't return this item, I'm stuck. I bought four, two for each of my bikes. Now I have to re-order two 72102's - there goes the free shipping. One other point says ""Universal or right angle bracket"". Really it's one bracket - you can bend it if you like."
4,Great Motorcycle Horn!,"This is a great replacement for the stock horn on a motorcycle. It is noticeably more loud and is an easy install too. It requires no relay unless you add both the low and high tone. I have heard both low and high and if you choose one, I would go with the low tone. Amazon was the best place to buy with the free shipping."
4,please,"this is definitely not 130 DB, it really is tuned well and sounds sweet but not close to being a freeway blaster, i would say its about the same volume as the two HS horns that i took out, i replaced them thinking they were shot but it turned out to be the relay was bad, but i must reiterate, they sound clean and well tuned. but i am giving it 4 stars for not being loud"
3,Not freeway loud,"NOT as advertised. NOT as loud as a ""big rig"". Maybe a little louder than a stock HD motorcycle."
1,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE,Buyer beware: Fiamm is a company that has no sense of customer service and does not own up to any defects with its product! I can only hope no else has the same experience I have had.
1,No boten la plata / Waste of money,"Compre este pito para reemplazar el de mi Vulcan VN900 Custom SE, esperaba supuestamente un cambio radical en la potencia del sonido con respecto al pito original, pero que decepcion los supuestos 135 Db son mentirosos totalmente.Con la primera lavada de la moto el pito dejo de funcionar, comenzo a sonar como un ganso y casi inaudible........una verdadera porqueria de pito, que plata tan mal gastada.I bought this horn to replace the original Vulcan VN900 Custom SE horn , i was looking for a radical change and expected a real power horn!! but this one was a HUGE deception!! The suppossed 135db are totally fake.!!!I washed my bike a few days after install the horn, it turns like a goose and like 5 Db!!!, A ringer bell sounds more.......it's a crap horn......do not waste your money with this."
1,Avoid any product from this company,Connected up to a 12v source and it sounded like a mosquito buzz. Called the company twice and left messages for them to call me. That was 6 weeks ago and no call back. The customer service email from the website is no longer valid. I wasted $15 for the product and shipping.
4,Nice and loud,"I put this in my 2002 Sunfire. The only thing that wasn't great was that the horn is not designed to take the connector on the car. You have to cut the connector off and install generic connectors on each wire. Never-the-less, it was pretty easy to install and works great; sounds great."
5,Works for Ninth Gen Corolla,Plug and play installation for a 2008 Corolla CE. Much better than the puny factory horn. Sounds like a mid or fullsize sedan horn.
2,"Not impressed, air horns way better....","I bought different horns, in fact the ones i am using are not this one. This horn is just as loud as the original horn. I boght air horns, low and high tone and WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!! Get air horns instead!"
3,Not loud enough,"Not loud enough. After reading the description I thought these would be louder than the factory horns, NOT.Also, the sound is kind of pulsating (goes louder and lower and then louder again a lower again, I guess it's because it is air-based: compressor issue)."
3,Doesn't Blast,I hooked this up on my farm to alert me when someone came up the driveway while I was outside. I hooked a trip wire on it and attached it to a jump starter for power. It's loud enough that my dogs can hear it go off and alert me to go back to the house.
3,not very loud,I replaced the OEM horn on a Sprinter because it wasn't loud enough. According to my DB meter this is not substantially louder. Not worth the effort on a Sprinter.
3,Horn Review,"Just slightly louder then a stock HD horn. To do the job right, buy both the low & high tone horns and a relay and then you will have an ear splitting horn that the texting cage drivers may hear."
2,After 6 months it just broke in two pieces. wierd..,Everything was great the horn worked fine until one day (6 months after I installed it) the horn broke into two pieces. You get what you paid for.
2,Lasting power not good,"Replaced factory Suzuki horn with low-tone Freeway Blaster. Not much louder than OEM, but had more satisfying tone. Horn lasted about a month and then started sounding like it had strep throat and began croaking. It's a nice, inexpensive initial purchase, but replacing it every month may reduce cost savings substantially. For that reason, I give it no more than a 2. It gets a 2 because I'm sure there are other Freeway Blasters out there that last much, much longer. I'll try a different brand next season."
3,Not very loud,"The stock horn on my Yamaha xt225 was kind of embaressing. This horn is twice the size of my stock horn, but is actually quieter. The note is much lower though and is less embaressing so I'll keep it."
3,No complaints,"Bought this for my Vulcan 500. Wired easy; seems to have a pronounced tone. Original horn was broken so I can't compare it to that. Seems to draw attention, but i havnt needed it yet. It could be louder but i don't think I will upgrade since it sounds strong, and doesn't overload the factory wiring."
4,"Good quality, but not loud enough to call a ""blaster""","Good quality horn, made in USA. Very easy to install with ability to handle both blade type connectors and round plug type connectors (which my Mitsubishi pickup has), so that was convenient. No need to rewire anything.Though the new horn is strong and clear, and is certainly better than the Road Runner cartoon ""meep meep"" of my factory horn, it is no louder than any ordinary car horn. Perhaps using both the hi and lo notes would help (I bought only the lo note), but neither the packaging nor the amazon description state that two horns are required to achieve the ""freeway blaster"" sound level I was hoping for. I'll keep it, but 4 stars for the ordinary volume level."
5,Great Horn Upgrade for Corolla 09',Bought this with the high tone model (#72102) as well to upgrade my dinky stock horn. You need to make sure you have additional mounting screw bolts and be able to splice the power wire. Works great for me!
5,Packed With Knowledge!,"This slim volume, which draws life and business lessons from the game of chess, is one of the better self-help and self-improvement books you're likely to pick up. At only 115 pages, double-spaced, and a mere 20,000 words, the entire book is about the length of a chapter in most other books in its category. Author Bruce Pandolfini includes just enough chess lore to keep the book relevant to chess, but not so much as to overwhelm a chess-averse reader. He writes concisely, as a chess player plays, with a great deal of concentration and quick, quiet decisions expressed in single sentences. The book offers several fine aphorisms, the sort you will remember long after you have put it down. But it's not the kind of book you will want to put down. Fortunately, we are glad to note, it is small enough to fit into a purse or computer bag along with everything else you carry."
5,Knowing What Is To Be.,"There are many books out there that compare business to other pursuits, but I never found one drawing a correspondence between business and chess. I am not a chess player, or a fan of the game, and frankly am somewhat intimidated by it. But Bruce Pandolfini's compact monograph is less about chess and more about logical thinking. He offers fascinating stories and unusual analogies that are easy to understand and a joy to read. Furthermore, his writing is simple but discerning, and though the book is only a little more than 100 pages, it's chock full of fresh perceptions and neatly encapsulated aphorisms. I enjoyed EVERY MOVE MUST HAVE A PURPOSE so much I read it twice and gave several copies for holiday presents. I wish there were more experts like Mr. Pandolfini, with the ability to express abstractions so clearly and intelligently."
3,Entertaining but not much meat,"The book was entertaining but as a novice chess player, I didn't connect to some of his stories. I would liked to have had more explanation and connection to business. The book did however, stimulate me to read more on the connection between chess stragies and business."
3,The album Art Blakey would never make,"Tony Williams pulls together an interesting cast of players to make an interesting album. Sam Rivers, Gary Peacock, Richard Davis, Ron Carter, Bobby Hutcherson, and Herbie Hancock all play on different songs in trio or quartet forms. This CD is really not a showcase of Tony Williams' drumming, but it's about his songwriting and bandleading. Per the title of the review, rather than make the sort of album that'd be conventionally entertaining, Tony Williams went the artistic route. So, the songs are unconventional and the playing is quite free. There really isn't anything you'd hum along too, it's meant for more concentrated listening. By the same token, it's dynamic and rather quiet in places, so it better to listen to it loud to catch more of the nuances. Some critics really love this album, my three-star rating shows that I don't quite get it."
1,A Missed Opportunity,"Tony Williams was a pretty decent jazz drummer, though he wasn't as locked into hearing what the other musicians were doing as those before him like Art Blakey, Art Taylor, Philly Joe Jones, Louis Hayes, Elvin Jones, Al Harewood, Kenny Clarke, Max Roach, Charlie Persip, Roy Haynes, etc. ""Lifetime"" could have been a great record if he stuck to what he was playing with Miles. He had Sam Rivers on tenor saxophone, Herbie Hancock on piano, Bobby Hutcherson on vibraphone, Ron Carter/Gary Peacock/Richard Davis on bass. With a lineup like this, it would be hard to go wrong, but it did, this album sunk after the first couple of notes of the first tune. A huge disappoint considering the kind of company Williams kept in his early days."
4,Think!,"Answers many 'hidden questions'Although seems outdated but science, it seems, is timeless...If updated including further discoveries of modern day science will probably Wake us up'"
3,The Creation,I bought this book when I was sixteen yrs old and loaned it out never to get it back.. I am happy to have it back. It is a great book. I just wish the book would have been in better condition. Thank you
5,"A short, but great love story.","I'm not generally one for love stories, but if anyone could do it with a wide range of emotionions, confusions, and exassperations, then it would be Jack Kerouac. The flow of this novel, written in 3 days as Kerouac fans already know, literally glows in the lights of the night skies and the street neon lights. The writing coincides with be bop, as I think Jack wanted it to. The characterizations in what would sound like jagged prose to some, met perfectly with his other characters. The flow goes on with no denial, no confusion, and full understanding. I am not someone that does this for a living, as some can well tell, but I give my heart to this beautiful novel."
4,The Other Side of Kerouac,"""The Subterraneans,"" in my opinion, is a must-read for serious Kerouac fans. It doesn't exhibit the manic, adventurous, and outgoing writer that we all know from ""On the Road."" Instead, we hear a narrator that's seemingly insecure when dealing with his present love interest (an African American woman named Mardou Fox.) Sometimes depressed, self-depreciating, and at times even jealous! This novel is truly an account of how quickly and easily a man's whole personality can be altered by a woman that he's infatuated with. As the two characters' very different lifestyles become entangled with one another, Kerouac almost drives himself crazy with his constant speculation. If you're a die-hard fan, pick up this book as soon as possible. Aside from being simply engrossing, it's a very short read."
3,Limited but amazing,Almost limited (as with most Kerouac books) to his own experience. But he does manage to apply his experience to the rest of us in this one. What made Kerouac great was his ability to expose himself so completely in his writing. That takes guts and it shows in his work. And because of this The Subteraneans is so amazingly honest. It would be fair to say the most honest account of a love affair in modern American history - maybe. It's a unique little book and amazingly honest.
4,Just A Warning...,"This is a great book, but difficult. I just want to warn people who are picking this up because they loved ""On The Road"" or ""The Dharma Bums""-- this is a different kind of novel. This book is not so much a linear story as a mood. Kerouac wraps the reader into a bizarre world of lonely parties, flashbacks, and long conversations. Very little actually ""happens"". However, if you can push your way through the hyper sentences of random disconnected thoughts that run on for pages, you will be amply rewarded."
1,Not writing; just typing,"This is a poorly written and overly praised book. Its only claim to fame is as an account of Kerouac's one night stand with Gore Vidal, which Vidal also discusses in his memoir, Palimpsest."
5,"aptly titled, jack's best",Jack's fated masterpiece. His method in fifth gear with ideal subject matter.
4,The agony of love,"Probably the finest expression of the pain experienced in a lost relationship. Beautiful, honest Kerouac. Not altogether coherent, but push through and enjoy fine passages."
2,"Typing, not writing...","I appreciate that many people love this book. I also appreciate that it should be read in its historical context and that it was groundbreakingBut, if I am honest, reading it was a chore. Dull, dull, dull."
2,Don't leave it in your toolbox,"This Capacitance Meter works just fine if you leave it in a conditioned environment, but I use mine in different locations and after I put it in my tote-bag in my truck - along with all my other instruments - I found that this Elenco was the ONLY tool that warped up terribly to the point that the meter-scales on the front were unreadable and the plastic case itself was warped. It was not even a super-hot day. Even the much cheaper imported volt-meter and related tools sustained NO damage from being in my truck. I can not recommend this tool at all."
5,Unconditional love,"This is the kind of movie you want to share with family and friends. Some of my closest friends are getting it as Christmas present, specially those who own dogs."
3,A Faithful Dog,"This is a lovely little book about a dog and the professor to whom he was devoted. It is a true story, and Hachiko was a really beautiful dog, faithful to the very end."
4,HACHIKO WAITS,I PURCHASED THIS BOOK BECAUSE OF THE TELEVISION MOVIE AND WAS DISMAYED TO LEARN THAT THIS ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE IN JAPAN NOT IN THE UNITED STATES AS PORTRAYED IN THE MOVIE. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A MOVING EXPERIENCE I WISH IT HAD BEEN MADE IN THE ORIGINAL SETTING AND TIME FRAME. I FEEL THAT IT WAS SOMEWHAT OF A STRETCH OF THE WORD TRUE.
4,Ray Brown:King Of Bass,"Ray Brown has been putting the low end on jazz records since the late 30s probably. His sound is always heavy and well in tune with his fellow musicians. On this CD there's a pretty good group. Art Pepper plays very inspired sax and the legendary trumpeter Art Farmer switches to flugelhorn .This accents his lyrical talents and the magic is apparent on ""Downwind"" and""My Funny Valentine"", a horn/piano duet with Hampton Hawes. I've been getting into bebop recently from the 70s and I see that there was more than fusion going down because this album does'nt sound like a session of vets from the 50s (though it is), it's forever modern music."
4,This is not her best record,"The most famous record Sarita Montiel had called ""La Violetera"", with songs like:Sous les ponps de Paris, Palloma blanka, Mimoza, La Palloma and many others great songs. This record (La Violetera) was sang in the movie: ""Scent of a woman"" with Al Pacino.I would purchase several CDs of La Violetera! Please let me know if you have it."
4,Smells great but do the ladies like it?,"As all scents go you either like it or you don't. I'm not too big on aftershave, cologne, etc... but this particular scent had received some 'positive feedback' when I'd used it several years ago.I'll give it 4 stars because I have yet to have any women flock towards me uncontrollably - but I'll be sure to update this review when that starts happening.The shipment arrived packaged well and fairly quick - and the bottle/container looks real cool in my lavatory!"
5,ronald delgado,Excellent onald delgado Excellent muy bueno para comprar lo haria otra vez super bien voy hacerlo cuado tenga plata eso sera en seis meses
2,Confused,Looks like the same cologne I have used for years with same name and company. It was a total different smell and it made me sneeze. I reorderd one called Animale Animale and it is awesome.
2,"Many characters, one voice","I can't agree with the other reviewers, except to say that yes, I kept reading -- in the hope the story would go somewhere intriguing, or the characters would be properly developed. Many chapters start with an internal monologue, and it's impossible to differentiate the style, wording, or even the intent of the monologue so that you grasp which character is speaking. There are some amusing anecdotes, some interesting imagery, some action passages which hold interest, but on the whole I feel this is an overlong book with a very slim and not particularly interesting story to tell."
4,Vocal Magic,"The quality of this vocal group is amazing, the arrangments, harmonies, energy and phrasing is close to the best I have heard.Individual solos are inspiring and the overall professionalism is at a level few achieve.Would recommend this c.d. for any music fan who enjoys stimulating, uplifting entertainment."
3,Confusing at times,"While I am okay with the art and the colors were great, this whole story is a bit of a mess. There simply isn't enough development to make it work. Perhaps this would have worked better as a two book arc instead of a one book filler. In the end, there is just far too much in here that forces you to believe in the most outrageous coincidences and a villain's motivation that makes no sense at all."
2,Poor inking quality,"I bought this in spite of the fact that other Amazon purchasers had not rated this pad highly. Sometimes I find the ratings are not reliable. In this case, the ratings WERE reliable. The inking is not even on the date stamp I had been using. I may return this stamp, but it's only $3.99."
1,poor quality,"This size of this guitar is good for our 2-year old, however the quality of the strings is horrible. You cannot get it tuned. The strings will not stay tight and they break very easily."
1,suitable only for pretend,"We were really excited to get this but it's not really playable, as the knobs can't tighten down and it won't hold a tune. Also the bridge broke off. But My son really liked the pitch pipe that it came with!"
1,piece of junk!!!,please don't waste your time or money!!! right off the bat i had to super glue a piece back on. then after stringing it myself (which a childs guitar should already be strung) I pulled the string too tight and it broke the whole bottom part off which holds the strings down. NOT WORTH IT!!
5,LEMME SOW YA WHOSE @$$ IS THE BLACKEST,"HA HA those were the days Krs one is the greatest battle MC of all time and if you listen to Hiphop Mainstream or underground and dont own one of his albums then you need to get with the program Hops Because whoever your favorite mc is whether it be Beanie seagall, Jay-Z, NAS, Talib Kweli, Capitol D, C-rayz Walz, Mos-DEF, or Akrobatic these MCs and thousands of other were directly influenced by Krs Ones Rhyme style. If that doesnt make him the greatest MC of all time I dont know what does. Lyricly Kris has always brought it but this album is a personal favorite on the lyrical tip. I consider this to be one of the greatest lyrical albums of all time. Beats are provided by DJ premier which is always a plus. Kris' rhyme style worked really well with preimos production it would be really sweet if they could get back together and produce another album. If your looking for a truly dope lyrical and musical album it really doesnt get much better than this."
2,KRS went hard!?,"ok . this kinda' threw me off a bit compared to his 'younger' albums . it was a MUCH MUCH harder sound and lyrics were harder . wasn't quite sure whats goin on? anyway , i realized i grew out of this phase of life and spiritually there were alot of things i couldn't get with .but,oh well thats life."
4,This is excellent,"KRS One has been stunning audiences since his amazing debut back in the 80's. Ten years later he hasn't let up. Although he brings a different style on this album, he still produces hardcore tracks like 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11.... damn! most of them are pretty good. His lyrics are dope! KRS! Where are you?! I need more!"
3,My Breakthrough,"The Joy of MagicThe song ""The Truth"" on this album was my breakthrough in terms of opening my mind to spiritual concepts and seeing the truth about life and humanity. It had a tremendous effect on me and the person I have become.Other great songs like ""MC's Act Like They Dont KNOW"" and ""Rappa R N Danja"" put this in the ranks of a classic in the genre for me personally. Great music and message from the one and only KRS ONE"
3,not too bright,"Works fine, and the automatic turn-off in daytime is good. But it is very dim, so that it barely gives enough light to find your way at night. Also, the emitted light has a bluish color that feels harsh. It will probably last 20 years, which is too bad, because I want a reason to get a different one."
5,Just what I was looking for.,"These were exactly what I was looking for. They look very nice, and give good light. Helpful for new parents like us who are finding themselves up at night more frequently. :-)"
3,Very little light out of these things,"As someone else said, if all you want is a very dim light for your hallway then these are ok.But if you want an actual nightlight so you can go to the bathroom or whatever without turning on the main light... no way.(( I usually only review stuff that I really like. But this doesn't do the job for me ))Update...these things are DIM! WEAK! To me a waste of money."
3,could be brighter,"I have a night light placed in every other outlet around my house. Its easier to see where the big dogs are rather than guessing and tripping over them. I purchased these because I like the clean white colored light instead of the yellowish tint. I thought this light would be bright enough for my bathroom but it wasn't. These are ok against the wall. They give off just enough really dim light. However my yellow tint nightlights are actually 100 times brighter. Maybe I got a set of defects?? Oh well, for $5- and change for 2 lights this really isnt a big loss. I am going to purchase 7-watt light bulbs and just buy nightlights where the bulbs can be replaced. I have been doing this for years for the kitchen & bathroom because its nice not having to turn the big lights on in the middle of the night. It would have been nice to have energy saving lights but I'll keep shopping and hopefully find some soon :)"
3,Do the job.,"They do exactly what they are designed to do... For the most part...They Offer the amount of light you would expect; however one being plugged in right under a fluorescent light was not enough to make it shut off. It dimmed a little bit but did not completely shut off like i would expect it too... Maybe it would with sunlight, i have not tried...Cant beat it for the price though, glad i only bought one pack, im going to try something else if/when i need more."
3,It does the job,"I bought these LED's as I wanted to have light when walking around the house when it was dark etc.They all work but two of them are odd, even when there is day light they still are on and even if I turn on the bedroom light they are still lit up. The rest do switch off when the sun is out or if the bed room light is switch on.Perhaps I got two faulty ones. They do a good job of lighting up the rooms when it is dark so I would recommend them."
1,"Nice looking, Robust, but far too little light","Basically, I should have listened to the other reviewers. Replaced a small incandescent nite light in my kitchen with this one. The old one actually put out a little more light than I needed - to be able to do things like navigate to/from , get a drink of water, etc. without turning on the overhead lights. This new LED barely lights up an area about 1 ft around the light itself. Totally useless for anything - can't believe they actually are still marketing this unbelievably poor excuse for a light. Would give it a zero if that were possible. Total waste of money."
2,Light is Blue-ish,"They function ok, but the light color an unattractive blue-ish shade of white. Had I known that, I would have purchased something else."
2,Good night light but comes stays on all the time,"We ordered these for my son's nursery hoping it would come on at night & go off during the day, but it ends up just staying on all the time. It is also not very bright, just enough that I can see where I am going, but not enough that I can nurse him by that light alone."
3,"Night Light - Leviton 48561-2W .5 W, 120 V, Automatic On/Off LED",hmmm - maybe it needs more light coming from my windows or need to turn on the lights but this Night Light is on right now @11:41 AM (ok maybe it's the gloomy day like today that's causing the lights to be on) or maybe it needs 24 hours getting used to my house ... idk will find out soon enough ..but right now 3 star.
3,do your research,"So I got this night light and was excited. Kinda flimsy packaging but no worries, less garbage to throw away. Picked up the night light and wow..it is pretty budget, well what can you expect at less then $4 a light?Single white coated LED bulb that lights up the immediate area around it, about 10"" all around. NOt useful for my applications but it was my fault as I didn't research it properly. I guess I was looking for a brighter night light with an automatic sensor that lights up a hallway or a washroom. This does not do that, however its cheap, and does provide adequate lighting so you dont bump or fall down stairs."
3,Not what I expected.,"After kicking the door frame, chair and everything else in my very dark master bathroom at night I decided to purchase a night light to illuminate the walk way. I purchased this night light based on other reviews - I didn't want anything too bright, just enough light so I could see at night.Needless to say I'm not all that happy with my purchase. The light, while LED and therefore efficient, is blue, not soft white. Secondly, it illuminates the entire bathroom so much that I had to put electrical tape around half of the case and close the door to keep from illuminating the entire master bedroom at night (I prefer a dark room to sleep). Once I made these changes it works okay and does the job intended.If you're looking for just a little light, I would purchase something else."
3,"Okay, but not what I expected....",the LED lights are worthless..... they produce so little light that I'm not sure there is much difference from the darkness. Will never buy LED again.
2,Not as bright as I'd like,Okay. I wish the light were a little of a warmer color and brighter. But they'll help guide you to the bathroom okay.
3,Light sensor does not work,This night light is perfect in every way except it never turns off. Even when the window shades are open and the room lights are on it does not turn off. The light sensor is supposed to turn off the night light when the sun comes up or when the room light is on. That just does not happen with this item. So when it is not in use I have to unplug it and set it aside. A little annoying. Other than that the light output is just about right.
5,Good Quality Night Light,"I needed an automatic Night Light for a dim hallway, that wouldn't burn out every 30 days. This LED should last 10 years!"
1,Uselessly Dim,"I purchased a few of these nightlights based on the ratings of others. Big mistake. If you are looking for a nightlight to replace any of the bulb variety you might be using now, forget about these. You will be greatly disappointed in comparison! These nightlights have a large bezel giving the impression they'll emit enough light, however the LED bulb is about 1/5 the height of the bezel and barely lights it's own cover, let alone a few inches around it. Run, don't walk from these. Stick with the incandescent bulb styles."
4,This isn't exactly what I bought,"When I ordered this in Nov. 2009 Amazon showed a pic or 2 lights and said it was a 2-pack in the description. I've had 2 of these (Item 48561) shipped on different dates and both were a single pack... not a 2 pack... and had to email Amazon for the missing light. Amazon has now corrected the 2-pack issue so the price is now for one light. Other than having trouble getting Amazon to give me 2 lights, without making me pay twice, it's a nice little cheapie light that does what it should. However, I paid $4.93 for a 2-pack and anything over $5 for 1 light is too much. The description now states ""Basic Manual On/Off Night Light"" and though it is pretty basic you can't turn it off... it must be unplugged."
2,not very automatic,"My family finds it way too bright for bedroom use. Also the automatic on/off does not work seem to work very well. It needs a lot of light to cause it to turn off. More light than our overhead bedroom, hallway, and kitchen lights provide. Even in daylight with all kitchen lights on, it does not turn off.It does turn off when the bathroom light is on, however in that case the lights are only about 4 feet away from each other.I've decided to use it in the hallway and bathroom and just live with it always being on."
1,This Guy is only embarising himself by releasesing this crap,This music is garbage. Busy Bee was talented he could really rock the crowed.This guy sneak attacked Busy Bee & that's the only reasion why people liek him. He desrives no credibilty since his rhymes are wack.
3,"A good book, not a great one","This Anathomy book is a good resource of information, but is not the best one. It helps a little bit when studying anatomy."
4,Good starting point for anatomy/physio info,Martini et.al gives excellent breakdowns on anatomy/phys. issues in this text. There are plenty of full color diagrams andthe lab accompany book is excellent to visualize anatomical elements: there are actually photos of a real human dissection. This text is essential for anyone going into a health care/human science related field.
2,The Anatomy & Physiology books by E. Marieb are way better,I don't think this book was very good at explaining various concepts. I prefer the A&P books by Elaine Marieb. I've taken an A&P course years ago & I belive that if I had not had a background in anatomy and physiology I would have been lost trying to understand some of the subjects covered in this book.
3,Not much of a review (from 2003) though.,This is more of a positive listener and reviewers exclaim. What I am looking for are more than what is apperant from listening to the short snaps and reading Amazons description. I like to see comparisons with other muscians and in Saluzzis case relations to other of his own recordings. I am very found of the duo Ojos Negros with Anja Lechner and am considering the classic Kultrum. On the later Lechner also appears as a member of the Rosamunde quartet. On Ojos Negros there are only two but on Kultrum a lot of other musicians. Can this have any bearing on this CD where there also are many other musicians?
2,short life?,"This product is great while working.unfortunately, it has stopped functioning after few months of ownership.I would expect a longer lifespan from such a product. it is definitely disappointing.Guess i'll be sampling the alternative products for comparison now."
4,"Good volume in a nice, compact unit","Installed this in a new Chevy Van. The van only came with a single, 2 wire horn which made replacement simple. I went the route of splicing new female wire connectors into the factory wiring and preserving the factory horn connector. For those not up for this challenge, simply cut the factory connector off and crimp on weather resistant female wire connectors. I had high expectations for a loud truck-like sound. No question that it is loud...far louder than the wimpy stock horn. It is not the deep, booming blast you get with multi trumpet air horns. Overall, I am quite pleased with this horn: compact unit, simple install, attention getting volumne/sound. As a bonus, it includes a horn relay (not needed for my application) which is not listed in any online listing I viewed."
3,loud but not that loud,It was a bit difficult to find a place to mount this on my vehicle. Montero sport. The wiring took me some time and I ran this horn with my factory horns. The sound is loud but not as loud as I wanted. It looks and felt kind of cheap on quality. We will see how it holds up over the next year.
5,"Great Horn, Loud sound,Easy to hook up","Great Horn, very easy to hook up when folling directions,Took me less than 30 min. Looks nice on my 2006 Suzuki Boulavard C90T.At least twice as loud as the factory horn.I recommend this horn to anyone. Installed 08-30-2011"
1,Sounds like a European motorcycle horn,"The Bad Boy horn is for good girls. Hooked it up to my F-250 Diesel thinking it might sound appropriate however the first time I hit the ""bad boy"" I sank in my seat and hid. My dogs were embarrassed. It literally sounds like a european motorcycle horn, not kidding.Db is decent, not great. I'd recommend a different product unless you are touring France. I don't think I'll get much respect with this in Philly traffic. (a miata gave me the finger)."
2,"Hi, or high I should say","High pitched noise, not like description. Very disappointed in product. Not too manly for an SUV horn, if you ask me"
2,"It was pretty loud, but now it squeeks like a duck!","I installed it 2 years ago and it didn't really fit perfectly in my 2002 Nissan Frontier so I may have installed it upside down (maybe that's why it doesn't work anymore), but it worked for 2 years so not sure why it didn't fail sooner if that was the case. Nonetheless, it was loud at first but now it just sounds like a dying goose when I lay on the horn. Actually kind of funny sounding. I gotta get this fixed though!"
2,This does not fit a Harley well. The bracket is ugly and poorly designed. Sounds good and loud.,I wouldn't recommend this for a Harley unless you have a place to hide this contraption.
2,NOT SO EASY,Advertised as easy to install. Just hook up the existing horns wires and you have it......WRONG. If your existing relay is not compatible with the horn you get to purchase a new relay and rewire a whole new horn button somewhere on the vehicle. They also don't tell you it is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MOTORCYCLE RELAYS. If you get past all of this it does have a great sound.
2,nice and loud for a short time,"Easy to install. This is loud, does have a tone similar to a air horn but after tow of these lasted less than two years I gave up. I don't know if its because I use my horn more than the average guy of its because its in my econoline grill and must get wet during a rain, but after a few years the horn sounds like a honda civic"
4,Good Replacement For The Sad Highlander Horn,The 2004 Toyota Highlander came with a pathetic horn that couldn't be heard above the purr of a kitten. After a couple of near-death experiences it had to go. This Bad Boy turned out to be a good replacement. It's two-tone sound hits both frequencies loudly and with gusto. Although not the horn of an eighteen wheeler it is still a great improvement over the factory crap. The directions were good even though the print was microscopic. The fit was fine but the removal of the Highlanders grill was not a cake walk. Of course that had nothing to do with the horn itself. Just hope this horn lasts because I never want to remove that grill again.Highly recommended.
3,Sounds hilarious,Ya so this horn was not what we expected. It was not quite the sound that we were looking for and it made many of faces laugh.
1,Rubbish!,"It's not loud as a truck horn!!! This horn is not even louder, than a stock horn of my Celica!!!!"
3,Not that loud,"Barely louder then the stock horn in my car. I was hoping that it would be loud and I could scare little old ladies and stuff, no such luck."
3,OK,"Not really plug and play as they make it sound. My husband had to buy other products to get it to work properly and relocate horn placement for it to work on his motorcycle. Also, not as loud as we thought it would be."
2,Didn't Last Long,Purchased a badboy horn for my motorcycle October 2009. Horn only lasted till March 2010 when it would only click.
3,"OK, but not as loud as expected","It's definitely louder than stock, but it isn't anywhere near train horn sound. I have tried several in this price range and they all are about the same. The differences in DB rating are, in my opinion, negligible, or due to optimistic manufactures readings. If you want REALLY REALLY loud you'll have to step up to a train horn compressor and tank. As far as this price range and size go, not bad."
3,pretty good,I bought a 2011 Hyundai Sonata which is a great car but has a very weak beep horn.I installed this new horn which has a high pitch and is much louder....but not prohibitive.... sounds like a Ferrari.
4,Loud... Occasionally...,"This is a very weird horn. It can be loud, but it isn't always. When its warm outside, this thing is plenty loud. If its rainy or snowy, not so much. I don't know exactly why that is, but thats how it works. Was a pain to install, but that is no fault of the manufacturer. I'm actually considering getting another one, just so they will be consistently loud enough. The tone is very cool (I think) but my wife says it makes my car sound like its carrying either clowns or rainbows."
3,It's okay,"Short answer, replaced a crappy jeep horn with this (not so) bad boy.I didn't have high expectations when ordering it and was only slightly disappointed after installing.But that's not why I am writing.The first horn I got would only work once and then -- no more BlaHTs.I got it replaced, but the second was doing the same thing -- until I realized it was blowing fuses.I switched from a 10 amp default fuse to a 15 amp -- and so far, so good.Still a cheap, funky sounding horn, but hey -- at least it is still working now."
1,Get what you pay for,This horn is barely louder than stock and it sounds horrible. If you want a air horn that sounds like an air horn don't by this one.
1,this horn fried my car,"I'm hoping that my problem is rare and unusual. I had this horn professionally installed almost a year ago, and the horn worked great up until about 3 months ago where it sounds like it was gasping for air. When I was thinking about getting it looked at it started working again for another few months. The other night I hit the horn when a car shot out into my lane and I was traveling much faster than it, but the horn didnt go off at all. I hit the horn a few times to test it, then noticed my brake service light went off.The next day my car was incapacitated and I had it towed and looked at. They say that the horn caused some sort of short and took out my Brake lamp switch which prevented me from getting the car out of park. I had to spend quite a bit to get the horn installed in the first place, and again to have Wolo horn replaced with a stock horn to prevent more liability problems with Honda.I just emailed Wolo to see what their response is."
2,unfixable problem!,"This TV has a misaligned picture tube! It is not fixable. We were unable to reach Samsung by any means to have them rectify the problem; we could only return it, which we will as soon as our next one arrives. We are very disappointed, although the picture quality is excellent and it's probably a great TV, but this is a manufacturing defect that spoils the TV's good qualities. And Samsung's unavailability only compounds the problem. Next TV: not a Samsung!"
2,Very Disappointed,"I am a huge fan of Anthrax and SOD, Speak English or Die rarely leaves my CD player so perhaps I had high expectations for this new cd. I was sadly disappointed to listen to ""Bigger than the Devil."" There is hardly any well defined guitar rifs to jam as it was set in the predecessor cd. Tt seems all they wanted to do is see exactly how far they could go satanically with a lot of guitar noise. The 1st album, the lyrics are just hilarious and the rifs just simply rock. Sadly, this cd remains in its jewel case as a dust collector."
4,Sgt. D returns to kill again!,"What a glorious day it was when I saw the hilarious rip-off cover for Bigger Than the Devil. I had waited years for this album, and while it's not quite as good as Speak English Or Die, it certainly is S.O.D. Billy's vocals are deeper now, and the music is even harsher than before. Sgt D. returns with blast beats and unabashedly METAL riffing to show the youngins how it's done. It's good to have him back."
3,What ever happened to sell-tick frost?,"This cd is ok, but not as raw or a good as Speak English or Die (a five star great album of my high school days). meh - don't pay a lot and you'll be fine."
4,pretty frggin good,s.o.d is great weather its metal or thrash metal and sometimeseven some grindcore s.o.d plays it all and the funny songs kick ass this cd is pretty good and i like the remade versionof arent you hungry
4,Good but not great,"This album reminds me of Anthrax's golden years S.O.D is a great band and this is a great album and will most likely do well. If your a heavy metal fan you'll like this album the songs are hard and heavy and will satisfy metal fans around the world. Every song is great except ""fugu"" it is very distasteful however other songs like ""ballad for Phil H"" is very funny."
3,Alright,This cd has too many joke songs on it. Tracks like Bigger Than The Devel and The Crackhead Song are good but songs like Make Room Make Room and Every Tiny Molocule are unlistenable. There's like six 10 second songs on this cd and a couple of them only last like 4 seconds. Some songs are really good and some arent. Dont buy it unless you only want 25 songs with 10 good songs.
3,pretty good cd,"if your a fan of large3.14 or destinys foot then this cd is for you,the best song is fugu which was originally done by anthony lauer,also Shenanigans is a retitled of an earlier hit called stoopin,while ballad of michael h is know to s.o.d fans as a song originally titled ballad of big roll,all in all a good cd which fans should run to their local cd deli and pickup"
2,Good but not what I was looking for.,"Tinnin's book lacked real information on fly fishing the creeks, rivers, and streams. It had too much general info. He also concentrates on all types of fish, not just trout and does a lot of explaining about the many lakes in Arizonia. I purchased this book thinking it was about the streams, creeks, and rivers, but to my surprise it was mainly about rivers and lakes. Also, I wanted it for trout fishing info, to my surprise he talks about all of the different fish. The book was a great book for the beginner to the inexperienced, but not for an expert."
4,Diva Inferno,"""Disco Inferno"" is one of Cyndi's best dance track to date. Soul Solution did an outstanding job with this production and Cyndi's voice has never sounded so powerful. It's impossible not to resist to this infectious Hands-in-the-air club anthem. The only bad point of this single is that the Plasmic honey and Boris & Beck mixes aren't really good, way too fast, and don't respect Cyndi's vocal. But there are 4 different mixes from Soul Solution and they all rock."
5,i love this song,burn baby burn. this track is on fire. I can't stop listening and dancing to this song.
3,Nice colors,Nice colors but had to throw away the pink and purple.Also they shrink quickly when washed.Otherwise baby loves to wear his blue and yellow socks.
1,too tight at ankle!,"I bought the 18-24 month old size for my 15 month old who is in the 90% of height and 40% of weight. The sock felt soft and fit her foot perfectly. But the ankle elastic part was so tight it left a dark red mark within seconds of wearing. And our daughter does not have fat ankles! I wish the ankle wasn't constructed so tightly, but I now have 6 socks that will never be worn..."
2,Fall off every time.,"I bought several in several sizes. I have very few left, as they fall off every time."
2,too tight,"as someone have already said in the review , the soks are too tight on the top, cut in to the leg :("
4,He did what?,"This ninth book in the best-selling Left Behind comes out with drama rising suspense as Trib Force members wrestle with the idea of taking the mark of the Beast vs. having the seal of God. Carpathia, as the Antichrist, continues to bask in the adoration of Earth's followers, even as he leads them to their certain death. Dr. Rosenweig shoulders the responsibility of leading Trib Force followers, even as some question his leadership. Chaim debates with the Beast, as the Antichrist takes his throne into what was the temple of God in Jerusalem. In complete defiance, the Antichrist attempts to sacrifice a pig in the holy temple, but doesn't get the job done. Even the kids get in on the action of defying Carpathia and of glorifying the One True God. The book closes with the Trib Force core again wrestling, this time with the safety of their own people, and of where safe houses are located.This was a book I reviewed for Tyndale House Publishers."
1,Desecration,Without a doubt this has to be the worst written book in the series. The book is barely readable. The story line is choppy. The characters have begun to have delusions that they are a modern day version of the prophets. All in all it is a very badly written book.
2,Looking for a Christian novel that won'y insult your IQ?,"Why do they always have to make it seem simple? Why are the chareacters always so boring? Why do they always make it seem like morality suddenly becomes black and white? Why do they always seem like they are written for fifth graders? Why areChristian novels so BAD? If you've asked yourself these questions, buy We All Fall Down. Smart, funny, and totally engrossing, this is the best novel about Christianity that I've ever read."
2,I don't know if I can keep going,"It has taken me two months to read this book, it never takes me that long to read 1 freaking book. I had to force myself to read it and I was trying to finish this series by the end of the year, doesn't look like it's going to happen..The authors should be ashamed of themselves for milking people by dragging this story out. I hope they don't think they can take all the money with them. And I refused to pay full price of any of the books, so I'm not contributing to their wealth. Thank God for library book sales."
5,Totally Awesome,"This book is by far the best! Nicoale doesn't even pretend anymore. He is totally mad, killing all who oppose him. Meanwhile, you got the bowls of wrath beginning their judgements, and christians fleeing nicoale's wrath. Also, the tribulation has been compromised, and several of the members are dying like flies! Excellent book, with a very suspensful ending as Nicoale prepares to drop 2 bombs on hundreds of thousands of christians in one area!"
4,To easy here....,"Another incredible book, go figure. I continue to be intrigued by these books and impatiently await the next."
2,One day at a time,I'm thinking the end times will come before the end of this series. One day or two of progression per book is too slow. I thought this was only going to be a series of eight books when they first came out. I enjoy the books so much but it's very disappointing to wait several months for the next book and find out it only takes you a few days farther.
3,Felt More Like Filler Than Thriller,"I began reading this series reluctantly, but was hooked on the first few books. This release, number 9 in the series, left a lot to be desired. The characters seem to be more flat in their development, and I got the impression that the authors were running out of ideas. Many have called the authors the religious Tom Clancy's. I felt that if that was the case, this whole story could have been wrapped up into 3 or maybe 4 books in all.A couple of plot twists kept me reading, but I felt like I was reading it less out of enjoyment and more out of obligation to get through the series. What started out with a lot of excitement and sleepless nights reading all I could has given way to more of ""are we there yet?"" I hope the next book, which is supposed to be the finale is better executed than this edition."
2,Desperation,"Okay, I really enjoyed the first two books, liked the next couple, but now it's just gotten tedious. This book crawls along at a pace that is nearly unbearable. The only thing that kept me reading is the ""friendship"" I've ""developed"" with the characters. The series as a whole has been entertaining and thought-provoking, though."
3,Lost its punch,"I've gone as far with this series as I care to. At this point, I have no more interest in the main characters or plot to continue.I have read another book in this vein entitle, ""The Last Day,"" by Glenn Kleier, and believe that anyone who reads it will be impressed with a truly quality book on this topic. ""The Last Day"" is not a bible tool or some preachy, simplistic fundamentalist claptrap, but a true spiritual and intellectual novel that will challenge your mind and your soul. Read it if you would like a refreshing change of pace from LB.J Klein"
1,drags on,"I love the Left Behind books,but this one is tough for me to pick up. I bought it the day it came out & have to force my self to finish it. I have just finished skimming chapter 16. The days in the book seem to go on forever. Maybe too many people in the story & too much detail. Sorry to say it might be my last"
1,"No offense intended, but.......","I do not have access to PC all of the time and have been waiting to write this. The first books were wonderful and I waited anxiously for the next ones. Man, they need to finish this up!!!I am not a writer but I could finish these up as well as they are doing. There are a lot of ""empty pages"" as far as content to be read.NO PLOT!!! NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!!! ..."
2,"Reading ""Out-Of-Habit"" Now","I have long since stopped having lofty expectations for the books in this series. They're kind of like a ""date movie"" type entertainment now. It's something to do that doesn't require anything of me but to sit down and relax. I'm certain the authors didn't intend on this becoming fluff reading at the beginning, but it sure is now. I wonder how they feel considering that it seems they've seriously reduced themselves and compromised their witness to this point of greed, laziness, and mediocrity. The book is fun -- no great literature, but it's the spirit behind the book that kinda disturbs me; yes, they're still a vehicle for Christ's message, however, it seems to be just an afterthought now. I hope I'm wrong about these guys and their motives, but it seems to me that they've lost their spiritual credibility. I'd like to see them take the advice of so many other reviewers and stop milking the story."
1,Trials & Tribulations of reading DESECRATION,"I received DESECRATION as a Xmas gift from a friend, so I felt obligated to finish it. This book desperately needed an editor who was not afraid to wield his blue pencil on the manuscript. Succinctly, the writing is atrocious. Plot and pacing are nonexistent. The characters are flat and forgettable, the dialog even flatter. If your time is as precious to you as mine is to me, spend it reading something else."
2,Getting boring,"The authors seem to be dragging out this series. Each book is progressively getting long winded and has less adventure and detail. How many books in total are there going to be? If I wasnt hooked on the series, I'd wouldnt waste the time reading it."
1,Let me do you a favor--,"RUN, don't walk from this site. Take your money and buy a REAL novel with REAL substance and story and CHARACTERS. Anything but THE DESECRATION. If you must read an End Times novel, pick up a copy of Glen Kleier's THE LAST DAY--it is easily the best out there, it is profound and it will captivate you. If you're looking for something more spiritual, may I suggest the NEW TESTAMENT. Read ANYTHING but this excruciatingly horrible drek!"
5,Awesome Stuff,"I read this book the day I got it (the release date). Now I am Mad because I have to wait until the summer, for the next one. One wonders if Lahaye and Jenkins plan on getting raptured before the final book comes out so they don't have to try to describe the Glorious Appearing!! Who knows? Oh well, another great edition to a great series."
3,Fair,"This book was probably one of the worst of the left behind series. It is simply too predictable. The Anti christ is very stupid in the book. One of my favorite parts of the other books is the fact that Carpathia was sneaky and devious. In the other books I found it fascinating to read about how one man could manipulate the would to accepting a one world dictatorship. In this book Carpathia seems too obviously evil. Take for example the last line of the book. However, I must give Lahaye and Jenkins credit. It is hard to write about the Tribulation. They have to make events that are already destined to happen into a entertaining novel. Lastly, the left behind movie may have been better made into a TV series. The style of the books are more TVish then movish."
2,Disapointed...,"I'm beginning to think the authors need to get a shot of adrenaline when writing because this book was SOOOOO slow... it was borderline boring, surprisingly predictable, and way too easy to put down.I miss the action and adventure of the first five books, I'm starting to feel like the publishers and/or authors are dragging this out into who-knows-how-many books for purposes of PROFIT more than purposes of advancing what was an exciting and wonderful story...I hope the next book in the series is more satisfying - actually, I hope they have so much happen in the next book that it can be the LAST book, because one thing is for sure: If the next book is as disapointing as this one was, I'm not bothering with the series anymore."
3,Fast-paced,"This particular book in the Left Behind series is constantly moving. I personally didn't find any ""slow"" moments, and I actually could have used some. It was a little more of a choppy read than most of the other books because of the pace. The ending is the usual cliff-hanger style found in the other books in the series, but I find myself more interested in the Greece mission storyline intermission than in the last event where the author left off. But in general, it's a good book, and as is par for the course, I'm ready for #10."
1,Just as bad as bad can be,"After the first 8 books, I have to keep reading just to find out if they can get any worse. And surprise! They can. (...)Bad writing, no characterization, lame plotting, a complete lack of believability (regardless of whether you agree or disagree with the authors interpretation of the Revelation), and continuous resorting to ""deus ex machina"" to get the so-called characters out of their (...) situations.(...)"
1,"Enough, already!","Can these guys milk it, or what? This series is longer than the tribulation, and far more trying! God, give me the strength to endure more of these books! What have I done to deserve this penance?The bad characters and the bad writing are just laughable. It's all so shallow and predictable. Want some deep spiritual fiction? Read Dostoevsky. Grisham looks like Shakespeare compared to these guys. Save your money and quit enriching people like this who prey on the American Christian's prediliction for endtimes paranoia."
5,The Series Picks up Momentum,"This is a great series of books for spiritual and nonspiritual people alike. I felt that the previous two books in the series were slowed down and dragged out, but this book picks up at full speed. As usual, the cliffhanger will leave you clamoring for the next book!"
3,okay,"If you've read all the books leading up to this one, then you'll know exactly what to expect here. I think things could move along a little faster, less hemming and hawing and fewer meaningless details. The amount of action and edge-of-your-seat situations seems to be decreasing with each book, with more focus on the boring in-between stuff. I will say this, though, there's a good cliffhanger ending."
3,Desecration,"I have read all the books in the ""Left Behind"" Series, and I find myself agreeing with the fact that this is probably the worst written of all the books so far. I found it difficult at times to follow who was who, as characters were killed, new ones introduced, and I didn't have a clue as to where they came from. I will read the rest of the series as it comes out, as I own all the rest, and would like to own the whole set. I just hope the rest of the books go back to the way the first few books were written. More concise, and logical."
1,the last book,This will be the last book in this series I will read. The writing is bland. I agree with the one reviewer that these books are becoming painful to read. The character development is minimal and the plots are simplistic and boring.I think the authors are doing a discredit to a great idea by dragging it out way too long. The authors cover in an entire book what a good writer could accomplish in a couple of chapters. It is not like the characters/plot are compelling enough to keep the reader engaged.I will be looking into other apocalyptic fiction and abandoning these books.
2,NOT EVEN IN THE SAME LEAGUE WITH CHRIST CLONE,"Allow me to be blunt. LEFT BEHIND is not even in the same league with the books of THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY! The LEFT BEHIND series jabbers on endlessly about paper-thin characters (I know that's over used, but rarely has it been more appropriate) and barely deals with the events of prophecy. The Antichrist in these books is so unconvincing it's pathetic. The entire story of Desecration is built around the antichrist doing things he simply would not and will not do."
3,Disappointed Again,I loved the first books in the series but they have gotten progressively worse. Maybe it's just not possible for anyone to write so many books in one series and do it well. Jerry Jenkins and Tim Lahaye should end this soon and save their reputations. I think the character of Carpathia is an unbelievable representation of what the anti-christ will be like. I'm getting tired of all his silly antics. We're long over due to see the power of God at work. For a more true-to-life portrayal of end-times events try The Christ Clone Trilogy by James BeauSeigneur. In this trilogy each successive book is better then the one before it. So keep on reading.
2,Frustrated by the short period covered and left hanging.,"Please bear with me while I explain why I give this book such a low rating. I have read the entire series including this book. Don't get me wrong, the books are a quick and enjoyable read. I started the series in the summer of 2001 when there were only 8 books. I finished all 8 in about 6 weeks. But I am frustrated that at this point there may be 15 books to complete the series if they cover the small amount of time this one does. Also, without describing the ending of this book, it leaves you hanging in the middle of an episode. I am hooked and ready for the next book, but it will not be out until next year. My recommendation is to NOT purchase this book now. Wait until the entire series is completed and then buy which books you have not read all at once. That way you will have the entire story and can read it until completion and not be frustrated."
5,These are GREAT books and ...,"These are GREAT books and I can't wait for The Remnant!!! In the meantime, I've been reading The Christ Clone Trilogy by James BeauSeigneur. Definitely a MUST READ while you wait for The Remnant!"
4,I guess I'm hooked but...,"Okay, I'm hooked on this series. I've now read all 9 books of the Left Behind series and I'll definitely read the rest as they come out. There's enough good to keep me going through the dry stuff. I guess I'm just a sucker for a soap opera. I'm hooked on the story of the characters.On the other hand, while I'll keep reading Left Behind, I have to agree with those who say that The Christ Clone Trilogy by James BeauSeigneur is really a better and much more realistic end times series. Besides since The Christ Clone Trilogy is a completed series, you don't have to worry so much that the rapture will come before you finish reading. ;-)"
3,The series is starting to wear thin...,"I was a big fan of the series to date, but I am really starting to feel that we are starting to see the series declining due to the fact that the authors have been required to extend the number of books for the series. I have seen other books that were only a few hundred pages, go into great deal on the end times, with wonderful character development, and they were only a fraction of the size. I must say that Desecration was more entertaining than the last few, but how much longer can they drag it out?"
2,One flew over the cookoos nest,"Jesus said the resurrection is on the last day, not before the tribulation. The rapture occurs before the tribulation, not the resurrection. The made in the shade escape is against the gospel of Christ. The saints who are persecuted in Revelation and Daniel are the saints that remain, not natural Jews who are not converted. Jesus taught his disciples to pray to be accounted worthy to escape the tribulation, not to take it for granted."
4,DESECRATION,"ANOTHER BOOK FROM THE LEFT BEHIND SERIES.. WELL WRITTEN ACCOUNT OF THE BOOK OF REVELATIONS PUTTING IT INTO TERMS WITH BELIEVEABLE PEOPLE AND SITUATIONS THAT MODERN FOLKS CAN IDENTIFY WITH. ONE OF THE BEST EXPLAINATIONS OF THIS PART OF THE BIBLE I HAVE EVER SEEN.. WELL WORTH THE READ, BUT ONE NEEDS TO READ ALL OF THEM IN ORDER. WHILE THESE BOOKS CAN ""STAND ALONE"".. THEY ARE BEST READ IN SEQUENCE."
5,Satan is on the loose....,"Satan sure isn't wasting much time now that he has inhabited Nicolae Carpathia's body. No longer even pretending to be a pacifist, every Moral Monitor is now armed and prepared to kill anyone who refuses to accept the mark of the beast.""Desecration"" is the 9th book in the ""Left Behind"" series. The book opens with Rayford Steele and the other Tribulation Force members preparing to evacuate the Jewish believers to Petra and ends with a cliffhanger that will make you want to scream. In between, we see the death of several more Trib (and semi-Trib) members, the coming of age (so to speak) of Dr. Chaim Rosenzweig, the revealing of the safe house in Chicago, and Tsion Ben-Judah arriving in Petra.As with most of the other books, the action is fast paced and the characters will draw you in. Once you pick up this book, you will not want to put it down."
1,I'd give it a (minus) 5 star if I could,Another bad book based on bad theology. I wish I could give a minus rating to all of these author's books. Just say no.
2,Time to Finish,"The Left Behind series started out with such promise. I rated the first book a 5 and I am afraid the last book will be a 1. The drawn out story lines and repetition from previous books, which is not necessary due to the loyalty of the readers, has taken the excitement out of the story. Lahaye and Jenkins have apparently succumed to the power of the Anti-Christ and decided making as much money as possible on this series is more important than tell the story.The Anti-Christ appears to have gotten dumber and less powerfull in every book. Why can he control the thoughts of people, but not read them? Reasonability has left the story line and the reader is left laughing instead of being amazed or inspired.I am looking forward to a break in the series. Maybe I will forget how bad it has gotten."
3,disappointing desecration,"I am a hard core Left Behind fan, had the web page, screen saver, movie, CD's books and all- until then. I stopped reading when they killed David Hassid. He was one of the few belivable characters and by far the smartest. But thoughout the book they started doing dumb things and it was as if someone else wrote the book, not Tim Lahaye or Jerry B. Jenkins. I put my name on the ""be first to get it List at my christian book store. Now I am not so sure any more. Come on guys you are so much better, I don't want the next one to be left behind on my book shelf."
3,Romanian Anti-Christ?,"i haven't read the series yet and probably won't given that i now know that the anti-christ happens to be romanian. i too am romanian, born in the carpathian mountains and my middle name is nicolae. i'm sure the authors didn't mean that the actual anti-christ, when he does make himself known will be from romania, but just want all the readers out there to know that there are some good nicolaes born in the carpathian mountains in romania. that's all i have to say about that. enjoy reading the books though."
1,Desecration of writing ethics,"Authors are SUPPOSED to take care of their readers...give them what they shelled out hard earned cash to get...ENTERTAINMENT. This installment is a prime example of exploiting a good idea for cash.For a good end times novel, try Stephen King's ""The Stand."" If that's too secular for you, try new novelist Christine Hilger's ""A Force of Habit"" She is a crafted storyteller who will take you on an adventure where good and evil battle with beautiful prose, and take the time to surprise you with the ending."
1,Is it over YET?,"What started off as a promising series has turned into a ploy by the writers and publisher to make more money for themselves by dragging the story out. The writing has gotten very thin. I can't believe the reading level could be more than 8th grade. I can't even remember what grabbed my attention to these books. The story line now is so unrealistic I can't stand to read another one, which is too bad because I think there could be a message in the story - but it was lost long about the 4th book. This book takes place at the 3 1/2 year mark - but it seems like the last 3 or 4 have done the same. It is moving very s - l - o - w - l - y. At the rate they are going, it's going to take another 10 or so books to complete the tribulation."
2,No longer an advocate,"I'm fed up with the blatant attempt to milk the market for every dollar this story can wring. It's plain wrong to use a spiritual subject like this to reap gratuitous award, and I refuse to be exploited further. In the midst of all these books, I read a great novel recommended by the author Clive Cussler, which I will pass on to anyone interested in the topic of Judgment Day. The book is ""The Last Day"" by G. Kleier, and it is a very moving, scary, intelligent look at the World in the throes of a Second Coming. What you will like about this book is that it is ONE, completely contained story -- not a trick to stretch you and your wallet out over multiple books. And in reading it, you will find far more to think about and marvel over than any these other so-called ""Judgment Day"" novels, which may follow the Book of Revelation better, but lack ""The Last Day's"" spiritual power and surprises. I'm leaving ""Left Behind"" behind, and anyone who is tired of being duped should do the same!"
1,Desecration,I agree with several other reviewers...boring!!I started the Left Behind series late and read the 1st 4 books in a week. They were interesting; I cared about the characters. Now it seems as if the author is burdened and JUST wants to finish the series. The writing is elementary. This 390 page book is actually about 200 pages if the print were smaller and the typeset filled the page!! I agree with another reviewer who said get the book from the library or borrow it. Don't waste your money. Does the author truely want to help believers?? Write a decent book!!
1,"Great Idea, Bad writing","Like many others I became totally fascinated and hooked into the series because it simplifies the prophecies of the end times in a storyteller fashion. However, about half way through the series I began to get annoyed with the sloppy writing, but continued on until I started reading Desecration. There is no excuse for educated people to write a book as poorly as this. I could not keep up with the pages and pages of unnecessary dialogue and finally just put it down. Well I know the outcome of the story anyway! The series is a great idea. I just wish the authors could have told the story in fewer books and with some sense of literary merit."
2,could'nt get past the narration!,"It seemed like an intruiging enough book, and I'm sure I would enjoy reading it myself, but the narrator on this audio version is awful! It says he is some award winning narrator, but I can't imagine! He dramtically 'whispers' the last word of almost EVERY sentence! He sounds like William Shatner or something. Waay too much 'drama' in his voice to allow the listener to be pulled into the story. I couldn't get past his silly voice! I gave up after the first chapter. (no offense to the guy, sorry)"
3,"Thrilling story, but writing leaves much to be desired","I've been hooked on the Left Behind series since the first novel in the series was published because the story is great and I believe the basic events are theologically close to what may actually occur in the future. However, every time a new book in the series is released, I'm always faced with the dilemma of really wanting to find out what happens next mixed with the feeling that I'm wasting money on a poorly written book. The characters are never really developed, and events lack the description to make them come alive. Sadly, this seems to be true of much of Christian fiction, published mainly because it's Christian and not because it's good. I believe I may try the Christ Clone Trilogy that many reviewers here have mentioned."
2,It's like they're not even trying anymore,"I have read every book in the series, and this, by far, was the worst of the bunch (I sensed it was going downhill with the previous book.) The authors seem to have forgotten how to tell a story, let alone make it interesting (Ghost Writers anyone?). The grammar and style are targeted for a very young audience, and because of this, the book belongs in the Young Adult section of your local bookstore. The plot is interesting for a few pages here and there, but overall, there are probably ten worthwhile pages. The filler between plot points comes across as if it was written between tee times at the local golf course. I rarely read a book I don't like, but I felt compelled to write about my experience. The book deserves less than two stars, but since the overall series is rewarding and interesting (and I will see it through the end,) I gave it a higher score..."
5,The Left Begind Series,The Left Behind Series. The series captures the interest of the reader with each turn of a page. Highly recommend to avid readers.
3,Desecration,"I started reading the Left Behind series in December 2011, and have read the first eleven books in the series. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the books so far but I must admit that I found Desecration to be a bit of a slow read compared to the previous books in the series. I will read the remaining books in the series and I will recommend them to others who are interested in reading about the end times."
4,Give it a chance...,"Although I was a bit burned out on the series, I just couldn't read the first eight books and not continue on with this one. I imagine most other Left Behind readers feel similarly. While I do wish the authors would cover more ground per book (and some parts get a little boring), for the most part I found myself as engrossed in Desecration as in any of the other series' books.The authors never claim their work to be anything other than their inpretation of Revelation in a fiction format. Whether or not the reader agrees with every detail's Biblical parallel, the book succeeds in getting us to think and study and hopefully discover God's Word for ourselves."
4,Anxious for the next!,"I love these books...I will agree that the first one was kind of slow but the rest are great. I can't wait until I can read the next. It amazes me how all the people that have gave bad reviews as far back at the begining series have read this far to give it a bad review. STOP reading them, its as simple as that. Bet they continue to read the series. I know I'm hooked. I stay up as late as possible because I don't want to put these books down."
2,I'll still be alive.,"book number 1(1995)...number 2 (1996)..number 3 (1997)...number 4 (1998)..number 5 (1999) ..number 6 (2000) number 7 and 8(2001) and, finally, number 9 (2002)...Oh! (...) number 10(2003) number 11(2004)..number 12 (2005)...number 13 (2006)..number 14 (2007)..e finally again..number 15 (2008)...I'm beginning to read a book with 35 years old...and will finish it with 48 years old....and...(...)...sorry! Amazon,please, send me a e-mail in 2008 or 2009 and remember me about these books..ok?Maybe I'll still be alive."
2,Dragging....,I'm a huge fan of this series. I read the first 8 books in record time and could hardly wait for this one. This turned out to be a huge disappointment. This entire 'book' could have been done in one chapter. End this....please!!
5,Desecration,FABULOUS!! Each book builds on the last and gets more exciting. This book reveals more and more of the antichrist and his agenda. A must read!! I can't wait for the next one!
3,"Interesting read, but...","I think I have to agree with most of the people that are reading this series: TOO MUCH TIME IN-BETWEEN BOOKS!!! It seems that the series is starting to slow down, a number of days take place in Book 9, while in eariler books time seemed to speed along. Maybe it is the authors' finally getting their rythm. Otherwise, it is a great series. The characters are not one dimemtional, they have depth and feelings. I look forward to the next book and the graphinc novel later this year."
4,Apples and Oranges,"Saying that a book isn't good because it disagrees with your theology is like saying a tomato isn't a grape. The series shows an indepth look at life in a horrible situation and how people might react. This series IS reaching the lost and is still on the Best Seller lists. One might ask if the ""Alternative"" is on the same list......hmmmmmm?"
3,Left Behind Series is getting thin,"I've been reading the left behind series by a fluke, let me explain I borrowed my brother's first installment (Left behind) and I was shocked, I wanted to keep reading about the prophecys and antichrist I read through the first six books like a brush fire, it was the first time that a book had captivated me so much and I bought them all (1-8 at that time) it started to get a little boring, don't get me wrong I still want to know what happens in the end, but I think that the authors should ""spice up"" the remaining books just a little more. I'm going to keep reading because I like the plot, but please make it a little more fun"
3,Desecration: Antichrist Takes the Throne (Left Behind #9),Probably the worst in the series...The majority of the book seemed to be just filler information...and not very interesting. I think the authors must have rushed through this one just to have it on the shelves in time...
1,I wanted to like this one.,"I really tried to like it. But I didn't. I found it boring, cliche, predictable...not like some of the others in the series. I had to force myself to finish, though I must admit the second half was much better than the first. I am a Christian, and I think this series started out with a wonderful message. Now I think they're just cashing in. I'd be willing to wait for longer periods of time between books if they were better quality. These books are starting to read like Danielle Steel!!"
3,PART OF THE LEFT BEHIND SERIES,"This is one of the later books in the Left Behind Series. Similar to all the others. Fortunately is a story in itself, so if you don't get the whole series you can still get a good read."
4,The Worst Is Yet to Come,"'Desecration,' book #9 of the 'Left Behind series' the AntiChrist takes the Throne. Nicolae Carpathia now raised from the dead to be the new AntiChrist. Nicolae commits his most heinous, diabolical act: the desecration of the Holy Temple. He claims the Throne as Lord of the Earth. As predicted in the book of Daniel ch. 9. The Tribulation Force (Rayford, Buck, Bruce and Chloe) and the world face the worse and prepare to do battle against the evil AntiChrist."
2,Lover of the Left Behind series,I thought this book was one of the best I think as the books go on they get better and better. I have read all the books in the series in less then 6 months and I can't put them down. I can't wait until the 10 book comes out until then I have to find other books to read. But I recomend this book to anyone who believes in God. The books shows I think how life is going to be and shows us that we should change or ways before Jesus does come back that way if you do believe in him with all your heart you do not have to worry about the comming of crist. I give this book two thumbs up just like all the rest of his books.
1,Disappointing,It seems that either this book was either rushed or the authors just need to fill in the spaces. After reading all of the others and telling my friends about it I find my self embarrassed that I did so. Even the ending seemed like a weak attempt at (...) me back in for the sequel. I won't belive that the main reason this edition was written was for the money.
3,They stopped in the middle of the first act,I enjoyed the book. I have read all of them. I do think the authors need to write a complete novel. By using wide margins and 1-1/2 spacing between lines a 400 page novel becomes a rather small paperback. We look forward to this story and then at the very end the authors leave us hanging with unfinished ends all over the place. I have decided not to buy anymore. I will wait until they come to the library and after they have written several more I will read 2 at a time to get a more complete story. I feel like we are reading a weekly comic strip but there is 6 months between segments.
1,What a cop-out,"I enjoyed the first books of this series and was impressed by how well the story progressed. Great literature? No! But at least they were interesting and tried to have a message.This book is by far the worst of the series, and may turn me off on the rest of the series altogether. It feels like the authors are selling out to try and accommodate a bigger audience. It has a low-budget, movie-of-the-week feel. They authors keep trying to throw one big event after another without giving us a chance to know and care about the characters. The characters are just action figures and have lost all trace of the personalities we bought into in the earlier books.And the ending was a ridiculous insertion of a TV season-finale cliffhanger, trying to rope the audience into tuning in for the next installment. If the authors were still as focused on their message instead of their ranking on the best seller list, they wouldn't have to resort to such tricks in the ninth book of a series."
3,The problem is...,I started reading the Left Behind series because it was supposed to be about the end times and show how prophecy might play out. The problem is that Jerry Jenkins has filled the books with so much extraneous story that has nothing to do with the end times that the books read more like a soap opera than an end times series. I agree with those who have found the Christ Clone Trilogy by James BeauSeigneur to be a much more satisfying end times series.
2,5 more books left..,"I recieved this book as a gift the day it came out. I didn't start reading it until months later. two days ago in fact.. and I have 70 pages left, so you may think this review immature. Frankly, I find this series boring, and each book a re-hash of the same plot over and over.. someone in the Force is killed, and new characters are introduced, while Carpathia advances in the stages of biblical prophesy. Theologically, and realistically, this series is so unbelievable. Honestly, When I read this, I can't imagine HOW, especially when talking about the community and their gullibility, and the acts of Carpathia. The writing style seems poor and descriptions are shallow. I am tired of this series, yet of course will finish it.. but not necessarily by my own will. I have read from MANY that the Christ Clone Trilogy is far better theologically, militaristically, politically, and technologically."
2,Disappointing,"I've never reviewed a book on Amazon, but since I've enthusiastically read every store in this series I just had to add my two cents. The first six books were read in one or two sittings, at the detriment of my daily activities. Books 7 and 8 were read in 3-4 sittings, and this book was read over the span of a week or so. I hope the trend is reversed with the next book. Desecration wasn't very gripping and only spanned a few days. Carpathia is now a comic book character. The lack of sophistication and subtlety with his character development is very disappointing.I'm hopeful the authors will resist pressure to put out the next book in six months if it continues to diminish the quality of the writing, plot and character development."
3,"Not a great series, but good","I've just finished book nine from the series, Desecration and find myself agreeing with many other reviewers. This is a good series, but not great. The characters never really come alive and the plot definitly seems to begin slowing down in order to strech it out to cover more books. Still, these novels are simple, easy reads and go into some pretty good depth when it comes to the particulars of Revelations. I could see this series as being very good for teen-agers, although as an adult, they aren't as challenging as they could be. If you're looking for greatness, I agree with many others that We All Fall Down by Caldwell and The Christ Clone Trilogy by BeauSeigneur are still the best of the genre- intellegent, well written, and very powerful."
2,Desecration - Huge Fan becomes Disappointed,"Number 9 - ""Desecration"" was disappointing. I am a huge Left Behind fan and preordered this book back in July. I devour the books in about a day, but I was very disappointed in this book. Simply, this book lacked substance and I think the authors are trying to stretch the series too thin. In a nutshell, the front cover and the back cover say it all.I will give the next book a try and hopefully it will refuel my interest - if not, I am done."
2,This is Dry Reading,"This is not a book for Generation X or Y. It is very dry reading. There are some good points in this book, but overall, it was not appealing to me. Write the vision and make it plain so that all can understand."
2,Questionable Quality,We bought this for our son's 10th birthday- it lasted a whole 21 hours before it fell over from playing with it. Basically that means we put the marbles on it and they rolled down. The tracks then fell apart. Joy.
4,interesting resource,A little complex to use but once you get into it it can be fun. Set up like a dictionary so you need to thumb through it. Interesting resource though
5,"What a great ""candle light:"" album.","I love this album. I am not a softie looking for romantic stuff, but when I listened to this album, reluctantly, my heart was moved.First I fell under the spell of ""Sorry is the Saddest Word"", the original arrangement and key changes turned this into such an emotional song, I felt the heart break, and the hope.My second favorite is at the end of the album, ""Broken Wings"", another song that might be heartbreak but somehow conveys hope. It is sung in such an original way with a New Age feel to it.Going back and listening again, songs that I wondered about at first started creeping in, I kept hearing new artistry that I missed the first time.Well, I guess you can see that I recommend this album, so I will let you draw your own conclusions from listening. Just one note, once is NOT enough."
2,Mixed emotion,"I loved Clay's first CD and have been anxiously awaiting this CD. I admit his voice sounds better than ever but do agree the choice of songs are very poor. There are some wonderful moments with ""Everything I have"" and ""Lonely No more"" but I am disappoited with the 'lounge act' assortment of cover songs. Perhaps due to my age, I have heard these songs so many times that I am sick of them already. I haven't given up on Clay and still think he is truely talented."
5,WOW what a voice!,"A butter and honey voice like no other on the planet sings favorites from the '80's. The most awesome rendition of ""Broken Wings"" I've ever heard; if you think you don't like this song...think again once you've heard this! ""Lonely no More"" is a new love song from Clay that will break your heart...and ""Everything I Have"" will heal it.Grab it!!"
5,Sensational !!!,"Don't listen to that negative review below. That person is just jealous, and I bet that person hasn't or didn't even listen to the full CD with an open mind. This CD is definitely worthy of winning tons of Grammy Awards and all kinds of awards. It is that good. Clay Aiken sings these great songs a whole lot better than the originals, especially the song ""Right Here Waiting."" Clay Aiken definitely now owns these songs; he made the songs his own and sings his heart out. My favorite songs on the CD are: ""Without You"" and ""A Thousand Days."" Clay Aiken has an amazing, glorious, emotional voice that gives me chills and is so heartfelt and enjoyable to hear. Please buy this CD. This music CD is the best and is the greatest CD of the year."
2,way too soon to be doing cover songs like this,"Clay Aiken is a stylist&has a decent enough voice to work extremely well in Adult contempary radio. most of the material that he covers here is geared directly to that format,but it's the four original songs that if Clay ever truly has a chance at a solo career is where he has to go to fully reach that point. dude ain't been out that long to be having ten cover songs&this shows me more of the record company being afraid to let him wander&find his creative edge for a few projects, than a Artist begging to be a cover Act. ""broken Wings""&Right here waiting for you"" suit his range really well,but we stil don't know what type of artist he truly is. the arrangements fit his voice,but then again it's basically off a standard format which still doesn't say anything about Clay Aiken."
1,WHAT!!!!!!!!!!,"Are you kidding me. You call this guy an artist. No wonder he didnt win american idol, hes a friggen cover boy. Are you telling me that he couldnt come up with new songs he had to butcher a bunch of old ones. Ok he didnt really butcher them but trying to cover bryan adams is hard as hell and im sorry clay you didnt do his justice. This is one cd that i gave away willingly."
4,good but not great,"i love clay aiken even though i'm not a claymate - i liked this album, but i wasn't blown away. he's playing it so safe on this album and not using the magic that his voice had on idol. he also doesn't seem to have the emotions behind the music - these are some serious heart break songs! his cover of air supply's ""i can't live"" was bland - i'm not a big fan of air supply but when they did the song, you could hear the heart break. his best songs on the album are the one's he wrote and ""broken wings"" where you finally get some power and emotion out of him. don't get me wrong, the songs aren't bad, they are good but just not great! i think he's capable of great..."
2,Tracey,"I did not know this was all remake-s, the songs were too outdated and not really done that different to enjoy them"
3,Waiting for the next one -,"Love to listen to Clay sing but the song selection on this one is not that strong, so therefore, he doesn't sound as good as he should. Looking forward to the next one to be a lot stronger!"
3,Maybe I'm just not a claymate,I like Clays voice. However this album is a bit dull...and very much what you'd expect from an American Idol alum. I guess I was hoping for something unexpected.
1,BORING,"I am very disappointed in this CD. It's just plain boring. Nothing standouts. It'll make good elevator music. Let's hope the next one is better or he'll become the next ""whatever happened to""."
2,Boring at best!!,"I really like Clay Akin and love his voice. However, this cd was too much of a good thing. All of the songs sounded alike. He needed some vaiation of songs. Boring...... Sorry Clay"
2,Clay Aiken New CD a Bust,"This has to be one of the worse CD's I have listened to in a long time. sad, too as his first CD, Measure of a Man was awesome!This CD is just a cover of songs done by other singers. Clay's singing is that of an ameture and we all know he can sing much better than that. To me, this CD was not only was a disappointment, but a definite waste of one's hard earned cash.I hope Clay's next CD, if there is one, is something original and more inspiring. Let's hope so. If not, his singing career may come to a screeching hault!"
2,Meh?,"Well, what can you say? It's a bland collection of power ballads from the '80s with 4 original pop-lite songs.You can tell that Clay loves glory notes since there's plenty of them to be had on this CD. I personally don't like the breathiness and lack of emotion in his voice but he is a capable singer.The uninspired arrangements (ie. Without You) and moments of hoakiness (the spoken word inserted on Broken Wings) made me long to hear superior versions by the original artists instead. This effort will probably not convert any new fans.2 stars -- you'll see lots of copies at the used cd store in a few months."
2,Fans can never be objective...,"C'mon people! Are the songs ""nice?"" Yes of course...but you wait 2 years for a new CD with a bunch of very well known old songs!? Nothing different from the original and a great voice can only take you so far. If you want to be respected as an artist and not just ""a great voice from a TV talent show,"" then stop the rehash and be original. You'll forget this in a year."
5,The Man can sing!,"Anyone who is in Love, has been in Love, longs for Love, or has had Love and lost will find a song to relate to on this CD. ""A Thousand Days"", ""Sorry seems to be the Hardest word"", ""Here you come again"" (go figure!), and ""Broken Wings"" stand out for me.An interesting twist to ""I want to Know what Love is"" - originally sung in a single 'voice' I always thought it a song of longing... but here, done as a duet, it becomes an anthem for new lovers."
5,WOW - Best Album should get grammy,"This album is great. he has risen to grammy material. Buy this album, you'll love it."
2,Needed to replace CD stuck in car player,"Sorry, not a favorite of mine after hearing it on loan from our library. Sadly the car cd player broke and it was ruined as the mechanics tried to get it out. Not to fear, found nicely priced replacement on Amazon site. Thanks Amazon, but No Thanks Clay!"
3,Disappointed in RCA.......,I loved Clay Aiken since his first audition with AI. The songs recorded here are some of my favorites and Clay's vocals are great but the sorry orchestra drowns out most of his voice and the quality of this RCA production is terrible! It seems to me that RCA cut corners and assigned the cheapest orchestra they could find and the recording quality is really sorry! I am so disappointed that RCA couldn't produce a better product as they afford other vocalists.
5,Even better!,"I just purchased this album. I love it. Great songs, by a great singer. But, what I find most interesting is the number of reviews on the web site. Proves Clay still has that magic."
5,A Thousand Different Accolades,"Hands down Clay Aiken has the best voice in this genre.. I don't listen to much ""pop"" music now because it all sounds alike- I can't tell one singer from another; however Clay Aiken stands out from the crowd- he simply is the best. I don't buy many CD's- but I will say that I have all of Clay's -I like this CD for so many reasons- the songs - the arrangements- and of course the Voice, I don't know how he does it but his singing is exciting & soothing at the same time. I know I will be listening to this CD more than a Thousand times.. thanks Clay if I could I would give this CD a million stars."
5,A Thousand Different Ways - Wonderful album,What a great album. Clay has used his interpretations of some standard love songs to tug at your heart. His voice is an orchestral instrument at times. So much thought has been put into this album's production and Clay's emotional translations fits this idea perfectly.
5,I am so glad I purchased this CD,"I love Clay's voice, what a great performer he is. I am never disappointed. I hated for the song ""Here You Come Again"" to end. I am hoping this CD is so popular that it is re-released with more songs on it. Wonderful arrangements of beautiful songs."
5,Holey moley!,I love this CD!!!! I think Clay's voice shows a maturity and a smoothness that was not as apparent on MOAM. I think he brings a freshness to each of the cover songs and sings them with emotion and attention to each nuance!!! Lonely No More is awesome!!! Broken Wings...ethereal. Here You Come Again - Dolly Parton should be proud Clay Aiken is singing her song!!!Beautifully crafted CD.
5,A Thousand Different Ways,"I love clay changed the texture of his voice is so many of the songs on this CD. He sounds so different on each song. I especially love the song he co-wrote, ""Lonely No More"", and his other originals. I never cared for ""Here You Come Again"" and what he has done with the arrangement is just sublime.His voice is showcased beautifully on this CD and I highly recommend it."
2,Disappointing effort from a guy with a great voice,"I loved Clay's first CD, so I didn't hesitate to buy this one as soon as it came out. I held back in saying anything about it, figuring it would take time to grow on me, but it still hasn't happened. This CD is amazingly dull. Even the songs I do like (""A Thousand Days"" and ""Everytime You Go Away"") never rise above pleasant. I'm more than willing to give the man another chance in a couple years when he decides to come out with a new CD, but until then I will remain a disappointed Clay Aiken fan."
2,This is supposed to be five stars but wont let me change AWESOME CD,"I have been anxiously awaiting this cd. His voice is beautiful and I constantly have a smile on my face while listening to him. It gives me chills. There is just no one out that there has the same effect on me. I truly hope to hear some of these songs on the radio. The new songs are great especially ""A Thousand Days"". There is also a song co-written by Clay that is not on this cd but you can download called ""Lover All Alone"". Clay not only has the singing down but it sounds as if he is a great songwriter as well. I am hoping the next cd will be all new songs possibly all written or co-written by him. That would make it even more special. He is an amazing vocalist, entertainer and does so much for children with special needs such as autism and does a great job as a Unisef ambassador. Thank you Clay!"
3,"Less-than-stellar, but still better than most of the dreck out there.","There is no denying Clay's talent and the raw emotion in his voice is once again evident. There is simply something lacking here and beyond the fact that some of the song choices themselves miss the mark, it's actually difficult to pinpoint. As mentioned by other reviewers, the original songs are good, and maybe that's the problem. The cover-to-original ratio should be reversed, and then maybe everyone would be giving 5-star reviews. As it is, this is still an enjoyable listen...just not up to par with Measure of a Man. Hopefully the next album will make us forget this, well rather forgettable offering."
2,Cover album? Bad idea.,"I love Clay Aiken's voice - it's just beautiful. However, I do NOT love these songs! I couldn't stand most of them the first time around and am baffled why anyone thinks we need to hear them again. These are just such lame songs to cover.I'm still a fan, but not of this album. Next time out, I'd like an album of originals. And could we make it a little upbeat, please?"
1,YUCK!,"I ended up giving this CD away. As hard as I tried, I just couldn't get into it. This album is terrible! Clay can do so much better than this. He should have left these great songs to the originators. Sorry Clay... you didn't even come close to doing them justice."
3,Still A Clay Fan,"This CD is well produced, and Clay sounds great, but I don't understand why they decided to go in this direction. A CD of mostly (ordinary) covers doesn't make for a great second CD.The strongest songs on this CD are the four originals, and it is hard to believe they couldn't have found more to include (and add a few covers if desired). In fact, the best song, by far, isn't even on the actual CD! ""Lover All Alone"" is available only on I-Tunes which, again, doesn't make sense. It is written by Clay and is absolutely beautiful. It should have been prominently positioned on this CD.I am still a huge fan of Clay, and will buy his CDs in the future. As far as this CD, though, it could have been better."
2,Pretty voice,"I love Clay's voice, and he sounds great on some of these cover songs. Some of them he sounds hmmmm... I think he would have done better to have his second easy listening cd or pop to be originals. As a new artist he needed to define himself as a force to be reckoned with, not someone who has been out for say, 20 years and could pull off a cover cd. I give it a 2."
2,Three years for this?,"Three years have passed since the debut from Clay. What a great CD that was. It was the followed by an album of Christmas tunes. Very nice, but not something I like hearing in August. Finally! A new album from Clay. But what the heck, it's all covers! You're kidding right? THREE years and we get a pile of cover tunes? Come on Clay. You're a big talent, don't be wasting it churning out remolded cover tunes. You have done well with them, but I know all the tunes and won't be playing them over and over. You need an album of originals, with maybe a cover tune thrown it. Talent =10, Originality=5.I can see it now, November 2009 and Clay's next album will be a greatest hits collection of all the covers from this, covers from the Christmas album, and maybe one or two originals from the debut album. Honestly I like Clay alot, but he won't last long making people wait three years and still not do anything orginal. Big disappointment."
3,He Can Sing...But,"Wow, where to begin! I am a Clay Aiken fan. Have been since the very beginning. See him when I can in concert and buy multiples of his products. Just like I did this cd. Clay has the voice of an angel, there is no doubt about that, but this cd is boring. There are 3 songs I love: the 6th cut, When I see You Smile and the 7th cut, A Thousand Days. Both these songs are very good and I think Clay should have stayed with new material instead of rehashing covers that were boring to begin with. I love you Clay and you can sing, but this cd is not my cup of tea. Sorry."
3,MARGINAL,I probably bought into the hype. I like Clay Aiken's rendition of the various tracks OK enough and play the CD from time to time. But I soon realized that his talent was quite average. There was little to differentiate him from other mainstream artists.
3,A Little Bolf,"I enjoy Clay's voice a great deal and was ecstatic to see a new album was coming out. I give the album a 3/5 because as the critic says, his voice shines on this record. The big disappointment comes from the fact he took so long between records only to do covers. The new material is overshadowed somewhat by the fact that there aren't one or two or three covers but10...not to mention, and this is where my own personal bias really shows a HORRIBLE cover of a song made famous by (and suited for) Celine Dion...bold and stupid move there Clay...I haven't lost faith in you yet, best of luck on the next release..let's hope it isnt so long in the making and stay away from so many covers, you WERE on Idol ONCE already ;)"
4,Pretty good,"I really enjoyed Clay's first album...every single song. This one is good, but I would have preferred more original songs instead of mostly retreads. I think a 2nd album for an artist should not be re-makes, so although I liked it, I was a bit disappointed."
4,different strokes for different folks,"It has been a joy following Clay Aiken's career. He has inspired many folks of all ages. A good role model is hard to find in the music industry these days which makes Clay a breath of fresh air to many. We will love him, support him and care for him because of who he is, not just what he does. It is an imperfect World and if Clay sings some songs that not everybody likes, so be it - you can not please everyone and Clay isn't trying to. He loves to sing, and if it works for him - that is good - if it doesn't - then it just doesn't - and that is good for Clay too. It is his Faith that has his fans so completely devoted."
5,Beautiful Masterpiece,Clay sings beautiful love songs like no other. His voice is sultry and pure raw emotion. I can't get enough. Thank you Clay for this masterpiece!
5,Soothing the soul with song,"Clay Aiken's new CD is martini for the soul. Classics are unearthed and reproduced with finesse that makes you wonder whether the remake is actually better than the original. My favorites are Dolly Parton's 'Here We Go Again', and 'Everything I Do'. An interesting reviting beat pulls me in on 'A Thousand Days', and Aiken sells this with passion that cannot be denied.The production is excellent - not overpowering - so I hear his voice and articulation. Fantastic job on this CD, worth my time and repeat performances. A must have."
4,Great pop album!,"Clay Aiken's 2006 album is great on many counts. I like how he sings on all the numbers. He did a surprising number of remakes of '80s and '90s hits. But I love Everytime You Go Away the most. Even his newer songs like These Open Arms and Lonely No More are nice. But wow, how Clay likes those big, bombastic endings at most of the songs closings! He has such an over the top approach to these power ballads with how the drums and orchestras scream so loud at the final verse! That's what keeps him a little different from some other current pop male artists. I hope that his next album is a success."
5,Everybody will find something they LOVE!,"Clay is back and he gives us a wonderful record of his voice! Everybody should find something they like to listen too. If you like Soft Rock this CD has, if you want ballads this CD has it, if you want GREAT covers this CD has it and if you want GREAT original music yes this CD has it!My favorites are tracks 2, 3, 10, and 11 WOW!Honorable mentions tracks are track 7 and 14 =)Overall Amazing record and Clay I'm glad your back."
5,A Thousand Different Ways,"I am really enjoying this CD. Although some raised eyebrows at the thought of him doing a covers CD, I have known now for over 3 years that he is able to take a good song and make it great, a great song and make it greater. That is just what he did with this CD. His new songs are excellent, too. I particularly love ""Everything I Have"" and ""Lonely No More."" I already liked ""A Thousand Days"" from hearing it at his Juke Box Tour. The recording is better than it was on tour because of the musical arrangements. And, I also like the way he does ""These Open Arms."" So, for me, this is a great Clay CD. I will really be looking forward to attending his Valentine's Concert this year with songs from this CD as well as those additional songs that can be found as digital downloads.Clay's voice is smooth as silk in these songs, and the orchestrations are beautiful. If you love his voice, give this CD a real chance. He shines through on it and the songs set such a romantic mood."
5,The best album so far...,I just love it especially the Thousand different ways song.I'm a mother of two boys and I've been big fan of him since he had his audition for AI.And for Diane Sawyer and other journalist...please leave him alone.His personal life is none of your business so... BACK OFF !!!!!He made a very beautiful music and that's the most important thing.You go Clay...
5,FINALLY!!!!!,"Clay Aiken's CD is incredible! I love it so much. Songs you really should look out for are Right Here Waiting, Lonely No More, A Thousand Days, I Want Know What Love Is, and These Open Arms. My advice to you is buy this CD now!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Worth Buying,I wasn't too sure about this CD but I'm glad I bought it. It is not one of my favorite CD's but I do enjoy listening to it from time to time. Some of the songs it is hard to hear him. His power voice don't show through on all of them. If you like Clay then you will like this CD.
5,Great music with a modern feel,What I love about this CD is that it is beautiful music with a glorious voice.
5,A Thousand Different Ways,I am so glad somebody recommended this CD of Clay Aiken's. What a beautiful voice. The songs were arranged and sung by the best voice I've heard it a long time. I recommend this CD at 5 STARS!
3,Disappointed,I was disappointed in this CD. Since this was Clay's 2nd release and there was more time to devote to songs I think it missed the mark. The powers that be need to let Clay diversify the songs he records. Everything just sound the same. When he was on tour with Kelly Clarkson he did some really great songs but nothing like them showed up on the CD.Sure hope the next one is better or this fan will stop buying.
3,Not as good as the first!!!,"I was some what disappointed with this CD. Clay has a wonderful voice, but so many of the songs were very bland. I can still listen to him sing anything, but hopefully his next CD will be better."
4,Very Good Sophomore CD,"Though a few of the songs are a little unvaried (you hope to hear a musical peak, and it never quite gets there), ""A Thousand Different Ways"" is definitely worth owning. ""Without You"" & ""Here You Come Again"" are excellent, and ""Everything I Have"" is a beautiful heart melter.Clay does so well in front of an audience that maybe his producer could put an audience behind glass while recording his next CD to spark the intensity and more supported soft sound that come so naturally in his live performances but aren't there quite yet in his recorded performances."
4,i liked it a lot,Clay has such a nice voice and I knew all of the songs. I like to hear my favorite voices sing songs that I know.I would have given this CD 5 stars except I think it is still not the best that he can do. I want to hear him 'get down' into a song instead of having a controlled (if beautiful) voice. I don't know if its emotion that I am looking for or just to see him push himself to the limit.
5,well worth the wait,"i admit that i consider myself a true clay aiken fan and therefore my review is more than slightly biased. this recording was WELL worth the wait. his voice is superb and his takes on each of the covers is refreshing. i especially love ""a thousand days"" and the other originals. this cd will keep me going until the next. it only reinforces my belief he was robbed on american idol."
5,"fantastic voice,","If you are a lover of great vocals you will love this cd, it is a feast for the ears. I'm not sure if the idea to use so many covers was that great, but the glory of this man's voice cannot be denied, I love the way he uses his breath control to an advantage on this album, Wow.... I really enjoyed what he did on this cd."
2,very disappointed!,"I am a HUGE Clay Aiken fan, but I am very sad to say this album is a flop! I was very disappointed with it. It does not compare to his first album or his Christmas albums. It's a medley of other artist's songs done in such a sappy way, i could no longer listen to it. This album stinks in A Thousand Different Ways."
3,Uninspired,"I'm a huge fan of Clay's - I think has been blessed with a beautiful voice, but I sadly have to say I was really disappointed with this CD. I don't know if most of the blame is on the arrangements that seemed to hold him back? Clay has a big strong voice, but he doesn't showcase that talent here. By the time I got to the last track, the one word that kept coming to my mind was uninspired.I hope he teams up with a songwriter for his next project and puts out a more personal and alive collection."
2,Poser,"Five stars? what the...? This album contains, what, 4 new songs and a load of uninspired renditions of cover songs. Is Clay Aiken going to ever turn out an album that tells us about him as an artist? I love the guy and his voice but he's on the brink of becoming a novelty act. I know plenty of singers who can sing the hell out of ""My Way"" but none of them will ever produce record albums, so I don't expect an accomplished singer to sell me the same, tired crap.We celebrated Clay during American Idol because he wasn't your run-of-the-mill, pretty-boy, mediocre talent; he was interesting...unique...different. He was celebrated because he possesses a skilled and refined instrument. Now, in album number 4, he uses that instrument to sell us what we've been sold by many others many times before without adding any substantial orinality to the presentation. It's just lazy. All these 5 star ratings are holding Clay to lesser standards. He's too good for this album."
3,A Thousand Different Ways,"I consider myself a loyal fan of Clay's. I am finding it hard to enjoy this CD. His voice is wonderful, love songs are good, but they all seem to sound alike to me. As much as I have tried to listen to the CD all the way through, I still haven't been able to yet."
1,What a load of crap,"I am flabergasted at the number of people who are giving this cd 4 and 5 stars. My question is ""how much did they pay you""?Come on- this cd is terrible. If Mr Clay keeps this up he will have plenty of time to perform oldies at weddings and birthday parties.In my opinion this spells the end for Mr Clay. His next stop will be the Las Vegas bone yard."
3,I miss Clay,"You can tell he's sad while he's singing this cd. Just listen to an song he sang a while ago and then a song he sang now, big difference. What happened to my happy Clay? If he knew we all loved him still, he'd be happier! This is a CD that an old artist who can't sing well anymore would sing. Not a rising star. We love you Clay! Come back!"
1,Just Dreadful !,"A million songs to choose from and Clay Aiken thinks that people want to hear his cover of Dolly Parton's Here You Come Again? Huh? I've seen some serious mis-steps in my time but this new CD by Clay Aiken really takes the cake. He claims that he's been on some anti-anxiety medications....well, he should have gotten off those medications before choosing his songs for this horrible collection. Thumbs way DOWN!"
1,"Ok, seriously, how about a REAL album from Clay???","A Christmas Album, now a Cover Album, yet his last REAL release was in 2003!! It's a good way for an artist to stay in the spotlight when they don't have enough inspiration to write original material, but for Clay, that's not a problem, since he doesn't write ANY of his own songs. How on Earth can someone go 3 1/2 years with no original material, when you don't even write your own music?!?Onto this cover album.... all I can say is, ""WOW!"". It was probably the worst collection of covers I have ever heard in my life. He absolutely BUTCHERS some extremely classic songs. This, coming from a guy who actually likes Clay's voice, and his debut album. Imagine what the haters would say!I mean, get real, Clay. This was an abomination, and so is the fact that back to back albums of yours aren't original material, which is a REAL album. What artist puts out a cover album when they're supposedly in their prime?!?!?"
4,What A Beautiful CD,"If you don't have this CD in your collection yet, run, don't walk, to your nearest retailer. Clay sings four new songs, including my favorite, Lonely No More, and uses his remarkable voice and unique style to remix some classic oldies. My fav here is ""Here You Come Again"" the Dolly Partain 80's hit. Clay did her proud with this one!"
5,AMAZING,"This CD captures Clay's magnificent vocals - justabsolutely LOVE IT.I was a little concerned about the ""covers"" but they aredone beautifully and of course the new songs - WOWOWOWOWOW.Another wonderful CD to add to my collection!!Mr. Clay Aiken - you never cease to amaze me!!Beautiful pure voice - never tire of listening to it."
4,The only one to buy after the first.,"The only Prime Suspect installment (other than the original) to be authored by Lynda La Plante, Prime Suspect 3 once again displays the hallmarks of La Plante's journalistic research base for creating fictional characters. In this case, ""rent boys"" are the fuel: young male prostitutes/street kids, and in particular one heartbreaking interview where a rent boy had told La Plante that he couldn't have AIDS, because he was only 15.Tennison finds herself investigating the burned body of a murdered rent boy found in a drag queen's flat, and begins to discover criminal ties from a community center that lead up into the highest ranks of the police, and she doesn't know whom to trust. Also, her old nemesis from PS1, Bill Otley, is part of her new team. With the amazing Helen Mirren, and an extraordinary support cast including Tom Bell, Ciaran Hinds, David Thewlis, and Peter Capaldi, this is, after the original, the strongest installment in the series."
3,Difficult subject,"This deals with the uncomfortable subject of pedophilia. The mystery is uncovered slowly, which is good, but the uncovering of the mystery happens in fits and starts, which I felt inferior to the steady pace (with a final surprise discovery) a good mystery should have. We know long before the end whodunit, but have to spend a third of the movie undoing the coverup. Thus the last third becomes a different kind of movie - more like a legal case. While that isn't bad, I think the change from requires a shifting of the viewer's expectations while following the plot.I also felt that the authorities-are-hiding-the-truth aspect was depicted as indecisive, which detracted from suspense, a needed attribute.Having said all that, the acting was well done - a standard for the series. The internal departmental wrangling and backstabbing were true-to-life, thoroughly believable, and the best parts of the episode. And the ending was credible."
1,only got part 1 of prime suspect 3 no part 2,the tape would have been great if i had gotten allof itnothing worse than only 1/2 of a story
3,Not quite what I was expecting.,"The knife has a beautiful picture on it, but other than that, I wasn't especially impressed. Keep in mind for the price I wasn't expecting anything spectacular, but this didn't meet my expectations. It was extremely lightweight. If it is going to be used on a daily basis, I don't expect it to hold up long. The white part with the duck scene on it doesn't fit right onto the handle. You can see where it was glued in. I bought this for my dad for a gift. He loves duck hunting. I don't think he will be using this in the duck blind. I hope he intends to leave it in the case and display it or something. Otherwise he may be trashing it before long."

5,Execellent Masterpiece!!,This is as good as it gets! The boss gives us another classic after his fantastic 70s albums. This album is one good song after another!..Born In the U.S.A...Cover me...Working in the highway...I am on a fire...are all classics! This is unquestionably one of the best rock albums in history. For those who review Bruce Springsteen's Political views...read my review of BORN TO RUN....That's all I gotta say!!
5,THE BOSS...,"I had always liked some of Springsteen's stuff, when I found out Max Weinberg (from the Conan O'brien Show) was his drummer... Then I met Max in person... I had to hear him play live with Springsteen, but sadly, as the band has been split up for quite a while now, I had to settle for ""live"" on CD... I LOVED IT! not only Max, but the whole Springsteen phenomenon! I quickly went out and bought Born in the U.S.A. to hear some of those songs in studio form... I haven't taken it out of my CD player for two months now! You really don't have to be a fan to love this album... It touches on everything from young love to hard times, and it envelops you and surrounds you and becomes as real as your life... It is absolutely PHENOMENAL. BUY IT!!!!!!!"
3,Not Bruce's Best Work,"The Album Born In the USA catapaulted Bruce Springsteen into Mega-Stardom, selling millions of copies (15 Million, to be exact) but as happens most often, an artists best selling album is not always the best. I am in now way trying to imply that I do not enjoy the music of Bruce Springsteen, because I am an avid fan. The sound here on this album is trying to appeal to the younger generation at the time, 1984, but still delivers drivng lyrics. Alot of people still belive that Born In the USA was a patriotic song, but the lyrics to this song are delivering an anti-war message alot of people missed. The lyrics alone on the album are worth 3 stars, but the pop sound didn't deliver for me. Bruce Springsteen's earlier work still reigns supreme."
5,the best,"I have bought alot of ""the boss's"" stuff but I keep coming back to this one...its the very best...not one song you wont love listening to and singing along with...its great!!!"
5,classic album,"bruces best album for me.i love every song and i can't say that about to many full albums.the ""glory days"" of music."
5,One of the best rock albums ever!!,Every song is a Springsteen classic and a hit!! How can you not play this album from beginning to end every time you pop it in!
3,"Maybe among his best sellers, but certainly not his best","Darlington County is about the only song I really like here, a few others (e.g., Glory Days) are OK, alot are just pop drivel"
3,No longer a favorite,"Born in the U.S.A. was a great hit album, but as others have said, maybe too commercial. The album was so over-played (not only on the radio, but by all who owned it). I can hardly stand to listen to it anymore. As a result I can honestly say I don't think Born in the U.S.A. has stood the test of time like many of Bruce's other recordings. For example, I can listen to Born to Run (and it could be said it has been over-played as well), and I get into it as much today as I did in 1975. Many of Bruce's early records and even Bruce's newer stuff (especially The Rising), I believe have, and will become classics for many. I just don't think the same can be said of Born in the U.S.A."
5,Just great Springsteen,"Springsteen is at his best with stories woven into fantastic rock and roll. This album contains one of my favorites - ""Glory Days"" and also includes the soulful ""I'm on Fire."" While most of the titles on this one are hits that received a lot of air play there are a couple of less known but delightful ones."
5,Another From the Boss' Peak Era,"This album has some of Springsteen's sharpest pop songwriting (""Dancing In The Dark,"" title track, ""Glory Days"") as well as some of his softest introspection (""I'm On Fire,"" ""My Hometown""), and I would rate it as his second best overall effort after ""Born To Run."" The Reagan Administration's ironic use of the title track, as well as the raving one-star reviews posted below, only go to show how subtle and pointed (and thus inaccessible to many right-wingers) the messages in the Boss' songs are. Classic."
2,Born in the USA DVD,I was dissappointed in this CD. For some reason the sound was not good and we had a hard time understanding the words.
2,It's a Bird! It's a Plane! It's...Arena Rock Man!!!,"The E Streeters sound as lame as a Bon Jovi cover band (folks, that's not a compliment). With this release, Bruce goes from scruffy Poet Laureate of the blue collar underdogs to heavy rotation MTV hottie. Sad. The ""Live 1975-85"" set is an even worse sell out. Guess the guy's Golden Age was ""Wild, Innocent"" to ""Nebraska""."
5,Bruce Springsteen Makes Another Great Album,"With BORN IN THE U.S.A., Bruce Springsteen made another great album. It's not quite as great as DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN, BORN TO RUN, or THE RIVER, but then again, those were so trenchant that nothing else he did could hope to measure up. Also, unlike those, this album, because it really made him as big as Coca-Cola, is a bit overplayed, but there are some undiscovered gems here, including ""Downbound Train"", ""No Surrender"", ""Bobby Jean"", and ""I'm Goin' Down."" The title track has been mistaken for a patriotic anthem by both Democratic and Republican politicians, but is really about a down-and-out Vietnam veteran. If you love the three aforementioned albums and THE RISING, you'll love BORN IN THE U.S.A."
5,I would miss it if it wasn't there,"Growing up to Bruce Springsteen's anthems I am proud to say that his music seems as relevant today as it was in the 80's. Today I heard his new album ""The Rising"" with the E Street Band after an 18 year hiatus and my skin remembered what it was like to listen to the Boss. Those that do not regularly listen to this music will not appreciate this but the music is more than just Rock, all the songs have a story to tell. They are about the out-of-luck lover (""I'm going down""), the friend (""Bobby Jean""), the Vet (""Born in the USA""), the unemployed (""Downbound Train"").Bruce picks a topic and sings about it. He doesn't just think he is a Rock Artist, he is a philosopher and a writer.This album is very much part of my journey. I would miss it if I couldn't touch it. Recently I got a new cover for it. Hoping that I will take it to my grave. Thanks Bruce."
5,classic,"My parents were both huge Springsteen fans so I heard this one quite a bit growing up. With that said, it's no wonder that it turned out to be one of my favorite albums ever. Oh, and what a great record it is... I've said before that if I had to narrow down my collection to just five cds, this would be one of the first ones I grabbed. In fact, this IS the first album I ever picked up on cd. The songs on here are simple, catchy, and all have a deep patriotic, but yet cynical flair that fits the working class like a glove. In short, this is THE working man's album. Songs like ""Cover Me"", ""Downbound Train"", ""Dancer In The Dark"", and ""Glory Days"" NEVER lose their charm."
4,Oh no Bruce has gone top forty?,This is a little commercial and top forty for Bruce but still head and shoulders above most of what passes for rock.
3,"Bruce's most ""pop"" album","This album really doesn't fit in with the rest of Bruce's work. It is so tailor made for a pop audience! Sure, it has some good stuff on it, but give me The River, Nebraska or Born to Run over this anyday!"
5,THIS IS A MASTERPIECE!,"I don't care what people say about this album - it's one of the best in rock history and that's it! Springsteen's ""Born in the USA"" is comparable to Tom Petty's ""Full moon fever"" - a true masterpiece! Anyone who likes good rock music would love this album.Want a tip? Check out John ""Cougar"" Mellencamp's ""Lonesome Jubilee""I don't hand out 5 stars easily but in this case I'm happy to give 5 solid and well earned stars."
5,A great rock album with a little bit of a southern twang,"This is one of Bruce's best albums in spite of the fact that it's been played to death on the radio. The songs rock from front to back, and there is no filler at all. Even the non-singles ""Downbound Train,"" ""Bobby Jean,"" and ""Darlington County"" are great. You really get a compelling and sometimes disturbing portrait of mid 80's America on this album, from the despairing title track to the wistful closer ""My Hometown."" It is also fascinating to listen to Bruce get inside the lives of some struggling everyday Americans. This is one of the most concise and satisfying rock and roll albums recorded in the Eighties. Add this essential CD to your collection."
5,music,GREAT CD had the album but had to have the CD due to the album being scracted. WHO doesn't like the BOSS!!!
4,"Born to Run, Born in the U.S.A.","The definitive 80s album from the Boss. Born in the USA is a satirical song talking about Vietnam. Reagan blithely used it as a campaign song. Cover Me , he was covered before, right? Darlington County is the lowkey. Working on the Highway is rock n roll. Downbound Train, I'm on Fire, No Surrender, Bobby Jean, I'm Goin' Down, Dancing in the Dark,My Hometown. All in a row."
5,Perfection,Iconic album worth every compliment I can think of... This album is absolutely incredible. Don't know what he could have done to make it better.
2,"Strictly commercial. It has a couple of gems, though.","This is by far the worst Springsteen I've heard. In fact, this was the first Springsteen I ever heard, and I hated the name until someone got me listening to his seventies stuff. The whole album's commercial pop. ""Glory Days"" ranks among the worst compositions by Bruce, and even though ""U.S.A."" has great lyrics, if you lived through the hype of this album in the 80s, the song really turns your stomach. ""I'm on Fire"" and ""My Hometown"" make the album. If you really want this one, your'e better off purchasing the cassette and not the CD. This one don't quite make it to a Worthy CD status. Your'e better off, in the 80s at least, with getting ""Tunnel of Love"". Now THAT is an album!"
5,MUCH BETTER SOUND THAN OTHER REVIEW SHOWS,"I purchased this disc after getting Tunnel of Love with the same Japan LP sleeve 2005 release. The Tunnel of Love had excellent sound quality so I figured that the Born in the USA if part of the same 2005 Japan release would have similar excellent sound quality. I was almost swayed against doing this by the reviewer indicating the sound was only as good as the domestic standard release. I took a chance and I am glad I did because the sound is excellent just like Tunnel of Love. This is an outstanding collection of Bruce tunes and it is great to hear them in such excellent sound quality. The sound is as at least as good if not better than the tracks from Born in the USA off of the Essential Springsteen 3 disc set. Hope this helps clarify for anyone with hesitation in getting this because of lack of quality mix in sound.Bruce (Tracy,CA)"
2,Hasn't aged well.,"I liked this went it first came out, but after all these years it really hasn't aged well to me. The production is too slick and popish. His overall sound doesn't do much of anything for me anymore. A legendary performer whose music will always be stuck in this era."
1,SUCKS,Everything about him and his music sucks. He has no talent at all. Just retire already the older you get the worst you get.
1,Yeah... it's garbage,"Alton music is right on! I talked to a music professor, showed him the analysis and made him listen to ""bored in the USA'. The dudes right!... it IS the same thing over and over. As for the subject matter bein' about somebody dying in A war?... well it don't sound like no sad song to me. Besides, if you think lyrics are meaningfull in pop music you probably like Bob Dylan. Prosody, which has to do with how music and lyrics go together; Springsteen ain't got it. His BAND,... now THEY WERE COOL!, and are the only reason anybody ever noticed him in the first place. Anyway, if you want meaningfull lyrics or want simple heartfelt music listen to Irish music or Gentle Giant. Simple is one thing, retarded pandering to the American public is another. Bruce Springsteen is living proof of P.T. Barnum's quote, ""Nobody ever went broke underestemating the intelligence of the American public."" Go get 'em Brucey!!!"
1,An Awful Book/Workbook,"This is a ridiculous publication. The ink smells like a book that was produced in someone's basement with cheap, toxic ink. The photo on the front is different from that on the website. But, now that I can see it, it is of 4 very stupid looking male models. Disgusting. I can't say anything good about the content. It has long explanations for things that should be presented in a clear and concise manner. This is a real cow pie."
5,market wizard wantabe,"Tony Saliba is a legend in the options trading world. I bought his book because I liked his chapter in ""Market Wizards"" where he talked about his style of trading. This book filled in the blanks behind what he was saying there. Now I am even more impressed by him because he can teach too! Thanks...for getting me started on the road to success."
4,Not bad,Content of book is good. Am questioning if there are some erratas in it though. I'll figure out by the end of the book.Major drawback is the softcover is starting to release the pages and it has not been treated badly. Possibly a poor binding job.
1,Invest in the market not this book,This is one of the worst options books ever written....my grandmother knows more about options than Mr. Saliba
1,Skeptical,"I am skeptical over the reviews of this book. I bought it but returned the book to Borders after a surprise check on Amazon.com on the reviews by so-called ""readers"" here. If you look at the review dates, all were dated around May-June 2002. If you're not convinced, click on each reviewer and most of them actually did only review (5 stars) for this book. Who knows, it could be a marketing tactics? I went over to check Barnes & Noble and it was exactly the same.. reviews were all done from May-June 2002 then full-stop. So I'm not saying anything, I did buy the book for 2 days, but I was not impressed. No thanks."
5,Excellent learning book for technical option learning,"This books explains most option constructions and how to calculate there potential profit. If you need to train yourself in spreads concepts, this training manual is for you. First the spread is explained and then some calculation examples are given. Don't expect a when to use these spreads manual. It's not there. This is a excellent book for training yourself in setting up all kind of option structures and know what the costs are and profits. Also all the Greeks are explained in detail, and the first manual that makes it understandable for me :-)"
5,Options workbook for Dummies,"I picked up this book in preparation for an interview I was having in the equity structured products desk at Morgan Stanley. Although I had taken a Financial Derivatives class at Wharton, this book helped explain the basics. It goes through all of the fundamental and basic strategies, as well as spreads. The value in the book is in doing the examples and working out the max gains, loses, break-evens etc. It seems basic but as you begin to put together more complex trades these exercises stay with you and guide your understanding. The book also does a decent job of explaining the Greeks and volatility. You won't come away ready to put on any overly complex trades, but you might be comfortable putting on your first call back spread knowing what your risk and reward profile is."
4,Perfect for a wall chart,"Saliba describes each of his fundamental spread concepts and strategies in plain simple english, yet so concise, almost skeletal with such verve that I decided to construct a wall chart reflecting its contents.The wall chart now sits proudly on my wall ( in the presence of 3 other wall charts ) and shows the 7 categories of option strategies - Synthetics, Insurance, Directional/Neutral, Directional, Either Direction, Non Directional and Volatility and their sub categories etc.For this reason I think that Salibas book is perfect for the beginner."
5,Chopin's genius played beautifully by another genius,"What can one say re. the music of Chopin that has not already been said. The catch is to have it performed with the sensitivity and clarity of purpose it was created to do. Evgeny Kissin accomplishes this with apparent ease and great passion. The triumvirate of Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven omits one other of equal talent. Guess who. The audio is perfect as is the condition of the 'used' recording."
3,Brilliantly performed but boring,"Recently I am always disappointed with Kissin's new releases. Of course, he has no problem with technical dificculties proposed by Chopin and his interpretation is very much traditional. But I cannot help feeling something very shallow in his performances. Almost all the climaxes of these pieces sound obligatory, unlike Martha Argerich or Sviatoslav Richter, who can give these pieces intrinsic liveliness.I hope that he will be able to get into pieces much more emotionally in the future."
3,There is better,"There are numerous reviewers saying that Kissin ""opened their eyes to Chopin's unique talent"" and such. Well, if Kissin could do that with this set of recordings, buy Horowitz's Favorite Chopin volumes and let your mind be boggled. This is how I feel whenever I perform a piece . . . mushy, condensed, unclear. The unknowledgeable audience does not have any idea that the performance could have been better, but it could have! Let me tell you, Kissin is fantastic technically, but absolutely incomparable to Horowitz or even many others.Buy this if you really want to. Kissin's G Minor Ballade is restrained, something entirely unacceptable in Chopin."
5,Vibrant performances,"While Kissin's recording of the Chopin Ballades won't displace Rubinstein from my shelf, he nevertheless offers the listener much to enjoy here. He does take some liberties which can be a bit extreme, as noted in a previous review, but his virtuosity is compelling. I felt that the sound and the production were both outstanding, but this is always a subjective judgment, especially when discussing recordings of solo piano music. If you must have your Ballades played the way you have always heard them, then this recording is probably not for you. But if you are ready for a different approach, give it a try."
5,Brave approach,"There are many things I wished for more in this recording that I did not here, but also a seemingly limitless amount of surprises to be discovered every time I listen to this CD. It is nonsense to talk about his tecnique - take that for granted, but the interpretations are full of contrasts and yet fluid. And that in these ups and downs there are solid ideas under construction is a marvel seldom heard of. I strongly recommend this performance if your looking for a new approach to the ballades - still the Rubinstein recording is master."
5,An emotional experience,"A book that is hilariious, beautiful & deeply sad. This book carried me on a rollercoaster of emotions. I was laughing out loud one second and almost crying for the children the next. The children in this book will stay with you for a long time. This is a book well worth reading. You won't be sorry if you do."
1,WARNING Not Christian Theology but New Age and the Occult,"Warning: this book is not chrisitian but New Age and the Occult. The author spent the last two years of her life in the blackest psychotic depression according to psychologist and priest Fr. Benedict Groeschel who is also an expert in private revelations. Go to the EWTN website and find the article in the document library under the heading of New Age and Cults, keyword A COURSE IN MIRACLES. Fr. Groeschel was an aquaintance of the author and gave an eulogy at her funeral. Fr. Groeschel believes that the author's experience with the channeled ""spirit"" was possibly a true diabolic manifestation."
1,This is NOT a DVD as listed in the product description,The listing page for this item indicates it's a DVD but it is not!!It is a CD-ROM game. Just be aware of this - if I had read the reviews more carefully I wouldn't have wasted money on this item!!!
2,Very scratched!,"The CD was so deeply scratched that every song skipped and two wouldnt even play. after using a disc repair unit I was able to clean up some of the skips, but the two songs that originally would play skip continuously."
4,(just like the package says) Not really for Fireplaces...,I went to a hardware store looking for fireplace paint. The guy in the paint department said that this was all they had. This paint is technically not for fireplaces. The painted surface is not supposed to touch flame.I had read somewhere that someone else had some success with this paint on a surface that touched flame. I was installing an artificial log set so I figured the flame wouldn't touch the walls much. After installation there is a part of the wall that the flame regularly touches. Some of the paint in that area is flaking off a little. The flaking is in faux grout grooves of the fake brick surface. It could be that I just didn't clean that surface adequately prior to painting.The paint itself does have a nice look and texture. I am very pleased with how it looks so far.
2,eh....did not perform as expected.....,"I purchased this to remove the rust off of my BBQ grill. It did not get it off...as a matter of fact, it barely got any of it off. Very dissapointed."
3,So So,"I was well into this book and thinking ""This author does NOT like middle eastern dance"" You can imagine my suprise when I got to the last chapter and realized middle eastern dance is her passion. The last chapter was the only one that kept me interested. The rest of the book had some small interesting tid-bits, but just not enough. I do see she as a book just on middle eastern dance and I will give that a try. This one was a little hard to read."
4,biters,"I remember when this cd first came out, a lot of so called ""real rappers"" dissed Shaq...now, as quiet as it is kept, alot a rappers out today are biting Shaq's flow...Tupac even bit Shaq's flow."
5,Utterly Amazing,"When I heard this cd didnt win a grammy, i was overcome with confusion. Are the judges deaf? Can they not hear the surreal power and rthym of Shaq O'neil' music? This cd changed my life from a spiritual standpoint. It's hard to listen to without tears startign to trickle down my face. Bravo Shaw, bravo."
2,Shaq Phooey,"Shaquille O'Neal raps about as well as he shoots free throws. Most of the songs here are pretty boring. A lot of guest rappers were brought in, but they don't help much. The only song that is above average is ""Biological Didn't Bother"", which is a love song to Shaq's stepfather. It's actually pretty touching, believe it or not. I didn't like this CD that much, but Shaq's fans are free to disagree with me."
2,I agree with this last reviewer--skip this CD,"I'm a huge fan of the Bottle Rockets and the thing I love so much about their work is how it transcends ""bar rock"", or, rather, it recreates the feeling of ""bar rock"" without having to do yet another cover of ""Sweet Home Alabama"" or ""Free Bird."" It's a reinvention of sorts, or, rather, the distillation of all the best parts into one new, interesting new whole. That combination of energy and brains and country and blues made the earlier CD's so cool and what made this new one a drag. I was glad I listened to this before I bought it so I could save some money. It's not up to par with ""The Brooklyn Side"" and ""24 Hours"" and I think that's a real shame."
4,"pretty good; recommend it; 1 AWESOME song, rest pretty good","This CD is good, I recommend it. It has 1 really, really awesome song on it (bar's on fire), has some other pretty cool songs on it (nancy sinatra, gotta get up) overall pretty good, plus, i know these guys, so support them!"
3,This one gets better with age,"I too am an all out Bottle Rockets fan and would probably buy their version of Green Eggs and Ham. Brand New Year, has a more slick sound and a lyric structure that is more rigid than their previous, but with your 4th or 5th listen, Brian Henneman's humor and glibness definitely become noticeable. Bands need to grow and branch out and that is what the Rockets are doing here. They want to rock as much as the next guy and seem to throw subtlety to the wind. I would recommend 24 Hours a Day as the starter disk--but for tunes for a drive thru the heartland, Brand New Year still satisfies."
4,Pure unadulterated American rock and roll.,"I'm 43 years old now, and the music business has always mystified me. Why some bands make it and others don't. If anyone saw the recent MTV Video Awards, it's painfully obvious that popular music is at an all-time low. The Bottle Rockets latest release may sound like an anachronism to today's record buying public that don't know any better, but this album is a classic of down-home American rock and roll. Fusing bar-band chops, blues, and Creedence-style licks - this is one of those albums that I will play for my young kids years from now when they ask me to put on a REAL rock and roll album."
3,Well...it's okay....,"Like many of the others here, I am a huge Bottle Rockets fan. I own all their previous albums, so buying this one was a no-brainer. Unfortunately, this just isn't up to snuff. Much of the subtlety and the southern and country-influenced twang that made the prior recordings so enjoyable is gone here. Granted, there are some great moments (""White Boy Blues"" was a particular stand out for me), but I haven't quite come to terms with the whole package yet. All in all this sounds too much like half the crap that gets played on my local AOR station. The thing that always made the Bottle Rockets great was being able to pay homage to that sound without imitating it and while acknowledging some deeper roots than early 1970s mainstream rock. I hope this is just a digression and not a permanent diversion. This isn't branching out. It's regressing."
4,This CD will change your perception of pop music.,"As others have, I first became acquainted with Akino Arai through her work on ""Outlaw Star."" She recorded both end themes, ""Hiru no Tsuki"" (Melfina's Theme) and ""Tsuki no Ie."" This is truly an album in the artistic sense. The theme is an exploration of the offerings on the radio dial, thus the selections are eclectic. However, whatever the musical style, all the cuts are done with the virtuosity, humor, refreshing intelligence, and enchantingly understated style for which Miss Arai is known. The entertainment value of this very enjoyable album has changed my perception of pop music. As performed by Akino Arai, ""Koseki Radio"" is a rare treat. (BTW, the tenth track is ""Riskcaution Corporation."")"
1,Very Basic Overview,The Inductor Handbook was a real disappointment. The information is a superficial overview of how to select inductors for basic applications. It might be suitable for a hobbyist or student but is not the caliber of information required by a modern technical professional. There is little information about the design of inductors and no information about computer modeling - crucial in today's environment. More useful information can be obtained from manufacturer's spec sheets and application notes.
3,It is ok for a basic beginning.,"It covers mostly all what should be known about inductors. Of course this is not a graduate level book, but the author mention all the references that could be consulted for a further deeper understanding.I recommend this handbook for layperson on the subject, hobbyists or high school students."
5,Great resource for evolving development environments,"When I first saw this book I looked at the Table of Contents and thought: who is it for? Isn't it a bit too broad? It's not a book about any specific approach to web development. It turned out that was exactly what our team needed. We're a shop with Perl CGI, Cold Fusion and ASP, and we're migrating to servlets and JSP. We knew what we knew, but stumbled as we tried to learn the new technology. Instead of giving us tunnel vision about one particular approach, this book explained what different approaches have in common and how knowledge about one can be transfered to another. We keep a library of books for the team to use, and the books that are always out are the Dynamic HTML Definitive Guide and this one. A great investment!"
4,Wonderful explanation about Web application architectures,"Amazing insight about how browsers work, how web servers work plus how they talk to each other.I highly recommend this book"
2,Stale Stooges,"The enduring popularity of The Three Stooges is directly attributable to the 190 comedy shorts the team made for Columbia Pictures (1934-1959), particularly the 97 entries featuring Curly Howard as the third Stooge. While several of these classic comedies are available on DVD, a few non-Columbia Stooge curios have turned up, including this title.SWING PARADE OF 1946 is a low-budget musical produced by the lowly Monogram Pictures, starring Gale Storm and Phil Regan, with Moe, Larry and Curly providing comedy relief. Away from their home studio, the boys seem to be a little disoriented; worse yet, Curly is clearly in declining health (later that year he suffered a stroke that forced him to drop out of the act). Rabid Stooge fans may want to check this one out, although it's nowhere near the level of their best work. Casual viewers in search of the usual boisterous antics are advised to look elsewhere."
2,Monogram's Historic Curio,"""Swing Parade of 1946"" is a low-budget Monogram hodgepodge with some intriguing talent on display. Behind the cameras are cult filmmaker Phil Karlson and future writer-director Nicholas Ray (credited with ""additional dialogue""). In front of the cameras are Louis Jordan, Connee Boswell, Gale Storm, Edward Brophy and comic relief from the Three Stooges (their last feature with Curly Howard). Standout numbers include Jordan's ""Caldonia"" and Boswell's ""Stormy Weather."" The Stooges help enliven the dead spots. Hardly classic cinema, but a historic curio nonetheless."
2,Louis Jordan and 3 Stooges save the show,"Acting is poor and most of the music is nearly unbearably dull. I bought this movie for Louis Jordan's two appearances, and was not disappointed. Louis' performances of ""Don't Worry 'bout That Mule"" and ""Caldonia"" shine. The 3 Stooges are the only other enjoyable part of the film, especially Curley's performance as a dumb waiter. If you're not a Stooges or Swing fan, forget it."
3,Swing Swing,"This movie is kind of a snoozer. However, it does feature an appearance by the Three Stooges. This is just a short time before Curly suffered his career ending stroke so he wasn't as sharp as normal. The Stooges help to vitalize the film. The acting in this movie is not the best. As you could tell by the title the movie features a lot of swing...and if you like swing then by all means go out and get this. But as an overall movie it was below par. It's nice to see the Stooges in a feature, with a fairly prominent role. Too bad it was at the end of Curly's career."
3,"Great movie, bad picture quality.","This is an excellent movie with the Three Stooges in major supporting roles. This was Curly's last feature. The only problem, at least on my copy, is the picture quality. It is only marginally better than the budget version on Goodtimes. The sound is much better here, however. Also, there are no menus, extras, or special features of any kind. The DVD simply plays from beginning to end like a VHS. The Stooges are their typical corny selves, but the scene near the end with the kid auditioning for a job at the nightclub (no Stooges) is worth the price alone!!!!"
1,Does not work,"I bought this item to connect two computers and it is not easy to use. I recently removed from my computer. It does not work with USB keyboard or mouse, not even with the adapter."
3,"Imaginative and original, but crude compared to it's sequels","It's a great book alright. Although not the best one to start the series off (Will probably give a bad impression to newcomers) it's still a pretty decent book. The laughs aren't Laugh-out-loud stuff and they really don't come as often. The characters are as original as the world itself, but there's none of the MAGIC that pratchett writes that can be seen as soon it's sequel, The Light Fantastic. In this book, the characters wander aimlessly through the world, without much MAJOR objective in mind.Is it worth your time and money? Yes. But don't think the entire series stays like this (it improves a lot!)After reading this book, I wasn't really encouraged to buy it's sequels. If I hadn't read on the internet that it gets a LOT better, I would've never had. Thank God for the internet"
5,An addiction that leaves you wondering whats in the ink.,"New to the Disc? Well you've come to the right place. This is the beginning of a world that will take you to far away places (most of which are lethal to foreigners), introduce you to the disc's most colorful inhabitants (at least the ones with the highest survival rate), and wrap you in the octrane glow of Discworld magic (which has a tendency to do what it wants to who it wants). The Color of Magic starts you on that road. Enter Rincewind see how brave, see how daring, see the reluctance overcoming the former two? Rincewind is a wizard of sorts who finds himself thrown by Fate (and Several Other Gods) into the company of Twoflower the Discs first tourist. Choas and high adventure insue propelling the two from one part of the Disc to the next leaving havoc and ruin in their wake. If your feeling left out of something special that to date you only heard dark whisperings about then heres the key, Discworlds the gate and its only one way."
5,Brilliant,"Pratchett is a delight. He is witty, intelligent and creative. His books are always a mood lifter, and this book is the beginning of a series that delights with every volume. Well worth the price, and a welcome addition to any library. I have read it and re-read it."
3,interesting story line,"I sort of enjoyed this book, but not enough to read any more by Pratchett. Although I love fantasy stories, this one was just a bit too out there for me. This is a rather short book and I can recomend it to most anyone to determine whether it is their kind of story so as to, or not, continue on with the many books that follow in this series."
5,The Colour of Magic,This is a timeless clasic from Terry Pratchet.A must read for those of a mind for riding on a turtle
4,Terry has made a new fan,"This book has been a thrill to read, it kept me on the tips of the pages wanting to keep reading even while my mom was yelling at me to go to sleep. It is the first book I've ever read that has been in the humourous/fantasy catagory and I can""t wait untill I can make it back to get the second! Rincewind and Twoflower are the most hilarious heros ever in the fantasy department. Thumbs up!"
1,No plot. Did not make any sense,"This was a horrible book. The author obviously had no outline for the plot, and spent more time creating a fantasy world then a story that happened in it. What a total waste of my time."
3,not so great Discworld,"bought this based on numerous glowing reviews, but didn't think it was roaringly funny as expected..a satire on such an obvious, easy target isn't necessarily going to be as funny as I wanted it to be..there were some entertaining flights of imagination, but I was expecting a more amazing read, could be that to spoof a genre you need to incorporate many elements of that genre, making the spoof predictable."
2,"Too many dull passages, but I'll try the author again.","I managed to get through the whole book, although I was tempted to drop it half way through, from boredom.It's occasionally lively and humorous, but there are too many dull passages, in my opinion.After reading about 200 pages, I skipped to the end. It has a funny ending, so I have ordered oneof the author's later books - from the library."
4,"So far, a lot of fun.","I'm only about 50 pages in... which is just about where it's become compelling and I know I'm going to pick it back up and read more. It's such a fanciful universe, that it takes a while to become grounded and attach to the narrative. But now, I think I'm there."
3,Interesting Beginning,"I admit that I did not read this series in order. Fortunately, I started with #8 Guards, Guards! which is a first book for Pratchett's City Watch series. The Color of Magic, though not among the best, is still good - a necessary introduction to the Discworld. This is where I first met Rincewind and the Luggage. I have not read the later book about Agatea, Twoflower's country of birth, but I can't wait to see what life is like there."
4,Great reading ! :),"This book is funny and good written. You get caught up really sometimes. If you are a new reader start with this book, since its the first. Although the second, The Light Fantastic, is better, this is a book well worth reading!"
2,"I'd rather not give poor reviews, but...","I was disappointed. I've had Terry Pratchett recommended to me by several people to whom I can usually relate when it comes to books. It seems by some reviews that his books get better, but after this one I'm really not too sure I want to read more of his work. To all of you Terry Pratchett fans who are going to get up in arms because I negatively reviewed this, I understood all of the ""deeper meanings"" and the humor, I even chuckled a few times. Pratchett just fell very short of creating a masterpiece. I love dry humor and social commentary, and I consider Douglas Adams a genius, this just seemed like a very poor attempt to emulate Douglas Adams."
3,The first DiscWorld Book,"Good read, though not as entertaining as some of the later ones I have read. That said, a great start to the wonderful Discworld series and an entertaining and enjoyable read."
3,Bad start to a great series,"Terry Pratchett's Discworld books are usually excellent, but the first couple are on the weak side. If you're new to the series then I'd suggest starting with Equal Rites or Mort and go from there for a while, then read the first two later when you're in a more forgiving mood."
2,Big Disappointment for me,"I have been a fan of Douglas Adams for a very long time, and this was recommended to me by someone who claimed that if you liked Douglas Adams you would love the Discworld books. I was really disappointed. There is a bit of an interesting story here but it is buried under so much nonsense that you have to work really hard to find it. Where Adams uses silliness and non sequitur artfully Pratchet uses it like a 14 year old uses that new curse word he just learned; it's just there for the sake of being there it obscures the story instead of enhancing it."
3,Not a big fan of fantasy books.,"This book was part of our book club reading list, chosen for it's humor and satire. It did fulfill those qualities, but the book kept jumping around from place to place; ""person"" to ""person."" Not my ""thing"". With just a few exceptions, fantasy books are not my favorite free time reading. Give me a good Tolkien or at the other end of the spectrum, Rowling book. I'll stick to sci-fi writers Arthur Clarke, George Lucas or Rod Serling, I won't bother reading the rest of the Discworld series."
5,I laugh so hard it hurt,"Look, if you are a fan of fantasy, then pick this book up. It will have you in stitches. This is where the whole Discworld series gets it start.Pratchett is on par with Christopher Moore and Douglas Adams."
5,Thank you!,"I had been delaying reading the Discworld series because I never could find this book, the first one in the series. Thanks to the publisher for finally republishing it so I could get started - these books are the funniest books I've read in quite a while. If you haven't read them yet, do yourself a favor and at least pick up this one. Pratchett's writings are similar to Douglas Adams at his best; but, unlike Adams, the quality of these books does not decline as the number increases."
4,A hint of what's to come in the series...,"My first book in the series, and I'm hooked. After reading many reviews, I started reading with the caveat that it wasn't one of the strongest of the group so I didn't have super high expectations, but it was fun and engaging and funny and clever...what more would I want? Have already order the next two and am looking forward to continuing this journey."
2,the book was medioca at best,enjoyed the service and convience of ordering through amazon. the book was not one that I will purchase sequals of
1,terry pratchett,Definitely must be a children's book. Written by a child for a child with absolutely no life experience. I read many books of many genres and this book is completely and utterly boring...Maybe he puts together some fancy little one liners and a couple of odd pairing of words. This is definitely not a timeless novel. Not a book I would recommend wasting your time on. Sadly my boyfriend recommended this book to me and I am quite disappointed at his lack of taste and style. My imagination needs a bit more colors than this. Anyone who can rave about this book has absolutely no clue about art or true writing. It is rigidly boring and a pretentious piece of writing. I don't see how anyone can waste there time on this book...It is really very pathetic and disturbing.
4,A good laugh,"This is not a serious book, and it never pretends to be, and quite frankly thats why i like it. My biggest question with this series is why it took me so long to finally pick up the series.Color or Magic is Terry Pratchett's first novel in the Discworld series, and its filled with the absurd humor that makes you want to read more and more. Pratchett takes the ordinary from our world and shows just how wierd it can be, the concept of insurance for example. And the ""main"" characters of this novel are great: Twoflower teh tourist with his naivete, and Rincewind the wizard with his pessimism.If you enjoy reading Douglas Adams or John Swartzwelder, how have you not read this series yet? This book isn't laugh out loud funny, its make your brain think funny, and in my opinion this is the best kind!"
4,A keeper.,I finished it this morning before work. What a great story! It is an enormous spoof with great wit and hilarity. I found myself laughing out loud several times and will probably listen to it again to glean any missed nuggets.
5,Awesome Story,"Loved this story, it defiantly got me hooked on the series. Its confusing for the first 30 pages because you're just plopped down in the world and it takes a bit to figure everything."
5,Great Fantasy,A great fantasy read that will get you started in a series of satire fantasy you can read any time. It is part of the series of Discworld novels but is so fun to read it does not seem like a commitment to read them like other fantasy series seem to become.
2,I Couldn't Finish,"I got this book on a whim about 2 ago for a light read. I had never read any of Terry Pratchet's books but I had heard his books were similar to Douglas Adam's, which I particularly like. I was disapointed. I thought it started off good enough, once I figured out what was happening. After that though, it went down hill. I thought the different stories got less amusing as they went along until I finially stopped halfway through the last one. Another thing I didn't enjoy was how each of the ""chapters"" was infact a different story and didn't tie to the others at all. They didn't seem very well developed and I didn't like how I felt as though I was starting off another book every chapter. Finially I didn't find any of them terribly funny. I really do like satires but it just wasn't coming through to me in this book. If you want to start reading Discworld with this novel I don't suggest it, I'll be renting my next one from the library instead."
2,"Not his best work, no doubt about it","After reading several books from the series, I decided to obtain the very first book and see (or shall I say ""read"") how it all started. Although the book goes through all one needs to know about the history of DISCWORLD, the book lacks the magnificent humor and sensetive touch Pratchett uses so talently later in the series."
3,Entertaining and Fun,"Being a massive fan of humorous fantasy/sci-fi writers like Rankin and Adams I thought I'd give the highly popular Pratchett a try. Since The Colour of Magic is the first in the Discworld series it's the most obvious place to start. Although the novel was entertaining and fairly humorous I couldn't help but be a bit disappointed. I think I probably expected the novel to be a fantasy version of The Hitchhiker's Guide when, in fact, Pratchett relies less on the silly humour of Adams and Rankin and thus, in my opinion, is less side-splittingly funny. The Colour of Magic is never-the-less an enjoyable romp through the Discworld and I'll definately be reading the sequel The Light Fantastic."
3,"Weird, confusing, strange, humorous, ridiculous",I've just finished reading this & I'm scratching my head as to whether I like it or not. The first 30 pages were completely confusing as the author introduced too many characters in a world I hadn't yet grasped. After a while everything falls into place & makes sense (or nonsense) but you'll get the drift soon enough. At times it's really interesting but then the story will go off on a wild direction. It's not terribly cohesive although that's probably the idea. I can see how some people could find this addictive & I imagine if I continue reading the series I may fall under Pratchett's spell. If this sort of over the top humour fantasy has got you interested it's probably worth giving it a go but it will not appeal to everybody.
2,I thought I was the right audience.,"I don't get it.I'm a geek by every definition. I love strange new worlds, I love to explore new characters, and I love absurdity. I feel like I'm the perfect audience for this book. But I simply don't get it. I wish I did."
3,The entryway into a fantastic series.,"Dispite the three star rating I absolutely recommend this book as the first in a series of wonderfully hilarius satire by Terry Pratchett. This introduction to the Disc World is a bit rough around the edges, but it's also the first book in the series. Pratchett's style and the development of the characters matures throughout the series only becomming better with time."
3,I'm glad I didn't start here.,"This book, along with the next two (The Light Fantastic and Equal Rites) is far from the high point of the Discworld series. Terry hadn't yet refined his style, and these books don't have much of a plot. True, there are some good jokes, but nothing as memorable or hilarious as Pratchett came up with later. The series didn't really get off to a good start until Mort was published (and what a start it was...). If you haven't read any Discworld yet, you should start with Mort, Small Gods, or Guards! Guards! and come back to this one later. Or, start here, but know that it will get quite a lot better."
2,Read the book!,"The story of Gladys Aylward is amazing, for sure! I just don't understand why they felt they needed to change it so much in the movie. Her story was told in a book called ""The Little Woman"". If you read that, you'll get a much better picture of what actually happened and of what Gladys was really about! It's not a bad movie, but it could have been so much better if they had stuck to the facts."
2,Follow your Dreams,"This movie should be watched by any person who has that nagging feeling there is something she needs to accomplish in her life and she is not sure she can do it. You CAN! And only God knows hoe WONDERFUL an adventure that will be for you!I rated it 5 stars, can't seem to fix the fact only 2 show up. This movie is on my top 5!"
5,A Highly Inspiring Story of a Devoted Christine Missionary.,"This movie is the real life story of Gladys Aylward, a Christian woman who was devoted to God and wanted to serve Him.She was a poor servant girl in England, not educated, but the love of God lived in her heart and she wanted to share thislove with the people in China who did not know the love of God.She saved her money and took a dangerous jurney to China, joined with a missionary woman in Northern China andserved as a missionary, helping the chineese people, and telling them about Jesus and the love of God.She saved abandoned children`s lives, she ended up with 100 orphened children.When the war started in the North, she rescued the 100 orphans by leading them through mountains and rivers to safetyto a Christian Mission in a far province.It is a highly inspiring story of a Christian Missionary, there are books written of her biography more true to her life story."
1,Terrible Outdated Movie,"This a typical Hollywood movie that has absolutely no biblical scripture quoted and there is no message about Jesus Christ. It was poorly scripted and an absolute ""slap in the face"" for Christian believers. Some people have given it a high rating because of the photography. Does that justify leaving out the Christian message?"
1,bait and switch,"Wow, I was excited to see a movie about the life of Gladys Aylward after having read the book Gladys Aylward: the Little Woman. My wife and I proceeded to get sick to our stomachs the further we went into this mockery of a biography. They took a true story about a love relationship between miss Aylward and the Lord Jesus Christ and twisted it into a love afair with her and another character. Many of the miraculous events of Aylward's life were glossed over, ignored or just changed. The saddest part is that she was still alive when this movie was released. I guess I shouldn't have expected Hollywood to understand her life and I shouldn't be angry with them either, but it is quite frustrating.p.s. John 14:6"
5,Historical Drama,Product arrived new and promptly as stated by Amazon. Story line strong - supposed to be based on a true story. Bergman did her usual excellent performance as expected. Glad to have the movie.
4,Read a good book about Gladys!,"The movie is a wonderful movie and great characters and inspiring. When you are done watching it, get a good book about the real Gladys and learn why she was so loving. When faced with the hardships she went through it is not enough to feel like it. She believed in Jesus Christ who put the love in her heart to do what she did. She was complete not because of a man's love, which did not really happen, but complete in Christ. She obeyed God no matter who said what or what the circumstances were and God showed His faithfulness to her. Seek out her source of love: Jesus. Great movie--read the book!"
5,Tops My List,This is one of my all time favorite movies and now on DVD I loved it all over again. Great actors and acting. Wonderful and inspiring story.
5,Great Sunday Movie,The Inn of the Sixth Happiness is a great Sunday-after-church movie for the whole family. It is a true story of an amazing woman. Great look into the culture of China.
3,Very good movie...,but not a very true story of Gladys. Ingrid Bergman does a great job in this movie. Too bad the movie is way off base about the real missionary.
5,Number 1 on My Top 20 List!,"This is the also the most moving and touching film I have ever seen in my life. It had been a couple of years since I watched it, so I ordered it from Amazon.com and got it in a couple o days. I still can't make it through the movie without laying waste to half a box of tissues."
5,excellent movie. it keeps you on the edge of your seat almost from start to finish,"I have never been a great fan of Ingrid Bergman, but she is outstanding in this film. The children are wonderful and their plight is heart wrenching. It is one of my favorite movies and we are avid collectors."
4,excellent movie,"The story is wonderfully presented. The actors all seem to fit their parts. The scenery and score are lovely.The determination of Gladys should inspire us all. She worked so hard to achieve her dream. She undertook a perilous journey to get to China. It could have been a movie all by itself. Her persistance in trying to bring her missionary message to China is done with a kind heart.Yes, the book is better. All books are better than the movie. But this is a long movie to have included everything would have diluted the main story. The main story is Gladys at the Inn.Actually this movie made me want to read this book. Though out of print it can be found through Amazon or American Book Exchange. I recommend this as a movie or book."
4,Very good movie,"This was a very good movie, although, as usually found-- it doesn't quite go along with the ""original"" version-- or what actually happened. Even so, it's a good movie and inspiring for people of all ages."
3,Hollywood fiction,"The true story is far more interesting that this fictionalized version. The best account is surely Aylward's own: 'The Little Woman' (with Christine Hunter, ISBN 0802429866).The scant value of this movie may lie in making Gladys Aylward's name known to the non-reading movie-watching public. This movie may deserve to be forgotten, but not Gladys Aylward. Unfortunately, unless you read a book or two, you will not know anything real.Possibly Hollywood did not want to confront the horrible truth about Communism in China. This movie does not take Aylward's life that far in time."
2,Unreadable as a Beginner's Learning Guide,"This is a bad book if you are not already familiar with the basic concepts of the material. The author was more interested in showing worked examples than explaining concepts, and the more difficult problems in the exercise sections do not have solutions in the back of the book, so even 'self-learning' is extremely hard.Unless you have a very good teacher, you will not benefit from the way the material is presented inside this book. 'Solutions' and 'examples' are presented 'as is' without explanations. One of my friends into math did mention it's not a bad reference guide for proofs, but he was as unimpressed with this book as a learning tool as I was. The level of rigor is very high, but the simple explanations to go with it are not present. I advise finding a good source on the subject instead of this unfriendly text, which has a target audience of math professionals."
1,Do not buy this book.,"This book is very poorly written and lacks any kind of order in which to study the chapters. The explanations of theorums and formulas are just not enough. Another thing that I do not like about this is that the section problems want you to work out precise mathematical concepts that were not explained in the relevant section, thus making you have to re-read the section several times over, and even then it is still not enough. I have completed Calculus II and that textbook was nowhere near as difficult to understand than this one. If you want to get a general idea of what Discret Mathematics is or want to do self study, then get this book. But in my opinion, avoid this book at all cost. Pun intended."
3,almost good,"I heard Richard Moore read passages from ""The Mouse Whole"" and have since read other passages from the book. In a nutshell, I would say this work is a near miss. It is steeped in satirical tradition, and nearly every other literary tradition, for that matter. The clever rhymes remind one of Formalist or Metaphysical wit or of Byron's ""Don Juan,"" the digressions remind one of ""Tristram Shandy,"" etc. However, nearly all of these comparisons are to this most recent work's disadvantage. It is serious where it should be playful, and playful where it should be serious, and the clever rhymes begin to grate on one's ears after prolonged listening. The book is competent without being memorable."
3,Expendable Italians?,"Tim Parks writes remarkably well and can describe situations with painstaking insight. Yet, when he deals with Italy, he may become unbearably patronizing. I often wonder whether his books generally aim at explaining Italy or at reassuring English readers of their supposed superiority to the Italian comedy of questionable manners and corrupted politics.In the past, Tim Parks has lived in the United States for long. Will he eventually have the courage to contend with American social mores with the same acerbic wit he employs with the Italians?"
5,Entertaining and down-to-Earth,The author has a wonderful sense of humor. Reading about Italy from the perspective of a parent raising his children was very amusing and interesting. I found this book to be a fast and enjoyable (sometimes hilarious) read!
4,An accurate view of expatriate fatherhood,"Parks accurately and eloquently describes the challenges, frustrations, and joys of raising one's children in a foreign culture. Although this is may be too domestic a subject for those not currently challenged by parenthood themselves (as it would have been for me just two years ago), both expats living in Italy and those living elsewhere will be inspired by Parks' diplomacy and philosophy in negotiating his children's upbringing with the entire county, who see things differently.Ultimately, it is just such a study of the Italian household which gives a deeper picture of the Italian culture than any history book or political essay ever could.Parks narrates his portrait lovingly (I disgree with a previous reader's conclusion that Parks 'doesn't like Italians'), and page after page I found that Parks has the eloquence, humour, and grace to express what I had often observered here in my corner of Italy."
4,A Fascinating Glimpse into Italy's family culture,"""An Italian Education"" will not only appeal to Italophiles but also to parents who will enjoy the author's vivid descriptions of family life in another country. Its actually a two country comparative study of family life, Italy, the book's setting and Parks' England. The comparisons are thoughtful and often hilarious, particularly the two country's different attitudes on school, religion, medicine and a day at the beach.Parks' wit and dry British humor make this a very enjoyable and fast read. The author use his family as the vehicle to introduce the reader on how Italy raises its children. After reading Parks lovely descriptions of the idiosyncrasies of modern day Italy, I am still unable to discern how much Parks actually admires about how Italy raises its youth."
5,Living in Italy/Italian life,"I have read two of Tim Parks books and have even sent them to my daughter who recently moved to Italy. His books talk about real life things in Italy that she has also encountered.It was enjoyable reading them in succession because I could see how he had been adapting to the new culture and different ways of doing things.A must read for anyone thinking about moving to Italy and a pleasant read for anyone who wants to learn more about the ""real"" country of Italy. It's not the touristy stuff it's the regular people stuff and it's a fun read."
1,A Good Book to Put You To Sleep,"I have read several books in this genre, and this has to be one of the dullest books on the market that deals with life in Italy. I've lived in Italy on two occasions for short periods of time and can't help but wonder - if Mr Parks dislikes Italy so much, why is he still there? He certainly comes across as disliking Italy and Italians. This has none of the humor or whimsy of other similar books. Very disappointing. I should have know better since I also read ""Italian Neighbors"" and was unimpressed by it."
2,Snide and condescending,"The author really doesn't like Italy or the Italians. His first book on Italy was wonderful.Buy that and read it instead. The outlook on thefirst book was one of bemusement and an attemptat understanding; here, he just fears for hischildren (rightfully so). I wish I hadn't read itbecause now I don't like the author as much."
1,BEWARE! Non-standard cables!,"It turns out that this doesn't work like normal KVM switches: it uses special non-standard adapter cables, which apparently aren't necessarily available on amazon.com, or if they are cost a lot. So you can't replace your existing 2-port KVM with this one, for example, and reuse the existing cables. And you may not even be able to use THIS KVM because you may not be able to find the cables you need. This KVM switch only comes with ONE cable to attach to your mouse, keyboard, and video; you have to buy at least two additional cables to make this KVM switch functional.So once you factor in the cost of the extra special-built cables you have to buy (assuming you can even find them), this KVM is VERY expensive. I'm returning mine. It would be nice if the item description bothered to mention the special cable type requirement."
3,Tripp Lite's B006-004-R 4-Port is a better model,"I would agree with the cable shortcomings mentioned by the other reviewers (proprietary, expensive, and not included), and add that Tripp-Lite already offers another better model that does not have this drawback: Tripp Lite B006-004-R 4-Port USB KVM Switch. Uses standard USB KVM cables."
2,KVM needs special cables,"As others have said, you cannot use any other cable. I attempted to use some cables we use for our servers that are of high quality. The video was fine, but would not take input from the Keyboard and mouse.Beware, you must buy their cables.This is a good device otherwise. Works very well. They really need to include cables when purchasing, at least some PS2 cables. They probably excluded cables to keep the price down and suck you in so then you have to go back and get more from them. The Tripp Lite USB cables aren't cheap either."
5,The Always Enchanting Prose of Msgr. Knox,"Such a wonderful, wonderful book! Msgr. Knox's well-written prose is a delight to read, and his insights are well worth the reader's time. The book is literally what its title says -- penetrating, insightful chapters that provide a ""retreat"" at home. Spending time with Msgr. Knox pays dividends both temporally and potentially eternally and is an aesthetic pleasure as a bonus. Msgr. Knox's insight into the human spirit and human condition makes you feel like he is really talking just to you. His chapter entitled ""Today,"" on how and why to live in the present moment of ""today,"" is an example of both the practicality and inspirational aspects of this book. His chapters on facets of Jesus' passion are rich and present aspects I had not thought of. I just wish I could rate this book even higher! Treat yourself to this book! It is one you will want to re-read!"
5,"""Been Mackin For Years and Ain't Fell Off Yet""","This line came from the song ""I'm a playa"", and it holds true. I mean the guy uses the same few rhymes over and over again, but gosh darn it, he holds down as one of the tighest rappers ever. This was one of the few rap CDs that I could push play and let it go. With guest appearences by 2Pac, MC Breed, Freddy B, and Ant Banks, this album was off the hook. I did not think there could be an album to top ""Get in Where You Fit in"" but this came mighty close."
4,TOO SHORT DOES IT AGAIN,"ONCE AGAIN TOO SHORT PUTS OUT A TIGHT CD. TRACK 9 WITH TUPAC AND BREED IS BY FAR THE BEST TRACK ON THE CD BUT THE REST OF THE ALBUM IS ALSO GOOD, COCKTALES AND GIVIN UP THE FUNK ARE TOO SHORT CLASSICS AND GAME WITH FREDDY B IS PRETTY TIGHT."
5,Old School ...,"Too Short , what else can you say? He made music that has an influence on all types of musicians and their styles."
3,Technical Geography not much for culture or location!,"I bought this book as a reference guide for 7th graders. It is well versed in the technical aspects of physical geography and yet has very little on cultural or human elements. I was a little disappointed that there was not more on individual places and people. A good techy reference but not a star in our classroom!'The Idiots Guide to Geography' (I hate the name, because it just gets the students into the name calling attitude.) is more what I needed with more on the culture and history and people. Thanks!"
2,not what I expected,"I thought this book was going to break down what was where in the world for me. Instead, this book covers topics of geopraphy such as maps, climate, population and culture. Perhaps the fault is mine, as I did not read the online description beforehand."
2,broken first disc,I can only review the second disc as the first of two discs was defective and would not play. Our son disappointed and parent felt like a ripoff. Unsure if I would buy more. Second disc was good and has been watched many times
5,victorious,My daughter loves victorious and just like season 1 she loved this one also I would sure recommend anyoneto buy it..
4,Sent to me from heaven....,"This is a fantastic album. I bought it on the recommendation of friends, and I can't get enough of it. Songs like ""Sally Cinnamon,"" ""Made Of Stone,"" ""I Wanna Be Adored,"" and ""Waterfall"" are fantastic. ""She Bangs the Drums"" is my personal favorite. Though a few of the songs are kind of weak, overall this is a great great CD."
3,What else is there to say?,"The Stone ROses created a sound that was uniquely their own. They were on a total and utter mindtrip and wanted to take their audience with them. This video both acknowledges how great they really were but also dispells the mystery that always seemed to surround them. Being a big Stone Roses fan i was immediately struck by how different they sounded live, more subdued. Ian Browns vocals, when not lip syncing to the song, are patchy at best and John Squires guitar seems to be turned right down for many tracks. The video contains television footage but its only towards the end, when this contains any real relevance to the bands music. Their appearance on Top of the pops is contained and shows just how much the Stone Roses could never and would never fit into the established circus called pop music. All in all, an interesting look back at a brilliant band. Sure, its just been put out to make money. But for some its their only chance to see some true musical genius's at work."
4,Cannot be stoned !!!!,"This is a piece of hardware that just makes me realise how lucky I was to witness the birth and death of the most influential bands of my generation. Of all the Roses videos made, this one is by far the most diverse in its mix of good tunes and tidy footage."
5,psychedelic rock at its finest,"Th Stone Roses has their originality by their way of making their music. Their rhythm andsound catches the public ear to be wild and groovy. ""She bangs the drums"" is one of my favorites in the album. Keep it up!"
3,Only for the true believer...,"The thing to remember about this video is that it (along with the Complete Stone Roses cd) is basically an attempt for Silvertone Records to make some more coin off their only successful band ever. The narration is horrible, and it seems that they use the same backdrop for all the videos. Some of it is truly cool, such as when the power goes off during a TV appearance and Ian Brown starts lambasting the announcer, but only a true Roses fan will be satisfied with this video."
2,If your a fan of the band you'll enjoy it.,"The Complete Stone Roses is a video only a true fan will really enjoy. Although it has lots of ""live"" appearances, most of them are lip synched. There are a couple that are truly live and are worth watching. I was a bit disappointed in the lack of interviews. The narriator spoke on and on about how much of a phenomenon they are, he failed to discuss why they disbanded. But nonetheless, a necessary video for a true Stone Roses fan."
5,amazing!,"Love this band, they are so talented. I can't stop playing it. I'm particularly in love with ""Where Angels Play"", just elegant and beautiful."
1,Awful!,"I'm not sure why the other reviewers loved this book so much because I thought it was the worst book I have read in a long time. I hated this book, the main character was horrible and unsympathetic and I don't see how anyone could empathize or identify with her. The plot made no sense, it was confusing, completely unbelieveable, fantasy or not. There were a lot of loose ends that were not explained or tied up. The characters were undeveloped, flat and it was difficult to understand their motivations. Lastly, the plot half way through the book revolved around this mythic ""entity"" that was unexplainable, unbelievable, and frankly did not make the reader care one bit if it was found, understood or proven false. This novel is a complete waste of time...don't buy it."
1,Nice cover.,"But don't judge the book by it. I loved the general storyline, but the author wasn't able to develop it much beyond the book jacket. Unfortunately, this novel's heroine is so holier-than-thou and small-minded that the reader has to be a Mother Theresa to sympathize or even tolerate her. Couldn't wait to put this one down!!"
2,Nice idea...,"Novak does write well, however she's not much of a storyteller. Given the subject matter, one would expect some suspense, some thrills, some atmosphere. There is little to no character development, the characters themselves are static and emotionless, and one cannot develop empathy for any character. The novel was readable, but only because of the writer's skill with the language, not her ability to craft a story. While it could have developed into an intriguing tale of fear, deceit and revenge, it does not, and the ending seems more of an ""easy out"" than either a conclusion or a cliffhanger."
2,Disappointing,"Loving ghost stories, I hoped this would be a great read. But I agree with other reviewers who were turned off by the heroine. And it was confusing and not so much a haunted house tale as a haunted person tale. Looking for a good ghost story? Seek out The Uninvited, Haunting of Hill House, Peregrine's Rest, The Woman in Black, Hell House."
2,"Not bad, but not strong, either","I enjoyed reading Karen Novak's debut novel, and I am interested in reading more of her work. That said, ""Five Mile House"" is a quick engaging read, but leaves much to be desired. The supernatural connection between the main character and the narrator never becomes clear, and the plot has way too many holes and is a bit too outlandish for easy acceptance. I don't want to beat this horse to death as there are already so many reviews, so let me just leave you my suggestion: check the book out at the library before you buy. It's likable, but not one I'd read again."
3,neo-gothic,"Five Mile House, a story within a story, hooked my interest from page one and sustained it until the end. Karen Novak is a skilled writer who knows how to breathe life into characters via dialogue, description, and ambience. It is interesting to note that, unlike most literary apparitions and spirits, this ""ghost"" doesn't know her own mind, her intentions evolving with the rest of the action. The plot, revolving around 2 parallel lives separated by 100 years but linked by themes of guilt, retribution, manipulation, and possible madness, is well conceived, but there are some problems with its execution. Confusion remains about the motivation of the antagonists and the reality of the secret, perhaps because, as some other reviewers have suggested, a sequel is in the works. Relationships in this book are also somewhat muddily defined and iffy. Were it not for these flaws, I would have rated Five Mile a four or maybe even a five. Definitely thought provoking and rather noir in a modern way."
2,Didn't hold my interest,"The blurb for this novel held my interest more than the book. Former cop, Leslie, recovering from a break down, moves with her husband and two young daughters to a cottage in the sleepy town of Wellington, while her husband Greg restores the old mansion with a tragic past that's haunted with mystery.What I liked: The writer has a pleasant style. The premise for the story was exciting.What I didn't like- Most of the characters were more stereotype than lacking depth or personality. The story structured in a way that bored me and I found myself skipping ahead. At 50% on my kindle app, I skimmed ahead to the end. I wouldn't have finished had I not wanted to read the next book, INNOCENCE.I think this writer has potential. Ghost stories aren't my favorite genre, so someone else might be more interested in the book.2.5 out of 5"
3,Resolution lacking,"Novak's writing is top-notch but the resolution leaves some important questions. The book is *almost* good enough to re-read to see if I missed some important clues, but I don't think it's my problem. A good editor would have asked Novak to explain or resolve a few things.When a plot is as twisty and convoluted as this one, the loose ends need to be tied up. Maybe there was no summation in Five Mile House because the plot *didn't* hold together. Let the readers think they just didn't get it -- yeah, that'll work.Why were the prostitutes poisoned? Why were Eleanor's children murdered? Why did Leslie leave her children unattended after being warned they were in danger? I'd ask many other questions but doing so would spoil the book for others.Novak is an excellent writer and parts of this book were very effective, but it doesn't make up for the very unsatisfying resolution."
3,'Five Mile House' Doesn't Quite Go the Distance,"Unlike the other readers above, I found the plot-line here confusing and the characters' motivations unclear. Many of the suspenseful complications introduced during the story were NEVER cleared up (what about the answer to little Amy's question, 'is he here?"", for example?), making this story ultimately unsatisfying. Hopefully Novak's next will focus less on atmosphere and more on the demands of a compelling, complete mystery. She DOES write well."
5,GREAT story...,"Another page turner that kept me up all night, even after I'd finished the book. Excellent first novel, can't wait to read more from the author. Her characters are well-developed and interesting. There's a lot I loved about this story but I don't want to give it away in my review. Trust me on this one, you'll want to be surprised and kept on the edge of your seat."
1,why after one cd?,"Give me a break.The band is terrible and it doesn't matter who's playing on it.John is a great singer but not here,not with those songs.Bruce can't play rock or metal he's a session guy and always will be.The two other guys well if you saw the band live it's far to be a driving machine the drummer is very very green and not very good and the bass player is washed-up.If you want a live album buy something else.Plus it's the same songs as the first and only cd so why ? Money ? Probably learned it from Kiss !"
4,KISS wishes it sounded this good with Peter and Ace,"The last reviewer obviously isn't a Union fan, maybe some Kiss fan who needed something else. Wny not a live album when they have switched record labels and put the finishing touches on a new album?!?!?! Bruce Kulick is a metal guitarist and shows just how good he can be out from the KISS shadow....He was held back there and now, given the opportunity, shows that he is one of the elite guitarist in rock today.....Corabi and the band move thru their set list with ease, while nothing out of the ordinary except a longer version of Jungle and I Walk Alone, still kicks major butt. I continue to listen to this CD constantly and I have had it over a month now, and I really am glad to see two guys (Corabi and Kulick) break out with this band and have two great rhythm guys (Fitz, Hunting) to do it with.....It's worth the buy....."
4,Haunting and beautiful!!,"This CD is amazing - if you haven't seen the movie, it will make you want to see it. ""Deliver Me"" by the wonderful Sarah Brightman alone will make you want to rush out and rent it. There are lots of gems on this album, including the opening track, Silence, with vocals by Sarah McLaughlin. This song, that was in the trailer for the movie, drove me absolutely nuts and I could not rest until I found it. On to covering The Clash, a brave venture in itself, which was done wonderfully by the Solar Twins. What a fun song!! All in all, I'd say that this is a well-rounded CD and one that any music fan would thoroughly enjoy!!"
5,Amazing,"Wow! I would definitely recommed this CD to anyone. I like all kinds of music from hip hop to pop to rap and alternative, but this is by far my favorite CD. Its hard to find something like this. It has a haunting, exotic sound mixed with lighter tunes with a hint of pop. I love the movie and I'm addicted to this CD. I can't go anywhere without bringing it."
4,great soundtrack,"'Silence' is haunting and beautiful,'Party's just Begun' is catchy and fun, 'Damaged' is touching, 'Deliver Me' is emotional and powerful...all of the songs on this album are incredible, ok with the exception of two which I dont listen to, but this is a great CD..."
4,enthralling,"a wonderful selection of music which truly connects you to the emotions in the movie. i do, however, wish the soundtrack would have provided sarah mclachlan with some amount of credit for the song ""silence"" ... this is a great mixture of music to introduce listeners to the less mainstream, great sound, that is out there and to go with the collection of mixes for underground listeners. i wasn't old enough to remember but was taken to a concert where pj harvey opened for bob dylan."
5,BROKEDOWN PALACE THE MOVIE WITH DANES AND BECKINSALE,BROKEDOWN PALACE IS A GREAT MOVIE. I SAW IT THE MOVIE THEATER TWICE BECAUSE I'M A BIG FAN OF CLAIRE DANES SINCE ROMEO & JULIET CAME OUT IN TO THEATERS IN 1996. SO I GIVE THIS MOVIE TWO THUMBS UP. SO I WILL BE GETTING THIS MOVIE WHEN COMES TO STORES TO BUY. AND THE SOUNDTRACK IS GOOD I LOVE IT.
5,The music really brings the movie home,"Wow, one of the main reasons why this movie was so moving was probably the music. This soundtrack really captures the emotions of the characters and the music is haunting and exciting all at once. I love it so much!"
4,This is a great CD!,"There are a few songs I don't like, but I really like the rest! Notably, the best are definetly Sarah Brightman's Deliver Me, which is such a great song, and even better at where it was placed in the movie... And the score by David Newman, those are just a few! Get this CD!"
4,Good soundtrack!,"Good soundtrack to a great movie. Much of the music type on the soundtrack isn't what I normally listen to, but it does have some good songs on it."
2,bethlehem star,"Although the star was very beautiful, it was defective. The top point of the star was warped and fanned out. Very disappointing."
3,From Opera to Soaps?,"Remember the movie, 7 Brides for 7 Brothers? Well, Nathan Gunn gives that kind of performance. He's the kind of singer/actor that could really cross over pretty easily from Opera to Soaps or old school broadway productions. This album is a little dry if you're not a hard core Opera fan, but if you need a little somber in your life, this would be perfect. I made the mistake of listening to Andre Bocelli first. Mr. Gunn would never be able to fill those shoes, but is very good at delivering his personal best. Technically perfect, but lacking the passion and flare of Bocelli, which can't be learned."
2,Not crazy about this one,"I wasn't crazy about this one. I absolutely love ""Just Before Sunrise"", but this one is just annoying. He has an incredible baritone voice, but the piano accompaniment and the song selection . . . Buy ""Just Before Sunrise"". It's incredible!"
5,A wonderful collection of songs magnificently performed.,A wonderful collection of songs magnificently performed. Mr. Gunn is the up and coming baritone to watch.
3,"Great Voice, heavy artsongs","Nathan has a gorgeous, rich voice which suits this tall, handsome singer. But material is too art song heavy, often lugubrious. And I never heard such a draggy Shall We Gather at the River. I'm waiting for a happier CD from this baritone. Mallory"
4,nathan gunn/american anthem review,"Nathan Gunn shares with us his warm and rich focused tone. His diction is quite good and his versatility is very nice. As a baritone I find myself listening very carefully and I think that it is quite a wonderful talent. The CD itself is very good and is, for the most part, very pleasing to listen to. There are some choices of literature that I do not care for but that is a very subjective statement. There are some high notes that are rather acceptional and there is one that is not, but only one. That being said, it is still quite good, comparably. This CD has inspired me to try lit from this CD that I have purchased and will start soon."
2,Too little way too late,You have to read through over 250 pages leading up to about 30 pages of what I was looking for in the first place: action and some suspense.You could just skip the first couple hundred pages and get right to the real story. Excellent book for the readers digest version without really missing anything.Also all the political discussions came across as so phony that it really hurt any sence of reality.
3,Definitely not Cold Choices,"I am happy that I heard Cold Choices audio first, otherwise I probably would not have finished this book. Like others, I am a huge sub fan & was so thrilled to find Larry Bond's series when I just happened to pick up Cold Choices at the library.What didn't deliver in this book were the technical descriptions of everything in the sub. I could hardly follow the storyline (what there was of it) because the details were so boring...but I did want to learn of the characters after Cold Choices.I think Bond could flesh out his characters a bit more, but maybe that will happen in the future. Course I don't want every detail about them...just a little background.I recommend this book to those who really enjoy submarines as I think you will learn more than you ever have before....unless you have served on one."
3,rogerb@spacecenter.org,"A good ""one-mission"" book well told. An enjoyable summer action read where the good guys win, the bad guys lose, none of the good guys get hurt and the hero wins the heart of the girl who keeps falling down and spraining her ankle. What more could you ask for?"
1,Snooze fest,"This was the most boring book I've read in recent memory. Don't let the title or the cover summary fool you. This book is not about some great submarine adventure. This book is about the career path, and day to day life of a Junior Naval Officer onboard a submarine. There is no contact with any enemy submarines until the last chapter or two. Even then, it was not very uneventful. Read if you need a sleeping pill. It worked for me."
3,3 1/2 stars -- good but not great,"Having read and enjoyed several other novels by Bond, I quickly picked up Dangerous Ground when it came out. With previous works primarily centered around large geopolitical conflicts and ground war action, this was Bonds first time venturing into the realm of navel engagement, specifically regarding submarines. Although I liked Dangerous Ground, I can't say that it was as good as Red Phoenix or Vortex. Dangerous Ground, while providing a solid story and a compelling look at the undersea world, lacked the gut-wrenching intensity and massive geopolitical issues that filled previous works. I put this work in the category of ""good but not great."""
5,On target!,"Terminal Run finds the United States Battle Network compromised by a covert group of hackers. This eliminates the advantage of real time intel.Washington fears that the USS Snarc (a robot submarine) has been hijacked as well and sends the Piranha to sink her.If that isn't bad enough, Britain, India and Red China are squaring up for a show down in the Indian Ocean.This is a fast paced, well researched and well written story. Those of you familiar with the series will see Mike Pacino's son in action and for those of us who still believe carrier battle groups are more than targets, Dimercurio provides carrier based action as well.This a great read. I read most of it on a car trip on my way to Norfolk. Highly recommended."
4,Good but not perfect!,"I did a pretty thorough research on 17"" and 20"" LCD TVs. Like the Samsung LTN1735, it is a very nice TV. However, I'd prefer 1735 than this one because you can't make it sit straight up--it inlcines backward---like the Sharp E1U or EsomethingU. When I sit on the sofa to watch TV (I am a short person) I have to raise my head all the time.My ranking according to my personal preference of the 17"" 20"" LCD TVs are as follows:1. Samsung LTN2. Sharp Aquos B4U3. Toshiba4. Dell 1700 / Batesias VMT2015. Sharp E1UHaven't tried others. There certainly are better ones out there and you just need to do a little researchSome people don't like the Batesias for its average PC pic. But I feel OK. But ultimately wife bought the LTN 1765...personal preference!"
3,Alessi Bowl,The bowl was attractive however was not as large as I had anticipated. I returned it and was refunded promptly.
5,Works perfectly! Good quality.,"These rings were exactly what we were looking for and couldn't find at office supply retailers. The quality is great, the price is right and the service was excellent."
5,all left behind series,"Im on #8 & I've enjoyed everyone of the series. I honestly didn't enjoy reading, until I started reading these books. Now I cann't wait to get to the end of each book & get started on the next one. They are really worth your time to read them. And if you know Reverlations some, its evan better!!!!"
3,The Mark,"So Nicolae is back- raised from the dead and now the world is good and ready to bow down to him. Most of the world, anyway. For the Tribulation Force, life continues to become harder as they resist Carpathia's ""one world"" religion and government...and the mark that all people must receive to buy or sell. Resistance means death.So now we're to the point where things are really getting bad. And stressful. Of course, if you've gotten this far in the Left Behind series, The Mark won't be much worse for the characters than in the other six books. But be prepared anyway!"
2,Did Wotrk For Me,"Maybe I am not suited for this product. It was hard to set up and really never worked. Should have asked my money back. But the, it may be just me."
5,A Must Read for Security Trainers,"This work takes the reader by the hand and illustrates to them what a successful training program should be. The author presents military training tactics and demonstrates how they apply to corporate security training. This work also includes an in depth analysis of recent events that can be used to train a security staff. I have found this manual to be a great tool,by providing fresh ideas to enhance my training program."
4,"Good product,could be easier to assemble","Overall very good, but assembly could be easier, takes a while.Still, it is highly recommended."
2,Synthetic Scent,"This book reeks (pun intended) of warped teenage sentimentality and middle-aged male perversion. It might appeal to a teen as provocatively profound and disturbing. (Hmm a Nirvana song is based on it.) It might appeal to those whose fetishes tend toward violence. For the rest of us, the story tries so hard to be bizzare in an artistic sort of way that it ends up being monotonous. Parts of the book really drag. The end is more comical than harrowing. The end is just too fantastical. The characters are like deaf mutes on sedatives. There is no reason to believe in, care for or justify the main character.You'd get red in the cheeks if you had to tell your Mother about this book you just read. She'd know immediately that the emperor has no clothes.The author tried to make literature but he ended up with a cartoon, granted a cartoon set in an interesting time and place (hence the 2 stars), but a color cartoon nonetheless."
1,You've got to be kidding,"A great book? It seems almost unreadable to me. Sure, the scent aspect was interesting - for about 20 pages. Despite putting in numerous hours attempting to make progress in it, I have have found nothing in the plot or characters of Perfume to devote any more time to it. There are so many interesting books out there; I did not find this to be one of them."
2,not as good as everybody else says it is,the freak'n book's got almost no damn dialoge. The guy tells the story asw a straight narrative and itgets borring after the first part.
4,Not Like Any Perfume You'd Ever Want,"This is a wonderfully articulate book about an olfactory mutant with a decadent morality(or amorality) in 18th century France. This man knows everything by his sense of smell.His name in French is 'Frog'. Interestingly, he gives off no smell himself. He is shunnedby others.Alternately amusing and gruesomely disgusting, this is a wonderful book."
2,Well.... not so terribly remarkable...,"Convinced by glowing reviews I bought and read this book. I agree that it's well written, and the author describes the 18th century French countryside provocatively, but the story and the characters in it are portrayed with little depth or feeling. Granted, it's a challenging exercise to fully craft a book whose entire premise is based on the power of scent. Unfortunately, that's all I came away with. If you're really interested, go to the library."
5,Really horrifying!!,"What can I say? I've read so many comments on this book - and what do I feel about it? I read Perfume before I read the latest novels by Süskind (Pigeon, The story about Mr.Sommer). And after reading these novels, Perfume in some way changed. Süskind is a strange writer - and a genious. Perfume is a horrifying book - quite simply horrifying. It's like nothing else I've read. I just FELT the book. Can't say anything else. Really. If you haven't read it yet: Please do. You'll love it - ore hate it."
4,A must read,"I would've given this read 5 stars had it not been for the childish ending. With that said, this is a must read. There are but a few literary works that allow the words on the pages to transcend and effortlessly tell a story. 'Perfume' is surely one of them. Creative, inventive, poetic, humorous, and without any hesitation, adventurous."
3,interesting but......,"An interesting, rich and original book but I just didn't understand where it was going, it just seemed to go on and on and on and then it came to a violent stop......wasn't sure what to think. I would've liked to see a purpose an underlying point the book was getting to but there wasn't."
3,"Strange, Strange and More Strange","I must say that I am intrigued by the concept of this book. The book reminds me of several of the bizarre books I read in French lit class in school, and a bit of the Hunchback of Notre Dame, as the style and society outcast thing is similar. I would recommend the book for a rainy day, although I wasn't mesmerized, I was intrigued (and I did find myself noticing smells more). However, I can't understand why everyone else was raving so much about the book."
2,o.k. book. avoid unless you are really really bored,"it's really not very good. had some promise at the beginning, but it fell apart."
1,Extremely overrated,"I have no problem with bizarre. I have no problem with surreal. I like scary and creepy and disturbing. This was merely pointless, at its best--it was profoundly sexist at its worst. Excruciatingly long descriptions of scent--page after page after page of them. All to prop up the most undeveloped protagonist (villain) I have ever encountered. And no review I have read thus far has even commented on the absolutely perverse mysogyny of the premise: that teenage virgin girls produce/exude the scent which will control and subdue all of humanity if they are killed and the scent can be captured. Suskind develops this atrocious idea without a trace of critique or irony whatsoever. This book was pretentious and the author's self-satisfaction was more overpowering than any civet or rose water could ever be. A disgrace."
3,interesting but not riveting,I'm not sure what to think of this book. It was definitely interesting in its vivid description of Paris and various places in France. The imagery that the author used was fantastic and really made you feel as if you were there. I did not really enjoy the story and plot. I didn't really think it was that entertaining even with the crazy ending....I would say skip this book unless you really enjoy reading about stories that took place in France.
4,"Gripping, yet still grasping for something finer","Perfume, as a novel, flowed very nicely, and contained gripping descriptions and plot devices. Despite a somewhat strange start, the book easily begins to propel itself, and the reader will find themselves always trying to finish just one more chapter, one more, etc. However, while the novel is well crafted in that respect, it is lacking in two major areas.First of all, there is an unjustified power given to the olfactory senses. While the explanations are solid, you'll find yourself rolling your eyes from time to time at the absurdity, and abuse of the protaganists ability.Second of all, you may come out of this novel with a slight feeling of emptiness. While it does touch upon some ideas of human motivation and behavior, it doesn't flesh them out enough. I had great difficult extracting solid conceptual ideas from this piece of literature.Grade: 8/10"
5,One of a Kind,"Sometimes, when you finish the last page of a book you suddenly realize that you'll never find another book quite like it. I had that same experience with Lord of the Flies. My only consolation is that I can read it again and again."
3,"Niet slecht, maar het kan toch nog stukken beter","Het Parfum is geen slecht boek, maar fantastisch zou ik het toch niet noemen. Dit boek is redelijk saai in het begin en komt slechts zeer traag op gang. Eens dat het een beetje spannender wordt, begint het boek mee te vallen en dankzij een spannend einde groeit dit boek toch uit tot een goed boek. Dit boek moet het toch vooral hebben van de goede recensies op het boek zelf, zodat ook niet-genteresseerde personen dit boek gaan lezen. Toch is dit geen aanrader van mijn kant"
2,Hmmm,"Perfume was recommended to me as the best book ever written. Quite frankly, although Perfume got off to an auspicious start and made me think about my olfactory senses (previously ignored), I couldn't wait for it to end. It's a horrible story and Suskind seemed fed up with it himself towards the end of the book."
5,A book that smells very good,"What an amazing book! I had never read a story that explored the sense of smell this way. The author makes a terrific work in transmitting the different perfumes of things. You can actually smell his descriptions.About the plot, all I will say is that Grenouille, the main character, is a man that has developed an amazing nose and an extraordinary memory of odours. But his greed to retaing perfumes will drive him to dark places... Definitely is worth reading."
4,Coming of Age with a twist,"While this book starts out a little slowly, it definitely picks up the pace with a shocking climax at the end. Suskind explores themes of love, power, society's responsibility to the indiviual's self-worth, and the god-like qualities of the underman.Grenouille possesses a super-human sense of smell while lacking his own scent. He spends his entire life trying to capture the one scent that fills him with desire and figures out a way to use that scent to gain the love and power he has longed for his whole life. His journey of self-discovery does not lead to the fairy-tale ending of enlightenment, but to the realization that he is incapable of the one emotion he both scorns and desires--love."
3,Not satisfied with its packaging.,"This is a great book, I already knew that before buying but I gave only three stars because the box/envelope used to ship the book damaged the item. The box has a flap which is slipped inside to close it, when it was slipped inside it caught some of the pages and cover of the book damaging them permanently. Someone was in a hurry when packaging this item.Other than that it was a good experience (as usual) with Amazon Prime."
3,fascinating - but not in love,a little bit too surreal / wannabe real for me - tries hard to make sense of a made up sick person - would not recommend it
2,Imaginative imagery - bizarre story,"This book was very bizarre. It was recommended by a friend who said it was her favorite book of all time. I honestly couldn't wait until it was over and I almost stopped reading before page 50. A soulless, scentless perfumer in 18th century France becomes a serial killer in order to extract the unique scents of his victims and create the ultimate perfume. The point of the book (if there is one at all) is that human beings are nothing more than easily manipulated animals, victims of our own instincts and physical desires, and that our arrogance of anthropological superiority is an illusion."
2,Hard to stay awake,"I was really excited to read this book when I first heard about it, as I thought that it was a very different and interesting concept. Unfortunately I found it hard to stay awake for more than two pages. I understand that when writing about the world of smell that a lot of description is necessary to give the reader an accurate sense of what the author is trying to portray, but this book goes on, sometimes for two pages, describing one smell or picture that could have been adequately summed up in one paragraph. I found myself skimming over pages until the author stopped with his excessive descriptions and finally started to move on with the story.There were some very interesting pieces, but overall I didn't enjoy this book all that much and was actually annoyed when I read the ending. If anything the ending makes you feel as though the book was a complete waste of time - in addition to a Very Odd chapter towards the end - just plain wierd and unbelievable."
1,Not exciting,"I don't know why everyone was so excited about this book. I read the German book and I finished it in one day - because I tried to figure out why it was said to be so good.I missed a character I could identify myself with - I did not care about any of the characters, so I found it really boring."
2,It had such potential....,"I think this story of the ultimate misfit could have been a 'must read.'However, the author fails to use Jean-Baptiste Grenouille's sad story for more than just that -- a sad story -- and misses a wonderful opportunity to teach his readers a lesson.To say anymore would be giving away too much, but just to suffice it to say I believe Jean-Baptiste's 'gift' is wasted...as is this story.The imagery is so right on as to pull the reader into olfactory oblivion....it's just a shame the author fails to use his gift for much more than a 'sensational' ending that leaves the reader wondering WHY?There was a missed opportunity here. Too bad."
3,Weird Trip,"Perfume is a wonderful, vibrant, very different, and creepy book about a man with the world's most amazing nose for scents. What drives this man, as he lives in 18th Century France during the Enlightenment, is something that will make your flesh crawl. Suskind has one of the best writing styles I have ever read. It is a pleasure to read.The main character is one of the most repulsive, disgusting characters in literature. Yet he has the most amazing gift.After this book, you will never look at perfume the same way again. Translated from the German."
2,Forgettable,"The Perfume was a huge hit among my circle of friends while I was in high school. It seemed everyone was reading it. I came across it quite late but I wouldn't have missed anything if I had never read it. It starts promisingly when the child without a smell is born in filth in 18th century Paris, but before the first half is finished, it becomes uninteresting and tedious. The author employs a narrative style, there is almost no dialogue and in my opinion it is more suited to a longish short story than to a novel. I am ok with the main character not being identifiable but I didn't find him interesting enough to be repulsed by him either. The middle parts of the book are nothing more than a way to fill the pages and the character development is poor. The end is totally meaningless and ridiculous. Maybe the problem with the book is that it is never beliveable, not even as a fantasy.I cannot comment on the language as I have read a Turkish translation."
2,Forgettable,"I just don't get all the great reviews. The writing was good, but the story was lacking. The smells were better developed than the characters. Not only did the main character have no soul, but the book had no soul."
3,Uneven but good prose,"Started out beautifully but seemed to change unexpectantly from section to section. Areas that should have been important were glossed over in my opinion while superfluous sections got many pages. Almost like different people were writing each new section. The lack of narrative confounded me in trying to flesh out Grenoille. I'm going to a book discussion tomorrow night about ""pPrfume"" - very interested in what my group will say. I don't think anyone will be middle of the road on this one..."
4,sumptous reading,"beautifully written tale of a monster-man, an evil genius, inhuman in lacking a scent of his own, superhuman in his olfactory abilites, sumptously rendered for all its grim horror. It only lacks a fifth star because of a narrative flaw, the story fades out in anticlimax like its sinister superhero"
4,The Fragrance of Language,"Beautifully written with a language that is fragrance at its best, translating olfactory sensations into the written word. Perhaps a bit overwrought and sometimes overdrawn, nevertheless ... the work is an accomplishment that defies narrative rules and a feast for all the senses."
5,"sensual, creative and brilliant","""Perfume"" is a creative, well-written, erudite and sensual work of literature. The author demonstrates a dark sardonic sense of humor that I really enjoyed. I found the character of the main protagonist, Grenouille, to be absolutely fascinating, and was captivated by the story. I'm looking forward to reading more of Patrick Suskind's work."
5,The smell of talent.,"What a great entry in the world of classic literature. Nowadays it is hard to write an original love story. Shakespeare did it all. However, there is more than love between man and woman. The Perfume is the proof. Patrick Suskind shows us the beatitude of or most unspoken fear: our smell. He created a man, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, whose nose drove him to obsession and murder. Forever he will be a monster in the eyes of the reader. I wonder. Is passion not only for the good?"
3,Strange,"this book was very engrossing and a fairly fast read. I actually threw it away when I was finished with it, which I can't remember ever doing with a book. I either keep my books or give them away. I found this book to be quite disturbing, and one that stuck with me in a most unpleasant way. The book gets 3 stars because of the writing style, but I could not bring myself to pass it on to another reader."
4,"The violence is thematic, not gratuitous","A delicately brutal investigation into an abnormal mind, this bookwas surprisingly easy to read. There was a grotesque poetry in thecharacter. Another book you might enjoy if you are intrigued byabnormal psychology (and one that, although it was completelydifferent in style, is thought-provokingly similar in subject matter)is the noir classic _The Killer Inside Me_, by Jim Thompson"
2,"All sizzle, no steak.",I expected more of this book. It is long on flowery prose and short on dramatic action. It is also more than a little implausible. This book was written for those who find Anne Rice too tough on the stomache.
3,Can you smell 'Tedium'?,"This is, indeed, an interesting read but better suited, I think, to a short story. The book is short on plot and devoid of basic characterizations. It is all about intense olfactory descriptions that, frankly, I found pretty tedious after awhile. At one point the main character spends seven years in a cave with no communication with the outside world. I, too, felt a stifling claustrophobia and couldn't wait to be through with the book. I appreciate the author's inventiveness but be warned that this is not a typical historical novel."
1,Boring,"boring, no climax at all, a very weak ending, almost none dialogues, a ridiculous main character ( the murderer ), a wry style of writing. And people say this is good .. GO figure ..."
1,I would not recommend,I did not like this book. I thought the imagery was interesting but I did not enjoy the storyline and it was nothing like I expected. I was on vacation and had nothing else to read and that's the only reason I finished the book.
3,i feel like i was tricked,"This was a book club book, so I grabbed it and got reading, not without checking the Amazon reviews first.I'm being generous with 3 stars because conceptually this is a great book. But I was so thoroughly disappointed with the ending that I think the rest of the reviewers read something else. It was so disappointing, and a bit ridiculous, especially for having been led through a somewhat realistic story for the first 85% of the book."
2,well written,"I have to say that this was a frustrating read. There is no doubt that its well written, the narrative was great. It feels as if you're there, I could see what the writer was describing perfectly. The big letdown for me was the story. I read this book because a couple of friends of my decided to form a little book club and choose this as our first pick and I have 2 say that we all had a hard time finishing it. We thought that because it is a relatively short book it would take us 3, maybe 4 weeks to give us time to read calmly and meet in between to discuss the book so far but it took us longer. It kept making me sleepy everytime I would pick it up.The story just didn't do it for me. It felt kind of pointless and like I said, even though it was very well written, the subject just seemed like a waste."
4,Scent as sense,"The text is dense, and after I was only a third of the way through I received another book in the mail that I was eager to read, so I was in a hurry to finish it. But this is a well-written book. The author is very good in his use of images, and the way he shows the normal people of the world to be as ugly in their love as Grenouille is in his hate. I'm not sure I agree with the story's premise about the all-consuming power of scent, but I still recommend this book. It is not a light read, but if you're in the mood for something a little bit weighty, this is definitely an interesting ride."
4,"enjoyable, educational","Ah! Strong, unusual plot; imperfect main character; imaginative phrasing; and minutely drawn historical detail. I was frightened at one point to enter a section of about 50 pages that I thought would completely end my interest, hence the 4 star rating. Thank goodness for the strong rebound. Especially recommended for serial murder enthusiasts."
1,Pretentious Drivel,"The novel has such a distasteful plot and the main character, but it could have redeemed itself somehow had it been well written. However, that is not the case here. There is a ton of information thrown in about odors and perfumes and I really get nothing from that; it looks to me that Suskind was just trying to make up for not being that good of a writer. Also, if an author sets off writing a historical novel, he is bound to create the color of the era and from numerous other novels we can see that the eighteenth-century France is nothing like what is described here."
1,"Bizarre, and very boring","It took me over two months to finish this book. Obviously some serious research went into the perfume-making part, but otherwise much of the historical and geographical detail is wrong. This would be nothing if it were a compelling read. It is not. The protagonist, Grenouille, is empty. I did not like him, love him, hate him, admire him, despise him, fear him. Quite an achievement for a serial killer to manage to be so bland. I did not feel sorry for his victims either.In fact, I did not feel anything for any of the characters. But maybe that was the author's point."
1,WHY THE FUSS?,"One of the dumbest books I've evere read.Bought it because of the 5 star reviewsby others. For those who have not readthis book, you'll save a lot of time bystarting to read from page 200."
5,Classic,"I would put this book in the category of a classic. It is chilling, memorable and frightening. Suskind is a story telling master. I could not put the book down. Some people I've recommended it to cannot understand why I think it's so very good, but I stand by my feelings: it is a masterpiece."
2,"try, try again","I really wanted to like this book, which has been so highly recommended by so many readers, so I gave it two wholehearted attempts. This second time, I made it to the halfway point. Grenouille is a character so damaged, twisted, repulsive, and pathetic, that it would have been a great blessing had he died at birth. I would go so far as to classify him as sub-human. He certainly can be described as freakish. The other characters are not as dysfunctional, but there isn't an individual in this book that isn't thoroughly selfish. If you don't mind reading about psychological grotesquerie, Perfume is a well-written novel that could be intriguing. Not my cup of tea, I'm afraid."
2,strange,This is a strange book but worth reading if for no other reason than the time frane in which it is set. I'm really curious what the movie will be like
3,A Formula; For What?,"This is an easy-to-read, well liked novel; the author sticks to a simple, compelling formula and doesn't let things get complicated. The comments of Jamie Bower in August 2007 and ""A Customer"" in May 2003 were about right: Perfume is essentially a short story.It reads like an allegory with echoes of Zarathustra, Dracula, Frankenstein, Hugo, Dumas (Monte Cristo), and goodness knows what. I don't know German language literature very well so I'm not sure what else besides Nietzche Suskind (writing in German) has going. There's not enough characterization to inspire any particular interpretation of the allegory in my mind.Think Rocky Horror Picture Show."
4,well done period murder piece with a bizarre twist,"A quick read, it's more like a short story than a full length novel.But it's so quirky and different you won't be able to put it down.I haven't yet seen the movie, but I can imagine it being pretty interesting, I hope they do the period well.Smells. Stenches, and stinks are the stars of this story. I resisted more alliteration there.My only quibble with it is that the ""action"" of the book is glossed sort of rapidly. I feel like Suskind lost his momentum and squished the last half of the book into a much condensed version.PLUS for a murder mystery there are some very humorous and ironic patterns that form. I won't give them away, but I started to EXPECT certain happenstances for each character the murderer came into contact with.Still, it'll probably forever change the way you view perfumes."
1,Meaningless waste of time and paper,"This is a ridiculous book. I bought on based on the reviews that I read here. This book lacks substance, a plot, a story and is incredibly boring. A total and utter waste of time. Save your time and money by avoiding this book."
1,It really smells!,"Well, I guess I'm in the minority. There are few books that I dislike, but this is one of them. Ususally bizarre twists, characters, etc. are my cup of tea...but this is more than I can handle. Grenouille (""frog legs"") should have been left in the fish bucket. There were no events, characters, or places to enjoy or like or feel empathy toward. Yes, we got to know Grenouille well - too well - but no empathy or sympathy materialized for him. The perfume industry discriptions were interesting and I will certainly think twice before I apply one in the future."
2,What a waste,"This book is a waste of time, trees, paper and money, let's begin:The first part of the book is more or less regular, with that in mind and that the book has 400 pages or so and it could be written in less than 50 we will continue.The book goes out of the main story so many times that you really don't know which was that story, I would throw this book to the waste basket but this book wasn't mine so at least I didn't waste my money.The end of the book is just pathetic.P.S. I put two stars to this book because I know what is writing a book and just for writing it it has two stars."
1,One way to start a fire,"The best thing to do with this book is use it for kindling. I found this book in a give away pile at my college and saw that it received good reviews. Then, after trudging through it, I realized that I should have left it there. It starts off interesing, but fell drastically short of the expectations I had."
4,Best book ever!,"arrived in a timely fashion, even though I had the lowest shipping possible. the cover was damaged worse than the description lead on to, but because the book is so awesome, it doesn't make that much of a difference."
4,The audacious opening isn't sustained,"This is an original and enjoyable read, but most of the best writing is concentrated in the Parisian episodes. The book is entertaining from the first page to the last, but after the fall of the House of Baldini, the novel drifts in search of an ending. Many of the sub plots in the latter half seem like space fillers rather than a continuation of the brilliant opening chapters. Uneven, but funny, clever and highly recommended."
4,Macabre but not gory,"What an unusual concept for book, this story of a man obsessed by capturing the ultimate perfume.The book is very descriptive of 18th century settings in France and the lead character's incredible ability to recognize, save and catalogue every scent he has ever encounterd. Each of the characters has selfish motivations for their actions, which all come together in this highly unusual taleI expected to book to be more violent and gory than it actually is. Most of the violence occurs in the background, so the heart of the book is focused on the murderer's various schemes and methods of capturing scent. This asexual murderer uses scents to unconsciously control the people around him and methodically create his ultimate perfume.Thought provoking and unsettling, but very well written. I admire the translator's work as well, it is never heavy handed."
4,Very Original,The book starts by overblowing the character we are about to meet but once that is over it settles down into a really original piece of storytelling. At some points the language is not what we would expect for 18th century France but I imagine that this results from the translation from the German.For such a great story - it is always impossible to end it in the way it has proceeded. This distracts in a minor way from the impact but only to a minor extent.
5,simply outstanding,Fantastic !! I first read perfume 7 years ago and I still rate it as the best book I have ever read. I always recommend it when books come into the conversion. I love it.
5,Unpredictable roller-coaster ride,"Interestingly, my reading group (of around 12 people)all had a strong reaction to the book. Most of them hated it intensely, two refused to finish it. I myself loved it (as have a couple of friends). Still, almost everyone in the reading group gave it five stars for its value as a discussion tool. Those who hated it seemed morally outraged, offended. Loving the book made me feel as though I was a deviant. All I can say in my defense is that I found the character so fictitious, so unreal and ""larger than life"" that I couldn't feel offended. Grenouille is a characature. I even found the book quite humorous, but most of all I enjoyed Suskind's use of language. Every sentence seemed perfect despite it being a tranlation."
4,Kudos,"Let's not forget to note the accomplishment of the translator, John E. Woods, who made for those of us, who were not able to read the story in its original language, a very effective and easy read. He chose the best possible words to describe what the author wanted us to know."
3,Perfume,"The start of the book is extraordinary. Its descriptions of Paris and its people are so vivid and well researched that I sometimes read a chapter or two to my students of French. Unfortunately, the story slows down and I find myself skipping several chapters to get to the end. Too bad because it has such a great start."
5,The most pleasant smelling murder ever,"To be able to imagine, every scent on every page of this book, was incredible. Thank god, it wasn't a scatch and sniff book. (LOL) BRILLIANCE,SHEER BRILLIANCE...I have never experienced such a desire and passion for a book"
4,recommended,"This book makes a great read; innovative in the way it focuses on the sense of smell and mesmerizing in its detailed descriptions. However the actual murders came pretty much too late in the story and seemed to be quite rushed in the narrative. Still, the final chapters are quite haunting and make a fine climax. Maybe I can't give this one 5 stars because I was still under the impression of the earth-shattering book I had read just before this (Jose Saramago's <Blindness>, to be specific - a must-read!) but I think most people will enjoy <Perfume> immensely; even if you don't you'll appreciate the innovational aspects."
5,Una Obra Maestra del suspenso,"antes que nada, pensé que hacía falta una reseña de ""el Perfume"" en español. Este libro es cautivante desde la primera página. La historia de una voluntad sin igual, un ser con una tenacidad asombrosa, carente de falsas moralidades, de remordimientos innecesarios, dispuesto a hacer lo que sea con tal de conseguir sus objetivos. El personaje central, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, es descrito con maestría por Süskind, como un ser frío, mezquino, astuto, extremadamente inteligente, y sin embargo con tintes de crueldad que asemejan su conducta a la de el mejor depredador animal: Calculador, paciente. Añádale a esto el excelente trasfondo del mundo de los olores y perfumes, y el marco siempre atractivo y misterioso de la Francia pre-revolucionaria del siglo XVIII. ¿que se obtiene? una de las mejores novelas de suspenso desde el nombre de la rosa de Umberto Eco."
3,Well..kinda unique!,Well..Suskind did find a unique subject to write a book on with one man..or shall I say a monster's quest for the ultimate scent. I felt that there was something lacking in this novel as to the series of crimes were somewhat summarised as they should have been well narrated. The story was non directional or irrelevant in midstreams but it did have a short and I must say an unexpected end to it! But all the more it was an OK read.
2,"Player good, software stinks","If my experience with Musicmatch is used, I will never buy another RCA mp3 player. I received it for Christmas 2002, and have used it a LOT. If you leave the batteries in, they seem to drain for some reason. The music quality is very good, and it's not too hard to use. I wasn't aware that you could play WMA files. I like sticking with good old mp3s.Like other people, I have been very unhappy with Musicmatch. The old software works fine. You can add or remove music and see what is in the player. Now you can add music, but you can only remove music or see what is loaded by clicking on the drive icon in windows. It's VERY irritating, and Musicmatch does not seem interested in resolving the problem. With Real and Itunes supporting various players, I will try another brand in the future. Right now my eye is on the Dell jukebox."
1,It's not a MP3 Player,"You can't drag and drop MP3 files and there is no LCD to tell you what songs you can play. MusicMatch is fine but the encoding and decoding of every song takes too long even with fire-wire,I sent mine back..."
1,Junk,"I was impressed when I fist got the Lyra, it had amazing sound and good features about it like the ability to change it to Jazz or Rock, and the behind the ear headphones.Sadly, I parted with the Lyra becuase after 3 months of use it broke. I was trying to download a song into the memory and the next thing I know it won't even register any songs. I got the Lyra for Christmas and broke in March; it took RCA customer service over a month and a half to respond to my complaint and after 2 months of waiting all I'm getting out of it is $$$ and stress.There are many other MP3 players on the market that are of much better quality and usage then the Lyra or any other RCA product.I highly suggest the iRiver DataPlay or something by SonicBlue.So unless you are in the mood for migranes don't even bother to listen to the RCA Lyra."
4,Handy for Flash player,I got mine off of Ebay in April 2004. There are good points and bad points.Pros* It was one of the earlier MP3 players that allows you to use 512MB flash cards.* It is also one of the few that support true MP3pro compatibility.CONS* I would have to agree with a lot of the other owners the MusicMatch needs to get off its rearend.* The conversion process takes a while even with a fast computer.* If you do not have USB 2.0 it will take a while for you to upload the music to your Lyra.When it came out this flash player was ahead of its time. Considering most did not let you expand the flash memory or it only let you add 32MB or 64MB at most this had more options. I am planning to upgrade soon to one of the newer ones. Over all a good product.
2,Why does this have to be so hard?,"I just bought the new version -- RD1071. WMA files seem to transfer fine. They play fine. But they only play for 5-20 seconds and then everything shuts down. There is no contact information on the RCA site. They don't respond to email. There seems to be nothing I can find on the web about the problem, so now I just don't have a clue."
1,Don't buy this item,"I bought this item ... and it was the biggest waste of money. I tried time and time again to download music and it will not download anything that I try. Everytime I try to turn on the player it will not respond to the buttons, it is the slowest ting I have ever seen. Tomorrow I am going to Target and returning it. I will tell you time and time again DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM."
2,Nice Sound - Poor Software Interface,"I've got to agree with most of the other reviewers - the device itself sounds great, and for a good price, but the software is seriously wanting.Firstly, it is a misnomer to label it an MP3 player. It is not that, given that one must convert the files (with the cumpulsory, cumbersome, and generally annoying MusicMatch software) into .MPY files, the only format the unit will play. I could live with that if I could get over 30% of my MP3's to be recognized as writable.I'm returning mine tomorrow for an MP3 player that plays MP3's."
3,Player fair; software poor.,MusicMatch has to be the worst software program that I have encountered. Perhaps MusicMatch is incompatible with Windows ME. Assistance is of no benefit- all you get is gobblygoop via emails. My computer has been on the blink ever since I downloaded the upgrade which cost an extra $29.95. Freezing and constant need to reboot the computer drove me to remove MusicMatch completely to eliminate the problems.At this time I am not using the RCA RD 1070 MP3 player.It has been a bad experience all around.
5,It's So Hott,I just purcashed this item and it is great for a beginner. You can download songs really fast and it comes with a software to do that!
3,"Pretty good, but.....","I used and it was nice and exfoliating, but it left my skin rather greasy, which is why I only gave this 3 stars. But it's excellent when used to treat ingrown hairs (i.e. on the bikini line, legs, etc)."
3,E.A.'s Reveiw,"First, I'll start out with the good points of this product...1.) It has a very unique shape/cute concept idea. A very fun face soap.2.) It has a sweet fragrance that reminded me of pastries when I used it.3.) It kept my skin fairly clear of breakouts.Now on to the negatives...1.) It melts away if you keep it in contact with water. Basically it wastes away.2.) This is the biggest thing that made me give it a lower rating. It feels very disgusting when you use it. I felt like I was rubbing lard over my face."
1,Not for me!,I used it for about two days and did not like the greasy feeling it left me with. Plus I broke out in pimples after the first day. So I leave it out on the sink and today (4 days later) I decide to try it again and its covered in mold!!! It wasnt in a dark place!! So I threw this girl away:-( first time I dont like something from LUSH.
4,Sterling Silver Rose Gold Black Hills Gold wedding rings,"My man and I exchanged commitment rings and picked these out as our matching rings. They are very pretty, but we were surprised that the design doesn't encircle the entire ring (the underside is plain silver). For the price I would have expected the design to be on the entire ring. But they are very pretty and the meaning is what really matters to us, so we are pleased."
3,Ring,"I am very happy with my purchase,except for one thing. I ordered a size 51/2 ring and was sent a size 6. It is a bit too big for me. I will think twice before ordering a sized article again."
5,a well written ethnography,"I had the benefit of taking some of Dr. Reck's anthropology courses and reading this book. From what he tells me, there were many who were reluctant to call it anthropology at the time it was written because it was written as a story rather than a positivist ethnography written with a ""voice from nowhere."" One might criticize the book for not going far enough and demonstrating reflexivity by including himself within the text, but this is a minor point. This book conveys something about the culture in a readable way, which is the essence of a good ethnography in my opinion."
5,These guys ROCK,"Dogwood doesn't only have the smashing punk that we all love, but the lerics are even better, ""my Faith in you will never die"" is a part of Never Die, my fav. song. They are very inspiring, and I would recommend these guys to ne one. I love Jesus, and I love DOGWOOD! In Christ Dave"
5,This book is the cat's meow!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was very helpful. There was a lot of good, practical advice. Book gave me insight to my cat's behavior - he's pretty good at this stage - but I understand him even better now!! Thanks, Shirlee!"
2,Good Cat Book Review,"Very common sense, basic training info. My 15 year old cat is urinating all over the house, however, we have been taking him to a weekend home for 15 years and to date has never had an elimination misshap. My long time veterinarian is equally perplexed as to his different behavior in 2 different places. All the available urine analysis & blood tests were done.I've tried multiple unscented litters at home and different litter boxes to no avail. There has been no change in the location of his litter box or our behavior,that is noticeable to us!I was hoping that this book would have offered us some solution that we hadn't already tried. If you don't have extensive experience with cats, I'd recommend it to the lay cat owner!"
2,I knew the end by the fourth chapter,"It just was not worth it to me. When I am introduced to a new author, I usually read a book they have written with a common story line to see what they do to make it different, fun, sexy and above all interesting. I felt for the heroine in the beginning, there was a great loss and a strong need to have justice, but after meeting the hero and learning about his past, in like chapter 2, I knew who was behind all of it, the years of torment, and the present masacre that brought the hero and heroine together, but the sex was great, when there was some. After awhile all of the characters just became annoying. I'd give this book 2 1/2 STARS, just because the summary has to be good for me to even buy a book. I will look to see what else Ms. McKay writes, here's luck to her."
5,reminds me of beautiful memories during the 50s' r & r,"I first heard Big Sugar on LaFemme NIkita doing ""Still wailing"" and I knew I had to have this cd. This song so fits the charecter ""Michael"" of LaFemme Nikita and I play it over and over. It is so great! leigh"
5,Blues Agressivo,"As a Brazilian lad studying in Boston back in 1998, I was more than addicted on rock radios and tried to get to know as many new bands as possible. MTV was as waste of time so I used to watch MUCH MUSIC, sort of a Canadian version of that ill fated American ""music channel"". That's where I first saw BIG SUGAR and they totally blew me away.Next day I was going through the dozens of used cd stores in town looking for their material. ""Five Hundred Pounds"" was the only album I found and it's probably their best. It's blues, but it's not. It's classic rock, but it's not. It's alternative, but it's not. It just sounds irresistibly GOOD! The riffs are craunchy and the band carries a groove that 90% of the hyped bands nowadays would give their left arm to be able to create and keep.How come they never got big? Bad management, perhaps. Quality they sure got."
1,my husbands lame music,"What can I say, my husband likes this band. I find them banal and ""90's Nothing Rock"" so.. I have to give it one star, as I know one person who acutally likes this modern musak."
5,The previous review is misleading,"While the interview is ""late"" Powell, the live session is not. It is from 1953 and is prime Powell. Actually, this is the best live Powell I have run across. The Massey Hall stuff is great, but is execrable sound. This has much better sound and is superb playing all around. This one is for anyone who would like to hear Powell at his peak in a live setting in decent sound."
5,My first review and my first Mary Engelbreit book,"I discovered Mary Engelbreit by chance and I'm now hooked on her series. Some books are better than others, but this one had me crafting for all my friends. I'm definitely not a crafty person, but this book held my hand. If I can do these projects, anyone can!"
3,missing lovely artwork,Mary Engelbreit books are always filled with good ideas and creative thinking . This book is missing her great artwork which makes her books a thrill to read and take in!If wanting her artistic talent...you may want to find another one of her jewels instead! Go Mary!
3,Ok,"This is in my opinion a good basic set of knowledge of the relationship between faith and reason in the middle ages. It is pretty good, however a better read on a similar topic would be Blessed John Paul II's Fides et Ratio. Fides et ratio covers much of the same historical information as Reason and Revelation in the Middle Ages."
4,GOOD 70'S ORIGINAL RARE MOVIE,"I REMEMBER THE PRETTY GOOD ACTING AND ACTORS, the fight w/ the ""jerks ""on the range"""" and the tornado-was too brief and fx just ok. did this movie have a bear in it?"
5,have no idea what you are wanting here,This is a Christmas present so hasn't been used yet but did receive it in good shape and fast.
5,Halloween Barbies are my favorites!,"I love this Barbie and all the Halloween Barbies! I try to collect each one every year. I do wish that Target would get off of the ""Pink"" Halloween theme, it just isnt a color for Halloween! The Enchanted Halloween Barbie outfit is just wonderful and I love the colors!"
3,I'll Be Home For Christmas,"A surgeon (Robert Hays) who has lost confidence in his ability and his daughter (Ashley Gorrell,) who has lost the feeling of joy in her life, go back to his home in St. Nicholas, Iowa, for the Christmas holidays and come face to face with their past and fears.Jack Palance is wonderful as their father/grandfather. Ann Jillian as the mayor/former love interest of the surgeon gives a light to the film which is enchanting. A very pleasant holiday movie."
2,Wrong movie,"this is not the Ann Jillian movie that i was looking for i wanted the movie where she played a owner of a garden nursery , oh well i thought this movie was just ok"
4,I'll be home for Christmas,"I'll be home for Christmas was a lovely story, just a nice old fashioned movie, which suits me fine, no shooting nd violence"
4,"Lively, vigorous translation with a contemporary feel","Catullus is one of the poets who first kindled my love of poetry, and I was delighted to discover this excellent recent translation. Martin beautifully conveys Catullus' many faces and moods, from the mock-sweet lyric about his mistress' dead sparrow, to the spare, anguished syllables of odi et amo...much recommended..."
2,For American English speakers only,"Thiese translations by Martin are too cutesy in their use of modern American parlance.. 'Hooker,' ' his boy's fanny,' 'cruising,' 'faggot'... Ruins this book for me. I prefer the old Penguin edition I used to have."
4,works,"easy to install, works for my car, have not notice any power boost or increase in gas mileage thuogh."
3,What?,"I think something was up here, so follow me. I almost think this lp was a dive to get dropped by their label(Jive). I don't know the ends and outs of the music industry but after fellow hiero members had lackluster support on their lp's it was almost like souls said hell with it and put out some crap. I think Jive has screwed alot of people. I come to this conclusion and blame them for A Tribe Called Quest's break up. This lp is alright but I was expecting the moon and the stars after 93 til dropped."
4,Not nearly as bad as I thought...,"After hearing everybody completely bury this CD, I was expecting an abomination. But I was surprised. It's definitely no '93 'til Infinity - the beats and rhymes aren't as nice. And A-Plus has taken a downhill dive. He was my favourite on '93 'til, but now his rhymes are really weak. Phesto's improved and is now clearly the best lyricist, but I don't like his new style. He has some odd enunciation habits that vex me. But yeah... It's a solid CD. Expect another '93 'til and you're bound to be disappointed. I've only ever known Tribe and OutKast to actually improve on a classic debut. A word of warning though- Don't listen to track 2 - 'No Man's Land'. The jazzy saxophone loop is one of the most addictive I've ever heard. I can't get it out of my head."
3,are y'all sure that THIS ALBUM isn't their DEBUT????,"LOL HAHAHA. Naw,i'm serious on this. Can any of y'all tell that the quality of THIS album compared to '93 til infinity' sounds A LOT more 1980's. I mean.......the quality on 'No man's land' is TERRRIBLE. Not the say that the album isn't tight.....it's just that the production and quality sounds outdated...u know? Yo, i actually bought this album when it was released but i was suprised that the quality didn't sound anything close to albums released by das efx, AZ, or Onyx in 1995 (the same year as SOM). This cd is actually pretty tight but you absolutely MUST have an open mind if you're a TRUE hip hop enthusiast. Straight up n' down yo. If y'all some hiero fans i definately suggest u pick this one up. But I just wanted to point out that this album sounds a LOT older than 93 til infinity ever will. I think they shoulda released this one first. What do y'all think?? well anywayz...check y'all on tha flipside. Peacey Weasey."
4,dope,These mc's come hard with the mischief and I give much respect to Del because he rips it in '94 via satellite.
5,Great microphone for the price!!,"I bought this microphone after I got one from Radio Shack (big mistake), the quality of this one is outstanding, very clear and super portable, I had to buy a mono to stereo adapter since the sound is only in one channel (you can correct this in production w the adapter you save some time), after I found the great quality built in this little device I returned the other one from RS (really bad). If you are looking for a good and portable mic for a tide budget this one is definitely it!!"
3,Works,"I purchased these to use with my DSLR cameras the middle of last year. They worked really well initially, but they're cheap. I get some noise on them and if you move...at all, while wearing it, you'll get horrible scratchy feedback, even with a windscreen on the mic. But they work and they've done fine for most things.In the future, I'll spend the $600 (or more) and get a decent quality wireless lav. I've used several less expensive ones and you will just not get the quality you need. I would never use these with a paying client. In the meantime, I'll keep them as a back up."
3,"Story great and beautiful, book quality THIN",Do yourself a favor and save up for the hardback if they still make it. This book is very very very thin and flimsy in paperback form.
5,One of my favorite books as a kid,"I used to read this book over and over when I was a kid. It's one of the ones I remember the best from when I was a new reader. I really liked the story and the super cute illusrations. Like most little girls, I had a thing for horses. What kind of little girl wouldn't love a story about a teeny tiny horse with wings? I also like that the Stephen Cosgrove books all have a moral to the story."
5,Flutterby,I love this book. My grandmother bought it for me (hard cover version)when I was little & I still have it. It is about a very tiny winged horse named Flutterby who does not know what she is. As she tries to figure out who/what she is she tries to be a bee and later an ant. At the end a butterfly shows her her reflection and tells her that she is unique and that she should just be herself. I think this is a great story for any child to learn.
3,"1/2 the cd is really 3-D, the other is a zelda song","I don't know i just dont dig the nintendo classicals, there are really good stereo songs with more tripped out beats. it's a definite to the collection of greats."
5,VERY HAPPY,"I bought this transducer for my 581combo unit and it works great. You can see every movement you make with your jig.When i raised it up even an inch, it showed on the graph. I would recommend it."
5,How come the only book on this subject is a children's book?,"So we have an incredibly important Supreme Court case that basically defines the rights of Native Americans living on American soil. And the only book devoted to it is a Children's book? What is that about?It's a very good children's book, and it's worth a read by historians and kids alike. In fact, you SHOULD buy it for your kids... perhaps when they grow up they will take the initiative to actually write a grown-up book on this subject.Lovely illustrations, good writing style, and excellent use of sources."
4,Extended beyond my excpectations.,I thought these binoculars would be cheap crap like any other but when I got it and started using it the were great! The magnification zoom is great and it is very compact. One problem is its stability if you don't have very stable hands you will see a very shaky image when you zoom in.Overall its good quality and use full.
3,Zoom field of view?,At 7 power the field of view is bigger but what you see is a smaller circle through the eye piece. At 25 power the circle fills up the image through the eye piece but the field of view is smaller. It would be nice if the image through the eye piece was constant at all powers. I ended up leaving setting at around 10 power. The size of binoculars is handy and confortable when using.
5,great product,i was looking for a pair of binoculars that were light weight to take hiking. these fit the bill! i also love the zoom feature.the only negative is that i wish the case had a carry strap too.
3,SO -SO,These are great at the lower 7X setting but are kind of blurry at the 15x setting so I tend to not even use that setting.
1,Can't focus...can't see,"First of all - I ordered a new piece and they shipped factory refurbished product.This was horrible quality...you cannot adjust the eye piece or the center piece, and I could not use it for what I needed it for...I am returning mine ASAP!"
3,great binocs for the price,"I wanted a pair of binoculars that were light enough for carrying on hikes and powerful enough for some good bird watching and nature viewing. These fulfill those objectives just fine but lack the quality that I am accustomed to with Bushnell products. I suppose they offer them at a lower price for that reason but I am a little disappointed. The main problem is the lack of precision engineering. They tend to be stiff, difficult to open, the zoom lever doesn't move easily and you have long lost your subject by the time you manage to adjust it. I might note that my first set from amazon was defective. One of the internal prisms or lens were mounted crookedly and I had to return them for another pair. I hope that Bushnell decides to use a better quality inspection system with their Chinese made products before their reputation suffers."
4,Good light weight binolulars,"For my needs this was a good product. It was used to spot birds and other wild life. The zoom control is a bit awkward and ideally would be located in a different area, but I managed."
5,Surprise!,"These binoculars are light weight, compact, great craftsmanship , the vision is clear, the zoom is fantastic. Our family members who tried them out were truly surprised with the quality of this product, and, best of all the price was right!"
2,Good until its put to the test,"I have owned the Palm Tx for almost a year and a half and have owned two of these cases (one sent back because it was defective). The case is supposed to protect from drops, but like the reviewer above said, the lining is thin and does not work. I dropped the Tx only a few feet off a pile of books I was carrying and it broke the LCD screen, even though it was in a hard aluminum case. The case did nothing to protect from shock, and now I am out $130 to repair the screen. Do not buy this case if you think you may dropped your TX...buy bubble wrap instead!!!!!!!!"
5,Absolutely gorgeous,"I love happy accidents. Angelzoom is one of my favorite happy accidents of late. I stumbled upon the band on the internet. When I heard samples of their music, I was immediately hooked. Angelzoom is quite a contrast to Claudia Uhle's other band X-Perience. The music is not so heavy on the electronic sounds and more piano based than synth based. The music has a classical/new age sound with elements of ambient and goth. Claudia has a beautiful voice. Her voice is very clear and it matches well with the intricate melodies. It is really difficult for me to pick out a favorite song on the cd because I love each and one of them. I enjoyed the band's interpretations of ""Blasphemous Rumors"" and ""Crawling"" (especially since I am no fan of Linkin Park). You wouldn't think that a Linkin Park song wouldn't sound good as a classical/pop/ambient song but it does. I hope that ""Angelzoom"" isn't a one album project because I really loved what I heard on this cd."
2,Doesn't actually fit all first generation Tundra,"There are three factory stereo configurations for first generation Tundras. There is the stock OEM system with two ten pin adapters. As far as I know this adapter will fit these. There is also a ""factory upgraded"" stereo with an amplifier in the dash (early Tundras) or under the right rear jump seat (2005-06 Tundra). These use two 20 pin adapters. This harness will NOT fit and even if you somehow made it fit, it wouldn't work because the amp will not turn on. The third option is the widely known JBL upgrade.So if you are considering replacing the factory stereo in your Tundra make sure what you have first. If you have tweeters in your front doors, but no ""JBL"" identification on the stereo, then you have the factory amplifier option and this will not fit.You can buy an adapter (Tato for the JBL system) that will work on the non-JBL amplified system. Just be sure to follow all of the instructions carefully."
5,Works great,"I got the Lyra this morning as an ""impulse buy,"" and I love it! I had it working in only a few minutes, and I am only of average intelligence. I also bought a 256MB multimedia card, and I have hours of music -- cheap! Your average primate would have no problem getting this thing running."
5,Best tool for bathing and brushing dogs,"I use the Zoom Groom all the time. It can be used on most coats during bathing to remove undercoat. However, if using for brushing out undercoat when the dog is dry, it is best for shorthair dogs."
5,Every note counts,"There are no hiding places in Mozart, every note counts. Hilary Hahn gives every notea flavor. This cd is a model of what treasures can be heard in Mozart when realized by a superior artist."
5,Just another William Wellman masterpiece.,"When you place this film in the context of the time it was made, it becomes even more powerful. The country was in the grasp of the ""Red Menace. We were placing Asian-Americans in what were nothing but glorified concentration camps. For William Wellman to make a movie dealing with the dark side of humanity and mob actions required enourmous courage. The reason it flopped was due to Americans having to look in the mirror and not liking what they saw. Great performances from a cast that included Henry Fonda and Harry Morgan."
2,Misleading,"I don't see how this is a floor lamp. It's less than 2 feet tall.On the bright side, it's very bright and looks nice on a table."
3,Retro Love,"I love Jack Lemmon. Love Judy Holiday. But together...in this movie anyway...a dud. I blame it on the script. It was not smart, clever, or in the least imaginative. I was bored most of the time, but I stuck with it and watched it all the way through. It reminded me of so many movies of the era. That was the problem. It seemed to take twists from other movies and mesh them all together into one film. But judge for yourself. It was great seeing these fine comedics again. I just wish the movie had more going for it than the yawn syndrome."
2,Dull and predictable,"This movie starts with the married couple Jack Lemmon and Judy Holiday divorcing each other. The ending is very predictable. That would be okay, except the journey to the end is not much fun. Judy Holiday is just not an appealing actress. Kim Novak is not in the movie very much, and she comes across as a young bimbo. (She had much more depth in her role in Vertigo.) This movie is suppose to be a romantic comedy. There are flashbacks showing the couples courtship and these might be a little appealing with a different actress. Then there are scenes of Jack and Judy trying to learn to become swinging singles. Jack Lemmon's womanizing friend was very unappealing. It turned my stomach listening to his little speech on various ways to try to get a woman in bed. There isn't any humor, and the script is just boring. Call me bored. However, the picture was crystal clear. Great copy of the movie."
2,Lost in Translation,"As a non-Jew attempting to better appreciate, study and understand Judiasm, I bought this version of the Mishnah. I had read Neusner's Introduction, and found it very well done. Unfortunately, the reported poetic nature and subtleties that appear to be present in the Hebrew are lost in translation here. It reminded me of reading the tax code. I believe this is a well done scholarly work, but I would suspect that for a Jew, the Hebrew version is what you want - and for a non-Jew, one of the other (non-literal) translations that are apparently better to read (see other reviews) would be a better choice."
5,Purchased Used,"Like the previous reviewer, I also purchased this product used. It was an impulse buy at a local thrift shop. It worked, it was a great deal, so I bought it.Anyway, it has turned out to be a fantastic DVD player. It's my second portable DVD player, and it is way better than the first one I bought, which is a lower end Audiovox. This ""new to me"" DVD player has much better screen resolution, has a nice large screen, great sound even without headphones, and is nice and slim. It has more hook-ups and settings to satisfy my inner geek, more than I will ever use. The only bad thing about my player is that it didn't come with a remote or component cable. The remote was an easy fix; I just went back to the thrift store and bought a Toshiba DVD remote and it works fine. The cable, while less important, will be more difficult since it seems to have a proprietary connection on the DVD player side.All in all, an amazingly great DVD player for the age and cost - [...] bucks!"
3,"Its ok, but a little pricey for the quality","Its a nice novelty grill. But its not real high quality. Mine fell off a cart about 6"" and the plastic handle broke into 6 pieces. Grill is a little flimsy too. It works ok. Its not terrible and does an adequate job of grilling, but you can get better for less $$."
5,Excellent telling of the Battle and those that fought there,"Mr Groom has done it again. An excellent telling of this important battle, the men involved and he details what the British endured before, during and after the battle. It shed plenty of light on the British side of the fight as well as the other key cast members: Jackson (he sure did hate the British with a passion, Jean Lafitte and company, the various militia groups and esteemed citizenry of New Orleans and elsewhere.The savage fighting that took place before the battle and the various soldiers and their experiences were most interesting.Well worth reading and pondering."
5,Andrew Jackson and Jean Laffite at the battle of n o,This is the best!!! book I have found on the history of the Battle of New Orleans!I started reading it and I could not put it down.
1,Beware the Audiobook Gremlins,"Disc 2 is a repeat of disc one in the one I bought. Currently, Borders is 10 days into ""promising me another copy"". Anyone else find this quality control fault from the publisher, Tantor?"
3,hmmmm Not really true to the original,"The story was ok. The songs were a little lame. My daughter enjoyed it though. She has already watched more times than I can count. :)My problem with it was that some of the scenes were just way out of character if you take the original film into consideration. The original film was a good work.But, all in all, this film is right on for the younger audience (under 8). They probably won't even notice any of the differences between the original and this one."
2,I expected a story book.,"It is not clear that it is a story book at all only if you look and see that it is for guitar and piano, which i did not do when i purchased this item. Anyhow it was not worth for me to return a book of $10 with a shipping charge of $9 or so. But it is not right, rather confusing. Please correct this big mistake. I see I am not the only one who had such an experience with this book."
1,"This is sheet music, not a storybook","I was surprised and disappointed to discover that this ""book"" is piano, vocal and guitar sheet music; I expected a storybook. The information about this book should be more clear, in fact, I'm not sure why there's are other reviews that review this as a book--perhaps they didn't review this book, but rather the story in general. Anyway, check with amazon before you order it so you know for sure what you're getting."
1,misleading item description,We ordered this book thinking it was the storybook and were quite surprised and disappointed when it turned up as a songbook from the movie instead. The item description needs to state that it is a music book to avoid confusion.
3,Over-the-top,"Let me start off by saying I love parody and pastiche. In fact, I actually enjoy some of the Sherlock Holmes pastiche and parodys MORE than Conan Doyle's original stories.That being said, I have to say I was kind of disappointed in this novel. Cece Caruso is so over-the-top that she isn't a character, she is a caricature and not very believable. The author also depicts Nancy Drew fans much like the over-the-top Trekkies. The writing in general is choppy at best and I could never fully get into the spirit of the book. While there are some good merits, in general I think the author just tried to hard."
3,sophomore slump?,"I'd rate ""Not a Girl Detective"" a 3.5. In my opinion, it doesn't quite live up to the standard of ""I Dreamed I Married Perry Mason"". Since there is no ""real"" Carolyn Keene, there isn't much of interest there to wrap a plot around so the idea of Nancy Drew collectors is a pretty good one, but the execution in this case is spotty. Many threads were introduced, thinly developed and ultimately just sort of dropped on the side of the road. Mysteries need red herrings to keep the reader guessing, but these felt as though they were disjointed. Perhaps the author intended for there to be more ties linking the story threads and was unsuccessful. Some of the red herrings were more interesting to me than the actual ""real"" conclusion, so the ending left me a bit foggy. I still like Cece Caruso and her friends and will read the next book hoping that I'll like it as well as I liked the first in the series."
5,Cyndi Lauper is the best!!!,"Cyndi did an amazing job on this song (as usual) If you like dance, and specially if you love and appreciatte great vocals this single can't be left out of your collection."
5,Balloon Display,I purchased this balloon to be used as a visual display showcasing a Hot Air Balloon ride that I donated for a local charity.....it worked out well.......
4,Electronic tribute is ear candy to Erasure fans,"This tribute is certainly the best tribute I have ever bought (ABBA's tribute isn't bad, but the recent tribute to Madonna is terrible). There are many excellent tracks on this album, but none match the strength of their originals (though con-cept's ""breath of life"" and philtron's ""when I needed you"" do come close). As with most electronic acts, the vocals are rather amateurish, and since Erasure's music translates really well into techno, the music becomes the star rather than the singer(s). I was disappointed to see that the covers only go as recently as ""Always"" (ignoring the past 2 albums completely), 4 (of the 10) covers are from the same album (Chorus), and there were no covers from Wild! If you like covers (I do) and love Erasure (oh yeah!) then you should definitely buy this album."
5,What an improvement,"The new version of this adapter is made of much stronger plastic (the original was soft rubber). It also now has two latch type prongs that hold it securely to my sander. Bosch offers four additional adapters to enable you to connect a variety of shop vac hoses to this adapter:BOSCH 1-1/4"" or 1-1/2"" hose-to 35 mm port Adapter VAC002BOSCH 35mm hose-to-1-1/4"" port Adapter VAC003BOSCH 35mm hose to-2-1/4"" port Adapter VAC004"
2,Paying twice ...,"I was just scratching my head, why this small plastic part did not come with sander. It cost almost 1/5 of the sander with S&H.;The round hole is too small! It reduces airflow to about 1/3 of the original oval hole. More, round hole is very non-standard, so you will need adapter for this adapter, if you have any standard american hose. Btw, Bosch hose i a joke. Don't even think about that.I made a new adapter for my 2"" Ridgid hose, which goes from the outside of the oval hole, not from inside. Airflow more then tripled.I would not recommend this to anybody with enough skills to make a better adapter."
2,Waste of money,"Shipping was a ripoff, I paid $8 for shipping.I did have to buy a step adapter for my shop vac becase I didn't want to buy another adapter and spend another $8 in shipping. My sander worked a lot better when I attached it, however the clips that hold it to the sander broke after 2 weeks.Bosch, same on you for such a terrible system."
2,Poor Fit,I purchased the RS006 and VAC001 as a package. What can you say about an adaptor. It works. it fits the Bosch sander just fine. The ear clips are poorly fitted when compared to the exhaust filter that ships with the sander. Had to force mine to extend far enough to clasp the sander. The lack of dust in my enclosed basement workshop is its endearing quality. Bosch should ship this attachment with the sander. Cost more to ship it than to purchase it.
1,"fits, but does no good","I bought this adapter for an older 3283dvs sander, which originally came with a flimsy bag filter. I also added a microfilter cartridge. After sanding a kitchen's worth of cabinets and 8 conference room tables, I don't think the system has collected more than a couple of tablespoons of dust. Most of it ends up on the outside of the sander or in the air. Apparently, my sander is just not set up right for the pressurization of the microfilter.I am a big fan of Bosch tools and believe they are genuinely well-engineered. But I bought this system on their customer support agent's recommendation and wish I hadn't"
1,Adapter doesn't work very well.,"I have a Bosch 1295 DVS. The ears on this adapter will not grab the sander. I spend so much time fighting this adapter, I don't enjoy using the tool. Last night I gave up and decided to go buy a different sander. Tool manufacturers have a responsibility to take dust collection seriously. Sadly, Bosch does not live up to their responsibility."
4,It's flawed but does the job,"I've got one of these that I use on my 1293 1/2 sheet sander and 1295 ROS. I use it in conjunction with the adaptor to an 1 1/4 vac hose. It does a far better job of collecting dust than when using the supplied cannister. In fact the only real dust that seems to escape is when you are sanding an edge.My complaint is that Bosch doesn't make one of these for the North American market that doesn't require an adaptor to mate up to a 1 1/4 hose. Having to use an adapter just extends the arm of the lever and puts more strain on the clips.Having said all that I'm going to order another one, with adaptor, so that I can leave one on each of my sanders and don't have to switch the vaccuum adaptor from one to another."
3,"Works, but what a pain to hook it up.","The RS006 fits on my Bosch half sheet sander just fine, but getting it connected to my dust collection system was another story. I just don't understand why tool makers can't standardize their hoses, or at least publish inner/outer diameters of their products so it would be straight forward to hook them up."
3,Looks nicer than it works,"I bought to use with my Bosch sander. It fits, and that is about the nicest part I can share. I got better dust control with the bag on than the adapter and a vacuum hose. Save your money, the bag works great."
3,Please note: Midwest book review,"It should be noted that Midwest book review gives 5 stars to every book they rate. This is a good book on the subject of Sea Anchors and Drogues but is a bit dated in some of the information it presents. It relies heavily on data supplied by the makers of the equipment, thus the assessment of their performance is somewhat skewed."
3,KATELAND,"A short 30 minute documentary, showing us that dueing the winter months in Venice, how the people put on carnival masks, and stand silently amongest the crowds, useing the architecture of this old city as their magnificent back drop, very much wanting to be noticed, and seeking some admiration from the crowds. All this is about dressing up, disguise, and enchantment. This colorful spectacle, developes when silent masked forms stroll under the arches and arcades of Venices grand old buildings. And then wander into St Marks Square, where they stand very silent and still, looking almost like statues, as hundreds of people pass by them. Dressed in strikeing carnival costumes of many colors, and with expensive venetian masks. This is their carnival time. And some of these Masks are amazeing. We also see some nice scenery in, and around this lagoon city of Venice. Iv given it 3 stars. Although nice, everything looked to be slow moveing."
2,More Fusion than Space,"I love everything Patrick O'Hearn has recorded since his days on Private Music. So when I saw that he was one of the members of the trio on this performance, I immediately ordered it. Unfortunately, the songs are extended exercises in 70's-style jazz fusion, and they fail to keep the viewer engaged. This disappointment might have been ameliorated by good camera work, but Mr. O'Hearn is completely and inexplicably ignored by the cameras during the entire performance. It's very strange, and I cannot recommend this dvd to any Patrick O'Hearn fans."
3,"still good, but such a disappointment after season 1","agree with the other reviewer. the animation changed, the charming quirks have gotten more manic. most episodes have a some sort of automotive chase in it. it's like they souped up the animation and lost the commitment to charm, narrative, and quirkiness in favor of hollywood tricks."
5,LOVE IT!,I cannot get enough of Shaun the Sheep and enjoy watching these all the time! There is something incredibly witty and charming about all the episodes. I wish they were producing more seasons.
1,do not like him,"We are regret to spend so much money to see this eye doctor (Melvin Kaplan).Before the visit, I thought it was worthy of trying because my child has some visual depth problems and his book seems to be encouraging. However, his service turned out to be terrible. We paid $900 for 90 min eye exam. but remember, the real time he spend on my child is less than 30 min. He spent quite a lot of time on his stories to explain how good he is. The worst part is, the new glasses is not working for my child at all. and when I called them, there is no way to contact melvin Kaplan directly. He will neither answer your phone nor call you back.After I met with some other parents later on, they had negative experiences with this eye doctor too. I wish I should know this earlier so I won't waste money and time on him."
5,Exquisite 7 String Guitar !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is an exquisite ""tribute to Jobim"" CD by the Brazilian master of the Violao 7 Cordas, Raphael Rabello... this is the most soul-full 7 string guitar playing that i've ever heard & some of the best guitar playing ever !!! from the opening track's collaboration with Paco de Lucia on Samba do Aviao to his solo guitar's finale on the beauty-full ballad Luiza- this CD is inspiring to any afficianado of virtuoso guitar playing, brazilian violao 7 cordas, & music with ""Duende do Ciganos""... Ole to Raphael Rabello for this masterwork & all his wonder-full collaborations !!! i also recommend his duet CD w/ Dino 7 Cordas as phenomenal nylon string & 7 string guitar Brazilian virtuosity... just amazing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Thank you Gincy!!This is a must read for beginner, amatuer, and experienced","I have read How Your Horse Wants You To Ride: I can't say enough positive things about this book. I have some experience with horses and have learned a lot more from this book. the interesting thing is that those areas I had difficulty with (some pretty basic ones that I did not know I was not doing correctly) improved ten fold. I have pps, left leg weakeness, etc.. so i was taking lessons with a wonderful therapuetic ridiing instructor. She talked about my ""seat"", ""balance"" and ""centered riding"". I never fully understood exactly where thatwas until I read Gincy's book. Now i work with a morgan mare, and have implemented the 7 steps with her. It has changed her behavior and mine. I love this book....my husband calls it the ""rider's bible"".. and fears I will wear it out!!!!By all means, anyone looking for a helpful, accurate book on horses this is the best i have read."
5,practical information,This book is absolutely loaded with all kinds of practical and helpful information for anyone involved with horses. An excellent find!!
1,abnouxious book,"This book sickens me. First of all I bought this book thinking it would help me with my hands, ( I had rough hands, until my mom helped me) and teach me some new techniques or moves. But this looks like it was made by total beginners!! I've never heard or seen half the techniques, I mean when you want to turn left, you don't lean to the right!!! NONSENSE!!! and in the pictures, these women look deathly afraid of the horses!! Their leaning forward half the time. The horses look scraggly and unhealthy. They ride their horses in cheap halters and reins. At least use a hackamore!This is coming from a 13 year old girl and I expected much better. NOT WORTH THE TIME, MONEY OR INTERNET SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TOTAL DISSAPOINTMENT"
5,Becoming more careful and horse smart,"As an older rider and used to owning and riding lesson horses, I learned that trying to replace the one I lost was more than a challenge. I never learned to ride properly. This beauiful older horse carried me and took care of me. Shadowcreek knew his job and riding areas so well that sometimes it didn't matter what I told him to do. What an awakening trying to replace him. A bombproof horse??? Do they really exist?Horses are very sensitive, reactive animals. My horse was an exception. Trained, safe and he loved me.This book told me all the things I should have known a long time ago. Make intelligent, safe decisions, get a great trainer and know as much about horses as you can. Horses have had all kinds of owners and experiences. They have different personalities.One of the best books about horses, training, and riding that I have found. Enjoy every page."
4,Great for starting out and as a refresher,"I actually bought this for my husband because he doesn't ride as much as I do and (apparently) I'm not a good instructor! I read most of it myself and it's filled with good, basic information. Everyone could do a better job of riding, just ask your horse!"
5,The Best,THIS IS THE BEST YOU HAVE TO READ IT! AND OH YEAH N'SYNC RULES AND I LOVE J.C. IT IS HIS BIRTHDAY ON AUGUST 8TH SO HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO HIM! I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH AND I HAVE ALL OF THEM BUT THIS IS THE BEST BY FAR. IT IS A 'MUST' READ!
3,Better ending to the series than I expected,"Several of the books in this series had a rushed feel to them, I thought the writing got better in this one.The teens finally figure out a way to free Max from the collective consciousness and free the alien homeworld from it's grip as well. I'd expected the story to be pretty sloppy but was pleased to see it was better.The Max/Liz and Michael/Maria romances even ran pretty much the way the TV series did with the exception that in this story Michael was going to return to the homeworld with brother Trevor and Isabel was going to go with him. Isabel decides to remain with her ""family""and Michael, who had never admitted his feeling to Maria, decided that he too had to stay.You do kind of get left with a ""where's the rest of the series?"" feeling as this is the last we see of the Roswell storyline."
4,Is this the last book?,"I love the Roswell series, even more than the the tv show and this book totally lived up to my expectations. You have to read the first 9 books to understand this one but once you do they're addictive. In this book Max is fully losing himself to the concienses. Micheal's thinking about going home with trevor. We find out where Kyle Valenti has been the whole time, and much much more! Just one question, though. is this the last book? someone please post the answer. thanx."
4,More Raylan,Another book with Justified's cool deputy marshal... It was good but not as good as Pronto in my opinion. I need to see more books written about this quirky character and his exploits.
4,Getting in touch with Raylan's roots,"I am a devoted fan of JUSTIFIED, and I had to read the Elmore Leonard books that established the character. REALLY enjoy reading the books; I just envision the TV characters as I read, which is so the opposite of how I generally experience books and tv shows or movies. But I love Leonard's style."
3,Past Prime,"Compared to the truly wonderful Elmore Leonard classics, like City Primeval or Fifty-two Pickup, Riding the Rap doesn't come anywhere near the mark. It's disappointing and kind of flat, but very cinematic; surely it will make a good movie because with enough name-brand actors, the plot-line will acquire some lacquer that the book itself lacks. Nothing much happens. The characters are shallow, as if painted in watercolor, rather than the dense oil paints Leonard once used. All in all, it's a pity--disappointing in the extreme."
3,Riding the Rap,Pretty good but not as much action as I would have liked. Did not like this book as well as some of the other Elmore Leonard books I have read.
4,Riding the Rap,"As always Elmore Leonard did it again. The ""nuts"" in this one are delightfully OUT THERE in a zanny way"
3,Spoiled by TV show,The book is good but I am spoiled by being a fan of the TV show. I just keep trying to reconcile them and it isn't possible.
1,Rip-off,"Here's another rip-off in the Raylan series. The story is finished after circa 75% of the offered pages. After that it's Leonard-here and Leonard-there, newspaper and literature magazine stuff. The story itself is neither thrilling nor interesting. Literally I will close my books of Leonard now - no more."
4,Comic Crime Romp,"Elmore Leonard considered one the premier crime writers of our generation doesnt let up in Riding the Rap.The usual dynamic relentless pacing is apparent which gives the books no dry spells.The best part of this book has to be the characterizations and dialogues. Whacky characters include a Peurto Rican gardener gangster, a middle aged pothead gangsta wannabe, and a female psychic looking to make it.As mentioned before, the pacing makes this book a gauranteed blast, highly recommended."
4,Another good one from Leonard...,"I've said it once and I'll say it again... no one writes dialog like Leonard. If you want to know where Tarentino got his inspiration for the off-beat dialog in Pulp Fiction, this is the man.Riding the Rap is a great sequel with more of the same for Givens and Arno.I highly recommend it."
4,"A fine, funny read.","This was my first Elmore Leonard. I came to him through Martin Amis's recommendation, thinking that any prose good enough for Martin would be good enough for me. I wasn't disappointed. 'Riding the Rap' is unashamedly light reading, what another reviewer rightly called a 'guilty pleasure', but on its own terms it is a really first-rate piece of craftsmanship. The characters are interesting -- they're all a little skewed; the dialogue outstanding; and there's a rich vein of humour, much of it quite broad, running through the book. On the strength of this one, I'll be reading more Elmore Leonard."
2,Slow,"The sentences are well written. Leonard describes things well. But it was a slow read. Everything was leading up to the last few pages, where the only action occurred. He could have had those pages, plus a few before them, and had a good short story. But for a novel, it's too thin."
4,God bless Elmore Leonard,"There's hardly ever a truly good guy in Leonard's books. Even the best of his protagonists who ride in on white horses to slay evil dragons have a dark side, a dark secret, or a dark sin. And the worst of the baddies all have some marvelous redeeming or hilarious quality that makes you root for them now and then.There should be, instead of Murphy's Law, a Leonard's Law, in which some seemingly simple scheme will inevitably turn complex and twisted when this master of his genre gets hold of it.In Riding the Rap, we get to revisit Florida Marshall Raylan Givins as he investigates the disappearance of his girlfriend's ex-lover. Don't ask. It's too complicated to go into details in a short book review. Just trust me: it's filled with the usual Leonard people-stew of weirdos, strange scams, superb dialogue full of lingo and slang, and and and and...Not his very best, but very good stuff."
3,elmore leonard,"elmore leonard is considered one of the best crime writers today.he paints everyday criminals with a certain realisjm and distinction.in riding the rap, an ex mobster gets kidnapped by a guy who owes him money and two other guys.they plan on emptying his bank account and running off to the bahamas.that's when federal marshal raylan givens goes out to bring the ex mobster back safe and sound as a favor to his girlfriend.a gardner, an ex stripper and a fortune teller are only a few of the players in this crime caper."
4,Leonard strikes again!,"Riding the Rap is classic Leonard. Loveable drunk ex-bookie Herry Arno is in trouble again! When two ex-cons and a rich boy pot head come up with a plan to make easy money, Harry is kidnapped! Can his former wifes stenson wearing cowboy cop boyfriend save him from certain monitary loss? Find out in this souped up sequel to Pronto!"
1,"cheap, cheap, cheap","One would hope that Morbisch production DVDs would all be published to the same standard, but this one is clearly not as good as some of the others (Grafin Mariza for example). The production can only be likened to the sound of the vogel -- cheap, cheap, cheap. First -- no subtitles -- for an operetta that has large amounts of dialogue this is not forgivable-- unless you understand German much of the program is uninteligible. 2nd - this DVD unlike other DVDs from Morbisch does not have a 16:9 option -- only 4:3. 3rd -- close ups of characters slapping mosquitos suggest a bored tape editor. Save your money, unless you have a fixation on Der Vogelhandler or Carl Zeller your experience with operetta will be better served with other DVDs."
1,BEWARE: NO SUBTITLES,This is the second time I have been stung by a DVD with no subtitles. These are good performances of German operettas. But the presentation is lazy and cheap: especially for an obscure work.. What we get instead are three short summary paragraphs for a work which depends upon being able to understand the dialogue. Amazon colludes in the ruse by saying there are subtitles. Shame. Let's have a little honesty in the future.
1,No subtitles,"No subtitles or booklet (synopsis available from menu): process initiated to correct Amazon product info.(rating based solely on lack of subtitles, not the performance: Amazon requires a rating simply to comment)"
5,Best Book Besides the Bible Itself,"Best book I've ever read on the basic principles of applying the Power of the Holy Written Word of God to your life!!! Everyone should have a copy of this and the ""Scripture Keys"" book also."
1,Okay but lacking,"This is not bad for a basic overview of hoe SCADA shojuld be used and implemented. It seemed lacking to me since so much of the value in SCADA is in the interactions with the PLC's, RTU's and datbases. I felt this book was weak in that area.I would have liked to see more application examples across industry and some innovative ways to use data bases to drive PLC systems - this is the true strength of a well designed SCADA system.It could be better, but not bad for a starter book."
2,incomplete,"After procuring a copy of this book, I discovered that it does not even reproduce Kuyper's lectures."
5,love's enduring promise... good book,I enjoy this book. The content is great and I love that it is clean enough that a young person can read it without worrying about bad language or innapropriate content. My one issue is the old fashioned writing when the characters speak. It is written how the people would speak(accents and limited vocabulary)...I'm sorry I can't explain it any other way. After a while of reading you get use to it. It is a book I would certainly recommend
5,Love Enduring Promise,"Purchase went very well. A++++++++ Books came in perfect condition. I would recomend this seller.This book is a great book for any age, I started my young teenage grand daughters off reading the ""Love comes softley"" series, but the are great for any age. My mother read them late in life when she was too weak to be able to do other activities. I never saw my Mother read books except for Janette Oke's books,and she could not put any of them down till she was finished with them and wanted to start a new one.THanks for the great job!"
3,"Good, but too fast","This book ties 1 and 3 together. Too, many things were happening and there were too many characters to remember. It didn't focus on ""the family"". It introduced Willie at the very end. But, it was OK, if you are reading the series, you will need to read this book. Not one of my favorites in the series, but good reading. And, if you can, see the film. Although it does not follow the book , you will fall in love with Missie and Willie."
3,"All about Missie, Clae and Nandry","Book two covered way more time span than book one. When the book opens, the community is hoping for a school to be built and Missie is barely 5 yrs. old. When the book ends, she is a bride. In the interim, Clae and Nandry have lost both their parents for different reasons, moved to a new home, and each has married. Clark and Marty continue on, having several children in this one book which I feel covers way too much time too quickly. I have already started re-reading book 3."
2,The first one is a great deal better,"I learnt a lot from the first book so that's why I bought this one. But I find it disappointing. There isn't any climax. I just browsed thru this book without reading every word, unlike I usually do.I may say ""Love's enduring promise"" is boring."
3,thin metal,"the product looks better in the photo. Where the metal attached to the handles it seem thin and flexible.I find no fault with the vendor, I should have seen them in person before ordering.Thanks for the opportunity to share."
5,Meat Loaf just got healthier!,"Wow, this really made meat loaf much healthier since the fat drains down and away. The non-stick feature really works! I had dropped some of the glaze on the perimeter of the pan and it baked on and turned black. It cleaned away with ease; in fact, washing the pan was a breeze. The pan set itself is somewhat heavy and feels very durable. I wish I had bought this sooner as my husband loves meat loaf but I haven't made it often due to the fat sitting in the pan. That problem has now been eliminated! I would not hesitate in purchasing this pan. This has been a pleasant experience. I am sure I will be using this pan for years to come. Happy Cooking!"
2,Pan is peeling,"Used this pan for a year and it was great. But now the coating on the inside is peeling. Must throw it away. If this is going to happen with the pans, I'd recommend buying a cheaper pan and then just tossing it out after a year."
5,Great Invention,"What a find! I used to make meatloaf in a Pyrex loaf pan, so it was always full of grease. Then for years I baked them on a broiler pan so the grease would run off. This pan lets you do both. It is a loaf pan with holes for the grease to drain off. I love it. I'm buying a second one for my personal chef cooking kit."
5,I Love This Pan,"I started making meat loaf in it the first day! It's so well built, and easy to clean. The very high quality is readily apparent. It'll probably outlive me!"
1,peeling pan,"I purchased less than a year ago and already am seeing peeling from inside of thenon stick coating. These pans are of poor quality and can only be used at low heat.Do not buy, its a waste of your hard earned money!!"
1,Video very poor,"Although this performance was many years ago and new production standards were not expected, this DVD was almost too poorly produced to watch on my HD system."
3,"Great Story, Pictures, Not so much","I loved the imagination of this girl, her assertive nature. When she was lonely she didn't pull on those around her to fulfill her needs but made her own friends, literally.I wasn't enthusiastic about the artwork. In fact, there are pages that I thought maybe a child got hold of some markers and started scribbling. But the story was priceless.For me the best part was the visuals I got about living on an island surrounded by the sea. Love it!BCID: 384-11130385"
4,Deep and thought provoking,"I found this book is quite deep and quickly gets into the realm of conceptual and spiritual ideas. Just as the well-known book ""The Inner Game of Golf"" deals with the mental side of the game, this book addresses the spiritual side. Having read this, I'm not totally convinced that I understand all the points that are being made, and some are easier to take on board than others. My interpretation of the overall message of this book is that it is all about coming to understand your own place in things and learning to transcend the tensions that exist within life. This is mirrored in golf and the way we approach the game. It should be pointed out that the book isn't really about lowering your golf handicap as such. Like any text concerning spiritual matters, faith and a willingness to suspend cynicism play a big part in determining how much you get out of this. Overall this book is enjoyable and intriguing at the same time, but some of the concepts might be better explained."
3,Strained Format,"Dr. Chopra offers good advice for the ""feel"" aspect of golf -- getting out of the head and into the moment, turning down the interior noise, breathing deeply, swinging with a conviction based on interior knowledge rather than exterior sight. All that is timeless, supremely useful, and clear when Chopra writes from the first-person, in his introduction and chapter summaries. But I wish he hadn't felt it necessary to wrap his counsel in the gauze of the ridiculous fairy tale of Adam and Leela, which fluffs his brief teaching up to book-length. Perhaps some people learn better this way, but such contrived dream sequences as these bring only confusion to my mind, as well as evoking the scorn that hard-headed realists feel for all things ""New Age."""
3,Too Deep For Me,"I'm a golfer of limited talent. Time after time, I've chunked easy wedges, hit drives out of bounds, and left putts short of the hole. It makes me mad.The main lesson that I learned in this book was that I should live for the moment and not let my bad shots bother me. Unfortunately, my human frailties and emotions often overcome this advice, no matter how much I attempt to be mindful of every shot.Chopra's basic premise seems to be that golf is akin to a spiritual journey and that the lessons of golf can be applied to everyday life. I agree with the basic premise, but didn't need the 7 lessons in the book to achieve this revelation. I'm going to stick with my Harvey Penick's Little Red Book because it offers more practical advice that keep me from making the mistakes that boil my blood and cause a negative outlook on golf."
2,"Good heavens, what a terrible book.","I started laughing out loud when I flipped through this book. Blah New Age mumbo-jumbo is bad enough, but combining it with GOLF is so suburban, it hurts.I gave this book two stars, though, because sadly enough, I could picture MT/CEO-types reading it and actually improving their golf games."
2,Weak,"This cd is ok... but it is extremely weak. There are few good songs. I've noticed that they have grown more immature than better in their musical scope. This cd is a give or take, but I'd rather go sell it for some extra cash than keep it in a dusty pile of cd's I dislike."
1,Complete and utter garbage,"When a friend of mine told me I should listen to this group, telling me that, according to my tastes, I would love them, I decided I would take a listen. I have never felt so insulted in all my life. This was to me, Vengaboys gone goth! It sounds as ridiculous as that! The lyrics seem to have been written by a 10 year old, living a life of luxury and trying to pretend that her life is horrible. Completely unimaginative in all aspects. Pretentious and confused. I could try and listen to this album fifty times, standing on my head, under covers, with the vacuum on and it would still sound as bad. There is NOTHING to discover in this music, as there is nothing original about it. This critic does not only apply to this particular album but to the whole output from this group. This is teeny-bop goth music at it's worst. I can only feel ashamed for the poor artists daring to put music like this out on the market! You have been warned."
1,EEeeew!,"This CD sucks! Switchblade Symphony should've never gotten a sampler!!! The only hope is that like Xymox, Switchblades will pass this commercial ""techno-pop"" phase, fitted for a major lable, and return to their original goth sound, angry and creepy! As for the people saying that it doesn't matter what genre they are playing, well, they are still kind of signed to Cleopatra... When they are on COLUMBIA or David Geffen, or at least Nothing the charges will be dropped."
2,What the hell happened to this band???,"SS have a rather massive fanbase, that's why their efforts can't fail--people will buy their stuff even if they'll start playing something really weird. Well at least for a while. That's why I bought this CD. People said it so many times before me--Serpentine Gallery rocked my world, Bread and Jam was mediocre but still kind of hot on the heels of the great debute CD, Three Calamities is just annoying. My friend who likes old SS, borrowed it from me and returned it the next day after listening to the first 3 songs saying that it's too boring to endure...If you are into real gothic music, there's much better stuff out there, don't waste your time and money on this one!"
5,A fine work,Switchblade Symphony Grow and expand as many great band offten do which makes them last in the minds of the masses. A heavyer Hip Hop element is present but does not take away from the mavelous sound that has been over the past 6 years.I'm Gabriel and your not.
4,Very fluid like and lyrically the best of them all,"I liked this album. You can actually sit and listen to it from beginning to end. I didn't warm up to it as easily as the last two, but now it has become one of my favorites. I feel that it didn't quite touch the magic of Bread and Jam for Frances. Everyone seems to favor Serpentine Gallery for some reason. I think they were much more experimental in Bread and Jam. I would have liked them to expand on that more. And in my opinion, they still have that goth sound and feel but seem to be signing their own signature to this style. I recommend this to anyone who is tired of what the radio is playing."
4,"Not as good as their first album, but still good","Some of the drum loops are irritating, and ""Therapy"" sounds tossed off, but overall this is pretty good. It sounds a bit like a low-key version of ""Serpentine Gallery"" with some of the elements from ""Bread & Jam..."" thrown in (NOT the record scratches, thankfully). They keep the experimentation from the latter album, but it seems more like they know what they're doing this time around (that's not to say that they don't misstep, they just don't do it as often). ""Serpentine Gallery"" is still my fave, but this isn't bad."
4,I'll admit it...,"This album sure sounds more like Bread and Jam than Serpentine Gallery. It is an album that you probably won't like at first. I say listen to it again. And then again. Slowly it'll grow on you. For those looking for a plain old goth album, peddle yourself elsewhere. If your looking for a good album from two talented artists, then look no farther. And bullocks to whoever says Sbs has sold out. They're doing what they want, not what you want them to do. So, pfffftt!!!"
5,simply the best,"I noticed some of you don't like this album, but you have to remember things change, things evolve overtime and if you can't accept it, if your not a diverse individual when it comes to music, you shouldn't be reviewing it at all. This CD is by far the best of the 3 albums SS has released. Besides being goth is about being yourself, not living up to the standards of what other people want you to be. People that do not like this album, are probably the same group of people that did not like Phantom Menace because it wasn't like the first 3 films. Times change. If this album had been like the first one, I'd have been bored because I've already heard it millions of times."
2,Not a quality Bible!,"I am sorry to have to say anything negative about this Bible. First off let me say, the Tan Calfskin (and black one as well) cover is gorgeous.The problem is, everything else is poor quality. I had to return mine for a defective page inside of it. As it turns out, I understand that perhaps the whole run of new releases of this bible are defective. They have two-tone red and black calfskin covers, and the black calfskin as well. The pages on the inside are printed on the same paper as the $20.00 Bible! Also, the red lettering is badly mis-type set, almost double spaced. Some verses have no spacing at all, and overlap the preceding verses.There are also many blotches on the pages. (And I saw the same thing in DOZENS of these Bibles!)So, beware of this new release. (978-07180-2586-1)."
1,Bill,"This product is definitely not what was advertised. The bible was supposed to be in Calfskin, it turns out it was only in bonded leather. This is the first Bible that I have ordered from Amazon which was way below par."
4,Good place to start...,"Erickson's biography reads like a novel, full of descriptions of people and palaces, and political and social motivations. Though she doesn't analyze the politics in depth, there's enough background to have a basic understanding of the events that led to Marie's execution. A good, readable starter biography, and appropriate for young adults too."
2,A little disappointed,I was excied about this book but it was a little slow and drawn out. I found myself loosing interest in it actually. I was suprised because I usually like this author.
1,Lacks insight,I generally enjoy good historical fiction but found this one dull and devoid of insight.
1,Typical pop biography,"I never thought of Carolly Erickson as a first rate biographer, even though her ""Bloody Mary"" some years ago met with some critical acclaim. However, since her pulp novel ""Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette"" hit the shelves, I have lost all confidence in her as a historian. I read ""To the Scaffold"" and at first found it charming, with the loveliness of the young queen brought to life but then it descends into the same old cliche. The beautiful queen with the fat, indifferent husband who takes a lover out of boredom - this does not match with the information we are given about Marie-Antoinette in her letters to her mother and in the memoirs of those who knew her. Erickson chose sensationalism over facts. Anything to make a buck...."
4,Keith Murray & Erick Sermon's cosmic funk..................,Keith's unorthodox flow meets EDouble's hard funk grooves. Excellent.Loved:The Most Beautifullest Thing in This WorldGet LiftedPsychsomatic
5,WHOA!,THIS CD IS DEFINETLY HITTING! EVEN THOUGH HE'S NOT WITH US NOW HE'S STILL MAKING HISTORY! CHECK OUT KEITH MURRAY & JAMAL(FROM ILLEGAL)ON N.E.W.S. WITH A TRACK CALLED ALL MY DOGS! IT'S HITTIN LIKE WHOA!

3,ok conditon,Book was in ok condition but did have some rips and pageswere wrinckled.All in all it was ok but the only place I could find it and itis a cookbook that has been in my family for a long long time
1,Patchwork of existing articles,"I agree with inpip below, that this is an extremely dissatisfying and, in places, a factually inaccurate book. Nicole Kidman was never consulted by the biographers and all that she says or does in the book has been gleaned from articles in Vogue, Variety, etc. Being an admirer of Nicole's unsettling and haunting work in Eyes Wide Shut, The Others, The Hours, To Die For and The Portrait .., I was extremely disappointed to find that very little is said about the fact that she is, at the core, a thinking character actress and not really a garden-variety Hollywood star. This is what makes her art unusual and separates her from, say, Julia Roberts or Meg Ryan."
5,GREAT READ!,"I really loved this book. I just finished reading it and was disappointed it ended so soon. I didn't know much about Nicole Kidman until I read the biography. As I read it, I felt as though I was living her life; feeling her pain and joy. Whoever reads this book will love it! It truly is a great read!"
4,An Enjoyable Biography,"This is the only Nicole Biography I have ever read. It is written by two English authors. It is long and the print is small, so one must be prepared to spend some time reading it.It covers her childhood up through the time of writing. The authors seem to have done extensive research on Nicole, so appear to have covered all the bases. Her career is written about in great detail and there is sufficient mention of her personal life to keep the reader wanting more.It is not a juicy tell all, though, but instead very respectful of Nicole's privacy. I think one will be surprised to find out the kind of person Nicole really is, the breadth of movies she has done, and also how many of those movies were disturbing and/or quite sexual.An Enjoyable Biography!"
2,Lack of research,"I recently purchesed this book and was extremly disapointed to find things that weren't true.A one point it states 'Anne asks her mother when her father will return and Nicole as Grace replies""Daddy isn't coming home.you'll find out soon enough this place isn't always a happy home.""' When actually Nicolase asks 'when's Daddy coming home' to which Nicole then says when the war is over. She tells the servent first arrive she 'you'll find out soon enough this place isn't always a happy home.'I also found that in the book it quotes Anne Robinson to saying 'that looks like a twitch' at Nicoles attempt to imitate Anne,but actually Nicole makes that comment about herself.The aurthors showed no compassion to writing this book and there only driving force seemed to be the money.I found this book mostly disatifying and was saddened because Nicole Kidman is my favourite actress,this book doesn't do her justice.so enless you are a complete fan don't even bother reading this book!"
4,You need it to complete your collection of Horowitz,"His Chopin, there is a little bit of mannerism and too spontaneou. Well, even Liszt himself was a showman after all. Horowitz had to earn his living by concertizing before he was emotionally ready, and then having to flee from his motherland and later losing his only child and then the onset of horror for the stage... these all help to explain his demonic, which is so daring and sometimes even at the expense of the necessary emotional import, sometimes more amusing than touching...Horowitz is unique, too sensual perhaps, but never dry. Here Horowitz gave his best keeping the balance between mannerism and dryness. Better than most of his middle age recordings. First rate, no question about that. What is more, the audio sound here is excellent. Recommended."
5,Excellent healthy snack!,"I absolutely LOVE this dried fruit. LOVE IT. Whenever I have a craving for something sweet, I can usually rip open one of these bags and forget all about eating something bad.I've tried every one of their choices but this bag is my favorite. The apples and apricots are nice and sweet and the peaches give a little tang. The fruit is also nice and crisp, not stale and bland. I recommend this mix highly. Kids love it too so this makes a great lunchbox snack. Also wonderful for road trips."
4,There is great Wisdom here,"A perfect balance of Lao Tzu and Confucious.However there is a more elegant and poetic English translation under a different title is translated by Thomas Cleary:""Back To Beginnings"" (on Shamabala Publictions) though Cleary did selectively leave out some of the numbered meditations (and their numerical references).Note:Hong Yingming's Taoist mane is Huanchu Daoren.Get both books and understand the extent of the translator's art.If you read Chinese don't get Back to Beginnings get this version because it has English and Chinese side by side.One can learn from any version, this book is special."
2,katt williams,I love katt williams so I own all of his standup dvds. So it was very sad when I purchased what I thought was going to be a brand new special and it is just clips of everything I already own. I thought I was getting something new but I ddnt.
1,bootleg?,"I am highly disappointed in amazon. This was either extremely low budget or a bootleg of something else. I'm going to return this item. If you've seen it's pimpin, pimpin or the pimp chronicles, you've seen this. HORRIBLE!"
1,pimp legacy review,"It was a huge disappointment. We thought it was a comedy perfomance but ended up being some sort of documentary. Sure it may contain some funny behind the scene and never seen before footage, but it was not worth the price."
1,Katt Williams:The Pimp Legacy (uncensored),"I am a Katt Williams Fanatic....But this is bad! Don't buy it, if you have seen the other DVD's you have seen this one. Also, the picture quality is bad. I was very disappointed."
1,Terrible copy,"The condition of the DVD itself didn't appear to be a ""new"" copy like I thought I had purchased. It has many visible scratches on it, which caused parts in the DVD to freeze. The material itself was alright, not one of his best DVD's."
4,In agreement (...),"The Vallejo CA sound was started in my memory by The Click. They combine tales of slangin' rock with beats that sound like ""Cutie Pie"" or ""Computer Love"". It is straight West Coast but even Eastern rebels can groove to cuts like Bumble, Hillside, and Its All Bad. This is something different, because 40 has a way with the English language that has never been done before this. Hiphop is lacking innovators and E-40 is the definition of the word, Love him or Hate on him."
5,great cd,i had this cd back in the days and it broke got me a new one brings back memories. lovely cd.
2,YOUR JOKING !,"I HATE E-40,BUT THE TRACK WITH 2 PAC IS GOOD.THE 2 STARS ARE ONLY FOR THAT SONG.DON'T BUY THIS JUNK TRUST ME."
3,Flimsy and Overpriced,"I bought this for my dad and he informed me that the sock aid was not very strong and didn't help him at all. He also laughed when I told him what I paid for this, because this stuff would be cheaper at a local med supply store."
3,A better than usual compilation,"Compilations are always iffy things, but this one is so willfully weird you've got to give it credit...ending with a hilariously straight-faced new surf-tune from Chris Isaak (shades of Nick Rivers from ""Top Secret"", including spoken word bridge), ""MOM 3"" has a diverse a roster (James Taylor and Snoop Dogg on the same CD!!!)......a lot of good tracks, a few negligible items as well, but by owning this CD which mixes hip-hop, folk, funk, etc., you can impress your friends with your diverse attitudes, even if in secret you program out half the tracks!"
3,Mixed bag,"The version of Little Deuce Coupe with Brian Setzer is a lot of fun, and I really like Chris Isaak's Winter Waves. It's Isaak doing what he does best. The song has a spoken bridge, but it's not corny by any means. It would fit very nicely onto Chris's Baja Sessions album; it has that kind of relaxed feel. It's a short little ditty, but I like it a lot. Lisa Loeb's song Summer is also a good one. And Beck's song is super catchy!On the other hand, the stuff by Lit, Everclear, Jane's Addiction, and Smash Mouth are all horrible. A lot of throwaway noise.Definitely a mixed bag, with a few gems."
2,junk,this cd seems like it is going to be very good and the brian wilson and jane addiction are good the snoop is ok the pearl jam is terrible and the rest is just ok all and all forget this cd
2,that's not jim kelly's voice!,"after seeing jim kelly in 'black belt jones' i was looking forward to seeing this. this ended up being one of the worst movies i've ever seen. if you're bored, try counting all the cheesy zooms (after the first 20...it starts getting tedious.) the music is appropriately bad and the sound effects during the fight sequences seem to keep time like a metronome. all the voices are dubbed and you'll probably ask yourself why you're still watching.good for a laugh with a bunch of friends over."
4,BLACK BELT JONES 2 ? NEVER HEARD OF IT,"This typical Hong Kong 1970's kung fu flick has now been re-released as BLACK BELT JONES 2, although originally released as THE TATTOO CONNECTION.Obviously the distributers have called it BBJ2 to tie in with the popularity of the original movie.This movie is no BBJ but it's quite entertaining if you are a Kelly fan.The film is let down by a scene where a rather choppy fight scene goes horribly wrong,the illusion is ruined and the fight looks fake.What's more, Jim Kelly is hardly in this movie and looks a bit of a fool surrounded by all those unknown Chinese actors."
3,WOW!!!,"This movie, although made back in 1978 is a explosive action movie with adrenaline rushing scenes. Not much of a plot, as a gang-type group steel diamonds worth millions of dollars. Forcing the US to pay a ransom for their precious diamond. The Us sends a lone warrior [Jim kelly] to investigate the mischevious work of the gang leader[chen sing]. As Jim kelly get's closer to solving the case chen sing sends his hitmen [bolo yeung] to stop anymore info. Very good action movie with a little bit of comedy like Bolo Yeung singing.An allstar cast to say the least. Starring Jim kelly,Bolo yeung,Chen sing. Rated R for Martial arts violence,nudity,and profanity"
1,Careful!,"Hello, I started buying up Jim Kelly films like crazy cuz they are very funny! Tattoo Connection is no exception and provides great entertainment for a group of mates to sit about with a few beers taking the PXXS out of it. Tattoo conection is offered with Black Belt Jones 2 (The Tattoo Connection) as a double buy from Amazon... they are the same film!!!! It was re packaged as black belt jones 2 to sell more copys but it is not realated sos tear clear if you have one or the other..."
4,A book of historic value,"Haber and Einstein. If for no other reason than the personal direction these two men took in their lives, this book is of historic value. Haber pursued an illusion Einstein realized did not exist. I found Master Mind exciting and of lasting value. Daniel Charles' writing is beautiful as well as lucid. (...)"
3,Eh..,"Not bad, not amazing. Some good musicianship here but not too wild about the vocals. If you're searching for some amazing Christian metal, this isn't it."
3,Pretty good.,"This is good for a deput album. But still I think this album is a total slayer rip-off. And all the songs sound the same. But that doesn't mean I don't like it. This is a pretty good trash album, but nothing i haven't heard before. I have noticed that DJ TRY to sound like Slayer's Tom Araya on the ""fast"" songs. It just ain't the same. It's still a good album. Violence, Phargx Imas and Obstruction are the best songs. I won't say this is a must have, but if you're into trash then check it out."
2,Not Good Quality,"Two of the whole nutmegs were rotten and crumbled in my fingers, and all the others had a white moldy film on them."
1,This was not nutmeg,"I am not sure what was sent to me in the guise of nutmeg. This look like something which was pick up in the woods and painted, yes I am saying painted. There was no smell of nutmeg and certainly no taste of nutmeg. This was thankfully and inexpensive lesson learn."
4,Best fights scene's of the year! Not the best plot ever...,"Best fights scene's of the year! Not the best plot ever but who cares right that's how all teen action films are these days, 'xXx' with Vin Diesel . In fact I want to say that Jason Statham is the British Vin Diesel across sea's. Although he may not be as built, his physique is definetly the same and he is for surely much quicker. Also just like Vin Diesel in xXx and/or The Fast and The Furious he is very smooth with cars and women.To get to the point if you like action and don't care if the movie doesn't completely make sense get this. If not rent or buy something more like 'Get Carter' with Sylvestor Stallone or a James Bond movie that actually makes sense and has plenty of action."
1,Overblown BMW commercial.,"This movie makes so much out of the car that BMW must have bankrolled it. The story is secondary, and it looks liike it was made by a high school kid."
2,The Transporter,"If you like wild messy movies, this is for you. It had a barely descernable plot to support some very good special effects. Best viewed after a 6 pack."
