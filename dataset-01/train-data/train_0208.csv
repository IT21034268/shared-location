1,"It's ""art"", alright.","Leave the camera rolling for periods of time with no purpose whatsoever and beat the audience over the head with a hate-fueled ""message"", and you've got yourself a Haneke film.If you are one of the misled snobs who think Haneke's films are ""art"" or he's one of the most important directors like one of the reviewers below, get a clue."
2,Not a large variety,"The majority of these recipes were seafood and I didn't find much that appealed to me. I would have sent it back but was too lazy. However, I do think it would make a nice uncommon item to gift on a special occasion."
5,So Much FUN!!,"IT is so nice to have FORK ME, SPOON ME around the kitchen!! I hate all my cookbooks from Culinary school...so heavy...so boring! So nice to have such an easy to read, fun & ohhh so sensual cookbook now!"
4,Free range bully sticks,"I purchased these bully sticks online in order to try to save money (I have three dogs and we go through a lot of bully sticks!) My dogs loved these, though they didn't last as long (weren't as thick) as the other bully sticks that we usually buy locally. However, they are free-range!"
1,THESE BULLIES SUCK,"THESE BULLIES SUCK. THEY ARE CRUNCHY AND ARE GONE IN MINUTES, COMPARED WITH A QUALITY BRAND LIKE MOO OR OTHERS THAT LAST AND LAST FOR DAYS WITH MY DOGS. THESE ARE CHEAP AND PROCESSED DIFFERENTLY. I AM NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH THIS BRAND AND AM PLANNING ON RETURNING THEM."
2,Canine Reproduction: The Breeder's Guide,"A good basic book for beginners, but could use an update to include indepth information on progesterone testing and it's application in the breeding process. It could also use an explanation of current and more advanced artificial insemination procedures including transcervical insemination, and intrauterine surgical implant."
3,I Found this book to be very technical,This book deals more with the science of breeding rather than practical information. I was looking for specifics on things like How to know my bitch was ready for breeding and What to have on hand when puppies are born and How old are puppies when ready to be weaned. This book was too scientific for what I was wanting.
5,Purr pads Rule!,We have a senior cat who has arthritis and often gets cold. She loves the purr pad. It's hard to get where we live because there isint a petsmart here so I was happy when I found it on amazon.
3,Not So Great,"This soap smells a little like incense, which I don't find to be a bad thing. I do like that it lathers fairly well. Overall this soap just didn't make the cut for me. My skin felt REALLY dry after using this. I will probably stash them in my linens (I bought a bulk pack), because I do like the smell."
2,Doesn't really smell much at all...,"I'm really very disappointed with this soap. I've been scouring the stores looking for sandalwood soap. When I found this on Amazon and read the reviews, I gladly purchased it because I thought I'd found what I was looking for. Sadly, these soaps have very little smell at all and what little smell they do have disappears very quickly. I won't be purchasing this brand again."
2,Artificial and perfumy,"I was a little disappointed with this soap. It had a very artificial, perfumy, floral smell, rather than a rich sandalwood smell I would expect from Sandalwood soap. I'm not sure if this is by design and it's just a matter of taste, or if this is just a cheaper sandalwood soap, because I don't have a ton of experience with different brands."
2,Inconsistant?,"I think the other review that mentions inconsistency is probably correct; I've only purchased one box, and my own experience was that these had to go into a drawer quickly, because they smelled *so strongly* that it overpowered the room.The drawer has since remained shut; The soap will be thrown out if the scent doesn't subside between now and the next time that drawer opens. Either way, I won't be buying these again."
3,Okay perfume,"This perfume does smell clean but very un-natural. I was really going off of reviews here and don't get me wrong, the reviews are right. It smells clean like laundry but when I pull my clothes out of the dryer they smell not so harsh. I really hope this makes sense because this is a very fake clean smell. And the scent does fade really quick. REALLY quick. I feel that a scent should develop with you as the day goes on and you should catch fragrance bursts throughout the day as you move. After about 45 mn's this is completely gone. All of this being said it isn't a bad smell but once again, just a fake clean smell and it fades quick."
5,I got what I ordered,Seller had lots of positive reviews so I took a chance and ordered a bottle of Fresh perfume. It was listed for a much better price than in Sephora. The delivery was timely and I received exactly what I ordered in an unopened package.
3,A little too 'sweet' for me....,"Nice fragrance, but a little too sweet for me. I really like Clean Shower Fresh better."
5,Its fabric softner in perfume form!,"This really does smell like clothes fresh out of the dryer. I use it everyday before I leave the house.I have this one(Clean Fresh Laundry) and Clean Warm Cotton. The latter smells to strong, maybe I just haven't given it a chance but I love the laundry so much more!!"
4,Name describes it,This Clean has a definite fresh laundry smell. it is strong but that means you can use less of it. I love spraying the pillow cases with it. It lasts all day (and night). I like wearing this when I want to be all day lazy and just want to hang around. It is not a scent I would wear for romance or a pick me up.
2,disappointed in smell,This parfum did not smell in any way like fresh laundry on me. I was disappointed and expected more for the price.I was looking for a fragrance that was unique. This smelled just like all the other floral fragrances.
1,Lemon Pledge? Yes.,"I ordered this perfume because of the many reviews that said this smelled light and clean. I received it and couldn't wait to wear it. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in this scent. It smells just like Lemon Pledge. I absolutely cannot wear it bc it smells like a cleaning product. . .and it is so loud and abrasive. I even went to work to try to find someone to pawn this off on and absolutely no one wanted any of it. They would curl their nose in disgust and shrink away from it. I realize perfume is very subjective and I am sure others hate my very favorite perfume (White Gardenia Petals), but I did want to offer an alternate view."
5,Best and Most Comprehensive,"Absolutely the most comprehensive book on driving horses available. A ""must have"" text for the beginning and experienced driver. Focusing mainly on the workhorse vs. the pleasure driving horse, Lynn does outline the differences and explains the merits of both disciplines. He has served as an inspiration and an absent mentor through the vehicle of this book. Mr. Miller demonstrates how the horse can be not only a companion and a playmate but also a practical, functional part of our modern life. I hope to do ""all that"" and then some!"
4,atheletic supporter,"I am too old to be an athlete, but I am still an atheletic supporter.The older I get, the more I need this kind of support when I exercise."
4,Pink Reason,Prettier than your best friend's wife; uglier than your fever-induced nightmares.This is what Joy Division might have ended up sounding like if Ian Curtis would've taken a Xanax instead of taking his life...
1,Pure Garbage,"I can only testify as to the missing ships he writes of, as I have never researched the planes. But if his lack of research and misinformation is as bad regarding the missing planes as it is with the ships, the only thing this book is good for is the fireplace. One example: he has the ship Charles M. Price as 'mysteriously disappearing' on Lake Huron in 1913. What he totally neglects to tell the reader is that the Price (which didn't 'disappear'-the hull was found capsized with many of the crew washed ashore) was in what many historians consider to be the worst storm the Great Lakes have ever seen and appears to collected most of his material from one writer, and rather selectively at that. Many of the other ships which he alludes had 'mysterious' disappearances were actually victims of severe storms, which the author usually neglects to mention."
3,Intriguing space opera (especially for Deathstalker fans),"One thing I should say before I begin: I think Green's found his niche writing space opera. It's not really sf per se--it's more like fantasy in space, with science-fictional trappings. This isn't bad; I just thought I'd point it out.That being said, the three novels herein give some more background to the Deathstalker universe. They're fun reads--not terribly complicated, but fun. And some of the imagery is beautiful."
4,Big Beast book was big fun,"Not quite as far back as the dinosaurs, I was homeschooling my three younger children. One of the books we used for our studies was the Big Beast Book. When I was a child, I was deeply interested in dinosaurs and I was lucky enough to be living near Rapid City, South Dakota, home to the School of Mines, a school with a compact collection of fossils. In the 1950s no one mentioned lizard-hipped or bird-hipped dinosaurs, but The Big Beast Book did; it was a revelation. I was not only pleased to renew my acquaintance with dinosaurs, but tickled to find out new information.Although the book is simply illustrated, I didn't find that style to be a distraction. Many of the newer 'full color' photo-realistic books have so much detail that it all turns into background noise. Sometimes simpler is better."
3,So-so,"There is a LOT of great music here, there is no argument about that. It just seems like the same hand full of bands are scattered about 9 CDs. With 20 yrs under their belt, I thought this package would be a lot more diverse."
5,Good,"This box set is a metalhead's dream come true. If you want someone to get into metal, or if you want to get into metal, buy this first. Favorite bands here are GWAR, Metallica, Slayer, Six Feet Under, and Cannibal Corpse."
2,Mismatched Text and Illustrations,"Another of the My Body Science series, this one is also a disappointment. This book describes the composition and function of a scab, accompanied by simply drawn illustrations of children commenting on and showing off their scabs. The descriptive text doesn't really match the illustrations, which are rather abstractly drawn. For the level of description, I would expect near-photographic detail for accuracy of understanding. The entertainment value of the gross factor is the only thing going for this book, and the main text will bore the crowd that gets excited about that."
4,Not bad,"I'm a big fan of ""Everyone Poops"" and ""The Gas we Pass"" which are also by Yagyu. This book gives kids an excellent look into how their bodies react to cuts and what scabs are all about. Kids ask the darndest questions...and this book gives them some answers. Fun reading for the entire family."
3,"Good, but not great","Liked the other books of this genre, but this one misses the mark. Better for older kids than the 3 yr. olds."
2,Not the product listed,I received the new Jason Tea Tree and Cinnamon toothpaste instead. Product name and image are misleading and should be removed.
5,Very nice!,"I like it!! Better price than in the stores! Has a pleasant flavor, but I think I recall that the tube is small."
5,Cheaper than a class,"I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to familiarize themselves with Photoshop Elements. It was easy to watch, the person giving the lesson has personality ...not like some of them I've watched that put you to sleep. I think I learned a lot from this video. It was a lot cheaper than paying a couple of hundred dollars at the local university for a class. This way I learned from the convenience of my own home."
2,Common Sense Purchasing: Hard Knock Lessons Learned From a Purchasing Pro,"I perform the purchasing function for a small business. I thought this book would be helpful as an instruction manual for improving how our company makes purchases. It was not. The book was geared toward large companies with large purchasing departments. There was little to no instruction on how to actually improve how you make purchases, mostly how to tell staff how to follow company wide purchasing guidelines. I would not recommend this book for small business owners or those without large purchasing departments."
1,Don't waste your money,"Britney Spears is NOT a star. Her voice is terrible and she has no talent. It's not worth it to buy this, so don't."
1,Britney a star? I don't think so.,Britney Spears fails to live up to the hype of the teen pop craze. She fails to show any talent and her image is the only thing keeping her in the headlines.
3,"A strong CD, but not strong enough.","Of all the trance CD's I own I place this pretty high in my lists. For club music, it's a little soft but it has the right idea. This CD is much better for listining at home or with friends, not on the floor (this I onlt give it a 3). Huge slow spots between high energy beats can be a downer, but it does have a way of making up for it. When listining to this CD I usually work or play games (it's really a great CD for this) but I can't say I listen to it much on the dance floor (or have even heard it ever). Buy this CD if your life needs more background music, but don't expect to be raving to this (even though it does have some strong beats). If you strain, you might be able to groove to this one!"
1,BORING,"The chants on this tape were made quite a while ago so the sound quality is poor and the chants drone on and on and just aren't very lively, or even pleasant to the ears. If you want some wonderful chants go for Krishan Das instead..."
4,my daily companion,"Love this water bottle, it goes wherever I go.My only complaint is that it somehow soaks up stinky smells from time to time, all very different, even though I only ever drink water out of it. Not a big deal though - goes away with a thorough washing."
3,Too big for purse,"I had hoped it would fit in my purse, as I always have a bottle of water wherever I go. So I use it at home."
5,Great everyday waterbottle,"Great water bottle - take it to work everyday and then use at home when exercising. The little strap makes carrying it easy. The narrow mouth is much easier to drink from than the bottles with larger mouths and it's easier to wash than the bottles with built in straws. The 32 oz bottle doesn't look all that big, but I was shocked to find that it held almost twice the amount as my old bottle that was supposedly 24 oz. Durable plastic - this will last a LONG time."
3,"An Interesting Topic, But a Superficial Movie","There's a great documentary to made about the impact of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank on the Third World. Unfortunately, this isn't it. While many documentaries are one-sided, Black doesn't seem to have understood the possible responses to her apparent position well enough even to bother making a case against them. The strength of her argument suffers as a result. (An example: farmers complain about the high nominal interest rates of their loans, but the rates actually seem extremely reasonable given Jamaica's high inflation rate.) Nevertheless, the film may be worth watching simply to hear the perspectives of native Jamaicans, especially the interview with former Prime Minister Michael Manley (presented more fully in the bonus section of the DVD). Listening to the director's commentary may also provide valuable information that might have been better included in the movie, in place of the poetic-but-unpersuasive narration."
4,Very good movie,This is by far one of the best documentaries I have seen in a long time. It shows you what went wrong and how a lot of people are to blame including Jamaicans. I would recommend this film to my close friends and even strangers.
1,Foolishness!,"This film tries to place the current day problems of Jamaica with the IMF, InterAmerican Development Bank etc when every aware Jamaican knows that it was Michael Manley himself who set the socialist agenda in the 1970s which caused the greatest migration of educated, middle class, Jamaican's to flee the country.It was Manley's policies of 90 percent income tax and others which led to Jamaica falling at least a generation behind what its potential could have been.The films depiction of Manley as a victim of the IMF and Globalization is false and doesnt accurately critize the mismanagement and leadership of Manley."
1,zero stars if possible,"this movie is slanted and one sided. if you are looking for an education on how the IMF, World Bank or UN do business look else where. clearly the director hates america as she incinuates americans evil many times in the film and actually says we should be ashamed to come to jamaica and spend our money while people their are starving. i think this director needs a reality check and if she hates america so much go and live in france germany or england or any number of socialist countries and see how much more fantastic and utopian it really is."
1,Patronizing your audience?,"Stephanie Black has some nerve. She wants people to watch her documentary and them proceeds to insult them by chastising them for vacationing in Jamaica? Really? I agree with other negative reviews on this film in that Ms. Black has an agenda and that agenda is making capitalism and colonialism out to look evil when really it appears that socialism contributed heavily to Jamaica's economic downfall. And it's quite silly of Ms. Black to put down tourists who contribute their hard-earned dollars to Jamaica's economy. After all, Jamaica relies heavily on tourist dollars. I've been wanting to see this film for years but when I actually sat down to watch it I couldn't get though the first 15 minutes without feeling that Stephanie was wagging her big-fat-liberal finger at me. So I hit STOP."
1,Would you like to help ?,"This documentary blames the IMF for Jamaica's poverty, like if Jamaica was not poor before the loans. Like if so many other countries did not benefit from IMF's loans.Since you want to help why don't you invest your life savings in Jamaica and help create some jobs for the poor? The reason why you don't do that says more about why Jamaica is a poor country than any conspiracy theory."
5,Informative,"I really enjoyed this movie. After watching it in a class about the Caribbean, I bought it for my dad for Christmas and he absolutely loved it. I think it helped clear up some identity issues of his from when he was a little boy in Jamaica, and validate some of his feelings towards America. It was nice to be able to share this with him."
2,poorly made,The inside has a foam wrapper around the cheep rubbery material and it is not made very well. For a cheep fix it is not bad but it is not woth the price.
5,you forgot to call your agent,"why the criterion collection hasn't put this to dvd is less obvious than the overwhelming need to see roeg's first film. where else are you going to find gangsters who are out of the closet? jagger has a taste of everything in these rushes, an exemplification of experimental decadence."
2,"Strange, Sometimes Interesting",To watch this no sense footage just because Mick Jagger and Anita Pallenburg are in it should not be the purpose in watching this film.Might have more appeal if you've eaten some of the mushrooms and are having a hard time getting back to the planet.I preferred Mick Jagger in Ned Kelly.
5,Correction,Thank you for publishing my reviewPlease note: the last line of my review should read 'taut' and not 'taught'!
3,The Mick Jagger Fake Book,"I like this movie, like the music, the acting is good, the mushroom looks pretty. James Fox, Anita Pallenburg are very convincing. The Artsy psychedelic style is right up my alley. Mick Jagger is basically playing himself, is he fake or real? However, when it comes to cult classics, this film doesn't stack up with some of the better ones. If it's movie party time, I would probably pick El Topo, or Beyond the Valley of the Dolls or Eraserhead over this one. Sorry, Donald and Nick."
2,Not my favorite movie ever.,I bought this to fill out a gap in my collective memory about Rock and Roll bands. The movie itself is not a work of art.
3,a curiosity not a classic,"I purchased this movie more out of curiosity about how it would hold up thirty some years after my first viewing. As I suspected it would be, it was more a souvenir of an experimental time in our culture than an example of compelling filmmaking. Nicholas Roeg is nothing if not daring, and I did enjoy the film as a noble attempt, but I can't give it a ranking up with his two more exceptional films, The Man Who Fell to Earth and Walkabout. Mick Jagger is fascinating to watch, but more for his unique charisma than for the role written for him. The soundtrack contains some excellent songs rarely heard anywhere else, but the movie as a whole left me wanting a bit more depth of feeling."
2,ANOTHER OLD MOVIE,"ANOTHER OLD MOVIE???...WELL...YES, HOWEVER IT IS FUN TO SEE A VERY YOUNG MICK JAGGER AND HE PERFORMS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS ""MEMO FROM TURNER""...SO...IF YOU'RE INTO THE CAMPINESS OF OLD ROCK AND ROLL, YOU'LL ENJOY THIS TOO LONG AND SOMETIMES INDECIPHERABLE MOVIE."
3,So-so cult film with a few great scenes,"This is one of those films that is so odd and disjointed (it was, reportedly, edited down from three hours), So full of psychedelic blurring of what is usually separate and distinct that you either love it or yawn. I tended to find it a bit of a pretentious bore except for a few great scenes. The scene that is unforgettable is Jagger singing ""Memo to Turner"" out of sync with the record. The effect is disorienting and fascinating."
4,Loved it,It was as good as new and it had author's signature! Also had a letter by the author Felix Zandman
2,Very Interesting!,Zandman's historical part of this book is great. It gives you a great perspective of his life during the Holocust. More background would have been great. Got the feeling that his business associates have been less than desirable chaps.
4,a pretty decent book,i thought ths book was decent....................... im not reaLLY 13 but this way seemed easier................yeah its ok
3,A start,"A good intro for those who haven't read any semiotics or structuralism, but it will be boring for those who have read some of the theory. The main problem with the book is that the author is British and uses examples of British TV shows and magazines that the non-British (i.e. American for myself) reader will not be familiar with. One can still get the basic point of his examples, but it might have been better to use sources that were not so geographically isolated."
4,A great western for young people & winner of several awards!,"This is a timeless story by the author of ""Shane"". ""Old Ramon"" centers on a wise older shepherd, a young boy, and two brave dogs. Ramon teaches the boy, who is the son of his patron, how to care for a herd in the harsh terrain of the desert. The boy learns about sheep and sandstorms, rattlesnakes and wolves; he also learns about friendship and loss, bravery and cool-headed wisdom. Set in the Old West, where the cultures of Mexico and Southern California converge, ""Old Ramon"" offers both a journey back to the adventures of the past and a universal story of growing up. Has nice drawings too."
2,"Tomatelas, sui genris, y no volvas, manga de sunversivos hijos de putas!","A badly recorded DVD of a band 5 years behind it's time, that did a quite bad Crosby Stills and Nash imitation. It was the last Summer before the coup d'etat of 1976, which resulted in the end of innocence of the Argentine youth... or was it in 1982 in the malvinas war against the UK, Europe, the USA, and Chile? Goodbye Sui Generis, and thank you for the muzak... and don't come back!"
3,Passion wins every time,"It was almost a duty buy,strictly to fill in the gaps between the Stray Cats and the Orchestra. The wonderful surprise is that it's a solid, committed collection of songs. A touch New-Wavish and a bit 80s at times, it shows Setzer struggling for a post-rockabilly niche --- but the songs and the performance always win out. Cross Of Love,an obscure B-side,is a perfect example: how did this rocking, bone-crushing,melodic gem get so easily lost to pop history? And good luck getting Waiting For Desiree or Bobby's Back out of your head after a couple of listens. There really are some great tunes here."
3,Doesn't live up to it's billing...,"I'm a big Setzer fan, starting with the Cats and continuing through his brief solo and swing forays. But, I must agree with the review by Stephen Cribb, this album is not a very good collection of Setzer's output during this era. It's a more of a collection of hard to find material, rather than his best stuff from this time period. Frankly, I was quite disappointed with his first true solo album, ""Knife Feels Like Justice""... it's like he was trying too hard. But his second solo album, ""Live Nude Guitars"" was fantastic, and very underrated... IMHO, every song on that album was great and it was a crime that it wasn't widely promoted. ... There are a few songs from that album on this collection, but, if you want to hear Setzer at his best, doing straight rock and roll, neither rockabilly nor swing, buy ""Live Nude Guitars"" used somewhere...you won't regret it!"
2,Make out in Rome,"This movie was very boring. And while i understand the Olsens are getting older, they want to do more grown up material. Making out every 2 minutes in the morning is not the way to so it. The plot was unbelievably stupid. Even for an Olsen fan. I think if your a parent and want to get this, Its appropriate for kids maybe under the age of 12 as long as you don't mind them watching a lot of kissing scenes. Any kid older than this will be bored."
3,Not as Good as I would Think,"I've seen most of Mary-kate and Ashley's movies so I have to say this isn't one of the best. Winning London, Passport to Paris, Our Lips Are Sealed, The Challenge were much better then this movie. This movie is missing a lot and I mean a lot of action but I could say it would be kinda fun to watch but compare to the others it a downer."
3,The most boring film of Mary-Kate and Ashley's.....Better rent it...,"First of all, i have to say that i am a HUGE fan of Mary-Kate and Ashley, i watched most of their movies, but this one is just so.... I don't know what to say, it made me fell asleep.... I never fell asleep while i was watching a Mary-Kate and Ashley's movie.... This one is just really boring.... You'd better rent it instead of buying it, or you'll regret....><"
4,Hmmm...,"I've definately seen better movies than this one. I mean, the whole plot was, well, totally exciting! I would love to go to Rome, and I think the Olson twins are truly talented! I liked the movie a lot, but like I said, I've seen better movies, such as The Lord Of the Rings: The Two Towers, but this is one of the best MK & A movies yet! By the way, did you ever notice that Leila (or was it Charli?!) never kissed? That's a bonus!"
2,Typical,"Once again,this is quite an unrealistic movie, the typical Olsen twins movie theme is quite apparent- teenage girls galavanting in diffrent locations around the world, hence the title 'When in Rome'. I do believe their list of exiting new places to film their movies must be shrinking, just as my enthusiasm about their movies these days. Its been the same ol same ol for about 5 movies now- the girls travel to some vacation spot and find boys....puh leez...Spare me before they come out with a movie called ""Make out in Manhatten"" !! I just could not pay attention watching this one, its defenately not their best."
2,not bad,"you have 2 girls who are interning in italy for a job in fashion. They meet boys, mess up their intership and have fun. This movie feels like something from the 1980's. Very mild and laid back. Nothing fancy or exciting, just mild. I think it's time for the olsen twins to change when it comes to their movie stories. This is good for teens who need good role models.I will always admire them for staying so child like. You have to in a world like this."
2,Boring,"I am a BIG Olsen fan and love their movies,but this one-boring. I wached like 15 minutes of it and just turned it off. I only paed attention in that 15 minutes for only 5 minutes. No plot at all. And in the commercials-a frickin Scooby-Doo advertisment! With all those MKAA advertisments! yikes. I am GLAD we got it at the dollar store for $1 !!!!"
2,Big disappointment! :(,"I hate to be a downer on MK & A, because they are lovely and talented girls. But this movie was a huge disappointment. They must have used a completely NEW crew on this film! The editing was sloppy, the script seemed to be incomplete and out of order, and the scenes didn't even fit well together! It was honestly frustrating to watch. My little sister claimed she could have written a better script! Haha. But MK & A are still some of the best role models ever, beautiful, talented, and I am a FAN FOREVER! Let's just hope they can produce more films at the quality of ""Our Lips Are Sealed."" SIDE COMMENT: to w scott keigwin, if you had watched the behind the scenes on the DVD, you would have noticed that the ""fake accents"" were actually real! Most of the teens in the movie were literally from Italy, Germany, etc. So maybe they weren't so terrible at the accents after all, eh????"
2,Cheesy,This Movie Was Extremely Cheesy Movie. Not very good acting. Dissapointed. Not a good movie. The olsen twins other movies are good. I recommend Double double toil and trouble.
1,THIS MOVIE [IS BAD]!,"This was probably the worst movie ever. ALl of there movies are good except this, getting there, and winning london. DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE! They are actually kind of mean to some kid because he doesn't work. so what!"
2,"Like the twins, hate this movie","I can't write an in-depth review of this because I couldn't finish watching the DVD. I thought it was boring. It never went anywhere. The movie flips through a few coffee scenes and undelivered packages. I love Mary Kate and Ashley though. I've grown up with them since Full House. My favorite video was ""Holiday in the Sun"" which I felt had a better plot and numerous outfit changes. This movie was far too serious to be enjoyable, much like ""Winning London."" I'll still keep renting their videos, but this one was one of my least favorites, besides ""Getting There."""
2,Not expecting...,"I am not expecting much out of this movie. The other one - ""Getting There"" was bad. I read the plot of this one, and it sounds like all of the other ones. I was lucky enough to rent the other movie. I sugest you to do that. Enjoy!"
4,"Well,....","I live in Republic of Korea.so my english grammar has so many problems//;please understand it.Well, I have many Mary kate Ashley's Video.It is helpful when I studied English listeningbut this is same style of Mk Ash. (ex ;holiday in the sun , winning london)I want to MK & Ash are act different style movies!but I think it is helpful to Asian for study listening.especially I offer this video to Korean.I'd rather buy passport to paris.It is funny then When in Rome."
4,When in Rome...Olsen twins,"I saw this movie on T.V. one day and thought it was pretty good. It's fun and romantic like always. Cute Olsen twins fall in love again, only this time in Rome. Great footage of Rome itself. Great movie for sleepovers or group watching."
5,Great!,Loved the book...very informative and as easy read. I learned things about the Brontes that I didn't know before.
4,"A good guide book, and not just for wine","Another reviewer accurately described this book as an excellent guide for wine enthusiasts. It's certainly that, but I'd be tempted to recommend this book even if you're so-so about wine.That's because this travel book is straightforward and honest in its opinions; it says that the view from a restaurant is excellent but the food is only so-so, or just stick to their fish entrees. As a result, when the book does gush you know that it's sincerely meant, not an unrelenting PR spin about the expected tourist stops.The book isn't perfect, however. One thing it lacks (as do most other Germany guide books) is any sense of distance between places; an occasional ""only a 20-minute drive away"" would have helped immeasurably.We all have a limited amount of time available on our vacations; this book helped us use that time wisely."
1,This book was a major disappointment,"It merely restates existing Oracle documentation. There are not enough practical examples; only the installation portion was of any value. It is written around OWS 2.0, not 3.0. I actually got more assistance from the 2 chapters OWS in ""ORACLE How-To"" by Edward Honour."
2,Very Disappointing! No more than Oracle's documentation,I was very disappointed! This book simply restates Oracle's documentation. Very little was included that was not in the written or on-line documentation and much less than the Oracle course on developing applications with Oracle PL/SQL.
3,"not bad, not very good either","The book reviews the documentations that could be found on the web with the oracle user's manual without further pursuing more details or explainations. However, it's helpfull if used as a quick reference for the language.Emad."
1,"Spelling ""Scraper""","Of the three product selections, two spell the word ""Scraper"" correctly. This one is sold as ""Scrapper."" With no significant price variance, why should I be Motivated to purchase this one over the others?"
5,"Poet Richard A. Parks, Jr. - E-X-P-O-S-E-D!","Poet Richard A. Parks, Jr. pens poetry which swings the closet door of his personal experiences wide open. Exposed are some of the storms he survived, loves he lost and lessons he learned along his path to manhood.Someone Is Sleeping In My Head is definitely for those who believe that our brothers don't know how to communicate effectively. Richard A. Parks, Jr. disproves this theory as he invites readers into his head, his heart and his soul with his brilliantly expressed poetry."
4,A Blast from the Past,"Glad I could find this old LP on Cd. The jazz waltzes are great, but the Bosa Novas not so much. The Bosa Nova form has not aged well. The waltzes are well arranged and well performed."
3,Lots of good photos and a great forward by Ed Cole but there is little text to accompany the pictures,Nice pictures of early Corvair development and test cars/experimental cars but other than Ed Coles excellent foreword there is little in the way of text
3,ok.,"this shampoo is okay i guess,but i have alot of split ends!i switched from garnier to dove.i found better results with garnier!it made my hair soft silky and beautiful.it may be my hair,but i found no results in this product."
4,I like it.,"I like this shampoo. No issues. I think it is cheaper at local stores, but it was convenient to order online."
2,Allergy sufferers beware!,"Dove has traditionally been known for gentle products, but this shampoo caused major allergy problems for both myself and my daughter. This shampoo has a VERY strong odor, which caused intense nasal congestion for both of us within seconds after applying the shampoo. Furthermore, my daughter's cheeks became red and swollen about an hour after using the shampoo. She was still sneezing 2 hours after using the shampoo, and she finally felt better after we washed her hair (with another shampoo) and gave her Benadryl. My daughter's 11, and this is the first time she's ever had an allergic reaction to a fragrance. The smell also gives me a headache, so I have to keep my distance from other family members who use it.That said, not everyone in my family has problems with the smell (which is otherwise pleasant). However, I would be wary of purchasing this product if you are sensitive to strong fragrances or have sensitive skin."
3,"A ""charging"" set, not a synching cable","I was glad to find such an inexpensive charging set, but the USB cable seems to work only as a charger on my computer. I have not been able to transfer data from my computer with it. True, I didn't have to spend a lot of money, but I guess you get what you pay for..."
5,The Celtic music of Asturias,"This is a great CD that showcases the Celtic music of Asturias. The folkloric music from this region is much harder to find than that of Galicia, so this is an excellent chance to hear a different style of Spanish Celtic music. Highly recommend!"
1,Looking for the Spanish millenium folk group,"Interesting: Iam also trying to track down the name and recordings of the Spanish (maybe Basque, maybe Galician) group of 5 musicians including indigenous bagpipes, accordion, guitar. Please contact me if you find this information. email at alevett@iafrica.com"
1,bag pipes of spanish asturias,"I made a mistake .I was trying to locate the young female piper that was featured on the spanish millenium celebration on pbs . If you know her name or title of her cd ,please contact me at tauld74804@aol.com thanks"
5,great1,I purchased this for my daughter for xmas and I was pleasantly surprised.Her IPOD slids right in and no cords to fool with. The sound was nice. It was well worth the price. I would recommend this to everyone!
1,unfortunately I agree,"Whether Grant is an ""overlooked military genius"" is in itself a doubtful premise - however, this book was very disappointing - lacking depth, analysis, insight or the kind of narrative writing that can render even a well known subject interesting. The complexities of the Civil War are great - just the two months of March and April 1864 alone are worth a book in Grant's career. This is just too simplistic of a book to be taken as serious or even enjoyable reading."
3,To the victor goes the spoils,"Towards the end of the war Grant was losing 5000 troops per major engagment. Mary Todd Lincoln called him a butcher and wanted him removed. Abe wanted to end the war. Grant made no bones about his motive. To crush the south, and he did. I wonder if it was because he knew that sacrifice was necessary and with the Northern industrial complex behind the logistics and a draft in full swing (whew)... at that point Lincoln finally had a General who had the will to win at any cost. He could have won with one hand tied behind his back... the south was in poor shape. Yet Lee managed to give back worthily at just about every juncture, save Petersburg and the rear guard action into Appomatox. Was the book that good? No suprises here."
4,brandy the starr,well what can i say.....i think this album is sooo good its exactly what brandy is about with this mix of songs keeping every1 including new brandy fans happy...buy it ..u won't be disappointed. on the first few traks brandy sticks with her rhythmic normal self...but then it just gets better and better proving that this r'n'b starr is here to stay and she aint goin away
3,Not worth the price,"The fabric is really nice and soft and a beautiful color. However, it came with two straps and was outrageously tight. I don't have a large head either. I ended up cutting one of the straps off and it works ok."
2,BEWARE-Live Recordings of Varying Quality,"The sound quality of these recordings are all over the place. Some are great, others are just too horrible to bear. Most are somewhere in between. If you are looking for studio versions of the hits look elsewhere."
2,"This book and wine, go together.","as I said, wine and this book make a good meal. First bake the book at about 350 degrees in an oven, and then take it out, let it cool, just a little, and then smother it with lots of good CHEESE and some yummy tomato sauce, and whatever else you care to put on it. and then just dig in, and munch! It makes a great after ""Norm"" snack. Try it. but note: it will give you a bad case of indigestion, if you eat and go to bed right afterwards. so, make sure to stay awake and up for a while, to avoid this symptom. OK? Oh,...read this book? Naa! Don't think so! but as a snack, hey, what have you got to lose? ;-) wink."
2,"A few ideas, but not worth it","This book sparked a few ideas for me, but I don't think it's worth it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know. There was a lot of fluff and not much do this do that which is what I was looking for. If you've only had a few encounters it may be ok for you. Otherwise you've already learened anything she has to tell you."
3,Nothing a little common sense and imagination can't fix.,"After reading this book, I felt it was mostly a common sense approach. It was nothing that your own imagination couldn't come up with if you are already into romanticism and fantasy play. If your lover is a total cold door knob, then this book is definitely for you!!! Good Luck"
3,Review,"This is at the crux of what I need to do. Whilst it is an excellent beginners guide, it would benefit from a glossary of commands and another chapter stepping through linking to and populating other office applications."
5,A Unique Approach To Learning Visual Basic,This has got to be one of the best out there to get you going with Visual Basic. A unique approach that spoon feeds a beginner the process of developing and building a visual basic program. Jerry Lee Ford teaches you from the ground up and in a very simple way. You will be proficient following his lessons and examples. Wow. very impressive!
2,Good Book - Many Problems,"I really want to like this book. The explainations are good. The projects are nice and game oriented so they keep your attention. However, the book has a large number of mistakes in the text. Especially in the code you need to follow.Also, the author totally misses on showing off Object Oriented Programing. He gives a decent showing of what OOP is, but the project that comes in that chapter lacks the creation of any Classes. I was really liking the explaination of OOP, but you get nearly no experience of it from the project.This book had a lot of potential, but misses."
5,A very practical guide to T-SQL programming!,"This is a very concise and to-the-point book. It assumes that the user has a basic understanding of T-SQL. So, you won't see any repetition from SQL Server Books Online.Authors chose very interesting topics, and backed them up with real life scenarios and practical examples. So, every example makes sense.Book is very easy to read and understand. If you are a beginner T-SQL programmer (or someone coming from a VB or other programming backgrounds), this book helps you get on the right track, as it clearly explains how to think in terms of sets. If you are an intermediate level SQL programmer, you can really use the examples provided in this book and start your journey towards becoming an advanced SQL programmer. For advanced users of SQL, this serves as a great reference."
1,A bad book,Bought this without reading the reviews. Big mistake. Full of terribly simple examples and bad English. Not worth the time at all. Don't know where they get some of these authors.
1,The Expendable Spy,"Jack Hunter did a fine job with THE BLUE MAX but this book was so bad it was one of the few times I just stopped reading and donated the book to the library. The hardcover edition I purchased even had pages missing! The publisher is shown to be ""Replica Books,"" and whomever did the editing should be fired. Missing pages! Incredible!A convoluted story which never really got my attention."
4,The Lions Game,"Fast moving thriller....explicit violence at times ..but a really good read.. . Also enjoy the nextbook in the series ""The Lion"" as the thrills continue to excite."
5,The LIon stalks his victims,The Lion's Game by Nelson Demille is a thoroughly enjoyable read. It's a case of the Ram (a lamb with horns) hunting the Lion who is more elusive than you might have conjectured and thoroughly cold blooded driven by revenge. The Lion is a terrorist avenging the death of his family which occured in a US Bombing raid over Lybia. The ram with horns is played by a retired NYC Cop with a sense of humor and an inquiring mind. Do yourself a favor and read this suspensful book.
4,Keep an open mind,"We'll what can be said that hasn't already been said. This is a half decent bigfoot movie. Yes, it's ""teens get slaughtered""! yes it's a little dated but it's still fun' I agree with other reviews that there is too much monster and when you do get a good look it's some what reminisant of a kabookie mask.It's good value for money and a great way to scare tweenies with the family, though one scene is a little violent it's almost comic book humour in its ""over the topness"".It's fun, worth the money and the gag reel is worth a look too."
4,Suprisingly good!,"Low budget horror can be good. Who knew? After the garbage that fills Blockbuster (especially those cheap Asylum ""movies"") I went into this movie and didnt expect much, and was suprised to find this movie entertaining. Definitely worth a rent."
4,scary fun,"Abominable is an appropriate title for this movie. Gory and entertaining, just turn off your brain and enjoy!"
2,It's Abominable all right!!,"I love creature movies, and I knew about this one but waited untill someone would sell for under $5!!Finally picked one up for only $3!!To say the least, I did not like this movie.It was predictible, I could barely recognize Jeffery Combs, and it features 3 of the most obnoxious, annoyingbubble headed girls I have ever seen!! I kept hoping the creature would put them out of my misery ASAP, but keptwaiting, and waiting......I did think the creature looked pretty cool, that is the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one!!"
3,Better than I thought,"I went into watching this movie not knowing what to expect other than a Sasquatch horror movie. After watching the movie I do have to say that I'm pleased at owning this movie the effects are good even if it's a low budget movie but it makes up with the writing. I don't watch many Sasquatch movies but this is probably one of the better ones that I've seen at least in the horror category, I've seen a couple others that couldn't live up to this movie. Overall this movie gets a solid 3 stars out of 5."
3,I saw this movie..,Its not the best movie but its not the worst. it came on sci fi one night. and it makes bigfoot totally opposite than what he/she really is.. juss watch it for yourself. but they couldve made the movie a little bit better..
1,Not scary at all!!!,"It looks like a movie made in the 80's, the special effect is terrible,everyone is dying to be killed, most actings are silly.Wondering why Jeffrey Combs and Lance Henriksen co-starred in this quite bad movie.Disappointment!!!"
4,Gory Garguantua,"""Abominable"" is a welcome surprise - a well-made horror film that isn't too slick and doesn't devolve into a glorified episode of ""Goosebumps."" Matt McKoy delivers a very sympathetic portrayal of a Jimmy Stewart-like character who witnesses and tries to prevent a series of murders by a Bigfoot-like monster.There's some very good acting in here (courtesy of numerous B-listers you will recognize), decent dialogue, a well-stretched budget, mostly effective music and a surprising amount of old school gore. If you enjoyed the sort of effects Tom Savini is best known for, you will enjoy some of the more gruesome and bloody deaths splattered throughout this movie. Honestly, if you like gruesome and well-crafted horror, you will enjoy this movie.The real mystery here is why on earth wasn't this given a theatrical release. It's far scarier - and better made - than the endless horror sequels and remakes we're asked to see."
4,Bigfoot Fan,"The title say ""Abominable"", but it really should be ""Bigfoot"". The movie was actually pretty good although the ""creature's"" costume needed to be a little more believable."
3,bigfoot rules,I throught the violences was funny and that the movie was comical. But for the age of the movie and there budget it was quite good for a bigfoot movie probably one of the best.
4,Samurai Made Real,"The author of 'Shinsengumi', Romulus Hillsborough, is regularly criticized for his dry writing style and poorly worked out theories. It seems unlikely that Hillsborough has any training in history whatsoever. His book on Ryoma Sakamoto, in fact, is miscatagorized as 'history' (it is 90% dialogue, and the average reader will be able to spot it as historical fiction within four seconds of opening the book). 'Shinsengumi: The Shogun's Last Samurai Corps', however, is a very interesting read. By focusing on one historical period, Hillsborough not only fills a gap in available Japanese history literature in English, he is also able to avoid the 'long tradition' sameness of most collections of samurai tales. The samurai in this book, though often less than admirable, are therefore much more real than most."
2,Japanese History,This was a hard book to get through. Should have read a sample of the book before buying.Did not care for the writing style.
3,Full-screen detracts,"Must Love Dogs is presented full-screen, which is frustrating nowadays when so many of us own widescreen TVs and laptops. Plus Must Love Dogs isn't that good. You're better off just buying You've Got Mail unless this is cheaper."
4,"loved You've got mail, didn't like Must love dogs",You've Got Mail is a classic romance movie. Really didn't care for Must Love Dogs.
5,must love dogs/you've got mail,I was simply amazed and very happy and the promptness of delivery and excellent condition of product...would buy again from this vendor.
5,Important book,You rarely find such great books anymore. I highly recommend it to every parent and I hope there is an audiobook version of it
4,Great easy tips easy to reading,"Very catholic focused on values and with practical tips...I have been to his workshops, very good reading that talks about practical issues, spanking a child , punishments, parents temper, etc"
5,Textbook Brilliance,I use it as a textbook. There are are no cross references to this masterpiece. Deem it a classic!
5,Still relevant,"A must read if you want to know about Nazism and the powerplays of the Nazi stalwarts. Very detailed, very informative and frightening.Too bad the author is dead. He could have updated this book with all the newly released information; especially from the former Soviet Union."
5,Finally!,"I had almost given up on my hope of getting this one on my kindle ... recently my pre-order for it had been cancelled ... but now it is here. There are lots of different perspectives in various works about the war, but this is one of the best in my opinion ... presented by someone who was well positioned to observe the progression of events that led to what became the greatest of all cataclysms ... and well written to boot. Thanx Amazon! :)"
3,Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,"I have not really gotten into this book yet, due to a malfunctioning Kindle, but it appears to be well researched. Sorry I cannot give a better review at this time."
4,What I realy need is a Cliff Note's Version,"I had the hope that this would be easier to read than my paper back copy. The problem is in me, not in the electronic version of the book."
4,WWII History Buff,"As a WWII history buff, learning Hitler's early years and build up to his rise within and to the 3rd Reich was made very interesting and sequential by the author."
4,Still important - a MUST read for anyone trying to govern in today's world,"Shirer's book is still very important to this day. Even several decades after hitler attempted to destroy the world, this publication provides the best assessment of the face of tyranny. We can, and must, assess current events using Shirer's definitive assessment of exactly how hitler climbed into the seat of power. We must use this as a guide to help future generations take on - and defeat - future attempts by evil when it raises its ugly head. We must still look this history in the eye and use it to prevent another outgrowth of tyranny when it comes - and it WILL come again..."
2,"Five star book, one star Kindle edition","This is a great book for not only its detail, but also the unique perspective that the author provides. Every stage in the history of Germany during the mid twentieth century is explored in fantastic depth. The Kindle edition however appears to have never been edited. Typographical errors occur frequently enough to distract from the text. There are also numerous footnotes that are not active, or lniked to other citations making them inaccessible. It is a shame that this was offered in such a condition, it has made me far less likely to purchase Kindle editions of older works."
5,You just need to read this single book to know the history of 3rd Reich!,"I read the Chinese version of this book in college within two weeks, back to 1994. I had never finished a book with more than 300 pages, except course textbooks. This is the first book that I had read through every sentence, and it has some 1200 pages! Three years later, I read it the second time and still felt fascinated.It gave you a thorough view of the third Reich in an amazing detail and true objective view. Here you can find how and why German people chose Hitler and the country embraced Nazism at the time. Definitely the best history reference for the third Reich.To have a thorough view of the Nazi Germany, you just need to read this book. All others are waste of time."
5,Third Reich revealed,"While I have not quite finished this book, I highly recommend it to anyone interested in history in general and the Second World War in particular. The author was personally present during that time and witnessed many of the events first hand. It is a very long book, but well written, covering in detail the period from the end of WW I through the end of WW II. It has given me vastly greater insight into the period and the events surrounding the entire Nazi movement. Most fascinating are the intimate portraits of the major characters in Germany as well as those from Britain and France."
1,"I did not realize version did not include maps, photographs etc.",I did not realize the version of the book I purchased did not include maps and images but was just plain text.
2,"Excellent book, needs a copy editor","As many others have said, the book is excellent, but the copy editing is terrible.Far too many typos, and the footnote system is abysmal.Hopefully, they will update a corrected copy, with footnotes inserted into the text body.If they do, I will update my star rating."
1,The five stars is for the book and not the kindle edition,"This was loaned to me by a friend, so I can't say that I paid for it, but if I had I would be upset. I read this for a class in high school and was blown away by the detail and yet how intimate it was. This is one of the best histories ever done in my book.The transfer rates as one of the worst, however. Wrong words (see other reviews to get a better understanding of what this means), choppy chapters, and the like. This begs for someone to come along a proof read this one."
3,Good To read but graphic details are too gory!,"The book i rate it as three stars because, the details are too graphic and it made me vitually impossible to proceed beyond the next half of the book!...any sensible human does not have patience to enjoy one brutality after another..the author dramatized the events and in the later half was devoted to the brutalities of nazi's in the concentration camps. Instead of that if attention was devoted to the other associated events..this book would have been more readable!..any way good book untill middil.."
3,"A great source of info, but readers, ye be warned","This book would have received 0 star from me had it not for the mounmental effort, and result, of the auther's research. For that part, a very very big hat, way-off my head, to Mr. Shirer.Otherwise, this book is just another example of subjective, shallow interpretations, blinded by Mr. Shirer's personal connection to the topic, of the complex factors that unfortunately, led to the Nazi party's rise to power after WWI in Germany.Not to undermine the horror suffered by the Jewist community during the Holocaust; but at a time when even the babyboomers are receiving senior welfare checks, it's time to give the current Germany, and its good citizens, a BREAK!For those interested in the cultural aspect of the same period, I highly recommend The OrientalistThe Orientalist: Solving the Mystery of a Strange and Dangerous Life. Put these 2 books together, you should get a fairly objective understanding of what took place.Clara Lo"
5,Excellent,"Despite its heft, as of the time of this writing I am reading Rise and Fall for the 4th time. It is a compelling avalanche of information. A must read for anyone who lives in, and wishes to try to understand, the post-Nazi Germany world."
5,Excellent book,"Even though this book was written quite some time ago (1960's) it is still highly readable and an excellent overview of the Nazi regime. Shirer is an excellent writer and brings to life the origins of the Nazi movement, the war and the various German generals. Though you may have learned much from the endless media exposure to Hitler and the Third Reich, this book really is a scholarly overview written in layman's terms that will provide with interesting insights into Germany and the war. There are a few areas where the expressions are dated, but overall this book really holds up and despite its length (over 1100 pages) is a pretty quick read for such a long book. It really makes me want to learn more!"
5,A True Masterpiece,"One cannot claim to understand the terror of Nazism until they have read this book. Shirer does a magnificent job of examining the rise of Hitler, arguably one of the most evil men who ever lived. He was so astute in gathering like minded evil men to his inner circle while convincing the German people to accept him as their leader--while the rest of Europe and the US failed to recognize the magnitude of the threat until it was too late. This book comes as close to answering both the ""how"" and ""why"" questions of the rise of Nazism. The author keeps us in constant suspense as the Brown Shirts rise and fall, the SS comes to prominence, and Hitler comes to power supported by a disgracefully servile military leadership. The political and diplomatic treachery that follows is mind boggling. It is shameful to note that the German people supported Hitler all the way, even to the end! A very worthwhile reading effort!"
4,Great read!!,Some what terse in details near the end of the book. specifically regarding the russian armies in approaching Berlin. On another note some detail lacking on the Italy campaign and German army in the budapest sector.
5,A must read for anyone interested in this era,"I had put off reading this book being intimidated by the length. I also feared that it would be extremely dry and boring. I'm happy to say that it was neither of those. This is very well researched and very well written. You get a real sense of all the history before during and a little after. It put so much of what I had already read into perspective. If you read nothing else about this time period, read this book."
4,The Rise and Fall of 3rd Reich,This book is hard to get started in but once you get the characters defined it is easier reading. I had fogotten a lot about Hitler's rise to power. It is hard not to make a comparsion to our own events that are happening in this country. It seems that history does repeat itself every so often. The more yuou kknow about history the more it seems that we never learn the lessons from previous history. A must read!
4,"Well written, and eye opening","I liked this book because it is factual. The author did remarkable research. I would recommend this to anyone who lived through the second world war, or anyone who would NOT want another war."
5,Detailed review of WWII from a Germany perspective,"I am not usually a history buff, but Shirer really brought to life the events of WWII Germany - the highs, the lows, and everything in between. Through colorful & descriptive narration, Shirer puts the reader at the scene, to experience the history of Nazi Germany during the time of the war, as if the reader were actually there. The book is thorough, thus the many pages, but it is definitely worth the read!"
2,Overrated,"This book is journalistically interesting, and that describes both its strengths and its weaknesses. This is not history - it is journalism. There's a difference. Shirer was a journalist and this book is a compendium of his impressions while working in Berlin during the 1930s. Like much journalism, it manages to be entertaining, but is essentially shallow. For depth, I would suggest Hitler's 30 Days to Power by Henry Ashby Turner, or Hubris, by Ian Kershaw. For the casual reader, this may be sufficient, but it is a light read."
5,Recommended Reading,"This book is recommended for anybody who wants to read the inside story of the rise and fall of Hitler and Nazi Germany. Although World War Two itself is covered extensively on television and in books, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich covers everything that happened during ""the rise."" Fascinating look at how Europe, and particularly Germany functioned before and during WW2."
5,"in great shape, as represented",thank you for selling me this product in great shape as you said you would. i also received it quickly.thank you
3,Engaging in style,"I found Shirer's book very entertaining to read as i did his Berlin Diaries, but not too useful as a historical source. After all, Shirer was a journalist by trade rather than a historian. It tells a pretty good story (with some exaggerations here and there) and is a great who-is-who book of the Nazi era too. If you are interested in the history of this period it is a good introduction, but do consider looking at other sources before you make up your mind about some of the topics."
4,Making WWII readable,"Written in a nice narrative format, this book is big but easy to read with nice back ground for all the events. The only negative would be its a bit heavy on the Nazi hate. Yes, yes, the Nazis were way bad, it just starts to get a bit heavy so that it can distract from the history."
5,The Rise & Fall of the Third Reich,"If you ever wanted to know how National Socialism came to power this is the book. It covered areas that are not common knowledge particularly the interaction between Hitler and Foreign leaders in the years leading up to World War II.It will leave you wondering what would the world have been like if Hitler had not opened the Eastern Front with a war with Russia, or if Britain and France had moved against Germany in 1937 or 1938. Would it have been Europe controlled by Germany and Russia with Britain and the US neutralized and at the mercy of Germany, Russia, Italy and Japan or could early action have cut off the rise of the Third Reich.This is a must read for anyone interested in WW II history."
3,"Good, but a bit outdated.","Despite the exhuberance of the other reviews, I suggest potential readers think twice before reading this particular work. Shirer's arguments are outdated on certain subjects and the book really drags in some places. There are several other histories of the Third Reich that tell the story more effectively and in less time. That said, I enjoyed Shirer's book and his coverage of the major battles (especially Stalingrad) is dramatic. Those willing to invest the time to read it (1400 pages! ) will be better for it."
5,More than just history,"""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" is one of my all time favorites. It is not just history but it feels more like a thriller revealing the plots as you read it on. The most remarkable fact is that it is based wholly on facts. Hats off to William.L.Shirer for preparing a book like this. Imagine how he would have consolidated all the facts. The book has quite a good no. of pages(more than 1100). It takes some time to finish it but still it is worth the time spent on it. If any one is interested in the history of Germany under Nazi rule and the insides and outs of the role of Germany in the Second World War then this is the right book. Moreover it also covers enough details of the character and life of Adolf Hitler. Overall one will not regret spending time on this book."
5,Capitivating History,"This book is one of the most dog-eared books in a small collection of books devoted to the WWI time period in history because it has been read and re-read many times.William L. Shirer captures the times in a way only one who lived through them can possibly do. It struck me as odd at first how interesting reading about history can be, when one already knows the outcome of the story. But there are lessons to be learned from repeated readings and Shirer does a great job making sure that the reader does not put the book down for long. The footnotes are well done and provide an even greater in-depth look into the events that were unfolding on the pages before you. Shirer is careful to avoid opinionated writing and sticks to the facts as they are known to him like a Captain sticks to his plotted course. Two thumbs up!"
5,Ubermonkey says thumbs up!,"THE GOOD: This entire book is awesome - a must have for any history/WW2 buff, or anyone who is just a fan of great literature. Shirer writes the war in an informative and entertaining way which captivated me and kept me turning pages (ignoring that there were like 10,000 pages to turn!) I absolutely loved this book and have reread it until the pages fell out. This is the definitive book on WW2 from beginning to end.THE BAD: Nothing about this book is bad.THE UGLY: Absolutely nothing.Ubermonkey says that there are tons of books which cover the WW2 era. But without a doubt, none of them cover it like this."
3,The Rise and Fall of the Thirad Reich,This book is long and difficult to read. However for those of us born in the 20's it reminds us of the things that were going on as we were growing up and becoming adults. It is a worthwhile read
2,Abridged edition,"Seller shipped abridged edition instead of full edition. Description didn't specify. Seller contacted me and asked that I let them know if there was any problem before rating on Amazon. I did, and even offered to pay for the full edition. Seller told me good luck on my shopping and made no offer to find or replace with correct edition."
4,Not as advertised,"I read the original edition in 1962 when I was in High School (we were allowed to read anything we wanted to in study hall except comic books as long as our grades were good).However, the Kindle edition, which appears under the entry for the 50th anniversary edition, is in fact the 1961 edition, and lacks the Rosenbaum introduction, which I was specifically looking forward to reading.This is a great work of history. I just wish the new edition were available for Kindle."
2,"Unless you have no life, do not read this book.","i was made to read this book for a class i am taking and it was torture. i didn't understand a word of it, it was way too long, and just plain not enjoyable. unless you are a nazi enthusiast i do not recommend it!"
5,"""The Third Reich""","An excellent price for this huge paper back! I have read the first book and find it very enlightening. Hitler is described as an orator, a propagandist, and an organizer. Maybe a bit too much like someone in today's world? Scary...."
5,Rise and fall of a monster,"I was well and truly satisfied with my purchase of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany. It arrived well within the timeline promised in good condition. Thanks, guys.David W. McPeak"
5,Disappointment and shock.,"Definetely, a great Anti-War book. But I was shocked to read some fo the comments on the cover of the book made by well respected, newspaper people, referring to this great, sad, very sad and truthful book, as ""witty and hilarious""; ""one of the funniest books of the year""; ""most original and humorous writer living"". There is not one, not even one funny thing in this book, but horror and tragedy and misery and darkness, all men made maladies being repeated over and over and over again. Nothing funny about it. I find it hard to believe that the writer, who was sensitive enough to write this great book, actually agreed to have such despicable comments about his book to be printed on his great book."
5,#1 book of all time,"This book had the most impact on my 1940s and '50s childhood. I grew up with it, looked at it time after time, pondered it, felt it. Who said ""A picture speaks a thousand words""? James Thurber had a wonderful silent way of reaching the heart. I recommend this book to all parents with children, and to all grown-ups. Of everything I have ever read or seen, this is my #1 book of all time! Please have it out on your table always!"
5,I REMEMBER THE LAST FLOWER,"I have wanted to get this book for many years now. I read it while going to college. It is a story that has been in my memory for a very long time. It was a shock for me to see (after I read it) that it is much longer than I remember it to be, even though it is short as books go. It is a sad story. Let's hope that things don't work out the way that Mr. Thurber tells us they will. But maybe that's the whole idea: for us to read THE LAST FLOWER, then make sure that its ending doesn't happen. So, everyone, buy the book, and you can help out."
4,Go for the Pelican 4300 Nemo instead.,A smaller version of the very bright Pelican 4300 Nemo. Light output is not as great but smaller & more compact in size. Uses less or half the battery of the larger Pelican 4300 Nemo.
5,Emphasizing intellectual exploration and contemplation,"Stanley Moss' A History Of Color is an impressively presented and highly recommended poetry anthology emphasizing intellectual exploration and contemplation. Subtle shifts of mood distinguish the free-verse reflections on the absurdities and contradictions of life. The Return: It was justice to see her nude haunches/backing toward me again after the years,/familiar as water after long thirst./Now like a stream she is, and I can lie beside/running my hand over the waters, or sleep;/but the water is colder, the gullies darker,/the rapids that threw me down have shallowed;/I can walk across."
2,"Lots of Countries, Little Information","I have been a faithful consumer of Lonely Planet products for the last five years. However, this collection does little more than offer superficial information on every country in Central Europe. If you want to go anywhere besides the capitals and most well-known tourist ""traps"", forget it. I was particularly dissapointed with the book's treatment of Germany and Switzerland. Very vague, very minimal. If you want to visit any of the countries in Central Europe, buy the Lonely Planet Guide to that country or look for a different publisher. Sorry guys, this one doesn't go in my travel bag."
4,Really soothing!,"I am new to this genre of music. The music on this CD is slow paced and I find the selections familiar, romantic and relaxing. I listen to it over and over again."
2,Falls short of expectations,"While this book shows incredible detail in the images of lacework, it does not provide a single word on the sources or dates of the lace pieces. This book will provide inspiration for lacemakers or designers (not patterns!) Historical costumers or reproduction lacemakers who require documentation for their work will wish to pass by this resource."
3,Only good for referencing....,I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately the images in it were a bit low res or a bit blurred. I was hoping to scan some of the images so I can use it as decoration in my illustrations. Too bad the quality is not great. 3 out of 5 stars for me.
2,"ANOTHER ALPHA VIDEO ""CLONE"" PRODUCT","About eight years ago I bought a DVD collection from a publc domain company calledBuyer's Gallery out of Canada. They sold their silent Tarzan films in three separate sets each .The quality of the original sets I bought were quite good but I was hoping that with this one, seeing the packaging was so well produced, that the product inside might be better as well. After the watching the set it did not take long to realize frame per frame ""IT'S THE SAME FILMS"". It's obvious where it was ripped from.The same can be said for The Son of Tarzan Series and their Tarzan The Tiger which I also bought and feel cheated on. Identical to my original Buyer's Gallery versions, right down to the flaws and edits.Needless to say I'm beyond disappointed. But being puiblic domain footage I guess that there's nothing stopping them from taking another company's work.Maybe someone will come along one day and really do these films justice"
2,"Okay, but not that great","A big part of this cd consists of Shanias life story, spoken by an australian woman. I have heard that story so many times that I'm pretty tired of it, so I didn't like that much. It also has a couple of short parts(a couple of minutes each) from Shania interviews from Australia, which is nice if you like Shania, but the interviews aren't that special. You also get a small book about Shania. It has her lifestory AGAIN and some pictures of her. Most of the pictures are from when she performed at FanFair for the first time and from different award ceremonies. I don't think that the pictures have been published before, but that's probably because they aren't very good. And there has been a lot of other pictures from these events that have been published, so I wouldn't buy this just for the pictures. Overall I think that this is okay if you're a big fan, but nothing to get that exited about"
4,antsy nursing student,This book is very well written. It has been one of my favorite textbooks so far. It is very informative and also user friendly. It made my maternity rotation a very enjoyable experience.
1,terrible,"We owned the previous version of this product and liked it very much. Unforatunately, after 17 months, the place where the power cord connects to the receiver broke, and we can only use battery power now. It seemed like a good idea to just get a new one, but I'm regretting that decision. This product is lightweight, the cord is flimsy, and most importantly, the sound quality is considerably worse than the previous version. I recommend trying another brand."
1,Static is all it gives you!!,"I just bought this monitor yesterday, and as soon as we plugged it in the staic just went wild! I thought ok maybe it was something going on last night but nope again it is all STATIC. It is very VERY ANNOYING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH WHEN YOU BUY A PRODUT YOU EXPECT IT TO WORK. I ACCEPT THAT THING'S HAVE PROBLEMS BUT THIS THING IS HORRIBLE! I AM SO DISAFATISFIED RIGHT NOW I HAD TO LET OTHER PARENT'S/CAREGIVERS KNOW HOW BAD THIS PRODUCT IS. Now dont get me wrong I buy nothnig but Fisher Pirce so I am not someone who just bought something from the company for the 1st time, and I have to say Bad move on Fisher price for marketing this because now I wont buy anything from them again. Just to be safe."
1,AWFUL!!,"I typically read these reviews and take them with a grain of salt. Everyone has their own opinions and quite often I have purchased things that had a low star rating and loved the product. However, this time around, all the negative reviews are right on!! This monitor was just AWFUL!! We picked it out for our registry cause it was affordable. But really, we connected it and brought one of the recievers downstairs and could not believe the awful static we could hear clear accross the living room and with the TV on!! This is not worth the money. We are getting ready to have our 2nd child and with my present 3 year old I have been using the same ol' Fisher Price monitor we got for his shower 3 years ago and it is still clear and static free!! Now I have to return this present monitor and look for another one that isn't louder than the sleeping child."
1,HORRIBLE!,"Do not buy this monitor! We were kept up all night by the extremely loud static while the baby was actually asleep. We purchased the digital Graco imonitor to replace the FP. It was expensive, but crystal clear - well worth the money!!!"
2,Stopped getting reception,"I got this at my baby shower almost a year ago. I loved it when I first started using it, but lately (almost 10 months later), it barely gets reception and is always staticky. I am now in the market for a new monitor. It was really good at the beginning but just didn't last."
2,Poor Quality...Bad Reception,This monitor is junk. Too much static and you have to turn the volume way up to hear anything in another room. Spend a few extra bucks and get something better.
5,Great Product!,"The monitors work great! The reception is VERY good. We have the base upstairs and the handheld downstairs and you can hear EVERYTHING upstairs, not in just the room we have it in. It works great because we have older children upstairs as well and we like to keep an ear out for when they are up! Great great product."
2,Don't buy it,This monitor has so much static - it's awful. I can also hear my neighbor's telephone conversations as well as another baby. The Graco monitors are much better.
1,Worked for 2 months,"Then stopped working. First one of the receivers stopped getting any sound, thought it was since we left it on all the time but then the other one did the same thing. Lights still work but are no use at all. Waste of money, will look for another one now."
1,IT IS IMPORTANT TO READ REVIEWS,I wish that I had read the reviews for this monitor prior to buying it. I bought this monitor because it had 2 receivers and was within my price range. When my children are sleeping (a 1 1/12 year old and a 2 month old) the monitor is keeping me awake with horribly loud static(can be heard several rooms away). The static is so loud it has even woken my 2 month old up on a number of occasions. I did not keep the box because it worked fine the first week or two so I am now stuck with it and have to buy a new one.
2,Not what I was expecting!!!,"Good points:- Can use AC adapter or batteries with receivers- Two receivers are very good: one for mom, another for dad.Bads:- Transmitter should have a sensitivity adjustment. All lights turns on with other sounds far away from my home...- You need a screwdriver to change batteries.- My receiver is still making static noise on either channels (A or B). The receiver is less than 8 meters away from the transmitter with only one wall between us. If I adjust the volume level to a minimum I can hear my son, I get also static noise so I can sleep!I was expecting something with perfect sound quality. You will take some days to adapt yourself with the transmitter sensitivity, with the receiver litte noises and to get confidence on it.I should have read all those reviews before buying it. Try looking another brand or model. Unfortunetely, I tested this product only after left USA, so I can't get my money back..."
1,Garbage,This monitor is garbage. It's been in use for less than 1 month and one of the monitors lost its sound. I would give it minus 5 stars. I purchased it because of the Fisher price name and reputation. I will no longer consider Fisher-Price products. I think that this product is so bad that Amazon should not be selling it. Since it failed more than 30 days after purchase the customer must absorb the loss.
1,DO NOT BUY,"I have NEVER written a review on Amazon, despite the fact that I will read reviews prior to making a purchase. To our suprise, we had our 3rd child 5 years after our 1st, so we needed to repurchase everything. Sadly, my wife bought this monitor (name brand - it must be good). However, it was terrible. I actually bought a new one (Graco - that is great) and tossed this one in the garbage...Save your money, buy another brand. I feel generous giving this 1 star, I would do negative stars or no stars if possible."
4,Kim chee Japanese style and other treasures,"This cookbook provides a number of ""instant pickled vegetable"" recipes as well as pickled ginger, garlic and other slower pickles. They range from highly salted to soy based to vinegar based to rice bran based - many we would consider simple marinated vegetables. Eggplant, burdock, cabbage, ginger, turnips, rape flower, garlic, plums, daikon, pineapple, kumquats, ... a wide variety of ingredients serve as the base for these pickles. The book shows step by step how to pickle and serve these foods in glorious style.As an added bonus for the adventuresome, several of these vegetable pickles can also substitute nicely for South Asian pickled vegetables. The ""Pickled Seven Vegetables"" can be used as a chutney or salsa. ""Asparagus in Mustard Soy Sauce"" and ""Grilled and Poached Peppers"" can serve as side dishes. In short, the usefulness of this cookbook is not limited to those with an interest in Japanese cooking."
2,mediocre,"I have tried many of the recipies from this book. I find they often do not turn out well even if the instructions are followed to the letter. Also, the instructions are short and often leave essential steps out. However, the section on rice bran pickles is very good and may make the book worth purchasing."
3,"Good detail, but not layed out well for younger students","My daughter needed a world atlas for 5th grade. This is a very detailed atlas, but it was not organized in a way that was easy for my daughter to do her homework, which was much more basic. For example, she needed to know the capital of Missouri. The page for the state of Missouri showed pretty much every single city in that state. The capital city had no indicator, and the text was smaller than other city names, to indicate the size of the city. I'd recommend this atlas for an older student, not elementary or middle school."
3,good atlas for the money,Our grandkids loved this atlas when I looked @ it with them but not a book for them to use on their own. The binding is not very good; I don't imagine it will last very long but a good reference book for a library
1,International Atlas,I was looking to replace my Rand McNally International Atlas which is 40 years old. The old atlas has 278 pages of detailed maps of the world. This atlas has only general maps that aren't really of much use. I'd love to replace my old atlas if I can find a new one with detailed maps.
5,Loved it!,"This DVD is much, much better then their previous DVD (Generation Lost). The old DVD was all talk and no music, except for 3 live performances at the end before the credits. It really was a ""get to know the band"" sort of DVD.Another Station, Another Mile is completely different. It is a series of short interviews and after each interview a live performance is shown. All of the good songs are here and some of the live performances are really, really good.I was worried at first because I was watching this on a 52"" tv and the initial footage wasn't very good (it's standard def, and meant for a smaller screen - even my up scaling blu-ray player couldn't make it pretty). The quality evened out though about a third of the way in and looked pretty good. The audio is very well done for a live event.Overall, I loved this video and the live performances included on it. I've watched it several times already and I've only had it since this weekend!"
1,Great Band - worst DVD!,"for the first time, sorry for my bad English :)Rise Against is a great Band but this DVD ist the Worst Case i could Imagine....Between every Song there a Documentation.The 2.0 Sound is very sad, there is no DVD Menu, Chapters for all 5min, then you cant go the the next Song, it starts in the middle of every Performance.Don't buy it."
5,A more cheerful compilation than the first volume,"Like the first volume in this series, this is a compilation of classic Spanish guitar music without additional instruments. The pieces on this volume are of a more upbeat character than those on Volume One. As with the first volume, the music is not to be missed. Note to the publishers: Volume Three would be a most welcome addition to this series."
1,Blatent Pro-Communist Propaganda,"This WWII era film is about the most fraudulent picture of Stalin's Russia to ever come out of Hollywood. When you consider the volume of negative information that has come out of the former Soviet Union, this picture is surrealistic in it's bucolic picture of Soviet life on the verge of WWII. In point of fact, the peasants in the Ukraine welcomed the German Army with flowers. They had been so brutalized by Stalin that they actually thought (for about five minutes) that they were being liberated. Then the Germans turned out to be as brutal as the Bolshevics. It is hard to believe that the Cold War began just three years after this film was made. If you see it or buy it, view it as a double feature with ""Enemy at the Gates"", a recently made film that is extremely close to the truth. No wonder McCarthy investigated Hollywood."
3,middel of the road,There is nothing great about this cd. Her Blue Alert album is a million time better then this. Maybe I'm just not getting it because the other reviewers seemed to have really enjoyed it. But I would give it a miss and get Blue Alert instead.
5,"Perfect size, good workout",The posters are a perfect size for home use. The excercises are great. The pictures are clear and easy to understand.
2,Need to be married with children..........,"Good if you are married with children I would guess. If you are a single adult woman with no kids, a lot of it doesn't really apply."
2,Lightweight Advice,"Well-meaning, I suppose, but very lightweight advice. Take a hot bath. Breathe deeply. Drink decaffinated tea. Please. Nothing new here. A nice little book for someone who's pretty oblivious to the world around them. Sorry to be jaded; but nothing here that would seriously stop the sweating! Maybe it would stop mild perspiration, but not real sweat!"
3,single gal on the go,"its a nice simple book for married socca moms. the advise was basic, the chaperts are too short to really explore the subject. however, i did learn something new and it helped reinforce what I already knew.its not profoundly insightful, but it is a gentle reminder to take a little step to become a better u every day. ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" by Spencer Johnson, gave me the eureka moment I was expecting to get from ""Dont Sweat the small stuff for women"". so you should try that book as well."
1,for wealthy women,"Good if you're happily married with lots of free time and can live the high life that this author evidently does. There isn't much to get out of this book. If you're familiar with her husband, Richard Carlson's other books you will know the information is all the same. Spend some quiet time to relax and meditate. That's about it!"
3,Pretty darn good,"I think it was pretty darn good, not tooot'n good, but prettydarn good. Lots of animals and senep t'now eem"
1,The online book review was very misleading.,"This book is not so much about ASP as it is about Visual Interdev. The book comes with a CD that contains a trial copy of Visual Interdev that drops dead after 90 days. Rather than teaching ASP, the author shows how to construct Active Server Pages using Visual Interdev. He does show and discuss screen shots of the ASP that is created. The screen shots however are displayed in a faint blue text that is hard to read. This could be a helpful book for anyone who intends to create Active Server Pages in Visual Interdev, everyone else would be better served by purchasing something like ""Beginning ASP Databases"" by John Kauffman."
2,Don't Do It!,"This was the first ASP book that I got, and it was pretty much a waste of money. It's not writting well and there's many pages with print screens showing you how to install things like InterDev............Does the author really think we cannot install software?????The reason I gave it 2 stars is there was a couple of times I was stuck on some VBS syntax and this book had what I needed."
2,CD-Rom problems,"Ooops, slight CD-Rom problem with this one. I was unable to install it. On their web-site, Prima-Tech state that ""some file seem to have disappeared at the duplicator's"". They offer a ZIP-file to correct the problem, to be downloaded at one's convenience. Well, make sure you've got plenty of time - it's 27 Megs....."
4,Good Beginning Book,"This is a solid beginning ASP book. If you have only marginal knowledge about how to program, this book will help you. It also explains the code and VBScript very well. It is a good first book on ASP and VBScript."
2,He's a cat!,"I think the birds, squirrels, fish, etc. are cute. Unfortunately they do not keep my cat's attention long enough for the scenes to loop."
1,Bad copy of video,The video keeps freezing up in spots. Bad quality DVD. Would not recommend buying this because of this issue. Going to buy the cat sitter dvd to replace this one.
5,Purrfect DVD for cats is Perfect!,I have tried other DVDs meant to entertain cats. This one is the first one that they loved!! I got it for 1 of my cats that was interested in TV - and by the time it was over I had 2 cats fascinated by the screen. They have watched it several times and enjoy it each time. Especially the bugs!!
2,not what i was expecting,"I ordered this item hoping that it would occupy the attention of my cats at least temporarily. Sadly, my cats expressed around 5 minutes of interest in the packaging for this DVD, which they batted around and bit a few times, and absolutely no interest in the DVD itself.I gave this product a 2 star rating not because of it's appeal to my cats but, because it does have a certain zen like quality that I enjoy listening to when reading.Please note that the opinion I express here is relative only to my experiences. Clearly there are a lot of people here who have had a lot of positive experience with this product and if you should choose to order it, I hope your cats love it."
1,cat uninterested after 60 seconds,Sound track is bogus - doesn't match images and loops over and over. Cat looked at the tape for a minute or so and then went on his way.
4,Great video clips-- soundtrack is awful,"I have 2 cats... my female tabby doesn't seem to notice or care, but my male tabby can't get enough of this. Mice, roaches, birds, squirrels, etc. It has everything he wants. It's long, and has a looping option, so it can keep their attention all day long. The soundtrack is the same though, the same bird chirping over and over and over again, throughout the bird scenes, throughout the roach scenes, throughout the mice scenes. Because of that, it loses a star (I was going to give it 3... but thought I'd be generous).But it does keep him entertained."
2,"Disappointed in ""SOUNDS"" of animals","The DVD was a great idea, however, the ""Images and sounds of mice, birds, bugs and fish"" stated in the ad is not true. The entire looping track of all the animals is the same annoying bird chirp throughout. No sounds of mice, bugs, or fish anywhere. You end up muting the DVD while it's playing and the cats got tired of the short repeated scenes within 1/2 hour."
1,Chirping Birds Will Drive You Crazy,"Exxon was interested in this video for about 10 minutes, batted at things on the screen. Texaco watched from the sofa looking totally bored. I do not know why there had to be chirping birds throughout the entire video. Roaches with birds chirping, mice with birds chirping, fish with birds chirping...my best advice to you is to watch this with the sound turned off! This video is being donated to Furkids for their yard sale - maybe someone else's cat will enjoy it."
4,Cat love it,I don't play this all the time when we leave but once a week or so I loop it for a little company for our two year old cat who misses us when we are gone for the evening.
4,The BEST one out there!!,"Hello! I can't believe it, but it's TRUE! Your CAT(s) will watch! I am a believer. I can't stop laughing. I think it's just as entertaining to watch your cat as it is for them to watch this DVD. Thanks again!! I hope there is a VOL 2 out there!!"
3,Nice video,"My cats look at this but then they nap, I don't know if they find it annoying or not. They go outside. They are six cats and have a lot of daily entertainment outside of videos. Some of the stuff on it I find annoying. My cats are primarily interested in hunting. We have a kitty home entertainment center outside, its a tree with three bird feeders on it. They would like more videos with stalking and killing prey. Wild cats hunting and devouring flesh. Thats what kitties want to see not feather toys on screen."
3,Chirping Bird Throughout,"The video pictures are great with lots of variety, but the sound of a chirping bird goes on throughout the video even for the video of fish in an aquarium or mice. It distracts from the viewing of this DVD. My cat usually loves these things, but seems a little annoyed with this one.There is the option of playing a musical soundtrack instead of the bird chirp throughout."
2,"""Not the greatest DVD""","I bought this DVD along with 2 others, and this one I hardly ever put on for my cats. They feature birds, squirrel, and other animals, but there is no real sound from them. Then there is an option if you want to play soothing music along with it. But then it is still missing the nature sounds. The sounds don't match the real sounds the animals are making at the time. Seems fake, and it is all repeats of itself."
5,Cat Video,"I have an 18 mo old Bengal and he LOVES this video!! He is happy to spend 30-60 mins per day watching it and trying to ""catch"" the birds and cockroaches! I would highly recommend this video to any cat that needs lots of stimulation."
4,Keep your cat entertained,"Our cat loves this DVD. The sound track is repetitious but this doesn't seem to bother her. There is a great variety of ""prey"" shot at her eye level. If I lost mine, I would buy it again."
5,The Purrfect DVD - Cat Entertainment Video,"The Purrfect DVD - Cat Entertainment Video is really the ""purrfect"" video for your cat. I have three different videos and so far this has the best entertainment. The other videos have to much footage of cats while this one has everything that my cats seek by watching out their window. The loop feature adds to the fact I can leave it on while away and the cats can choose to leave and come back to their hearts desire. My Casper loves to sit on top of the TV and try to find the squirrels or pidgeons that he thinks are at the back of the set when they leave the screen. This deserves a 5 star and my cuddles can't wait for the sequel to hit the stores!!"
4,Cats like it,"I turned this on for one of my cats and he didn't seem interested in the birds, but as soon as the mice came on he was very interested. He jumped up on the table where the tv as and was trying to find the mice. He's even gone up there looking for them when the video isn't on."
3,"Not too bad, just keep your expectations low",If you keep your expectations low you can find this movie entertaining. It sure is a simple movie with a touch of delicious European sillyness. It is simple but it gets the job done better than most of the expensive big budget American movies.
2,Not eventful enough,The whole story is about a plot to seduce a married man and woman. I found it to be minimally entertaining. The cinematography was poor in my opinion.
2,poor quality,"I have several of these throughout my house and love the look but they are terribly made. This one in particular, the 3-way 600-watt push button dimmer, I've had break on me three times! It's expensive to begin with but once you toss in replacing it three times and paying for an electrician to install it becomes prohibitive. I'm on my last one before I switch to Lutrons, which never seem to break. The part that breaks for me is the push button which just stops operating (maybe a spring breaks?). Though I do have one 300-watt where the dimmer part broke and the on/off still works. Very disappointing. And yes, they're all the same manufacturer -- you can tell if you look closely and see the ""CA"" for Classic Accents on these switches pretty much anywhere they're sold."
1,Not as good as Return of the Funk Soul Sisters,"I bought this because I love love LOVE Return of the Funk Soul Sisters. What a mistake.Whereas the Return of the Funk Soul Sisters is full of upbeat, fast tempo FUNK FUNK FUNKY grooves, this is full of slow, soul-less yawners and horrid disco.There are two good tracks, no great tracks and the rest is forgettable garbage."
2,"Promising start, beginner's ending","A quick scan of the review indicates that there are two main camps here - those who find the ending edgy and those who see it as vandalism, as pointless as painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa. I have to agree with the vandalism people. If the author had foreshadowed it, I would not have cared for the effect, but it would have been acceptable. However, sprung jack-in-the-box-like as it was, one can only wonder what the author's point was.""Life is senseless, so books can be, too""?""Junkies are junkies and no matter how much they seem to have changed, they are really still cold, self-centered jerks and shame on you for being fooled by them""?""It's my book, I owe the reader nothing, and I can do what I want""?I really don't know nor do I, at this point, care. And it's too bad, too, because the author has the potential."
4,"Overall, an exciting new author","If you are serious about fantasy, this is a good book. If you are serious about happy endings, this is a bad book.Adam Stemple has a wonderfully readable and likable voice as an author. He hooked me from page 1 and I didn't want to put the book down. That is why the ending is so devastating. Was it a lack of maturity on his part? Was it a desire to startle the reader? Was it an intentional statement trying to separate his identity from that of his mother (Jane Yolen)?The only way I'll ever know is if he writes the sequel that this story is screaming for."
4,I am going to read this again!,"I'm not a big reader of fantasy so when I say this book is unique, perhaps it's more just unique to me. I read Singer of Souls several years ago but it is one of those books that sticks with you. Besides unique the story is haunting and lately it was haunting me to read again. I don't read books more than once often. But of course I couldn't remember the title or author. After about an hour of searching google with terms the combo of busking, faeries and festival found the book and now that I found it I'm going to go read it again. I also noticed that a sequel has come out since Steward of Songs- BONUS!"
2,A good story deteriorates into a splatter film,"Adam Stemple has the makings of a good writer. He has a fertile imagination and a quirky sense of humor. His descriptions of people, places and events have a feeling of authenticity. At times he's capable of working some real magic with language. However, like many fledgling writers, he has trouble distinuishing the voices of his muse and his inner demons. As the story progresses, the demons get the upper hand, and a novel that begins as a charming mystery degenerates into a neausating bloodletting. Mr. Stemple seems to have chosen the worst possible ending for this unfortunate book, resolving all conflict with an ugly adolescent power fantasy.Adam, you can do better than this. Don't let your demons write the ending of your next book. Let them have their say, then put their pages through the shredder and give your muse some breathing room."
2,not a work of good scholarship,"Being that this was written by a PHD, I was expecting thoughtful and well-reasoned arguments to respond to. However, this pamphlet appears to simply re-iterate much of the common stock arguments proposed by most critics. There is nothing new to address here which has not already been answered elsewhere [...]. Furthermore, this pamphlet is without references or footnotes, so it does not give the impression of a scholarly work. Instead, the author tends to provide extended monologues on his own opinions and insights--in the end without proving much of anything."
5,Great Little Book,"This is a wonderful book. I like this title and ""Now I Know the Ten Commandments."" It's a great teaching aid!"
4,The Beginner's Bible by Karyn Henley,The Beginner's Bible by Karyn Henley is a very nice book with great illustrations. Made a great gift for my grandson.
4,Son loves,"Son loves, so I rated a four. Took one star off, because I found some of my favorite stories were missing, or I didn't particularly like the way they were modified for the kids.... but regardless of my opinion, my son enjoys."
5,Great Depth for teaching the Bible to early readers!,"Have read a few of these stories and am very excited at the depth of the details reported! The pictures and the cohesiveness of the stories keep our 4 year old daughter attentive as we read to her story after story. The newer addition of this text got more cut out, a little disappointing: if you have a choice, get this one."
5,Simple to-the- point truth kids love!,"I bought this book after several attempts to get my children interested in the Bible. I always look for metaphysical interpretations for children, but am not sure they exist. And I have bought a handful of children's Bible literature so when I read a review for this book I thought, great! When the book arrived my heart fell. I told myself, ""another flop!"" and was ready to send it back. But my little boy (8) saw it and asked me to read it. And he just loves it!! He asks for more, always more... even though he has tons of other books on his shelves. And I am thrilled. The stories are very simply put and illustrated, exactly like a child needs. Sometimes I shudder at the interpretations (at times a bit too classical for me), but an adult can always explain the stories. This book has an amazing calming effect on kids, and it seems to fill a need they have. Amazing! I think it is a perfect first approach to the Bible."
4,Wonderful ..,My daughter is three years old and looks forward to reading a bible story at bedtime. The illustrations help guide the story along and are quite colorful. It is recommended.
3,The Beginner's Bible,Got the orders as described with one of the Bible. The other Bible was ripped and it should have said acceptable and not Good.
1,Bible review,"I was very disappointed with the condition of this book. It was advertised as ""used"", which should mean that it was obviously handled, possibly dog eared, etc. However, this book was scribbled in and dirty. I think that it's a reasonable expectation for a used book to be in decent shape, otherwise it shouldn't be resold."
1,Deus Ex Machina,"This book, as well as the more adult bible, relies on a trite deus ex machina ending so predictable that it could've been spawned by the toadiest of hollywood writers. Children should read books of substance, not fantastical pablum meant to brainwash them.Excellent illustrations."
5,Great for 3 year-old,"My daughter feels very important as she takes her Bible to church, just like her Mom and Dad. The illustrations are perfect for toddlers--lots to look at, which leads to questions, which leads to discussion...it's not so much the text that teaches them, but the discussions the book prompts that gives me the openings to talk about God with my daughter."
2,Obscure Story,"I didn't like this book very much. Nor did I feel any sympathy for the protagonists. An artificial alien presence, an unclear and indefinite purpose, a contrived plot. That novel seems to have been hastily written indeed."
2,Stay away!,How the hell did this tie with Dune for the best novel of 1966. If you want to read Zelazny read Lord of Light or the Amber series.
4,I perfer this to Dune,"I always thought Dune was somewhat overated. It's one of the great landmarks of the genre, but it has its flaws. Zelazny's novel is written in a sardonic, but not too cynical voice, is filled with action, and the characters are, in my arbitary opinion, more interesting. Zelazny was one of the great stylist of the genre, Herbert wasn't. Mind you Dune's plot was more complex. Read Dune, but don't let this great work pass you by either."
3,Without Prometheus Unbound,"Without having read Prometheus Unbound or knowing as much Greek mythology as Zelazny, this book largely flew over my head.Often miracles would happen to get the characters out of trouble (on at least two occasions I remember off the top of my head). To make matters worse, a lot of the dialog is like machine guns firing, where one person says a single word, the other character replies with one word, and then the first person says another single word. Dialog will go on for pages without any dialog tags. Besides the protagonist, the characters are largely superficial. The love story was not impressive by any means.The only thing I found somewhat satisfying was when I learned what the Vegan's really wanted.So, if you are a master of greek mythology, I heartily recommend this book. Or, if you want to learn more, pick it up. Otherwise, the book probably isn't for you."
1,"Jilton, not Stilton","I ordered a ""6# wedge"" as a special treat for my aged parents who were to host a big holiday party. Package arrived nicely but wedge weighed just over 4lbs, making this the most expensive cheese I've ever purchased. I've yet to taste it and I'm sure it is good (?) but someone's scale is broken... and I'm feeling ripped off."
5,Best book I have read about getting to know your children,It has lots of ideas on how to communicate to your children and how to have fun with your kids while raising them at the same time
5,"Amazing Book, you will need no other!","I have many many books on parenting, but this one is a treasure. It's an easy read, easy layout, and it REALLY AND TRULY gives you 1001 ways to ""connect with your kids"". The list is from 1-1001, but each chapter is a separate category. If you have little or no time to read, then this is the book of all books. Buy it, read it, give copies away as gifts. I think the ideas and suggestions in this book could change the world! Honestly."
3,Classic Doo Wop,"In their trademark headgear, This teenage quartet from Philadelphia hit the R&B charts in 1955 with their hit ""When You Dance"" from which the term ""Doo Wop"" was coined, as they use the phrase in the background vocals of this song. This was followed up by ""Sister Sookey"" but failed to make the charts. Nevertheless this CD has their hit and is worthy of exploring the Doo Wop genre."
5,Nice charm,"This World Trade Center charm is what I was looking for. It is a nice piece, big enough to be noticed on a bracelet, nicely detailed."
1,Don't buy it,"Unless you want your kid to have problems going to sleep at night and to have to explain that Wishbone isn't really dead, skip this one. This scared the hell out of my seven year old."
4,Entertaining,"It wasn't as scary as it was engaging. Being an hour long, the movie has a plot that is expectedly more involved than its 30-minute version. All in all, it succeeds at what it sets out to do (be a 1-hour version of a Wishbone episode) and should be seen by any serious fan."
1,The Book,"I could not believe my eyes when I opened this book up and found pen writingon almost every page. Furthermore, the spine was broken. Yet the company thatI purchased it from said it was gently used. This company should not be doing buisnesson Amazon. Do not trust them or purchase from them. I purchased another book fromthem at the same time and it was almost as bad!"
2,A little ackward,"I really feel like the odd one out, but I wasn't too impressed with this book. Sure, the illustrations are gorgeous...By no means am I knocking Ms. Brett's skill here, but I just find the text a little long winded and ackward. Maybe it's the way I'm reading it...? It just doesn't seem too terribly well-written to me."
5,Gingerbread Baby,"I really enjoyed this story. It was neat how it was a gingerbread baby instead of the gingerbread man. This little boy named Matti is making a gingerbread man with his mom. The instructions say not to peak into the oven while it is cooking. Matti starts getting excited and he looks into the oven only halfway through its cooking. A little gingerbread baby pops out and says, ""I am the Gingerbread Baby, Fresh from the pan. If you want me, Catch me if you can."" After that it runs around the whole village saying that phrase and running away from everyone and everything that tries to catch it. It is running free until Matti makes a gingerbread house for it to live in. I think this story would be very easily likable for children to listen to and read."
4,"Half-baked, or half more fun?","The Gingerbread Man never grows, or bakes, up in this rendition thanks to an impatient little boy. The illustration of the gingerbread baby tying the two girls braids together is rather comical.The gingerbread being isn't eaten by anything this time, but takes up residence in a gingerbread house in the boy's yard. This end is odder than the logical original one where the gingerbread man is eaten. Is it the case that a cookie being eaten by a fox is now considered too grotesque?;) Maybe instead of playhouses, kids will be asking for cookie houses for their pet cookies from now on."
5,The Gingerbread Baby by Jan Brett,"Jan Brett has done it again with her latest book. Her detailed, distinctive style is immediately recognizable to those who admire her work. The Gingerbread Baby is a new twist on an old tale. The naughty baby runs away with a host of people and animals chasing him. The pattern of the story makes it a joy for children to read and act out. Jan adds her own special ending which will be a delight to children and adults alike."
5,This is a super story with excellent pictures!,We thought this story was very funny. We really liked when the gingerbread baby was running away from all the people. We also thought making a gingerbread house for the baby was a great idea. The pictures were very colorful and neat to look at. In our opinion this is a perfect book! We recommend it to everyone!
4,"A very good ""Chillout"" CD","Its hard to put the finger on what exactly to classify ""An Endless Journey, Vol 3."" Even though its pretty much pure chillout or lounge or downtempo, whatever your term for relaxed electronica, it has a little bit of Ambient, Drum and Bass, and Acid Jazz all thrown in. I had purchased this off Amazon awhile ago, and it only cost me a buck. I see its price has gone up, but if you can find it for a dollar or two, its a great investment. Nine Bucks for this? Maybe, its good, but not top of the line electronica, so invest wisely. ENJOY"
3,Good book on fasting,Good book on learning to do a fast. A little pricey for a book that should be called a pamphlet. That is the only reason i am giving it 3 stars.
2,Not the Vinal Version,"The title is misleading. It's not the CD version of the original vinal recording. Although some of the tracks are ""passable"", I wouldn't recommend the CD."
1,I want my money back,"This book was a waste of money and will be donated to the Goodwill soon. The book is unorganized, jumps all over the place, repeats its self too much, spends way too much time on how things look today, is written in a way that is uninteresting and confusing and the computer graphics are horrible! When I say horrible I mean they are an embarrassment to the publisher. It's sad when the old Prehistoric books from the 60's and 70's put the new stuff to shame. What ever happened books illustrated with real paint rather than is computer looking plastic crap laid down upon present day scenery rather than how things actually looked 10,000 years ago?"
3,Graphic SF Reader,The end of the Tomb of Dracula series is contained in this volume. There are other things like Dracula magazines and other bits and pieces put in to fill it out.Note that it has been discovered that the excellent original artwork has been altered and censored in some cases. That sort of prudishness in very disappointing in something that was always aimed at adults.
4,Noel Ensemble 1,"its a great CD of xmas tunes and other songs, most in french, a few sung in english, but for the romantic at heart or those who love french accents, its flawless.....a great cd for the holidays!"
2,Gotta be something better out there,"Ran across this one while digging around for wedding music. Too bad the quality of these recording suck. I'm may know very little about classical guitar technique and recording, but this is junky. Keep looking."
3,"A decent book, but a little *too* concise","This is a good book for linguistics majors, especially if you intend to go to grad school. The book has definitions of just about every word I've needed to look up, but sometimes the definitions aren't very clear and are worded in the same difficult jargon that makes you need to look these words up in the first place. Longer definitions would be helpful. But in cases where words learned in class need clarifying, it does offer another explanation. Overall, it's worth the price, but I'll be on the lookout for other linguistics dictionaries that have clearer explanations."
3,Not as avertised,"The listing said ""3 new 1/2"" deep throat gluing pipe clamp"", but there was only one in the box. Still a decent price for the one, but definately thought I was getting 3. Boo!"
4,A Vincent Price Film Feast,"Do you like stories of the macabre? Enjoy reading Edgar Allen Poe while a storm vents its fury outside your window? Like watching Vincent Price do what he does best?If you answered yes to any of these, you'll want to own this trio of tales based on the works of EAP.Price is a 'priceless' actor when it comes to films of gothic horror. Somehow, he can dramatise horror and revultion as no other can -- truly he is a master of the macabre.The film itself consists of three spooky tales which will enthral the watcher (assuming this is your sort of chosen entertainment). There is virtually no bloodletting in these tales, but they strike a deeper note than Freddy ever has.Not for younger children unless you want to sit up with them all night for their dreams, mature audiences should find this trilogy great for an evenings diversion.** Recommended **"
5,An entertainly gruesome threesome!,"The way in which several Poe stories are combined into one in this DVD's feature, ""The Black Cat"", is worth the price of admission alone. But when you have these three terrific actors - Price, Rathbone and Lorre - together, you can double the DVD's value.The film transfer itself is superb - in great shape, with a crystal-clear picture and crisp sound. The sets are quite picturesque (after seeing how Price really HAS let the housekeeper have too many days off in ""Morella"", I don't feel so bad about not vaccuming my own home - and it's amazing how the wine in the glasses on the dining rable is still red after all those years!) Lastly, ""M. Valdemar"" should teach any hypotist-wannabe that messing with any afterlife states is, at the very least, VERY unwise!A great DVD for any fan of horror and these three great actors in particular!"
2,Tales of Terror,"Only reason to watch is Peter Lorre and Vincent Price, I am disappointed it wasn't scary. It is more Over-Dramatic and theatrical(like some of Vincent's Stuff)than being something of a ""Terror""."
2,The nadir of Corman's shining collection,"Peter Lorre's ,""The Black Cat"",is charmingly done.Yet,the other two are stinkers.I'm a Corman fan,but this was boring and silly to watch.I think they had a good idea ,bringing the trilogy it to the big screen.But,this version and interpretation of Poe's masterpieces didn't translate well at all.So ,beware of the dog!"
5,Some books stay with you for a lifetime,"It's been years since I read ""Kabloona"" by gontran de poncins. I don't remember the specifics of the book (I'm going to read it again, soon). What I do remember is the lingering humanity of the people. The hard life they lived. The culture shock between my life and theirs. I remember the mirror they held before me, forcing me to question our idea of ""progress,"" ""civility,"" and ""modern man"". Books such as ""Kabloona"" and ""Black Elk Speaks"" by John G. Neihardt and ""Mutant Message"" by Marlo Morgan tells us more about our roots as a species than many of the great thinkers and philosphers who speak in the abstract and grandeur of modern man. You read a book like this and you must pause and reflect, look deeper into yourself and the rushing stream you were born into. Step back and look at life from a different perspective. It can be life-altering or at the very least a stunning revelation."
5,Left on the ice,"I read this book many, many years ago and have forgotten many of the details. I remember one, however. When the old one couldn't travel, they put her out on the ice and drove off. That is so relevant to our contemporary society and the discussions of social security and the elderly, caring for the disabled, etc. We can't leave the disadvantaged on the ice and drive off but must find some way to care for them."
5,Wonderful resource for collector or academic,"I still use this book when writing a formal analysis of a decorative arts piece. It focuses on really looking at a piece and how it works as a whole. The only weakness I found was that he seemed to struggle with discussing folk art. A wonderful resource and and easy, quick read. The author also has access to a wonderful collection which helps in making points and providing examples."
2,"Good, but not enough per the title.",Readers are led to assume that this book will deliver more information than it does.
3,Latino Pop,"I've heard a few Lorenzo Antonio songs on the radio, and was hoping to get a taste of this sound on this CD. Unfortunately, I think I might've gone too far back in this singer's music career to get that result.I personally did not enjoy the CD as much as I'd hoped. I tend to like his Ballads and rachera songs. On this CD, there are a lot of ""bubble gum"" type songs in it. The singer's voice sounds very young and child-like, it really surprised me. I think I liked 2 songs on the whole album, and they are ballads."
1,Worst Cream DVD Ever,"This is nothing more than a cut and paste job from previous DVD releases. There's nothing new, and the only interviewee worth a dime is song writer/poet Pete Brown, who doesn't actually interview that well at all. The rest are just insignificant nobodies like record producers, journalists and modern musicians who happen to 'like' Cream, but have no connection to them whatsoever, apart from living on the same planet! The old footage is available on previously released DVDs, and the new footage is not worth watching. No new Clapton, Baker or Bruce interviews - not even old ones for that sake, it's just nobodies and stock footage."
2,Shallow,"This is shorter than I would expect a feature film to be. I didn't realize it was animinated, although that may be my bad. Content wise, it's a bit shallow and too ""accommodating."" Nothing in this about the true meaning of CHRISTmas."
2,Yuck.,"Possibly if I had never seen the live version ""Eloise at Christmastime"" I would have given animated ""Eloise, Little Miss Christmas"" a better rating, but unfortunately it just doesn't hold a candle to the live version.."
5,Little Miss Christmas,Little Miss Christmas: My Wife loved this TV Movie and she was Very Happy to get It on DVD. She
1,Not made for American feet,"Had to return these...they are nice looking shoes and a great buy BUT you cannot get your feet into them!!! They, like many shoes today, are NOT made for the average American foot! If your feet are incredibly narrow, try these!"
3,Some good tracks are missing.,"""features all their British A and B sides""?What about the British top 20 ""hello how are you""? The Cd misses some of the Easybeats best songs such as the brilliant should-have-been-a-single ""Sorry"" and such songs as ""she's so fine"" and ""wedding ring"".This collection has some good tracks,like ""heaven and hell"",but I would recommend the 2 cd Easybeats Anthology over this."
2,"Good review of examples, but few original ideas","If you follow the web and the industry closely, this book is NOT for you. Does a good job of reporting on existing industry players (as of 1999) but presents few original ideas, and in 2000, looks a bit dated (perhaps another testimonial of how fast this industry is moving?) If you have NOT been following the developments and strategies on the web, this might provide a good primer, but clearly should be a beginnning of your research, not the end."
4,great introduction to the web economy,"This was the first book I read about the lessons learned in the web economy. I read it in one sitting and learned a great deal. The author provides many real world examples about what worked and what didn't. However, bear in mind that the rules are still being written and rewritten as we speak. Also, there wasn't really much in the ""digital darwinism"" of the title, catchy as it sounds."
4,good advice for marketing your wares on the web,"This book is an excellent reference tool. Not only does the author use good case studies to make his point, he also provides a list of websites to study for your own information. (He also did this in his first book). Although a lot of the suggestions are based on common sense, the author also provides a lot of current information, i.e. viral marketing. Definitely a good starting point for anyone interested in learning about (and the some of the terminology for) e-commerce."
2,An Unnecessary Live Album by the Great Nana Caymmi,"It is a live performance which covers all her hits.But recording quality is not good.Production seems to have not cared as much as it should.I am a big fan of Nana Caymmi's albums.So, unfortunately, I tell you: - Forget it!All her repertoire is better recorded in their originals.All sung in Portuguese."
2,Nice book but...,I spend a lot of time in NH so I was particulary interested about learning about covered bridges. Since getting this book I've seen several other and perhaps better and more interesting books on the same subject of covered bridges that had many more photos and more indepth detail. This book is very very thin and seems more like someones college thesis than a fully published work. This is an okay book for the money but you might want to check out some others first before making a decision if you are interested in this subject.
4,It Covers Bridges,This paper back was very well done and has a lot of interesting info and photos.I would have like to have seen color picutre;s but other then that its a good book.
3,"Good Product, but Broken","I really like this product, but when I dropped my phone it shattered. Not the products faul, only mine. Just wish it hadn't broken. The shipper was great and they got it to me qucikly."
1,Both I bought broke quickly-about a month or so,"Thes just didnt hold up well enough to be worth buying. Seemed to get caught on anything near my belt & thrown off to the ground, often breaking a chunk off the holster."
4,Nice Holster for the money!,"Good holster, not too cheap and has lasted for a month so far which is better than the first holster I got off Amazon. This is not as good as the Cellet but for the price is an all around good value."
1,Northing more than a pamphlet,This book was a HUGE disappointment. It looked like something someone with little experience made on their computer. The picures are black and white drawings and there is very little information. A complete waste of money!
1,NOT WHAT I ORDERED,I SPECIFICALLY ASK FOR BRONZE AND WAS SENT COPPER. I DO NOT LIKE COPPER OR I WOULD HAVE ORDERED COPPER. WILL NEVER TRY YOUR COMPANY AGAIN
5,Sonicare has met it's match!,"I bought this toothbrush because it was a gold box savings and needed to replace my other Oral B. I am so happy with it. My teeth feel ""squeaky clean"" after using it and it doesn't ""tickle"" my gums like Sonicare did. It has a great battery life and two different speeds. After a few weeks, my teeth look whiter and I had a lot less plaque at my last dental appointment. My husband is a dentist and has started to use a more deluxe, but similar, version of this (has a digital timer, 4 speeds, and some other aesthetic nuances) and is also very pleased. In fact, he likes it so much that he is starting to give them away to his new patients!"
4,Nice toothbrush,Got this a few weeks back when it was on sale. I can't compare it to other power toothbrushes as this is the first one I've owned. My dentist recommended the phillips brand but I chose this one over the price. I love it. If you are currently brushing your teeth with a normal toothbrush I would highly recommend upgrading to this one. It's amazing how clean it makes your teeth feel. I was skeptical at first - I just thought my dentist was trying to give me something I did not need. I was wrong I'm glad I bought this one.It is easy to use and kind of tickles at first when using it but after about 3 or 4 times using it there is not weird feelings at all.
2,Batteries are not replaceable,Good toothbrush but the batteries are not replaceable so you need to replace the whole unit when they won't hold a charge anymore
1,IM NOT SATISFIED,"Well, for me it's a bad experience with this item. In my case, it woks fine only 3 months, after that this have an erratic perfomance. At this mommnet i take a decisition: dont use it anymore."
5,Be sure to order right replacement brushes,Web site often suggest what other people bought at same time. The replacement brush heads suggested do not fit the Oral B S-200. Be sure you order right brushes.
5,She Loves It!,I bought this as a 2nd toothbrush for my girlfriend who visits on the weekends. She normally uses the one that rotates by Oral B. After using this sonic TB she wants to take it home and leave the old one at my house. I highly recommend this TB. Had it since October '09 and have had no problems with it. Only lacks the travel case which you can easily rig one up but that would have been a nice accessory.
4,"Great Cleaning, a bit noisy","We owned an older model Braun power brush but it wasn't sonic. This is smaller and ligher--takes up way less counter space. The cleaning is wonderful and makes your mouth feel fresh and wonderful. It does however, make quite a 'singing' noise while using. My son actually LOVES how it sounds and wants his own...I think for some kids it would be a great way for them to brush-- you can open/close your mouth to change the pitch! Great price as well, it has come down in recent years. A pleasure to use."
4,Very effective but not very durable,"I bought two of these Oral-B toothbrush units in mid-December 2009, one for me and one for my husband. They are very effective, leaving the teeth looking and feeling clean. Problem: The units don't last long. Mine died after seven months, after a normal level of use. You can't get into the unit to see if the battery contacts need readjusting or something--if anything inside goes wrong, you're looking at purchasing a new unit. Like I just did, not having found a more durable alternative on the market. (The quality of the Sonicares I formerly used declined to the point where a unit typically lasted only a month or two.)"
5,"Small price, Big smile!","This was highly rated by Consumer Reports, Amazon.com had the best price by far, so my pearly whites are happy and so am I!"
4,Really Like the Clean Feeling!,"I bought this product about a month ago and have really liked it so far. I really feel that my mouth feels cleaner after I brush with this toothbrush. It has also helped me brush longer and more thuroughly. It gives you a warning every 30 seconds, telling you when to switch sides of your mouth. While I don't always use this, it has helped me to brush for a full two minutes.Each charge last for a long time as well. I actually can't remember the last time I charged my toothbrush. I would say once every couple weeks, and I brush multiple times a day.The only con I have noticed is that the tooth brush head is alittle small, but the vibration and cleaning power of the toothbrush makes this less noticeable.I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone looking for a better toothbrush that wants a cleaner mouth and whiter teeth."
4,Great way to brush your teeth,"I am glad I made the purchase, my teeth feel so much cleaner and I am brushing longer as well."
1,VeryProblematic,"This monitor interferes with our cordless phones on all channels - a shrill noise emits when the phone rings or when you talk on it. ALso, it beeps out of range even when at distances much less than the stated 800 feet (- from our daughter's bedroom to the kitchen). I would definitely not recommend this product, and had I not lost the receipt, I would have returned it!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,I bought this monitor because I thought it would be good for our 2 story home...WRONG! The receivers had lots of static from the beginning. By the time my daughter was 3 1/2 months old we had thrown away one of the receivers because it didn't work anymore and the other receiver had even more static from when we bought it. I wish I would have taken it back.
2,Is it on or off?,"I bought this monitor b/c i wanted dual receivers and it advertised a long range. The instructions inside said 400ft range however the box boasts a 900 ft range. Confusing? I can tell you that the signal is fuzzy when I'm in my driveway...directly under the baby's room! Also the battery is terrible. I can charge the battery for 8-10, use it the next day turning it on only during the baby's nap and the battery is dead by the end of the day. Finally, there is no power indicator light. You have no idea, in the dark of night or from across the room whether or not the receiver is on. I will be returning this monitor."
1,Horrible,"This monitor has been nothing but trouble for us. The battery life is terrible. It can charge all day, and by 5am, it is beeping from low battery already! The beeping is so scary the first few times you hear it! My daughter has been sleeping 9 hours since she was 2 1/2 weeks old, and the monitor's battery didn't last as long as she did. I had to get up and change the monitor to the other one that was charging. Ridiculous!Now we are having problems getting them to turn on. My daughter is only 11 weeks old, so the monitors are fairly new. We have to turn them on and off about 15-20 times before they will turn on. If you are shopping around for monitors, I would suggest a different one. Good luck!"
1,Horrible - buying a new monitor after only a 2 yrs of use,"This the first review I've ever written and I'm only doing it to save somebody else some money. This has got to be the worst monitor ever. I've used it for less than 2 years and it is just horrible. Horrible reception, horrible battery life, and now I can't even get sound from it unless I wiggle the plug into it. One of the receivers is taped up and I still only get sound every once & a while. I have to buy a new baby monitor. Very disappointed. Would have given it negative stars if I could have."
1,Not a quality product...,"I've experience similar problems mentioned in other reviews. The monitors work well at first. After a few months, both monitors won't hold a charge so we had to plug them in from room to room. After 6 months, one monitor stopped working, and today, just over a year old, the second monitor died."
1,HappyMom,"This monitor is simply awful! We have suffered with this piece of junk for way too long (6 mo.). Hence, here I am on Amazon to purchase it's replacement. There is constant static. If someone walks in front of the monitor, including our cat, the static noise soars. We have tried several locations throughout our home, turning it every direction...you name it. To no avail the static is always present. It only changes from loud to louder. My husband is an engineer and very gifted with problem solving but unfortunately, this is beyond his fixing. Save your money and frustration, buy something other than this monitor."
2,Great Monitor for Three Months,"This monitor was an excellent monitor for three months. We were able to use it on all three levels of our home and was so sensitive we could hear our son breathing! However, the charge on the receivers faded until they didn't even last through the night without being plugged in. Then the channel display on the main console died and the system does not work at all. An expensive investment for three months. If you decide to get this I would definitely buy the service agreement, although you still lose money on shipping the broken product to them and the price of the plan."
1,No good after 3 months,"This monitor worked well for us, but only for 3 months. I thought the reception was great and we never had much trouble with static or interference. We would leave the recievers plugged into the charger though and the rechargable batteries have crapped out on us after only 3 months of use. I'd be hesitant to buy this product again. If you do get it, don't let the recievers sit around plugged into the charger!"
3,"Maybe a great product, but deceptive advertising","The sound quality on this is really nice... TO MY SCANNER! I got this used from a garage sale, and since I wanted to ensure that there is no interference to our other baby monitor. I used my ham radio (which receives signals from 500 kHz to 1 Ghz, and was quickly able to find these on 902 Mhz with channel spacing by about 0.25 Mhz. The signal is plain wide FM which can be picked up on any scanner. The ""private"" signal is not encrypted at all.While I don't think that should stop anyone from purchasing these, don't assume that your neighbors can't pick up the scanner. Buyer beware."
1,Don't Buy,"We can't get these to work without constant static. They have never worked. We did everything the ""Problems & Solutions"" recommended but they still never worked."
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT,I don't think this product even deserves one star. During the 3 months that it lasted would not work all the time. I had to keep the hand held piece plugged into wall or it would not work properly. Defeats the purpose of it being portable. I was not able to take it outside while we were in our pool while my newborn napped...which was main reason we bought a baby monitor.
1,Waste of money,"I have bought 3 sets of these and they are all a waste of time. They last a short period of time so within a few months to a year you would need to get another one; Initially I bought 2 sets one for home and one for grand parents who baby sit at times; the one at home spoilt really quickly as it was in use a mot more; then when I was looking for a replacement it was the only type available quickly in the stores here so I bought the third set,(which was a newer model) eventually all were useless and my kid is only 2 1/2 now. The only benefit is that it picks up all the sound in the room really clearly but there is a lot of static and interference from other objects especially mobile phones."
2,Worked great...for about 14 months....,"We loved this monitor for our 4th son at first. It was very clear, we had no static and we could use the two portable receivers wherever we were. Now that he's 15months old, the receivers only work when plugged in. Apparently we kept it plugged in too long and you are supposed to only charge them for 13 hours. We like to be able to use the portable device when needed and don't want to have to remember to unplug them. A bummer we will have to purchase a new monitor for baby #5!"
2,"Snap, Crackle, Pop","We bought this baby monitor to hear our toddler daughter call us in the night if she needed us. We had an old Safety that we used for 5 years but as it aged, it became more static-y. My husband wanted one that had a privacy feature so I picked this up. He immediately commented that the 900MHZ frequency really wouldn't give us privacy but would try it out.This baby monitor worked for a few weeks but then the receiver would start to ""pop"" loud static sounds. First it started around 4am in the morning but then progressed into all hours of the night randomly. My husband thought maybe it was picking up wireless or X10 signals... Whatever the reason, these receivers are useless to use at night and will have to be used only during day use for my younger child's naps."
4,Great except for the belt clip,"I'm active. In and out of the house, up and down stairs. This thing keeps falling off my waste. The belt clip is worthless. Other then this it's awesome and we do keep it plugged in at all times."
4,monitors,"given to ungrateful person, was not expensive enough or high end of product, so I never heard back, they stated, well I guess we will just use them until they break."
3,SHORT battery life,"The only reason I gave this 3 stars is I liked how sensitive it was (I could hear my baby breath) and I didn't experience static very often. HOWEVER, from the get go the handsets never heald a charge more than 3-4 hours without being recharged. Within 3-4 months they held no charge at all. Now, 2 years later yes, they are still working sort of. It's hit or miss if it's actually going to turn on and stay on even when on the plug. I assume there is something funky going on with the on/off dial. I beleive we paid around 60-70.00 and I expected better longevity. I would be hard pressed to suggest one of my friends buy this or give this as a gift."
5,Very clear sound,This product was brought for my friend who gave birth to twins. The sound comes cross very clearly. She loves it. I think it is a wonderful product for baby or elderly adult that needs care. Or maybe just use as inter-comm. I recommend it.
5,Baby Monitor,Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!Ten channels - so little interference from other devices. Very sensitive microphone. Comes with it's own rechargeable batteries.
4,great product!!,This is the second Fisher-price monitor I have had. This model is the upgrade from my old one. It is a great price for a good product. The connections are very clear and having it rechargable is wonderful!
5,duel monitors,"I have seen many of the baby monitors on the market,but for the price you get two belt clip moitors,and the reception is very good. You can't beat it."
2,read if you plan on using the AC adapter!,"Monitor itself works fine -- but not if you plan on using the AC adapter.....Fisher Price customer service recommends that the AC adapter should not be plugged into the reciever for more than 13 hours at a time or the rechargeable battery and/or unit will be damaged. In my mind that makes the product useless if you intend on using the AC adapter -- you'll have to remember to unplug it every morning or risk wrecking the thing! (the fisher price rep actually told me I'd ""fry it"")."
4,Great for us!,"This monitor has been great for us. We have been using it for over 10 months, and the only complaint I have is sometimes there is a little static, but even then we can hear our son stirring, and often we can even hear him breathing! I love that we know he's up before he starts screaming. These are also very small and light, and very portable. We throw them in the diaper bag and take them with us so we can move about or go outside while he's napping. The two receivers are great to keep one in our bedroom and one in the living area. We're very happy with this choice!"
1,Irratic out of the box,"Maybe we got a lemon, but out of the box this monitor acted irratic. The primary concern is with the base. When it displays the channel, it's working. But sometimes we have to unplug it for quite some time to get the base to work. And when the base doesn't work, the receivers sound like a weather alarm. Not fun at 3 am. I checked Fisher Price web page and it didn't mention a problem exactly like ours.We are going to return it for another brand."
1,Avoid this product if you don't want it breaking,"This product is not recommended unless you don't mind it breaking every 12 months.I've owned two now that start off working pretty well. After about 8 months, things start to no longer function:- Adjusting the volume button results in speak not working. You must jiggle it to make it work- Static/noise appearing in the signal when nothing else has changed (e.g. receiver and monitor are in the same location with the same channel)- Random spikes in the volume of the receiverOverall, its not a good product and fisher price should be ashamed to have their name attached to it. If this cost $[...] i may consider buying it."
3,Good sound for the year that it worked,We have had this set for a little over a year and in our first smaller house it worked great for us. Once we moved we noticed that the reception got worse. Then one day one of the receivers stopped working. I switched batteries and it didn't make a difference so it died. A few months later the base station decided to stop working. This isn't the most expensive set but I was hoping that I could at least get a couple of years of use out of it.
5,The Best Monitor I have owned,"I love this monitor! No static, does not interfere with my cordless phones...its great! I keep the radio on in my twins room and I can STILL hear them if they cry.Worth the purchase!"
1,Why can't I give this a NO star review?,"We picked these monitors based on the largely positive reviews. They are horrible. One of the receivers has never worked properly (the lights all stay on all the time) and Fisher Price has never responded to my request for a replacement.There is so much static on these monitors that it wakes my wife up at night. You can have the monitor sitting on the table and, for no apparent reason, it just goes to a loud static for several minutes. We have tried all the channels with the same result. It doesn't matter if we are in the living room which is 15 feet from the baby's room or in our master bedroom which is across the house, the things are still full of static.I would give these monitors 0 stars if I could, but I have to give 1 to allow me to write a review. I highly recommend you select different monitors."
2,Didn't work for us,We didn't like hearing the constant white noise it makes when on. It's too loud. We ended up going with Sony's baby call monitor and LOVE it. It has voice activation. So you only hear the monitor when baby is making noise.
1,Loud noise,This monitor worked ok at first but it has increasingly gotten louder and louder in terms of static. It started out that it had to sit in a few certain places around the house and it would be ok but now nowhere we sit it is it ok! My mom got one too for when she baby sits and one of her receivers completely stopped working and the one that does is doing the same thing. I would not recommend this if you want to use them longer than 1 year. My son is 14 months and I am getting a new one.
2,Would not recommend,"The receivers are good; sound quality is good, and I like how the receivers and rechargable and last for about eight hours or so without a charge. However, I have owned this product for about 7 months and the monitor base isn't working so well. It doesn't want to turn on. I don't think it will make through the year. It's hard to find something that actually lasts."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"We got this baby monitor as a gift for our baby shower for our first child. From the specs, it looked to have promise but all in all it was a bit disappointing. Now, at 17 months after we started using it, the unit is dead. Therefore, to celebrate its death, here are some pros and cons:Pros:1. Two receivers are very handy. We used one upstairs and one downstairs.2. Range is decent and goes through walls.3. Picks up sound well, at max volume, when the baby cries, you know it.Cons:1. Well, it only lasted 17 months. I would have liked to use it for our second child?2. Staticky. Even though pro #3 is good, general sound quality is not great, so when the baby isn't crying, replace loud static.3. Battery Life. Rechargable batteries are great but after a while they learned to stay alive for only 3-4 hours which meant plugging it in everywhere we went or wait for the annoying BEEPing sound when it started to run out of batteries."
2,Not worth the money,"This monitor has bugged me after 6 months of use. Lots of static, random buzzing & now it just plain wont work! It did well showing the light gage of noises in my daughters room. When Im trying to sleep & the monitor is randomly buzzing its down right annoying. there shouldnt be a problem like the buzzing since my house is 1000sq ft & all other electronics in the house arent interfering. The battery life is really short so we had to keep it plugged in all the time. I figured buying an item over $50 it would be a solid piece of equipment but its junk to me & disapointing. Keep your receipt!"
5,Four Years Plus,"After seeing some other reviews of this monitor, I'm going to guess that we lucked out, or that these are hit and miss. As I posted in a comment to one reviewer, we've been using this monitor for over four years and only now are we looking to replace one of the batteries (looks like we'll have to put our trust in an unknown-to-me battery super-store website for that).It's been a great product for us. We've taken the base and two receivers on several vacations, plus used them daily at home. A typical day has been to take a receiver off its charger when our (son, and then daughter) goes to bed, and put the other receiver on the charger. Then swap them the next day, and so on.Of the many gifts we received from the baby shower for our first, this is among the ones that has gotten the most use. We've been very happy with it."
2,Doesnt work for longer than a year,"I've had this product for a little over a year and I would have said it worked great and I loved it. Except, it recently burnt out and now all I hear is static. Apparently its not supposed to be plugged in all the time, EVEN IF ITS OFF. Well I dont have time to plug the darn thing on and off everyday. So I have to go get a new monitor now!!"
2,Bad monitor,"I owned this monitor for about 20 months. When disconnected form the power cord, the receiver shows almost no charge and beeps to be recharged. Basically, the batteries fail. The receivers only work when connected to the outlet. I gave 1 star because it worked for at least a year, and the second star because I like the 10 channel selection. Other than that, I do not recommend buying this item."
1,Monitors stop working after a few days,"We bought one of these - and the monitor stopped working after a few days. We thought, ah, a lemon, let's return and get a new one.Got a new one - same thing, after about a week the monitor stopped working."
1,Awful monitor,"I purchased this monitor about a year and a half ago and within the first couple of months one of the dual monitors just stopped working. Aside from that, the monitor itself is very loud and fuzzy at ALL times and no matter what channel it is on, it frequently makes a beeping sound. Now just a year and a half after using it..the other monitor has stopped working. This monitor is such poor quality. Do not waste your money on this monitor, let alone any fisher price monitor."
1,poor reception,"Tried to use these monitors for the last 2-3 weeks. They have horrible reception. With the monitor in the next bedroom, the monitor has difficulty picking up reception on all the channels. Then when it dosen't pick up reception for 5-10 seconds, it starts beeping. We don't need another reason to wake up in the middle of the night. Stay away from these monitors."
2,Continuous breakage,"After 2 months, our base unit quit working, so we bought a new full set, giving us 1 base unit and 4 parent units. Then, over the next few months, some of the parent units stopped working as well until we were back down to 2 parent units. Now, 2 years later, the last 2 parents units are starting to break as well, and will just turn themselves off in the middle of the night. I definitely don't recommend these monitors!"
2,Didn't stay on!,"Unfortunately these did not stay on for more than a day. Even tried adding a coat of nail hardener over top but didn't work, and if they came loose and you peeled off the rest seemed to take a layer of your nail with it! Went back to a bandaid."
3,nail repair,"It helped some for a couple of days, but then didn't prevent nail from splitting further."
5,great product!,Was exactly what i needed! great product! I was looking everywhere for this product and was so glad to of found it on amazon. Probably will buy this exactly product from here again soon!
4,kids. love. it,a good. add on for. your. love. ones and a neet. collectors. box for. them or. as. a gift in good taste.
4,Retelling of a Persian/Sufi tale,"The Red Lion is Diana Wolkstein's retelling of an ancient Persian tale, likely a Sufi teaching tale. The illustrations are in a Persian style that well suits the text.The King dies; before he can ascend the throne, the prince must fight a lion. Because he is afraid of lions, he flees. He enjoys the hospitality of a shepherd until he realizes that he might face lions. He enjoys the hospitality of a desert group until he realizes that he might face lions. He enjoys the hospitality of a city - where he finds his bride - only to be faced with lions. Realizing that there is no choice, he returns hope to face the lion - a friendly lion unless one fears him.The story is told by a master storyteller who has the sense to trust the story; there is no overtly didactic language."
4,Schnozzola Durante J.,Darn good reading. Loved the British type. Chapters were full and interesting starting and finishing each thoroughly. Never knew all that about the roaring 20's. Photo's worth staring at.
4,Independent Muscle,"I think the album is nice. I respect anyone who strives to meet their goals and accomplish dreams. Many people talk a good game but NEVER follow through. Many people criticize but (""what are you doing?"") Don & Fruit are cool, down to earth people and I hope that someone out there hears them and gives them a shot. They have the potential to be bigger than any other hip-hop artist. Go and pick up the cd it will make you think and dance!"
4,Don & Fruit Something for everyone,"Don & Fruit "" How We Go"" has something for everyone. The title song is lyrically superior to the ""H0-HUM"" associated with the Hip-Hop culture. This release may be the first ""Alternative Rap"" CD ever. Songs such as ""Loving U"" and "" I Tried"" are breakthroughs in the reality of love and life as seen through the eyes of someone living in todays world. ""Basement Booty"" and ""Do Dat Dance"" are club gems. I only wish this release could be heard by the entire nation. ""How We Go"" is definitely worth the buy, I can't wait for the full Lp to be released. The recording industry may have found the next Superstars because Don & Fruit can cross all barriers and their music can be classified and marketed as more than just Hip-Hop. Great Release!! Ronald B"
4,Awsome comic,"For Gundam Wing fans, this comic is like a larger version of the first Gundam Wing manga. The pictures are much larger and so is the text. It's the first time you can truly say that your reading a Japanese comic book!POSSIBLE SPOILER**For those who know the Gundam wing series, this book runs from the begging of the series to the point where Heero Yuy tells Relena Darlian (Peacecraft) that he will kill her on the St. Gabriel School balcony (after she hand him the invitation to her birthday.)END SPOILER**The book does leaves out several scenes from the anime series, but you can still grab the overall idea."
1,128 pages that felt like 500.,"I read many glowing reviews of this novella in sources I implicitly trusted; Amazon.Com's review section included. The gap between promise and fulfillment has never been so large in my reading experience. The central character, who unfortunately is also the narrarator, is a whining, mawkish, hyper-sensitive narcissist who should have reflected and learned from his wife's criticisms, instead of ruminating about leaving her. Consequently, I've lost an evening from my life reading this trite missive."
2,False,"Narrated in first person we only get to Know one character, that of the husband that is going to flee from home, but what he tells us of his wife seem completly stupid. After 7 years of union that's all he knows? No wonder he wants to live. Anyhow, what Kureishi tells us about this man is also insufficient, plane. Stands at one only level. There are no characters at all, just one unique sensibility that flaws over the book splitting us. A waste of time."
4,Great Mind Probe,"This book is a wonderful exploration of the male mind, as that mind weighs the pros and cons of staying with one woman. The book is well-written, with ocassional lapses into triteness, but overall, a very good read. Ladies, don't do what I did and hope to find ""answers"" here -- the book is really just a trip through the miasma of indecision and conflict that plague every man (hell, every person!)."
2,Less than blown away,"I loved Kureishi's ""Buddha of Suburbia"" and enjoyed ""the Black Album"" but ""Intimacy"" failed to leave any lasting impression on this reader. Other readers praise the book as offering some great insight into the male psyche, yet, as a male I found it hard to relate to the novel's self-indulgent narrator. I want to state, for the record, that not all men feel they'd drown their wives and children for the sake of great sex. ""Intimacy"" is however a somewhat compelling book and Kureishi is definitely a wordsmith. Read ""Buddha"" way before you go for ""Intimacy""."
4,An entertaining read,"INTIMACY is a very fun book about the agonies of a man who can't quite bring himself to leave, though he's persuaded himself this is exactly what he wants. Not a terribly deep book but a good, light read with brains."
1,Trite.,"I found this book to be appalingly shallow and, taken as a whole, rather dull. There is no thought-provoking content introduced here; just the sad, silly ramblings of a typical self-absorbed post-modernist urban male trying to recapture the youthful zeal of a past rememberd but never lived. Not only did I fail to sympathize with the narrator, I did not care what he was saying or why.I did not have a problem with the novel's content - infidelity has been the topic of novels, films and plays too numerous to mention, many of which I've enjoyed. The successful ones broach the subject with a clear eye or fresh voice (or both), and shed light on what is generally overlooked or ignored. INTIMACY does none of those things."
5,Really fascinating and compelling,"I almost felt like this book was a memoir rather than a novel, so fully did the author draw me into the world of the protagonist. Although I know that this recital of marital woe is not the viewpoint of all men, it seems typical of several men I have known who have chosen to end relationships, and it seems to me to be a comment on the question of whether a traditional marriage can square with the appetites and desires created within modern Western society."
4,"a little painful around the edges, but worth reading.","My copy has a yellow cover - do americans perceive colours differently? This seems to fit so well into his new london play 'why i sleep with women' and his short story in the last issue of Granta ('London'), that i wonder (again: paul theroux at work here) whether this isnt entirely non-fiction.Great read - Kureishi comes out on top again, and women, if you really want to know what goes through mens minds at the end of a relationship, here is your chance. Men, if you want to know how it will feel, dont say no one told you...."
5,"good quality, decent price",I've had this set for about a month so far haven't noticed any problems. The only small suggestion I could make to the manufacturer is to design a better TV stand(TV only turns sideways). I live in Brooklyn and the floors aren't exactly even so it would be nice to have the option to tilt the screet a little bit up or down.
3,"The idea is good, but .........","The idea of the mat is a great one. However we have been unable to make the mat stay in place (contact cement didn't work. Now we are trying Liquid Nails); when we slowly drive onto the mat, it slides forward, thus defeating its purpose."
3,Buy a laser instead,"I don't have one of these but I have a overhead laser light that shines down on my car when I pull in. I can be a couple feet to the right or left and it still works. Or I can park at the exact same spot by lining it up as I drive in. Much easier and more flexible then this would be. I picked up one for under $15. Search ""Garage Laser Park"" in Amazon."
2,Slippery slope,I purchased the set of two Park Smart parking mats as a simple alternative to hanging a tennis ball on a string which would hit the windshield when my car was sufficiently inside the garage to close the door. But even with stickum on the bottom the mats slipped on the smooth floor of the garage and the car hit the workbench time and again. I may say the service I got through amazon.com was first rate; it's the product I found wanting.
2,Kinda Scary,I bought two of these - and they:1) don't stay in place2) it is hard for me to line up and drive directly over them3) the bump are pretty substantial to drive over (feels like I ran over an animal)Reasons why it doesn't work for me:1) drive a small front wheel drive car2) Wheels are small3) concrete floors are smooth and dustyoveral i feel like these either don't work or i am just using them wrong..
4,NORWEGIAN FAILED 2 OUTDO LAMARR,"This was the reamke of a French original. Goldwyn wanted his Garbo(SIGRID GURIE) to do it... Sigrid later said that they all pitied Hedy Lamarr because she was thought to be a common girl after her nude footage in the film Exctasy 1933. MGM`s Mayer indeed was not sure of Lamarr was good enough for the MGM family and borrowed her to Walter Wanger.As it turned out; Lamarr became a sensation, Gurie NOT! However, Lamarr did many a film but only the 1949 SAMSON AND DALILAH was an equal hit a`la ALGIERS.ALGIERS had a poor print on video, but even on DVD the print is much 2 muddy. It is a shame, because it has an authentic feel... Indeed - when producing CASABLANCA, they hoped they coild achieve something like ALGIERS. However, faith was not kind and CASABLANCA is the eternal classic. If u want 2 c Sigrid do a good performance, check out THREE FACES WEST with John Wayne and THE ADVENTURES OF MARCO POLO with Gary Cooper."
3,Bad Print,"Hedy, Charles and supporting cast are all terrific. The horrible quality of the physical film is very distracting and annoying. This is definitely one film that the Academy of Film Preservation needs to clean up -- probably in a hurry."
4,Algiers DVD,I am very satisfied with the quality of the item and the shipping time.Thank you. I will not hesitate to order again.Fred
4,Algiers,"A good friend of mine was unique in the fact that he was a very close confidant of Miss Hedy Lamarr prior to her death in January of this year. His recounted stories and timely messages from her sparked an interest for me in the golden-era actress.Algiers is one the finest films featuring Miss Lamarr I have seen. In a day when special effects could not be relied upon to keep an audience interested, this film fills the ""void"" nicely. With a mixure of romance, murder, infidelity and seduction it is a great watch on a lazy afternoon."
3,For all the fans of Charles BOYER !,"This movie is a remake of a French classic ""Pépé le Moko"" with the great Jean GABIN. ALGIERS is not as good as the original one, but I really liked Charles BOYER in it. For me, he is an underrated actor, and was not just a ""latin lover"" (He was a ""smart lover with white gloves"" and an ""Aristocrat of passion""). This movie is entertaining but not a must-have. Hedy LAMARR really disappointed me in her first hollywoodian role (Sigrid GURIE is better but less beautiful). Women, if you love BOYER, see ""HOLD BACK THE DAWN"", ""MADAME DE..."" or ""CLUNY BROWN""."
1,Buy the other DVD version!,"After reading the EXTREMELY bad reviews here of this DVD copy, I bought the other version (ASIN: B0002CR4GY) for sale here on Amazon.The other version has none of the quality problems reported here. Don't be fooled into thinking this is a better version just because the photo on this DVD case is in color and the other in black & white. See my review on the other version for more information.BUY THE OTHER DVD VERSION THAT AMAZON SELLS!!!"
1,5-star film;1-star quality!,"Boy, that other reviewer was right about the lousy production quality of this movie. It's such a marvelous film. Charles Boyer does a fantastic job as the master criminal who possesses panache, intelligence, and a desperate need to escape the casbah that is both refuge and prison. Hedy Lamarr is luminous. Such a classic movie deserves restoration, and those of us who love good movies enough to purchase DVDs deserve better than this. Okay, I'm used to the faded, grainy, jumpy aspect of the typical AlphaVideo DVD, and am willing to put up with it just to have this film. But the sudden intrusion of another movie's dialogue -- including a man screaming -- right in the middle of the story line is inexcusable. I nearly came out of my chair in startlement. At times you can barely hear Pepe le Moko's dialogue for this other, loud overdub. If this is the only copy of this film you can find, it's still worth having, but be prepared for a really stupid production mistake."
4,A wonderfull series....!!!!!,Although this is not my favorite silverblades book and Danielle Panati is not my favourite silverblades mamber I have to say this book had its moments.At some points it drifted away from scating.... but on a whole it is a very pleasant read ... i cant wait to read the rest of the series... I would safely recommend it for anyone who loves scating :-)
2,Worst binding on any book I have ever seen,"The book cover came off within one minute of opening the book. By the time I had finished reading it,it was in multiple sections,it does not qualify as a book."
5,Reading and re-reading for forty years and still wonderful!,I first found this book when I was fifteen and have read it now at least fifty times. The characters and events still bring tears of laughter to my eyes. I've wished for a very long time that this could be made into a movie so more people could share Thorne Smith's vision. It is an intelligent read and a wonderful look at urban life in the late 20's. Block out some time and prepare to laugh out loud.
2,Animated divorce,"This movie is primarily about how a 6th grade girl is affected when her parents decide to divorce. So it's much more serious than Kiki's Delivery Service and Totoro. It's hard to find the subject entertaining, but the movie does have lighter moments as well, and it is well made."
5,Great Resource,"I had never heard of Celiac Disease when my blood test came back positive. Between receiving the blood test results and having a biopsy to confirm the disease, I purchased and watched these DVDS. They are clear and thorough and were just what I needed to help understand the disease, the diagnosis process (blood test, biopsy, etc.), long term effects, and what the diagnosis means. They are not fancy (i.e. no special effects, dramatizations, etc.) but a great resource that I highly recommend to anyone who would like to learn more about Celiac Disease."
5,Cabaret-Goth,"Gitane is an excellent artist with incomparable range. She's done goth, she's done glam, she's done punk.This release is an excellent live collection from when she was doing jazz cabaret in Europe and includes her own renditions of popular tunes from the classic era of jazz and blues."
3,Perfect for the average rider-not so for the professional,"I've been intrigued with this machine for some time now, and because I live in Florida whwere riding is severely limited in the summer, I decided to get one to give me a ""leg up"" so to speak when I return to distance riding this Fall. When you train three times a week fpr 15 miles at a time, this machine is not even close. I think that if it had stirrups, and was adjustable as far as heighth goes, it could be an improvement. The ""core building"" of riding is actually posting, or standing up in your stirrups as your horse trots along. The IGallop was like riding a lazy horse to me, at every speed. I will say that if you are a casual rider, or a novice rider, this will help with your balance. As far as the rest of us-not so much."
2,I Gallop,The product met all specs. We wanted something that worked the abs better than this. It worked the thighs and glutes well though. We returned the product to purchase an upgraded model.
3,igallop,"This is a compact, tidy device. It comes in one piece with no assembly! That is a plus. After 15 minutes I am ready to get off. It does feel like it helps a bit with core muscles. I don't think there is much other exercise benefit. I feel like I am accomplishing something if I am watching TV or just sitting and talking.Ideally there would be even more vigorous settings."
3,How do you fix a lame igallop ?,"Unfortunately, like Wendy my igallop also went 'lame' just after the year's warranty expired. It started flopping about, with a smell of burning plastic and the motor sounded strained. As I had paid 249.00 I can't really justify buying a new one again so soon. Is there any way of fixing it ie does it need a new microchip or .... Would appreciate any advice please."
2,OSIM igallop,"This iem arrive broken, sender communicated once, then push the resolution to her shipper who was quite unhelpful and rude, and now I'm still waiting for UPS to pay the claim. All in all I'm not very satisfied."
1,Would love to review this but ....,"I'd love to review this item but it arrived broken. Plugged it in, worked all of two seconds and died. After a very long hold time, finally got a cust serv rep who issued a call tag and said they'd send a replacement. They picked up the broken unit about a month ago - still no replacement. To be fair to Brookstone I haven't had time to call and complain, but I was told a replacement would ship without anything else needed on my part. Still waiting...."
5,nice tone,"I received the I-Gallop and was pleasantly surprised! Keeping your balance while seated on the machine is a workout in itself. I find that my posture has improved and I could actually feel the muscles in my legs working. Not as much fun as riding of course, but a nice easy way to firm yourself up."
3,Downer,"This is a pretty dark and disturbing movie. It is basically one man's descent into paranoid madness and how he brings a woman into his crazy world. This movie based on a strange stage play often times comes across as a play. Most of the movie takes place in the woman's hotel room. The actors are good with the parts. Harry Connick is very creepy as the sleazy ex-con. His best bad guy role since Copycat. I was really hoping for a big twist at the end to make the hour and a half of watching two people go crazy worth the view. Sadly it didn't happen and I feel a bit cheated. It is a well made film with good acting, it just left me a bit cold."
4,Creepy and scary,"Scary not in the sense it is a horror movie - what happens is horrific, but it happens in the mind of Ashley Judd's character. She does a great job of showing her character's decent from being an enabler to a complete psychosis. Michael Shannon proves yet again he is an actor of unflinching talent, here one can see a parallel with his character in Take Shelter. Watching it, here and there I wondered if there is anything to their delusion - how many steps are there between these characters and, say, people in conspiracy shows, i.e., anybody who gets killed off in shows like The X-Files? That is the scary part of this movie. Though I do wish the characters' decent was explored in more details - there are obvious jumps in the story, mostly due to the fact it was based on a stage play. Other than that, a good movie to raise questions about what we think we know - about others, but more importantly, about ourselves."
5,"A bit of everything, and well worth the time","We ""rent"" at least 1 video a week from Amazon, sometimes 5. Bug is a thriller and a cliff hanger. The movie has been around awhile, but i'd never heard about it. The acting was GREAT, and the parts difficult to master. There was deep thought and a realization at the end that what is real & what is within the real. Worth your time, and it is reasonably priced."
2,BED Bug,"While the ending was a mind trip, this movie is completely dull. It is misrepresented as a horror movie, which isn't true at all. Besides that, it takes over an hour for anything interesting to happen, and even the ""interesting"" bits are dull. Overall I'd say this movie was one to sleep through, and you should spend your money on something else.And if you like this movie, more power to you. I just can't sit that long while nothing happens."
2,Bug,"""Bug"" was marketed as a horror movie, but is really a strange mix of drama and psychological thriller. Agnes white (Ashley Judd) lives in a motel where she gets phone calls from someone who never says anything, presumably her abusive ex-boyfriend Jerry. She meets Peter (Michael Shannon). Jerry (Harry Connick Jr) stops buy for a visit and beats her up. Agnes and Peter get increasingly afraid of the bugs that supposedly infests the motel room and that may be part of some government cover up.The actors are all doing a great job. Ashley Judd's performance is Oscar worthy. Agnes and Peter's descent into insanity could have been very interesting but it feels more like a play than a movie, and on more than one occasion, it crosses the line from dramatic to over the top, almost laughable. The movie is weird, but not in a good way, and ultimately doesn't work either as a drama nor as a horror movie."
2,Bug,"This movie really bugged me (pun intended). It follows the relationship of a paranoid schizophrenic and a woman at a run down motel. For whatever reason she seems to like this guy even though he's quirky and convinced the US Army placed bugs in his system. He cuts himself, pulls his own teeth out and generally freaks out in every scene trying to reconcile himself to the bugs living inside him.Eventually he convinces his girlfriend that she too has bugs inside her. By the end of the movie they have decorated their motel room in tin foil so the bugs cannot transmit signals to each other.I can't help but think this movie was a waste of time and money and the acting really isn't all that remarkable, either."
1,One of the worst movies ever made.,"Bug? I waited for what seemed an eternity to actually see a bug and all I got was excruciating agony and continuous shots of man-butt.I watched it all the way through, pressed the ""open"" button on my remote, removed the DVD and thru it into the garbage.Do the world a favor, do not encourage hollywood to make any more films like this. Do not pay one penny for this movie. Destroy any copies you find."
1,IT BUGGED ME TO CONTINUE TO WACTH,"THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE! IT WAS LIKE A CHEAP RETARDED PORN MOVIE, WITH A SIDE ORDER OF (WHERE'S THE HORROR MOVIE)! THIS MOVIE SUX!"
1,Awful.,"This movie starts off okay, but descends into awfulness quickly. My favorite part was in the first five minutes of the movie, when Ashley Judd tries to open a bottle of wine with her teeth. Please don't watch this movie. There are 0 bugs in this movie, just in case you were wondering. This movie doesn't even qualify for the ""so bad it's good"" category. If you want to watch an interesting psychological thriller with good acting, go watch the original Sleuth. Or Twelve Angry Men. Or Point Break."
1,BUG = Ripoff!,"Man, after reading some of the reviews here, I was really looking forward to enjoying this. But after suffering through the whole film, all I can say is, IT REALLY SUCKED! All these bozos that wrote good reviews here only write that tripe to make themselves feel intelligent. It's like looking at a turd and saying, ""hmmm, but the color is quite interesting and the fragrance is unique..."". A turd is a turd, and BUG...is a turd."
1,"Wow, just wow.","Spoilers, not that there's anything to spoil.I'm a huge fan of psychological thrillers but this was terrible. The movie starts off extremely slow. It was about thirty minutes of introducing characters and their issues. Then you finally start developing a plot of bugs, little made up bugs. This random guy that is staying in a motel room with the main character starts flipping out, later to find out he's mental and they set themselves on fire and die. The writing, dialogue and acting is god awful. It was a interesting idea for an movie but was executed horribly."
2,Skip it,"The first half of the movie was very interesting and I kept waiting for the horror to start. Then when it ""happens"", I kept waiting for the movie to end. The actors are good, but when the first bug enters the movie you should turn it off."
2,SENSELESS AND OVERWROUGHT,"Only the career defining performance from a dynamic Ashley Judd mskes this movie worthwhile. Director William Friedkin's translation of the play by Tracy Lettis tries to instill suspense by fueling the paranoia of Judd and co-star Michael Shannon (in a very good performance). If you were expecting a true horror movie, you will certainly be disappointed. I had a hard time seeing Judd's descent into the paranoid woman -- her involvement with Shannon is deep but to fall so hard into the maelstrom of Shannon's dementia isn't grounded. Harry Connick Jr. is pretty good too as Judd's abusive ex-husband, but overall I was disappointed."
1,A waste of Time,This movie was very stupid. I rented it and my husband I really felt like we wasted our time. Do not rent it or buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Worst Movie Ever,"The movie has about 5 actors and two sets. It's almost completely dialog and runs in chronological order, so it's like a play and can get boring because of the sameness. Connick gives a great performance as a convincing bad guy (as he always does. If you want a bad guy, choose him), but the rest of the cast is lackluster. Not necessarily because of lack of talent. I think it's more due to the poor writing and direction.The plot is about a lonely, needy woman who latches on to a stranger who says he's being hunted by the Army. He was part of a Tuskeegee Institute type experiment where bugs were implanted in him and they are spreading. The movie strains credulity. Since it relies on believability for entertainment value, it has none. As a mental health worker, I hate seeing psychosis done badly, so my opinion may not be in the majority."
1,"Shame, Shame Ashley Judd!","Owe my GOD if you like to get high with ACID rent it! Otherwise don't waist you time with this stupid movie it sucked, sucked, sucked, sucked, sucked, sucked, sucked, sucked, sucked, sucked, sucked, sucked, sucked, and one more time SUCKED!!! Shame, Shame Ashley Judd I hope you got your money to a charity..."
2,Strong performances can't save this film,"I have a theory... If you can think up a conspiracy, it probably already exist in some form. Bug pushes that to the extreme in detailing the popular conspiracies of the modern world. Bildebergs, Tuskegee, Tim McVeigh, Gulf War Syndrome, AIDS etc.It is a psycho-drama that just gradually fades into a mental health tragedy that is more of a downer than a lesson in life. Great performances by Ashley Judd and Harry Conic Jr. can't save this depressing movie.1 *"
2,This is not a horror movie.......,"This is not a horror movie, there are no creatures or monsters just thestuff that goes in someone head. what a waste of my money.Might be enjoyed by the viewers that like these type of movies."
3,real diffrent,"the first half hour to me was slow but then the last 1hr 10 mins was weird strange, creappy spychological, part reminde me of th exorcist the way the guy acted all about buggs suppsoedlyt aking over his body, and it plaid mind games and kreepy to me I felt like this could of been som old hitchcock film or something could of passed as a black and whtie classic to me"
2,Actually good at first but not in the end,It started out good but then became monotonous and boring. I get it he's crazy and she is weak minded enough to follow him great!
2,Not what I expected,"From the DVD jacket, I expected a standard horror film about bugs killing people. Instead, I got a movie about mental illness. The main problem I have with this film is that there is no one to root for. All the characters are unappealing. Remembering Ashley Judd in such films as ""Double Jeopardy"" just makes the whole thing worse. Yes, she played against type here and did a good job of it, but her acting did not make me like her character. Ditto for the other people in the film. This one was a waste of the $4 rental fee."
1,Disappointing!!,"I just got done watching this movie - a HORRIBLE disappointment. If you are expecting a ""monster movie"" filled with actual bugs, don't bother. This movie was a complete misrepresentation of a horror flick. It was more a psycho thriller (a bad one at that). By half way through, I was praying it would be over soon.I was impressed, however, by how well Ashley Judd created her ""white trash"" character. I am a huge fan of hers, but this movie doesn't even make the list for me."
2,Just a bad bad movie,"Although when this was over all I could say was, stupid, stupid, stupid, the acting wasn't too terrible. It always saddens me when I see terrific acting with a really bad storyline. It's been a while since I have seen it, but what happens to all of the talent in the world? It just reminds me that when a person has enough money, they can do anything they want to with it."
1,Worst. Movie. Ever.,"I am a fan of Ashley Judd, but this was just horrible. I watched, kept hoping it would get better, until the end when I finally realized I had wasted 90 minutes of my life. Don't waste your money."
1,don't bother,one of the worst movies I've ever seen...long wait for something to happen and it baerly does.....stay away from bug!
1,Not good.,My husband and I tried to watch this movie...but found ourselves pressing the fast forward buttom multiple times. It really got boring.
1,"three words ""what the f@#$""",i agree with the other reviews that the movie tried to make you believe that it was a horror movie but it wasnt. i saw it over the weekned I was really disappointed.
5,creepy and crawly,"Great eerie terror flick, that will have you glued.Ignore bad reviews,these people trash bodycount movies for unoriginality and then trash a good original movie like this when they finally get it!"
2,The Worst Ashley Judd Movie,"There is not much to tell about Bug. The highlight of this movie is Ashley Judd. That's pretty much it. The story is about a guy that comes to live with her. He is infected with a virus that drives him insane. He believes that bugs are invading their home and are out to get him. She soon becomes infected by the virus. They both go insane and set the place on fire. This movie is not worth having. It's good for a chuckle if you're bored and need something to do, but definitely don't buy it."
1,Worse Film Ever!!!,"I saw this in theaters, and almost everyone in the theater hated this film. It was a horrible waste of time to sit through."
2,"What happened, Ashley?","Bug (Special Edition)Given the fact that Ashley Judd is my favorite actress, I struggled with this. I believed that she chose her scripts very carefully. This is a big thumbs down. Her acting abilities are great, but wasted on such a painfully ridiculous plot. I'm not saying that the situation isn't feasible- But Ashley is so much better in legal dramas."
1,Made no sense even when they tell you what happended!,"I went to see this movie with some friends and we tried to get into the movie but all we could do is sleep, some parts looked like it was getting interesting but then it goes back to being dull and weird. The guy was crazy and all he did was convince the other girl to be crazy to. I found this movie funny and useless. One more thing if you do decide to watch this, the sex scene makes no sense because in real life if a guy said ""I haven't been with a woman in a long time."" and then gets sex from saying that, just don't buy it if anything rent it."
1,It'll BUG you alright,For those of you that rated this movie above 1 star you must have some investment in it. This is the Worst movie I have ever wasted my time watching in my entire life. Blair Witch was more entertaining and that was the second worst movie I have ever seen.
1,Is Ashley Judd that hard up for work?,"One of the worst movies of all times. There is nothing more painful than trying to watch this movie at home. The horror is watching this movie. There it is, I figured it out. They figured out how to bring torture into your life by watching this movie at home. Brilliant!!! But still a horrible movie. People giving this movie a good rating must be the producers trying to get their money back..."
3,A Really Messed Up Movie!!!,"This movie is messed up. About a woman named Agnes who tries to get away from her ex-husband and ends up falling in love with a psychopath named Peter. Peter thinks there are tiny little bugs in the room and in their skin, pulling Agnes into his crazy thoughts. They begin to think it's a conspiracy against them and Peter makes Agnes think about suicide to get themselves away from the bugs. At least there is a pretty good sex scene. If you like messed up movies, you might like BUG!!!"
1,CALL ORKIN!,"In this claustrophobic tale set in a low rent motel in nowheresville, Ashley Judd's character meets a whacked-out Gulf War vet. The latter is convinced that the government has implanted insects into his skin. The story unfolds with deepening levels of paranoia within the walls of the seedy motel until a self-immolating climax at the end.I guess the multiple cans of Raid and flypaper strips didn't work.The pacing is glacial. The plot is thin and unconvincing.Other than that, it's a great movie!This stinkeroo needs a can of Glade air freshener to dispel the stench."
1,Disappointment,"I love Ashley Judd....but really what was she thinking? This movie was nothing at all like I thought it would be. It's extremely weird, but not the good weird, it's just stupid. It could have been good, but wow I was so amazed how ridiculous it was. I wasted an hour and a half of my life hoping it would get better every minute and it never did. I thought maybe my boyfriend would like it, he graduated with a psychology degree, and I had read in some reviews it was a great psychological thriller...he HATED it. After it ended, we both just looked at each other and said ""What?"" If you must see it, rent it, even though it's not worth those few dollars to me."
1,31 gave 5 stars !!??,"I tried to watch this movie till the end and i did thinking something big would happend but...... nothing happend !! This movie is sooooo boring ! Its not a horror movie, their is no bugs, its a movies about 2 crazie people seing bugs everywhere. I am sorry m.Friedkin, but this did not do it for me...... time to watch The exercist to change my mind !"
1,there is nothing worst,"i just like to sy this movie is so bad its not worth to rent it, dont ever watch this movie even if is the last movie on earth, simply the worst."
4,"This ""Bug"" has Bite!","This is one of those films in whether you love it, or you hate it. If you're a fan of Friedkin's other works (The Exorcist, The Sorcerer), then this one has all the tension cranked up on full load. Some of the other reviewers gave this 1 Star, but that is probably because this is not an easy film to watch, almost to a point of not wanting to look at the images Friedkin throws at the audience. But that is his trademark, to shock, to terrify, and to get under your skin and make you think about what you saw for many days after.Ashley Judd does an excellent job and the rest of the cast hold their own as well. Also make sure you watch the ""Discussion with William Friedkin"" on the bonus material, you'll understand him for not only being one of the most talked about ""control freaks"" in Hollywood, but you'll understand why he was and what he was intending to do with his audiences.Pure genius."
3,BUG is a little creepy,"are they insane, or are they govt experiments?-this for you to decide. small town abused wife loser(ashley judd) meets a ""FRIEND"" who seems just aweebit different than other folks in town. seems that the ""FRIEND"" might have brought some(bug) into her place. the pacing is slow and deliberate and is quite engaging as we get to know the characters. we have plenty of action and interaction before all is said and done. I just love harry connick jr-when he is a bad boy and his performance is right on. gore, full frontal nudity, and plenty of just bizarre behavior. this could become a cult trash classic. huge over the top performances and I have a feeling there WILL NOT be a sequel too. if you want something alittle different then get your money ready."
5,The Ataris meet Jimmy Eat World and The Foo Fighters!,"Life just isn't fair sometimes. The Ataris are becoming famous while an amazing group like Ethyline remains in obscurity. This is a great band! If you like Jimmy Eat World or The Ataris, you should really own this CD because Ethyline is better than both of 'em! Powerful guitars, great singing, great songs and just a really good band. I highly recommend this CD."
2,not MHC's best.,"MHC strayed away from her usual storytelling style. It wasn't really anywhere to go with the plot. I applaud her for her realistic portrayal of Laurie's MSD, but that's all the plot had going for it. Laurie was accused of a murder that we are led to beleive that one of her personalities commited. There really weren't a lot of suspects to consider. This book does not prove to be memorable for me. But first time readers, please don't be discouraged. MHC will reel you in with others. Specifically with ""Pretend You Don't See Her"", and ""I'll Be Seeing You""."
1,Didn't like this book at all!!,The story seems thrown together with a very anti-climatic ending and very predictable. I also feel the story ends to abruptly. Disappointing to say the least.
5,Great!,"Well, i usually don't enjoy reading so much, i tend to pick up a book read the first chapter and get bored after awhile, but this book, i could not put down!! it was a great book!!, and i highly reccommend it to anyone!! very suspenseful!"
5,Read this if you like Suspense!,"Another great book. Laurie Kenyon is snatched from her home at the age of four and dropped off at a local school two years later. To deal with the trauma of this event, Laurie makes up alter personalities. As she seems to get control of her personalities, she blames herself for the death of her parents. We follow Laurie twist in and out of her multiple personalities as they begin to take over her mind and body. As she goes through years of counseling the memories that seem to have been forgotten rise to the surface. And then she is accused of killing her college professor, and none of her personalities can remember killing him. I really enjoyed reading this book. A quick suspensful read."
3,It was okay...,"I'm sure this book is good to many people, but for me it was more of a letdown. I never found the desire to pick it up and read it until the last quarter of it. At that point, though, I was only reading it to finish it.I never grew attached to any of the characters, either, due to the lack of character development. I will say that it was interesting to read about multiple personality disorder, though. I'm pretty sure this just isn't my kind of book, so if you're a fan of Mrs. Clark's writing, I don't doubt you would enjoy this."
4,Good Read,"Good book, good story. Keeps your interest and makes you care about the characters. The twists and turn are interesting and help the story line."
5,April's Riview,"Mary Higgins Clark is an amazing writer. She captivates the readers mind and I love reading her books. My all time favorites are All Around The Town and Loves Music, Loves To Dance. What a wonderful author."
5,A Rivoting novel,I first started reading Mary Higgin's works on recommendations from friends. I was surprised at how I couldn't put it down. This novel portrays an interesting look into the stange and misunderstood disorder of multiple personalities. If you want some suspenseful reading I will definatly recommend this book! :)
5,this is the best book i have ever read,the story in this book was marvoulos. Mary higgins Clark went into such good detail and it really is a great book to read.
4,Clarifies policies that help single mothers,"This 1988 book addresses the growth of single parent families. Its aim is to detail and suggest policies which benefit families headed by single mothers. It gives the history of the single mother phenomenon. Talks about the problems of child care and poverty, as well as difficulties with time management and employment. Presents case studies and examples from the U.S. and abroad. A good resource for feminist social workers."
4,Excellent Kit with good instructions,"The kit is very easy to follow and isn't too bad on the old elbow greese. It comes with everything you need to complete 225 sq. ft., so make sure you have enough kits to do your flooring.The photographed kit is the old packing. We ordered one kit & then discovered we needed another for the square footage. We ordered another kit (the exact same one), it came with slightly different instructions & different materials. Make sure if you order more than one to request all new or all old kits! They are the same, just one has a catalyst agent you have to add & the newer version already has it mixed.Have FUN!"
5,"What a HAPPY, LITTLE BOOK!","I have to repeat it, WHAT A HAPPY LITTLE BOOK! Being in the animal care field (I work at a non-profit, privately funded shelter) not only do I collect books on animals, of course, I see a lot of sad situations everyday in my field. When this book arrived from Amazon (prompt as usual), after a hard day at the shelter, I was immediately overjoyed by the beauty of it and it helped me realize ""Yes, this is why I do what I do, because people care""! The photography is excellent, sort of a photojournalistic point of view and the style of printing is in a soft, sepia tone. The captions for each photograph are right on target. Now to order her book on dogs...."
4,"How to ""stand up"" after the horse you ride bucks you!","This book is a must read for any individual who is involved in corporate downsizing. This book gives you a sensitive understanding of how one can associate their identity with an employer. Mitch uses analogies that one can easily relate to in defining how your self-esteem becomes a part of the corporation you are leaving. In addition, he gives the basics of how you can put your life back together. These basics includes preparing a budget to remain financially afloat, reviewing the current situation before making plans for the future, etc. This is a good book that tells a dramatic story of his downsizing before revealing what to do to get back on track!"
2,Not so funny,"I am a fan of Chevy Chase and he is good in this movie. Miller is good too. All the acting is good. The problem with the movie is plot. It is his birthday, he finds the money, his wife gets ""discovered"" as an artist, and the wife is having a surprised birthday party for him. So many small things to wrong in the movie to keep the certain characters in the plot, it makes the whole thing uncomfortable. It is like a ""Fawlty Towers"" episode on steroids without the laughs. There a few chuckles in the movie, but it just doesn't justify the frenetic pacing. Penelope does the best she can with a strange role. She plays a depressed drunk for most of the movie. Chevy hits his part just right, but he isn't given much to work with. Even before I read that it was a movie made from a play, I knew it was a movie made from a play. It had a claustrophobic feel. Most of the action takes place within the house.The movie frustrated me more than made me laugh. It just was not funny."
2,"Two great actor, one bad film","This movie was developed from a stage play and shows it. Unlike most movies adapted from plays (think Harvey here) the director kept most of the action in a limited confine, the brownstone in New York.I made it through the first 45 minutes or so then left it to play while I went and cleaned the kitchen. Nothing I heard of the remaining movie made me come in to watch anything happening on the screen. It became just background noise.Chevy Chase and Penelope Ann Miller seemed to be trying their best to rescue this dog, but even good actors can't work with poor material! Bypass this and choose something else to see either of these stars."
5,great detail/ great for any collection,If you love WWII models but dont feel like putting them together this is for you. The detail is amazing. A great addiction to any collection. Even my wife has grown to enjoy my military model collection. Cant say enough good things about this product. You will want to buy more when you open the box.
3,Picture incorrect: has only one signature,"Ordered one before Xmas when the price on the ball dropped sharply (less than fifty clams at the time). Was expecting to get the dual signature shown in the photo, but instead only got the chickenscratch Kanji autograph. Ended up returning this one given the inaccurate photo."
3,Product presentation improvement,The item should have wider margins near the binding in the middle. Its much too difficult to read it in the present form.
2,Oh misogyny,"Great tool, too bad it's so misogynistic (and ignorant in other ways as well). I stopped being able to focus by the third chapter. To anyone who responds to this charging me with being overly concerned with political correctness- the authors used, as an example of sublimation, women executives and heads of faculty as an example of females sublimating their sadistic hatred of males. There are many other examples of weirdness and political incorrectness in this book..... and I understand it's a mark of the times (1940s), perhaps, but why doesn't the publisher at least revise it to correct these things??? It hasn't been updated since the 1970s. There are many more examples of just plainly ignorant statements and these sincerely detracted from my learning experience. I would have loved this guide but often found it hard to concentrate due to confusion and annoyance."
2,"Though new words were added, some 1942 prejudices remain","While the exercises and word lists are good, the editors of this 1998 update of a 1942 classic unfortunately failed to update all of the definitions. If you wander through the medical fields, you'll note that all doctors are referred to as ""he."" Also, the example for the word ""sublimate"" describes a woman who accedes to power in an all male environment as sublimating her distaste for men by dominating them. Not recommended for purchase by libraries or schools (or liberal thinkers!)."
4,so far so good : ),"This book is great so far - very short chapters, actually finish one chapter every day on my way back home from work. I've only finished 5 chapters, so I can only say so much, but it seems clear, well organized and really uses some creative ways to make sure you remember the new words. I recommend!"
3,It's okay,Dear Sir/ MadamI love that item. It's good for my studied. I think it good usage for the student.Thank youFrom Sophat UN
2,"It's a great idea, but it seriously needs an update.","This is a book I guess no one feels the need to update because it's just a book of definitions and you can make up your own vocabulary exercises. But, it is highly outdated. For example, they still refer to people of Asian decent as ""yellow races (p99)."" WOW. But, I'm studying for the GRE's and I guess the words they test only people from the 1920's use them, so it might be appropriate for standardized test vocab cramming."
5,May have helped me,"I used this book to prepare for the GRE. It was recommended to me by a professor. It really seemed to help me. My score went up by 200 points (on the old grading system). I had also prepared in other ways, but this book was part of my studying."
5,Poems by Jimmy Stewart,"This book came early. I love Jimmy Stewerts poems. I remember him reading them on the Johnny Carson show. Not many poems in the book, but totally worth it. I will buy from this seller again."
5,"Jimmy Stewart, the poet",We were very pleased to have been able to find this book by Jimmy Stewart. It arrived in good condition and in a timely manner. It is a wonderful book filled with the interesting stories behind his endearing poems.
5,everything totally acceptable,This product was hand delivered. Good condition. Delivered the next day.Sorry to have not responded sooner.
3,Machines never seemed more erotic than in this book!,"An interesting collection of erotic shorts that give the reader a whole new sensual perspective of machines. A nice addition to any erotica collector who is looking for new pleasures with everyday household and even kinkier devices. Imaginative takes on eroticizing appliances such as taperecorders, p.c.'s and even futuristic stories about the future of technology and sex. It makes you look differently and even a little lustfully at the objects around your home!"
4,Erotic machine stories are a mixed bag.,"Eros ex Machina gathers together countless stories that treat macines in a sexual manner. The stories run from the playful (Unbalanced) to the truly disturbing (Wearing Her Don't-Talk-To-Me Face) with a few that are actually erotic. Although an uneven collection at best, there is bound to be at least one or two tales that rock your world. Recommended."
3,Torchire Floor Lamp,"The lamp was late being delivered, but I called and when they saw their mistake they sent it by overnight shipping, no extra charge. We had a few problems putting it together, and it doesn't exactly stand straight. We had to sheem it. But it's ok I guess. Could be better, considering the price."
1,Very unpleasant reading for doctors,"The ATLS book for sure is not a book for those who are interested in the art of trauma support, as it is extremely superficial in its comments, as well as having not the really necessary informations that we, physicians, need. It has to be reviewed by the authors in order to start helping us, and not the contrary."
2,we need more than this,"American College of Surgeons did a good job - made a ATLS. But I feel the same way as comments by others - it's too superficial for trauma physician and behind the age. Now the arts of caring trauma patient has much more width and depth -lots of new surgical/noninvasive skills, fluid therapy in shock, measuring shock severity and guiding treatment method, even molecular basis theory - SIRS etc. American College of Surgeons should do more. Organize and revise ATLS , Urgently."
4,"Magnífico, pero requiere estudio...","Este libro es magnífico no importa el estilo de iaido que practiques, sin duda hace falta leerlo con detenimiento y obliga a tener un conocimiento previo sobre el Iaido, siendo mi primer libro en el tema me tomó un tiempo comprenderlo, por supuesto es necesario hablar y leer inglés fluidamente, pero te invita a un mayor conocimiento sobre este apasionante tema... si el iaido es tu vía, entonces este es tu libro."
1,Dull and inaccurate,"This book is basically an attempt to get Americans all worried about a pretty harmless and pathetic bunch of right-wing cranks. Goodrick-Clarke blows their antics up to gargantuan proportions--along the way getting detail after detail wrong. Those who know anything about the American Right will find inaccuracies on--literally--every page... This book is pure sensationalism, not scholarship. It is also obviously a shameful attempt to capitalize on the hysteria following Sept. 11, by raising the bugaboo of ""terrorism"" throughout. Americans have little to fear from people who practice rune yodeling and believe that Nazi saucers are docked in Antarctica. In addition, the writing is dull. The whole thing is shoddy and seems hastily slapped together. Do not waste your time with this book!"
5,Tasty,"Best rice cakes. The seaweed flakes are tasty and nutritious. When I want a crunchy whole-grain treat, this is what I eat."
1,shallow,"Quan takes an interesting predicament (that of a married call girl whose husband is eager for a baby) and churns out 300 pages of shallow nothing. Nancy Chan flits from one scene to the next, from hotel room sex to her shrink's couch to vanilla pillow talk. The point of it all is elusive. Are we supposed to find her plucky and endearing, or deceptive and shocking? She makes her husband seem so ridiculously naive you wonder how he finds his way home each night. This book did not meet its potential."
5,the further fun adventures of nancy,essential reading for all who enjoyed the first nancy chan novel. licking my chops in anticipation of more volumes!
1,EGADS!!!,It's not that I am a minimalist but I can only think of one word to review this book: YUCK!
2,What was she thinking writing this sequel,"I read Tracy Quan's first book and was pleasantly surprised so I when I came across this sequel at the book store I grabbed it up, what a waste of money.I thought that this book had the potential to have a decent story line but instead, it was pure trash with so much sexual detail that I thought I was reading a porn book. I was so disappointed in how this book ended and if all goes well, she will not make this a trilogy."
4,"terrific book, poor quality paper","This is an odd product. It's a terrific little book, a nice abridgement of Alice's adventures, complete with enlarged illustrations of Tenniel's wonderful work. As such, it is a valuable book to me. But at the same time, it was made to be a coloring book, and is printed on coloring book-type paper--cheap, gray and almost pulp. Perhaps there should be two versions--a better-quality publication for those who love the story and the illustrations, and this one, for little children to desecrate. That said, the illustrations alone make this worth more than it costs. As others have said, buy at least two."
3,Alice in Wonderland Coloring Book,"Was looking for a classic, old-fashioned coloring book telling a children's story. The pictures were lovely, but because of the detail, I was disappointed that the book was not larger. I also like to use ink vs. pencils, and so wished that the pages were on heavier paper. This coloring book is not for young colorers."
5,Beautiful book!,This isn't just a coloring book. This book has the most beautiful illustrations that go along with actual readings of the Alice in Wonderland story. I refuse to color in it. It's so beautiful and is a great addition to any Alice collection!
5,Eric Burdon Reborn,"Without a doubt, this is Eric Burdon's best album since Sun Secrets. His voice remains resonant and strong, and his backup musicians are truly talented. Most of the songs are blues, which has always been his favorite, but one cut almost sounds like an Irish folk song, and my favorite, Over the Border, is a rocker. My only concern is that the overall tone of the album is melancholy, with many references to death. I certainly hope that doesn't indicate that Eric is depressed, in the way that Del Shannon was just before he committed suicide. Burdon has been my favorite singer since 1964, and I would like him to continue putting out great albums like this for many years to come."
5,"Magnificent, Sensational, Outstanding, Fantastic, Terrific.","What kind of words can I use to describe this new CD by a journeyman vocalist whom most of you have probably heard of? All of the above. Seldom in today's recording industry does an album reach out and grab you with it's full creative force behind it which the artist has learned over 40+ years, thru countless miles on the road and association with some of the best artists in the world. The result is Eric Burdon today and he has never sounded better. If you liked any of Eric's music in the past, be sure to get this one, it will reach out and grab you."
5,Absolutely Perfect.,"Eric Burdon has never left his music nor his friends and fans. There's no reason to leave the 60's behind, Eric has brought them back to us-in a more mature, yet powerful, work. Absolutely perfect."
5,My Secret Life,"This CD is Erics first studio-album since I Used To Be An Animal who was released in 1988. The recording of it actually took place in 1986.Now, after a break of almost 20 years, Eric is back with a new album. This is perhaps his best work ever. At least his best work released on CD! The first thing that strikes with me with this album is its wide spectre of songs; The latino Motorcycle Girl who geniously captures the picture of a relationship at its end to the jazzy Jazzman to the hard-hitting, Hammond-dominated Over The Border.A MUST for anyone who'd like to support a great artist and own a great piece of music!We're holding our breath, waiting for the next album, Eric!"
2,Not quite...,I own albums preceeding this one as well as Doomsday Machine that came after and I must say I'm a bit confused after hearing this. Angela's vocals are just as good as ever but the music is a bit disappointing. There are some allusions to Metallica and Megadeth thrown in with material that is unique to this band but when you compare the music to Wages of Sin or Doomsday Machine the intensity and creativity is missing. The albums from before they had Angela in the band were all but ruined by their lame male vocalist who sounds like a dying mule but at least the music was inspired and way more creative than this. Tracks like Instinct on this album are rediculously simplistic and really just not up to par for a band as talented as this. Its still half way decent when compared to albums by some other metal bands but i don't recommend buying this if you're a fan of AE's other work.
4,Good... but not quite enough for 5 stars,"I bought Anthems of Rebellion on impulse; I saw it on the shelf at the music store, and figured that since Wages of Sin was pretty good, they should have done better this time. I guess if you like faster guitars, you're going to love it, but since I'm more into heaviness than speed, this didn't do it for me. It was a little better than Wages of Sin, particularly Erlandsson's precision drumming. The guitars were fast, but like the speed or not, you gotta give it to the Amott brothers for their skill. The only thing I wish they'd do is drop Angela! She sounds horrible on here; like a cross between Dani Filth and a strangled cat. Such a sound could work in many cases, but not with the music of Arch Enemy, which continues to soften up and become less intrusive. Lyrically, it's nothing new. Anyway, if you liked Wages of Sin, then you'll probably like this one. And ignore Fred Durst's bed buddy; we don't need any ebonics on the metal review pages."
3,poop,"would you like a cleveland steamer? cuz i could give you one right now. yum yummy right on your chest. yea thois albums intresting, not really sweedish or meolodic anymore. its got some good points though, the ammot brothers are amazing lead players as awlays. but anyway im gonna poop on your chest"
3,?,"in all honesty this release from Arch Enemy for me turned out to be a disapointment, but i do say that this album is good lyricaly, but vocaly and musically it was a let down, on it's own it is an ok album, but hails in comparison to ""Wages Of Sin"". in all ""Anthems Of Rebellion"" is still a good listen."
3,lacking...,"when you listen to an arch enemy record, you exspect melody and complexity. this lacks both. it has a few good moments but it could have been way better. i did really like the clean vox. its some of their best, thrown in with some of their worst. i think they corrected this problem with doomsday machine, which was really good. if you are just starting to listen to arch enemy, buy wages of sin or stigmata. this one is for diehards only."
3,Dissapointing,"This sounds NOTHING at all like old Arch Enemy. The Amott brothers have lost their creative touch, the vocalist is okay, but her voice does not fit this style of metal. I think she would fare better in a black metal-esque band. Every song sounds the same, the lyrics are utterly stupid and the musicianship is mediocre. I only give this three stars because the name Arch Enemy is still attached and the music is okay if your in a....I dunno, a sellout type of mood."
3,Joining the legions...,"...of uninspired, rip off melo-death acts is what Arch Enemy accomplish with this release. Which is a damn shame, cause I had high hopes for this band. They never came close to matching the perfection of sound achieved by Carcass, and were held back by a mediocre vocalist their first couple albums, but upon hearing Wages of Sin I felt new life breathed back into the band in the form of Angela Gossow. With a competent vocalist backing an already talented band, they released a pretty killer album.Unfortuantly, they close the doors that were opened for them from that album with Anthems of Rebellion. This isn't a terrible album, just a very uninspired album. If you've own any classic Swedish extreme metal there's no reason to buy this. I imagine they might have downloaded a whole bunch of tabs from various bands and attempted to recombine them during this recording session. Seriously, that's how uninspired this sounds. I guess I'll just hope the best for the next album..."
1,Excellent!,"Dont listen to the clowns that would call this 'nu metal' because they havent a clue as to what they are talking about.Arch Enemy does it yet again with this release , the only song I can do without is the opening intro , other than that this is top notch metal ! While some bands (Soilwork) may disappoint with a new release AE does not , 10 blistering tracks that literally kick the sh*t out of you each time you listen to the CD. Female vocals that make Kitty wish they were as bada$$ as AE , double bass that could easily wake the dead !Highly recommended."
1,mediocre,"Now, i dont want people to think i dont like melodic deathmetal only because i dont enjoy a.e.'s music...Arch enemy never realy impressed me to be honest--i can't get into their sound and i never could...If any thing ? They only bored me to death! I know plenty of melodic bands that aren't mediocre & will give Ae a run for their money--example ? Darktranquility,vehemence,children of bodom,darkane,in-flames,old mans child--well,there you guys go! Now, that i have given you an reason to stop support crap & such a mediocre abnd like arch enemy...Just stop supporting them! The bands i listed are all amazing & arch enemy isn't even closer to their sound! Arch enemy sucks!!!"
4,Found it at Last!,"I first read this collection of essays and short stories on a rainy afternoon in the reading room at a country club in Nairobi ten or fifteen years ago and was hooked. Several of the stories really stayed with me and I've been trying to find the book ever since. Finally, I asked the librarian at my school (who is nothing short of amazing) what little I remembered about this book - it was published sometime in the 1930s or 40s, it was a collection of work from Esquire and that it included Hemingway's ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro"". Shockingly, she was able to find it and via Amazon Marketplace, I had it in my hands three days later.It was worth waiting for.These are essays and stories that for the most part, would never be included in an anthology today - they are too much of their time; their humor is too quirky - but that is exactly why I love them. Reading at its best transports you to another time and place and these stories do that.Read it. You won't be sorry."
4,A refreshing collection of older short stories and essays,"I found this on Amazon after following the recommendation of a blog, and am so glad I did. I usually read more recent fiction, but the style and tone of these stories and essays is a wonderful change of pace from present day literature and is pushing me to read some of the classics again."
5,Viva Viveca 2,This artist grows with every listening of one of her albums. She is a treasure and so are her renditions; a rare jewel.
2,HP OEM what else can I say,It works fine... but they are so expensive... get a knock-off for 8 times cheaper.
1,A little short,Thought this was a good deal the twin pack (C8765WN#140) is not what arrives. Contacted by e-mail to much hassle to straighten things out to get other cartridge. The one sent is (HP-C8765WN#94) single cartridge. Don't know if it works as I leave it next to my computor as a reminder not to order again.
3,Different packaging than shown,"I did receive ink cartridges that seem ok. I have not opened yet, but they are not the Twin pack as shown but two individual packages with different color and packaged for a more ""international"" market. As I read other customer reviews I am hoping there is ink in them. Just FYI they are different from shown."
5,HP 94,Exactly as advertised OEM print cartridge. Shows up by my door as promised.I look forward to doing more business with these folks. Kudos to all.
4,"Gets the Job Done, but not worth the price","We all know ink cartridges are expensive. I wouldn't mind paying for these cartridges if they were made in such a way that the ink wouldn't dry up over time and render them useless in the course of using the portable printer that they are for. The printer is stored on my company vehicle since it is used remotely at random times.The printer has been designed for portable applications, but the ink cartridges were not. You cannot store the ink cartridges in vehicles, they will dry up. If HP made their ink cartridges for portable on-the-go applications, then they would be in line with their expensive prices. However, you must deal with the fact that the ink cartridges were not designed for portable applications, so store them accordingly to avoid problems."
4,HP 94 Ink cartridge order/ship/use.,"Good product, used for several years in All-in-One HP printer. Pricing and delivery from this supplier was impressive - ordered 8/30 - received 9/03. Nicely done; I'd buy again. Thank you."
5,HP 94 C9350FN140,"Got this for my husband, boy was he surprised. He was without ink in his printer for months. he loves it now that he can print"
3,Raises cultural awareness about Canada and Mexico,"This is a good book for anyone not familiar with the cultural differences, preconceptions and bias with the Mexican culture. Most text is devoted to history and the racial bias plus historical basis between the U.S. and Mexico. Canada is poorly covered. The reader will gain and understanding of historically justified suspicion of Americans and how Latin culture is structured from a business perspective. This book could be best described as a very short course in sensitivity training with just enough business horror stories to keep you interested. Those experienced in offshore trading will not need this book. Beginners will benifit and it is worth the price for them."
4,Good Tool!,this is much better than ones found at Home Depot. The smaller diameter cores are just the right size to penetrate hard compacted soil and the side vents prevent clogging.
2,Jams with dirt,"Seemed like a good Idea, but the thing just jams with dirt. It does make the holes but I assumes the hollow ""tubes"" were on this to cycle soil through, all it does is get dirt jammed in it."
2,bully Lawn Aerator,"I have had no luck with this thing. I am going to wait until fall and use it again, maybe lawn is to dry. I have used sprinkler and made the lawn real wet and that helped. but all in all not one plug has ever come out the top holes. go to hardware store and buy a piece of re-barb and stab holes in the lawn. would be cheeper and accomplish the same thing."
5,Wonderful Series.,"This is the final volume of the series and all I could really say at the end was ""wow"". If you've enjoyed any sci-fi anime in the past, this series is for you. Great way to finish things off for the Stand Alone Complex series, the only down side is, now I'm really looking forward to Solid State Society!"
5,Ingles para Latinos,Very helpful and clear. I have ordered 75 copies so far in the last 4 months--students find it clear and useful.
4,Español/Inglés Compañeros en Conversación,Viene con dos cintas.Nos gustó mucho encontrar este libro y Spanish for Gringos para usar para vocabulario in nuestro clase de pares aprendiendo inglés y español. (y el segundo nivel para los más avanzados). Desarollé unas lecciónes que usan los dos libros y tienen más práctica (porque el libro es casi puro vocabulario.) A los alumnos les gustan las cintas y las explicaciones fáciles en su misma idioma porque animan mucho. Y con un nativo para ayudarle pronunciar es aún mejor. Están invitando y pidiendo copias para sus amigos.
5,Use together with Speak English Like an American for Native Spanish Speakers,"Speak English Like an American: for Native Spanish Speakers (Habla ingles como los americanos) Book & Audio CD set (Spanish Edition)Taken together with Speak English Like an American for Native Spanish Speakers (Habla ingles como los americanos), a very good way to improve your spoken English."
2,disappointed,"A friend or mine wanted to learn English and asked me to find a good book for him, after the reviews from this book I expected it to be more than it was... just little tips on how to pick up words in English."
1,Bad Service,"I do not have received this item yet....Please, send me the item or return my money back.ThanksAntonio Marante"
1,Seasons for Praise,"The book came quickly and was in great condition. I was very disappointed in this book as I thought it would have some banners, ideas, and colored pictures of those items to show the completed item, and it was none of these things. I wish I had gotten something else. This is one reason why I would like to thumb through a book before I buy it, to see if it is what I am looking for and the style that I like."
5,Space Waltz,"Bought the original cassette back in 1975. Back then for a NZ group to release something like this was a bit of the the box.To this day it still sounds good ( I purchased the CD a couple of years ago) yep sounds like Bowie but what other artists don't sound a bit like each other.If these guys had been in any other country other than NZ they would have produced a lot more stuff . As it was just the one album and they were done and dusted. If you like Glam Rock give this a go, you won't be disappointed ."
2,nope not for 30,"The game itself was on it's way out because of the lack of content and buggy environment. Many servers there is difficulty find a battle other then the one cluster where all the worlds people are and even then it's not that much.Core combat split that up further. With more place to go explore, and more things to dig up, it has improved the content... at over half again the game price. That's 10$ per new vehicle. Sorry but that is just not worth it, the game is on it's way out and the developer time seems to be going to Star Wars Galaxies, the fair haired child of SOE."
1,"If there was a way to give 0 stars, I would.","This is pure trash. This man believes the Protocols of the Elders of Zion is true. He's a full fledged anti-Semite and his writings and interviews prove same. A tincture of truth mixed with 99% arsenic. Don't bother trying to find the book, it's filled with hate and blame for both Jews and Catholics."
2,Very Tight Fit,"These jeans run very tight through the seat and front. I have well over a dozen pants of identical size (various brands and styles, some also Dickies), and most all of them will fall off me without a belt. I'm tall and lanky. In these pants, I struggle to get a phone or keys out of the front pockets, and sitting down it's impossible. Seeing as how these are active work pants, it only makes things more difficult and I avoid wearing them. It's a shame because they're fairly robust and look decent."
2,Weird fit,"These did not fit like my other jeans. I bought 36 x 34 and these are 2-3"" longer. They measure about the same inseam as my other ones (34""), but when compared them from the waistband down is where I find the huge difference. I was planning to send them back, but they asked me to pay for shipping to return them. I will just wear them to work around the house. I certainly do not recommend these as a replacement for your regular jeans unless you already realize the fit of these are very different. I will try to upload a picture so you can see what I mean."
3,Painfully boring,"I think the content is OK, but this book droned on and on. It is an overview of intellectual property law. It seems to have been written for attorneys because the author uses a lot of terms of art, such as ""in rem jurisdiction"" and ""prima facie case."" Well, I am an attorney who took copyright and trademark law in law school, and I was still bored out of my mind. Unlike the other books in the Rich Dad series, it is not motivating or encouraging, just really dull. I finished it because I purchased it, but it was painful."
2,Review for the Audiobook Only!,"Please note that this review is only for the Audiobook. I ordered this book on CD to listen in my car. It is almost painfully hard to listen to and even harder to follow.The reader sounds almost like Casey Kasem (which you would think is a good thing, but it's not) and his voice almost never changes tone. He barely inserts appropriate pauses, and the information is just brutally hard to pay attention to and follow.While the actual information to the book may be alright, I would not recommend the audiobook to anyone.The only information I've truthfully ascertained is that at the end of the day, if you have a serious idea or trademark issue, you need to find a patent attorney. And that I already knew from law school."
1,Swindled,"I think I know how this book was written. A whole lot of cut and paste from U.S. Law code with some mediocre story telling sprinkled in. If you want to be technical and write in the language of professional law, fine. But this is not the series to do it in."
2,SUCH a dissapointment!!!,"Although I have found Robert Kiyosaki's books to be excellent, I am SO unimpressed, bored, and resentful of this book. Basically, it is almost 300 pages of this phrase right here: ""Get professional help"". There- done. You have now read the book. I agree with many of the other reviews here, in that it really isn't helpful to someone interested in protecting their ideas, but only helpful to Kiyosaki and the author. This is an ""Advisor"" series book, and it has made me skeptical of the rest of them. Sales Dogs is also not helpful unless you are already experienced in sales."
2,Dry and boring. Could barely keep my eyes open.,"Unlike the rest of the Rich Dad books that I've read -- which were for the most part fantastic -- this book was terrible. Michael Lechter may indeed be a very bright guy and a star in his field, but he is an absolutely horrendous writer. The intro by Robert Kiyosaki was the only really enjoyable part to the book. Lechter immediately jumped into complex explanations of the various types of IP protection available without really clarifying anything for the lay person like me. And no real life examples of anything -- just references to a couple hypothetical ""horror stories"" that he relays at the beginning of the book. The only reason I gave this book 2 stars and not 1 is because at the very least I was able to get some basic definitions of IP terms down. But I guess I could've gotten that from a dictionary too."
3,A young person's guide to the Spanish Civil War.,"Davis's book is for young people, but I was surprised of the content and well written material. One could guess this was an adult book.Davis is a black American and of a general liberal bent. As you read, you can tell the side he favored in this war--the Loyalists. He generally glosses over the abuses the Republican government commited during the Civil War, but expands on the attrocities perpetrated by Franco's forces. Oh well, Davis can slant the way history is perceived.I would say this is a well written book, if one overcomes the slant of Davis's writing. If one wants a more detailed analysis, read elsewhere."
4,Long Gone Songs,"This is a terrific CD set. It does however have a major flaw. It lacks two tracks from the A Salty Dog CD, the title track and Long Gone Geek. This being the case the statement on the cover that it contains the first four albums is incorrect. It also adheres to the British album format and thus lacks A Whiter Shade Of Pale from their eponymous debut."
3,no salty dog! no whiter shade of pale?,"I bought this, expecting to at least hear one of my favorite songs of all time,""a salty dog"".Where is it? Not on the ""SALTY DOG ALBUM""!It's a great value,4 albums for 15 or 16 bucks,but jeez,the 2 biggest hits are missing!!Will probably return it for another compilation,maybe salty dog + 3,or something."
5,A fun family outing with the Bears,"In ""The Berenstain Bears by the Sea,"" co-authors Stan and Jan Berenstain take Mom, Dad, and the two cubs to a vacation by the seashore. The cartoony illustrations of the humanoid bears are visually delightful, and the easy-to-read text is great for younger readers.Although this book is meant for an audience of young children, I must admit that, as an adult reader, I found it quite enjoyable. How can you resist lines like ""May we? May we? / May we, please, / dip our tootsies / in the seas?""This book portrays a family that genuinely enjoys spending time together. And it even teaches a lesson in the virtue of patience. This Bears romp is a great choice for the beginning reader."
4,"the Berenstain Bears, to funny","The book called By the Sea is funny. It was written by Stan and Jan Berenstain. This book is funny because it describes my family in a few ways. First they go on vacation every year, so do we. Next, Mother bear says clean up before having fun. My mother would say that. This book is funny because it seems like all mama and papa bear wanted to do is wait and have fun with their kids. I don't have a favorite character because everyone in the book is my favorite. There are so many books about the berenstain Bears so go out and read them because they are funny and caring."
1,Beware! Amazon's Product Description is Incorrect!,This product is advertised by Amazon as being a set of DVDs (as of 10/26/2010). These are NOT DVDs; they are CDs.
5,Tony's techniques work...if you use them,"If you really listen to what Tony has to say and you DO IT, you will see results. I've been reading and listening to his stuff for nearly 20 years now. And when people ask me about some of my achievements, I find myself describing behaviors that I learned from Tony. This program is ideal for someone who maybe has a lot of energy and enthusiasm but just doesn't quite know how to get started. Tony's methods will give you a way of directing your energies. But if you are the type to sit on the couch and proclaim how ""none of that stuff really works"" then save your money, stay on the couch and keep telling yourself all those successful people got there by ""luck."""
5,Tony is great,I love this series of CDs. They are inspiring and offer a lot of insight on living optimally. I would get this series if you want to improve your life and achieve your goals in life!
2,THIS IS NOT A DVD!!!,"THIS IS NOT A DVD!!! This is a set of 7 audio CDs. The one I ordered was listed as 'New', but the box they came in was pretty beat up and the first CD was not in the plastic wrap like the other 6. And it had fingerprints on the playing surface.THIS IS NOT A DVD!!! Change the description, please. It's misleading."
1,not for me,I thought this cassette was useless. The material was strange and not something I would apply to my life.
2,Put it in writing,"Sounds True, maybe--if I could comprehend what Dr. Estes is saying in much of audio book--sound quality poor. I returned this item."
4,WOW!!!,"I LOVED IT!!!! THE BEST SPONGEBOB DVD YET!!!!! But I think that the episodes could have been better. Also, the graphics could have been better.All in all,it was a ''wow'' dvd. If you collect spongebob dvds like I do, you WILL want this dvd."
2,Thermometer covers,"These are okay thermometer covers. As an occupational therapist, I worry because they tend to rip easily and I definitely don't want to spread germs between patients. They are better than some other ones I have used though! Overall, these are okay."
2,Narrow and compilative overview of Judaic mysticism,"The book is written by the former President of the Israeli Academy of Sciences. It reflects traditional Orthodox view on the greatest pages in the Jewish history - Qabbalah, Shabtay Zvi and Hasidism, with a slight covering of scientific speculations. Qabbalah is described without any connection or association with the Egyptian or Chaldean mysticism. No word is said about the great Jewish gnostics. The only question is if the author consciously lies or subconsciously avoids problems, which still remain out of the Israeli national concensus."
4,A Scholarly Look at Mysticism,"For those of you who want to understand where and how the major trends in Kabbalism developed, look no further. This book covers all of the major ideas in their proper historical context, from Gnosticism to Hasidism.The author's concept or purpose is to dispel many of the misleading, and speculative notions on the nature of Jewish mysticism. In the process, taking the mystical/magical portions for the most part out of the equation.What I like best about Scholem's work is that he is not so concerned with what the meaning of each Kabbalistic notion but is primarily concerned with where it originated and what circumstances allowed for the development of an idea. This allows for an objective and unbiased consideration of the concept being studied.What you won't get in this book that you will find in most others about this subject is the promotion thereof. No evangelical tendencies exist which make for a more throrough reading."
4,A Good Book,"I read this book after Dangrous Games (another book in this series).It was nice to read about Dido as she was a child.I have enjoyed this book.If not by the story than by the delightful castof characters,starring Dido,Pentinence,Nate,Captain Casket and Aunt Tribulation.I recommend this book to children of all ages."
3,Too Dreamy,Music beautiful but too dreamy.........can easily put you to sleep. My fault...should have previewed first. I was looking for something more lush and upbeat like much of his other stuff.
5,Flat Pencil Review,"Love Love Love these pencils, what a great idea!I'm going to order the glitter pencils next. Long wearing and colors are really nice!"
2,"Small, waxy, difficult to use","It feels as if it's expired. It doesn't go on smoothly at all, and it requires a special sharpener. Overpriced"
1,Buyer Beware! NOT the original Stella Doro that we remember and loved...,"DO NOT PURCHASE THESE!!!! THEY ARE NOT THE REAL THING. I ordered alot of these cookies thinking I'd hit the jackpot in finding them. I was so excited and coudn't wait for their arrival. They arrived today and when I quickly opened up a package (carefully placing the other treasured packages in the freezer), I was soooooooooooooooo disappointed!!! They are nothing like theh originals and I feel like I've been definitely duped by purchasing these imposters.They are very crunchy, not the same texture of the original and the fudge center is almost fake looking and tastes nothing like the fudgy center of the original. They are awful and I'm stuck with 12 packages of them. I guess I should have believed it when I heard they stopped making them or closed down the factory...whatever the story was/is.Anyone want some cookies?"
4,slightly oldy but still goody,"These are great cookies, and the last time I ordered them they were very fresh tasting. This time they were not as fresh tasting but they were still wonderful!"
2,Started well then ....,"I really wanted to like this book. It started out well enough and I almost gave it 3 stars. However, I asked myself if I'd recommend this book to anyone and changed to 2 stars. The beginning started out well and I really liked the interaction between Justin and Kate. I did find Kate's struggle with Vampirism interesting. But, when Kate decided to become a rock star the book took, IMO, a turn for the worse. It was too contrived. When I did get to the end of the book it started to pick up again, but with only a few chapters left. The book would have been much better without the rock star section which was a big chunk of the story and expanding on the evil doctor and Justin relationship. I think Gail decided to write about what she was most comfortable with (rock n roll bands) than what could have been a great story."
4,60 minutes of full motion video on one SD card!,"I love the space! I can get 60 minutes of full motion video (640x480) on this one 8gb card. I video tape volleyball matches and this makes it possible for me to not have to keep switching cards out of my camera. The only issue I have with it is that it will not read in any of my PC's, PhotoBank or even in my Dell Axim. The card is simply not recognized at all since it is an SDHC card. I can only download the video into my PC through my camera (Canon Powershot S5 IS). I also purchased a 4gb Transcend SD card and that card does read in my PC's, PhotoBank and Dell Axim. Apparently there are special jump drives out there that can read the SDHC cards but I haven't researched it yet. However, I still love the the ability to shoot an hour of video without having to change out the card!"
5,A lot of Memory for a Great Price,I got a new digital camera with more pixels and needed more storage. This more than takes care of my needs and I don't have to worry about running out of room because of using the video option a couple times.
5,Works great! Very fast txfr with SDHC card reader.,"Very fast memory. Used for video recording, and no problems. Getting 2 hours in high quality record mode.With an SDHC usb card reader, it transfers 8 GB in a few minutes, faster than my DVD drive."
1,Wish I could give it a 5 star!!!,"The reason I can only give one star is because after trying the card in my axim 50v & Canon 8 megabyte camera I find that it will not work in either one...so I guess I'm stuck with a card that is ahead of it's time for most products.I don't think that it's the cards fault, but the devices I have are just not sofisticated enough to read it, though they are relatively new and top of the line devices. I have no problem with a 1 gig card, and suspect that I will have not problem with a 2 gig card, maybe will try even a 4 gig, but the 8 gig, well, it just won't work for me."
1,Huge Mistake.,This card was unreadable in 2 different readers on two different computers. It was useless.
4,Pure Gold,This is one of the better compilations I've picked up in awhile. Definetly the best of what's going around now. All the songs are deliciously juicy. The tempos vary but it's all head boppin'- ye know when the groove gets in you? I knew a few songs off the album before I listened to it and the rest of the album is great. Almost every tune is madness.
5,Unforgettable!,"Once you've heard Don Shirley play a song, you never think of it in quite the same way again. He finds subtle meanings and emotions that everyone else (maybe even the composer) has missed. He has a remarkable and inimitable talent, and his work is never less than the best. This album is no exception to his standard of perfection."
3,Rehash,This is much of the same information as the earlier book by the same author. More a monologue of his life than a detailed account.
2,Not a good book for Beginers,"Being a beginner with ASP I bought this book as a tutorial to learn ASP. I have access to ASP professional Developers so I was able to ask a lot of questions in learning ASP. The code and explainations that are in the book are not clear and are hard to understand. I had to ask many questions. The code seemed to be hard to follow. The Developers that I have access to felt that the Author used too many 'functions' when they were not needed (this made the code hard to follow.) I am going to have to buy another book to learn from. This book may be good for refrence, but not learning from."
1,It's just inconceivable...,"Regardless of how good the text in any programming book is, the book is pretty much useless if there is not adequate support for the code - particularly in a ""By Example"" book - which this book purports to be. The book contains no CD to test your code against the authors. Well, that would be OK if there were the support files online - like Wrox has; but NO. No supporting code anywhere. And don't be fooled by the ""Where to find the Code"" heading in the Introduction - it just points you to sample code for a single chapter. I encountered ""internal server error HTTP: 500"" in one of the exercises, and wanted to test my code to what the author had written. No such luck. Was it me? Maybe. Was it the code in the book? I'll never know... Buy ""Beginning Active Server Pages 3.0"" published by Wrox. They know how to support their products. As for this publisher, they don't have a QUE."
5,good book with examples,author try to explain the material with examples.that is what reader wants.good book for beginers.worth for its price.
3,The Heart of The New Thought,"This book was recommended by a good friend. While the book was published in 1902, the message still is true for today."
5,Good Clean Fun,"I love the color pink, elephants, and home stuff - especially anything that will clean my other things.This is a cute, practical, and well made item that will add a touch of whimsy to your kitchen or bar. Also good for impressing, or mystifying, party guests as you clean up after them."
2,Running Out of Steam,"I've read all of the series in order. I think this is about the ninth book and the third from the last. I think Saylor's phoning it in. I really liked the early books and loved the combination of mystery and historical novel. The last three or four I read just weren't up to par. This book is alright in the context of the series, but it is disappointing and lacked creativity. Nevertheless I'll finish the series - in time"
3,A little too Misty for Steven Saylor,"I've read the whole Ancient Rome series by Steven Saylor and this one was a bit off track. Steven went off on an affair and deep feelings in this one, which over shadowed the history of the book. Thankfully the rest of the series was wonderful!"
4,Good historical entertainment,"This novel is another in Steven Saylor's ""Roma Sub Rosa"" ""Secret History of Rome"" series. In this one, the protagonist, Gordianus the Finder, falls in love with a beautiful woman who is apparently a seeress. When she is murdered, he seeks to find the culprit. All of this takes place against the backdrop of Julius Caesar's struggle with Pompey Magnus (""the Great One"") as Rome is riven with civil strife and intrigue.While this is not my favorite novel in the series, it is excellent historical fiction and an enjoyable read. The author departs from his usual linear storyline and instead presents the story as flashbacks. The technique is effective, if a bit jarring to Steven Saylor regulars such as myself. Recommended. RJB."
3,"Good, but not as meaty as earlier Saylor titles","This novel continues the marvelous and vivid life of Gordianus and his family. There is, of course, a murder to solve, and the characters and suspects are entertaining, particularly with the focus on women of Rome in this book. However, if you are expecting the depth or heft of ""Roman Blood"", ""Arms of Nemesis"", ""Murder on the Appian Way"" or ""Catilina's Riddle"", you will be disappointed. Like ""Rubicon"" and ""Last Seen in Massilia"", this book focuses on the Gordianus family, putting politics and intrigue on a back burner. At only 270 pages (as opposed to earlier works in the 450 page range) this is ""Gordianus Lite""."
3,Mist of Prophecies,"Satisfying read, good set up for next book. Nice addition to, but not my favorite of, the series.The flip-flopping of chapters from past to present took a while to get used to and while interesting is not a style I hope Mr. Saylor continues in the next book."
3,For teachers not children,"This book has the most wonderful traditional verses and the traditional woodcuts are fascinating. It also has descriptions of hand movements and other traditional actions that accompany the rhymes. A wonderful resource for a teacher or educator. If you are, however, buying the book for a child, this book is not suitable. The texts written in a small font are crowded together and the illustrations are tiny."
3,Thorough,"If you're looking for a book containing nursery rhymes outside of the norm, this book is for you. If you're not, don't buy this book. There are rhymes in here that I have never heard of. It is an interesting read, but not the classical children's nursery rhyme book I had in mind. The illustrations are in black and white and are very classical and old fashioned."
4,An interesting addition for a Yes fan.,"This DVD was about 85 minutes long. Using several critics, they reviewed and critiqued the first albums and songs of Yes. I liked: It was very interesting to hear the reasons the critics liked or disliked the album or song. There was also a guitar player that demonstrated the cord progressions on several songs. I did not like: The DVD did not play entire songs. There was just enough music to remind the viewer of what the reviewer was reviewing. Note: The documentary part of this DVD (about 60 minutes) is the sole content of another DVD titled: Inside Yes: Critical Review 1968-1973 (2005). The only difference that I could find between the two was that the Yes: Total Rock Review (2006) had about a dozen pictures in a gallery and Rick Wakeman playing solos of Long Distance Runaround, Awaken and Close to the Edge on a Steinway piano."
2,Weak entry,"Episodes 8-10, 3rd disc of 4This is the weakest volume of the series. Episode 8 is strictly a clip show summarizing the previous 7 episodes. You can't skip this disc though, as it resolves the plotline of Mitsuko's mother. Hmm, actually, maybe you can skip it.2.5 stars rounded down."
4,Adorable and Functional,"I am very pleased with this purchase. The monkey applique and green gingham trim are cute and made from quality fabric. The wood frame and canvas fabric are somewhat cheap, but they seem to be comparable to the other baby hampers on the market. The hamper would probably be too small for a larger child's clothing, but baby clothing fits fine. I have even tossed in heavier items (blankets, towels, etc.) and the hamper is sturdy enough to handle them. The removable mesh liner is convenient for toting laundry to the washing machine."
4,Departure from Navarre's escapades,"Amid the mixed reviews for Cold Springs, this one-off thriller didn't disappoint. One reviewer's comments about discomfort is accurate... it was hard for me to identify with many of the characters, and, as with many works of fiction, I had to suspend my disbelief on many occasions. But Cold Springs was an entertaining read. Though I thoroughly enjoy the Navarre series, I hope to see more departures from Riordan, lest he, and we, get a bit tired of Tres."
5,Thriller with phychological and multiple plot twists,My awareness of the intricacy of Rick Riordan's plotting began when I realized the main character was known only by his last name. This interesting linguistic twist indicates a distancing from intimacy and immediate knowledge about Chadwick's personality and history. I should know. I semi-dated a man who constantly referred to himself by his last name. The story is riveting and often doubles back to re-involve the original characters and reveal previously unmentioned details. I pre-ordered this book and will always pre-order this writer's novels.
1,Disappointed,"I had read the Percy Jackson series and absolutely loved it. I was intrigued by the desciption of Cold Springs. I was terribly disappointed with the swearing (f-word) within the first three pages! I didn't even read the whole first chapter before tossing the book - yes, the swearing was offensive enough to me to trash the book! If you are looking for a ""clean"" book, this is not it. I'm sure the story is great, but the language completely ruined it for me."
5,just what i needed,It works exactly as advertised just remember to keep the window rolled up for about 24 hours for it to stick
1,Buyer Beware: Not Organic,"The name shouts the word ""organic"" doesn't mean that the product is truly organic. The shampoo contains paraben, which is carcinogenic, and SLS, which is a skin irritant and a probable carcinogen. Due to lack of regulation on organic or green commercial products, it's quite easy for manufacturers to greenwash their products and mislead consumers. We'll just have to watch out for ourselves!"
4,Great!,"I am typically not a product line user, but this would make the 3rd product I've used by ORS and I love it! I bought the pack though to ensure I would like it, but once the pack runs out I will invest in the actual bottle. I had a lot of product build up on my hair and it cleaned everything away! It left my hair feeling soft and I used the deep conditioner right after. My hair feels like silk!"
1,Knots,This shampoo is awful. It left my hair so tangled and matted it took my hair out just to get the knots out.
3,"Great shampoo, but not great for my scalp","This was a great shampoo with the proper lather, wonderful smell and really moisturized my hair. It left my hair soft and healthy looking. Unfortunately my scalp didn't do so well. I've only been able to use Head and Shoulders to prevent my scalp from breaking out and every once in a while I try something else to see if it will work. This didn't do it, but if you don't have that problem, this shampoo would be great. This came highly recommended on transitioning sites, as I'm trying to transition from relaxed to natural african american hair."
5,"Love, Love, Love It!","I have relaxed hair and this product actually softens my hair when i use it. Ive never used a shampoo that softens my hair. Normally they tend to dry out my hair but this one does the opposite. I love the smell of this shampoo and the color makes it look like candy lol. Anyway, i pair this up with the replenishing conditioner and it works wonders for me. Its such a great buy."
1,Really Bad,"The worst shampoo ever. I used this and afterward my hair was extremely tangled, actually matted, it left my hair a matted mess - so then I used the conditioner and it was worse - my hair felt hard,dry and the tangles were beyond tangled I had to use my deva condtioner then shampoo it twice and use the conditioner again with about 5x as much as I normally would just to get the tangles out and my hair still felt rough. I put in extra leave in conditioner. I hate this stuff, I threw the new bottle away."
5,Aloe Shampoo,I like the organic root stimulator line of products and I love this shampoo. It really does improve the condition of your hair and leaves hair feeling nice and soft andhealthy. I would recommend it.
5,GREAT PRODUCT,This is a great shampoo it leaves my hair nice and smooth i can feel it clean and not using all the chemicals like other products.
4,Useful for Non-Majors,"I teach literature to undergraduate students majoring in interdisciplinary arts and sciences, business, computer science, and nursing. Since I can't count on them having had training in writing about literature, I often assign specific sections of this text, or make it recommended reading for students with less confidence in writing about literature.My students almost universally praise this text, and I think *their* opinions, rather than those of us teachers, are the ones that really count. They find the specific, nuts-and-bolts suggestions useful, and the explanations clear and helpful.I recommend this text to any student (high school or college) who wants a concise guide to writing about literature, and any teacher or professor whose students usually lack a solid background in literary study."
4,A mostly good intro. to college writing/literature,"""A Short Guide to Writing about Literature"" is a good little introduction to college-level writing skills and literature that is often taught at the college level. Helpful for those who struggle with writing, but not necessarily useful to individuals who already have good writing skills. The biggest drawback is the constat ""you can do it!"" attitude. Could be helpful to some who need that extra push, but I found it a little demeaning."
3,A Necessary Evil,"Written for the Intro to Lit university course market, this type of guide is a necessary evil. Barnet works: students can usually find what they need in the index or contents (How to write a good sentence, what makes a good paragraph, etc.). If you have to have one, you could do worse than to choose Barnett"
5,"Delightful, Humorous Story","Author Rene Gutteridge has delivered a surprising, delightful story in Boo. It is filled with humor and yet is an expertly crafted mystery. Don't miss it! I'm looking forward to reading the sequel - Boo Who. Ms. Gutteridge's books will be on my must-read list."
4,I peed my pants.........almost.,"I'm not ashamed to admit that my weak bladder fell victim to this funny book. I was looking for a light, pick me up that would put a smile on my face. Boo was exactly what I needed.It wasn't C.S. Lewis, so if you are looking for something that will enlighten and reveal deep spiritual truths, go elsewhere.Christians need to laugh too and Boo will definitely scratch your funny bone."
5,One of the cutest & funniest you'll ever read!,"This is a charming, hilarious book by a very gifted author. The characters are nutty, the town of Skary very unique and fun, and the story very sweet. This is the first in the series, but also the best in my opinion.If you read this book and like it, you absolutely have to read Rene Gutteridge's My Life As a Doormat - I think that is the best book she's ever written, even more funny than Boo. :-)"
3,It was okay,"This book was just okay. I loved the premise of the story, but the likeable characters were not developed enough for my taste and the annoying characters were really annoying and I found myself skipping over some of those parts. I liked the story and wanted to see what was going to happen next, but really didn't like reading some of the characters. In the Mitford series, even the quirky characters have some endearing qualities so you like them in spite of their weirdness. I didn't find that to be true with this book. I really didn't like some of them and wanted them to just be left out. I was looking for a good series and I think the story line has potential, but the development of it did not make me want to read the sequels."
3,"Think, obvious read","Got this for a book club. Thought it was too thinly written overall with way too much emphasis on the ""way"" through Christianity. Folks can be good, can be positive contributors to our community without having to ""find Christ."" As even a non-practicing Jew, I found this whole storyline somewhat offensive. However, even its weak points made for good book club discussion."
4,Lighthearted fun,"The premise for this story is perfect; Horror fiction writer becomes a Christian, and the town loses its tourist industry. The book was a fun read and very lighthearted. There were a few lessons thrown in there, in particular, finding out who had witnessed to Boo. A great read for anyone looking for something fun, light and with some romance thrown in. The story did lack some depth and some of the characters were a little stereotypical. But you could tell the author had fun writing this one and I think it may actually make a good movie."
4,Christian fiction with humor,"Boo by Rene Gutteridge is lots of fun to read. Gutteridge has lots of fun making plays on the characters' names and speculating about what life would be like in a horror author's hometown. Wolfe Boone's horror stories have built the town of Skary, Indiana. All of the local businesses make money from tourism based on his books. So what happens when Wolfe (known as Boo to the local townsfolk) has a spritiual conversion? Everyone's secrets will come out! Miss Peeples is a hoot! The Christianity seems more like a plot device than actual faith until the end of the book when Wolfe finally reveals who showed him the gospel. Ainsley obsession with Martha Stewart is fun, but sometimes seems to overwhelm her character. I look forward to reading the rest of the series and seeing how characters grow in faith and humor."
2,So disappointed - Audiobook,I wanted to stop; but had read all the reviews where it gets better and very scary toward the end.So I trudged on.It was slow and boring to begin with and worthy of eye rolling toward the end.Too many other good books out there to ever read another one of his.
2,okay,"it was a quick and easy read. a bit predictable - reminded me of his offseason&offspring books, minus the gore. not scary."
3,Ketchum's 2nd,"This is the third Ketchum book I read and I am quickly becoming a fan of his work. Hide and Seek is a story about a young, working class guy living in a small town. He becomes entangled with three rich summer kids, especially Casey a sexy temptress. The three rich kids are so bored in their lives that they take to doing stuff for thrills, stealing cars and shoplifting mostly. Eventually Casey sets her eyes on the town's local ""haunted house"" for the four of them to break into and play hide and seek. She gets her way and of course all hell breaks loose. This for me was Ketchum's least gory books that I read of his and a much less complex book. Although I did enjoy it I would have to say I liked Off Season (a particularily bloody book and a cult favorite) and The Girl Next Door (which is nothing less that a genius book about child abuse and absolute evil) better. But then anything you can get your hands on that is written by Ketchum is worth the time."
2,"HARMLESS, BUT NOSTALGIC INTEREST ONLY! 2 1/2 STARS!","I'm sure big fans of Frankie and Annette may have found this movie very enjoyable, but for most of us this film is pretty lame and corny! Most of the jokes fall flat, but the film does have a certain amount of charm. The first 20 minutes are OK, with our favorite surfer couple's son ""Bobby"" delivering most of the laughs! There are many cameos from old TV show stars in this film, but they are not all that memorable. It's hard to come down so hard on a family friendly movie that means so well, but this film is mildly entertaining at best! The DVD transfer is fine with no extras at all!"
3,FANS: REQUEST THIS DVD EXTRA...,"3 stars if they don't put this extra on, and 5 stars if they do.This is a great movie. But my favorite song ""We'll Go On Forever,"" performed at the end, was never released on the soundtrack. There will probably never be a new soundtrack, so please request that they give us this song as a bonus audio track in its full form. In the film, the song is interrupted by dialogue, so Paramount just needs to obtain the original song in its complete form. They could also add ""Pajama Party Tonight,"" which also was not on the soundtrack.""Do you worry 'bout tomorrow? Will it be as good as yesterday? I just look in your direction, and then I'm glad for what we have today. What I like about a love song is that you never can wear it out. You and I are like a love song- in the end, we always work it out..."""
3,Stevie Ray Vaughan,"Great Eighties, frankie and annette. One complaint, I bought this movie because of a scene I saw of Dick Dale and Stevie Ray Vaughan tearing up Pipeline. First time downnloading a movie from amazon. The scene was cut, best part of the movie In my opinion, that's why I bought it from Amazon. I'm not sure who's fault it is but that scene should Not of been cut from it, which made it a disappointment."
3,Beach Blanket Fun,"Campy, fun movie with Annette and Frankie. Cool scene when Dick Dale and Stevie Ray Vaughan jam together on a familiar surfer tune! Pee Wee just adds to the chaos of this parady on the 60's Beach Movies. Pure fun. Nothing more or less."
5,watch it,"Man,I loved that movie.Woah I even learned how to Jamaica Sky.It`s a great 80`s movie.You and your family,friends,or yourself will enjoy it and the music."
3,Back to the beach,very lighthearted a little bit slow in some places. On the whole a good watch. Frankie and Annette are always good entertainment. The son was a bratty kid who never seemed to get punished fot the things he did. Lori Loughlin was good in her character.
1,Not Quite up to the Originals...,"This was mildly cute, but, not even close to the humor of the originals, and, didn't even quite follow as a ""whatever happened to?"" of the characters from the Beach Party movies. First off, Annette's name in the Beach Party movies was Dee Dee (although, Frankie was still Frankie.) This was really a spoof of a spoof, y'know? Because, the beach movies were campy as get out to start with, but, they had an adorable quality to them, and a specific formula: Frankie does something stupid, Dee Dee gets mad. They flirt with other people to make each-other insanely jealous. They make up. (Yes, this happened here, too, but... meh.) And, where was Dead-Head, Animal, Candy, the Von Zipper Gang, for pity's sake? And, what was with Pee Wee Herman??? While the beach movies were made long before I was born, I still grew up watching them on the old movie channels and loved them. This I thought would be great, a ""what happened to?"". It, however, was a severe disappointment."
5,Much funnier than platoon,"There are quite a few people proclaiming this the worst movie ever made.They're wrong.This movie was so funny that I had to be rushed to the hospital for emergency intestinal repair surgery when it ended.This movie may be the answer you seek, even if the question is about dry cleaning. See this movie.Buy it, rent it, do something. We must save this before ""they"" ban it. It's an important piece of cinema, and a work of art.Most importantly, Salvador Dali loved this movie."
4,Oral-B Sonic,"I love my toothbrush, I have had it for over four years now. I have to say that the replacement head brushes are a lot of money. But... do I get complimented on my smile always? Yes, yes I do :D"
5,Hard to find item,"You buy something that works well and want to continue to use it, but there are always new and improved replacements coming on to the market, so, what is one to do? Tired of going to brick and morter stores only to be disappointed I went online to Amazon and found what I had been looking for, purchased it online, and received it as fast as I would have wanted. And what do you know? The product is genuine and actually works as ever I remember. Thanks."
4,Good but wear down quickly,I like my toothbrush and these heads. My only complaint is that they wear down quickly so you have to replace them often. I'm not sure if all electric toothbrushes are like this but it seems I replace these heads far more often than I ever replaced regular toothbrushes. Good product though and does a great job cleaning.
5,hard to find in stores,"The Oral-B Sonic replacement heads were hard to find in the stores. These were a good price, and it was very convenient to have them delivered."
5,Oral-B Sonic replacement brush head,Thank you for making this more affordable! Have checked many different places and they wanted way more than you!
5,clean teeth,Be sure to select the proper refill for your specific automatic toothbrush. I got our correct replacement the first time with Amazon. Excellent product!
5,I wouldn't go back to normal toothbrushes.,"I love these brush heads with my electric toothbrush, although they are very expensive.However, regardless of the price, i will continue buying these brush heads."
4,cleans ever so well,"perfect replacements for the original. Plus, the multipack comes in 3 slightly different colors, meaning that my fiancee and I can share the same base and swtich out the heads."
3,"It's ok, but too expensive","This is an old electric toothbrush by Oral-B, and you can't really get it anywhere in store, so the brush head *should* be cheaper, but nope, it's expensive.... decent brush heads though"
1,possibly fake heads - don't buy on amazon!,"i bought this set of replacements on amazon and so far 2 of the 3 heads are useless after only 2-3 weeks use. for some reason, after i used the first head for a couple weeks, the head wouldn't spin anymore; it would just vibrate. i thought it was just one of the very few defective ones that i was unlucky to get so i threw it away. i opened a second one and the same thing happened after just about the same amount of time (2 weeks). the brush heads look like new still but it's very loose and all it does is vibrate, it doesn't spin. beware- do not buy these on amazon, buy them at your local walmart or target instead."
5,good deal!,"Searched all over for these, hard to find, Amazon had the best price by far. the toothbrush itself is great, charge lasts a good, long time, & heads are easy to replace."
5,Great product!,"We were a little disappointed that none of the stores carry these toothbrush heads for the Oral-B Sonic Toothbrush anymore. But we were so excited when we discovered they had our toothbrush heads on amazon. They are the same brand we used to buy in the store just a couple dollars less online for 3 toothbrush heads instead of just the one we used to buy for the same price, which is fabulous! This product is superb because they last up to 4-5 months before having to change the head on the toothbrush. Plus they ship pretty fast. A win, win for this product!"
4,New view,"We brought it into our house and changed the old heads for the new ones. The colors were so much bolder , and the brush heads seemed to rotate to clean better."
5,Replacement brush heads.,I've had this electric toothbrush for quite a few years. It got where I couldn't find replacement brush heads. So I am very happy with these replacements.
3,Oral-B Sonic Replacement Brush Head,"It is working okay, but had a hard time getting the brush to fit on the shaft. I had to really push down on it, otherwise it has worked fine."
1,don't fit,These did not fit my oral B vitality toothbrush. I emailed the manufacturer and they insisted they did (and they don't!). Now i have three toothbrush heads that don't fit and am out my money. Frustrated and upset. Would never order from this company again.
1,Does not fit my vitality brush,"I was excited to find these on subscribe and save and the price was very reasonable in comparison to retail. The brush itself is a different size and shape than the smaller round heads I presently use, so that was another reason I was looking forward to using these. The cut out shape in the stem of the brush attachment is entirely different than that of the brush I have on there now, and so it does not snap onto the brush handle at all. I don't know if Oral B/Braun has changed the brush design since other reviewers' comments, so just beware that this refill will likely NOT fit your vitality sonic. Bummed :("
1,"Poor packaging, got bent brush heads",Got a brush head with bent heads. That may be the reason why the product is cheaper here than other stores.
3,Sonic oral b toothbrush heads,"I was glad to find these replacement heads as they are becoming increasingly scarce. They are impossible to find locally anymore.In addition they don't fit the oral B handle as well as the originals, they are probably meant as a one size fits all arrangement, which they don't. Hence the three stars rating.After these wear out I'll probably have to find a new toothbrush altogether."
5,great toothbrush head,these replacement heads work well for the Oral-B Sonic Toothbrush. The brushes last for a long time and hold up well.
5,terrific!,This documentary is exactly what it purports to be: a unique glimpse into Viet Nam at a point of time when it could not be farther removed from the American mind. Not only is it an terrific documentary in the best tradition of the genre and a just and unbiased piece of journalism. With the distance of 30 years it is by now a historical document in its own right portraying the country after the US left und the Republic of Vietnam (South) went down the tubes and the bustling country of today
3,A great first effort,"The first album from these guys only hints at what they can do. The songs are very well put together and really makes me anxious for the newest album, out soon I've been told! Hilites include the very funky, horn-driven ""Get Up"", the tender ""For You"" and the spacy ""I Wanna Know"". Good songs from a group that keeps getting better - check out their live show to see what I mean!"
1,Crappy Quality and No Voice!,There is something wrong with this video. You can only hear the music. The woman's lips (and hips) move but you cannot hear a word she is saying.
4,good cult flick,"This was a good film although a bit disturbing with the nature of the actors in the movie. I did enjoy the somewhat constant ""fear"" of the main character being caught and the loss of innocense."
3,intriguing absurdity,"The doom generation is one of those weird movies that wasn't the greatest but you aren't likely to forget. The violence in the film is actually not very graphic compared to the attitude twords violence. The charecters don't revel in violence like Alex in a Clockwork Orange, nor are they put off by it. They simply don't care. The only time they show remorse is when they accidentally run over a dog and then they are in tears. This movie is certainly strange and there is something of a message and I would reccomend it to those with off the wall tastes"
2,not without its merits,"Two positive points from ""The Doom Generation"": A) a cameo by Skinny Puppy; and B) the well-chosen techno soundtrack proves director Gregg Araki at least has good taste in music. The first time I saw this I was enthralled by its shock-all nature, but it didn't take very long for the effect to wear off...maybe I've just gotten older and I need at least a LITTLE morality, a little shred of plot to enjoy a movie of this nature. The castration climax is repulsive and well-done, but also seems out of place in relation to everything that's gone on before. ""The Doom Generation"" is for the under-20 crowd only; anyone else should check out ""SubUrbia,"" an equally plotless but far more intelligent film."
1,DOOM GENERATION - seen by a normal guy,"First of all I like Independent Movies, no, not the like of Independence Day or the Patriot. This movie is worth watching once in a lifetime, but if have just time in your life watching one indie flick, please choose Six String Samurai. I mean if you are a fan of Rose McGowan, or just want to see her naked, go for it, this your movie. Besides countless sex scenes this movie also offers very naughty violence. Some of it is really too much. I saw the DVD, the picture is in full screen, quite ok. The sound volume sometimes changes. Special features are spanish subtitles, the trailer and 3 additional trailers to other valuable Trimark movies. I baught it, now I am gonna sell it. If you are open minded, watch it.."
1,What a waste of time and money,If I could give this less stars I would. So horrible. I can't believe that anyone would like this movie. It's only purpose is to try and shock viewers. I read the reviews where people say it's a thinking persons movie. No it isn't. I get the message it was conveying (you'd have to be blind not to) but it's an example of pseudo-intellectualism. Watch Natural Born Killers instead.
1,non-pan and non-scan,"I found this DVD very difficult to watch - and not because of its violent content. The manufacturers have chosen not to present it in widescreen - fair enough - but their idea of pan-and-scan seems to be to point whatever it is they point at the middle of the frame and keep it there without moving, so a lot of dialogue comes from characters who are off the edges, and it's basically a matter of luck as to whether or not important action ends up in frame."
4,The banality of violence,"After seeing the Doom Generation, one may very well ask ""what was the point of that?"" All I can say, is that this movie relishes in the violence and depravity of modern urban life. There is no ""protagonist"" in this film, simply three young people consumed with the hedonism of the moment. The movie moves at a blistering pace, through episodes of sex, to scenes of viciousness so over the top, they are comic. The scene featuring a television news broadcast showing their viewers a talking, decapitated head, is so cynical it is hilarious.Films like these are about shattering icons, casting aside notions of abstract morality, and showing us the dark side of the world we live in. It's ""Leave it to Beaver"" in reverse."
3,"Arakki's ""straight"" movie","Movie follows three teens through a sex-, booze- and violence-filled road trip as they tear their self-destructive way through an urban America of strip malls and motels. Pluses: Three really attractive leads who do a fairly good job of being the naive stoner dude, femme fatale with a soft heart and the moody, handsome, sexually ambiguous drifter respectively. This is supposed to be Arakki's straight movie, so the guys have sex separately with the girl and the threesome, when it happens, does not end well. Negatives: I didn't think the movie was very coherent. There seemed to be a lot violence just for the sake of it, and Arakki's no Tarantino. You don't really relate to the lead characters as they don't seem to have a back story. If you are looking for a movie with a destructive yet sexy female lead wreaking havoc on those around her, I would suggest the much better ""the opposite of sex"", which at least had a lot of sympathetic characters and some resolution at the end..."
1,What if this film could be understood?,"I don't care what some of these people are saying, this is the WORST FILM EVER MADE! By the way, I am no religious nut; moreover, I ""understand"" film quite well, thank you. However, I prefer a wee bit of comprehension in my cinema."
1,a feast for psuedo intellectuals,"if you thought this movie was good, or art you are just very dumb. whatever you may think, trust me this movie is NOT good. you are very dumb for thinking otherwise."
5,Well someone finally had to come out with the truth....,"I just recently became a fan of these ""indie"" films..when I first rented this movie I told my friends it was like KIDS ( by Larry Clark if you wanna check it out) on crack! Oh boy they didn't disagree. For us, over-hormoned, oblivious, and vaugely understanding the burried message 15 yr olds, it was pretty cool! But honestly I couldn't dish out any gripping adjectives to you, to speak for the movie, let the other guys do it for ya. This movie captures the heart of our somber ""doom generation."" but trust me, it's not too depressing, leave it to the director to splash in some humor and maybe a little hope. but anyways get it! It's definitly worth popping in the video, sitting down on the couch and trying to make sense of whatever message Araki's making...oh and what's with everyone thinking they know that lovable character Amy Blue too?"
1,Can I give it ZERO stars,"movie sucked, plain and simple.Kaboom sucked as well.Folks can form their own opinion after watching it but I would give this and Kaboom Negative stars if I could.I almost feel the director should pay me for wasting time watching his junk."
4,A bit gay??,Hot hot Rose McGowan is the reason i had purchased this film. Of course she has lots of sex in it and you get to see her nice young naked body.................that is NOT what caught my eye. Lots of rampaging and murder and then her boyfriend and the other guy that is sharing her might do some close scenes together that seem just a little bit gay?
3,Satire to the extreme / black comedy,"Gregg Araki's Gen X film often to satirical at times. The movie is a road romp staring a very young Rose McGowan at the time as a spoiled teenage girl her soft spoken boyfriend and a crazy drifter. Basically they embark on an odyssey of sex, violence, and drugs after Mr Drifter shoots a convenience store clerk. They encounter all these eccentric characters along the way on a road to nowhere. Rose McGowan is quite funny at times & any movie with a cameo by Perry Farrell (Janes Addiction) is a must see at least once. A lacking script and too much satire/exaggeration but the movie obviously wasn't made to be philosophical, it will make you laugh. A black comedy about the careless/adventurous side of youth."
1,Embarassing,"It's almost bad to the point of being funny.It's almost a parody of indie movies. Actors staring into space saying lines like ""life is boring"". Shots into the windshield of a car while the vixen in black sunglasses dives through the desert. Shallow one-dimensional bad guys, even shallower nihilistic bisexual club kids..It has it all. Perhaps if I was 20 years old, went to art school, and did a lot of X I'd find it amazing.I'm tacking on a star just for the beauty of the actors/actresses, and the general style of the film. Everyone did look super cool. It's like an issue of Raygun magazine come to life."
1,Pathetic,"The Doom Generation (directed and written by Gregg Araki) is as close to worthless a film as I have seen. Utterly unredeemable and only marked with outrageous visual perversion to break up the boredom. Mr. Araki certainly suffers from a sickness of the soul and his ""New Queer"" filmmaking is destined for the dustbin of history."
3,Bizarre,"This is a low-budget take on ""Natural Born Killers"", ""Strange Days"" and ""The Salton Sea"". It is so ""weird"" you will either love it, or hate it. I felt both as I watched it. It's a must see for this genre'. I'm just not sure if I'll watch it more than twice. Maybe you shoudl rent it first."
1,Boring,"I never fall asleep on a movie before. I have more talent than the director of this boring and rabid film. Its laking originality, direction, actors, craft... and so on... I must go now... It makes me sleepy just thinking about it..."
1,A Self-Indulgent Mess,"Like the cast itself, this movie is so self-conscious and surface-obsessed, that it fails to impart anything meaningful or memorable. Even the ""big ending"" is horrifying in attempts to be humorous and vice versa. In short, utterly exhausting. In fairness, Araki's ""The Living End"" is much more honest and engaging."
1,This movie is doomed,"If you like bad dialogue, bad acting, and bad directing, then this is the film for you. The characters are brainless and annoying. The plot is pointless and unfocused. I didn't care what happened to anyone in this film. I only watched it to the end because I had nothing else to do. Even the appearance of Parker Posey could not save this film."
5,romping-stomping awesome crazy!,"This movie is one of the most messed-up, but at the same time, kickin' movies of all time. Its disturbing but so funny, and is filled with more action and drama than you could ever imagine! A running theme of 666 is pretty clever and the checkered room rules!"
1,i hate this movie,"There's a Village People movie on TV right now, starring Steve Guttenberg. I own the Doom Generation on VHS. I'm watching the Village People movie anyway. What does that tell you?Six Dollars and Sixty-Six cents. Please pay now."
1,DON'T WATCH THIS,This is on my short list of movies never to see. It is not only horrible; it is disturbing. It will bother you. You will wish you never saw it. Also on the list: U Turn
4,Beyond Neo-Noir: For the Decadent Imagination,"The Doom Generation is Araki's best film to date. Rose McGowan is interestingly cast as Amie Blue, the femme fatale for the 90's. She embarks upon a doomsday journey with her counterparts Xavier Red and Jordan White. As in Kafka's The Trial, everyone seems to be after Amie, but she doesn't know why. Darkly remniscant of Godard's Weekend, The Doom Generation makes an important statement about groupthink and mass conformity. It addresses teen angst in a post-Cobain desolate American setting. Underlying the maudlin comedy are serious issues, such as bigotry, androgyny, and a longing for acceptance is a world devoid of humanity."
5,Wow,"Clumsy performances and dialogue (ala Clerks) only fuel the satire and poignancy of this wonderful piece. The images throughout the film are visually absurd but perfect! This one isn't for the faint of heart and may leave a bitter taste in the viewer's mouth afterwards but a definite must see. My only criticism was in regards to the dvd which was not presented in widescreen(bummer!) This movie is biting, sexy, funny, sweet and scary all at the same time."
2,Fake art,"Don't judge a film by the bands on its soundtrack. Doom Generation includes songs by early-90's art-rock giants like Lush, Cocteau Twins and Jesus and Mary Chain, but the film has little else to recommend it. Boring, arch and unfunny, it's the sort of movie you might keep watching because you think it HAS to get better. It doesn't. I'm a big fan of subversive cinema, and this aint it.The 3 principal actors give fine performances, considering the godawful material. The DVD edition contains no bonus material, is not widescreen; sound and image quality are comparable to VHS."
5,sex drugs and rock,"1 good,2 exciting,3 beautiful,4 supense,5 erotic,6 painful,7 angst,8 young,9 hot,10 visual candy.what else can i say? really this is too long."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"There is some decent acting in this movie but aside from that, it's complete garbage. I hate it all the more for trying so hard to be hip and in-your-face. It almost dares you to hate it if only to cover up for its consistent lack of quality. I don't hate this movie because it's shocking, I hate it because it thinks it's so shocking."
1,Really Boring. Dont waste your money,"The most boring movie I've ever seen. Enough has been said around here. Dont waste your time or money. Supposed to be shocking. It isn't, its just plain."
3,The weakest of the Teen Angst Trilogy by Araki,"This is the second part in Araki's ""Teen Angst Trilogy"", and by far the least watchable. Check out ""Totally F***ed Up"" and ""Nowhere"" for a better time."
1,Dooming review...,"Doom Generation is a blank. If you watch it, you will be wasting time and money. Natural Born Killers is much better in every category than this flop, which is one of the worst films I have ever seen. 666 repeated? Head flying off? Shearing body parts? Yes, all here. Unfortunately, this movie has pathetic characters, dialogue, and script. It's too bad that people as talentless as this director get to make movies while skilled directors like Sean Penn have to struggle to direct movies. This movie is pitiful in every sense of the word. If you watch this movie, you will never forgive yourself...you may even lose brain cells in the course of the experience. I would give this negative stars, but, unfortunately, that was not an option.If you want violence done in a psychedelic way, watch Natural Born Killers. Better yet watch A Clockwork Orange. Ultimately, my advice is this: Consider jumping in the shark tank at the zoo before you consider watching this horrible excuse for a movie."
1,THIS MOVIS IS HORRIBLE,"i love indie movies, but this ... i cant even describe it.... I felt 100 times dumber after watching it!"
1,Worked for about a week,"We took this out of the packaging and it worked great the first time. I loved the clear readout. After that, it stopped working and just displayed ""L"" within a few months. I don't recommend this product."
4,Works just like the black one.,I purchased this for my sister. Appears to be the exact same thing as the black one except in hot pink. It works great and gives very accurate pressure readings. Long term power and relibility remain to be seen.
1,Excellent for draining air out of bike tires,Within 5 seconds it can drain all the air out of a bicycle tire. It then accurately reads 0 lbs pressure. That was the only reading that I was able to get from it.
3,no other colors,"i think that it is an AWESOME bag. my favorite color is purple, and i got really excited when i saw that they made it in purple. When i tried to order it, it wouldnt let me pick my color. it only had the colors navy, red, royal and black. it got me really mad, but i really do like the bag in red too. i just really want it in purple."
3,"Could have been better, but still worth the time!","A lot of people think Part 2 is more in vein with Part 1 and also better than Part 3. That couldn't be further from the truth. Although I do enjoy Part 2, it's more like a Freddy Krueger movie with comdey and campy moments meant for audiences who don't really take the B-movie genre seriously. However, there are some great creepy moments, some good characters (and that sais a lot!) and awsome special effects. Better than average sequel, but not as good as Part 3."
3,Another enjoyable movie!,"Normally I don't like sequels better than the original, but this one I like better! Probably because there's more happening in this one, but less humour. Amelia Kinkade returns to her role as Angela. Christine Taylor is one of the cast members in this movie, whom I remembered her as Marcia in ""The Brady Bunch Movie."" Better acted than the original with alot of music scores and more effects."
2,Not as good as the 1st,"I really enjoyed the 1st one but this one just seemed flat. It used a lot of leftover scenes from the 1st movie, ""Angela"" floating in the halls, to name one thing. I guess the religion thing kind of made this movie less desirable. It had potential, but it couldn't quite do what the first movie did. It didn't really create that Halloween ambiance like the first, the house didn't seem as creepy to me, and the kills were a bit BLAH. It's not a bad movie but...the first is better and why in the world this one is MORE EXPENSIVE is beyond me. It's worth adding to your horror collection if you can pick it up for like 5.00-8.00 or something, maybe. I'm more of a zombie fan anyhoo, not a demon/ghost movie type person. I guess I thought since the first was really good that this would be too, wrong."
4,This has a MORBID ANGEL song on the soundtrack...,"That's not why I like it though, just wanted to mention it."
1,Horrible,"I saw the first one a long time ago and it was excellent. Sometime later I found the second one and thought 'Hey cool' ha what a joke. After watching that I wanted to cry, it had made a complete mockery of the first one and although I did like a couple parts, mostly it ... . The house in the beginning was ... because instead of a wall they had a picket fence! Man if there was a picket fence the first one would have had just a few less casualties. Anyway, if you liked the first one don't bother seeing it, it's not the kind of thing I'd want to submit really anyone to. Well, hope I was helpful."
4,friend was scared,"my friend was sooo sared of this movie that she had to cover her eyes threw hl\alf of it. it wasnt scary, it just had lotz of s\demons in this frieky house that was a party. it was ok but i thoguht it was kinda dumb, my friend made such a big deal about it!!!!!"
2,PROOF THAT SEQUELS DO IN FACT SUCK!,"AFTER VIEWING THE ORIGINAL, I IMMEDIATELY RUSHED TO THE STORE TO RENT THE SECOND. BOY WAS I DISSAPOINTED. THE MOVIE BASICALLY TAKED ALL THE GREAT ELEMENTS OF THE FIRST AND CRUSHED THEM. THE PLOT IS HORRIBLE, SO IS THE ACTING, AND THE NUN REALLY AND I MEAN REALLY DESTROYS THE MOVIE! ANOTHER THING THAT SET THIS ONE APART FROM THE ORIGINAL, WAS THE EXCESSIVE USE OF T&A. NOT THAT THAT'S A BAD THING, BUT IT WAS PRETTY EXCESSIVE. ANYWAY, THIS MOVIE IS FAR LESS SUPERIOR TO THE ORINAL, AS MOST MOVIES ARE. SKIP THIS ONE, UNLESS YOU ARE A TRUE FAN TO THE ORIGINAL. BUT EVEN THEN, YOU'LL STILL BE DISSAPOINTED! RATED R FOR:VIOLENCE-GORE, A TON OF SEX/NUDITY, AND LANGUAGE."
3,"""Your Faith is a joke.""","If you enjoyed the first film then you'll like this one too. There's nothing original going on, just more teens vs. Angela, but there's some cheesy ELM STREET-style humor, attractive early-90's girls (including the future Mrs. Ben Stiller), demon possession violence and a Morbid Angel song. Definitely worth a rent."
4,It will scare the hell out of you -again!!!,This movie was a little corny than the first.It was about teenagers from st. rita's acadamy that want to throw a party at hull house.Among the teenageers is Angela's sister Milissa(mouse) and wierd things start happening so the teens leave thinking they were safe.Boy were they wrong.One teen brought back lipstick from the house and relised Angela!!!!At a church dance Angela unleashes evil.So a nun a priest and the surviving teens must face Angela and her demon buddies at hull house!!!!This movie had a lot more nudity than the first and It will scare the hell out of you!!!!!!!!!
2,Not As Good As The Original!,"You know what they say - the sequels always suck, and in this case, that is correct. The first one was awesome, the second one sucked, and the third demons installment really bites the dust...hard! Don't be fooled by the box cover - it looks like it's going to be really good; and possibly even better then the first, but it really sucked! The first one was and IS the best out of the three ""Demons"" movies. This movie brought in a REALLY STUPID character (the nun), which ruins the whole damn movie. You should rent this movie first before you buy it. I don't suggest you even rent the third one at all..."
4,FUNNY AS SHIOT,"When I first saw this movie I was skeptical. I think it is a corney horror movie, but it is extremely funny. The nun has some of the best one-liners in any movie I've seen. ""Leave a little room for the Holy Ghost."" When she suits up like Rambo I almost peed myself, and the part with the Holy Water balloons and oozies cracks me up! The girl that plays Mouse is hilarious ""My name is not mouse, it's Melissa!"" Get this movie and you will laugh yourself so hard you will have to watch it again and again. (Isn't it amazing how the jumpkick guy kicks the wood in the end so perfectly that it forms a cross?)"
1,Help,I dint received the package i went to the post office and everything but nothing can you please message me back or something i don't wanna loose my money and not get the item in my hands
3,Night of the demon,"The film was not as good as I thought it mite be , the demon effects were to unoriginal this was a film I did not greatly like"
3,AN OK SEQUEL,night of the demons 2 was an o.k sequel! it explained exactly what happened after the first movie! it had alot of funny scenes and supernun fights! and of course the main demon angela was floating around everywhere taking souls to hell with her!
3,novscorp,"I saw the movie on Television, about 2 months ago, Kinda weird and funny looking, but it had scary characters, Its a good movie."
2,Must All Good Things Be Ruined?,"I loved the first Night of the Demons,I expected cheese and what I got was a scary and memorable movie.This movie ruined everything the first one was.This is basically something I hate,Freddy Krugerish horror/comedy.Angela was truly a terrifying and eerie horror villain.So much more frightening than all the cliche,big money,overly comical,80's horror franchise villains like Freddy.But in Night of the Demons 2 she did not maintain her aura of evil and gloom she started having one liners and jokes and all the things that ruin good horror villains.Then you have the plot!Oh no what a joke.Okay you get a nun in love with firearms and a school dance and the throwing of holy water balloons.I could go on and on.Basically if you take horror seriously you will hate this movie like me but if you are not looking for any real or dark horror and want a little bit of fun on the weekend you may like this."
3,TRUE TO THE FIRST IN EVERY WAY!,"i loved this installment. Its just as good as the first one. The gun-happy nun was an unpredictable killing machine and the rest of the movie was just unexpected gory fun. Still, the 3rd film in the series really ruined the first 2...But I dont really care. Its still the first 2 that made horror so fun....Other then the Evil Dead films, Night Of The Demons 1 and 2 are just as fun as any comedy/horror film. Great gory fun is all it is."
4,Angela's newest party is to welcome her sister home!!,"If you remember Angela's last party, and how could you forget, this is a can't miss!! Her sister comes home, so family and friends all gather to warm themselves in the fire. It's a gorry, macabre family reunion on Halloween, with plenty of friends and classmates to shed limbs for the happy sisters!!"
3,If you liked the first NOD then youll like this one,"If you liked the first night of the demons then you should like this one.it delivers the same kind of thrills and chills the first one did.theres plenty of blood and gore to be enjoyed for horror fans.this is one to watch on holloween or just when your in the mood for creepy horror.watch this one after you see the first one,itll make more sense this way to the veiwer.worth adding to your dvd collection if you collect horror like i do."
5,Love it,"Looks nice on house , ordered leg kit but did not need. Quality looking product. Great great great great great the end"
5,Good stuff - prolongs razor blades.,"I have no idea how this blade oil compares to any other blade oils. However, I can tell you that this blade oil does exactly what it is meant to do. I have a very basic Conair hair-cut razor set. The first set of blades wore out in about a year. You can tell, because they will leave a bunch of hairs long. It will just not cut quite the same. I bought replacement blades along with the oil. The blades are sharp and cutting great in the same amount of time. I just make sure to oil the blades after each use. Buy this to ensure your razor blades last!!"
5,Essential,If you use clippers hard like I do then you need this. This bottle is huge and will probably last both my Wahl clippers for a decade.
3,Messy,"It is a needed product, but I found it messy and difficult to use. Not sure how it could be different. Just be sure to pit a towel down before using so you don't get drips everywhere."
5,WORKS GREAT!,"WORKS GREAT! Three different sets of clippers in my house, used about once a week by the guys, and this oil is a life saver. After a while clippers would start to pull/grab. And the itty bitty bottle of oil that comes with the clippers is gone before you know it, mainly because it usually leaks after you open it. This bottle doesn't leak and lasts a long time. The price is great and I have yet to see this in any drug store by me. Just put a few drops on the blades before each use and you get an easy and pain free haircut."
5,"Excellent product, excellent customer service","Fast and professional service, very pleased with the product. Received item as described, no place can beat the value paid for the product."
4,Keeps the blades sharp,"I do not shave my face in the traditional fashion. I use a beard and mustache trimmer without a guard. So my trimmers take a good amount of abuse since I use them every morning. This oil keeps the blades sharp and the mechanism smooth so that my skin doesn't get sheared off and it isn't pulling hair out of my face. This bottle will probably last me until the end of time, but your mileage may vary if you use it for professionals purposes or you are a wolf-person.PROS-It worksCONS-None"
5,Just what it is.,I cut my own hair and this keeps the blades sharper and from pulling longer. It is worth the money for the upkeep of your clippers!
2,Nothing Special,"Certainly does't seem to perform any better than any other oil I have tried in the past! As a name brand product I expected more from this product, the only thing I got was a second bottle added to my order that I don't want or ask for!"
4,"What can I say, it's oil","Bought it when I purchased a Wahl cordless hair clipper, so not much to say about what it does. It's just oil, but it seems to work fine."
5,An Eternity of Oil,"The shavers and trimmers I've bought have all come with a thin, eyedropper sized container of oil.They've all leaked and are easy to lose. Considering that one only adds a couple drops of oil to blades and trim heads on occasion, this generously sized bottle of oil should last a lifetime.The oil dispenses neatly from the container and is easy to control. Just twist the top to open and twist again to seal the deal.I use this oil on my two shavers and my hair and beard trimmers with no problems. Regular oiling keeps the appliances working well and the blades sharp."
5,Great stuff,"This works great with my Wahl clippers, and is very reasonably priced for the generous 4 ounce bottle. It should last me quite a while."
3,So far...,I haven't used it yet. I'll probably use it on the new shaver I'm going to buy to replace the Remington.
3,Necessary when you have a clipper,Good oil and decent consistency to clean and maintain the blades. Applicator can be improved to force the oil between the blades.
4,"It's clipper oil, much like (if not identical to) what comes with the clippers.","Be aware of the size of this. What comes with the clippers is a few milliliters... this a FOUR OUNCES (118ml)Provided I don't lose it, I'm probably set on clipper oil for the remainder of my life."
3,oil is oil,The oily blade catches the hair or maybe the hare-if you are cutting rabbit fur--what can you say that is exciting about clipper oil?
5,A Must for Educators,The groundwork set by this book is a great asset to anyone in the process of becoming and educator or is already there. It is a definite must read.
4,Could be better,"I bought this wrench after briefly owning a Harbor Frieght knockoff of an IR 231. The HF worked for everything I tried it on except the crankshaft pulley bolt on my Camry. I had a shop loosen the bolt with their Mac Tools wrench, then decided to return the HF. I later bought this wrench, expecting better performance than the HF, but it seems about the same. It failed to remove the bolts for the front exhaust pipe on the Camry. I had to remove them with a breaker bar, and was surprised that they weren't on that tight, maybe 90-100 lb-ft or so. The IR wrench should have spun them off. Compressor pumps 5.6 cfm at 90 psi, which is supposed to be enough. This IR has worked fine for wheel lugs and other miscellaneous nuts and bolts; I just haven't been able to see any noticible difference over the HF."
4,Good lightweight gun,"I hoped this gun would be stronger than it is, but it is about on par with my 18 year old Craftsman impact. Still it is nice and warmer on the hands in the cold weather than my old chrome plated gun."
1,Junk,"I am very disappointed with this tool. It works hard just to take off medium-torque lug nuts. It could barely break loose a ball joint on my Dakota using an impact-driven ball-joint separator. This is marketed as a ""heavy duty"" impact wrench?!? What a joke! If I ever have a son I will let him use this to work on his tricycle but otherwise this is not fit for work in ANY kind of garage. The 550 ft-lb rating is only in reverse. It can only tighten to 350 ft lbs. I am very doubtful of those figures. It sems to apply the same amount of torque as my 20 year-old rockwell I bought at a garage sale for $5. Also, the manual states that to achieve the full torque output, you need 22 CFMs from your air compressor. I'm not going to go buy a $3000 compressor just to run this piece of crap."
4,Good air impact,"I like the impact gun, could use more power. Should of went with a more power gun, but with the price of this on Amazon I decided to go with this one. Nothing wrong with this will work fine for most homeowners, but if you use this in a small business you need to go with a higher impact duty gun."
5,Works Great!,Decently priced and hasn't let me down yet. I used it for working on my cars. IR is a trusted brand as I use their equipment offshore in way harsher conditions so I definitely felt confident purchasing this.
5,Couldn't be more pleased,"I've been sitting on the fence for years, reluctant to ""pony-up"" and buy one of these tools. Mostly because I've used some of the AutoZone and Walmart varieties and have ended up returning them due to insufficient power. When I decided to tackle my '94 300ZX timing belt, I figured that I didn't need a fancy tool to break a single crankshaft bolt loose, right?! Every time I applied pressure to the breaker bar, every cam and valve notch would pull out of line. Frustrated, I scoured the internet looking for ""sweet-spot"" in price vs. power and after hours of looking, found this Ingersoll-Rand for what I'm certain was a very good price. Once I got this dude connected to my compressor and the pressure dialed in, it made the job almost too easy. Now I've been looking for anything else with a lug or a bolt that I can use it on and it has worked like a charm every time. I really enjoy being able to change the three torque settings with the flip of a switch."
2,To week,Was not strong enough to remove lugs from my truck.returned it. cant say that i would recommend it to any one
4,best for the price,"While this impact is on the lower end of the scale, it's super strong and worth every penny. Amazon's super saving shipping (free) to Hawaii is just what we need here. Guarantee I'll be shopping more at Amazon."
4,When I say no....,Although I have been trying to be more assertive over the past couple of years it was not until I read this book that I knew what things I did made me come off as a push-over and what made me strong. Now I am able to transition into a more equal role with those around me when the situation changes.Its a great read
3,Get a little backbone,The books was interesting but difficult to practice on my own. I worked with a therapist to do that. The basic concepts helped me figure out how to handle those times that I want to say no but feel uncomfortable doing so. It's helped me quite a bit.
2,I Feel Guilty?,"""When I Say No, I Feel Guilty"" is out of date. It was a good analysis of low self-esteem and low sense of assertiveness when it was written over 3 decades ago but times change and some new scenarios are in order. Vocabulary also changes and some of the language is archaic. As a tool for a psychologist to recommend to a patient, it is appropriate, but there is surely something more recent on the market."
4,Great introduction to assertiveness and fending off manipulaton,"A very quick read, dense with usable info and applicable real life scenarios. Not the most well written piece of literature, but gets the message across!"
5,"When I say No, I feel Guilty","The most concise, direct, and organized way to learn assertiveness. Anyone can use the book to learn the techniques by practicing the dialogues with a friend, and then using them in real life situations. If anyone disagrees, well . . .""I'm sure you feel that way!"""
5,Wonderful!,"I think thinking books like this would be burned by politicians and salesmen who don't want the public to be able to think for themselves. In philosophy, we use talk about the same things in psychology, except our names are a little different.This book helps me not feel guilty when I tell my boss I can't cover for someoneone or not even interested in buying something from a salesman. Many of those types of people: employers, employees, family members, businessmen and politicians use overgeneralizations and false arguments to manipulate you. Just be aware! This book will help you sharpen your skills to be able to spot those kinds of people out."
3,Why we are easily manipulated by others,"This book is a bit outdated in style and stories, but the content is as applicable as ever. From the first reading of only a few pages, I was able to start seeing my interactions in a different way. What I enjoy about this book is that it explains that we all learn how to manipulate to get what we want, and that realizing this puts no one at fault.This knowledge can empower us to take more responsibility for our interactions and our life as awareness is the first step. Secondly, the tools it outlines are really a new way of thinking and viewing the world. Since we try to manipulate others also, the third step is knowing how to influence our world without manipulating others.Very enjoyable empowering my life through reading this book."
3,Mixed,"Its was middle of the road book for me, if somebody had some real assertive issues then I fully recommended it - not that I didn't learn something - the section on persistence and the section reading between the lines or the dropping of information."
4,Thank you!,The book was delivered in a timely manner. The book was in the condition that was advertised. Thank you!
2,A Mike Hammer Book for Getting What You Want...,"...and watch out for those side effects. First of all, this book is not what it claims. Assertiveness Training is not used here as it is in behavior therapy. The father of behavior therapy is/was Joseph Wolpe. To Wolpe, relaxation inhibits fear. Anger and intimacy inhibit social fear. But Wolpe stated that these books were not operating within this framework. Assertiveness training, according to Wolpe, was based on anger and intimacy in order to inhibit social anxiety. Not a textbook on manipulation and aggression. The only Assertiveness training book that Wolpe approved of and liked was ""Your Perfect Right"" by Alberti and Emmons (yes, you can order a copy from ...). Alberti and Emmons also condemned this book for being highly manipulative. And it is!"

1,"When I Say No, I Feel Guilty","The title of this book should really reflect the content, which is purely ""how to be more assertive"". It does not necessarily have anything to do with feeling guilty about saying NO. I felt the title was misleading and would not reccomend this book to someone who is looking for true help with saying NO."
5,royo,"I am a huge royo fan and this is one of my favorite of his books, it focuses on female warriors."
4,elevated dog bowl,"Item is not as sturdy as it appears. Stainless bowls are also fairly thin. For the price however, it has a nice appearance."
2,Disappointed,"Like another reviewer posted, the legs are not even and the set wobbles. The bowls also shift significantly in their respective ""holders"", which clatters and moves around a lot when my dog tries to eat his food. I have to mix a small amount of wet food in with his dry food (to give him medicine) and he refuses to lick the wet food from the bottom (where all his medicine is!!) because of how much the whole set wobbles and clatters. :("
5,LOVE IT,Great size for our little beagle! So cute and decorative (not just an ugly old dog bowl). LOVE IT!
3,ehh...,"I purchased this from Amazon in an effort to get a dish my dog could not push around the kitchen while she's eating. I love the design and am pretty satisfied with my purchase, but it is small and light, so Stella still pushes it around the kitchen when she eats."
2,2 Qt,Its cute but I'm kind of dissapointed. Its really small. I'm thinking about returning it... Its really cute but I don't think it was worth the $27.88 I paid for it.
5,wonderful for big dogs,i sent this home for a xmas present for our family dog. It looks wonderful in the house since it does not look like a regular dog dish .
5,Like the looks as well as functional !,"I probably orderd a bit too large of dishes but this is well made, does not topple over with my sheltie eating or drinking out of it and it just the right size height wise for my little guy. I do think raised feeders are a better way for dogs to eat and digest their food better. Very pretty and I keep mine in the kitchen. I only wish the sturdy stainless was a ceramic made bowl instead,but I was aware they were stainless steel when I ordered this set. Like I said, this is a well-made feeder and I do like it a lot..functional as well as a nice set to have in the kitchen."
5,My Sheltie Loves Her Food Bowls!,"My new sheltie puppy who is five months (and approximately 13 inches high - her shoulder blade height) old loves her food bowls. I love the fact that she doesn't have to bend down to eat her food. It is a nice looking set and it is better than having the bowls directly on the floor. Even though I give this a five star rating, one of the legs came in a little ""off"" and the bowl holder wouldn't stay in place. My hubby fixed it and it works beautifully. I am going to add pictures to show the use of the bowls! I recommend this product for any dog owner who wants to have their dogs enjoy their food in a ""good posture"" and want something that is nice to have around the house."
5,Nice looking and functional feeder for large dog,"We have a large lab mix who is a rambunctious eater so I was hoping for something she couldn't tip over and something that wouldn't show slobber and other dirt easily - BINGO! I got exactly what I was looking for - the bowls are easy to clean and the stand itself doesn't tip or show dirt. It was easy to put together because the four legs just insert - no tools, no force. And it stands up to my 80 pound dog without tipping or spilling. We use both bowls for food - keeps her searching back and forth between the two just in case she missed a piece. This set is the perfect size for feeding. If you have a less energetic eater you could probably get away with one bowl for food and one for water although you would probably need another water bowl or you'll be refilling this one more frequently."
3,I like it... my dog doesn't.,"The bowls and stand are perfect for my 65lb pitbull. He loved the bowls for the first month until the tags on this collar got stuck in the swirly metal design and he is now scared to go near the bowls & stand. He was a rescue and is very skittish. Again, the bowls and stand are great.... I just never imagined he would get stuck on the metal stand though :-("
5,Very nice bowl set,This set is great! It prevents the water bowl from being sloshed around and the dog from chasing the food dish across the floor while she's eating. Everything stays in one place and at a more comfortable height for medium and larger dogs. It is also very attractive and the bowls are sturdy and easy to clean. I would buy this again.
4,Decent,"I read a lot of reviews so I knew what to expect. The legs did just fall out, but a little stretching of them before insertion was all it took to keep them in place. It does wobble a bit, but not too much and easily fixable with a little felt pad. I was very unsure of the size I needed. The 1-Quart seemed litke it was going to be too small, but I did not want a huge dish for our MIni Golden Doodle. This is perfect. She is still a puppy right now, but this dish will easily hold the two cups of food that she will be fed as an adult. I did not put the legs on for the first month that we had her because it was a bit high and she would hit her collar on the metal bowl and get scared. She is a bit larger now and no longer afraid if it makes any noise. The transition to the legs was seemless."
1,"Ethical Mediterranean Double Diner, 1 Qt","Tried to return this item to upgrade and pay more for the IRIS feeder. Way too small, and the picture shownfor the diminsions for this product were obscured. Too tippy, and really not even a good product for a smaller dog. As I returned this item, some how, I received another one..the same one 2 days later, so...I had to return it twice for atotal refund. Very frustrating!"
4,good price for a fancy design,my dog took awhile to get used to it (she is very sensitive to new things like this) but we like it a lot and she is coming to like them as well
5,Great value,"Bought two of these for our dogs, and they are working great, good quality, and it came with two metal bowls, which we didn't realize. Our dogs are both 50 pounders, so we bought the 2qt size."
4,Great price,"I just bought this and love it. I like that it matches my Decor and the Cats seem to like it too which is the main thing. It's also easy to clean. My other water and food bowls were bulky and a pain to wash so this is nice for a change.I rate this item 4/5 stars simply because the larger bowl sizes don't come with a taller frame. I love having the choice of bowl sizes, and this item has definitely relieved me of having to refill the dog water bowl every 30 minutes, but I feel it's a bit short for her size and she's only going to grow bigger. Still a solid product for the price, however."
5,beautiful dish,"I love this dish. it looks awesome. I have a doberman, and I bought a quart size dish and its too small. Will be exchanging for a larger one. A very nice product, just as pictured"
3,Disappointed...,"I ordered these as an interim solution to growing puppies. These are much smaller than I expected. The base requires assembly. This set, however, was not created even. When I set it up, it wobbled. So, I switched the legs to the other sides; same results. The wobbling causes the water to spill easily. It's very easy for the pups to push around. That's not what I was looking for. The bigger set might be more sturdy. This set would be good for someone who has a small dog that isn't very strong."
5,elevated diner bowls,"I purchased this item for my new puppy. Its a bit large for a puppy, but I know he will grow into it. For the price, it is a great value. The stainless steel bowls are durable and easy to clean. The legs on the scroll stand are removable, so I started out using it without the legs until my puppy grew a little bit. The item looks elegant, much nicer than the standard plastic bowls I've used in the past. Great value."
5,Excellent value,"This pet dish set is wonderful, I love it and our Siberian Husky loves it.The metal framework is very well made as well as being stylish and ornate. So much nicer than the average ugly, boring plastic dishes!! The stand literally took seconds to put together and it's solid, steady. Because of the design, it's very easy to vacuum around, no more sloshing water on the floor to sweep or vacuum! This is one set of dishes that my ""pushy"" dog can't slide all over the floor while eating and due to the raised height, he no longer has to lay on the floor to eat comfortably. I was worried the bowls would be thin and flimsy but they are just as solid and sturdy as the stand and they clean easily. This pet dish set is an excellent value, a top notch product for a fantastic price and I highly recommend it."
5,"really cute, a nice height","EAsy to assemble, and turned out to be the perfect height for myEnglish Cocker. looks pretty nice too."
4,"great product. late delivery, maybe Post offices fault. Faster communication.","Good product. Legs do not stay in base when you pick it up to clean behind it,etc. Otherwise, exactly what I needed."
5,Great,I love this bowl set. It's nice to look at and I like having my cat's food and water off the ground. Easy to clean under and has held up just fine--I've had it about 10 months now.
5,Quality Item,This is definitely a good buy. The price is lower and the quality is much better than the one Petsmart is selling. My pets and I are very pleased with this purchase.
3,Item Mis-represented,"I purchased this copy of Poems of Childhood by Eugene Field because it said that it was illustrated by Maxfield Parrish. Even the picture of the book cover here features an image of a Maxfield Parrish painting. While I am happy to have my own copy of the poems finally, I am quite disappointed that it does not include the images that were implied to be included in the book. This company got my business because their item for sale was mis-represented in its presentation online. It's not clear to me if this was because of how the company or Amazon advertised the item.~ Renee"
5,She's outdone herself again!,"I love Maggie's music and this is no exception. When I bought ""What Kind of Love"" I was expecting another lyrical masterpiece like ""Falling Forward"", but was pleasantly surprised with this side of Maggie. She lets up on her passionate love for God (similar to ""Testify"") and I love it. Then when you think the album is over along comes the shocking ""Poor in Paradise"". It almost belongs on another CD with its haunting melody. Some of my other favorites are ""Feel it All"", ""I Won't Be Persuaded"", and ""All That's Left"". Her guitar is not as evident on this CD, but the string arrangements are worth the sacrifice. This CD is incredible."
1,"pointless, really","dispite some fairly creative [by american standards] arrangements behind these flimsy, watery pop songs, the whole enterprise is pointless. an entire album of songs concerning becoming 'born again' that never has the courage to actually mention Jesus by name. kinda like a porn film with no c**-shots."
2,??? It's not a Motorola charger.,"This is a vehicle power charger FOR a Motorola V170, V171 phone, but it's not a Motorola product. More importantly, the charging tip is different from the real thing. This charger has one charging zone of 6.3 volts whereas the Motorola charger has a two zone tip that delivers 2.6 volts in one zone and 6.3 volts in the other. The socket in the V170 is made for two seperate circuits which seem to need different voltages. This charger fits into the socket, but delivers the same voltage to both circuits in the phone. Does it work? I'm not going to risk trying it."
3,First numbered Next Generation Novel.,Ghost Ship brings us the first of the Star Trek The Next Generation novels written for Pocket Books. This is a fairly original story involving Picard and crew in a multi-century mystery.A good read for any Star Trek fan.
1,Weak but good to see,"I bought this book when it first came out years ago. I read it, but honestly was not impressed. The characters seem wrong somehow. The story is lame. The overall plot wasn't something I cared about. However, it was a fine first attempt of a novel. I am glad it happened, so we can have more and better novels to enjoy."
1,The epitome of everything bad in the Next Generation,"The Next Generation was such an excellent series that it's hard to believe that one book could focus almost entirely on the goofy parts of the series.The book turns all of the crew into naval gazers, but my ""favorite"" part was the fake prime directive debate that consumed an entire chapter. What if we hurt the enemy's feelings?I still can't believe I read the whole book. This book was like a movie that I wish I'd walked out of.Thankfully, the series quickly abandoned the ""Romulan warbird de-cloaking off the port bow; shields down to 5% -- OK, everyone to the conference room to figure out what to do"" problem. But this book is the epitome of everything that could have gone wrong with the series. Thankfully, there's never been a book this bad again!"
1,Wesley tightened his young eyes......OOOH PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is maybe only good for a laugh i.e. ""Picard eyed him foxily"" Hmmmm? ""Worf puckered his lips in a Klingon kind of shrug"" What the heck is that supposed to mean! ""Her faint Greek accent tapped the words out with the clip of a sparrow's talons hopping across marble."" Whatever happened to ""she said.."" Don't get me wrong I do enjoy reading Star Trek TNG but I could not even finish this joke of all books. Thank you for your time."
5,Very Nice,Bought to replace similar set that was lost. This set is very well crafted and is very similar to the set my wife bought in Arizona.
4,"Great pictures, easy to use, awful battery life","This is a neat little camera. You can zoom, take different resolution pictures, take pics of yourself, and even make short movies. The LCD screen is not bad, but it contributes to the main fault of this camera which is the battery life. Regular alkaline batteries last for 10 - 20 pictures tops...less if you use the flash or use the LCD for a long time."
4,Takes great pictures,"This is my first digital camera. I love the large LCD and the ability to delete any pix I don't want. I took some pix inside and the camera illuminated the pix nicely even with the flash disabled. To those who say it took poor quality pix: Didja actually read the manual and use the camera the way the manusl said?Outside the camera captures sharp images with good color saturation. If you take a picture of a moving object it will be blurry, but that's true of any non-SLR camera.The only thing I don't like and which keeps me from giving the camera 5 stars is the short battery life. I only bought this camera last Thursday and yesterday the battery indicator went red while I was taking pix (yes I was using the LCD to look at them). It's advisable to carry extra batteries with you. But overall I think it's a great camera and I'm willing to put up with the battery consumption."
2,Buyer Beware,"I recieved my D560 as a Christmas gift in 2003. I never liked the way it drained batteries; I basically needed a new set every time I used it, but other than that it was a good camera. 40 days after the warrenty expired, the screen completly went out on it. I have always taken extremly good care of my camera, never dropped it, left it in a hot car or anything. I sent it to Olympus for repair, they said the repair would be 140.00 and the warrenty would not cover it. After 2 emails and 1 letter, with no response from Olympus I asked that they send the camera back unrepaired, and after 2 weeks, I still have not recieved my camera. Beware of buying from this company."
4,Love my camera,"I purchased the Olympus D-560 and have really had fun with it. For a first-time digital camera buyer, it has been pretty easy to use. Many have griped about the battery life, but I never have a problem unless I use the viewscreen a lot or if I'm downloading pics to the computer. You can resolve this problem easily by purchasing a memory card reader for twenty bucks. It is a little bulky, but it has performed solidly."
4,A Good Camera,"This camera takes GREAT pictures, but like others have said it drains the batteries VERY quickly. If you buy this camera it's worth buying a battery recharger. This is a really good camera!"
2,Don't waste your money,"After using this camera for the past year and a half, never having any problems, all of a sudden the flash is not working properly, my pictures that once turned out great, are dark and unusable....talked to Olympus, they will charge me $100 to take a look at the camera and then charge me to fix it, it is just not worth it. Also, this camera takes too long in between photos, and drains batteries, you are better off buying one of their newer versions."
2,camera is substandard,"This camera is one of the most disappointng products I have ever purchased. I now have 3 of them all with the same problem.1. They drain the batteries after a few pictures and then malfunction.2. The lens does not retract without at least an 8 second delay. Thus, you can't view the pictures you've just taken without waiting this 8 secondsThe only reason I used this product is I liked the smaller picture file size which newer cameras do not have."
2,Broken before one year!,"I bought this camera from a user on amazon used, in ""new"" condition. It arrived during the winter holidays fine. The pictures are okay if you know how to work it. The camera eats batteries like crazy, so you almost have to buy lithiums (Which add up in price quite quickly.) The camera now pauses for about one minute after each picture, and sometimes the lens or screen won't even work!!! My sister just got a new canon point and shoot. It made me realize how much better the new cameras are for the same price. If you are buying a point and shoot, don't waste your money on this. Buy something that lasts."
4,There are better choices..But great shots for a cheap price!,"Pros: Great software, panaromia mode, nice clear lcd, and quick download of pics to pc.Cons: Some blurryness if you take pictures in motion, Battery life, and the way the lens expands.This camera was easy to use. Tested this camera side by side with other cameras in the same price range and this one took better pictures. The included software is really easy to use. The camera has two issues. The first downfall with this camera is the batteries. BE SURE TO CARRY AN EXTRA SET OF BATTERIES AT ALL TIMES. We were changing batteries about every 40 pictures or so....which is very easy to do in a short amount of time with the ""rapid fire' mode. The other downfall of this product is the media card. The media card is not compatable with our printer's (HP 2210) smart card reader ports. Even with these little issues it still is a great camera to own."
5,Super quality!,"Pro: I just love the camera! It takes beautiful, clear pictures, especially outdoors. I tried taking some shots indoors too and they turned out very clear also. It is perfect for taking still objects. The functional buttons are, to me, a little bit confusing to use, but if you read the manual, then it should be easy. The camera looks elegant and it is comfortable to handle.Con: Battery life is too short, 2 AA Alkaline batteries are only good for about 6 pix (if you review them everytime)."
1,"After less than 2 years, the camera is fried.","I received this camera as a gift 2 1/2 years ago, and after less than 2 years of use, the camera started having problems. Now, when I open the front of the camera to take pictures, the lens doesn't come out. Instead, the camera beeps at me continuously. When I try to access the menus or turn on the LCD screen with the front closed, the camera continues to beep at me. Regardless of what I do, the camera refuses to work. Of course, the camera works fine 30% of the time. But what good is a camera that only works 30% of the time?? Don't waste your money on this camera. From what I've read on other websites, this is a common problem with Olympus point-and-shoot digital cameras that have come out in the past few years. They've cut back on quality in order to sell affordable cameras."
1,I hate everything about this camera,Drains batteries. Large size. Long delay so you never capture the moment. Takes horrible pictures; I would say 1 out of every 5 taken are actually decent. I swear every time I use this camera all I can think about is how I wish I had bought something else. I will be glad to throw it in the river when I replace it.
2,Pathetic!,"There no other word to describe this camera. Don't go for its 3MP/3x tag, there are many others things which need to be good. For example picture quality, battery life, features, indoor pics, build quality are all bad.Anyways the camera isn't worth your money. Just 3MP doesn't mean good pics..."
1,DO NOT BUY ANY OLYMPUS PRODUCT,"I bought this camera and was surprised at how easy it was to use. Too bad I never got to see the pictures because when I tried to load the software (Camedia) I had nothing but problems. After two calls to Olympus Tech Support and about two hours of messing around with different settings and downloads, I was told to try and load the software on another computer. Well, I feel I have a decent computer, a Gateway running windows 98. What good is this camera if I have to load the software on someone else's computer? Then I'd have to download my pictures on their computer too. The software says it's compatible with Windows 98, but yet it didn't work on my computer. Tech support told me that they tried everything they could. I am the only person in the world that has had this problem. The tech support [stunk] big time and I will never waste my time with them again. ..."
5,Great Camera,"I bought this camera for $229, and i think its a really good deal. i really like this camera because its small, easy to carry around, takes great pictures, and is handy wherever its needed.People give this camera bad reviews for its battery life. well, this is a digital camera, like most other digital cameras, this of course will eat normal alkaline batteries like pop corn, thats why you spend a little money to buy the lithium crv3 or the Ni-MH batteries. As for me, i prefer the Ni-MH batteries because not only are they powerful, but also rechargable. i got 4 batteries, and a charger at radio shack for about 26$ (including tax).so giving this camera bad reviews for batteries is just dumb. anyway, again, i like this camera a lot, and it takes great high quality pictures, just not always, but even the best of cameras wont always take the best photos in the world all the time.hope you enjoy this camera more than i do."
3,It is just OK,"I have had this camera for 2 years now. It has its pros and cons.Like everyone else, the battery life is terrible. Others say that you need a lithium battery which I have not tried. Regular AA batterys only lets me take about 25 pictures.Also, it is slow and has long delay when shooting picture. You definatly miss the moment you are trying to capture.Pros: It is pretty user friendly. I love how it hooks up to my computer and downloads VERY easy. Anyone can do it. You dont need to be a rocket scientist on this one."
2,Very disappointed...,"We had a Olympus 35mm camera, liked it, thought it would be good to get a digital one, went on a trip to Black Hills with it, found these DISPPOINTING facts with this D560:1. BATTERIES: It drains up battery like sponge soaking up water! I put in a brand new 2 AA Energizer batteries, 5 pictures later, it started beeping, indicating low batteries, each shot after that I had to wait till it recovers with full power!2. Picture Qualities: We took pictures of grassland and buffalos, they all turned out mooshy! You can't tell it's grass other than a big patch of fuzzy green stuff, the buffalos turned out to be a fuzzy dark buffalo shadow! (By the way, I tried all different modes) - What a joke!3. Lens sliding door - it's so flumzy, yet you have to really slide hard to shut it, some time you'd be worried it's broken!"
2,Disappointing and overpriced,"I usually like Olympus products, but this camera falls short of all marks. The pix are blurred, no matter how high you set the resolution. The macro is fussy and quickly blurs under 7 inches. The macro is also blurred. None of the pix could withstand magnification. True, they didn't pixellate until over 200%, but even at 75% they were just plain not in focus. Olympus blew it on this one. Don't buy it, it's a waste of money, even for casual photos. The only good thing is the software, which is fantastic, but even it can't fix the poor quality of the photos."
1,Olympus D-560,"This turned out to be the worst Digital Camera I have PurchasedBought this as a second easy to carry low price $ 229.00 and found that the picture quality is good only in daylight. Flash Pics are very dark, Battery life is very poor. The opening slide works sometimes , sometimes not. The digital screen is fine, but only works half the time. Maybe I had a lemon, But could not wait to return it the next day.. Would not recommend this model Olympus"
2,unsatisfying deal,"Camera has good features and software, but after 2 days of usage, two defects make it an unsatisfying deal:1)Battery life-time is ridiculous. To add insult, camera comes with no charger nor adapter.2)Optical viewfinder is worthless, does not allow to frame a shot. Its angle is strikingly smaller that the actual zoom/lens angle. You cannot frame a shot unless you use the LCD viewfinder screen, which entails holding the camera away from face, resulting in more unsteady/blurry shots."
4,"Great camera. Small package, lots of features, yet simple.","The Olympus D-560 is a great Digital Camera bargain. You will get awesome quality pictures, enough megapixels to satisfy the average consumer and a decent OPTICAL zoom. Don't be misled by the many cheap alternatives that only have digital zooms. As far as batteries, get yourself a decent set of rechargeables NiMH batteries and you will be fine.At this price, you will not find a better option. Also, the camera is very compact, but not too small. Some digital cameras are too small and become cumbersome when trying to handle them. This one is just right. Additionally, you can pretty much take it out of the box, insert the memory chip, load the batteries and start taking pictures in a matter of minutes. It is that simple to use.If you are looking for professional-level pictures, look elsewhere. If you need a good, solid performer for everyday use, this is the one."
2,There are far better compilation discs out there.,"I was drawn to this 2-CD set because of names like Moby, Static Revenger, DJ Quicksilver, ATB and Underworld, but on listening to it all the way through, I found it less-than-stimulating. I can't imagine it being a crowd-wower at parties, despite several good songs. It's simply too generic. At one point it started to sound like something you could hear in a department store. Frightening. And as for those of you who just like to listen to dance music - don't bother.I mean, if you wanna throw a beginner-techno party off the cuff, maybe try Got Dance? but if you know what you're doing, look for something with a lot more substance."
3,A Quick Glimpse,"""The Potiphar Papers"" is shown to contain illustrations by the author, George William Curtis, as well as another individual, A.Hoppin. Sadly, there are no illustrations."
2,"""Avoid this Volume""","This so-called dictionary has very few entries to begin with; and the representation of both the Greek and Latin words, along with how they were integrated into the Enlgish language is quite unclear as well. For anyone seeking to begin understanding the roots and growth of the English language, this is certainly not a volume of primary recommendation. Instead, look for the Chambers Dictionary of Etymology, or Raymond E. Laurita's 1001 Affixes and their meanings."
2,Inadequate and inaccurate,"Do not waste your money on this book. Though it purports to be 'a comprehensive guide to the classical origins of English words', one might better subtitle it 'a scanty collection of classical roots and a few English derivatives of each of them, with ludicrous amounts of space wasted on limp example sentences and excessively verbose explanatory notes for page-padding.' This book's intended audience seems to be the semi-illiterate; and judging by the typographical errors and even etymological errors sprinkled liberally throughout, its authors were as well. Spare your intelligence the insult and buy a good dictionary instead."
2,"Gets the cupcakes to the destination, that's about it.","I had this cupcake carrier before receiving a better one as a wedding gift. This carrier worked to get my cupcakes where I was taking them, but the cups on the bottom tray are too deep. This always resulted in getting icing on my fingers when removing them from the tray."
1,Get a different one!,"I used this once and it did work well for transporting the cupcakes; however, the latch broke on mine the second time I used it. It was easy to fix that, but then the plastic also broke around the latch. I returned it."
1,Horrible Design,"This carrier is useless! The bottom layer of cupcakes is difficult to remove without smudging the frosting, since holes used for baking are much deeper than the holes should be in a cupcake carrier, plus the bottom layer also frequently gets ruined by the top layer. Spend the money on a different carrier and a separate baking pan. MUCH worth your while."
2,Hate it.,"I have started making a lot of cupcakes for functions. So much so, that I am now referred to as ""the cupcake girl.""I bought one cupcake carrier from another company even after a friend tried to convince me not to because Ross on occasion has this particular carrier for cheaper. Well, I bought the other one thinking I'd return it if I indeed found a cheaper alternative.Well, about a month later sure enough, she found me one and bought it. I used it for the first time this week. I hate this thing!The red top carrier bows under the weight of the cupcakes, doesn't sit securely on the bottom, and I can't stand the bottom.Another reviewer said getting cupcakes out of the bottom gave her a little trouble. I'm gonna be real, I could not get the things out of there without sticking my fingers all in the frosting. I gave it two stars because it does keep them safe while traveling, I have to give them that. But I hate this thing. Look elsewhere."
3,"Not horrible, but there are better alternatives","For the most part this carrier is fine. The only drawbacks I've found with it are that the decorated cupcakes can be somewhat tricky to get out without damaging them or getting frosting all over your fingers (or the tray itself). The additional plastic tray is not very sturdy and noticeably sags in the middle under the weight of the cupcakes, which makes it kind of useless unless you are transporting cupcakes that aren't frosted.It's nice to use without the plastic tray if you do a lot of fancy decorating because the cover leaves a lot of room for the taller cupcakes. However, I personally preferWilton Ultimate 3-In-1 Cupcake Caddy and Carrierbecause its sides are not tapered and thus you don't end up possibly smooshing the sides of the cupcake's frosting. (At the time of this writing, it's actually cheaper than this carrier, too.)But, in the end, it's definitely better than nothing."
5,I love this cupcake carrier,"My mom purchased this as a gift for me several years ago as I am an avid baker and love to share my goodies. I have used this carrier countless times and it has worked great. No smashed cupcakes, no mishaps. It does just what it says it does and it's a good price. I was so excited to see this on my suggestion list because mine is a few years old and I while I don't anticipate needing a replacement anytime soon it is nice to know they are still available."
2,"Unless you have suffered from addiction, don't bother","Extremely disappointing and even frustrating at times since this book emphasizes on addictions and recovery - from addictions.When I purchased this book I thought that recovery meant turning things around - no matter what the cause might have been. This book mentions over and again addictions which makes it all the more difficult to relate if you have never gone down that road.I wouldn't recommend it unless you are a recovering alcoholic or are considering taking part in a 12 step programs.For all others, check out ''Sex Smart - How your childhood shaped your sexuality and what to do about it'', you might find it more enlightning."
3,Spenser Should Retire--SUSAN!,"Granted, there are problems with the continuing Spenser series.He's far too old (though quite humorous about it).His values are stuck in the '40s.His musical taste is stuck in the '30s.His outlook is stuck in Tombstone in the 1890s.But this is nothing.The real problem with Spenser is SUSAN. She has sucked from day one. I don't know a Spenser reader (and I know many) who doesn't cringe at the mention of Susan.I wonder if it would be possible to surgically remove all the Susan portions of the books and have them still make sense? Probably an improvement.There is really only one thing any future Spenser book can do to atone for all the annoying intrusions of Susan: shoot her.Far from feeling grief or remorse, I predict Spenser will feel a jubilant sense of liberation.Certainly his readers will."
2,What a disappointment!,Pure Parker...but so much less of it! Talk about churning out a novel for money!
4,"Lite, fun reading","I recently discovered Robert B. Parker and have quickly turned into a fan. His novels are a pleasure to read. I am an avid mystery reader and particularly enjoy those that contain humor. Parker fits the mold for me. ""Back Story"" was a pleasure to read. I enjoyed the interaction between Spenser and Hawk, and enjoyed the banter once I got over the stereotypical African-American language Parker employed for Hawk. If yo enjoy novels with decent plotting and amusing style, you will enjoy ""Back Story""."
2,Should Spenser retire?,"If you're from the Boston area, and you haven't read at least a couple of Spencer novels, you're missing a cultural icon. Boston and environs are as much a star as the erudite ex-boxer turned detective, Spencer.This is the 30th book of the Spencer series, and it's tired and formulaic. There's no real tension, the ending isn't particularly surprising (or interesting). It's not clear to me if the characterizations would hold at all if you hadn't read some of the other Spencer books.Maybe it's time for Spencer to retire."
3,Better than expected,"Half way through, I was ready to cream this 30th Spenser offering, but by the time I finished (i.e., about an hour later), I softened. It's definitely a step above the recent written-by-rote stuff Parker's been dishing out. He didn't dig in much deeper, but it's a shade better. On the other hand, I found the dialogue between Spenser and Hawk and Susan so repetitive and, well, barfy, that it almost ruined it for me. I'll keep buying and reading the Spenser books and Parker will keep writing them and making money hand over fist (so who's the fool here?), but I wish he'd do something original, for a change - kill someone off, maybe. But I'm not holding my breath - like a previous reviewer said - he couldn't even kill off the dog without resurrecting him."
3,"""My God, you people passed each other around like Fritos!""","Solid entry in the long-running series delivers a pretty good mystery story, a few tense moments of danger, and some really funny banter between Spenser and Hawk. Readers also get to see Parker's other hero, police chief Jesse Stone, entertainingly interact with Spenser and Hawk for about twenty pages. As an added bonus, the novel is refreshingly free of Mr. Parker's usual endorsements for psychiatrists, therapists, etc., the bane of many of his thrillers. I'm glad he's been lightening up on that stuff lately, as it was getting a bit tiresome. Not EVERYONE needs to rush out to a psychiatrist to solve their problems, after all. Finally, also interesting is that ""Back Story"" delivers quite an indictment on many aspects of the hippie generation (see the quote at the top of this review), an indictment that comes off as credible even if you admire a lot of what that generation was trying to do. All in all, an entertaining and thoughtful read."
3,Only buy if if you are collecting a complete set.,"Parker is a much better writer than this book reveals. It is a poor value for the price. I read it in an evening. Big type, lots of white space. Not much plot or character development.All the usual buttons are pushed in all the usual ways. No real surprises. Even the new dog is bored.I think Parker is getting weary of this series. It reads as if he produced this one in his sleep after much nagging from his editor or agent for just one more Spencer.If you must read it, get it at the library before spending your money. It is certainly better than much in this genre."
2,typical parker,"I was a big fan of this series for a long time but I find it to be a little stale. It's not that back story is bad, it's just not anything new. If you've read one Spenser isthe last ten years you have read them all. It's the same cast of characters, Hawk, Susan and Vinny and Quirk. Same storyline. Spenser takes a job for no money, angers people, someone tries to kill him and he calls in backup. Parker needs to take a break and come up with something new for this series."
2,Big mistake,"It was fun to visit with all the old characters, and the Spenser/Susan/Hawk interplay is very enjoyable, but there's a big plot mistake.On pp. 180-181, Spenser, looking at Anne Fahey's college yearbook, is struck by the resemblance between Emily and Daryl. Emily's photo ""could have been Daryl with a protest sign.""""Her daughter looks just like her,"" he says.Later in the story, Daryl turns out to be the child of Bunny/Bonnie, the gangster Karnofsky's daughter. Emily had unofficially adopted Daryl.So how could Daryl resemble Emily?"
2,annoying repartee,"This was the first Parker book I ever read. I picked it up in an airport out of desperation when I had nothing left to read.While I liked it enough to read it through, and the story moved along, I found myself increasingly annoyed by the dialog. Every other line of banter spoken by the characters is a clever little quip. It's like they're all trying to be funny--all the time. It gets old quickly and has the effect of making each character sound exactly the same. They're all witty and full of one-liners."
2,He's An Old Man,"Lots of white space around every page as usual. I think I would have enjoyed the book more if I hadn't done the math. Spenser and Hawk are over 60, probably pushing 70. Spenser fought in Korea in the 1950s and was at least in his mid-thirties in the first novel in 1974.Parker still writes fight scenes as if Spenser and Hawk are 40 and can stand up against younger, stronger, faster bad guys.I think Spenser has passed his ""willing suspension of disbelief"" date.It's time for Spenser to retire."
4,what can you get for 6 donuts?,"You can get Spenser, that's what. A lady wants Spenser to solve her mom's murder from 28 years ago, and once Spenser starts snooping, he discovers both the mob and the FBI wants him to stop. But why? He snoops around a bunch that reminded me of the Sybonese Liberation Army (remember Patty Hearst?), i.e., overgrown hippies who break laws in their quest for social justice.As usual, Robert B. Parker keeps his book moving quickly, with rapid fire action and snippy dialog between Spenser, Hawk and Susan. A classic Spenser novel."
3,"""stuck""","Back Story which involves solving a 30 (actually a 28) year old is a ""back story"" in many ways... Old characters from different Parker novels, old dialogue among the characters which can always be clever and humorous because the characters are likeable that way, (even if they have a dark past), and an old formula where Spenser basically plows along clueless, stirs up the water to get a reaction from surprising sources which indicates that something is important enough to keep on digging and annoying people until something is uncovered. For new readers, I would pick Parker's earlier novels because they were a breath of fresh air, and still are. For Parker fans...well I guess you will read this anyway. It's an ok Spenser novel."
3,Plot is vague,"Robert B. Parker created interesting, fully rounded characters, wrote marvelous often-funny dialogue, and established an atmosphere that felt exactly right. Unfortunately his plots often felt vague--as is the case in this umpteenth Spenser opus. I tried to keep it all straight, but I found myself lost and had to go back and re-read portions. It didn't help much.The plot seemed to be heading for some great denouement, but for me it fizzled. I won't give it away by going into the details. I thought it should have been more meaningful than it was.Still, Parker's Spense For Hire novels are interesting if only for the dialogue and the characters--including a dog."
3,A later spencer for hire novel,How killed the young actress's mother?The militant groups holds up a bankand a young mother is killed.The 28 year old mystery open old wounds thatsome important people want left closed.For me the Spencer character begins to feeltwo dimensional for all the author's effort tomake him seem more? Somehow he comes offhere as a pig who is bigoted about hippiesmore than 20 years after the fact?The second half of the novel with the MOBinvolved just left me feeling empty.I didn't like the overall effect.
3,Interesting,"Interesting, but nothing earth shattering. It's a bit about LEAN without using the word, but many similarities outside of the incentive portions."
3,Very repetitive,If you read the first 1/3 you have the whole story. After that it repeats ad-nauseum to fill the remaining pages.
5,"fascinating,amusing,wonderful book","This book is a fascinating,amusing and wonderful story written by a great children (but not only)author.When I finished it I started to read again because I missed the wonderful gallery of characters.I liked the story and its impressive conclusion."
4,I liked this book,"This book was pretty cool because a lot of stupid, stuborn kids, who either ate too much, or were too fat, got knocked up by the factory. Mr. Willy Wonka was pretty cool because he was always calm even though the kids parents were getting mad at him. I also liked the neat candy he made. I hope he makes another book with more stuborn kids and candy."
5,My all-time favorite book!!!,"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is about a little boy who is really poor until he finds a dollar to buy a candy bar. This bar holds the golden ticket to enter the chocolate factory in which no one has ever gone in. This book is so good and funny. Ilike the oompa-loompa's, the only withdraw to this book is the part where the oompa-loompa's sing and rhyme while they are singing. Though over all this book is really good. I would definately reccomend this."
3,This book was funny.,I liked this book it was funny. The Oompa Loompas vwere funny. I liked Veruka Salt the best. She is always bossing her dad around. This book i one of the best books I have read.Hope you enjoy this book!
4,victoria's review of charlie and the chocolate factory,"It is a very nice book about a young boy, Charlie who is poor and has an opportunity to get tons of chocolate (which he loves) for his lifetime. He meets a man who sees things his very own way, he owns the chocolate factory.This book is way better than the movies because it describes EVERYTHING and it is a lot more interesting. There are many more things in the book that were not in the movies. It also explains how some children are spoiled, fat, and don't care much about anything other than themselves. But the young boy, Charlie is different because he is poor and very grateful for what he has and his family and he is not at all self centered. At the end he owns the chocolate factory and he is very grateful for that. I recommend this book to anyone who likes chocolate."
4,A World of Chocolate,"Dodger MosleyBuy it! Rent it! Borrow it! Do what ever you can to readCharlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl! It's exciting because there are adventures. If it were up to me, I would rate this book in the top ten. So if you ever dreamed of living in a world where everything was made out of chocolate, then it's your lucky day. If you read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, you while feel like you're in a world of chocolate!"
4,Eat Up This Book!,"The book I am reviewing is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by R. Dahl. Is a good book because it talks about how Charlie&#65533;s family is very poor, but Charlie still manages to get a golden ticket. Now he has the chance of a life time. Hurry and read this book to find out the rest of the story. This book deserves four stars."
4,A Great Chocolate Book!,"This book is about a boy called Charlie. Charlie was poor. He lived with his grandpa, Joe and his grandma, Josephine. One day a chocolate factory closes for many years. When they open the factory gates, whoever gets a golden ticket can visit the Wonka Chocolate Factory! But there are just five golden tickets in Wonka Cocolate bars. This book is about what happens when Charlie finds a golden ticket. The best characters are Charlie, Willy Wonka and Grandpa Joe. I liked this book because it was funny and it was about chocolate."
4,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl is a very good book to read. I think the book is easy to understand and I liked it. The book is about five children who win golden tickets to go to a chocolate factory owned by Willy Wonka, a famous inventor. One of the children is Charlie Bucket, a poor boy who loves chocolate. You should read this book because it is full of exciting events and interesting people."
3,"A boy that goes to a chocolate factory,with 4 other kids.","Charlie finds a golden ticket,in a chocolate bar.This could be thebiggest adventure he ever had!!He gets a trip inside,Mr.Willy Wonka's chococate factory.Along with Augustus Gloop,a greedy little boy,Veruca Salt,who is spoiled by her parents,Violet Beauregarde,a girl who chews gum all day,and,Mike Teavee,A boy who watches television all day long.Until all the children go home,Charlies on a wonderful adventurefull of !!!CHOCOLATE!!"
3,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"I liked this book very much. I think that if you like chocolate you will be amazed about how much chocolate there is in this book. I recommend this book to the 1ST-6TH graders, andages 5-13."
5,Charlie and the choclate factory,I have read this book and i liked it. It is very interesting and i have read it twice. It is a good book for imagining things and the author has wrote many other books but i think charlie and the chocolate factory is the best.There is a video of it i watched it twice i think the book was better than the video.
4,About Darn time!,"From the moment I got my Kindle for Mother's Day, I had been trying to get a digital copy of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. My husband is a fan of the Gene Wilder musical Willy Wonka movie. I preferred the Tim Burton version - I felt it was actually closer to the book than the musical. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there were elements of the book in the musical that were not in the Burton film, and that I was also correct in my observation that the Tim Burton film stayed closer to the book. Neither of the films were totally faithful. Thank you for making the book available for kindle."
3,too much fantasy!,"I viewed this book just because it was mentioned by many people I'm talking with. It is fine, Dahl has done good for selling his dream. I, however, still don't understand his point to add fantasy in most part of this book. I consider it too much fantastic. Even if you are young, this book will give you not much more thing than making you hungry!"
4,Charlie and the Chococalate Factory,"I think that this was a good book because it was very funny and it showed how to become a poor, unhealthy person to a good, healthy person with lots of chocilate. I think that this would be a good book for little kids because it is very funny and if they like funny books and mysterious books about weird people doing weird things they would like this book a whole lot."
4,The Harsh Story,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was an extremely good book about young child who lives on the out skirts of town and everday his father works at the toothpaste factory caping toothpaste make very little money so his family is no too good off. YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK....
2,"Good, but a little moralizing","I first read 'Charlie & The Chocolate Factory' many years ago; probably about grade three. I enjoyed it, but years later the only thing I remembered was the golden ticket,the kid who stuck her gum behind her ear and the glass elevator. I remember thinking as a kid, that a glass elevator that went every which way, would be soooo coooool.Having read it again 30 years later, I am not quite as impressed (well duh it's a kids book!). I found it a little on the cruel side and a little too moralizing, as Dahl takes literary vengeance on all the things that kids do that bug him, like watching t.v. or chewing gum. I guess I just found the moralizing a little too heavy handed. But your kid will probably love it and if it teaches him not to stick gum behind his ear, I guess that's good too."
5,A SWEET Read,"OK, this reviewer had never read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - never saw the movie with Gene Wilder, and even though am a Johnny Depp fan, never saw the newest movie -I dropped my defenses and got this book, and was I surprised! This is one of the most charming books I have ever read - a tale of love and respect of family and the moral that what goes around comes around -It is gentle, it is poignant, it is a must read for kids and us kids at heart -Simply charming."
4,good book!!!!!¡¡¡¡,I like the book and Roald Dahl is a pretty good auther. So I say thumbs up to him. I recomend this book.
3,movie is better,the screenplay to the 1917 movie is so much better the songs and the changes from the original are inspired breathing life into the book
3,Movie is Much Better,"I read this book hoping for some real symbolism -- something on par with Orwell's Animal Farm. After all, the film gives you the impression that the story is that cutting edge. I was wrong.The movie is far superior to the book. Don't waste your time reading this book.Incidentally, you should know that Wonka did enslave the Oompa Loompas though and then lied about it by making up that proposterous story of ""saving them"".The portrayal of Wonka in the film is far more entertaining as his sarcasm and lies are far more apparent. You got to love ""children's"" movies that are made for adults.Neverthless, I don't completely pan the book - otherwise no movie."
2,I don't really like this book.,"I think Charlie and the Chocolate Factory wasn't that good because it doesn't make sense. Mike Tevee is crazy and he needs to get a life. Violet shouldn't chew gum all the time. I mean who chews gum from behind their ears. Veruca is just a brat. Nobody can have everything they want! Augustus is just a brat that likes to eat all the time, and Charlie is a pretty good kid."
2,Good But Cruel,"I enjoyed CATCF up to a point. It was a charming story until something digsugting happened. as soon as Willy Wonka pushed the little girl thorugh the shredder and then fed her guts to the squirrels, I was ready to stop. However, I kept reading, until I came upon the part in which Willy Wonka burned up the little boy when he ws trapped in that room. Then I put the book down for good."
2,Charley in The Chocolate Factory,This guy named Charley won a pass to see inside the Chocolate factory filled with all kinds of stuff. They got to see the ompa loompas. They got to ride on a boat and see all kind of stuff.
3,BUYER BEWARE,"This book features a cover by Ivan Brunetti, and I mistakenly believed it had been re-illustrated by Mr. Brunetti (an illustrator I admire).But it has NOT been re-illustrated. Mr. Brunetti did the cover art only. The interior illustrations are the originals, by Joseph Shindelman.The book itself is the same old story we've known for years. Not nearly as good as the Gene Wilder movie, but WAY better than theTim Burton movie. The interior illustrations are OK.The book I purchased went into the Goodwill box immediately. Nowhere on the page does it say that the book has beenre-illustrated, so it was my fault for assuming it had been.I am giving this book three stars because that's what it deserves (not because I made a made a mistake)."
4,Sexy,i don't like this book that munch because you guys don't give some summaries that a good and that children's have wrote!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,This is a great fantisy book that will catch your eye!!!,"I read the book called, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, by Roald Dahl. It is about a poor family, with a little boy named Charlie. They live off of one meager meal a day. Then their luck changes, when Mr. Willy Wonka wraps only five Golden Tickets that enable the winner to go into his factory. This is exciting because the factory has been closed to visitors, but you can see little figures in the windows and nobody comes in or out. Everyone all over the world tries to get Golden Tickets. All these rich snobby kids get the tickets. Charlie gets a chocolate bar for his birthday but there is no Golden Ticket. He also found money on the street and gets a chocolate bar with the last Golden Ticket. To find out about Charlie and his family, you will have to read this book. I would really recommend it, it is so exciting!"
5,An Adventurous Story for Young Readers!,"This book is great for young readers.It has sadness, happiness, and it is absolutely hailarious.You will love this fantastic book!"
3,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a great book for kids that have great imaginations and want to read an advevture book. Well the story starts with a guy who makes candy for a living and is making a contest that some chocolates have golden tickets inside the wrappers and the first five children to find them wins a tour of his factory and a lifetime of chocolate. The first five are Verucca Salt a spoiled brat, Augustus Gloop a fat pig, Violet Beauregarde a nasty girl with a habit of chewing gum, Mike Teavee a boy obsessed with watching television and Charlie Bucket our hero in the story. Read this book if you want to see the adventure that follews next."
4,Great book to read aloud,We read this aloud to our five year old. He loved it. And then we watched the old movie. Tons of fun.
4,Children's book online,Tjhe e reader version of the children's book was excellent and at first I did not think it would be better than hard copy but it worked well for my child.
5,Great to read aloud,"I've been reading this book with my four year old for the past weeks and he has gotten caught up in the descriptions and language of the book. He's now asking to read everything Dahl has written. High praise, I'd say."
5,"Candy, Candy, Everywhere!","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an awesome book. It is a ripping yarn full of interesting twists and turns. It is about a poor boy named Charlie Bucket who lives in a little house on the outskirts of a big town with his parents and his grandparents. He lives near Wonka's fabulous chocolate factory and is very excited when Mr.Wonka announces that he will be letting five people in his factory and giving them each a lifetime supply of chocolate. The tickets in are hidden in five bars of Mr. Wonka's chocolate. The first four ticket winners are obnoxtious brats. Will Charlie get the last ticket even though he is very poor? The inside of the chocolate factory is a child's dreams come true. Read the book if you want to find out what happened to Charlie. I very highly reccommend it to children of all ages, especially 10-13 (parents should read it too!)."
5,Charlie And Chocolate Factory,"This is a Yummy good book to read!A young boy name Charlie, didn't have any money but he found money on the ground to buy a chocolate bar. That one dollar changes Charlie life forever. He is happy that he is goingto the Chocolate Factory. When Charlie got there he meetsMr. Wonka the owner of the Chocolate Factory. I recommend this book to people who care about poor people !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Critic:A.J."
5,How can one ignore this book,I read this book because the lybrarian suggested it. I loved it! I liked the part when Veruca got thrown down the garbage chute. Little greedy thing she was I feel a bit sorry for her. I suggest this to people who love chocolate and want to hear about a world of it!
1,Great book -- but fire the illustrator,"I enjoyed Roald Dahl's books enormously as a child. I used to sincerely believe that outer space was inhabited by Vermicious Knids. But the new illustrations seriously detract from the book. They look like they were scribbled in five minutes by a hack comic strip artist. They have neither skill nor charm. Sorry, but I can't stand Quentin Blake's style. Also, the cheap paper has a very unpleasant texture, and the binding makes the book difficult to read. If I re-read Roald Dahl's books it'll be in a used older edition."
1,Charlie's Greatest Adventure,"Charlie and the chocolate Factory is about kids named charlie, Violet, Augustus, Veruca, and Mike. All get to have a tour of Mr.Wonka's factory for finding The Golden tickets. At the end of the tour they would get a life time supply of candy. But will all of them get there candy.Why? you'll have to read to find out. In the book you'll find out that they have different personalities.I think that this book deserves 5 stars because it is very realistic and maybe someone can relate to one, or all of them. I know I can relate to Mike, but I'm not telling you why, it might give his personality away. So if you want to find out what happens read this book.I think that this book deserves 5 stars because it is very realistic and maybe someone can relate to one, or all of them. I know I can relate to Mike, but I'm not telling you why, it might give his personality away. So if you want to find out what happens read this book."
1,This book sucks,Charlie shouldn't have gotten the golden ticket. All of theother kids didn't deserve to be sent home. Charlie alsoshouldn't have gotten complete control of the factory. TheOompa-Loompa's are very annoying and are way too hairy. Thedrawings are very badly drawn and I don't reccomend this book
1,this is dumb,I thought this book was not very good. Nobody died because of the oompa-loompa. The characters were very stupid. I didn't like augustus because he ate to much. The arguing was o.k.
1,The worst book that I have ever read,"In third grade my teacher made us read this book and then made us watch the movie. That was the suppidest, lamest, dumbest, worst book that I have ever read and the worst movie that I have ever seen. Since, then I have been forced many times by teachers to watch that horrible movie. I don't know what Ronald Dahl was thinking when he wrote that horrid book. Or why anyone would want to make it into a movie. I happen to like all of the other books that I have read by Ronald Dahl, especially Matilda and the Witches.(And their movies) But, not that book. In conclusion, I HATE CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY! And I give it a ZERO, 0 for a rating. ZIP, ZERO, Zilch! Not even one star, like I had to put because zero wasn't a choice."
3,I thought that the book was o.k.,I thought that it was very creative. The best part of it was when Mr. Wonka gave Charlie the chocolate factory. I also liked the OOmpa Loompas. Roald Dahl is a good author. He has a great imagination.
4,This book was a good book,Charlie and the Chocolate factory was a very good book. It was about a little boy wanting to find a golden ticket. It was also about a little boy named Charlie Bucket.I liked when Augustus Gloop fell in the Chocolate river.
5,The book is much better than the video.,Charlie and the chocolate factory how nice. It is very good in fact so good i want to say thankyou for mummmy to bring that from the shops for me. But this is what the problem is should I like the naughtiest girl in the school or Charlie and the chocolate factory?
5,My favorite book...,"Any book of Roald Dahl's grabs me. This one is my favorite, however, it brings back memories of childhood for me and how children's feelings aren't always that of an adults. I'm also a chocolate addict, so I dream of climbing into the story and visiting the magical world of Willie Wonka! :^"
5,Charlie and the Chocolate factory,Charlie and the Chocolate FactoryThere are only five golden tickets left in the world to have the chance to enter Mr. Willy Wonka's outstanding Chocolate factory. The five lucky winners are a Augustus Gloop a fat boy who's favorite hobby is eating. Veruca Salt a spoiled kid who gets everything she wants or otherwise she has a terrible fit. Violet Beaugarde a girl who sits around chewing gum she even shattered to pieces a three month chewing gum world record. Mike Teavee who does nothing but has his poor eyes glued to a television set. And last but not least Charlie Bucket a very poor kid who lives with all four of his grandparents who have not gotten out of bed for the last twenty years. Slowly his family starts to starve. One day Charlie finds a one dollar-bill covered with snow. He goes to a grocery store and bought two candy bars the first one didn't have anything. The second had one golden ticket.
5,Charlie and willy wonka,"I think charlie and the chocolate factory is the best book I had ever read. It is funny, crazy and better than I imagined. At first I thought it was going to be boring but itwasn't."
5,Excellent book that can be read on many different levels,"While this book is mainly written for children, it is also a book that adults will love. It is an in depth look into society and it's social responsibilities"
2,Should be called Charlie and the Snore factory.....,"This is one of the most boring books i have ever read, and that is saying something since i have read the Voyage of the Dawntreader. For one thing, it takes a total of 5 chapters to explain Charlie and his family. The next 5 are to explain Willie Wonka. The Movie is better though. A 2 out of 5"
4,A classic innocent fantasy,Roald Dahl's dark humor is far enough beyond reality that children can laugh at the ridiculous situations. A modern day fable with a creative twist that will intrigue any imagination. Much better than the movie.
2,The Magic World,"Have you ever visited a chocolate factory? well Charlie bucket a young average 7 year old boy won a golden ticket to enter Mr.wille wonka's factory. But as charlie visits the factory he sees many weird things like chocolate river,everlasting gobstoppers, and other things! But Roald Dahl is a excellent writer and i hope evryone has a chance to read this excellent and fabulous book.The funniest thing about this book is that the workers are ommpas-loompas"
5,my very first,"When I was in 3rd grade I remember Mrs. Duckett, one of the volunteers, settling into a chair and reading this book to my class. The rest, as they say, is history. I was enthralled by the story, and I loved to listen to her read a couple of chapters a day. The whole class would drop down around this woman's feet and go dead silent.That was my first real experience with a book. It's led to a love that's with me today. Don't just read this book, BUY it. Share it with your children. And forget the movies they've made about it, because they just don't get it. Charlie's adventures are best lived in the hearts and minds of adults and children who believe in the magic of imagination and whimsy. It changed my life forever, and opened to a wonderful world where anything is possible."
5,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"I'd seen ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" years ago, but I thoroughly enjoyed going back to the original. The story is delightful and the illustrations are priceless!"
4,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was a wonderful book. I'd watched the movie and I thought it was good so, I wanted to read the book,because people always say that the book is better than the movie. I checked it out and read it and it was terrific. I advise any onewho is looking for a good book to read ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" by Roald Dahl."
5,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"The title of this book is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and the author is Roald Dahl.This book is about a poor kid named Charlie who won a ticket out of a candy bar, and got to go to Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. He was the only kid that was not greedy. So Willy Wonka gave him the grand prize. I like this book because it is exciting and funny. It makes your imagination go like when one of the girls got a hold of gym that taste like a meal, and when it got to the desert it was blueberry pie. When she got to it she became bloated and blue. The illustrations are great and the author explains the book well."
5,Outstanding Romp,"A childhood favorite of mine, I recently re-read this Dahl classic with my wife. We were whisked along through the thrill of Charlie obtaining one of the prized Golden Tickets and his tour through Willy Wonka's chocolate factory with his Grandpa. It's a bit of a moralistic romp; what sets this volume apart from other children's works?The dark, almost maleficent flippancy of Willy Wonka is brilliant--the person handing out the moralistic lessons is not some smarmy do-gooder. The manic playfulness of Willy Wonka combined with the general tall-tale quality of this book create a wonderful escape from the dreary world we and Charlie typically inhabit."
5,Absolutely wonderful book,"My five year old loved this book almost as much as I did. It was very entertaining, and went pretty much along with the movie."
1,DO NOT READ IT,"This book is for ADULTS THAT DO NOT LIKE KIDS. All the kids are bad besides Charlie Bucket, and for some odd reason all the adults besides the Buckets are fat. All the kids get punished because they do something wrong. Everyone makes mistakes, and there are bad words in the book that should not be used. So that is why I rate this book with one star, and if I could rate it lower I would."
2,it was kind of boring,"I hated this book because: of the elevater charlie grandpawilly wonka slugworth. i kind of liked the factory,chocolate,chocolate river, gum, augustus gloop"
2,Not very good,"I got this book for the kids,but all they did was readabout 1-2 pages,then kicked it aside in favor of ""HarryPotter"".I tried to read the book,but I could'nt makemyself stay focused on this dull,lackluster book.I endedup using it as fuel for the grill.At least this book is good forsomething....."
2,Dublin Made Me,Happiness is in the eye of the individual..to me this was a tragic family life...a mother overburdened with a houseful of children and a self centered husband. All the sader for me to review since I'd read 47 Roses first and knew the father to be less than honest with family.
5,Great Book!,This book quickly became my son's favorite. The pictures are detailed and it's a great story for toddlers. It's a fun book.
4,Little Golden Book,"THE SHY LITTLE KITTEN is a purr-fect way to introduce my granddaughter to the wonders of Little Golden Books.The illustrations are wonderful and, as always, the story is just the right length."
1,Horrible to have to read,"I grew up loving the pokey little puppy and since i have 3 cats i thought this would be a fun read for my daughter. I hate this book. Seriously its soooo descriptive that its just not fun to read, and takes so long to get to any meaning that my daughter loses interest."
2,Not exactly a wealth of information.,"Not much more than a lot of nice pictures of what other people have done. This book is not for learning how to build a computer, so if your thinking about getting it for that reason look elsewhere."
2,old and out dated,"I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my hubby who is in to building computers, me I know nothing about them, all the ideas were out dated and products even more so."
4,excellent product,"This product is very heavy piece of granite. Well made, handles easily, The pestle is beautifully crafted and fits well in the hand."
2,"Great books, poor quality (board book)","These are great books due to their illustrations. My son loves them. I picked up 4 of them online. Unfortunately, the cover of the Planes book separated from the binding after only a few months. The Machines at Work binding is also coming loose. I would not buy any more of these books in the board format. I would evaluate the library bending to see if that format is of a better quality."
2,Mini Books.....?,"Rip off.I assumed these were full sized. They weren't....they were mini versions of the board books- maybe it said that in the description somewhere & I didn't pay attention. But a few years ago BJ's warehouse had these large board books for $8, so this is not a good deal at all. Besides that, the content of the books are great. My 3 year old son has them and loved them so much they're seperating from the spine. This was suppose to be the replacement, but we'll have to see how the pocket version goes over. I'd say get the books, but not here... shop around and get the large ones."
5,Baby loves this book!,My 15 month old son loves this book. He never seems to get tired of it and it has great colors and pictures.
3,Didn't realize how small the book is,I obviously did not pay attention to the dimensions because the book is 5 inches. Next times need to read the fine print.
4,my 3 year old still loves it,"I got this book about a year ago as a surprise for my son to be open during travel, since then every time we go on a trip he asks to take his book. He loves to ""read"" it by himself anytime and then he asks to go to the airport...The book is small, perfect for little hands and to be taken in the carry on, the colors are bright and the pictures are cute and totally keeps his attention."
4,Great introduction for little travelers,"When we took our 1-year-old across the country via air, we wanted to prepare him for the experience of riding in an airplane. I sought out a book to show him pictures and came across this simple yet substantial book.Before we took our trip, I was able to show him the pictures of planes similar to what we'd be flying in. When we were waiting on the plane, he was able to ""read"" his Plane book and see pictures of all the activity that was happening just outside his window. As we flew, the book entertained him with its colorful illustrations and many details.This is definitely a favorite to my toddler, who now at almost two adores planes and has flown 6 times in the last 3 months. It has been taken across the country and back and has stood up well, with only a few indications that it is a well-loved book.I've seen no other book like this, and highly recommend it to anyone preparing their child for travel."
4,"Very strong, classic Golden Age start, weaker finish","On settling down with this novel (on recommendation, I think I recall, of Instapundit) I enjoyed the flash of recognition of the classic SF style. Written well, with interesting, unexplained phenomenology (mysterious pyramids, Earth moving from the Solar System), followed by a ""rational"" ""scientific"" explanation within a sharply constrained set of premises. Unfortunately, perhaps because the length of this novel is probably 1/3 of a contemporary SF novel, the character development is limited. Also, the ending is consistent with the narrative arc but without any unforseen twists and therefore markedly anticlimactic. All in all, the pleasure from the first four fifths of the novel outweighed the weaker ending."
1,Stopped working,"This product stopped working within a couple of months (unable to format). At the time I got this, I also got a Toshiba 4GB SDHC and a SanDisk 2GB SD card - they both still work fine."
4,A Little Trouper,"I have had my chip in my camera non-stop for 18 months and have shot in excess of 30 concerts, both photos and video on the same camera. It still preforms just fine. It has been a tough lil trouper for my time out there!"
3,A good book that was written through Rose colored glasses,"Overall the book was good, but many key people and situations were never touched on. For example, there was no mention of Hank Harrison as one of the band's first managers. There was very little describing the negative aspects of Garcia - it was clearly written not to ( ) off anyone in the Dead family. Overall it was written very well and it gave a very good timeline of events (unfortunatley it missed some key events.)"
2,Better products available,"Don't be confused by it's serving size trick. This product offers half the DHA as other ginkgo+DHA supplements available on Amazon. Funny, since compared to the others, it leaves more of a fishy aftertaste. Not recommended."
1,WARNING: These discs won't play on your PC or Mac,"I love Chris Rea. Unfortunately, when I popped the first disc into my Mact to rip into iTunes I discovered that it was not playable on a PC or Mac! With music disseminated through my house via iTunes and various AirPortExpress hooked up to the stereo systems, I don't listen to CDs directly anymore and love the flexibility of iTunes. As a result, the entire 4,000 disc collection is buried into out of the way spaces since the physical disc approach is trumped by having the entire collection on a hard drive next to my iMac.Now I need to go figure out how to return these expensive pieces of plastic to Amazon. :-("
3,I read it at a young age...,"I read this book when I was 12 years old, fresh into junior high school. I'd found it among my brother's book collection when he moved off to college and relished the freshness of ... a book without the rosy-tinted happy-endings of our Accelerated Reader program at school.Now, about ten years later, I seem to remember the book traumatizing me a bit. I had nightmares quite a bit after finishing it. Nevertheless, it was a life-changing book for me (taking this statement with a grain of salt-- I was, after all, 12). The blood, gore, evil, and general terror of the novel made me appreciate the darker side of literature.Not for the faint of heart.And not for people who like cats. I do like cats, and I was terrified for weeks of my own."
1,How can I put this delicately?,"I really wanted to read this book. I saw it while grocery shopping and was intrigued by the cover; I really love stories involving creepy kids and the cat looked cute in an evil way, of course. When I got home with my purchase, I started reading it and soon discovered I just couldn't continue. Why, you ask? Well, I'll tell you - Johnstone's writing style is atrocious and I just couldn't bring myself to feign interest in it. He writes in small, simple, annoyingly terse sentences, making it very hard for me to get involved in the story. I enjoy rich imagery and his style does absolutely nothing for me in this regard. I almost feel bad writing such a harsh review for a book I didn't fully read, and any other time I might *briefly* consider trying again if I didn't think it'd be too painful. Maybe I'll pass this book on to my little brother if he can even stand it. I'd advise anyone NOT to buy this book until you actually get a look at it because the style is that awful."
2,Might make a good B horror flick,"This novel is pure cheese. I picked it up at the library today because it looked like one of those quick, entertaining novels. Well, it is definitely entertaining. It's horribly written, of course, a ten-year-old could probably write better dialogue than this, but that's why I say it would make a good B movie. If you love cheesy horror films, then you could probably enjoy this book. But if you want a ""masterpiece,"" read Stephen King or Anne Rice or something, cause this definitely isn't one."
2,From Back Cover,"She'd assumed her twin's identity, faked an engagement to a man she hardly knew.But only by becoming Alyssa could Brooke Snowden view life through her long-lost sister's eyes...to find the person who wanted Alyssa dead. The deception, she knew, was fraught with risk, but Brooke hadn't anticipated her dangerous attraction to the one man forbidden to her...It was Jack Chessman's duty as a cop to protect Brooke, and his debt of honor to her twin. But while his regard for Alyssa had never gone beyond brotherly affection, his feelings for pretend fiancée Brooke were of the forever kind."
1,There is no god,"If you have absolutely nothing to do, then watch this movie. I would rather be on life support than watch this. This movie was an insult to any person who has served for this country. Amazon should put this movie in the bargain bin. I can't write a good review because I just got dumber watching this movie. I want my brain back. By the real Donald B. Miller"
1,congrats the worst film of 2007!,"Delta Farce reteams blue collar comedy tour buddies Bill Engvall and Larry the Cable Guy, along with DJ Qualls. They three ""Weekend Warriors"" who are supposed to go to Iraq, but end up in Mexico. A couple of funny jokes can't save this boring film. Now this could have possibly been a funny skit for Blue Collar TV or SNL, but as a movie it does not work! If you want an army comedy stick to ""Stripes"" or ""In the Army Now"" those are both much better than ""Delta Farce."""
1,Colostomy bag of humor,"The writer to this movie must have spent a weekend watching Hot Shots and accidently turned to remote to Blue Collar Comedy Tour. Then thought, wow this would be a great idea for a movie! Im surprised Jeff Foxworthy is not in the movie. Must have been to busy with the fifth graders. Larry The Cable Guy is not one of my favorite people in the world, his humor is dumb and repetitive. I thought he did an alright job until he fell in love and then it got all cheesy. Sorry if I spoiled anyone from watching the movie. Bill is a great guy and do enjoy some of his stand up but he doesnt seem to fit into movie rolls, just a tv guy. Everrt was just like any American, misinformed about Iraq and wanting to kill anything he saw once he got what he thought was Iraq. I dont think I laughed much but I did sit thru this painful movie. It'll soon be in the bargain bin at your local stores."
2,Delta Farce,I enjoyed Larry's first movie but was disappointed with this one. Seemed like the movie had a lot of potential (if you like the Larry humor) but fell far short on the delivery and although there were a few funny seens you knew what was going to happen next before it happened.
1,The seventh seal,"I have gone out of my way not to watch anything with Larry the Cable Guy in it on the off chance that I'm actually entertained, thereby becoming ""one of those guys who likes Larry the Cable Guy"".It was far worse than I could have possibly imagined. I snickered exactly once, and I'm an easy laughing typa guy. Larry, an obese buffoon, has not one but two model type girlfriends in the film, with no explanation of why/wtf. It insinuated that reservists are slacking redneck nitwits while still somehow remaining jingoistic and slavishly pro military. I've never seen a movie that offended me so deeply by it's mere existance, and I've seen Grease 2 AND all the Ernest movies."
1,Farce indeed,"Terrible, terrible film all around. Nary a laugh to be found and I've read better stories on bubblegum wrappers.The best thing about this DVD is a 7 minute bonus interview with the enigmatic Danny Trejo. Sadly this little bit does not justify purchase/rental/free view on a bus station television."
1,Shameful and Moronic,"Put a copy in the Bush presidential library as part of an exhibit of the great cultural contributions of his supporters. See the book, ""Just How Stupid Are We?: Facing the Truth About the American Voter"" by Rick Shenkman. Zero stars."
4,In the Army Now meets The Three Amigos,"That is exactly what this movie is. Its not an intellectual comedy. There is very little plot development, the characters don't evolve much, and its not filled with special effects or hard-core action scenes to make up the difference. So why in all the world did I give it four stars? I liked it because although not hilarious, it is funny. The characters are actually likeable. And the story wasn't really important to pay attention to. It is very mindless. You don't need to think while you watch this movie so its perfect for the work day from h-e-double hockey sticks. I would classify it more as a wind down movie. If you want a gut-wrenchingly funny comedy, this isn't the movie you're looking for. If you are just looking for something simple to watch, this is an excellent choice."
4,Fun,"Good comedy, and fun. I enjoyed the corky jokes, but having Jeff Duhnam be featured was what did it for me."
1,WASHED UP COMMEDIANS,"This movie is best not viewed and certainly not purchased. Save your money, and maybe these washed up commedians with dry, hillbilly humor will not be hired to act or speak aloud any further.I was unlucky enough to see the first 15 of this movie, but fortunately I was lucky enough to get salt in my eyes from theater popcorn."
1,Not watchable,"I couldn't get past about 30 minutes on this one. Just cut my losses and called it a day. If you think Larry the Cable Guy with his catch phrase ""get er done"" is still funny, you will probably like this movie. It's very much low quality humor, though and really tired. Whereas a movie like Major Payne is good stuff, the writing in this is awful and the acting lazy. I would feel bad for anybody who'd actually buy a DVD of this."
1,delta farce blu-ray,"the movie is a awsome movie, too bad u dont specify that you need a special 500 dallor dvd player to play the blu-ray dvds.....now i have a movie that i love but cant watch...."
3,Ok read,"Im a skeptic in most everything. That aside, I am fascinated by the historical aspect of the man Nostradamus himself. As for this book, it is an ok read, but a little hard to follow.I do wonder if Nostradamus predicted we would be reading his work on a kindle 2..."
4,I think they will be good shoes,"They are a good fit, size and width were true. They are good looking shoes and lightweight. However, some of the seams are a little sharp and dig into my ankles, have to wear thick socks! I think that this may be improving as they break in."
3,WALKING SHOES,"I REALLY LIKE THE LOOKS AND COMFORT OF THESE SHOES . HOWEVER , THEY ARE IMPROPERLY SIZED . I WEAR A 12D AND THIS SHOE IS ABOT 1/2 TO 1 SIZE LARGER THAN A 12 . WHEN PLACED HEEL TO TOE WITH ANY SHOE THAT I OWN , THEY ARE MUCH LONGER . A FRIEND MADE A COMMENT ON THER LENGTH ."
2,"Pain in the b***, literally","These shoes have a high, hard heel and almost no cushioning. It feels like you are walking on two wooden wedges. They make the back of my legs and posterior hurt by the end of the day. They also seem about 1/2 size smaller than previous versions and are no longer waterproof. I have been wearing Rockports for over a decade, but I guess I will have to change brands now."
4,Shoes,"I like the shoe,except I didn't know it wasn't the smooth leather I expected. It was also too big,even though I ordered size 9's. It seem's they were larger than 9's,so I sent them back. I went with Reebok's this time."
3,What happened to the VIBRAM SOLES??,"I used to have these about 20 years ago. So I was looking for a new pair of shoes and not just some running sneakers which crap out after a month and offer no more support so I remembered how comfortable my Rockports were. I notice on this pair there is no mention of a ""Vibram"" bottom or sole it only says rockport stamped in the bottom sole. So now im thinking was it the vibram soles that made them so comfortable because these soles feel more like hard plastic and not that ""cushion-y"" feeling I used to love and swear by. So what happened to the vibram soles? Now that these are made in vietnam do you think they are cutting corners and saving some bucks by using these soles. Shame because they are a pretty nice looking shoe even if bland a little."
4,Does Everything,"This camera does everything it says it does. The photo quality is a little low, but seeing as though its a camcorder that's acceptable. The video quality and the zoom are awesome. Even playing back on the flip-out screen the video is crisp and the sound is very sharp. My only complaint is the manual. It reads as though it were written in Japanese and then translated by an automated service. The camera, however, is fairly self-explanatory to anyone with a little experience with a computer. I have been extremely pleased with its performance."
1,Do not buy,It stinks and thank god the smell lasted less than 5 daysThis was a waste of money !!!!!!!! do not buy
5,Good Dark Short Stories,"I really liked this collection of shorts. They are all interesting and well put together. The stories keep your interest and make you watch 'til the end. The only thing I'd have to complain about is in the short ""Spring"". Some of the camera shots look jittery. At first I thought it was the DVD itself but no, it's the way it was filmed or transferred to DVD. The rest of the shorts are perfect."
2,Well....,"A mercenary by the name of Cat Shannon, is hired by a British business tycoon, James Manson, to overthrow the ruthless Communist dictator of the African State of Zangaro.The plot is interesting and it is always good to see a Third World Communist dictator get his comeuppance but there is too much petty detail, which makes large chunks of the novel boring.I would have preferred less on the logistics and more on the human interactions.Forsyth's other works The Odessa File Fist of God , and The Fourth Protocol are much better"
1,Insipid and tedious,"Mediocre language. Unncessary details. Too long a book for a plot like this. It is full of stuff that is entirely unrelated to the plot, just adding to the number of pages of the book. And then some routine stuff like hero falling in love with the villain's daughter without any convincing reason whatsoever. There is much better fiction out there."
4,Above Average Book,"I did not like this book as much as I have liked many of his other books. Maybe I was excepting too much after The Day of the Jackal. I guess the subject matter and location just did not turn me on. I thought the story was very good idea, original. The characters are as good as the author has done in the past. There is a good amount of action and details that are interesting. The story is strongly created and moved through the book. I just was not that interested in the outcome but it was a good effort."
4,Forsyth makes you feel like you are the mercinary.,Forsyth uses actual places and possible events to create a plan to take over a country. The characters are interesting and the main character Cat Shannon makes you think twice about mercinaries. The plot twist is terrific and just knowing there is one keeps you guessing till the end.
4,Very detailed and amusing,"A very detailed Forsyth, as always. The Dogs of War has a very good buildup and an amazing plot. Not to put down, a really surprising and recommandable book."
2,Disappointed,"Having read most novels and short stories of Frederic Forsyth, I was disappointed by the dated feeling of this early seventies novel. Usually the detailed writing style adds to the realism of the story, here it just detracts. There is enough material for one of FF's short stories, but the endless descriptions to expand this to full length are largely unnecessary and mostly uninteresting."
1,Forsythe keeps too tight a leash on these Dogs,"If you like your books uneventful, characterless, dry and packed with minutae, look no further than the Dogs of War.When a vein of platinum is found in the mountain region next to a third world dictatorship, plans are put in motion to hire a group of mercenaries to take out the ruler, so fat cat businessmen can put in their own guy and get the mining rights super cheap. That's the first 50 pages.The next 350 pages are the mercenaries buying boats, guns, clothes, oil, and ammo, with plenty of ""something could go wrong, but no, it doesn't"" moments thrown in to make you think the book might hold some dramatic tension sometime in its barely endurable length.The last 30 pages is an attack that can only be called antilimactic.I didn't care about these people, their cause, or whether they made it out alive or not. It would have been nice to see what they could do with a little more plot."
2,Surprisingly dated,"Just having read ""The constant Gardener"" by John Le Carre, the ""Dogs of War"" caught me by surprise - and not in a positive way. The book is surprisingly dated, and up to last 40 pages, not much is happening. There are 2 clever twists, and a gripping end. But the rest of the book is not really worth reading. You are better off going for the ""Jackal"" or the ""Odessa files"", or, as mentioned above, the ""Constant Gardener""."
2,Not one of his best works,"This third novel written by master action / suspense writer Frederick Forsyth was not, unfortunately, one of his best. More than one third of the book is a long description of logistics that will make the reader bored and want to jump pages. It's an endless description of buying suplies, of stock market actions, etc, with the purpose of giving credibility to the action itself. But it backfired."
3,A significant pulp fiction landmark work,"This book holds together quite well, although is noticably dated at this stage. It is entertaining and is a worthwhile addition to the collection of any Africa enthusiast, if for no other reason than memories of 1970's Africa which it is bound to arouse."
4,A different story,"At least this is a different story, and in this book you will see that the people who has money and power think that they could do anything, but they have to take care of the people who work for them, specially in the job of Cat Shannon.The book will keep you interested almost in all pages, the last to chapters are to long for the things Forsyth describes in them, but so far you have to finish the book, in one chapter says that Cat swam several miles to do his exercises, but at the end of the book this is a contradiction, you will see when you read the epilogue.As the books of Forsyth that I like, you will never know if this story is true or false."
4,"""I felt as if I was by the poets side each and every moment.","After reading Loving's book on Whitman it only enhanced my spirit to read and analyze more of this Poet's life and poetry. I decieded to write about Whitman in my class at college and used Loving's book as a research means together with other books form the university library. I feel as if I know more about good ""Old Walt"" then I do my own family. This was truly a good read. Enjoy!!!"
1,"Boring, Boring & Does Not Address Whitman's Sexuality","Simply, this is the worst biography I have read in a long time. It is boring, it drags and, even though it is a work of non-fiction, it could have been more creatively written. Also, the book does not address Whitman's sexuality which is one of the greatest debates about Whitman. I suggest you pass and try another biography of Walt Whitman."
5,2005 Calendar Review,"I am going to purchase the 2006 calendar (I can't believe I didn't get one for Christmas!). So, this review is based on the 2005 calendar. Wonderful, just wonderful. If you are interested in intelligent humor, sometimes too intelligent (honey, can you explain this cartoon to me?!), then buy this calendar. I looked forward to sitting down in my humble cube every morning and tearing off the next page in my calendar before I did any work. It's just the ideal way to start your day!"
4,New Yorker everyday,"Obviously I haven't gone through the cartoons because it's not 2007 yet. So this is review on the calendar without flipping through the pages.It's entirely black and white (no colours), blank on the reverse side. Cartoon takes up the entire page, with the date stuffed to the bottom right corner. Again, black and white, so no colour differentiation. Weekend is one page. Don't be mislead by the page count. There are only ~310 printed pages.The leg takes a bit of force to pry open.Have a good chuckle every day. Looks pretty classy."
3,murder comes first,"putting an unexpected kink in the vacation plans of Pamela North's three maiden aunts. when a sip of tea causes a death, it is realized that someone has poisoned dear Grace. Mr. & Mrs. North help the police sift through family squabbles to find motive and the murderer."
3,dial is blue/purple,"I just got this watch and thought the color of the dial was light blue, but it is acutually more on the purple /darker blue range. The watch is nice, but not what I was expecting according to the photo and description."
4,Just what I wanted,"The watch is beautiful. The face is a little darker than the one in the picture, but it is still wonderful."
1,Arrived in Terrible Condition,"Beautiful watch, however when it arrived the Citizen box and case were in shambles. The Citizen box was even open and the watch was laying loosely in the Amazon box. Would not recommend purchasing this watch through Amazon."
4,Went okay...Delivered on time!,this was not the right book....when i entered this in only this one came up and i was not told otherwise...but i did recieve the book promptly.
3,Not a really good book,"This is my course book as I have no choice but buy it. But it is not a really good book on calculus... I felt that the author may had put a lot of effort on the book, but I get confused by the author's way of explaining things. I spent a lot of time rereading to exactly caught on what the author is talking about.It does give a lot of exercise problems though and answers on the back. If you want explained solutions to the problems there is a solutions manual that you have to buy seperately. BUT I suggest you just ask your classmates to help you out and not buy the solution manual."
4,love this book,"I find the explanations clear, the illustrations helpful, and the approach excellent."
2,Classic Math Text,"I say ""Classic"" because, like most math textbooks, this one is difficult to understand.Perhaps this is not the author's fault. After all, writing a calculus text is no small feat. The authors of these books have to try to include every possible concept for fear that a math department or instructor will reject the book because it omits something or other. This means that you will get a little bit of everything, with a paltry few examples for each section. If you have a sadistic professor (aren't they all?), you may feel lost in trying to grasp calculus concepts from this book alone.Math texts are full of assumptions, often skipping steps along the way in the examples. Packed with lots of ""Thus and therefores,"" this book will be a mystery to all but the few geeks who were members of the math or Star Trek club in high school. Definitely buy the solutions manual, as well as REA's ""Problem Solver,"" ""Schaum's Outlines,"" and ""3000 Solved Problems."" Good luck; you're going to need it."
1,GET A GOOD TEACHER!,this text is hard to understand. A lot of the stuff is unclear. Make sure to get a good professor to explain the book! The book doesn't hold up its own end of the deal.
2,Couldn't Finish this Book,"I am familiar with M.J.P., and have enjoyed quite a few of her books. This one wasn't one of them. It was pedantic, and written in a lumbering style: I was always aware that I was READING; whereas I generally seek out authors good enough that I LIVE in the book. The sex was dull, the plot was unbelievable (I pretty much quit after the Council trial...PLEASE!) and I had no empathy or respect for the characters. All in all, a very disappointing M.J.P. book."
5,Nothing else like it!!!,"This book was amazing. It brought back all the reasons I love to read. I have tried to find books in the same genre that have the same appeal - but no luck. I've read it so many times the book is falling apart. The characters have great charisma, and I'm alittle jealous of their relationship."
4,Surprisingly good,"The story took a while to develop. It had many layers, stories and surprises. Overall it was better than expected. It was great!"
3,Stolen Magic by Mary Jo Putney,"I have not enjoyed Putney's magic series as much as I have liked her other books, but she is just about the best romance author there is, so even these I have liked. Stolen Magic is full of adventure and it is a fun read."
3,"Interesting ideas, could have been much better","Yes, the novel is fast-paced, but (in my opinion) at the expense of character development. The book seemed rushed. I found the characters flat, and their dialogue often weirdly abrupt in a way that interrupted the flow of the story. I also felt that the characters had too much power, mastered their ""magic"" way too easily, many times conveniently discovering new powers when in a tight situation.On the other hand, as many of the concepts were interesting and well thought out. There were a few different twists from the usual alternative histories/fantasies I've read. For that alone, the book is worth reading. And if you're tired of bog-standard sex scenes, you will definitely appreciate the way sex was handled in this story. :)- Rue"
2,"More BS from a ""wanna be""....(who could'nt take it...)","After reading this book (and surviving 29 years in the trucking industry) I am greatly inclined to agree with Mr. Pendergast's points of view. Too much is wasted on trying to fit in with a lifestyle that needs to change, not ""be adjusted"" to. Sweatshops on Wheels was the definitive book on the current ""race to the bottom"" of the trucking industry. Want poor wages (when you add up your TOTAL time put in) and NO life ? No real health benefeits or pension (if your non-union) ? Then by all means come join us in the trucking industry and completely throw your life away. Everyone TALKS about doing something to help the driver, but as usual nothing is ever done. Truck drivers are STILL the ONLY labor group in the United States NOT covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act. And this book still does'nt address that.."
1,tittled incorrectly,"pitiful. this is a short intro to primitive psyc behavior on personal awareness for the road. if it has anything to do with trucking, i missed it."
3,Expected more action...,"The drills & all that's OK, but I was expecting to see examples via real-play action.After all, that's how you learn the most, since players doing drills don't have the same pressure than during a real game."
4,bookaholic,"This is a gritty, honest look at people who have been glorified in the media. Watkins' book is an honest look at himself & others while focusing on the philosophy behind the cult rather than focusing on the murders,which he was not a part of. Watkins is honest to a fault about himself & others. The 60's were a timeof great upheaval and awakening & this book reflects this. Great read!!! Warns parents & kids alike about following a guru."
1,Complete Garbage,Horror? Scary? I dont think so. What a waste of my time. One good torture scene in a movie of complete dribble.
1,If you have had kids-stay away,"You know, I don't mind gross, I don't mind scary. But if you are a parent, especially with a recent born, and not in my case, but others, one with any kind of physical problem, stay clear the heck away from this.Also, the thing just kind of drags on and on."
2,TOO INTENSE.,"An American (Billy Drago), who could have been played by a mannequin, searches for a prostitute with whom he had once fallen in love. (I can't imagine any squeeze being that good. And if it out there, I don't want to find it.) He hires a different girl on an island of prostitutes and demons (although we don't see much of the later). She tells him various stories about his lost girlfriend being dead. The torture scenes of needles being inserted under the finger nails and into the gums were very intense. The movie contains slight nudity (Japanese girls are not well endowed in this flick) and abuse and beating of women."
4,Masters of Horror - Imprint,"This movie was purchased as a gift. They enjoyed it very much. A great addition to their collection of horror movies. This movie is very much in following with Takasi Miike' body of work "" The Japanese Master of Horror"", he also produced ""Audition"" scariest movie I've ever seen!!!!"
5,miike strikes again!!!,great even for a jaded flick lover flick lover like myself...makes me wanna see ICHI THE KILLER again...physically unable to write more now but my friends at B-Movies know what i think about this one and am buying this one as a gift since i bought the blu ray for myself alreadyshaka sez check it out!!!
5,Fantastic Film That Proves Horror Isnt Dead,"While not as frightening or disturbing as the staff that helms Showtime productions, this film definetly proves that horror and creative filmmaking aren't dead. In this pseudo rebellious, bought off society of vaccuos proportions, its great to see someone who still cares enough about film to slap the living hell out of the audience. More of this is needed in todays banal and nondescript rock and roll experience called....oh yeah, life."
2,acting helps with movies,"I've seen other Miike movies and I've seen other things Billy Drago has done: this is not their best work. Drago's acting was horrible, I felt nothing for his character and thus nothing for the story he was being told. The story seemed convulted and I laughed on a few ocassions -- not what I want to be doing during a horror movie unless it is intential. Of course it looked beautiful and it was a bit graphic but that can't make up for characters you can feel empathy or sympathy for and a conherent plot."
2,This ones a little heavy,"I haven't been able to find one MOH that was above somewhat entertaining so I decided to try Imprint. I have to say it was definately a bit much. It was definately too gory for my taste. I also wasn't a big fan of the torture and abortion scenes. I thought it couldn't have been bad enough to get banned, but I could actually see why after viewing it.It started off interesting and had a creepy vibe but it just got out of control after that. Not to mention the always laughable Billy Drago was the main character. This guys overacts more then anyone I have ever seen. However he did provide me with a few laughs which always helps.I would have to say that if you are all about gore then this would be perfect for you. Personally I wasn't impressed. It was way over the top and really had noting going in the scare department."
4,One of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen,"ImprintIs Visually and emotionally disturbing while stimulating at the same time.Takashi Miike is at his best.this movie is Haunting and will stay with you long after you see it.The torture scenes are excruciating to watch yet you cant turn away,If images of abortions or dead babies disturb you dont watch this..It's a most unusual and macabre love story."
2,Miike stumbles,"Talented director Takashi Miike falls flat on his face with this installment of Showtime's Masters of Horror series. Searching for his lost love, an American (Billy Drago) travels to a sinister island, where a disfigured prostitute (Youki Kudoh) tells her terrible fate before revealing her own disturbing secret. Miike's first mistake is to shoot this in English. Many of the performers stumble over their lines. Drago overacts dreadfully, and the story seems to be little more than an excuse to string together graphic scenes of torture and abortion. The prostitute's secret turns out to be quite ridiculous. If you enjoy watching films that aim to shock, you will find much to enjoy here, but you'll be disappointed if you're hoping for a coherent narrative."
3,Not very good but not bad.,"The story is interesting, not scary as I expected, the prostitute, except the role which Ms. Kudoh played, all looks like rebellious teenages of present days in Japan.The sadistic scenes are very straight-forward but made successful.Except that Male actor of overall exaggerating acting which made me feel uncomfortable whenever he said or moved."
4,ok?,it was good...though his acting left one going WTF? i can act better than that....other then that it was good
4,It left an Imprint...,"Unlike how some of Miike's other work is, this is not slow at all. The pace of the movie goes quickly, actually I was wanting more. This movie isn't gruesome but it's not for the squeemish. A scene involving needles and fingertips made me cringe moreso then the abortion scenes. This is a very cruel and mesmorizing movie that holds your attention *no pun intended* until the end. My only complaint is that Miike made the end of the film a little too out there. I think if he would have ended it on more realistic terms, like how the movie leads you on, the end would have had more of an impact."
3,"Watched this on netflix, looking for explanations","I was hoping to find someone who might have discussed their own interpretation of 'what really happened' story wise in this episode. I'm not finding any clues doing google searches. I found a suggestion the story came from a Japanese writer named Shimako Iwai and the story was Bokkee Kyotee (Really Terrifying), but I can't find the story itself so I can read it. Frustrating. I'm trying to piece things together, but not having much luck. Sure, it may be open to interpretation, but I'd like to hear some of those interpretations. I was an English major a long time ago, but I'm not the best at 'reading movies' for clues the same way I can read and interpret a text. Any thoughts?"
3,This movie is going to hell...,"I'm surprised they could pack so much ""wrong"" into 60 minutes. Just when you think you've seen the worst of it, you realize there's like 20 minutes to go and that's plenty of time to cram more horrible stuff in. Rapid fire, Baby!Watching this movie is not unlike watching Two Girls One Cup. It's sick, it's twisted, and it's really hard to watch all the way through. If you can do it without feeling like part of you died a little bit, then you deserve a cookie.It does start to get a little silly toward the end, but it's worth a look, just for a reminder of how depraved human beings can be. If you're anything like me, this is the kind of movie you will want to show your friends just to see their reactions. It's in my Netflix Watch Instantly Queue and it will stay there."
3,pretty shoes,These are super sweet shoes. They go with everything and are easy to get on and off. There only downfall is the lack of cushion BUT if you purchase one seperatley I say BUY them!!!! They fit very true to size and the quality is good. Nothing is falling apart and I am rough on my shoes! Plus they are so pretty!
4,A Book With A Choice,"This book was fun to read. It's perfect for any nine year old who wants to read a good book with a wide selection of of stories. It's not 12 books all crammed into one it's 12 parts of books that lead you to one (Or how ever many you want) very good books. They picked really good parts of each book. It has parts of books from authors like Judy Blume, Beverly Cleary, Patricia Maclachlan and Danial Pinkwater and many more."
3,Broken zipper,"I absolutely loved this carrier but the zipper would not stay closed,because of that i was forced to send it back. I would definitely buy another if the problem is resolved."
4,Portable Pet Home,"I like the product as i can pack it away each morning. My puppy only sleeps in it at night. However they need to improve on the zippers,one side keeps separating."
1,I'd rather use a cardboard box,"What a POS. I just came home after two hours to find my 16 lb dachshund crying because he managed to rip the bottom seam open. This product was purchased new and I can count the number of times I have used it in the last 10 months on one hand. If you love your dog, spend your money on a product you can trust. I'll be contacting Petmate for a refund in the morning."
1,Broken Formating,"I am a bit confused by the many positive reviews.Flatland itself is excellent. I own a physical copy of it. However, this digital version is unreadable. The formatting has line breaks thrown all over the place in the middle of sentences. There are other better versions on Amazon, get those instead."
3,"Too enlightening, not enough entertaining","It was an interesting study in perspectives, but not so interesting a read. I enjoyed seeing how the hero would view each new environment, but there was no plot as such. It may have been good for me to read it because it reinforces my desire to see things as others see them. It just wasn't a whole lot of fun."
3,It's not what I expected.,"It's a good book, and had to reread it two or three times to fully appreciate it, but it just wasn't what I expected. Maybe because I'm so use to modern day novels, I expected it to be written like Enders Game."
2,Flatland,"Flatland is a story of A Square living in a two dimensional land called Flatland. One day he discovers that another dimension exists and it changes his life. This 19th century classic is not only an explanation of dimensions, but it is also a social commentary on Victorian England. I was disappointed in this story. I was looking forward to an interesting look at geometry and dimensions, but mostly I was bored, especially with the first half of the book. I had to repeatedly remind myself that it was social commentary and that the horrible description of women may have been commentary and not the author's real feelings. If you are interested in a way of viewing dimensions, the second half of the book might interest you, but as a whole I wish I skipped this one."
5,a sparkly-imaginative read for the mindful type,"Quite simply, this book is an absolute delight to read for anyone who is analytically-minded, imaginative, philosophical, and/or enjoys math. Classic.*~*~* Highly amusing, enjoyable fiction *~*~*"
5,An incredible unique book,I've read Ken Wilber refer to Flatland enough times to make me curious enough to read this book. This book is written from the perspective of a 2 dimensional being. His world consists of length and width only. The first half of this book is the main character describing every aspect of this two dimensional world. The second half is where it gets interesting. Our 2 dimensional main character interacts with a 3 dimensional being and a 1 dimensional being and describes how these interactions might take place. All this sets the stage for the 3 dimensional reader to ponder the experience of the 4th dimension and what 4 dimensional beings might be like.
3,Flatland,"Flatland was interesting, bur only if you paid very close attention to every part. I dislike the fact that it was never translated to new English."
4,A great intro. to dimensionality and speculative fiction.,"This classic short novel is centered about intelligent beings that live in only two dimensions. One of the inhabitants, Mr. Square, describes his world and visits a one-dimensional world. He later encounters beings from the third dimension. Mr. Square finally considers even higher dimensions. This tale by Edwin A. Abbott (1839-1926), an English clergyman and academic, has become quite popular with those physicists and mathematicians who study higher dimensions. It is also regarded as a classic in the development of speculative fiction. I really enjoyed reading it. I've had a copy on my shelf for over forty years and I have never met a Ph.D. in physics (or math for that matter) who has not read it. Any student of the development of science fiction should also have a copy."
4,A fine example of early science fiction.,"Although the decidedly Victorian language may sound a bit strange to the 21st Century ear, Abbott's approach is classic: assume a set of social rules that is driven by an alien environment. In this case, assume the constraints (and freedoms) offered by living in two dimensions. Further, imagine encounters with life in one or three dimensions. Do you mock those living in one dimension? Do you gape in awe at the three dimension world? You might read Flatland to appreciate the historical foundations of modern sci-fi. You might contemplate the themes for personal reflection. You might share it with others to sponsor interesting conversations. No matter how you use it, it's worth the read."
2,This Edition is Garbage on the Kindle,This edition is terrible on the Kindle. There's all sorts of extra line breaks that make it difficult to read. There's also no table of contents. Buy the MobiPocket version for the same price. It's a much better format
4,Flatland,This book is a great reminder that what lies outside of our understanding does not necessarily lie outside the realm of possibility. You don't have to enjoy mathematics to enjoy this book - I'd recommend it to anyone!
2,"It was intresting, but not exciting.","The book was very intresting, and refered to lots of geometric synopsises, but i personally did not enjoy it. It wasn't exciting or suspenseful. It was boring and dull. ""A"" square was not at all life like, he was weird. I think this book was geometrically incorrect. Alfred Snyzeltrice would frown!"
2,A Cure for Insomnia,"This book was kind of a waste of time for me. I really did not care one way or the other about it. A book I hate will keep me talking for weeks... I might have hated it, but at least it made a difference. But this book practically wasn't there. It made NO impression on me, and just wasted an afternoon. One bright, sunny, Sunday afternoon that I can never get back. A Sunday afternoon that could have been spent mowing the lawn or doing the dishes.I understand that many people love this book, and that it has been influential in turning people on to mathematics, philosophy, logic, etc. But I really can't say it triggered ANY ideas in my head. Thought-provoking? Heck no.Yawn provoking? Sure thing.This book is not inspirational. It is a sleep aid, much better than any other I have tried."
2,A real snoozefest,"This book is a cure for insomnia. If I ever have trouble falling to sleep, I'll just dig out my old ""Flatland"" book, and I'll probably be fast asleep a few minutes later! Listening to the A. Square character telling us about his flat, two dimensional world is not thought provoking, its just confusing! Trying to imagine life in two dimensions is truely mind numbing. I mean I understand what Flatland would be like, but only after I carefully think out what Mr. Square is saying. I spent more time trying to comprehend the two dimensional reality of Flatland than I do enjoying the story. Not very interesting at all, even two stars is being generous!"
2,"Ok, but no story","I was assigned to read this book as part of my online geometry course, and it was ok, except there is absolutly no story line to the book."
4,Illustrations would help on Kindle,"I'm not the best with spatial visualization, so this book taxed my mind a little bit especially since the Kindle edition doesn't include any illustrations.I thought the book did a good job of forcing you to think outside your own world."
5,classic,"This is also available in a Dover Thrift edition, but you can never go wrong with these little pocket books. This puts one in a geometric frame of mind that will make more advanced works on this subject, such as those by Hinton or Ouspensky, more accessible to those without either the visulazation or mathematical abilty to go straight to the deeper stuff."
1,No diagrams in Kindle version!,I love the book and have had my copy since the 1970s. I downloaded the Kindle version and discovered that there are references to diagrams but they are not included (that I could find). This book is impossible to enjoy without them.
3,"Not really ""Illustrated""","Yes, it's free. Still a misnomer to bill this as ""Illustrated."" These are rather ugly ASCII ""approximations"" of the actual illustrations, and they don't even display on the Kindle.Great book. Would be interested in paying a little money for a version that displayed the original artwork, but am not confident that Amazon is labeling these accurately."
5,Fiction about mathematics and dimension--lots of fun,"Here is a book on the principles of dimension in mathematics that is fun to read, but explains the principles so well. Flatland is a classic dating back to 1880, but reads like a delightful fairy tale. It thoroughly explains the concepts of lines, planes and the limitations of our dimensions in space.There is some amusing stuff here; the author is apparently a misogynist --women in Flatland are needle-thin, (well, that's not all bad) stupid, because of the size of their pointy heads (hey!) and violently dangerous due to their shape and lack of higher reasoning power.Despite poking fun at females, this book is amusing and valuable since it can teach some great math prinicples. There is a ""sequel"" Sphereland published in the 20th century by a different author, that goes into dimensions higher than 3. It's fun, too. As an explanantion of the concept of dimension, plus for imagination, Flatland is a real classic and a favorite of mine."
5,Great!,"Abbott has more visibility and insight into current social structures, intellectual development and spiritual awareness than most of our current ""masters"". I was introduced to Flatland many years ago and it has been an inspiration for many new thoughts and ideas since. The book is easy to read and understand, at first, lending credence to the epigram ""the more we know the less we understand"". I recommend Flatland to all those who have any questions regarding socially accepted paradigms of intellect, spiritual awareness and just plain fun.Chuck Mackarness"
5,short but enjoyable,"Upfront admission: I haven't read this book. I bought it for my 12-year-old math geek son after reading a review of the much newer ""Flatterland."" And lo and behold, he likes it! He's been reading it for about a week and is almost done with it and is enjoying it very much. He was SHOCKED a few days ago when I mentioned how old it was - a very good sign, in my opinion! I'll probably get to it myself one of these days, but for now, I am completely satisfied."
1,I guess I am not nerdy enough,A bit heavy for someone who is not that refflective. I thought I would give it to my grandkids after I read it but I gave up on that idea.
4,Thought provoking and fun to read.,"It's humorous and it also shows how hard it is to expand your outlook. The difficulty for someone living in one dimension (point land) trying to conceive of two dimensional life (flatland) and the flatlanders trying to imagine three dimensional life (space land).It was written over one hundred years ago and I have read reviews that say it's politically incorrect, but I don't see it. Anyway, it's worth looking at and the price is right."
3,Applied mathematics in fable,"Abbot has a commanding style as he weaves a tale using geometry to challenge the way people view the world. Through a cunning use of analogy, though admittedly more suited to a younger, school-age audience, he challenges the way people view the world, urging them to be more open-minded and less narrow-minded, or ""flat,"" in their view of events around them. He also obliquely deals with the antagonism between the sexes, somewhat outmoded in today's culture, as well as the resistance of society in accepting new ideas and the power of government to corral the thoughts and images available to the public."
2,Tried to like it,"I downloaded this on my Kindle App after hearing about it on ""Big Bang Theory"" and tried to like it. I really did. But now it has been several months, and I'm less than 1/4 of the way through it. The first few chapters were interesting, but after a bit, I got completely lost. Sorry Flatland, maybe I'll try again in a few years."
3,generic print edition,"The book was quite interesting! This print edition however is without any of the diagrams, and missing copyright info. Other editions had background info on the story and biographical info about the author."
2,WRONG illustrations!,"this is one of my favorite books of all time; i like reading it every couple years, so i figured it'd be worth a buck to download it to my kindle. of COURSE i paid for the illustrations instead of opting for the free, text-only edition! the copy is pretty good for this edition, but the illustrations seem to be completely random! after the author's original drawing on the first page, this edition features a necronomicon-looking geometric figure with brambles in the middle; a photograph of a bas relief stone head; some stone tablets or faded headstone laying in the grass; a grainy, hi-contrast black-and-white of some gears and such.. NONE of these images are from the print editions of the book.. or have remotely anything to do with the text! more perplexing than vexing, the book is still really fun to read.. i would just recommend that you opt for one of the OTHER illustrated editions! (if you find them, the drawings are totally worth the ninety-nine cents..)"
2,Kindle edition can't do this Justice,"I was very excited to see this come out on Kindle; definitely one of many books I wanted to keep on me at all times. However, this version does not have any illustrations in at all, which makes the true experience and understanding of this book useless, as it uses many references that can only be fully understood through images."
3,"Good book, but missing pictures!","While Flatland is a great book, the Kindle edition is missing all of the pictures/diagrams."
3,Interesting,"A whole new world opens up when you think about the differences between the 2nd and 3rd dimensions. Really interesting and provides avenues for much creative thinking. The archaic ideas about the nature of women is annoying throughout, but the era in which this was written is more to blame than the author, I suspect."
2,quite boring,"Unless you are a math teacher or enthusiast this book can put you to sleep. I have a lot of respect for mathmeticians, but I don't have the same taste in literature as they do. So for your average teenager who doesn't exactly take delight in going to geometry class everyday, I must say this book isn't for you."
2,very basic,I heard the audio book of Flatland and I found it very basic in terms of Geometry. I did like the author's creativity in creating the 1- and 2-dimensional world.
4,Flatland,Surprisingly It Was very interestingI Enjoyed learning about flatlands and the other dimensions . I very much like this story.
5,a most enjoyable read,I enjoyed it very much so I'm going to have a closer look at non-Euclidean geometry in the very near future.
2,Curious,This book could have been reduced to ten pages. Great for for someone with a third grade education. May be that was the point.
3,Not Illustrated,"I own a hard copy of Flatland and heartily recommend it.Despite the title this is not illustrated. Where there should be illustrations are labels listing 'ASCI Illustration Follows.' Now if there were at least the ASCI illustrations I would have given this a higher score, but even the ASCI representations seem to be missing.The text is at least formated properly, something that not all the kindle versions of Flatland have going for them."
3,Not bad,"Not bad, but not good either. As short as the book was (~100 pp.) it was tedious and dull. Abbott wastes lots of time explaining the most simple ideas (e.g., the appearance of a square in 2-dimensional space (ch. 1)). Furthermore, there were several impossiblities encountered. For example, A. square is always in 3-space, but is only able to sense 2-dimensions. He therefore will never be able to ""see"" 3-D, even when he is ""pulled out of the plane"" by the sphere. I also am curious as to how he is able to understand 3-D, if he is a 2-dimensional creature. Among humans, only the most brillian can begin to understand higher dimensions, but among 2-D creatures, a lowly square can understand 3-D??"
3,"A valuable read culturally, but a literary mediocrity","Sometimes you look at a book and shake your head. From what I've heard, they did that when this book came out in the late 19th century.This book isn't science fiction in the classical sense; compared to A. K. Dewdney's Planiverse, the science in it is actually quite bad. It's more valuable as a cultural benchmark describing the class strictures of Victorian Britain in an unusual setting than anything else. Its overriding message of being open to different thinking, while admirable, is lost in the portrayal of a society whose strictures are not merely cultural but biological, rendering the point of the book somewhat vague at best.It's interesting, yes. For the price of a Dover Thrift Classic edition, it's worth getting. But it's heavy-handed and lacking in any real sense of wonder such as you'd expect from a Jules Verne or Arthur Conan Doyle."
2,Relatively Little Mathematical Heft,"A whimsical introduction to the concepts of multidimensional mathematics, this book is very much the product of the 1880's Victorian era in which it was written. In a preface to the book entitled ``Limitations'', Isaac Asimov writes, ``This book, then, should lead us to question the limitations we set to our Universe generally, not only those that are mathematical and physical, but those that are sociological as well.''Indeed, this book taught me more about the backward attitudes of Victorian society than it did about mathematics. It does a nice job of illustrating what it means to project, say, 4-dimensional space into 3 dimensions, by starting from physical concepts we can grasp, namely, the projection of 3-space into 2 dimensions. However, if you're already familiar with such concepts, there's not much else here to recommend this one. The anachronistic references are just too distracting."
1,Flatland-the edition with blue squares on the cover,"This edition of Flatland has all of the diagrams made with the keystrokes of a typewriter, not with continuous lines. So the squares, triangles , circles , etc, are illegible. Since the many diagrams are an indispensible part of the book, this edition is completely useless. I bought four copies of this edition for gifts and had to trash them all. Flatland is a very well written, profound, thought provoking discourse of our inability to comprehend life in more dimentions than the three that we occupy, and it is a shame that this edition, well done in all other aspects, contains this fatal flaw, rendering it junk. Do not buy this edition. There are many other far better editions."
5,Not soon forgotten,"This movie will stay with you long after you have watched it. I thought at first that someone should do a modern remake of it, and then I thought better. Only Richard Burton could have created such a complex character; a man that both scares you and intriques you at the same time. All the actors were first rate and the direction was both tight and well-paced.A fine example of what I would call ""quiet terror"". The kind of terror that lurks just outside of normal life, but is ready to breach the veil and come into our world and make us remember that we do not know everything and that we are not totally in control.Well worth the viewing."
5,"""Absolute power corrupts absolutely""",A retrospective of free will and self determination which we lack these days of political correctness and corruption. The film is a reminder of our seemingly unconscious groping for truth and justice.
1,Some things are best left to memory,"I saw this film when I was an 11 year old boy, and was profoundly impressed. I wish I had left the memory untouched.By today's standards, this film creaks badly. The story doesn't hold water, and the political philosophy is pure fascism. The acting was way over the top.A severe disappointment."
3,Remastered but NOT restored,"One of the great things about DVD is the increase in resolution. This is *very apparent* in Things To Come.Now that someone has found a 35mm print and gone to the trouble of tranferring it, we get to see the details in the production design. For afficionadoes, the texturing of the models, and the thousands of tiny people (also models) seizing the Space Gun are probably worth it.But be warned: it is still an old print. Some reels are better than others, and the whole thing could use a good clean and some scratch removal.As for the content? I must confess it's a guilty pleasure -- just like The Fountainhead, this film is so far over the top it's a must have.Ironically, Raymond Massey is in both -- another excuse for buying it, perhaps?"
