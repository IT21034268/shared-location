5,excellent product,My cats love this stuff. If your cats are picky eaters put a little of this on their food. It even helps with hairballs.
5,I Dunno,"I was supposed to go to Ireland but now I'm not because of my girlfriend breaking up with me. Therefore, I will not have a chance to try this out. But it looks like it would convert electricity nicely. Sadly, I'll never know."
3,I thought Tonka trucks were supposed to be durable,"I bought this fire truck for my son's 4th birthday. Within five minutes of opening it the ladder had already broken off. It was something that could not be repaired. My son still plays with this truck but keeps asking me for a new fire truck, one in which the ladder will not break off. So for this Christmas, I am searching for one that will be more durable."
1,a condemnation of the U.S. and a support for communism,"Schrecker is a left-wing liberal flower child holdover from the 1960's. She neglects to realize that Communism was an aggressive threat both to the U.S. and freedom, democracy, and yes, to life itself during the Cold War. While her research is extensive, she distorts her facts in such a way that makes her conclusions perverse."
5,Many Are The Crimes - red scare/cold war!,"The McCarthy Era was a bad time for freedom in America. It was the most widespread episode of political repression in US history, encompassing far more than the brief career of a senator from Wisconsin. Those who were too young to understand what was going on yet were old enough to know something was happening, glimpsed the secrecy, sensed the social distress, have now grown up; become scholars & done the difficult & grim exhumation of one horrible carcass we've interred without honor for half a century. It is not impulsive, this tracing of the causes for this crime - it is a lengthy, labyrinthine labor. It is easy to see Professor Schrecker's dedication: she has learnt to interpret the national body language of the time, & has written a deeply researched, articulate & readable book that offers a fascinating autopsy. Superb!....................."
4,The beginnings of political bashing,"I bought this book because I wanted to know more about Sen. Joe McCarthy and how he could run rampant for so long. I was initially disappointed; however, the more I read the more I realized how Schrecker has gone far beyond the hearings. Her book illustrates the art of 'baiting'; initially it was ""Red"" baiting, where the mere mention of ""Communist"" was enough to ruin a career or permantently taint a societal segment with absolutely no legal or practical recourse. The expansion of this ""baiting"" technique of advancing personal, financial or political ambitions is obvious today."
1,Not Extreme at all,"With a title like extreme fishing you would think it would be an interesting and exciting DVD.Instead it is more of a how to for complete novice anglers.It starts with a long winded(and Boring)how to of shark fishing.Then moves on to tuna,you see a few tuna being caught, unfortunately the footage is from someones charter trip,the anglers are inexperienced and the crew not far behind(watch them try to gaff the Dolphin(mahi Mahi),the audio is also awfull.It finishes with marlin fishing,bit better,actually shows some nice footage but again terribe audio.All in all the cheesey naration and poor audio ruin it.My advice, if you are already a fisherman save your money and buy yourself a new lure.Maybe a 'Moldcraft' which the DVD plugs throughout."
3,it's alright,"My daughter (8) loves animals, so I thought this book would be perfect for her. No, she already knows most of what it teaches so it does not hold her interest for more then one page at a time. My six year old son enjoys it more, but not by much."
5,"For the camping, hiking, traveling, hunting, outdoor dog!","Being a nurse, I take the proverbial ""be prepared"" to extremes, but when you are camping hundreds of miles away from the nearest emergency health care facility, you must be educated to handle most emergencies of your family members.Well, DON""T FORGET THE DOGWe just adopted a wonderful black labrador, and being a busy outdoor kind of family I needed a concise, handy, well rounded emergency care manual for my little boy, Abbott. I researched and decided on this pocket field guide that is perfect for carrying on your outdoor excursions. I am pleased with the content and find the directions easy to follow, even for a lay person uneducated in medicine.Hopefully, my dog will never need emergent care, but I feel better knowing and gathering the knowledge needed to be there for him if the need becomes reality. Buy this book and put together a first aid kit for your dog. His life could depend on it."
4,A preppers must have,This book is very useful for pet owners...Lots of information and first aide...I recommend it to all pet owners. Easy reading.
4,Great book for hunters.,"Bought this for my hunting husband. He is not really a reader, but enjoys this book, and has used it many times to take care of small issues with our dogs. Saves some calls/visits to the vet if you can take care of it yourself. Gives you information to make a choice if they need to be seen by the vet."
5,Very Happy,"I'm not sure how often I would ever use this but it makes me happy that if I am out camping, hiking, or traveling and something where to happen I'm ready for it."
1,Typical bubble-brained right-wing blather,"Like so many of his compatriots, Charlie talks a good game in a vacuum. The fact that much of this book is pure fiction doesn't get in the way telling us all how to fix our schools. This book panders to the prejudices of everyone who thinks teachers are lazy and educators don't give a damn about kids. Thus it adds nothing to the critical debate on how to fix our schools, except white noise."
2,How many times can you make the same point.,"The book could have been reduced to the first few chapters. The remainder of the book is simply a rehashing of the same theme discussed at the beginning of the book. This should have been an article in a magazine and not a published book. Perhaps he should have titled the book ""Dumbing Down Our Kids and Our Customers."""
4,Just Rocks,"This ""album"" has always drawn me in. Its so american and down to earth. Its just raw rock and roll that I related to then and still do."
4,Get The Facts Straight,Someone in the very same review called this his SECOND album AND his DEBUT. Huh?4th album.And it ain't half bad.
2,A weak debut.,"Mellencamp's second album, but first to be released in the states, is the typical first album that does not hint at the greatness soon to come.The only song remotely familiar to the general public is ""I Need A Lover"", famously covered by Pat Benatar. It shows his ability to write a pop song, and write it well, the rest of the album suffers from what ""A Biography"" also did...weak songs with cliched sounds. The production gets better, and there is definite progress being made if you compare it to ""A Biography"".However, here in the U.S. we didn't, and this album was ignored. And listening to it now, you can't really blame us for doing so.If I'm being honest (oh dear...I'm sounding like Simon Cowell...) this is an album I probably won't listen to again.Again, I think this album will appeal to hardcore Mellen-heads (like me) as you can't believe the guy who made ""Scarecrow"" made something like this...One more thing: the remastering on this and the rest of the series is spectacular."
5,Outstanding Series,"Each episode is well done and makes me think of ""modern"" Crime Scene shows. My interests in the Middle Ages and mysteries have been combined to let me think of the possibilities of twelth century science solving crimes. I really enjoyed the series and wish that it had continued."
5,"Murder and good music, winning combo",My wife and I are enjoying the series. Though my wife has read all the books and says they stray a lot in the series. I was not impressed with changing actors for some of the characters. Still good enjoyable TV. So much better than anything on cable which we have not watched for 5 years now.
4,Good value for the price,"I read a lot of reviews before I purchased this set. I do not regret it at all. Even though the quality is not complete DVD grade what does one expect.If you buy this you are buying this for Brother Cadfael, who is few hundred years old so yes the Quality will be a little off LOL.If you love the show you will love this series and the book style enclosure is nifty also."
2,Rotten Video Quality,"The shows are brilliant: acting, script, pacing...etc. The quality of the picture on my 55"" TV is very poor. You can enjoy the show, but only if you do your best to ignore that everything looks grainy and washed out. I have seen some of these broadcast by my PBS station on the same TV and they look very good. Apparently Acorn Media either doesn't care, or just doesn't know how to transfer to disc (and doesn't care to learn). This set was $150.00 when I bought it. Given the poor quality picture I would pay no more than $30 or possibly $40 if I had it all to do again. From reading the reviews of the Poirot series, another Acorn product, I see complaints of the same problem. I love those shows but until someone other than Acorn releases them, I will just have to catch them on broadcast as I can."
5,Great seller! What I've been looking for!,Great experience. I buy from this seller in a shot. Thanks for your very fast service and delivering what you said you were selling!Thank you!
3,sound problem in the Cadfael collection,"This is a wonderful set that I would have given a top rating except for the sound quality of the second disc, Monk's Hood. The conversational track is severely muted so that you hear birds singing shrilly and actors crashing loudly through a forest but whispering dialogue, most annoying. I purchased a single copy of Monk's Hood so as to have a functioning collection but the sound was just as poorly mixed on the single disc as in the boxed collection. The remaining discs in the collection do not have a sound problem."
5,Cadfael dvd Collection,"First delivery was damaged, replacement was sent out right away and arrived without and protective packaging but the product was intact. Excelent color but the volume varies during scenes and from disc to disc. Overall satisfaction is good."
3,The Complete Cat Stevens,"Addressing an earlier review on here: ""I Think I See the Light,"" from Mona Bone Jakon, was never a single and is hardly the song that broke Cat Stevens in America. I agree it's a great one - and this box could use a handful of other great ones, including ""Into White,"" ""Miles From Nowhere"" and the vastly underrated ""Jzero."" But it's hard to argue with this very well-thought-out set, and it's obvious that the producers just plain ran out of room."
4,Great music but incomplete,"If someone is going to go to the trouble of putting out such an extensive box set of Cat Stevens' works, then WHY WHY WHY leave out some of his very finest songs (many of which are mentioned by other reviewers so I won't repeat them)? Cynically one would say, to make sure people keep buying the other CDs too. But then again there are so many box sets that are truly comprehensive that this doesn't seem to be a good explanation, especially where Stevens wasn't all that prolific and it truly would be possible to include ALL the great songs in this set. All that said, it is hard to argue with the music of one of the great original songwriters and singers of the modern era, one whose voice and music are truly unique, and the previously unrealeased material is a treat indeed."
3,more than I needed,"I'd consider this a compleatist set. The first disk is well down my list of sixties pop concoctions, although First Cut was a terrific composition. By disk two Stevie was back from his illness and suddenly blossoming into a real stylist. What a strange combination, too! At turns insipid and grave, but always unsettled, Stevens was a soft rock commercial monster. By disk three he's playing with New York's first team and sounding like he fits right in on 'The Hurt'. Then, almost as suddenly as he blossomed, he runs out of songs and wilts. The big surprise for me was that lovely live rendition of Father & Son performed after he left the biz for Islam. I guess this set makes sense if you're not convinced that the compilers picked the right numbers for the various Hits and Best Of packages. Still missing in this set is ""Two Fine People"", Cat's most realized carnal song. You have to buy the old 70's hits disk to get that one."
1,In your Hands,I use this video in my class room as a massage therapist it is great. But it is only on VHS so my gift couldn't be used. I sould have thought by now it woudl have been put on a DVD
4,"Jewish Coins, GREAT!!!!",This is a great book with thorough research on many Jewish coins from Israel.
4,THREE POINTS OF VIEW ON RAMESSES II MOST FAMOUS BATTLE,"In a bit more than 200 pages, three eminent Egyptologists put themselves to explain their perspectives on the most famous battle of Ramesses II against the Hitite Empire: Qadesh (or Kadesh, whatever). Although it may be wondered if something has been left to be said about this episode which changed the history of Middle East, well... this is a pleasant surprise. Most recommendable to all of those interested in ancient Egypt, ancient Militatry History, ancient History... and beginners, who can profit from three wise Egyptological discussions."
3,Good Explanations of Material,"If you have to take the MCAT, then this book will help prepare you. It skimps on the Molecular Biology aspects, which was on the MCAT I took this spring. It covers Physics from Newton to Electricity and Magnetism. While taking Physics 2, I would turn to this book for explanations that were more helpful then my text book (especially on Optics!). It also has a lot of information on Physiology and tells you how to read Pedigree charts (not on my test, but others had them). The General Chemistry section was decent, but nothing to write home about. In my opinion, the Organic Chemistry section was weak. Since that was my weakest subject area, I wish it had a better explanation.Also, more practice exams would have been helpful. THere weren't too many in this book. That is the best way to improve performance on the MCAT, practice tests, practice tests, and more practice tests.If you are taking the MCAT, this is the best book to help you prepare."
5,This is a steal,"Couldn't agree more with the previous reviewer. I'm an elementary library media specialist. These are among my favorite stories for read alouds, and they are marvelously done. Chevy Chase, Ian Thompson, and John Lithgow are perfect for Steig stories. John Lithgow's rendition of the Magic Bone is perfect. Kids want to watch all of them over and over. Anybody that appreciates picture books, 3 to 93, is going to like these readings. And for 12.99 they are a steal."
3,Flawed Machine,"A well designed machine with a poorly written and often misleading manual. If you do purchase this item, down load the latest manual from the T-Fal web site. The latest one is still full of confusing instructions, but it not as bad with the one that was enclosed with machine I purchased.In addition, capacity is very limited. It would be useful only if you are cooking for one or two people. It would be useful in a small kitchen if the cook is willing to experiment to learn the quirks of this machine.If you are looking for a rice cooker the Black and Decker models work better, cook more and are cheaper."
5,Das Hit Auf Hit Pary Album,They are my preferate music group since 13 years and they always surprise me with their new albums every time. This one is just great for dancing. All tracks are old songs but very very good.Very good purchase for peope who likes dance music.
3,Wasted Time,"If you're looking to learn the solo's correct, this is not the book. I hope vol. 2 is an improvement. I bought this book to learn some of the solo's hopefully correct after reading the cover which states ""Includes Complete Solos"". Some solo's start out right and then go into left field somewhere. I really wanted to learn the solo to peaceful easy feeling but not with this tab. However all of the chords seem to be accurrate. After about 3 songs I threw the book down. For me personally it was ""Wasted Time""."
5,Flying high with the Eagles.,"Some song will float in your head for many minutes after it is done. When you hear the first several bars of music - at first you may not know the name of the song (or who sang it), but some where from deep inside of you the words come to your mouth and you sing along with the radio. The Eagles is one of those groups that had songs you will find yourself doing just that."
4,good,"very good dvd, i would recommend this to anyone else to buy. i enjoyed watching and listening to it all"
2,not what I expected.,"I suppose, it all depends on what you come to expect from a dvd. I was absolutely blown away by Celtic Woman produced by David Downes and also Riverdance, 10th year anniversary. This dvd isn't all bad though, it DID have a rather annoying 'ancient' tv screen blotting out the beautiful scenery of ireland. I'm really not quite sure what the intent was, aside from telling you something of the musicians. For me, it was a big let down."
3,Wired,"Musically, this album is exactly what it should be. Tristano, Konitz and Marsh play beautifully. Listening to this collection should be like sitting through an excellent set at a club. The problem is: These performances were captured on a wire recorder, which was (decades ago) a fairly convenient machine for audial documentation. But it never could provide decent musical sound quality, and this CD provides us with a painfully typical example of that fact. I'm not talking about clipped highs or booming bass; essentially there are no highs or lows.However, it must be reiterated that the quality of the playing is truly excellent. If you love this music and these musicians, you'll be glad you purchased ""WOW"". It's a wonderful set. But if you've never heard the Tristano School's sound, get your first taste from another source. This particular CD is for initiated collectors only."
3,Wired,"Musically, this album is exactly what it should be. Tristano, Konitz and Marsh play beautifully. Listening to this collection should be like sitting through an excellent set at a club. The problem is: These performances were captured on a wire recorder, which was (decades ago) a fairly convenient machine for audial documentation 'in the field'. But it wasn't designed to provide decent musical sound quality, and this CD provides us with a painfully typical example of that fact. I'm not talking about clipped highs or booming bass; essentially there are no highs or lows.However, it must be reiterated that the quality of the playing is truly excellent. If you love this music and these musicians, you'll be glad you purchased ""WOW"". It's a wonderful set. But if you've never heard the Tristano School's sound, get your first taste from another source. This particular CD is for initiated collectors only."
2,Too boring even for Soviet Russia,"I had to read this for a World Civilization course and found it incredibly boring. None of the characters really have any emotional depth or personality, thus it's hard to care when anything bad happens to them, which is pretty much all that does happen in this book. I realize that many people were like Sofia in that they either did not or could not understand what was happening in this time period because of government censorship and misinformation, but Sofia isn't just naive. She comes off as downright stupid, which is extremely irritating considering that the entire book is about her.The only good thing I really have to say about Sofia Petrovna is that it was very short and written in quite plain language so I didn't have to suffer through it for long."
2,Not worth the money if you want more than pretty pictures,"Although I compliment the authors for the beautiful things they created, this book was not much more than a picture book of what could be done. There was very little of the ""howto"" of sand castle building. 'The S.o.B. ""take me to the beach"" Sand Castle Book' by Lucinda Wierenga, while only a booklet and all black and white images, gives some wonderful tips on not only what you can do, but **how**."
5,One of the most amazing conversion stories I've read!,"This man was a thief of the worst kind, a prisoner for much of his youth and adult years, and yet God reached into his heart and changed him. I recently read the book and was moved by his heartfelt, and extremely well-written biography. He writes like a poet, not a prisoner! You can read this small volume in one sitting due to its brevity. It is short on pages, long on inspiration! One of the most fantastic Christian bios I've read in years!"
4,strikingly readable,"after wading through _writing and difference_, this nice little book was a most pleasant surprise. In comparison to W & D, _The Monolingualism of the Other_ is a very readable book and there are plenty of ideas presented in this text that can be grasped without fully understanding Derrida's project. In conjunction with this, many of the ideas that Derrida discusses can be accepted and implented into ones own thought without necessarily agreeing with Derrida's project. An enjoyable and thought-provoking read."
5,better than expected,I sticked it on a used gameboy and surpisingly it stayed on. It created a totaly new look. If you like nintendogs it is really worth the money.
1,Terrible!,"I bought three so far and had to return each one. They are NOT reusable, and NOT durable at all. Do not buy it is a huge waist of money! I am not joking. It leaves sticky stuuff on your DS. and the worst part is the puff on top slides right off. This is terrible and will tear in a second. This is a DO NOT buy!"
5,Just the facts,This is an important collection of evidence documenting irregularities in the 2004 U.S. presidential election. I strongly recommend purchasing it and seeing for yourself what happened in the election.
5,The writing is great and the message is universal.,"The women in this book could be my best friends. They face real issues and make the best decisions they can. Just like most of us, they sometimes wish that they could go back and do it all over. I especially liked the stories from women who were past their parenting years and trying to figure out what to do with the rest of their life. I bought copies for both my sisters: we can't afford to be like Nadine Stair and find ourselves at the end of life regretting all the things we didn't do."
2,A little dull,"Price was good and so was the shipping, but the book was older and too dull in appearance to thrill me so it became a donation."
1,Very poor service,"This is the only product I've ordered from Amazon that I wasn't happy with and that was simply because I never received it. I tried, unsuccessfully to contact the company that was to send it(3 e-mails) and they responded only once, saying that they would look into it. I didn't receive the book or an offer to send another. Nothing.It's a lovely book. I had it before a fire destroyed my entire apartment. I have yet to replace it.A great gift for any senior. Filled with photos, poems and stories about the aging process, life and it's journey.A favorite of mine."
3,"It's OK for the price, but the tip, ahhh the tip, definitly not good","I am a true trekking fan, i really go up hills very often, as a hobbie, so i wanted a decent low price pole (after all it is a hobbie). Anyways, beside all bad references about the ""falling"" tip for this pole, i decided to trust the brand (coleman) and the price. MISTAKE. My fellow reviewers were totally right. That tip is pure junk. but as a said, for the price i think it is OK for it to be junk. Very desappointed on ""respected"" brand Coleman thought."
2,You get what you pay for!,"I looked at this pole online, and based on some of the reviews on AmazonI decided to go to the Coleman store and look at it in person.Well I'm glad I didn't purchase this over the internet,because I would've been unhappy with my order.I found upon further inspection of this pole in person, that it can be difficult to adjust the length of the pole and tighten it back down.Also, it doesn't have a stop for the extension, soif you extend too far it comes apart.The pole seemed weak and flimsy to me.I considered this pole after I saw that another geocacher recommended it,but I cannot recommend this pole, after trying it out in the storeand having second thoughts about it.I would recommend one of the Hamer's Poles for a little more cash."
1,Broken Almost Immediately,"Pole broke almost immediately. Very fragile and the components neither stay together nor come apart very well - by which I mean that to get the thing to extend takes a lot of twisting stuff around and then it comes ALL THE WAY APART. Then, getting it to lock into place either in extended or compressed configuration is another exercise is twisting stuff forever. Now, however, the thing is in two pieces and won't give up the middle section for anything. Useless. DO NOT BUY."
1,a broken item sent to me,The pole is not bad. It is very light and easy to adjust the height. The compass was broken when I got it. I am not sure it was damaged during shipping or the seller sent me a bad one. I asked for refund and Amazon gave me paid-post stick to print. I am waiting for the money that I will use to buy another one if I get it.
2,Worked great until it broke,"This pole was great for the 2 days that it worked. The compass in the handle is cool (but sometimes requires shaking) and the overall design is comfortable. The removable head was helpful when hiking through ice and the stabilizer worked well in mud.I was loving every minute I had this thing until the metal gizmo that allows it to extend snapped inside. I would be willing to forgive this product, but once it fell apart and I looked inside, the design just looked flimsy. While this may have been a biased opinion (since I made it while trying to bushwhack up a mountain with a broken pole), it was certainly justified at the time.My advice: Shell out the bucks for a better one."
3,"Pole fine, tips not","The poles are great, but the very first time I took them on the trail, one of the rubber tips disapeared within the first hour! I really like the compass in the handles - very useful when hiking in the mountains."
5,Very Readable with Lots of Detail,"The text is well presented with about 40% white space on each page. The important items in each topic are highlighted and reviewed at the end of the chapter. My only suggestion for improvement would be to provide an answer key. Each question and key word has the page the topic was covered and hopefully the answer is there staring you in the face.The author's tone is that of a ""regular"" person talking to a ""regular"" person. The CD that came with book is excellent, but simply not enough questions to feel comfortable passing the A+ exam on the first try.Several schools in the local area use this exact text for instructor lead classes. I'd buy this text (expensive !! like a college text) but well worth it. Not too much detail for a tech, but more than a newbie would know going in."
1,Useless,"Bought this one about a year ago and from the beginning the lights alternate constantly. Looking to buy another one, but the next one on Amazon has worse rating and honestly looks the exact same. Guess we just need to keep walking outside everynight."
4,Quite a Time Saver,"This device seems to work well and has saved a lot of time, checking to see if the garage door is down. I recommend it, a simple look at the red or green indicator is all that is needed for peace of mind"
5,Great Security Addition,When I purchased a Chamberlin garage door opener for my home in New Jersey part of the package was the door monitor. It was especially helpful because our bedroom was on the third floor of our home. It saved me many times from walking down two flights of stairs when we were not sure if we closed the garage door when we came home.After moving to South Carolina I missed the security of having the monitor in our bedroom assuring me the garage door was closed. Installation takes all of ten minutes.It's well worth the peace of mind to have the door monitor and the price is just right.
4,Monitor,"I like this garage monitor, I don't have to walk to my garage door anymore to see if it is closed."
2,Works great then not,I have purchased two of these in the past five years and when they work they work great. The first one I purchased worked for about four years the second one only lasted three months
1,Doesn't work,"It worked fine for about a week, then it started blinking red/green regardless of the position of the garage door. Tried unplugging and re-plugging which fixed the problem for about ten minutes and then it went back to blinking red/green.Pretty much worthless for indicating the garage door position. Don't think distance is a problem since it's only about 25 ft from sensor to receiver, with only two interior doors in between."
5,Installed for a month .... working great,"Very simple install, all works just as intended. Truly a plug and play unit. Nice product."
1,not very good,"I purchased two of this item. One receiver in living room 25' and one receiver downstairs 50'. I thought that the range wouldn't be an issue. WRONG! I even tried adding a antenna. The monitor CONSTANTLY loses contact with the transmitter. I have tried a couple of locations, making this item is pretty much worthless."
4,Works great... so far,"I wanted a garage door monitor and for less than the price of one ( per Chamberlain), I got 2 from Amazon. I have 2 garage doors and wanted 2 receivers - one for the kitchen and 1 for the bedroom. I bought 2 (say A and B). Opened up set A and programmed the sensor from set B as the extra sensor for set A. Then opened up set B and programmed the sensor from set A as the extra sensor for set B. Mounted one in the kitchen with the included velcro strips, mounted the second in the bedroom, with the velcro strip on the wall wart so that the receiver attaches directly to the wall wart, and is visible from my bed. Mounted the sensors on each of the garage doors using a screw through the back of the sensor (had to drill a small hole in the back of each sensor. The receivers blink when either garage door is open. So for <$40, I have exactly what I was looking for! This monitor was not available in either HD or Lowes in my area."
2,It's okay...,"At least 4 times a day, the lights would start toggling as it loses signal and I had to unplug and re-plug the power cord.There's no ability to shut the garage door - which is something I thought it had, but it's my fault for not reading it.I'm sure there's something better out there..."
4,So far exactly what was expected,"Works great , easy to install. Main key is that is last and the battery life but initial review is great"
2,Review of Chamberlain Garage Door Monitor,"Very disappointed in purchase. Actual item does not match picture shown.Deceptive Advertising. I even wrote and reported this issue, but todate nothing has been changed or rectified. It's so simple too. Justlook at the item pictured, it appears white, which is what I wanted.After receiving the product, it was actually tan, so I had to send itback."
2,don't buy it,This product comes in a gray color with a black transformer (Ugly)The indicator is hard to install and the transmitter needs to be screwed in place instead od relying on velcro.There are better products on the market.
2,Signal distance too short,We have a rectangle shaped house about 100 feet long. The signal would not reach from the garage on one end to the master bedroom on the other end which defeated our purpose for using the monitor.
1,"POOR PRODUCT, STOPPED WORKING","Chamberlain CLDM1 Clicker Garage Door Monitor IS A POOR PRODUCT, STOPPED WORKING, DON'T BUY, IF AMAZON ALLOWS ITS MARKET SPACE TO BECOME A DUMPING GROUNDS FOR DEFECTIVE MERCHANDISE, SERIOUSLY RECONSIDER THIS BUSINESS APPROACH."
4,You should have one,This unit works pretty well. It attaches to the inside of your overhead door and only sends a signal if open. The batteries last a very long time. It does have a little bit of a range problem. I had to move it around until I got a good signal.
3,Seems tempermental with distance,"I have had this for about 8 months now. It is about 40 feet from the garage door. It will work for a day and then disconnect, reconnect, and then every few days disconnect and not reconnect. I will unplug it and plug it back in and then it finds the garage door again. every couple of months it forgets the pairing and I have pair them back again. I have learned an easy trick after doing it a few times. I can take the transmitter off the Velcro on the door and carry it to the receiver, press the reset button, flip it horizontal, and back vertical, and it is back paired again. I am sure I am pushing the distance limit. But it is still a pain that it needs to be paired back every couple of months... but when it works, it rocks."
5,My favorite gadget,This thing is great! I was always second guessing myself if I remembered to close the garage door. A quick glance at the receiver and I know it's closed. The receiver needs to be located near an AC outlet and uses a wall wart for power. The sender simply attaches to the inside of the garage door with Velcro tape. It took all of 2 minutes to install!
4,Works as advertised!,"My garage is a separate building about 15' away from my house, so I needed something to tell me if I left the door open. I'm using this about 100' away from the transmitter - a bit too much for it. It worked fine at first, but then would lose signal on occasion. I noticed that the receiver had an antenna but the transmitter didn't. I opened up the transmitter and found the antenna ""loop"" - I simply soldered on a piece of wire of the appropriate length (this uses 390mhz, so I used a 1/2 wave length of wire, which is 14.4 inches). Works perfectly now!"
1,Warning!,"This monitor started failing after a month (of which, unfortunately, we were away for over 2 weeks). After testing and re-programming and changing batteries 3 times at $2.50 a pop, it was apparent that the sending units were defective. Called Chamberlain, who agreed that the sending units (sensors) were defective. THEY WILL NOT DO ANYTHING FOR YOU IF YOU BUY THROUGH AMAZON!! THESE PRODUCTS DO NOT HAVE A FACTORY WARRANTEE! You have 30 days to return defective products to Amazon. After that you have garbage."
4,No problems,"I received this item three weeks ago. Installation was easy and the unit worked as specified. I didn't have a problem with any distance, however my garage door is only about 50 feet away from the base unit.You do have to plug the base unit into a wall outlet and it has a slightly bulky transformer. I didn't know that when I purchased it. I thought both units were battery operated. So you can't just hang the base unit up on a wall in the house somewhere.Overall I gave it four stars."
1,No contact with transmitters is a recurring issue,"Went ahead and purchased this inspite of past stated concerns about range issues.I purchased two units and both work equally poorly.I tried several locations but if the receivers and transmitters are not in the same room together there is the flashing green and red signals indicating no contact with the transmitter. I frankly think that it is more likely an electrical interference problem with these units than a range problem.We have a fairly high tech house with multiple wireless items eg.Security System,Internet,Cable etc. I think that if you have multiple signals being transmitted in your home that it simply interferes with the operation of the 'hook up' between the transmitter and receiving unit.I suggest that you take this into careful consideration BEFORE you purchase one of these units.Mine are both going back to Amazon today."
3,Range issue,"I think the range is an issue. My monitor blinks red & green when door is closed, and I estimate the range from the door to be 60 feet. When monitor brought closer to about 40 feet, works o.k. Problem is intermittent, though I'm not sure why."
4,"works great, aesthetics lacking a little","The device works good. I live in a condo, 2nd floor, and the garage is 1st floor, and it works having the sensor on the garage and the monitor in my kitchen.It is a life saver, because no longer do you go, ""Did i shut the garage?"" or even sometimes something impedes the garage from going all the way down, well now you know! And knowing is half the battle!"
3,"Location, location, location","The system was easy to install and worked just fine... sometimes. After several exchanges with Chamberlain tech support, I would submit that the system doesn't like to be around WIFI systems, portable phone systems and/or several walls (2 in our case) and distance (68 feet in our case). The manufacturer also wants the monitor to be plugged into a ""sole use"" receptacle and so on.If you don't have our location problems, the system appears to work well and is easy to install which is the only reason I gave it 3-stars. It does work, just not for me."
2,Chamberlain CLDM1 Clicker Garage Door Monitor,"I have a detached garage..fifty feet away. I purchased this in december in New England. Installation was easy. I put the base unit near the bed so I will know if the garage door opens in the middle of the night. The Unit starts flashing and you have to unplug and replug back in.This happens almost every night. Worst when it gets colder. I purchased this to replace my sears unit, but the sears unit works much better.. This unit is probably OK if not too far away from transmitter."
5,Works great,"I have this unit mounted in the kitchen about 20 ft from the door transmitter, going through 2 brick walls. So far (about a month of use), we've had no problems. It has saved me from leaving the garage door open all night at least twice. Delivery was also quick to an overseas APO address in the UK."
4,Works great ... 99% of the time,"I was watching this item and then the price went down to about $21 on Amazon, so I bought it a month or so ago. The pre-install test didn't work well just by tilting the sensor, because it requires vibration to move the sensor (it sounds like a BB but is probably a little metal swing gate). It's been working very well, except for a week or so ago my wife asked before bed if the garage door was shut. I looked at the solid green light and said yes. She opened the inside door to check and the garage door was open. I tapped on the sensor to try to close the switch, but it wouldn't turn to flashing red. Next time closing and opening the door it worked fine, and has worked fine since then. It sort of defeats the purpose if you can't trust it and have to open the door to check for certain."
2,believe the reviews,Well the reviews said there was problems with this. We got it for our mother and the lights would flash open all the time so we took it home and hooked it up at our house. It worked for a week so we took it back to mom's and it worked for 1 day then started flashing again. There must but something that can interfere with it and other places it will work fine. She lives in the city us in the country.(could be the problem???)
3,"Worked great for a year, then stopped","Stopped working after a year. Replacing the battery, reprogramming, and resetting as per the manual didn't help. Still trying to decide whether it's worth buying one each year, because it was great while it lasted."
2,This doesn't work,This product does not work. It is accurate for about 15 minutes and then indicates an open garage door when the door remains closed. It is installed correctly. I have waited to write this review to give a fair and accurate account. After more than a week it has malfunctioned about 75% of the time. When I go to bed the garage door is closed and the green light is on as it should be. I wake up to see the red light flashing and have to go outside to see if the garage door is in fact open each time. It is a pain. I bought this product precisely to avoid having to get up at night to see if the door has been left open.
4,Works well but not perfect,I have installed the transmitter on the garage door and have the receiver next to the TV in my family room. I found the adhesive on the Velcro didn't work well on the steel door but that was easily resolved using zip ties to attach it. The transmitter will occasionally get confused and blinks red/green. Unplugging it resolves the issue and most the time it works great.
4,Up or Down,It's a simple little gadget that lets me know if I forgot to close the garage. It works splendidly and was shipped promptly.
1,Never worked properly,"I had also ordered a second transmitter. The garage doors are about 30 feet from receiver. On the first day or two it registered properly. After that, the receiver would alternate between the door(s) opened or closed. The red and green lights would alternate. Even when it worked properly, within a few hours it was confused and started alternating red and greed lights. I tried removing one of the transmitters and even changed batteries. No remedy worked and I finally removed the entire system. Unfortunately I am outside of the return window. I would NOT recommend this product."
1,Chamberlain CLDM1 Clicker Garage Door Monitor,I cannot rate this product higher than one star. When I plugged it into my wall socket it blew up. This is probably due to the power supply in South Africa being much higher voltage than in the USA. This product should spell out clearly that it is limited to usage in countries with a power supply similar to that in the USA. Mine went straight into the garbage at a considerable monetary loss to me.
3,Garage Door Monitor may not fit your needs,I purchased the Chamberlain Door Monitor and am not using it where I wanted. I wanted to install it on my garage [Clopay] door but it would require a special mount to work. I liked the design because it alarms when the raises only a few inches (my old one alarms at about 18 inches). I also bought the motion sensor as a second sensor. Both sensors worked but I could not tell which was alarming. If one alarmed then there was a constant beep which could be disabled. It would be better if it beeped only a few time the flashed the light. It was just not a fit for my application. I probably will use it elsewhere but not soon.
3,"Garage Door Monitor - OK, but not perfect","After unintentionally leaving our garage door open overnight several times, I decided we needed some kind of monitor. This seemed to be a good choice based on design. It was very easy to assemble and install... probably took less than 10 min to pop in the battery and affix the velcro fastener to the garage door and sensor/transmitter. When I tested it at close range, it works as advertised with the green light on when the door is closed and the red light on when the door is open. When I moved the receiver to a convenient location in my house and waited ~20 min, the green light and red light started flashing, which indicated a failure to receive the signal. I moved the receiver to a spot in my house that was closer to the garage, and things seem to be working now. But I was disappointed with the range of the device."
2,Door Monitor,"If the power flickers or goes out, sometimes you have to un-plug the monitor to re-set the unit. When you mount the unit on the wall by the screw hole on the back, the PC board is so close to the hole, you have to use a thin headed nail, or the screw shorts out the board."
4,GREAT SAFETY ITEM,"Works fine. However, the stick-on attachment item on the back does not last long. If you open the Monitor, you will find holes for using screws and this makes it work just fine by screwing it onto your garage door."
2,BUY A DIFFERENT MODEL!,"We had a Sears door monitor for over 10 years and it eventually failed. Replaced the Sears unit with this one from Chamberlain. It's lasted no more than 2 years. Like other reviews, my unit started to flash the red and green lights together, Unplugging the unit and replacing the batteries did not resolve the issue...The theory behind the door monitor is great and my family highly depends on the signal to ensure the door has been closed. I will definately purchase another door monitor, just not this model from Chamberlain."
4,garage door monitor,"This is a great little model, we put it right next to the cable box so we can see that the door is closed at a glance instead of having to check the door by opening door to garage."
2,"Worked for a while, then....","It worked for a month or two. Then it died. I tracked the failure down to the base unit. The 4 MHz ceramic resonator died. I replaced it with a 4 MHz crystal oscillator, removed the two loading caps and now I am back up running."
3,Works as expected for $$,"Product functions as expected. Would be nice if it transmitted farther, but that is not a major issue for us."
4,Very useful. Easy to install,PROs:-The installation is very easy;-The range is decent > 40');CONs:-No alarm sound as red flashing light may be overlooked.
3,too quiet,"a sound alarm to remind you that the garage door is still open, rather than just a blinking red light would have been better."
1,Horrible design,"Tested out the case of out-of-battery. The receiver stays at its last known state, when the battery is transmitter's battery is dead. Thus, if the battery dies while the garage door is down, the receiver will always indicate that the garage door is down, regardless of actual situation."
4,Good Product,"This product was easy to install,set up and works well. I only wish it had a short audible alarm when the garage door is going up..."
2,Dissapointed,"I received this item, read all the directions. Plugged it in and it workedfor about 2 weeks, then no matter what I do it does not work right. Both theGreen and Red lights blink constantly, I unplug, re-program and it lasts for\like maybe a minute or two then back to Green and Red blinkng.I feel this product is almost worthless and would not reccommend or buy thisproduct again."
2,PowerShred not what I expected.,I expected a little more commercial type shredder. Not very powerful and the blades appear dull. Certainly didn't get my monies worth.
5,"Haven't warped yet, very smooth breaking","I installed this rotor on a 1997 Honda Accord SE 4-door without ABS, which if you one one then you know that it is absolute nightmare to replace the rotors on a car that has a captive hub-over-rotor setup. I chose to spend a little extra money and go with these rotors because I had bad luck with a pair of centric rotors which seemed to warp with only a few thousand miles on them. This rotor seems to perform exceptionally, no pulsating in the break peddle whatsoever, the measured run-out was sub millimeter across both sides and the slotted feature gives very smooth deceleration during wet conditions. A huge plus with these over conventional rotors is these will not give a rusted out look after a humid day."
3,Interesting disc...good and bad...,"I bought this when it was on sale, and I would recomennd it at a lesser price. The Gaspard is good, not quite up to his earlier recording, but the lesser known works here were never recorded anywhere else. The Scriabin is surprising successful with Gieseking's touch, which kind of made me rethink how it should sound, imagine the sound he has with the debussy preludes, that delicacy, matched with Scriabins, fragility, it really is a wonder. The schubert is also successufl though far from great, it is too sensitive. The Beethoven is nothing new. This disc however are wrong, which doesnt matter once you figure it out, but the albels are inaccurate.Most casual customers wont buy this, so it is supposed to appeal to fans of Gieseking and there is enough new material here for those to want this, and for those people, it is highly recommendable."
5,Highly recommended in 3D!,"Nobody directs an action-adventure like Steven Spielberg and with Peter Jackson's company providing the amazing animation, this film is a winner. It's probably not suitable for younger children, parents may want to consider the depiction of Captain Haddock's cartoon drunkenness (true to the books that were written decades ago) and the non-graphic violence."
4,Great 3D and CGI; Storyline and Pacing were a little slow.,"Great 3D and CGI; Storyline and Pacing were a little slow. I grew up with the comic and cartoon series, and somehow the screenplay was missing the fun with Tin Tin I had from back then. Perhaps I've been jaded by the Indiana Jones series."
4,"Fantastic movie, amazing disc","The animation of this movie is nothing short of spectacular. It's Pixar class... The story is good, but could be even better. Let's hope part two incorporates what part one lacks. Amazing sound and video on this."
5,6 STARS!!,Indiana Jones for kids! Fun Fun Fun! The animation was so realistic. WOW! This is a movie I could watch again and again. Looking forward to the next one.
3,"Animation is great, but....","It is a joy to watch such a quality semi animated/live movie and see my childhood hero in a full length movie.Teh ending left me ""empty"""
3,Not as much of a kids movie as was thinking.,Was an all right movie. The kids didn't like it as much as we were expecting. Not as kid friendly.
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"I think the lack of realism ruined the movie for me. I'm not talking about the graphics they look great except for the fact that everyone besides the main character has an overly large nose which I really didn't like, I'm talking about the story in general. Its starts out very interesting but loses my attention when the main character is able to overcome so many adversities so easily. It just seemed like lazy writing to me. If the main character had not so easily overcome his obstacles I probably would have enjoyed the movie. Also the second lead character is rather annoying. I don't think this movie is excellent. I think its okay but I don't recommend it."
2,"Too Much, with too little editing",I have read all the TinTin 'books' and know the stories and characters. This rendition crammed too many storiesand too many characters into one hyper hectic film leaving this viewer exhausted. It seems the director and producersensed they had only this one opportunity so they used a scatter shot.
3,Not very good...,"I'm a huge Tintin fan! I grew up reading the graphic novels and was really looking forward to this movie.However, as others have said, the plot is very chaotic and hard to follow. I don't know why they mixed together multiple books and then left a kind of lame cliffhanger ending. This did nothing to appease existing Tintin fans and won't earn any new ones.Of course, this is Spielberg, so the production was excellent. I didn't find the animation style creepy at all.But the confusing plot made this hard to watch. I doubt there will be any further movies, and if there are, I hope they get a different writer."
5,If I had more stars I would have patched it up here...,"What a fantastic movie...Truly, only a master director could have done this!! I last read Tintin comic books as a 10 year old kid, now watching it after few decades took me back to good old times, what a pleasure it was, I just did not want it to end.The story flow is extremely well conjoined to make one excellent movie out of 3 comic books (The Secret of the Unicorn, Red Rackham's Treasure and The Crab with the Golden Claws). The characters are very well cast, and I wish some how ""Professor Calculus"" could have fitted into this movie, I missed him. I am glad that the director just did not lift the movie frame by frame from the comic books, instead he decided to add and subtract his own action sequences, which makes this movie brilliant, adds a newer feel and is pleasure to watch.I look forward to a sequel now..."
2,didn't hold interest,"This had a good review by Roger Ebert, so I was optomistic. The animation is very well done, production is good, pacing is good, but it just didn't engage me. I lost interest half way through, which is really unsual for me. It isn't bad, I'm sure many folks would like it, especially kids."
2,Boring with a capital B,I do like fantasy. I do like special effects. I do like S. Spielberg. I bought it for those 3 reasons. This is very much a kids movie. Both my husband and I almost clapped when it was over just because it was OVER. One of the worst movies we have sat through. I couldn't find one good reason to watch this again.
3,ZZZZZZZ,"Fell asleep half way through. Typical overdone Spielberg. The CGI animation, and violence, are bit too realistic to render this a lighthearted animation feature. Also, the ""humor"" was forced, silly and flat, IMHO. Give me The Incredibles any day over this one."
2,The movie was OK but the quality was subpar. The movie kept stopping thoughout the show making it almost unwatchable.,The movie was OK but the quality was subpar. The movie kept stopping though-out the show making it almost unwatchable.
5,Terrific adventure movie for kids and adults.,"I love this movie. The plot is great fun. The art work is out of this world exceptional. The characters are drawn well but seem to be more cartoony than the backgrounds, which is my only minor objection to this overall wonderful production."
2,Tintin a disappointment despite super graphics and cute characters,Story line just o.k.; graphics super; too long by far; viewed it with grandchildren ages 11 and 8; they found it not so interesting but wanted to see how it ended. Threw the video away after viewing it; not worth saving. Sorry.
5,great movie!,from a devoted Tin Tin fan - this fulfilled all my expectations.Spielberg is a fantastic movie maker all around
2,Animation didn't make up for a weak storyline,Sorry to all you folks. My wife and I just didn't like the show. Save your time and pass on this movie.
3,The Adventures of Tintin,"This cgi adventure movie is fun, a little unbelievable in places, as Tintin seems to have an ease of escaping danger. It has a happy ending."
2,Snoozer,I feel asleep while my husband watched this one. I heard him laugh out loud several times but he said later it was not a good movie.
4,Animation Exelence,The plot is fun and Tintin is unique and quirky. Graphics are colorful and fluid. 1930's settings cars and planes feel like an episode of Poirot. I'm looking forward to the next episode.
5,the adventures of tintin,I think this item is very well put together and I find it very intertaining. I liked it very much.
4,I enjowed this a lot but I am very familiar with all the TinTin stories from time spent in Europe. It might be less interesting,(cont'd) for people without this background.The color and animation were great and very true to the Herge originalsfrom the comic books.
2,Bummer,I did not care for the adventures of tintin. My 12 yr old son didn't like it either. The short cartoons were better.
5,From Academy Award winning filmmakers Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson comes the epic adventures of Tintin. Racing to uncover,"From Academy Award winning filmmakers Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson comes the epic adventures of Tintin. Racing to uncover the secrets of a sunken ship, Tintin and his loyal dog Snowy embark on an action-packed journey around the world.Starring: Jamie Bell, Andy SerkisDirected by: Steven SpielbergRuntime: 1 hour 47 minutesRelease year: 2011Studio: Paramount"
3,The Adventures of Tin Tin,"This movie was just okay to me. I think that I had higher expectations. It's not a bad movie , it's just not great !"
5,"great comics, good movie!",i read all the comics since childhood and i still enjoy them. i would rate this adaptation of one of the greatest comic books 4.5!
2,"too loud, violent and abrupt","It was too loud, violent and abrupt. So I had no reason to get involved, just put off and i clicked off."
3,good animation,"I fell asleep watching this movie, so I gave it an ""ok"" didn't get the watch the entire movie yet.. may yet be interesting, though I'm not all that hyped to watch it again."
4,Amazing!,Really loved it. The dialogues and action sequences and story. I hope they're making a second part for this series.
4,I ready enjoyed this,"kind of long but it was fun, looked realiy,real The did like it , but bored after three- quarter though"
2,Great animation--that's about it.,"Animation was terrific--everything else left me, well, unsatisfied. It would be a great film for kids, except that there's a lot of violence. The plot and and characters are far too predictable for adults to enjoy . . . so who's left? People may disagree with me and that's fine, but I didn't enjoy it very much."
3,"great movie, unexpected problem","I bought this for a friend who really loved the movie. We wanted to watch it one night, and the blu ray player was in the other room, so we hooked my computer up to the television with an HDMI cord. However, the DVD copy would not play on my computer. Apparently a lot of new DVDs don't play on computer because of copyright issues. I was disappointed."
2,kept skipping,I tried to watch this the other day and the video kept skipping chapters and froze. this really frustrated me because i had been dying to see this movie but the disc had some issues
3,Action Movie for the Younger Viewer,This movie has almost non-stop action from beginning to end; something dramatic is happening all the time. It has a lot of visual stimulation and may entertain younger children who enjoy action and adventure. I was able to watch it all the way through as I was mildly curious how it was going to end. When we got to the sort-of end it was evident that there was a sequel in mind.It may be better to rent before you buy and see just what you think of it.
4,Standard Spielberg Entertainment,"""Tintin"" is in many ways a very good movie. The animation is breathtakingly beautiful, and just stunning to watch. The plot and the characters are a major improvement from the original Herge version. But I just wonder if Tintin is really a good big screen concept.Don't get me wrong. I loved the comic series, and thought even the television cartoons quite good. But there was always a careless innocence to Tintin, and Hollywood isn't really good with things with careless innocence.This is standard Spielberg entertainment. You go, you watch it, and you find it entertaining -- but it's certainly not a movie you'll get excited over, and recommend to your friends."
2,A bad interpretation of a classic teenage comic that explores the world.,"This interpretation on screen of Tintin, lacks the soul and depth of characters that Herge created as artist. When I read the books, I got a different picture of tintin's characters, Haddock's melodramatics. Tintin does one thing to you - it unifies you with a vision of world that Herge created, and teaches you to respect cultures and nations.Screen adaptation has a mellowed Haddock with passion, a tintin that is too serious for an adventure, and a story that is at heart of Tintin's adventure - ruined by slapstick stunts rather than being enamored by tintin's quick wits and Haddock's silly antics.In case, however, you have not been introduced to tintin through herge's picture books, please bear in mind you are watching a mindless stunt show, rather than being properly introduced to tintin."
4,Only went because my kids....,"wanted to go. I was really unsure about it, but in the end was very happy with it. It was like a animated Indiana Jones; lots of action, interesting plots and great characters. Great family night movie for kids and adults, or even just for adults."
3,Surprisingly hollow for a Spielberg film.,"After seeing the movie, I couldn't quite place my finger on why I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. And then it hit me: Tintin is a boring character. Sure, he goes on a lot of adventures, but he gets absolutely zero development. He's just a pawn for the filmmakers. In the end, I found myself not caring what happened to him.I used to watch the HBO animated series back in the '90s but don't know the character very well. Has he always been a walking void?"
3,TINTINITES WILL LOVE IT,"Having never been exposed to the Tintin books or TV series, I approached this movie merely on its pedigree and the trailer. Like many of Spielberg and Peter Jackson films, TINTIN is a big, action-oriented adventure, an animated Indiana Jones of sorts.Motion performance animation is a strange experience, a cross between cartoons and real-life characters. As expected, the production is flawless, the action scenes well-executed and the voice characterizations well chosen. Unfortunately, the movie felt more like an assault of the senses, almost like there was too much going on and for too long. I just expected a little more humor and less swashbuckling. I'm sure audiences with knowledge of the source material found it more enjoyable."
5,Love it,"Very good movie could watch it many times,will have my granddaughter watch it with me.Many good movies on Amazon love it."
5,Well worth the watch!,Very entertaining! Awesome animation! Great story! It felt as if I was watching a live action movie! If you are into animated movies you should definitely watch this one.
5,Tin TIn the movie,I enjoyed the movie very much. I saw it later on large screen and was impressed to remember how clear it was on the Kindle Fire. I like being able to watch new movies without having to buy them without reveiwing them.
3,Loved the animation.,"I really loved the beautifully animated characters, but the story seemed choppy and slow. I don't think kids would really like this movie."
3,Tin-Tin,"Stunning and fast moving, this movie really takes off. It captures the characters well but I have to admit it was a Sunday paper cartoon that I vaguely remember and seeing it didn't jog much memory. Still, I will get a chance to watch it as much as I like and perhaps I will see much more that I may have missed on the first viewing. I do feel this movie is directed at a younger audience between 10 and 15 years of age."
4,I grew up on Tintin,"And this came close. It owes a lot to the books with the references and plot points it takes, but - while the sequences are exciting - it over complicates the original artwork."
2,Not very entertaining,"I got bored watching the movie. The animation is superb, but the movie itself was just too difficult to get through."
4,Good movie till it ends,This movie had me on the edge of my seat.....until it ended. Everything about it has been masterfully done but the end left a lot to be desired. I hope that they make a 2nd one so the adventures can continue.
4,Tin Tin 3-D,The movie was very good but the 3-D effects were not as good as some other movies I have seen.
4,Good,This is a great animation quality. Its a nice story. My husbands from Europe and he remember Tin Tin as a child.
2,tedious,"Tedious, too long, could have ended at several points and should have...just not very imaginative, should have been true to the original cartooning rather than 'humanoid' figures"
2,To each their own,"It's OK. I was led to believe by the reviews that this movie was going to be better than it was. Off the charts animation, but the story was just OK."
2,meh,Grew up on Tin-Tin books... this is mediocre at best. Glad that I didn't see this in theaters. Three more words to fills this.. don't bother.
3,"Beautiful animation, ho-hum story....","The animation is cool to look at, but the story (and it stays true to he comic and other earlier animations) is too much and boring. Im a huge animation fan and added to my collection, but I'll probably only put it on again just as background noise."
2,metaphor alert!!!!,"So, what do you get when you cross Indiana Jones with Jack Sparrow and have the result read a little Gilbert & Sullivan? Then throw in a little Bolt.Ta-da!!---- Tin Tin!!!Nice specials, so two stars instead of one, but that's about it. I've never fallen asleep at an animated movie before, let alone an actions one. Mr. Spielberg should feel honored. Deeply honored."
1,Aweful!,"Too violent and lacking any kind of character. Couldn't get past the first 15 mins or so. Bland, harsh, eye-candy... seems the norm of late."
1,hardly anything to do with actual book,much of the plot has changed in this movie for the worse. it has barely anything to do with the actual comic. dumb movie not worth youre $
4,Good movie if you keep up with the Tin Tin Series!,Tin Tin was very entertaining! Kept me interested the whole way through. Can't wait to see the next Tin Tin!!!
3,Dog was best part,The animation and voice acting were great. But both my wife and I lost interest in several parts. Didn't really care for the stereotype drunk Russian (and no I am not Russian). Not sure if a drunk character is really appropriate for children.The dog was the best part.
3,fun,looking forward to really getting to watch it uninterrupted some time soon. the three stars is just my guess for now
2,A bit of a disappointment,We selected this movie because we thought it would be something we both could watch. It turned out to be too juvenile for us. Recommend for younger audience.
4,Take your kids and close your eyes,"It was fun and delightful with some really exquisite CG at certain points. Fun for the whole family though fans of the original Tin Tins may find their childhood hero ruined to better suit a younger generation. But you really only remember the good things about it. Although for some reason Tintin's face freaked me out a bit the entire time. Just disturbed me but don't know why. But eh, good movie for the whole family in some non-bloody cartoon violence."
3,Fun but nothing special,I enjoyed the stoty but didn't see anything particularly exceptional about it. The animation is wonderful. It's worht a rental more than a purchase.
1,Streaming sucks on kindle fire,"So I only had a short window of time to watch this movie. and for some reason, streaming wasn't working on my kindle fire. so frustrating and a waste of time."
1,This movie's 3d was terrible and a waste of my money,Purchasing this movie was a waste of my money. The 3d was terrible and I could have watched it without the glasses. Don't waste your money.
1,very boring movie...,rented this movie because two of the great directors are directing this and because i am a big fan of computer animated movies. the beginning is boring and i stop watching at 30mins into the movie. very boring movie. this is the first movie in a long time that i have stop watching. ive always manage to finish a movie and give it a fair review but this movie is just awful and boring.
1,dont buy digital copy!!!! does not work with itunes,"My family is on a roadtrip and all i wanted was for them to get a surprise movie on the ipad. I went to Amazon and then thought, gee I would like the DVD, too. This is a big mistake. First of all, I should I have guessed it was going to be a be hassle because there was no description in the product details about the actual digital copy. I assumed it was through amazon. You have to sign up/create an account on not one but two websites to finally get your movie. And the best part - even thought it says right on the DVD - works with itunes, it does not!!!!!! You have to download an application to actually get your movie and at that point find out you cannot put it in Itunes (even though it says you can) hoping to get my money back!"
1,Horrible for little kids,"Violence, story they can't follow. Waste of money. Will not be buying this movie now, or in the future ever."
1,Amazon streaming sucks,Amazon charged me for this movie. Could not watch it as all it did was buffer all the time and freeze. Streaming was very poor and would not recommend amazon for movies. I also have Netflix. streaming is AWESOME and no buffering or freezing. will not rent anymore from amazon as they still charged me for movie.I think they need an upgrade.
2,Storyline could have been better,"Great animation, cheesy storyline. The story could have been written better. Some of the characters were annoying and made it hard to watch all the way through. I couldn't finish it to the end."
2,Just alright and mainly for fans of Tintin or kids,Fairly mediocre and Tintin has the annoying quality where he has to narrate the whole story to the audience as it's occuring (just in case you were too stupid to understand). Obviously this is a children's movie but even as a kid I would have felt insulted.The story is pretty standard and the animation is fairly nice but probably not worth your time watching unless you're a fan of Tintin.
3,"Colorful, But Too Long","Steven Spielberg directed this animated film about Tintin, a young reporter who enters a world of adventure on the high seas in the middle of a rather implausible inter-generational battle between good and evil. Tintin and his very intelligent dog Snowy become involved in the mystery when Tintin buys a seemingly innocuous ship model. He's immediately accosted by two others who also want the model, and after taking it home, it's stolen. Fortunately, before that a secret scroll falls out after Snowy accidentally knocks the boat over, breaking the main mast in which it is hidden. However, it soon becomes clear that Tintin's scroll contains only part of a set of clues. And so Tintin and Snowy are soon off to find the rest of the clues.The 'bad news' is that the film is too long and violates far too many laws of physics."
3,It is a little violent,"Tintin was a very good movie, but it had too much violence with guns and swords. It was a good mystery, but grownups should watch the movie first to see if it is to violent for their kids."
2,"Once again, great animation and poor storytelling","I have found this to be a common theme among most of the computer animated movies nowadays. Speilbergs TinTin is no exeption. Here we have some of the most stunning animation ever put on film that is frustratingly wasted on a mediocre story. I found the whole expeirence to be a confusing mess. There were never any genuinely funny moments, (though it tries and flops), and the over use of action sequences just became tedious after a while. Its amazing that a master storyteller like Steven Speiberg could deliver to misfires in one year, War Horse being the other."
1,"Lead Me Not To Temptation, And Deliver Me From This Movie","Can't sleep?Then just watch this movie.While the implementation of the movie was good (the 3D technology, graphics, etc.), the storyline sucked. No really, it sucked ad nausea.Me and my entire family went to sleep during our first viewing of this movie in our 3D home theater.But we did notice something from the repeated theme throughout the movie before the last person awake went to sleep: that the Dog is the real hero! They should have named the movie after the mutt!! And he just ""aint"" good as Rin-Tin-Tin either.If there was a rating LESS than 1 STAR, I would rate it as 3-D:Dumb Storyline;Disillusioned Screenplay, and;Dissuaded from buying another Spielberg movie.Steve Spielberg, I just made a brown bag and placed your name on it. The bag has two eye holes so I can see out while cautiously--VERY CAUTIOUSLY--buying your next movie.Take Care,...GhillieMan"
2,Wait for TV Release,"When your 12-year-old niece asks you, ""What was the movie about?"" you can pretty well guess that this film was not worth the money.I enjoyed the action sequences, the animation, and the basic story, but it was waaaaaaaaaaay too long. The best part of the film for me was the major action sequence towards the end of the movie...but, having to sit through two hours to get to that point, it wasn't enough action/story/animation to win me over. Having seen it in the non-3D format, I'm guessing that the major saving point of the film for others may have BEEN the 3D (and truthfully, the ""loveable"" drunk captain was an embarrassment to watch with my niece and nephew).Plop in the DVD of ""Percy Jackson and the Lightening Thief"" if you want to give the kids a good action/adventure/story to watch. I'd seriously wait for the television release of this movie, at least you could fast-forward to the good parts."
3,Adult or Kid?,"It was an okay movie, made for kids, but made for their parents or visa versa. Failed for both but not miserably."
4,Fun,Fun movie - nothing special - nice escape. Enjoyed the simple story and the animation. Hope there is a sequel.
3,Could have been better,"I do not know much about The Adventures of Tintin the series.I purchased the movie mainly for the 3-d effect,I did not care much for the story,I did beleive the movie would have been better than it was,also the 3-d could have been better,it was okay though."
3,"Lots of action, but not a lot of charm","I'm a Tintin fan since 1967 when I bought my first Tintin book. Having read the reviews of the movie I knew what to expect, and I got it. Professional production, excellent animation, but not so much humour or charm."
5,I think I found a new genre to admire,"I will tell you what I don't like about this album! ""Having to decide which 'Sergio Mendes & Brasil 66' album to get!The music is upbeat and very lounge-ish. I love it!Don't waste time, order it today!"
3,"Possibly great product, but poor delivery","Ok. I believe in the flow and I like doing this visualization. However, the biggest problem is that Summer forgets that she is not talking to a radio audience. ""Dead Air"" is ok when doing a visualization. She would make her product much more usuable if she put a little more thought into the delivery. I can deal with the speed of her voice, but others might not be able to. I have been to the flow in an OBE, so I have no trouble imagining it. I will buy other products of hers. Just be aware that her delivery may be way too fast."
3,Native Son,"I give this book three stars. I think that Richard Wright wrote it very well and I'm not a big reader but this is just a book full of suspence, I never felt the need to stop reading! My 10th grade English teacher gave this book to us as an assignment and I really enjoyed it. However the book was filled with racism and the murders in the novel were very discusting, full detail! But I would deffinatley recommend this story to anybody who likes to read a good book!"
2,Jarretts Native Son reveiw.,"This book native son was a very suspensful book. Yeah that was about it, This book was writen by an author with some obviously serious race issues. I give this book two stars, one because it was well written, and the second because it kept me on the edge of my seat with suspense. Other than that this book was a total disgust to me, and I am half black, I do not recomend this book, Richard Wright is a pig racist, I do not understand why there has to be people like him in this world. I hope nobody takes offence to this articl but its just that I hate it when people choose to read a book, because of the constant race bashing in them. If people continue to read books like this there will never be peace among races, hell we might as well start killing eachother now."
5,just what I wanted,"My grandaughter's book from school was in such bad shape,I got this one and it's in much better shape, it is a big help."
1,Amazon does not sell the 2009 version of this text,"Amazon needs to offer current versions of texts, which are subject to change as new scientific breakthroughs are made."
2,What is it with Britannica?,"I have been a print user since high school (25 years) and a CD/DVD user since the 1997 version. What is it with this company? Every year they change the interface, but each edition is hopeless in many new ways! Can't they ever get this right? It's almost like the software is incredibly dumbed down so that literate people will prefer the print version. And they are utterly unresponsive when you complain.Nevertheless, you have to buy a copy every couple of years because, well, there is only one Britannica! No Encarta is ever going to have the scholarly content I'm looking for. But I'm sticking with DVD 2002 for now, even though it has other flaws (dvd can't install to hard drive, etc). No need to ""upgrade"" to another set of mistakes this year."
5,Fobus roto paddle,"This is a great holster. It fits both of my Springfield XM pistols (9mm and .45) as well as my Sig Pro 2022. It adjusts to different angles, and the tightness is adjustable as well. It also has a nice smooth draw which was usefull at handgun training classes at Front Sight training."
5,Choral conducting essential!,"A great, funny, witty self-deprecating book. Bill is fantastic in person, and ALMOST as enjoyable AND helpful in print.I've given this book as a graduation present to my conducting students for several years now. Timeless, practical wisdom on our choral art.There are books that are more ""academic,"" there are books that are more technical and exhaustive, but none as real, as funny, as practical, and as helpful. I can't wait for a sequel . . . get on it, Bill!"
2,Not for this cat,"This may be a good tool but definitely not for my cat... She is a long hair and really does not tolerate very much when it comes to grooming. I find this tool to be a bit rough for ""her""."
2,Girls of Island of Paradise Taiwan,"I got screwed badly. The quality of the picture is very bad. And film making strategy is very poor, who wanted to see all those photographers shooter?. Where the nakedness as advertise? I'm very very disappointed!!! Last words for you ""DON'T WASTED YOUR MONEY."""
2,"good, but...","this movie is okay.I think its nice, but i think ill stick with the 1993 version with kate maberly . The girl who played MARY LENNOX was annoying.COLIN was horrible ! And so was DICKON. The story is all messed up. COLIN and MARY were supposed to be cousins,they were not supposed to be married at the end , and DICKON ...it was horrible that he had to be dead.What most annoyed me,was the girl who played MARY.She was terrible.The story, i would give it a 4 ,the actors (wich i didnt like)i would give them no stars if possible."
4,A better release,"Having read the slim story and seeing all film versions, I am inclined to think this the best.It is not in the least important how the childhood characters did not look like the adult characters. In theater and film you are bound by constraints. Are you going to make the film or wait for some future incarnation of the child lead who would appear to be the same as an adult? Nope.Gennie James came across as a spoiled and petulant child. Her performance made me look away at times and grind my teeth. Barret Oliver was magical. As a charming and sad child he gave the strong impression of being prescient. This sets things up for the inevitable longing and sorrow that follows.We dismiss the emotions of childhood because we believe that they cannot compare to our own vast warehouse of sadness and dreams lost. This film perhaps can correct this misperception."
3,Secret Garden,"I'm a fan of the English actor Colin Firth, so I bought this film. He makes a very short appearence at the end of the movie, and thats all. The movie is sweet, Colins appearence way too short."
3,"Good story and filming, not good acting","I have always loved the story of The Secret Garden. I have seen the 1949 Margaret O'Brien movie, the 1993 movie with Kate Maberly, and a version done for the BBC in the 70's or 80's. All were very good. This one, however, is not so good. It is the most faithful to Frances Hodgson Burnett's story, but it doesn't give you the uplifting feeling that the book and other movies do. Gennie James is downright annoying as Mary, and I hated that the writer and director portrayed Dickon as a mystic who knows the future. THe location filming is very well-done, the story is great, but most of the actors didn't do a good job. Not a version of this great story to be remembered."
5,The best version of this movie,"I loved this movie as a girl and I was so excited to share it with my daughters. I think I have seen nearly every version of this movie and this one sticks closest to the book. My girls were both enchanted with the characters, especially Dickon and the animals. Mary is an amazingly sour child and we all loved watching her bloom."
1,Horror Garden,"This film was creepy and unnecessarily dramatic. It does not follow the novel accurately, and the ""artistic liberty"" taken by the director ruins the beauty and joy of the original story. The background music is dramatic to the point of being ridiculous, much of the lighting is dark, and the overall feeling is that of a horror movie. My eight-year-old, fairly tolerant of spooky stories and movies, did not like it and we did not finish watching it. My husband and I just thought it was stupid. If you've read the book recently, you'll find this film version disappointing."
1,"Great Story, Awful Acting.","While a wonderful story, this movie ruins it with two child actors who make the movie painful to watch.A bit hard to understand why the child of two English parents would speak like she's from New Jersey!I couldn't watch the end of this it was so bad.Recommend you see another version."
1,Worset movie ever,"I can't stand this movie, it's one of the worset.The acting is horrible, it's dark, gloomy, and so boring.It's fun to watch and make fun of it, but thats about all. I do not recommend it, I would give it zero stars if it was possible.The child actress ""mary"" and then the older grown up ""mary"" actress isn't suitable, she doesn't even look like she could have been the same person or type, how awful!Watch another version, this one is a waste of time and money!!"
5,Hallmarks The Secret Garden (1987),"After reading The Secret Garden by F.H. Burnett for the the first time as an adult I viewed all English versions of the movie. By far the Hallmark 1987 version of The Secret Garden is my favorite. What a charming cast of character actors, enchanting cinematography, and splendid music. I give this version of The Secret Garden two thumbs up. More thumbs if I had them. CMM 12-08"
1,This Video Deserves -0 Stars,"I know that some people read these reviews, but decide to find things out for themselves. Trust me. DO NOT buy this movie. It is terrible. This is truthfully the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting is dreadful and the changes made to the plot completely destroy the original meaning of the film. If you are looking for something similar to the book, try the Kate Maberly version. That one is, in my opinion, by far the best. Please, don't waste your money on such a pitiful excuse for a movie."
5,Le Jardin Secret / The Secret Garden,"J'aimerais bien me procurer le film en vidéo , Hallmark Hall of Fame, Le Jardin Secret version franaise, qui a été fait en 1987 . Merci de votre collaboration.Louise Lepitre"
1,did the writer even read the book,I don't know who wrote this movie but it has nothing to do with the book. Only in the beginning did it even resemble the orginal story. but after that it went down hill. they changed everything. First by making Mary and Colin not cousins was wrong and then at the end to add things to it that weren't in the book. First of all the story ended after Mr. craven discovered his son could walk and the garden was reopened but in this movie they had to add what they thought would happen when they children grew up. If you are going to that at least it should have been Mary engaged to Dickon instead of Colin. especially since they were cousins and it seemed like Mary had a little crush on Dickon. so my advise is if you want a copy of this movie check out the other ones or do not read the book.
5,BoRn ToO MaCk,This movie was tight! It has all of TOO $HORTS Classic music videos and some new ones too. The funny part in this movie is if you look at his teeth back then they were screwed and now if you look at them they are staight. Plus this video also features too short rappin with a little kid! if your a real too short fan check dis out.
2,"Too $hort Most Dangerous Videos, Most Censored BS","The videos are done old school Too $hort style, too bad this DVD censored so much of his lyrics. It just isn't the same, didn't say anything about censored content on the disc, but if I were you I'd pass on this one."
4,Korean mink blanket,"It is a beautiful blanket, but not quite what I bought in Korea. It is single layered and not for a king size bed. The wife likes it so I guess it stays. It really is a beautiful blanket."
5,OHH MY!,"This blanket is beautiful. It's soft, thick and heavy! Very warm, plush, cozy! Warms you up in a few minutes. Now I am addicted to these blankets! Hurry up and get yours before I buy them all!!!!!"
4,A mystery for cat lovers,"What if you won a prize to stay in a castle for a weekend? This is what happens to Mandy Hope. As Mandy, her parents, and her friend James arrive at the castle, they see a lot of cat decorations. There is something with a cat on it everywhere.On the very first day, when they got their rooms, Mandy and James see something ginger run under the bed. The two of them think it's a cat and start to look to see what they can find.When asked, Mrs. Hapgood, the owner of the castle insists that there are ""no cats around"" and she would like to keep it like that.That night Mandy has trouble going to sleep and there, in the soft moonlight, she sees a ginger cat with big glowing eyes.Grab this book and solve the mystery along with Mandy, James and a helpful ghost named Joe."
3,Summarization with explaination,"The narration in the beginning was good but the adept did not care to summarize the greater and lesser keys of Solomon. THerefore, the dvd was not informative. THe adept should have explained the different seals and how they are used and also,the different domains and how they are used in the magical experiments.I would prefer if this dvd had different series with each one having a text book approach to the series."
3,Informative but not spectacular...,"I have bought this video tape with great expectations.Hoever, I have been partially let down because of the actual invocation.The tape describes the history,some rational and philosophy behing Western Ceremonial Magick and gives a documentary of an actual ritual from the insides of a temple.The details are all there and complement the book greatly.So far so good...However if you expect to see actual results(that is spirits acquiring a physical form) you shall be dissapointed.Buy it for the info,and that only."
2,confusing,I have read the first part of this book and find it difficult to understand. The author takes for granted that the reader knows who or what he is talking about. Well that is not always the case. Although interesting it is also a very confusing book.
3,Orphen - The Perfect Collection,"This was not bad. It took awhile to get into the story, the last few episodes make up for it. The animation is not to bad but if you like magic and adventure. This will not disappoint you. If you are dragon fan the animation of the dragon will, I know i was. If you can forgive that then this collection will be enjoyable."
4,Classic Wizards & Warriors Series,"By today's steep animation standards, Orphen looks a little dated. However, one should notice the care and attention to many details the animators used despite the absence of computer modified animation. The characters are likeable and well portrayed. Though there are issues and flaws, many of these are minor and easily overlooked. The story is engaging and full of surprises. Of particular note: the two trolls who seem to always cause Orphen a ton of trouble are wonderful comedic additions.The anime gets high marks for fun, action, and characterization. Lower marks due to some inconsistency in the story and plot, as well as merely average voice acting.Overall this is a worthy, classic anime addition to any library.Viewing Preference: English Dubbed"
1,Don't buy,"Orphen stinks!!! For someone who does not know Japanese, this anime is not worth the time and money, even for someone who likes magical and sword fighting animes. First, the plot sucks. Second, the dubbing does not match the subtitle. And third, the character's (especially, Orphen and his crew) names change often.If you are not a Japanese speaker, don't buy Orphen because you will not be able to understand this anime."
3,"Nothing ground-breaking, but still fun to listen to","The basic rhythms of Regheb Alama's Saharony Elleil are the ancient sounds of traditional Lebanese music. However, the instrumentation and tone is up-beat pop. The album melds near-eastern sensibilities with Spanish flair. Zills create a soft percussion and flamenco-styled guitar flourishes provide a bit of pizazz.The keyboards will sound cheesy to most western listeners, but the presets seem to be all the rage in mid- and near-eastern pop music.The CD includes a music video playable on most computer platforms. Ragheb Alama pleads with a beautiful, miffed woman in the title track and brings along some computer-generated belly-dancing animals to help out. Of course she can't resist his song and the anthropomorphic dancers, so she ends up dancing, too.In my opinion, the strongest pieces are the most upbeat ones, like the title track. The slower songs just don't make me want to dance. Maybe they need belly-dancing bears and mice, too."
4,Interesting comic,"I enjoyed the story very much I liked the writers take on harley Quinn, however the art work is lame but the story is good. the author goes into great detail which makes it hard to follow at times but this is definitely a good comic"
2,DON'T USE TO SUPPLEMENT CURRICULUM READING!,"If you look to utilize this DVD to supplement curriculum, to make the production of the same ""come to life"" for your lackluster reader, DO NOT USE THIS VERSION OF THE DVD (1927). I love silent films, but for many boys AND girls who are reviewing the book for curriculum, it just won't cut the mustard! You would be better off having them do their own production."
2,Uncle Tom's Cabin,This is not the version that I thought it would be. Old-time film with no talking. I only watched the first 10 minutes. I had ordered it to show to my history class. It was not what I was looking for. Those who are into old-time movies without words may appreciate it.
5,American folk poet,"Will Ferrell was my grandfather. He worked 8 hours a day, 7 days a week and still wrote poetry. These poems have been a part of my life. Triangle was written when my mother was born. I think that they're as good as any other American poet."
1,not for us,"i bought this for the sweet 16 month old i babysit, thinking educationally. i'm just not ready to teach him that ""f"" is for ""ffftt"" (fart), ""s"" is for splat, when the bird poops, and ""x"" is when the bird dies."
5,lil bit crude but cute =),"this sooooo funny. my boys and i love this book. B is for burp, etc not for the sensitive natured prissys. We think its fun & funny! :-p"
5,Ha ha funny!,"This book is hilarious. My students loved it, especially the fart for letter ""f"". I wish they would make the book larger though."
3,"history,or opinion?","There seems to have been a lot of research done for this book, but I was concerned about the a factual omission in this book, Juzaburo Sakamaki was a pivotal person in this book, but the listing of his children was inaccurate, his youngest daughter was not mentioned. If this detail was wrong, what other facts were left out?"
3,This book is just ok,This book tell the story of how the Oklahoma bombing affected the life of Terry Nichol's son. It is an ok read. If you are looking for a book about the victim's and what happened on that horrible day this is not the one to read.If you are looking for a book that tell's you how Terry has affect his family then this is a good read. His ex-wife is very honest in the writings of this book.
2,Quickie book cashes in,"There's not much worth reading here. It's a badly written, uninformative book that tries to paint the ""as told to"" author, Terry Nichols' ex-wife, as an insider on the case. If anything, you feel sorry for Nichols throughout as Padilla attempts to aggrandize her role and to make statements without basis in fact."
3,This book is worth buying,This book is very interesting and allows those of us who are interested in the McVeigh-Nichols saga to see how the bombing affected some of their family members. The only downfall - the book stops short of the trial. I hope Lana Padilla someday writes a second book.
1,trying too hard,not that good becuase it seems like the musical genius of 80's style jazz noise and miles davis electric decadence is trying to cash in on the jam band scene with some hippied-out neo-psychadelic smooth jazz.
4,Is this jazz? Does it matter?,"I first heard this disc cranking loud in a music store that caters to the studded leather 20-ish crowd who listen to Korn and make the annual pilgrimage to Ozzfest. The clientele and the employees in the store were all groovin' to the funky beat. I start bopping along to, then all of sudden I think, ""Wait a minute, I recognize that guitar. That's John Scofield! What the heck are these kids doing listening to JAZZ?"" Then I thought, ""They don't even know it's jazz. They all think it's some kind of new heavy metal."" And they're right. That's how hard it is to categorize this recording. But it doesn't matter. Uberjam kicks booty. Next thing you know, those kids will be checking out Bitch's Brew and thinking they've discovered new music. And they'll be right."
5,From the Back Cover:,"This book is the definitive book on the sport of kings, covering EVERYTHING that happens in the stables, on the track, and at the betting windows. From the great horses of the past to a comparison of handicapping systems, from naming horses to evaluating them, from the auction ring to the training ring, from the classic races to how to read the Daily Racing Forms, it's all here in one fascinating, exciting, and useful book."
3,Fangtastic,"Erica Cox is absolutely stunning in this film. The plot is thin, but her sultry looks are well worth this lightly funny, sexy vampire horror film.Jack (Jason Mewes)a paramedic finds Danika (Erica Cox) passed out near his house. He takes her in. She's been bitten. He looks after her, her vampireness begins to assert itself. She goes through a couple of options (animal, blood donor bag, etc.) but finds she can only stomach fresh warm blood. So that's what she does. That's pretty much it. There's holes in the plot such as why Jack takes her to his apartment, and not to hospital. And why he accepts her vampirism at first - probably because she's so hotDid I say Erica Cox is sexy?"
2,Falls short,"A horror/comedy which tries to give itself deeper meaning by playing up the emotional factor. Mewes' acting isn't up to par for a proper film. The script draws out the characters in broad strokes, making them superficial. Erica Cox is hot enough but her short skirts can't save it. In the end, it felt more like a bunch of friends wanking off than someone trying to make a real movie. I understand this is supposed to be a fun flick, but it still isn't a good one. Watch ""Let The Right One In"" instead."
3,Sexy!,Good film. Solid performances. Erica Cox is perfect as a female suductress vampire. I recommend this film for any one between the ages 16-28.
1,Not up to par,I am a big vamp fan but this movie put me to sleep. Not up to par with anything else I have ordered.
1,not the best movie ever made..,"the story is kind of dumb, there is no story about the girl becoming a vampire, people disappearing and no one says anything about it, the ending is just silly.. do not waste your money or time."
5,perfect choice...all good in the hood,"i would buy again, they've been nothing but perfect from the start.the wattage rating was higher than most i'd viewed and was priced better also.i don't think there's anything wrong with the sound or the quality of the speaker."
2,Pyle PLMRSK,"I didn't like this set at all. The tweeters that come with it does not fit into the stand. I called the company rep and they said to reorder, which I did. When the second order arrived, it was the same. I would not buy.I c"
2,Nothing Here,"The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World for Grown-Ups is a decent idea but fails to provide much value. It's far too short to be a comprehensive guide, yet it fails to offer much content that is both unique and useful enough to justify its price. If you were to buy theThe Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 2008 (Unofficial Guides), you will get a book that dwarfs this one in size and usefulness. Quite frankly, nearly all of the information presented here is available in the main volume but the reverse is certainly not true. This book can only scratch the surface compared to the full guide. Even though I love the Unofficial Guide series, I can't recommend this one."
1,Just buy the standard Unofficial Guide,"This book is not really worth buying. I hadn't been to Disney World in many years, and was planning my first trip as an adult (with my friends) and thought that this book would be useful as a supplement to the standard Unofficial Guide. If you just buy this guide for Adults, it is missing a lot of the robust information that is in the Unofficial Guide, so you don't get a lot of the advice and detail that you get in the standard book. Instead, this basically just has summaries of what is in the standard guide -- it doesn't even have any new, unique information. This was a waste of money."
1,bait & switch,"We purchased this product after viewing the image online, but received an entirely different product from the company. The image online shows a 4 square waffle maker, with a supposedly a 4 circular pizzelle maker on reverse grids. We have not yet tried the product, but trying to contact the company about our concern has been really difficult. When going to the website, there is no company phone # listed. When trying to go to the customer service site, the computer has no data & cannot connect. After taking the time to locate a phone#, there has been no response other than a recorded menu. Every time ""2"" was pushed for customer service, no-one was available. Leaving a message was no easy task, and we have not heard back from the company.So, perhaps the product is OK, but trying to deal with the company is extremely frustating, so please be aware!"
2,Disappointing!,"There is a serious flaw in this DVD (Encyclopedia Britannica 2003 Ultimate Reference Suite): searched words are NOT highlighted in the articles that contain the word, nor is the word placed at the top of the article's window. One must scan through the article to find the search word - a very time consuming task. In addition, the interface consists of dull blue/grey colors, there are almost no web site references (World War II has no ""Online Content"" hits), the Knowledge Navigator is a joke, and the World Atlas stops at a map of the United States as a whole, without bringing up state maps. My summary: this edition is a serious disappointment."
2,Horrible Interface/Great content,"While the content may be great, the interface is a joke. The whole application is done 100% in Java. This has some very negative side effects. The worst problem is that the Java makes the entire interface extremely sluggish, even on a high end machine. Additionally, standard Windows interface features don't exist, like the ability to scroll text with the mouse wheel. Also, there are no configuration options whatsoever, except the ability to change the text size to one of three sizes. The font used is blurry. All fonts are my computer are crystal clear, but this one is blurry. Therefore, the only way to read the articles is to set the text size to medium. Also, the pictures tend to be too small. The interface itself is horrid comared to even MS Encarta 1995 edition, which is sad. That's too bad, because the content is head and shoulders above Encarta, and there is an article on just about everything you can imagine."
2,Encyclopedia Britannica 2003 Ultimate Reference Suite on DVD,This is not what I would expect from Britannica. It was very difficult to install. After several failed attempts I e-mailed tech support and described the problem. They never responded. I finally found a toll number to customer support. Called them. They sounded amateurish. After trying numerous fixes the guy told me I needed a file from Sun microsystems. He said he would e-mail the link to me. He never did. After another hour on Sun's site I found the correct download and installed it. None of this was documented. My machine is a recent (6 months) high end Dell.The interface with Britannica is poor and hard to navigate. This is unfortunate because the content is quite in depth; which is why I purchase it in the first place. I will certainly hesitate before purchasing another product from this company.
2,Worse than previous versions,"I've owned the 1999, 2001, and 2003 versions of the EB DVD. The 2001 was by far the best. While the content is wonderful in all three versions, only the 2001 edition provided any sort of ease of use. The 1999 version barely functioned, and the 2003 is a major step backward. As others have noted, it runs much slower, the scolling mouse function doesn't work, and the dictionary and article interfaces have been annoyingly combined. Also, the Atlas maps have not been greatly improved, which would have been really nice. The only major improvement in the 2003 EB-DVD is the pronunciation guide included in the dictionary. The superfluous student editions included on the DVD are worthless. My hope is that Britannica will build on strength and focus on improving content in subsequent versions."
4,essential early wailers,"For those who can not afford to get the 3 volume box set collection of the Wailers' pre- ""Catch a Fire"" material- including their late 60's sides- the essential recordings with Lee ""Scratch"" Perry- these cds will help you get more acclimated to these sides.Both cds offer alternate takes of many of these songs, which is a nice thing, so as to allow the listener to follow the evolution of the tracks. (Some, like Peter Tosh's ""400 Years,"" do not change much, while others, like Marley/Tosh's ""Concrete Jungle,"" change a lot)While not by any means a complete collection, these cds will be a good way to start listening to the evolution of reggae's most endearing band."
1,Not available,"Why is the Moroccan Red shown to be purchased and is not listed, not even an ""not available""?"
4,"Park B. Smith Plush Chenille 34-by-20-Inch Rug, Sapphire","Very thick, nice, and attractive. Difficult to keep clean looking (because it's dark), but still a great addition to our bathroom."
2,Falls apart,"I dont normally write reviews, but my disappointment with this product compels me. The rug looks and feels as expected, but as another review puts it ""does not hold up in the wash"". That is an understatement. It disintegrates in the wash, leaving balls of itself all over the place. Do not wash this with any other items, it will coat anything else in the machine with balls of colored fluff. By the second wash we had to throw it away, as many of its loops had simply fallen off. I consider this a low quality product, and one Amazon should not even list."
2,Don't buy this rug,"When I received this rug, there were wide spaces between some of the rows of the chenille. It also felt wierd to step on. Anyway, I used it for about 1 week and then threw it into the wash. That was the end of it. It basically fell apart."
3,black rug,"I love the rug, however, I should have purchased a different color. I bought the black one thinking it would hide all the dirt, etc. Unfortunately the black seems to highlight any speck of lint, etc. A quick vacuum makes it look great."
3,Looks Great But Didn't Hold Up in the Wash...,"These rugs looked fantastic when I opened them up and I was so pumped to find them in the color that I was redecorating my bathroom in. But the very next day my son started getting sick with a stomach virus and vomited all over them trying to make it to the toilet. I had to wash them of course. And that's when I saw their true colors, literally. The color didn't fade but white threads popped out througout each rug, and the quality appeared to have just diminished. :o( I'm still using them, after all, I'm stuck with them now. Maybe if you are so lucky to only have common soil and don't have the threat of a sick person these rugs could just be drycleaned. Then they would probably be fine."
4,Round Woman's Gold Cat Stainless Bracelet Watch,I bought this watch as a gift for a friend. It arrived in excellent condition in a very timely manner & my friend was just thrilled with it.
4,Eagle's Quest,I have wanted this book for months. I read other books by Fred Alan Wolf which briefly mentioned this one and what it was about. I am fascinated with ancient healing rituals and shamanism. This book looks at shamanism through the eyes of a physicist. I now want to read his next book.
1,old and unreliable,"I purchased this palm calc to speak to HVAC equipment, (Siemens software)still runs on DAS. Unfortunately the display screen only worked for 1 day of use, which is unfortunate enough, At which point I contacted the seller for return , which was granted, I lost about 21 hours of man time due to this which ads up to approximately 2600 dollars, And the seller now is trying to deny me my refund of the item After I sent it back! I dont think I will ever except another contract were Iam responsible for communications to do my job since most HVAC software is out dated and old electronics are unreliable the seller of this product is a con artist selling broken crap online than making false claims I hope Amazon sticks by there Gaurantee!"
1,"Heated O2 Sensor, great deal!",The sensor was damaged. The part had been sold/attempted to be installed. The threads were damaged making the part useless.
4,Boring after a while,This was a fun book. The only fault is that if you want to start a different game you have to start at the same place and have the same choices to make. It's fun at first but after you have it for a while it gets boring.
3,printing error -- now being corrected,"I have been enjoying this Christmas present, though I am only part way through -- a massive tome. However, I was startled to find at least one major problem in the printing, with several pages dropped and replaced by duplicates of others in the signature following the last set of plates (pp. 637 ff.). Another copy showed the same problem, so it is not just mine. Clearly, whoever was supposed to check imposition was asleep at the switch -- or maybe like that guy in the movie Elf he hoped no one would notice the missing pages. Some publishers would re-print rather than allow this sort of mistake to hit the storesLater addition: I now hear the printer is reprinting the run -- no small task. Meanwhile, I continue to read and enjoy the book. It was a gift from someone who knows I periodically re-read the Patrick O'Brian novels, and the interplay between historical fact and fiction is fun."
5,The Pursuit of Victory: The Life and Achievement of Horatio Nelson,"It is a very large book, so I have not finished it yet, after all I've only had it a few days.So far, an excellent read and seeming ly a very well researched look at Nelson.It is is about my tenth book on him and, so far, the best yet."
3,Praise for author - keelhaul the publisher!,"This 800-plus page book, painstakingly put together by its author is one of the worst copy-edited books I have ever seen. Additionally its binding is cheap and flimsy. There is no pagination of the charts it includes and the biographical sketches that could clarify much of the text are hopelessly out of order. It is another demonstration that slovenliness in publishing is acceptable."
3,Nice case with a few flaws,"The case is very sturdy and will definently keep your nano protected. However, the opening for the headphones is not large enough. I had to cut it larger so i could actually plug my headphones in all the way. Same for the opening at the top for the hold switch. Unless you have nails, you'll never be able to switch it on or off. I kept the case because I thought it ws really cute and liked how sturdy it is. If you're not willing to put up with problems with the openings, don't get this case."
2,not what I hoped,"This clip looks good, but not what I had hoped. I had to file the openings bigger to get ear phones to stay in. Hard to remove everytime you need to plug in, so filed the end off to have access for that as well. finally, the look is great, but the rubber too thick and you can't get your hands to work end buttons without a struggle. The fabric by the click wheel is not thick, so that gets bumped easily. I wouldn't spend the money again."
5,CRAZY CARS... I wish they had one in my size!,"We bought 2 of these for our boys... and they are AWESOME! My husband and I wish we could jump in them and bump into each other, as well. Too cool, for real! Our boys LOVE them and even my 1.5 yr. old is able to drive around. I didn't find them loud AT ALL (but then again I'm used to 2 boys) and they were pretty good for using in the concrete on the outside patio (I don't think I want to let them play inside the house with BUMPER cars). Too many things getting bumped over as it is already! ;) Definitely, would recommend!!!"
5,Tasteful 1987 Studio Session,"Generally understated session with outstanding support from: John Abercrombie, Peter Erskine, Marc Johnson and Steve Kujala.All songs are Ozone's originals:Watch What I'm Gonna DoMight As WellEndless Season Part IVThis Little Piggy Tells TimeYou Are In LoveAs IsPassage"
3,Meandering Non-fiction,"Thirty pages into this book, I wondered who was Mr. Sennott's target audience. For believers in the miracles associated with the Virgin of Guadalupe, he provides scant details and those are poorly organized. For Skeptics he fills far too many pages with silly and dull quotations from other skeptics without ever giving a unified or focused defense of the image's authenticity. The section on the Shroud is only slightly less frustrating.The problems may be with the editing. The chapters are too long and wander over many unrelated topics without a clear point. The reader cannot find what he does nor skip what he doesn't want to read."
5,best book about ozzy solo band,"this is a fantastic book if your into who what when and where info on ozzy's blizzard of ozz band,right from the beginning up to currant date.interviews with many ozzy band members from the past and a few uncredited by request reasons unknown.this book is a must for die hard ozzy fans who want to know the meat and potatoes of his solo band."
3,Not The usual Lutz,I found this book a bit dull for Lutz. Very predictable and hoakey. Really? The old guy does not always get the hot women!
2,Annoying,"I really wanted to like this book. I tried. Readers of the crime/mystery/suspense genre will most likely find themselves groaning in frustration. While the main character is somewhat likable, for an ex-cop cum P.I. he is CLUELESS. I'm so annoyed I can't even finish this review...Don't waste your time."
3,Potential Classic Marred by Poor Editing,"This book performs a valuable service to novice investors by explaining some of the realities of the stock market. Unfortunately, the poor editing makes the book awkward to read and unnecessarily hard to understand. If the publisher could do something about that before bringing out the next edition, the book could become a classic."
3,serves its purpose,I was satisfied with how it looked. It sits nicely on my desk. however the bulb it comes with does suck but this seems unimportant since bulbs are cheap. the new bulb does stick out a little but it doesn't affect usage.My major complaint is the switch is way town the cord which makes 0 sense since its supposed to sit on a desk. It just means you have to scrap around in the dark to find the switch.
4,"1967, here we come!","The authors give a lot of suggestions for beginning to work with collage and assemblage. Most of the illustrations are black-and-white photos of the authors' works, or from their unidentified students, and though there are a few b&w examples of Kurt Schwitters' work, this is more a work for playing. The samples are remarkably dated, but it has its charm, especially as a glimpse into a hip-mainstream mid-60s sensibility. The examples aren't intimidating, and the couple of pages of technique (e.g., supports, adhesives, paints & varnishes, tools) is enough get you going, though a trip to your local independent art store will be helpful to learn about the advancements in products over the past 40 years."
3,Not enough Twain,"I knew this was a compilation of stories by a number of authors but there were just a few written by Mark Twain and, given the title, I was expecting more Twain stories."
1,Piece of Junk,"I got this thing for Christmas. The DVD Player worked for about 3 months, then it started giving me error messages when trying to read the DVD's. It would work off and on. Then exactly a year later, it just quit working at all. This thing is a piece of garabage. I am now in the market for a DVD player again. I will never buy anything made by Toshiba. Not to mention the fact that my parents own a Toshiba TV and the sound quality is very poor. Toshiba sucks."
1,DVD door did not open at all,"I ordered one about 2 weeks back. Price was very attractive got it 108 - 20 (rebate) = 88 from amazon.Opened the player from the box and connected it. The DVD door would not open at all. The finish and material quality is also very poor. Returned it for a full refund from Amazon.Generally Toshiba is good but this is my second bad experience with Toshiba product. First being a defective brand new laptop. My friends have problems with their 27 "" Toshiba TVs too. Toshiba once even replaced the TV for free of charge....But I think they are not focussing on quality these days."
3,"Does its job, not much else","My VCR died and the kids needed a new one. I rushed out and bought a VCR at a local shop. Then I did some research online. Found this great deal on this model; and it was DVD & VCR to boot. It does what its job, but not much else - kind of sad in this price range.Some of my gripes include:~ When playing a DVD, the chapter does not show on the display.~ If in DVD mode, and you insert a VCR tape it doesn't switch automatically to VCR mode.~ The remote has no universal capabilities what so ever. I'd at least like to change the channel, volume, power to the TV with one remote.Overall, a good model that could be better for the price(...)."
2,Don't buy this combo,"I would suggest buying a different brand combo. This one makes noise when it is not playing but the unit is on. Also, you have to select ""Timer Record"" on the remote control or your timer will not record. Then it takes you into DVD mode until your program is on. Other models you just have to turn off and the timer will work. Also, the auto tracking is just terrible on this if it is a tape recorded on another vcr. Your have to use manual tracking and it doesn't get the picture right after doing that either. Plus the dvd doesn't always pick up where you left off if you stopped watching the dvd in the middle. Sometimes it starts back at the beginning."
1,"horrible, absolutely horrible","i dont mean to be a selfish customer,but when i get something this crappy, things are bound to get messy.pros:it came, but 6 weeks after i ordered itcons:bassicly everything.i got this for my 14 year old daughter for her tv because the last dvd player we had, broke. (we had it for 7 years)it came 6 weeks after i ordered it. it came in 3 peices. it was broken when we opened it. imanaged to get it fixed but it was as blurry as a 1970 video cassette player. i would say truthfully that is worth about 4$. seriously.half of the time it acted like there wasnt even a disk in there but we use those same dvds for our other dvd player. over all, just dont buy it. get a pet monkey instead. a monkey may cost more, but it will bring you a 1000 times more entertainment. even if it sleeps 23 hours a day. this product should be a negative rating."
3,AOK !!,I read all the negative reviews on this but also read similar negatives for other $100 DVD/VCR combo's. I ordered this because of the price and brand name. You can't beat the price! I saved the reciept and box expecting to return it but was pleasantly surprised. It works fine!! I have no complaints.
1,Avoid the Frustration,"I bought a Toshiba because of its supposed quality name. Unfortunately, I was led astray. The dvd/vcr 291 hummed and buzzed loudly when I hooked it up. Then, when I tried to record a tv program, the resulting picture rolled and jumped so much that no amount of adjusting would fix it. I returned it to Best Buy and they exchanged it for a Samsung, no questions asked.Besides the terrible recording, I struggled through the remote's instructions with its multitude of buttons. I'm no idiot, but after an hour trying to figure out which buttons did what, I began blathering like one.So, avoid this piece of junk."
2,If all you want to do is play movies,"A remote control that could launch a moon mission, when you only use 6 buttons 90% of the time. This unit also will not time-record onto tape unless you turn it on, and hit the timer record button, a step backward from most VCRs. Go back to look at your recording and forget to hit that button again and, oops, sorry. It also was not able to find UHF channels during timer record unless you set the channel memory, which means it only knows and shows you certain channels. Not a big deal, but if the VCR can find it directly, why couldn't the timer record w/o channel memory?On the positive side, it did work out of the box, it does play tapes and DVDs just like it should."
1,Don't Buy This,"This product worked for about a month. I still hadn't even figured out all the controls before the unit ""ate"" my dvd and half the controls don't work. You have to unplug it to switch from VCR to TV controls. This must have been a high school science experiment gone wrong."
1,BEWARE OF THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!.......,"When I bought it at the Bay ,the salesman gave me a good deal so I thought it would be convenient with it's commercial skip feature it would make it easy to record.But when I got it home I was having trouble because the vcr would not record at all and I can't burn cd's and dvd's when everything else works!.It was a total waste of my money!. And later on it died and I tried to get a refund but I wasn't able to do that now that my warnty was expired,so I just threw it away in the trash.What a disgrace!!.I recommend you don't purchase this product at all!!."
2,Not Friendly,"I ordered this combo because I wanted the commercial skip feature. Although I am quite computer and electronics savvy I found the controls to be impossible to use, not at all intuitive or user friendly. There are 46 buttons on the remote with obscure and complicated functions. Sitting with the instruction book in my lap, I attempted several times over a period of a week to program the VCR timer to record a program and was unable to accomplish the task."
2,Can't record ANYTHING!,"After two hours of attempting to record a simple TV show...any TV show...I gave up hope. The DVD plays fine. Mp3's, CD's and VCD's are also fine...however, it will not play SVCD's or DVD-R's burned from my PC. But the real drawback is the VCR recording function. No matter what I tried nothing would record to tape. Oh sure, the tape ""rec"" indicator said it was recording, but it wasn't. In fact, not only did it not record an image/sound/etc., it didn't even erase what was previously recorded on the tape and leave me with noise. NOTHING recorded. I took it back for a Samsung VCR/DVD combo. I suggest you do the same."
1,TWO broken ones,i ordered this player. the first one came. the dvd tray did not and would not open. I returned it. A second one came. the same thing happened.seems like an unreliable unit they are trying to get rid of.
4,Liquidfence or Deer away.,Liquidfence works as advertized. The deer that encroach on my property stayed away when I remembered to spray my roses and my pole beans every three weeks. The odor is not as offensive as one might think and disappears the day after spraying. Liquidfence was particularly effective on my black current bushes.
5,"Learn 1,000 new things!!!","This is an amazing book!! Every page expands what you thought you knew. How do they get that water up 100+ feet? Why are trees deciduous? (Better questions are how many ways they are deciduous, and why, and what does deciduous really mean anyway?) This will make any hike you take more interesting, any tree rings you inspect simply fascinating."
3,We All Wish....,"Millman doesn't believe ""the perfect sister"" exists, although she does describe a few who come very close. I found this book a curious mix of discussions about types of sisters (The Outsider Sister, The Wishful Sister)and lengthy biographies of families, rather than siblings. I wanted to read more about the sisters and less about the mothers and fathers who created them because, as the author admits, ""sisters play a huge role in our childhood and identities."""
2,Self-satisfied author,"I really wanted to like this book; however, after reading about halfway through, I've become disenchanted with her cutesy, self-satisfied triumphs. This book would be much more interesting if it contained photographs, illustrations or examples. As it is, the author gets carried away with her academic expertise and seems to me to be constantly showing off her knowledge. She doesn't sound depressed to me. Instead she brags about all her travels and awards and recognitions. This book was written for her own satisfaction with little regard for the reader. I'm sorry I bought it."
2,Get the original Nintendo Light Zapper instead,"Comes in gray or neon orange (not pictured)--I got the orange one through the luck of the draw. It is very cheaply made. It is compatible with the NES 8-bit system in the sense that it works with the games. But, it is a real struggle to get the plug into the connector to the point that you will think it will never happen. Humorously, the packaging indicated that it ""Come with 8ft Extension Cable"", but the cable on the gun is no more than 5 feet and there is no further extension to be had. Not a problem as I didn't buy it thinking there was an 8 foot cable, but it is indicative, perhaps, of the quality control used on the product within the package. It should also be noted that this product is not licensed by Nintendo. Not surprising as Nintendo has higher standards than this product exhibits. But, all told, it does let you shoot, elevating it just slightly out of the one star range."
1,Should've paid more attention to the reviews...,"Thought i ordered a ""Hyperkin"" zapper to begin with.. not ""YOBO."" Too cheap to be 'yolo.' That alone was dissapointing as is. I ended up ruining the controller port to my new Hyperkin Retron3 console(which rules btw), trying to plug it in. Massive buzzkill. Please, Dont buy this useless 'yobo' product."
1,Broke 1st use,The connection was very hard to fit into the Nintendo and then it broke the first time trying to remove it. Also it looked nothing like the picture. Very cheaply made and bright orange.
3,Nothing new here,"It still manages to be mildly entertaining, despite the tired plot, fairly flat characters, and hackneyed mystery. The dog-in-the-pocket was funny, as was the sensitive Mrs. Danvers (who was fired from a previous position for burning toast. They thought she was trying to set fire to the house). If you are looking for a romance novel with something different to offer, you proablably shouldn't start with Lip Service, but if you are lloking for a mildly entertaining diversion to last you a few hours, buy it used."
1,What A Mess!,"I was hard pressed to finish this book but perservered. I would have done better to toss it and find something more interesting to read.There was absolutely NO emotion by any of the characters in this book. The only reason the reader would know there was any was because the author said so.And the ending was so murky, it's a definite let down. Why had the villain plotted revenge for 30 years? For what? The tragic event took place more than 58 years before. How would that have affected the villain?I felt that a lot of pages got left somewhere. Jammed in a fax machine? Eaten by the author's dog? Don't know and don't care. If this is an example of Ms. Simmons work, I don't care to read anything else. This one goes to the used book store ASAP. Hopefully, to be traded for something worth reading.Save your money for a good book with a decent plot and real emotions."
2,When two-for-one is not a bargain,"This DVD comes with one feature and one short.Vampire Call Girls is a silly film. It is not surprising that it is an excuse to show topless women, but it makes little sense otherwise.[...] No consistency.The nude scenes are just that, with little or no action.Battle of the Colossal Women makes even less sense.[...]Both the battle and love scene between the two women are super staged and awkward. Both woman look like they want to look like they are trying to do something without actually touching; almost as if they are afraid of exceeding their contract.For simple visual pleasure, Vampires is the better piece, but both are worse than much of what you can find on cable and TV."
3,It's kinda corny but has it's good points.,"I thought the movie itself was kinda stupid. I thought most of the girls didn't even look like vamps excect Lilith Stabs, which was the only good point of the movie. Sure the other girls looked good but they looked out of place in a vampire movie. After seeing this movie I have to say I would recommend it if you wanted to see T&A and not much storyline cause the girls do look good but they can't act. My favoirte part was where Lilith told the bartender where to go."
4,What Great deal,Bought this so i could have some extra batterys for my camera. I'm happy with the performance of the batterys. Its a great deal for the money
3,good idea,but hard to clean that double blade without putting life and limb at risk. the rest is great
5,Buddhist Treasure,"Each successive volume of The Gateway to Knowledge is both easier to read and easier to understand. This volume is more accessible to serious students of Buddhist philosophy, than a casual reader of Buddhist books, especially if one has already plowed through the preceding two volumes of the text. It is a wonderful tool for study groups to read and discuss together.The translation of the text into English in this volume is the best of the first three volumes."
5,~Lovely To Display~,"I purchased a pair of the table top versions of this product in 2006. One of mine is a Springer Spaniel, the other is a Borzoi. I use mine for display purposes at my vendor booths for my business. The product is very attractive, finished with smooth edges and a nice weight to prevent them from easily falling over. The pair I own are also very nice representations of each breed's silhouette."
1,You Don't Get the Posters Pictured,I was upset when I got this poster set and saw that the two Garfield posters are not in it. You get an elementary poster about following directions and a poster about opening a door for students. It is false advertising and upsetting. They sent me two different orders and they were both the same posters. They need to change their picture to accurately show what you are getting.
4,Comfy camper,"This tent is great! I went out for a weekend with some friends, and we fit four in it - and three were full-grown guys. It rained, and we stayed dry, too. good deal!"
5,Muy Buena,"Excelente, la use un fin de semana en la playa, es muy comoda, buena ventilación, es muy espaciosa... Vale la pena"
1,NOT a genuine Royal HEPA filter...cheap replacement,The Amazon ad by this company pictures a Genuine Dirt Devil replacement part. What I actually received was a NON genuine pair of filters in a clear baggie with NO name and NO part number. I phoned Dirt Devil and they confirmed that the filters I received are not manufactured by Royal Dirt Devil and indicated that they probably aren't even genuine HEPA filters. I expect to receive exactly what is pictured in an ad.
2,"Typical Counterfeit product at retail price, but is it a HEPA filter? Who knows.","I was going to return this, but I complained to Dirt Devil's parent company and they didn't care. As a review of a counterfeit product this is ok. It fits in the vacuum and works. Is it a HEPA Filter? No idea. But, if I really wanted a HEPA Vacuum I wouldn't be using this bag less Dirt Devil that spews dust everywhere.People like to buy counterfeit products because they save a lot of money and trick their friends. But, when the buyer is being tricked, and is paying the full price, the situation is a little different."
1,Dirt devil knock off,"I ordered a dirt devil HEPA filter, but got a knock off one. The filter part had a sticky surface. The first time I used it the dust/dirt stuck to it and would not come off. In the trash can it went!"
4,Good price on a hard to find item.,"This item is so hard to find at even hardware or home improvement stores, let alone grocery stores. It was just what I was looking for and at a good price."
3,&#65533;I am Dracula&#65533;.,"I very much enjoyed this movie. My problem isn't the movie it self. It's the DVD transfer.I thought that they could have done a much better job, then what was represented.The reason I say that is because there are so many great ways they have now. So that they can clean up an old movie. Even something like Dracula and I could tell that they really didn't try to do so.Also the movie comes in a beautiful DVD package. However, I find it difficult to open.Not only that but the defects on both discs are rather annoying. I was disappointed that my computer got infected with the DVD for a while. So I had to restart it and start from were I was last off.I was kind of ticked off to because I was enjoying the movie very much.I almost hop that they will rerelease the movie to a better set.However, the movie it self was great to watch, and I really enjoyed it."
4,Good enough. I'm just not a big Dracula fan.,"For its time, it was a very good movie... It's a classic. I bought it because I'm into classic monster movies. Dracula though isn't at the top of my list. That space is for Frankenstein and the Wolfman."
5,THEY'RE NOT MADE LIKE THIS ANYMORE,"The classic Universal horror movies are a treasure. They didn't need gore & blood to scare people. Eerie music, the fog and the howling of the children of the night are wonderful. If you love the old classic horror films, get all the sets."
1,Dracula the Legacy Collection,"Do Not Buy this disc! I have gotten 3 of them & the 2nd disc has been scratched up EVERY TIME! the 3rd time I bought it, there were numbers scratched into the DVD which leads me to believe it was done before the disc left the factory since each one was factory sealed. BEWARE!!!"
4,Great Collection,This is a very nice set to have with all the classic Dracula movies in it. The only thing that sucks is the flip disc and the quality and the sound.
3,Mixed Bag,Poor Audio (low volume-lots of hiss) and poor image quality doom the original in this boxed set. What is clearly the best of the films was given the bum's rush! Dracula's Daughter was exceptional in both image and audio-a perfect presentation. Much looked the same for Son of Dracula-but alas-the DVD jammed and the entire thing was sent back to Amazon for replacement. I am hoping for better with the next set!
2,TERRIBLE & Destructive packaging of some important films,"Sure the cover looks great and it's wonderful to have collected five key Universal Dracula films in one place but, as other reviewers have pointed out, the disks too easily slip from their moorings and scratch hell out of them. Even finding an unscratched disk is no guarantee that the films will play (for some reason, Son of Dracula simply refused to start on three different DVD players). I had to go through three sets before landing on one that plays everything. The bulk of material here is great (I teach film and I'm satisfied with the transfer quality and supplements), but I cringe at the commentary by VAN HELSING director, Stephen Sommers, as he really has nothing of interest to say and as the whole project smacks of tie-in marketing. Universal REALLY dropped the ball on this to the point where an upgrade and free-trade in would be within reason."
3,Not quite as good as previous release(s),"While the new slim packaging is nice and I can't argue the price, there are two things I find wrong with the Dracula Legacy collection. First of all, the production notes for all the films were left off. Why? I sold my Son of/Daughter of disc in anticipation of this coming out, so now I've lost them. But more importantly, the sound on the original Dracula film is, to my ears, much worse than the 1999 release- certain words are now inaudible- and since I saved my Dracula disc, I can verify this. Whereas before, dialogue was given a boost- it hasn't now and it's just a monotonous blur. The transfer still remains bad, but I can't say which one is better or if it is actually the same print. Keep these criticisms in mind, if given the choice between buying the original discs (which lack HOD) and the new set. I haven't seen anyone else complain about the audio differences in other reviews..."
1,Poor packaging made for an annoying experience...,"I've ordered other Legacy sets with no problems. When Dracula arrived the 2nd disk had come loose in the package and was covered with scratches and scuff marks on boths sides (unplayable). I returned it and asked for a replacement. When the replacement arrived the exact same thing happened! Did I get a batch that was dropped on the warehouse floor?? I returned the replacement and asked for a refund. I ended up purchasing the set from a local store.That being said, this is an excellent compilation of vintage movies that every horror buff must have in their collection. It took me 3 tries but I finally did it!"
4,Bela Lugosi Dracula Worth Treasuring,"I like the Dracula movie with Bela Lugosi, even better when music was added, that version represented as special feature. Lon Chaney as Dracula doesn't make it. He's forever Wolf Man. House Of Dracula has Chaney as Wolf Man and Frankenstein monster makes the scene. I didn't care too much for Dracula's Daughter. I liked the Spanish version Dracula a lot. Altogether, I felt the sequels doesn't have much worth. The worst part is I too experienced erractic play to Son Of Dracula. Different players have different results with flawed discs. The erractic play lasted about ten minutes with disc I got, where it skipped along, but afterwards it played fine. I could've done with Dracula alone, but the added bonus movies are welcomed."
3,Quality,"Mainly purchased for the spanish version of Dracula was dissapointed w some spot freezing on the dvd. Cleaned carefully several times w no solution.Seems defective as others have reported on these ""Legacy collections"". Otherwise a must addition to any dvd library."
3,Torn with this one.,"Bela Lugosi is the quintessential Dracula. So it is hard for me to write this review. I found that the main movie ""Dracula"" just does not stand up to the test of time. I felt it was rather boring, although I loved Bela's performance. The other movies in this set are equally slow paced, although it was interesting to see Lon Chaney Junior as Dracula (or was he supposed to be his son?) in ""Son Of Dracula"".To make matters worse NONE of the movies in this set have been digitally remastered, so even if you are huge fan of old timey monster movies, like me, you might be upset by the fading quality of these prints. Oddly enough, other than Dracula the prints are pretty good. It is with Dracula that I found the scratches, very dark, fading in and out images most annoying.Still the price is good, and for nostalgia's sake, I gave this set a 3. I would really have preferred a remastered version of Dracula even though I found it boring. It deserves better treatment."
5,Great Dracula Collection,"""Creatures of the night"" and ""Children of the night"" are featured on this nice package. Formidable movies, considering that most of them were filmed in the early thirties. I used to watch the classic Dracula movies in my younger years, I really loved them, and still do. This is a great collection, well worth having. Also recommended are Frankenstein the Legacy Collection and The Mummy Collection."
3,packaging,"The transfers are as good as I would hope for. However, all the discs were loose in their container and rattling about. The first disc had a crack at the center hole. It doesn't seem to hurt the viewing, but since it was opened I have no recourse. All of the collections purchased, Frankenstein, Wolfman,and The Sherlock Holmes sets arrived the same way. It is really appalling at this slipshod manner of selling merchandise. Individuel DVDs are tight in their packaging, but the collections are, pardon the expression, the pits. One wonders what I will find as I go through these movies over the months. I hope I find no more surprises. These classics deserve better treatment. Again I do like the transfer on the Dracula disc and the rest will probably be the same. At least I hope so. Who knows how many scratches and bumps have been added to the pristine originals by the packaging? Only the the Shadow..."
2,POOR QUALITY,This is NOT the restored print of Dracula 1931 that Universal previously released on DVD a few years earlier.If you have that DVD keep it as the quality on this box set is awful.I can only think that whoever was in charge of compiling this didn't bother to look or didn't know that Universal had a fully restored copy of this film.
4,Poor Audio Quality,"As other people have said the audio on this DVD release of Dracula is the 1931 censored version. In this version you don't hear Renfield scream when Dracula kills him and Dracula screams only once when he dies. WHY Unverisal deemed these screams too intense or scary for 2004 viewers is a mystery to me. It doesn't distract from the film too much, but the overall quality of the audio in this DVD release is very bad. But it's better than nothing. If you have the first DVD release of Dracula KEEP IT because it is the uncensored version and the audio is much more clear. Would have given this 5 stars because it's a very good deal (5 movies), but it's obvious flaws made me bump that amount down to a 4."
2,Van Hesling ruined these movies.....,"When I saw that awful movie, it forever ruined the older Dracula films that were included in this DVD boxed set. Perhaps the Dracula films were never that great to begin with."
2,"CAUTION: Flawed DVD discs, not the motion pictures themselves","I love the classic Universal black and white monster movies---not sure why they manufactured and sold flawed discs. My discs (unlike many reviews) were not scratched, but pristine. The first disc (containing Dracula) worked fine. But the second disc is flawed. ""House of Dracula"" starts to skip and lock up just after the 58 minute mark, when Talbot comes in to confront the doctor. Same thing occurred on two different DVD players of mine which are cleaned regularly. So don't get too upset as it seems many people have received flawed copies of these ""Legacy"" collections. A recall is in order. I hope Universal releases fully functional Blue-Ray discs of these."
2,Stay away from this one....,"This was done by Disney? Wow! After so many really good films, they finally made one that the kids complained about.The talking animals was poorly done. They should have paid more attention to other talking animals films.My kids did not like this one very much. It was close to the original story, but just not fun. If you have little ones (under 10), you would be better off with Disney's animated Jungle Book film."
2,good for the price,"only one big problem, the tuning pegs will NOT stay put and the fine tuning pegs at the bottom break at a the drop of a hat."
3,review on cello CCO-300 4/4,"We order this cello for our son , cello come in good package,we received complete set as advertise, no damage.We went to the violin shop near by and asked them to replacestring, nothing wrong with their string but we like toup grade to high quality of string, at this point my sonlike it very much. Good instrument so far."
2,You get what you pay for,"The cello is poor quality, the bridge didn't even fit... But the case, stand, set of strings and so on are almost worth the price. I sent it back."
1,What now???,"OK, so I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It arrived...and...there are no instructions or directions. What do I do now? How do I get it ready so she will be able to play around with it on Christmas? This is ridiculous.Am I really supposed to figure this our on my own? I am almost angry enough to send it back."
4,Be who you really are!,"How people perceive you is who you really are. At first I didn't understand how that could be true - but after reading this book that statement became very clear. This book opened my eyes to the idea of perceptions and how perceptions are so important. How people perceive you is how they understand who you are. They can only know you through your actions, because that's all they can see. The only one that knows what you're thinking is you. So make sure your actions reflect who you really are. If the you on the ""outside"" aligns with the you on the ""inside"" you'll be much happier for it."
3,Beauty and simplicity,"In the short period that I've own the M8, I have learned more about optics, technique and photography than in any other time in my life. Had I chose a more conventional camera; I doubt that I would make this assessment. Still, we develop and move forward and the M8 is no less of a camera today, than it was when I purchased it. If anything, its better following the last firmware (AWB) update. Still, the M8 is markedly expensive vs. its features and for this reason alone; I can't recommend it to most people. However, if you love rangefinder style shooting, then you will love this camera!~ Digital Dude"
3,Not satisfied,"I bought a used Leica M8 camera recently and used it for a while. It was not as good as I expected. The image quality really relys on your PS skill. Without the UV/IR filter, the outcome was frustrating. It quite easy to leave mark on the black chrom top plate. With spending 3k on M8, I rather to have the new Leica MP film camera body."
3,Disappointed with this one...,"I had high expectations for this release but was disappointed with the unsightly sets, off-putting choreography, unimaginative costumes and a lot of other problems with the production. As someone else already noted, perhaps this production would have been suitable for the blind. It truly is a distraction and interferes with the music. I was not only bored but actually even irritated. Such a pity to mindlessly spoil a beautiful piece of music...My perception of the singing and the acting was affected and marred by this strange production, which is, in my opinion, incompatible with the true essence of the music here."
1,Very ugly production,"Rameau's music for this opera is wonderful and it is well-performed by Les Talens Lyriques under Christophe Rousset. The vocal performances are very good, except that Panzarella screeches from time to time.The problem with this production is that the sets are extraordinarily ugly. Yes, they're minimalist, but they're also just plain ugly and add nothing to the merits of the opera. The costumes are mediocre at best. Worst of all, the choreography is ugly. The acting is quite weak as well. In every visual respect, this production detracts from Rameau's music rather than illuminating it.If you haven't already seen Rameau's Les Indes Galantes, get that instead, or try a CD version of this opera. I recommdend skipping this monstrosity."
3,HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!! Rich Little at his one-man show best,"Rich plays all the roles of all the characters of the classic Christmas Carol, in one of the funniest versions I have ever seen. He portrays Scrooge as W.C. Fields, Harvey Korman as Bob Cratchit, Edith Bunker As Mrs. Cratchit, Truman Capote as Tiny Tim, Richard Nixon as Jacob Marley.......I could go on and on......you have to see this hilarious movie to believe this man's talent."
2,Less accessible,"I purchased both this book and the Alkalesi book and found the Alkalesi book to be much more straightforward and accessible. This book is good for doing lots of drills, but it is not an easy way to learn the basics of Iraqi Arabic."
3,Quit a rollercoaster ride but...,"This is quite a fantastic rollercoaster ride (as you can expect from any Matthew Reilly novel!!!) but this book plain defies the logic at most points....great book to read while you're waiting for a plane or while travelling, but if you're looking for logic, look elsewhere"
1,A plot too far ...,"I like action novels, especially if they have a technical element. Reilly's ""Scarecrow"", desite claims of technical advice from ex-military, was not only beyond implausible, it was laughable. Some of the antics were schoolboy-imagination stuff; way, way beyond credulity. This is my first and last Reilly experience."
1,The horror....,"I had the misfortune to read this book while in Prague, after being robbed by fake police and getting a hotel with raw sewage leaking from the bathroom floor drain. Reading this book was like combining those two experiences. The plot is like a fifth-grader trying to top his buddies telling stories in the treehouse; the writing just doesn't get any worse. To say this series aspires to be a video game is not intended as a compliment. If you want to read something to motivate you to get outside during a hurricane, this here's your ticket."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!WHAT A RIDE,"I have read all but one of Reilly's books (contest). After reading Ice-Station I was floored. It was non-stop action. Well Scarecrow is even BETTER!From the start of the book it is one awesome gun battle,explosion, car/boat/plane/missle chase after another. Reilly is my favorite author. NOBODY can write a novel the way he can. Caution if you are one of those wanna-be Tom Clancy guys who like to complain about the details ""That was all wrong the wxr-89 fires a .6754mm shell not a .6755mm one!"" Then this is NOT for you, go read the latest issue of Solider of Fortune. This book is for anyone who enjoys a exciting out of this world story with lots of things blow up and cool weapons. Perfect for the long commute home. The only problem is that it is so good you will read it in hours, leaving you begging for more. PLEASE tell me that the Black Knight will get his own book. Just make sure you read Ice-Station first, then pick this up and enjoy."
1,"Please, NO MORE ITALICS!","If you're into mindless, unrealistic action, then this book is for you. From the very beginning, Reilly builds a ever increasing tempo of action. Problem is, it's so far-fetched that the reader inevitably skims through the action sequences and scoffs at the results. It's just not a fulfilling read in any sense of the literary word.Oh, and Mr. Reilly, if you ""happen"" to read this, there is no contest for the most italized actions sequences and exclamations in a work of literature. In fact, your overt attempt to punctuate action scenes works the opposite way when it's used as much as you did. Just an opinion..."
1,The 'Scarecrow' should have stayed in the 'Wizard of Oz',"What starts out as an action thriller ends up as absurd action filler to replace any sort of physical reality. I think Reilly has missed his calling; he should be writing for comic books, instead of the book market. Then maybe he could have a movie made out of cartoon characters who never die, and hardly get wounded under the most dire circumstances. I'm surprised the characters who do die, as in having their heads cut off, don't somehow grow them back and return to fight another day! Maybe he can incoporporate the 'Roadrunner' in some of his over-the-top scenes! Beep-Beep!!"
2,Just not very good,"Anyone who has read Reilly's books in the past know he's not a terribly strong writer. However, in the past, he has made up for the poor literary skills with compelling stories. Not so this time. The writing is so bloody awful, even for Reilly, that I can't bear to read anymore. Like mentioned earlier, italics are over used, and he's gone way overboard on onomatopoeia.Reilly's other books are readable, especially when you need a page turner to distract you from, say, a long plane-ride. This is not one of those books, simply because it's written so poorly."
1,Horrible... Sorry Reilly.,"Mat Reilly's scarecrow is sub-par read. Exciting and interesting but really shollow at others. The World Wide Bounty hunt is amazing, purely orginal but the way it's set up is horrible. The man just doesn't seem to die. And I do mean he can't die. Some lines make you cringe and a headache forms when Reilly can't actually set up some dialogue that makes real sense. The book should have been better."
2,not my cup of tea,"i can't help it but compare to how reilly writes his book to jeffrey archer.. i consider archer as my first love in thriller reading and this book is 3/4 of action in the field and 1/4 explaination and it's the other way around in archer's book..for people who prefers action to explaination this would be a good choice but it wasn't for me...however i have to compliment on the story line..i think the idea of the bounty hunter was brilliant and quite interesting however the story fails to flow..i love the character of scarecrow and mother and i also love the element of surprise...it's not very often you come across things like this..but sadly i didn't read the whole book, i skipped all the actions and went straight to the explaination"
1,Way too violent,This is one book that should be removed from the shelves. There is so much violence and explicit carnage that the book is essentially unreadable. I read to about page 20 before deleting it from the bookshelf. Why it is necessary to populate what could have been an interesting tale with so many violent scenes is beyond me. I f this is American society at its worst I'm glad I live in Australia.
3,Australian SF Reader,"Shane Schofield, the Scarecrow, is one of the few men in the world with the officially tested reflexes to perform the tasks necessary to shut down a certain super weapon in time.Because of this, a nutty supervillain type wants to get him out of the way.Probably just easier to have said weapon a long way away from Schofield, in the end.The odd shocker, but not as good as the others, I think."
3,Triple X - Vin Diesel Type of Stuff,"Military researches done by the author is quite succinct. There is a little romance in it. Rest of it just chase, find, shoot and kill some guys. Scarecrow has the potential to become a blockbuster movie.Scarecrow is set in different places all around the world, imminent of nuclear missile bombings all around the world. If you like this kind of stuff, should try Clive Cussler's The Oregon Files' Sacred Stone. It has similar intensities, but written at a different angle from Reilly. Scarecrow is actually a call sign of a military captain of the US armed forces. He got stuck in a nasty and wicked web of the Cream of the Crop of the world Chauvinistic society.Through the thriller is quite good for its genre fans, this is not exactly my type. But somewhat a good written book. Since rating is required, I wish I can give between 3-4 stars, but heck, a 3 star for this Aussie writer."
1,Ridiculously over the top,"This novel must have been written for some big screen, off the planet adventure flick. Completely unbelievable, I found myself shaking my head on so many occasions. Having said that, maybe that was what kept me reading to the end......."
2,Scarecrow...The earlier books were better...,"Well, having liked Ice Station and Temple, and to a lesser extent Area 7, I bought this book to continue with the Schofield adventures. I think he tried to outdo the formula that made the other books successful. He tries to pack too much action into it, and the result is not that the book is fast-paced, but rather, that it keeps building improbable situations on top of each other until you look at it and say ""there is NO way this can happen!"" Like an above reviewer said, it reads like a comic book. I also don't like the way he killed off a main character in it, and the way he did it ruined the book for me. My $.02"
1,Scarecrow if for the birds,"This is a truly awful book. First, the plot is based on Marxist nonsesne,that big businessmen control the world and even worse nonsene: that they would make more money if they first destroyed the world! Second, there is so much action (maybe 200 episodes if you count actions within actions) and so many impossible, hairbreadth escapes that the whole thing becomes ridiculous.Third, the author kills off the one romantic interest for no good reason, so the book is malevolent as well as preposterous. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Flat out writing a shopping list,"Matthew Reily set out to blow readers away with this book, all he managed to do was turn readers away. This once decent authours latest work is terrible, his shopping list would be more interesting to read. Over the top situations that defy everything from physics to plain reality gives offence to the average reader. When i read i like realism and facts, it makes for a believable story, i like something different and un-original its refreshing, i like character building to make it easier to relate to and understand the under currents of the story and the characters in it, but most of all i like a good plot or twist..this book failed to deliever any of the above.Simply Terrible i hope he doesn't give up his day job and if he does manage to write a hollywood script god help us all, its about time us sinners had another street fighter movie on our hands to punish us.Rubbish"
4,Awesome Story About Beast Boy!,"I've only ever seen the cartoon about the Teen Titans on Cartoon Network, and frankly Beast Boy always seemed to be there for comic relief. I never knew that he was also an actor or that he wanted to get back into acting. It was also really interesting to see exactly how he got his powers, that was never explained on the show. The fact that it was from a rare disease mixed with the cure that he was given to remedy it was VERY awesome.The side story about Super Boy trying to get Robin to come back to the Titans was good too.The artwork was very good as well. I'm normally a Marvel guy but this was worth crossing over into enemy territory and see what the other side had to offer. Flamestar's antics did make me laugh, and Raven's decision to go to a regular high school makes me want to search out the next volume of this series to see what'll happen next.This was a great comic!"
3,Great Story about Beast Boy,I just started this series because it is similar to the young justice show i watch on tv. I wouldve gave it a 5 but the binding fell apart one read
2,Totally Generic TITANS Adventures....,"Geoff Johns' revival of TEEN TITANS has been less than thrilling so far, and the latest volume, BEAST BOYS & GIRLS, is no exception. The low-priced volume reprints seven issues: A four-issue BEAST BOY mini-series from 2000, and issues 13-15 of TEEN TITANS, which also focus on BEAST BOY. Garfield Logan has always been one of the least-interesting members of the team, so I wasn't expecting much out of this book, but I was still disappointed. Johns has been turning out some really mediocre work on TITANS, and the BEAST BOY mini-series, co-written by Ben Raab, isn't any better. TITANS completeists will want to add BEAST BOYS & GIRLS to their collection....Everyone else can safely pass and move on to Volume 4. There's nothing worth seeing here....."
4,awsome and easy to use,"These are great the dust does not fly around in the air. You really can use them anywhere cars, air vent covers in the house, tv's, computers. My kids even use them to clean their rooms."
2,cheaper at costco,"I have seen these much cheaper at costco, unfortunately after I bought three, three packs from Amazon. Costco charges only about 12$ for 20 pieces. I love Amazon but check with Costco before you buy here."
5,A must have for theology students,"If you are a student of theology, or just happen to be interested in theology, YOU MUST HAVE THIS BOOK! I own a number of books that offer introductions to modern theologians, but none of them are as good as this one.First of all, it's readable. The articles, while thorough, help put very difficult and complex ideas in very simple forms.Second, it's complete. The book covers every important modern theologian. It gives a brief biographical sketch, places the theologian in the context of particular movement/periods, lists their key works, summarizes their most important contributions to theology, and covers important critiques.I consult this book constantly for a quick intro to a thinker I am not familiar with. For theology students, the book is a must have."
1,one more thing,"This book has a paucity of differential diagnostic lists. Most cases in chest are nonspecific and forming a differential diagnosis is a necessary skill. This book lacks that. Most times, it gives one specific diagnosis for a very nonspecific image and clinical history. Not very useful."
2,Don't read before bedtime!,"It was a revelation to me to read the details of the many hells that the Tibetan Buddhist tradition believes in. The horrors described by the 16 year old Delog (a person who ""dies"" and returns to life after about 5 days) in the afterlife make Dante's hell a beach. The rest of her life is spent exhorting others to behave well lest they end up in one of these hells. Crimes include, in addition to what you'd expect - murder, theft - ""wrong"" thinking, rudeness to a Lama, killing an animal without the need to do so, not sharing one's meal with a visitor...for all these one gets an after-life of torture unending. Don't read it before bedtime!"
3,"Good in beginning, middle was boring, end ok","Book had lots of insight into Doris's life, yet some of the details were boring. I liked the parts where she talked about her co-dependence and how she overcame that and helped her husband with his alcoholism. There were a some typos in the book, which I found distracting. Overall a so-so read."
4,Just a Little Disappointed,"Her book is good. I was only disappointed because I was hoping she would go more into her time with ""Everybody Loves Raymond"". Other than that, it's a pretty good read. Her recipes look good too."
2,"Memoirs, not an autobiography","This is a collection of reminiscences. If you are interested in show biz memoirs, you'll like this. I like biographies that explain people's minds and behaviors, and I didn't care for this. There are lots of recipes, which is a cute idea, but they all look WAY too complicated."
3,An Inside Peek at Theatre and Life,"Are You Hungry Dear is an easy read. Doris shares an inside peek of theatre, her early life as well as some recipes she recommends. I enjoyed reading about her childhood, complete with cold grandparents and a busy, absent mother. Her grit and determination to make a life for herself is truly inspiring.She also shows just how very self-centered actors are, with no apologies. They crave the attention of everyone and always want the limelight. I would have loved to have read a little more about her son. I found there was not an over abundance of details about her personal life, more on the show business side of things."
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"Doris Roberts is endearing in this very straightforward book about her life, including who she has known in the New York Theatre scene. She has a full theatrical history and has known and interacted with many New York City actors. She includes her time on the ""Everyone Loves Raymond"" TV Series, but she tells us about her beginnings also. I loved reading this book. I did not anticipate such a good read. Also: the bonus is a recipe at the end of each chapter, yes, including Steak Pizzaolla! (The one recipe she was reluctant to give Debra, in the show)."
5,This album delivers on its promise,"I first heard a glowing review of this compilation on NPR and, as a fan of world music, thought it would be an interesting gamble. This gamble paid off handsomely. If you enjoy eclectic music, a melange of instruments and styles, and simple but well-executed arrangements, this is one you shouldn't miss. At the Amazon price, it is also quite a bargain. Currently hard to get retail local to where I am."
1,Not quite what I wanted,"I bought this to use as a card reader, but it's really hard to use that way. It probably works great to convert an unused memory stick to a USB drive."
3,Only covers the first 10 years of the Cowher era,"I guess you should take the title literally, as this book only covers the years 1992-2001 of the Cowher era in Pgh. That said, it does an adequate job of documenting those seasons for those who wish to learn (or relive) that period in Steeler history."
4,Good Quality That Lasts,"This is the second pair of these gloves. I returned to Harbinger because of their quality. I work out 5 times per week using these and even after numerous washes, they held up for more than 6 months. Additionally, it is a challenge to find 2x or larger sized gloves. Harbinger delivers my size when others can't."
3,The hook part comes apart,"The hook part starts to tear right away if you use it for heavy lifting. Literally, on the first time of use for traps I found it had ripped and started to come apart. They should be made more sturdy and I was disappointed in them."
3,Stiching Issues,"These gloves are a good design but the last pair I bought the stiching is splitting in two areas (index finger and top right part of the glove)after only two weeks. Tip: if you have normal size hands, buy extra large."
4,Decent for price,"Pro's-ComfortableEasy to put on and offWrist strap gives enough support without being restrictiveCon's-A little too thick (this can cause issues for holding on to barbells etc.I use these primarily when I am doing shoulder shrugs and push-press/power cleans. Aside from this I don't typically wear gloves due to the added thickness. These gloves are no exception on the thickness, but do provide the added support in the wrist and protect my hands from the new grips on the bars that cause blistering during prolonged sets of snatch and cleans.I would buy these again, and I would recommend them to a friend for wha tI use them for. Unfortunately it is a delicate balance between thickness and durability...."
2,very disappointing,"Fairly comfortable and did indeed help with excersizes that normally give my forearm splints. however after 2 uses, the stitching was coming loose on the side. after another week, it was a hole. they are still alive and in use but look like crap now. dont think it was worth the money"
4,Good Value for Money,"I ordered these gloves about 4 weeks back and I havent faced any problem, like people mentioned that cheaper gloves will tear etc.I trust the name ""Harbinger"". Good enf.One thing I notices that if you go to gym with out wearing gloves, well just get them, I use to do some 10 pull-ups after that my hands use to hurt. I tried these gloves on and I was able to do 20+ that's when I realized how much time I was wasting in gym, without the gloves.The wrist strap is great as it provide support while lifting heavy weights. But some times if it gets in way u can just loosen it."
3,Run a bit small,"These are nice but the sizes are smaller than would be expected. Good quality though. The leather was nice but more ""grip"" would have been better."
3,don't get too used to em' they don't last long,"I have owned these gloves for almost two years now, and a week ago one of them ripped near the thumb area because the leather got too worn out. of course i have used them a lot as my primary gloves for about two years so i am not disappointed, however what i am disappointed about is the lack of padding. the padding is so minimal that after six months i had to buy pads to attach over the glove in order to relieve pain on my palm. also i find that even after the gloves are broken in they will still cut from between the fingers.as for the pros of these gloves, they have really good grip and the wrist strap is very efficient in reducing wrist pain making them a popular choice at the gym [i have seen many people sporting them]. In conclusion however i would not recommend these gloves to someone who lifts heavy and frequently, simply because the gloves are very light and the material is not very durable"
2,Wouldn't buy again,"I've been using these gloves for several months now, but wearing them once a week.I have three issues with these:1. They are very hard to take off after exercising. There are no fins or loops to pull them from your hands, so I end up turning them inside out while taking them off. Very annoying2. They tore in couple of places. First, the seam on little finger on one glove gave in, then the actual material tore along another seam between thumb and pointer finger. Not good quality3. The strap that wraps around your wrist is soft and not wide enough. While it is OK with lighter weights, it doesn't provide enough support with heavier lifting.I wouldn't buy these again."
3,Too small! Get two size bigger.,"PRO:Did the job by protecting my palms and wrists. I could do more bench press reps with the help of wrist protection.CON:TOO SMALL! I'm 5'5"" and have medium size hands. I ordered a large size, but it was too tight. I HIGHLY suggest you to get 2 size larger if you plan to buy this.Also, the finger parts of the glove hurt my fingers when I was working with dumbbells or bars. The reason for this was when I closed my hand and made a fist, my fingers were pushing against the finger parts of the glove. I didn't know if this was because the gloves were too small or the poor design."
4,a little bit tight,"it did feel tight , but you can get used to it after wearing it for a whileI got a large one and I have kind of regular hands .. but it's good anyway"
3,"I love Harbinger, but not these gloves...","These gloves are a little bulky and hard to take off. They get the job done, however, I don't think I will be ordering another pair anytime soon. They tend to squeeze my hands and while preventing calluses, they give me a blister. Next time I will go with a pair of Harbinger gloves that aren't so bulky."
3,"a bit snug, hard to put on and to take off","got it large according to the size chart, but they were a bit tight, and it's really hard to put them on. it feels like I'm dislocating my fingers every time I'm potting them on!**update** now that i've used them for a couple of weeks, it fits ok, so it'll get one more star,,"
5,"Harbinger Classic WristWrap Glove (Black, Large)","I am guessing this is a rare happening, but my gloves I just received wore away the stitching on their first use. I must say, that last pair I owned lasted much longer, and my cousin whom has owned 2 pairs have never had an issue. So I feel these are great gloves, I just had a bad egg. I recommend them as they are quite comfortable and have nice wrist support."
4,excellent wrap gloves for the price,"sizes run a little smaller than expected, but for the most part- excellent glove...i used them very heavily and they keep up- wish i purchased a bigger size thou, the size chart was a little off- otherwise excellent glove/value for the price"
2,Worse than bare hands,"I got these because I wanted protect my hand from callouses and also stabilize my wrists which were hurting from lifting. I researched the sizing carefully, but these just felt too bulky. They fit tight, but there is so much fabric on the palms that it bunches up and actually causes callouses worse then with bare hands. I didn't feel much wrist support with the straps on. I returned the gloves."
4,A rainbow anime? cool to me!,Really cute and colorfull and pretty funny. Starts out a bit slow but it does pick up. All the characters are (and Nanas) pretty loveable. My favorite is the violet Nanapon (i think that's what she's called) if you watch this you'll see why. The animation for this show is very lovely. And the songs are pretty cute.
5,Written by one of the top preachers in our country,"Dr Barbara Taylor Brown is considered to be one of the top twelve preachers in the USA today. This book contains excellent examples of her creative, scholarly and down to earth approach in communicating the 'seeds' of the Gospel."
1,Red dots are NOT RED!,I ordered these RED dots thinking they would actually be red but they are more orange than red.False advertising!
4,Historical,"I've always liked Terry Reid's music and this is just about the only available documentation of what his live shows must have been like.If you want to actually *see* Reid playing live, try to find a copy of the DVD 'Groupies'. It's a downbeat documentary about groupies in the early 70s, and the absolute highlight of the disc is the live performances by Reid."
3,Rather thin,"Testing their newly developed teleportation technology, Dr. Justin Cruz and his team discover that their test subjects are being shifted into parallel universes whose difference from the universe of origin increases in proportion to the distance the subject has been sent. Not a bad idea for a novel, but John Brunner fails to develop his theme adequately in this thin volume. Brunner's forte is really more toward the societal aspects of speculative fiction rather than technological extrapolation, yet he depends too much on almost mystical computers and technobabble regarding ""transfinite numbers"" to achieve his effect. The device of subtly different alternate universes could have been exploited in far more interesting ways."
5,Statistics book,Used in my Management class- this book is must have for quality analysis and control
3,Old school,"Allot of the songs are similar, but I still like them. Takes me back to the good old days."
5,AllerTest,"Since I am allergic to Nickel, this product has been very useful. I discovered that my hair clips and barrettes contain high amounts of nickel. Some of my jewelry that I thought contained nickel and had stopped wearing however ended up not containing nickel."
4,Discontinued?,"That's a bummer. Even though I thought the price for this was too steep, I like the product itself. I'm allergic to nickel, so I keep this in my purse to test jewelry when I'm shopping. For the price, though, they could have at least included a few cotton-tib swabs."
4,Allertest Nickel Detection Kit,"I recently was diagnosed with a nickel allergy and was advised to avoid contact with belt buckles, snaps or other direct contact with nickel. Not knowing whether my belts or clothing contained nickel was a problem so I was happy to find this kit. It's quite easy to use and comes in a prescription bottle which is rather clever. I take a cotton swab and add a drop from each bottle to the tip. I swirl the swab on the item to be tested and look for a pinkish color to appear, indicating nickel.I gave it 4 stars because they could have added a few cotton swabs for convenience. Overall, I thought the price was decent and it works as advertised."
3,NOT GOOD FOR TESTING FOR NICKEL IN METEORITES,"I bought this kit to test for nickel in meteorites. Most meteorites have 5% to 15% nickel and a positive check for nickel helps to confirm that it is a meteorite. I tested a number of known meteorites and it was not sensitive enough to indicate positive for nickel. The kit does work because I tested it on an actual nickel (coin) but if your purpose is to try to identify a meteorite, it simply isn't sensitive enough to indicate positive for that amount of nickel (5% to 15%)."
5,Very detailed model,"I purchased this to scan into a computer and increase the size to make a larger model airplane that actually flies. As a desk model, it is very detailed. I recommend you keep the plans nice by using food wrap and you can build multiple models. The plastic parts could be a little easier to mount but that is not a big problem. I also recommend taking time to make a detailed cockpit and better augmenters for the engine."
5,"If I was a man, I would become gay now....","WOW, I'm seventeen years old now, and I swear, Paul Monette's ""Halfway Home"" is the first book that touches me to tears. When I bought this book, I thought it would be just an ordinary ""gay-story"".I started to read without big expectations, hoped that I don't fall asleep(I often become tired while reading boring stories)and the more I was surprised: After four hours of reading without any interuptions I realised that I fell in love with ""Halfway Home"". I'm deeply impressed how wonderful Paul Monette discribes the growing love between two men, their feelings and their life together. I have not been confrontated with homosexuality or AIDS yet, and so this book opend my eyes. In May 1999 I will pass the matura and for one of my special topics I chose ""HIV and AIDS"". I love this book!!!!I thank you, PAUL MONETTE for a few lovely, romantic and also sad hours."
2,Halfway Home? I was bored halfway!,"There's nothing interesting about this book at all. I was bored from the beginning thinking it'll pick up in the middle. I found myself reading through the book just to finish it because I don't like to leave books unread. If you get offended easily where religion is concerned then Miss. Jesus as played by the title character in the book as a flamboyant Jesus Christ might offend you. The drama is to dry. Though it ends on a happy note for the character, I was just happy to finish the book."
3,It's ok,Love the NPR weekly broadcast; not so much this CD. Doesn't have the variety of things as the weekly show has.
4,Ahhhhh....,"I live in an area with almost no world cuisine culture, and I wanted to introduce my family to the tastes and sounds of India. I purchased this CD for background music to go with a nice spicy biryani. CD #2 provided the PERFECT background music to a perfect meal! The instruments are clear and crisp and the sound quality is amazing. It wisks you away to a far away land. I listened to the CD while cooking our meal and it felt as if I had entered into an Indian Restaurant, or at least what I imagined in my dreams that an Indian restaurant would be like. It set the perfect mood.Party suggestion: Set the table low, wrap a Saree around you, brush up on your Indian table manners, glide CD #2 into the player and cook up a nice curry dinner. After dinner do some Henna Tattoos (kit) and try some bellydancing (DVD). What a nice treat for your family or friends."
5,Best shaving solution ever!,I've been using it for over 4 yrs. You shave less and skin feels great! Almost no cuts or ingrown hair.
5,Love,"This is the best shave cream. Especially for those of us with thick, coarse hair. I was apprehensive about trying the green tea because I have only used lavender scent, but it is a great scent. I actually like it better. Nice clean and refreshing smell. Wouldn't use any other cream."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!,Fantastic shaving cream! Also a great hair conditioner. The green tea scent is very light and refreshing. 16oz for the price of 8! Can't beat the value. Worth ordering through Amazon!
2,"smelled good, but...","The green tea scent was nice, but this didn't do anything to prevent or reduce my razor bumps along my bikini line. Also, it's like a conditioner, so I felt like it left a residue on my skin."
3,GOOD WITH OTHER MATERIALS,"I was forwarded this book by my AP teacher. I thought that along with the class, the book helped. I would use this along with your class textbook and class notes. But if you are taking this without a class, I would not recomend it. I would definately use an actual text book, such as the AP version of World Civilizations: the global experience. the book is written by someone who writes the AP exam, and it very good. The book is definately worth the money. I would also use the college board's AP website for the requirements and make sure that you can answer those comparisons. I made charts that had those comparisons. But I would only use this book along with your class."
3,"OK, But Not The Best Choice","I used this APWH study guide with my students for 2 years and while it's an ""OK"" test prep manual, I've found factual errors about the APWH course and overly complicated sample answers to the essay questions. Until the Princeton Review ""Cracking the APWH Exam"" came out 2/2004, it was about the best you could find."
2,"Horrible Practice Questions, Mediocre Review Material","If you are looking for accurate practice exams and review questions, look elsewhere. In my 10+ years as an AP World History teacher, this book has by far some of the worst practice questions I have ever seen. There is hardly any practice for the DBQ, and the essay questions that are given for comparative and change over time are hardly something one would find on the actual exam. The review material itself is adequate, although I found that there is a lot of unnecessary information included that doesn't typically show up on the exams. I would highly suggest the Princeton Review's book instead of this Barron's publication."
1,Barron's AP World Hisotry,"This was the worst review book I have ever used. This was the one that my teacher's recommended, but it was a complete waste of money. I have used Kaplan, REA, Five Steps to a Five, and Cliffs, and this book just did not compare. Unless you want a paperback version of a textbook, this is not the book for you. The only upside was the practice multiple choice; however, it is not worth the money otherwise, so try something else if you want a book that makes it easy to review the subject material."
5,Don't Bother Reading the Textbook,"With the help of this book, I was able to get a 5 on the AP test with only one semester of practice. Our AP history teacher assigned this book instead of the textbook for our class. Everyday we read 20 or so pages and we did about three essays a week. If you follow this same schedule, you will most likely pass the test just reading this book and doing the practice essays. If your goal is to get a high grade on the AP test, read this book. Be warned that it is a fairly long book, so you will have to read about 10-20 pages a day. Reread it if possible. ""If you read this book three times, I guarantee you will pass the test."" -My Ol' Wise History Teacher"
3,How to Prepare for the AP World History 2007-2008 Review,"Generally For a used book it was in Ok condition. Some pages were missing and I would have liked to see that in the description by the seller. Took some time to arrive, but met the estimated dead-line. Well packaged and protected. Helpful book."
5,an awesome study tool,"if you read the book front to back like i did, there is no way in hell that you won't get a five. My suggestions is to come up with a reading schedule starting during spring break and read it all the way until the exam. Good luck and use this book!"
2,Most of the content was very obvious if you've done any research at all,"I ordered this hoping to get a little more in depth insight than what I could find by my own internet research and personal interviews of folks in the field; I was looking for more information as to pitfalls of the profession, as someone who was considering it. I really didn't find much of value here that I didn't already know. It was geared more to someone very young or just beginning to consider this career path. Some of the real downsides of the field weren't explored enough and overall kind of a shallow coverage of the topic. If you have spent any time at all researching yourself, you won't find a lot to enlighten you; that said, what information was imparted was factual and accurate as far as I could tell."
1,Save your money,Don't waste your money on this book. Most of the information is common sense or things you could find out elsewhere for free.
4,Some excellent step by step but at times too wordy,On page 30 the author has a step-by-step process for basic editing of a photo. This was the clearest explanation I have encountered. The steps are easy to follow and the author explains which steps need to be done in what order. There are other similar step-by-step processes throughout the book. At times though the clarity gets lost in over explanation. Unfortunately the explanations seldom help in understanding how to use the tool.However - the book provides overall clear intstuction and tips that I have not found other places.
2,this book is boaring,"In this book there is a deer mouse named Poppy,Ragweed,Clover and Valerian And Ereth.Ragweed is the fiance he had been missing for four weeks Poppy had found out some terribal news that ragweed had died.So Poppy and Clover went to Ereths house Ereth is a porcupine to se if he could help.I think this i a good book for poeple that like animals"
3,well-written but close-minded,"This book was informative, entertaining, well-written, and well-researched. Unfortunately, it was also biased to such a degree that I cannot recommend this book. The author based her research on assumptions and stereotypes. That said, the book provides interesting and insightful information on the creation of false memories. If you are interested in alien abduction skepticism theories, than this book is worth a read, but be aware that the author's own beliefs heavily influence both her research and her conclusions. On a positive note, the author is compassionate, personal, and likable. Although I couldn't disagree with her more on some points, I found myself compelled to continue reading, and take her viewpoints to heart like that of an old friend."
1,Fear of the Unknown Generates Rationalizations,An in-depth look into the Abduction Phenomena that reflects the incredible fear that exist in the minds of so many in our culture; especially in academia. We live in a time where it is believed that is a subject can be intelligently enough `explained away' then this `intelligent' analysis is proclaimed as the truth. This fearful phenomena seems to hold especially true in subjects that push on the edges of reality; that potentialy could redefine our reality. I think this book and its approach that the abductions `aren't really real' is damaging to the evolution of human consciousness.
5,Loved It !!!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was a well-paced romp through the suffrage era with a delightful heroine and a charming hero. There's a touch of mystery, and a large dose of the sensuality Patricia Waddell does so very well. You won't be disappointed with this book."
2,Disappointment,Just realize--if any of you are looking for the techno version of O Fortuna that came out around 1992 or so--this is NOT it. They just took portions of Carmina Burana and slapped a decent beat behind it.
1,terrible,"Can't believe i paid over 20.00 each sweatshirt, these are definitley rejects, the sleeves are six inches longer than my arm.I opened them because I thought they were good sweats, and i put them in washer, when I tried them on I was shocked, They have alot of nerve selling rejects on amazon. terrible"
2,"Great, another review","Always listed as a must read this book is as good as is all the recommended books coming from the government schools. It's mish mash! The writing is circular, therefore vague. That's why so many reviewers like it--who can pin down the story? Read it if you want to put another notch in your list of important books you've read."
4,THE DURANGO AFFAIR,"After Savannah & Durango had a one night stand & Savannah told Durango she was pregnant, I applauded Durango for taking care of Savannah & his child."
5,I Love Durango!!,Brenda Romance book are the greatest the westmoreland series are one of my favorites! Durango is a hotte like the rest of his cuzn and brothers! I truly enjoyed reading how he found and accepted love!
4,A Great Resource of the First Encyclopedia Series,"I have never really like the cartoon pictures Usborne has used in the past, however these colorful pictures are very impressive. There are bright pictures on each page - the layout is orderly and informative, not overcrowded. The contents of this book seems to be a compilation of the other ""First Encyclopedia"" series with a few different pictures. I have noticed that some of the information from the original series has been omitted or moved to different sections.The topics are: Our World, Animals and Plants, How Your Body Works, History, How People Live, Science, How Things Work, Space, Maps of the World, and a section on interesting facts.It is big and chunky, so not a very friendly couch book like the actual series, although it is definetly a great resource. We use it as our science spine for elementary grades."
5,Excellent resource!,"I'm a homeschooling mom and discovered Usborne books about 1 month ago. The internet linked books are fabulous because they include links to websites. These websites have so much information to supplement what we are learning.For example, my 10 yr old and I are learning abour Space this week. We've been reading about the space shuttle and astronauts. In addition, once we went to the Usborne site it directed us to an interactive activity. We were able to simulate a shuttle launch and we also completed a space mission by making the needed repairs to a module.Activities such as these are helping to reinforce what we're reading and that's why I recommend the Usborne internet-linked books."
2,Outdated and overly technical,"This book is essentially a collection of articles written across the decades. Most are early to mid-90s at the latest, and many of the programs discussed are no longer in place today. It is somewhat interesting from a historical/science perspective, but not very practical or helpful if you are reading it for insight/guidance on a loved one with DS living in 2010. Other than a few anecdotes and short stories from parents and individuals with DS, it largely reads like a series of excerpts from graduate students' thesis papers. Nine years of post secondary education, and I still had to skim to get myself through it."
3,PICK UP YOUR PACING,I read for my job 2 mysteries this moth Leaheys Broken Machines and Bruce FOresters first in a 14 part series and whilke both were intriguing FORESTERS ability to grip thr reader and never let go puts him head over heals with Leahey. BUY both because I think both asre th br reckoned with in the future.AGAIN Foresters FATAL MACHINES AND LEAHEYS BROKEN MACHINES ARE WELCOME ADDIONS TO EVERYONES LIBRARY
3,BE WARNED,"While I loved this show when it aired, the WB is really screwing things up. This DVD includes four episodes, however, if you bought Batman: The Legend Begins, you'll have bought the same episode twice (Christmas with the Joker)Here are the episodes:Christmas with the JokerThe Laughing FishFire from OlympusDeepr Freeze"
2,Don't waste ur money,Buying this would not make sense if you A. Bought Batman The Animated Series: Volume One or B. Batman TAS The Legend Begins. If you have one or the other and hopefully not conned by Warner to buy both and think you would want this then you would have 2 and if ur that rare case of ones who bought BOTH A. and B. then you would have 3 Christmas' with Joker. Now I would urge you to buy Volume One and later 2 then to go question yourself if you have this episode and why is this episode on both DVD's. Be safe and read before you buy.
1,Why settle for less?,"Instead of settling for four episodes, including a retread of what's already been released, go for the recently-released volumes. Each volume (as of this writing, two are on the market and the third is being released next month) contains 23 episodes. Every episode, I believe. All in order. You don't miss out. You get every story you remember as a kid (or a younger adult ... you geeks know who you are). More for your money, folks. You won't be disappointed."
2,Not recommended for graduate level,"As a doctoral student in special education, I enrolled in a human learning theory class with other masters and doctoral students. This book was assigned and after a semester with it, I can say I ""survived"" this text.It reads like the author's personal life story. There is a heavy focus on the author's family, children, collegiate life, etc. This book is more than sufficient for undergraduate learning, but in an advance course, this book falls flat on its face and leaves the reader wishing for a more mature presentation."
2,"Dark, slow and disappointing","For the caliber of actors (Sean Patrick Flannery, Melina Kanakaredes, JoBeth Williams), this was highly disappointing. Story is exceedingly slow to develop and scenes leave you hanging without resolution. The characters are connected but the ending leaves a lot to be desired (quite literally) as I wanted the story to continue and bring the life-stories to closure. Had so much potential but was disappointingly boring."
3,not very sturdy,"This product is more like a construction paper/index card hybrid. Compared to the ones that I ran out of, they are thinner and the surface is not as smooth. Not terrible, just not that great either."
3,It's good Tamil movie,"Restaurant worker Raghavan (Sarath Kumar) is the king of his domain at work but leads a meager existence at home. He can't believe his luck when he meets Geeta, a beautiful, pleasant young girl from an affluent family. Unfazed by Geeta's riches, Raghavan merely wishes to lead a life full of love with his newfound flame. Will their opposite backgrounds get in the way of their dream to be together?"
2,Boring - for Beginners,"It's about 44 minutes long and 40 of them you are punching or doing butterflies. There is no real cardio movement. Just, punch and more punch to an airbag that you can even punch hard because; as might as well just use a hanging balloon.I am used too the extreme, ultimate, the best of, cardio work outs by Billy Blank but this one was just too slow for me. I wish someone would of rate it before I bought it."
3,It's OK!,The Video is a decent work out however if you don't have the Standing Punching Bag you will be out of luck like me and punching and Kicking in the air. But I still sweated during the work out and my metabolism was up so I guess that's the goal.
1,Distinguishing between natural henna and unsafe alternatives,"I have not downloaded this article, but from the brief information given about it, I wonder if the author has distinguished between safe, natural henna and unsafe alternatives that contain PPD and other harmful additives. Natural henna, Lawsonia Inermis, is only in the most rare of cases harmful to the body. It is in fact good for the skin, antibacterial when used on nails, and acts as a natural sunblock. There are unfortunately products on the market that are not natural henna, but claim to be so, as well as tattoo artists who apply these products without any knowledge of the harm they cause. For more information on henna, see www.hennapage.com."
5,The perfect baguette board,"If you want no crumbs on your table this is the board to use when cutting a baguette. I use it on my sailboat, when we go to a picnic or simply when we have a dinner party. It is attractive, practical and very useful."
5,My Min-Pin LOVES this paste!,"My Min-Pin LOVES this paste! We just spent hundreds of dollars at the vet to get the plaque off his teeth, so I'm hoping it works as well as it seems to taste to him."
5,"My Mini Dachshund says it's ""yummy!""","Well, we're still getting used to the whole brushing thing, but my Mini Dachshund thinks the toothpaste itself is a treat. She gets really excited about food and treats in general, but this toothpaste is apparently like crack. I have to continually push her away while I'm trying to get the toothpaste on the brush and once on the brush she just attacks it. I don't dare wear the finger brush as she just chomps down on it and her teeth go right through it! Hopefully we can eventually get to the point where I can actually control her excitement (or she can) so that I can brush her teeth properly. For now though, the fact that she comes after it instead of being afraid of it is just fine with me. I do the best I can with the brushing part of it for now. :)"
1,Sent cat toothpast instead,I bought this for my puppies not knowing we did not have to have it for the first couple of months. When I pulled it out of the box this month I noticed it was CAT toothpaste and not dog toothpaste. Now to return it I will have to pay a penalty for their mistake.
4,Easy to use,"My dog is pretty easy going and puts up with my attempt to brush her teeth. I am certainly not doing as great a job as I do on my own, but I think the toothpaste itself works to break down the calculus on our dog's teeth. Anyhow, we have a great dane mix so the big head on this toothbrush is perfect for hitting her larger molars. I don't really use the smaller side because the whole operation takes only a couple of minutes before the dog starts to eat up the meat flavored toothpaste and then her tongue is all over the place in the way. All things considered, if I brush her teeth 2-3 times a week, her mouth looks great compared to before (she is only 3 so the buildup was not too bad)and her breath is better too."
4,"Dog likes well enough, not the best ""flavor""","As a toothpaste it works great. Kills dogs bad breath and helps their teeth stay healthy and white with only a few times a week brushing. Smells awful to humans though! I was thinking peanut as in ""peanut butter."" Think more like peanut oil from Chineese food. Dog doesn't mind.However, I recommend BEEF flavored. Dog loves it and it smells pretty good to humans, too."
5,"OK...add me to the ""wow I was shocked"" list.....","People....please don't risk your dogs life and waste your hard earned money at the vets office.....try this stuff. I wish I had a video camera....my Smooth Collie....who do to her personality I call ""the effing squirrel"".....sits there and chatters her teeth in ecstasy with this stuff. And I am being literal....I have never seen a dog do this before....but it's like she is trying to suck the stuff off her teeth....As soon as I pick up the ziplock bag I keep it in she comes running.And yes...it works. Combine this with another product I thought just had to be BS ...... http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000U8HN5W/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 Proden Plaqueoff Animal . And my darling squirrel is kissing sweet again. Well....as sweet as you can get with an animal that licks it's butt....LOL"
3,Toothbrush too big,The toothbrush was way too big for my pets mouth. Unless you have a large dog it will not work. An infant toothbrush works alot better on a small dog.
5,My dog loves it.,The beef flavor makes my dog actually come over and think he is getting a treat. He will hold out his paw and start lickinghis lips when we get his toothbrush ready. Awesome.
4,fail,"Well my dog hates me now. Tried to brush her teeth! Let her smell the beef toothpaste first she wouldnt lick it off my finger and then went to open her mouth she immediately started gagging and barfed twice......... hadn't done anything yet. Anyway I used the finger brush and her mouth was on lock down with snot pouring out her nose. She hates it and her breath is horrid, she needs it done. Cant say its the item, it seems good. Paste made in USA, brushes in China but the finger brush has a VERY strong plastic odor to it."
4,The Title Says it All!,"Recorded shortly before the untimely death of founding member O'Kelly Isley, ""Masterpiece"" is an album that attempts to present the rhythm & blues/funk group in a different light. It almost succeeds with this collection of mostly ballads. I feel that the group and their label at the time were trying for crossover success but didn't quite make it.That withstanding, the album is noteworthy for the following tunes: ""May I?"" ""My Best Was Good Enough,"" ""If Leaving Me is Easy,"" ""Colder Are My Nights,"" and a cover of the Charlie Rich hit ""The Most Beautiful Girl in the World.""Although the production relies a little too heavily on the strings (Hey! It is called ""Masterpiece!""), the ""soul"" of the group comes forth with the superb vocal work of lead Ronald Isley."
3,Coleman Coffee Pot,"The coffee pot arrived in excellent condition. The only thing I'm disappointed in is that the lid is one piece, not the two piece with the little glass top. I like to watch my coffee percolate so I can check if the coffee is strong enough. This lid doesn't allow me to do that. I guess that is my own fault, but I thought they all came that way.Louise"
4,Enamelware percolator,"Simple and useful accessory. You can never have enough hot water in camp. We use this one to make tea, and to heat dish water. The lack of a clear top regulates this to the lesser tasks. I like to see when my coffee starts to percolate so I use one with a clear top for that. Overall a nice addition to the semi-primitive kitchen."
5,Coleman 9-Cup Coffee Enamelware Percolator (Blue),"I love this coffee percolator. I had another for over 20 years until I decided to make coffee one morning while camping but forgot to put water in it. :( Needless to say, the enamel got hot and cracked off in several places. This pot is identical in construction so I expect another 20 years out of this one. Great product! I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good camp coffee pot over some of the lesser priced pots because the double enamel coating really makes this percolator stand apart from the others."
2,Not so much,"It's extremely hard to open because the little knob on the top is not only tiny but badly shaped - nothing to grip. When it's hot, it's impossible to open. The first time I opened it, the top went flying out of my hands into the sink and chipped. Oddly enough, the chip on the knob made it easier to open. Go figure."
3,The Lid is Horrible,"Coleman always make good products, they are well made and last a long time BUT What IDIOT at Coleman designed this lid is beyond me. Besides the fact that it doesn't have a clear piece in the center like it should, the actual design of this one is so impractical it doesn't deserve to be a coleman! Even with a pot holder the shape of this lid is very difficult to hold and remove while HOT! ARGH!If you are a camper, even though the rest of this pot is great & solid and it makes a great cup of coffee.. yes the strainer is flimsy, but they all are for the most part and they still hold up; go with the bigger pot with the correct lid type. For me, it's only my husband and I, which is why this size was perfect and the other is too big. Its just frustrating, I expect more from coleman."
2,Not as nice as other Granitewear Products,"This product is unfortunately junk. The construction of it allows the coffee grounds to seep out of the percolator as soon as it boils. I purchased this after a trip with friends that owned a comparable GSI model of camp percolator. Up to this point, we had been using a Coleman French Press, which is a great product. Upon opening the box, I noticed that the internal tin 'coffee filter' didn't fit as tight as the model I had used and that there was no 'glass window' into the coffee pot to verify that the boiling water is turning to percolating coffee. Taking this on another week-long camping trip in mid-August 2012, I used this. Really a bad experience, unless you like coffee grounds in your finished product. After 6 days of gritty coffee, decided to return it and order the other brand of product. I would not recommend this product to a friend."
3,works fine - lid difficult to remove,"We used this just as a water pot (didn't put the percolator piece in) while camping a few weeks ago. It worked fine, but we had a really hard time getting the lid off. Thankfully there was no coffee grounds to clean out, so we could add fresh water via the spout easier than getting the lid off."
1,Very Poor replacement cartridge for BC-20,3/14/11Very Poor replacement cartridge for BC-20After repeated nozzle checks & wicking of cartridge this is a poor functioning replacement cartridge for Canon BC-20.I cannot use this to print even a nozzle check and need another cartridge asap.BRM
1,Misleading,"I was very disappointed when I opened the package to see NOT the Canon product pictured but a ""compatible cartridge"". THE PRODUCT PICTURE SHOULD BE OF THE ACTUAL PRODUCT YOU RECEIVE, NOT WHAT IT IS REPLACING UNLESS IT IS SPECIFICALLY STATED THAT IT IS ANOTHER BRAND.Once I opened the package, I went back to look at the product page and NOWHERE DOES IT STATE THAT WHAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY ORDERING IS A PTi CARTRIDGE!!!!!Do not order this item until they change the picture and/or state that you are not ordering a Canon product but are ordering a PTi product."
2,The average rating was 4 out of 5 stars! not very prestigous,Why would a movie store make a movie guide? They sell videos so don't you think there reviews would be a little one sided. I found them giving high ratings to Killer Klowns from Outer Space and such. It didn't even review many movies made before 1940. I guess those movies are just not very marketable. One good note is the rather large actor index. I would take Leonard Maltin over Blockbuster.
2,A shameless attempt to increase video rentals,"After browsing through this book a full ten minutes, I was unable to find a single video with a rating lower than two stars. Virtually every movie is given a hearty recommendation, even those which were universally panned by critics and viewers alike. Unless you intend to purchase this guide solely for the plot synopses or actor/director cross-references, it is virtually useless. My advice: stick with the IMDB, or, if you must have a book, get one by Ebert or Maltin instead."
3,"Editorializing, but OK","No one is going to agree with all of the movie reviews in this book, just as readers so often take issue with newspaper film critics. It would be nice to see a ""just the facts"" approach without quite so much editorializing on the individual movies, but with that point set aside, it is a decent guide. The indices in the back are perhaps the best feature, allowing you to look up a particular director or actor's filmography, and to find films by category (whereas the book as a whole is alphabetized by film title)."
4,Great short summaries to help pick a movie!,"This is a great guide to movies, one of the best you can get. The only thing I didn't like about the book was it reviewed EVERY movie ever made, almost, so there were a lot of old movies to search through. But overall, it is a great guide to movies! Every movie-lover should have a copy!"
2,Blockbuster never met a video they didn't like.,"This is more of a sales catalog of Blockbuster videos than a critical review to find those movies which are gems or worth two hours of your time. The result is that this book is designed to increase your rentals, not be more discerning in the process."
2,un réglement de compte,ce livre peut tre très intéressant pour les fans de Pater Banks. Pour les yesfans peut-tre moins la partie du début durant laquelle il est question de YES semble plus tre un réglement de compte et une mise en valeur du guitariste par rapport avec le groupe qu'autre chose.
2,"A book about API, not audio","This book was very disappointing. It is a book about programming audio APIs, not programming audio algorithms. The section on Advanced 3D Techniques is mostly a description of how to use EAX. There is little here that could not be gleaned from the documentation and examples that come with the APIs in question.This has only the barest whisper of theory. Just enough for someone to understand what a certain function in the provided APIs might mean. DSP, FFT and DCT are not even mentioned in the index! In all, this book is pretty much useful only to someone who doesn't want to deal with the included SDK documentation with DirectX Audio. Anyone working upon a different platform, or wishing to go beyond the basics of merely playing back samples should look elsewhere. Do you really need a 640 page long book just to figure out how to play back a sample?"
4,Bashmet's super-sensitive phrasing could use a little brashness,"Yuri Bashmet is a phenomenal musician and a superstar in his native Russia, despite the fact that his chosen instrument is the mild, rather doleful viola. Brahms's two late clarinet sonatas, transcribed for viola, are a staple of the repertoire. Among the versions I've heard, Bashmet's stands out for the beatuy of his tone--he never sounds creaky or buzzy--and the ultra-sensitive phrasing he applies everywhere.My reservation is that hearing sensitive viola playing gets a bit tiresome in this music, which is already among Brahms's most introverted, if not outright melancholy. I wish Bashmet had punched it up a bit. He needed an equal partner at the piano rather than the reticent, though highly musical Mikhail Muntian. Every mezzo and alto of repute has recorded Brahms's two songs with viola Op. 91, in luscious lullabye mode, and here the version with Bashmet and Larissa Diadkova is as beautiful as any."
3,Great movies....awful packaging!,"Hey Universal, ever heard of a keep case?I was horrified to see that Universal wasted the great cover art for this collection on a nasty cardboard box that's going to look good for about 10 minutes.It would have looked great in a regular double dvd case.Who makes these stupid decisions?Otherwise, a great collection."
3,DISC PROBLEMS!!!!!,"This is a fantastic set of films and extras. I hated to downrate this set, but the double-sided disc is just too much of a problem. I've been through 2 sets so far without getting a good one. Most of Universal's double-sided discs have worked fine for me, but not this one. This would have been a 5, if not for Universal's sloppy work. I went ahead and acquired the Son/Ghost of Frankenstein DVD so I could watch Son of Frankenstein without interruption."
3,The Original!,"This 1931 is the original Frankenstein movie, worth watching for its 'historical' value. However, it isn't that interesting nor terrifying; worse yet, the sequels are largely repeats of the original with new twists. The Mel Brooks/Gene Wilder remake, with Teri Garr, Cloris Leachmn, Marty Feldman, Madeline Kahn, and Gene Hackman is much better."
3,UESD VS. NEW (GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR).,"Did not like that one of the movies stuck on the same chapter, But i will replace with new not used."
5,Lovingly executed collection of Frankenstein flicks...,"Beautifully done collection of the classic Universal FRANKENSTEIN films. Of course the first two are the best--still chilling and mesmerizing; the subsequent sequels, however, are best only for inducing nostalgic memories of Saturday matinees gone by... Even, so Universal's done a terrific job of collecting and packaging the franchise.The bonus features are good, too, although the blatant tie-in with the new VAN HELSING movie is borderline obnoxious and can only be forgiven because of Stephen Somers's on eloquent infatuation with the original films.Definitely a keeper!"
2,good movie bad dvds,"Ive read other reviews that talked about playing issues with the legacy series. Ive bought several none of them will play all the way through without problems. Audio sync problems, picture freezing. Its not my player as all other dvds will play just fine.In other words the movies are great (if you like the old stuff) but the dvds themselves are of poor quality."
1,Frankenstein- The Legacy Collection,"Other reviews were right, The first disc was great the second froze up halfway thru the Son of Frankenstein... the disc was loose when I rcv'd it. and is useless junk."
4,I love Frankenstein!,"Boris Karloff is one of my favorite scary movie actors. Not just because he played Frankenstein's monsterand the Mummy, but because he also played a variety of other creepy guys that one might consider scary. Frankenstein is my favorite scary movie of all time and Dracula(1932) is my second."
5,The most amazing boxed set I've ever seen,"I quite literally spent days watching this boxed set, that's how amazing it was.The set includes: Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, Son of Frankenstein, Ghost of Frankenstein, and House of Frankenstein.The first three starring Karloff as the monster, the final four starring Lugosi as Igor. Each of the films includes the original theatrical trailer, artwork from the film, and commentary done by selected historians. And as if that wasn't enough, there's a short documentary as well!The documentary is about the history of Frankenstein in film, and also talks a bit about the Wolfman. There is a lot of focus on Karloff himself and how he got along with the crew and fellow actors. A lot of this was talked about by his very own daughter.This boxed set is definitely at the top of my list of things to buy and is DEFINITELY a must have. And, if you can't afford to buy it right now, definitely try and rent it. You will be floored."
5,Great collection,My two favs the original Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein are included in this dvd collection. The addition of the others enhanced the purchase but not the main focus of it. Enjoyed watching all including the special features - which are excellent on their own.
4,Frankensein-The Legacy Collection,"I received mine just like some of the others discribed... the tab was broken inside that held one of the DVDs in place. Hmm, wonder why all the trouble? Anyway, loved this classic. I grew up watching Frankenstein & the other classics at our halloween carnival. Don't expect the sound to be of the same quality as today's films, but it's all part of the experience. I would recommend this purchace to any Legacy film lover. Great addition to your collection!"
5,A frigtheningly good buy!,"The item was delivered quickly, and it was exactly as advertised! I grew up watching these films, and it is great to have them to watch whenever I want!"
5,Frankenstein Complete Love,This is what true old school horror was about and you can not go wrong with this collection. It takes you from start to finish and it engages you all the way!!!Worth all the money.
5,The Best Of The Legacy Collection,"Having owned all six of the Universal Studios Legacy Collection I can easily say that this is the best of them all. The quaity of the scripts and choice of actors in ALL films in this collection is what really sets it apart. Every movie has been wonderfully restored and the bonus features are plenty. If you either want to collect all of the Monster series, or just not sure which to buy, this is where to start! 5 stars all the way!"
5,The Voss,This is an excellent item for any fan of the classic horror films. It was packaged great and it contains all of the Frankenstein movies. A must for any collector!
5,Any fan of Frankenstein must have.,My son collects these movies. He really enjoys watching them and follows the trivia too.
1,What happened to the sound...?,"My problem with the Universal Monster DVD collections is that the sound is so poor. I know that these movies had sound (I think it was called Monomorphic) which tended to be very loud and very soft and would rise and drop in the movie soundtrack, but in all these movies, I guess the sound is not compatable with today's HD ditigal so you get movies that have a restored picture but the poor sound reception does not really work that well in your HD TV, and can ruin both the movie and your emjoyment of it."
3,Frankenstein - The Legacy Collection,It met all my expectations and was exactly as I remembered it to be. It's a typical 1930's collection and I was very glad to purchase it to add to my collection.
4,"Disputing the ""superiority"" of film 2","I do not feel Bride of Frankenstein (on this dvd) is really a better film than Frankenstein (ditto). What's better about film 2? Nothing. It's actually way more improbable than film one (with more monsters in a contrived siutuation), as the original had a certain surprising believability to it. Also, where is Dr. Frankenstein's old cootish baron of a father in BOF? And it is really dumb that the monster in film 2 actually manages to survive the burning windmill climax of the first picture. THat fabulous film one sequence is put into pointlessness in BOF. Other problems abound in the newer film. The actress playing bride Elizabeth in film 2 is different and in no way calls to mind the lady playing her from film one. The original film was obviously meant to be totally self-contained, there was no room for a sequel like this. I prefer film one."
2,"Lukewarm, mildly amusing entertainment","These pictures sure aren't scary. They can't be compared to modern horror flicks. So what does that leave you with? The original Frankenstein would have to be called a drama, and Bride of Frankenstein would be a comedy. Neither is that absorbing anymore. At least not for me. I know there are many people who love Bride of Frankenstein but it just didn't do much for me.I found both of these movies to be about as interesting as cold home fries. Put some ketchup on them and they can be okay, more or less.Each film ends with an apparent death of the monster, but each one leaves the possibility open that the monster didn't die, because his dead body isn't shown. Obviously he's just fine at the end.In Bride of Frankenstein, the bride makes her appearance very late in the film, and for only a brief time. I think more could have been done with the character. She would have made an interesting co-star in a 60s sitcom."
5,A completely entertaining book,"Storytellers is a suspense filled, fast-paced book that is hard to put down. Every reader can identify with Piper, the main character, who is torn between the way things are supposed to be and the way they really are. It's crisp yet brooding, almost poetic at times, while still raising goose bumps. I didn't want it to be over, even though the climax (totally unexpected) was very satisfying. All in all a completely entertaining book, and I'll be watching for more novels from this author."
3,Not Enough Bang for Buck...,"I recently purchased an ipod video and after about a week I decided to buy a protective case that would not obstruct the sleek design of the ipod itself. After searching high and low, I came across this simple plastic solution.There are pro's:The black beauty of my ipod is not obstructedheadphones and usb cords can be plugged in easilythe click-wheel is still usableit keeps the ipod protected from foreign objects and scratchesThere are con's:You can only buy a 3-pack.The screen is tinted with the red and gray coversI can't plug in my ""emergency charger"" (the 9v battery variety) while it is in the caseIt does not come with instructionsIt is a little bulkyIt suits my needs just fine, but I would rather it came in a 1 or 2 pack for less money."
4,Pretty Good,"I've had this case for about 3 months now and its worked perfectly. It isnt very hard to open the case as others have commented and the only things I didnt like about it was that the hole for the headphones is too small if you want to plug in anything but the ipod earphones, I had to use a drill to make the hole larger. The other thing I didnt like was that my ipod wont fit the dock on my ihome unless I take the case off. All in all it is a good product offering my ipod protection and it looks nice."
2,"Protects iPod from scratches, but not itself.","I bought these cases, expecting a nice look, and something to protect my iPod from scratches. They did both, but, the case it's self is NOT prone to scratches. It scratches EASIER than the iPod itself. I am now back to just carrying the iPod, without the case.I don't recommend these."
1,Don't buy this from Amazon.com!,Ordered this product from Amazon.com on March 7 and I still haven't got it today(March 15)! Terrible service!
4,How To Obtain The Owners Manual For This TV,"I have owned this model for over 3 years without any problems. I only paid $89.00 at a 'mega-electronics store'. Tonight (12/09/2005) my 'v-chip' locked up. I had lost the owners manual in 3 various moves! After a L=O=N=G search on Google, I found the owners manual online. It can be found here:http://support.apexdigitalinc.com/images/ATMonoManual061502.pdfHope this helps someone else!Don in Northville, NY, USA"
2,Pretty but not practical,"These towles were bought as a gift for me for my bridal shower. I thought they were really pretty and I used them in my spare bathrooms. Anyway, the first time that I washed them my washing machine was covered in tassles and so was everything else in them. This also happened the second time that I washed them. I checked first to see that they are washable, which they supposedly are, but I recommend that if you do purchase these towels then you use them purely for decoration."
1,Don't waste your money,"I love my Lampe Berger, but this Ocean Breeze fragrance smells horrible. I burned it once and then dumped it right out. Can't really describe the smell, but it's definitely not the ocean, and it's definitely not an ocean breeze -- at least not an ocean you would want to visit."
5,A Great Heldentenor!,"I recently happened upon Gunther Treptow by coincidence; searching for videos of Wintersturme. Neither I nor the uploader himself knew anything of the tenor. Gunther Treptow was a German tenor, who quickly established himself as a leading heldentenor of his generation. Besides Wagner which this recording includes, he also did the following (also included in German): Max in Der Freischutz, Steva in Jenufa, Canio from Pagliacci and Otello as Otello. Now I like this tenor for his smooth you could say voice. A great Heldentenor, my favorite to listen to after James King's Siegmund. I can't stand Melchior's voice; Treptow is easier on the ears (in my opinion.)Though if you're interested in this CD, buy the disk. Some songs are more clear then others; the best song is ""Notung! Notung!"" which is only avaiable on the CD purchase. Overall, an underrated Heldentenor, today."
4,Decent Wheel Kit,"The wheel kit is pretty sturdy with great tires. Had to make some adjustments to fit my unit but that is to be expected for a ""universal"" kit."
2,Universal???,"Nice made product but it's not universal, make sure how you want to handles if the gas tank is on top of the generator the handles might not work for you. The wheels fit but can't mount the handles."
4,wheel kit,"The wheel kit was not what I expected, but I did make it workThe tires were just right for the job"
4,Good information,"Good information in an easily accessible format. This book does a good job of covering chute skiing in the Wasatch. It will get you pointed in the right direction, especially for the more popular descents."
3,Customer Service,"Received the textbook. Researhed for a student's transcript, only to get another student's textbook. What ever happened to customer service? Never had so many problems orderding textbooks. Had to return four, trash another three. Will not likely order any more products!"
4,Take Joy!,"This charming book is full of inspiring ideas on how to make the most out of life by creating standards and honoring the sacredness of time. As with all of Alexandra Stoddard's books, this is for the optimistic person who delights in the romance and wonder of everyday living."
2,More of the same,"If you're looking for something new and fresh from Ms. Stoddard, you won't find it in this book. This is plainly a re-hash of several of her previous books. She needs to realize that not everyone can afford to live the lifestyle she is fortunate to live, and there are others of us who could but have chosen not to do so.The ideas in this book are not attainable by a good segment of people, however, some of the ideas could be applied to the lives of everyone and some could be changed and tweaked to fit the budget of the average middle class person.Caring for others, taking time for oneself, these are not new ideas. They have been around for at least 2,000 years.If you like reading Ms. Stoddard's books, then buy this one, but there are other books available, even some of her own, that are better."
2,More of the Same,"Okay, Ms. Stoddard is who she is and probably means well in writing about her idea of living well. I have read her other books, and I think ""Living a Beautiful Life"" is the best of the lot. I agree with the other reviewers that she seems pretentious, but perhaps she is targeting those who actually have the time and money to follow her suggestions and play in her league. At the same time, so many people are aspirational and want to read about the lifestyle they dream of having--even if odds are that they never will.I found ""Simple Abundance: A Daybook of Comfort and Joy"" by Sara Ban Breathnach more inspiring and realistic. I bought it in 1995 and still have a look at it now and then. So, if you're trying to carve out a little extra grace, pleasure, and serenity for yourself, that's the book I would recommend."
3,"I haven't heard this yet,,,","so this obviously isn't a review. I just thought I'd say that this band's breakup probably has something to do with Carl Michael Eide, the drummer, falling off a 5-story building a few months back. He was also the drummer for Dodheimsgard and the frontman for Ved Buens Ende and Virus. I hear he is now walking with a cane. I don't know if this is true but if so, it's good news since doctors weren't sure he'd ever walk again at first. Anyway, why did this band change their name back from Cadaver Inc. to just Cadaver? confusing!P.S. if you haven't heard 666 International, Carheart, and Written in Waters you need a edumacation!!!"
4,Guys'n Dolls,Wonderful memories. Excellent Group. Hard To Find CD and songs. Very Good Quality of sound. Amazon is a good place to find Oldies
2,Loved it till it broke,"Loved the easy hook-up, easy use of remote, looked nice and played fine. Purchased 11-06-03, and the DVD part stopped without warning 05-29-04. The kids never touched this one; it was all for Mommy and therefore subject to only gentle use. Now if you put a DVD in, it takes a long time to load, then comes up ""ERR."" And now the door makes a grinding noise when it opens. Severely disappointed, heartbroken, etc. Apparently VCRs, DVD players, and these combo units are meant to be disposable - work six months and then discard. If so, we may as well disregard brand names and buy the cheapest ones available. Forget quality, reliability, and pride of workmanship - those are things of the past."
1,My Return Rate - 100%,I have been shipped 2 of these units. Neither one worked as the DVD draw would not open. I called Toshiba and they did not seem at all surprised. I've done well with other Toshiba products but would hesitate to get anything from them going forward.
4,very solid unit,"Previously, I have tried Panasonic and GoVideo combos. Each had its flaws mostly in the VCR domain. The Toshiba unit records well and keeps the colors of the TV faithfully even through the RF input. The only problem is that the beginning of the recording is not flawless, with some lines that quickly disappear, but the same thing generally happens with other systems. DVD watching is easy and the quality is outstanding (I have not even tried the component video). Contrary to some users, I don't have any problem with the remote or VCR programming. The only inconvenience I see is that after programming the VCR you have to press the Rec button; some other systems do not require it. Overall, for a rather small price you get a very solid and nicely designed unit with quality performance both with the VCR or DVD player."
5,Great DVD,"Awesome DVD player. Personally, I thought Combos are over priced and troublesome, but this unit is GREAT!Plays all media as described (DVD+/-R, VCD, JPG CD-RW, etc)! Very nice. I have had mine for about 2 months and have played about 200 hours of movies (for my kids) with no problems.I would recommend this to anyone looking for there first player, or someone looking to upgrade."
1,Another DVD door bad,"Must be cronic with Toshiba. Hooks up easy and looks great,but the DVD door won't open. Didn't even try a tape in it.Packed it up and returned it for the Philips combo.Will write a review on it after I try it.This was a Christmas gift from my daughter, and I think she wasmore disappointed that it didn't work than I was.Shame on you, Toshiba!"
1,Piece of junk,DVD player door would not open up. Setup was terrible. Took back to Best Buy. I wish I had read the reviews before buying this product.
1,Defective unit,"I was disappointed to receive a defective Toshiba SD-V391 unit. The DVD drive door would not open, either with the remote or manually. I therefore have no idea of the DVD picture quality. The VCR playback was average. Toshiba Customer Support was slow to respond, and talked down to me (""Was the unit plugged in?""), but eventually confirmed that the unit was indeed defective and authorized a return."
1,also dead on arrival,"Dvd door did not work out of box. Sent back to amazon,maybe replactment will work.I bought this because of toshiba quality.Wrong again."
1,DVD Door Laughs At You,"Like others, DVD drive door would not open, made annoying grinding noise as if the gears were not engaging properly. Piece O junk in my view. Sent this turkey packing back to Amazon."
4,Straight shooter.,"This is exactly what it's supposed to be: A dependable, functional unit that plays everything you put in it. I've had mine for 2 years, with only a couple of hick-ups (discs that delay ejection). Picture quality is excellent. Connections are plentiful. And the ability to dub from DVD to VHS is welcome and works."
5,Even works in my convertible,"I've had little success in finding a blue tooth headset that people could hear me through. My convertible, even with the top on, has more noise than most cars these days. This is great. Works easily and effectively. Better than any other I've owned. That being said, I don't think anything can replace talking directly through the phone, but for safety sake it does the trick. Comments: The ear piece is a little hard to get on, but on the other side at least it doesn't keep falling off my ear like all of the others I've used. It is sometimes hard to find where the button is to press. It has only a very slight bump to indicate where to press to begin or end calls. It is probably prettier with out a large button, but I could like a little more there to make it easy to find. All in all, I like it."
2,Good sound quality - Poor design,The sound quality is very good however I cannot imagine that the design engineers ever actually used the product. I am on my second unit and the spring loaded charging connector would not stay on either one. The design has to be the poorest I have ever seen. The plastic tabs that hold it on are small and flexible so the spring loaded contact pins push the connector right off the phone. The problem is even worse in a warm auto.The buttons are difficult to find when the headset is on your ear and because of the design of the ear clip it is difficult to slide on the ear. When you finally get it on your ear the earbud is uncomfortable and the feeling is that the headset will fall off your ear any second.This could be a good product from an electronics standpoint but the mechanical design is horrible. The design engineers really should have tried the product before marketing it.
5,Noise shield that works,"My wife and I both use a Jawbone. The auto volume and noise shield features are the best that I have ever used. Just turn it on and use it. The earloops break so have a couple of extras. Be careful when removing the charger. Do not pull off. Bend like breaking a pencil in half and the charger comes off easily. Even though I wish the Jawbone was a little more heavy duty, IT IS THE BEST SOUNDING BLUE TOOTH AROUND"
1,"Good sound, bad interface, bad product","Red the reviews and I was attracted to the noise suppression technology. Got the headset, and it has amazing sound and lives up to removing noise. However the buttons on this thing don't provide good tactile feedback and operating the thing is very difficult. Putting it on your ear is difficult. The proprietary power connector is a pain (what about a mini USB jack) as you need to get more (for use in the office) or carry it around with you.Once you get it working, it works fine; but somebody needs to revisit the industrial design and put some real buttons on this thing that you can tell when they have been punched, and a standard USB jack. Would also be nice to have a mute function (missing). While the technology and specs are good on the Jawbone, the industry design is pleasing but not useable; in-fact I would just conclude that the usability of the product was ignored. Wouldn't buy this product again."
4,"Incredibly awesome, but...","The Jawbone is really the technological wonder everyone raves about. It blocks out background noise clearly better than the Motorola and Plantronics line items I have compared.One big BUT...I could not get the thing to stay on my ear. Despite the three different earpieces and two over ear hooks for each ear, I could not get the Jawbone to stay on. One head shake and it was gone.The websites list ways to use Jabra earpieces to get your Jawbone to stay in place, but to me this means the manufacturer didn't do all their homework and I had to return it."
2,iPhone 3G disappointment,"Bought this for my new iPhone 3G, only to find not compatible. (despite product lit)"
2,Not as advertised.,"First, the noise shield does not work well at all. The video on the Jawbone website is a complete joke. Try it yourself. People can easily hear background noise and even things like passing cars. There is no wind shielding for the unit so even a breeze from walking fast is picked up. It does not adjust for volume in noisy environments well at all, although its supposed to do that.maybe mine is simply defective, but i doubt it. it looks good though.NOTE: I got a second unit. It completely does not shield background noise. Even minor background noise is audible. While the incoming audio quality is good, it appears all the issues are with outbound sound quality. I emailed Jawbone, since the eliminated telephone tech support.They did not respond."
2,Jawbone 1 Bluetooth,"I was very disappointed when I received the headset. The ear loops are uncomfortable, and the earbuds are just about useless. I couldn't find any of them that fit well enough to block out enough sound to be able to hear my conversation. Glad I didnt spend a lot of money on it."
3,heavy and clunky,"Sound is OK, ""pairing"" worked fine, but the thing is heavy, clunky and after about 15 minutes, my ear hurt and I had to take it off. I gave it away..."
3,Not quite as good as I thought it would be,"Fit to ear is unsatisfactory. Tried combinations of earpieces and clips, ""settled for"" ""least unsatisfactory."" Outgoing audio is hit & miss; most callers complain they can't hear me as well as when I switch to handset. Incoming audio not as loud as handset (possibly attributable to mediocre ear fit). I wish the periodic ""I'm on"" flash could be bypassed so I don't look like a beacon at night (taping it over seems like a cheesy move). Not recommended without extensive trial period."
1,review of jawbone bluetooth,"Sorry to say, this device drops calls after about ten minutes in use. In other words, the person with whom I am talking to can no longer hear my voice. I must then hang up and repeat the call. Approximately ten minutes later, the same problem occurs again. Also, it is entirely to heavy. I could not secure the device in my ear comfortably. The bluetooth is heavy, cumbersome and I am forced to remove the device from my ear after a short period of time (about an hour)."
2,Got Boned by Jawbone,"Why does this Jawbone bluetooth answer incoming calls on its own ? For some reason incoming callers will ""occasionally"" begin speaking without any prompting or phone being activated to do so. It has lead to some embarrasing moments."
2,"Jawbon, Bluetooth",The headset works like they say and is easy to use. However it is very heavy and does not fit the ear well at all. After wearing it for about 10 mins or so my ear would hurt so bad I just could not keep it on. O well maybe I can get half my money back on ebay.
2,Did it really do that?,The day received the head set I noticed that I had three right earwires and one left. I was not happy about this because I use the left. The first day I wore the headset the wire turned colors. I know the chemistry of individual bodies is different but a coating on the wires could have eliminated this problem. I wrote the company about my concerns but never received a response. My son liked the look of the headset but I would not recommend he purchase it.
1,Close but not close enough,"First off ,,to big,, second buttons to hard to push,,flat out did not like it,"
1,Jawbone wireless headset,After several weeks of frustration -- and really wanting this headset to work -- I gave up and returned it. I found many difficulties with using it and very poor transmission quality.I hope it is improved and then I may try it aain.
2,Overhyped,"For all the ear buds and ""hooks"" provided, does not fit well in ear. Miniature on/off button embedded in piece makes it feel like braille, hard to find. Also hard to know if device is really off if you turn it off while in ear (white light appears if u turn it off in your hand) Ear-piercing sound when activating, hence don't activate while in ear."
3,Is this the best bluetooth has to offer?,This is the second Jawbone I have tried and this one performs no better than the first. I hear constant popping and static in the ear-piece and most of the time the person on the other end asks me if I am driving in a convertible or flying a kite even though I am sitting on my couch without so much as a ceiling fan in the same room. I have a $30 Motorola H550 that performs better. I don't know if I have gotten two bad ones or if my phone doesn't like the jawbone or what. Extremely disappointed....again
4,Z9?????????? Whatever,"I tried 4 BlueAnt Z9 headsets on two different phones and they were horrible. They isolated background noise with perfection and then amplified it.The Jawbone?It rocks, PERIOD."
2,Not all that,"It looks stylish, but I don't believe it's any better than your average bluetooth set that costs less. I don't have a real point of reference here though, as this is my first bluetooth set. It claims to block out surrounding noise; it does not. It claims to block out wind noise. It does not. On a slightly windy day while walking on the beach, the person on the other end of the call could not hear me due to wind noise. I think that it was a little high priced, and does not deliver as the description claims. Also, it does not always charge completly, as the charger sometimes needs to be wiggled around before the charging light will come on."
2,Great Sound Poor Earpiece,"I purchased this headset based on the sound reviews. I ignored the negative comments about the earpiece to my regret. I thought I had figured out how to manage placing the headset around my ear without going through too much wrangling. To my dismay, after only several months of use, I broke the earloop off at the point of entry to the headset rendering the headset without any way to secure it to my ear. If you buy this headset or already own one, be extra careful when placing it on the ear. I am hoping Aliph will replace mine."
2,The good and bad,I thought it was kinda big...My ears are weird so it just did not fit on or in my ear. For those who dont usually have problems with ear buds etc...it will work for you. Also I think the one i got was defective...but it is a good product...top of the line. I rate the technology a 10!
4,pretty good,"this is my 1st bluetooth wireless headset, so i don't have anything to compare it to. i feel the jawbone has good reception, clarity, and it's very easy to use.the only thing i don't like is that there's no perfect ear bud and ear cuff to fit my ear. i have normal-shaped ears too. they give you 4 each to mix and match, but none of them are perfect.no other complaints."
4,very good,I received the Jawbone and immediately started using it and found it to be as adverstised.
4,jawbone review,"I love my new red jawbone. Not only is it stylish, it works great. I had a bit of a time figuring out how to work the sound dampening part and it felt a little odd at times until I got the right ear bud. But know it's like a part of me and I truly have been assimilated.Ladysun"
1,Not Recomended,I received it in good physical condition in the actual case but I could not speak on it. I could only hear!
4,Jawbone Noise Reduction Bluetooth Headset,"I purched this headset for my wife who drives alot and uses here cell phone while driving. Normally I cannot hear her for all the car and road noise on her other Motorola Bluetooth headset because it would pickup too much noise. Anyway,I was amazed how much backgroud noise was cut off using the Jawbone and I can finally hear her! The only negitive she has found is that it is hard to fit to her ear,even though they supply several different attachments for the ear. Also,it is a little more heavy they the Motorola. All in all, thumbs up!!"
3,Jaw Bone,"The JawBone is o.k. I have had it for a month. It does the basic things that a blue tooth should do, answer calls and voice dial calls. I do think the noise reduction is a little over-hyped. It would be nice if the device announced incoming callers names. Given the size of the device and the price, I should have purchased something with bettter technology."
2,Disappointed,"this bluetooth headset is a disappointment. It's really difficult to put on and off and then when it's on it doesn't feel secure. I am a sales consultant in and out of the car all day. I don't wear my headset into a client's business so I need easy on and off. Additionally, the rubber earbuds break off their metal stem. It's too bad, because the audio quality is probably the best I've ever used and I've had many headsets over the years. I'm going back to Plantronics."
2,"Good Quality, bad design","While the jawbone is suppose to have this great ""military-grade tecjnology"", it isn't too much better than a $20 motorola. Unless the piece is continually touching the cheekbone, the sound/voice cuts in and out.As well, there is no size adjustments. Aparently nobody told the people at jawbone that all ears are not made the same size. Becase they don't fit every ear. In my case, it's too big. the part that goes around my ear is not adjustable, and the part that goes in does not have adapters to adjust for smaller ear canals. As a result, any time i turn my head too quickly, or lean my head to one side, the jawbone falls out of my ear, and often, off my head completely.So, for $100+....not a great buy. There's plenty of $20-50 ear pieces that will do just as good, not cut out, and can adjust to your head."
2,Wish it were better,"I had high hopes for the Jawbone. I love the aesthetics and I completely bought into the noise reduction technology claims. While it is an improvement in terms of hearing conversations and having folks here me (while walking on busy Manhattan streets), it is extremely uncomfortable. I've tried all of the different ear piece configurations and wearing this device for more than 15 minutes is out of the question. Given that most of my conference calls last an hour, I'll be looking for another solution."
2,Un-intuitive and hard to use,"I bought this headset for iPhone 4 based on a very positive review I found on the internet; the reviewer who had tested about 10 BlueTooth headsets for iPhones found this one to be the absolute best.I don't agree. First of all its hard and un-intuitive to place on the ear, it's hard to understand the use of the 4 alternative earclips, and to change them requires so much force you wonder if you are about to break the device. Same for the non-standard connector for the USB-based charger (seems to be an excellent candidate for the ongoing competition ""Who-can-make-non-standard-USB-connector-no.-100""), once put on it is so hard to pull off again after charging that you are wondering what breaks next.It random connects/disconnects with the iPhone, but I haven't been able yet to determine if this is due to the Jawbone or to the iPhone's poor BlueTooth implementation - or a combination.When in place and functioning it functions fine though!I can't recommend this item."
4,"Roseville, CA","The Jawbone rocks when it comes to clarity, functionality and weight. The only issue I have is the ear piece doesn't fit exceptionally well and I've broke (by bending) the wire piece that goes over the ear. Even with these little problems, I still love this headset."
5,Wonderful Bluetooth!!!!,Well I'm a Californian and I now have to use a headset with my phone when ever I am in my car so I thought it was time to upgrade my Bluetooth headset. I had a cheap Motorola and some other one with a cable from the earpiece to the mic that clipped to your shirt or hung from a lanyard. I am very impressed with the Jawbone so far!!!! I even was able to use it on my Vespa ET2 (scooter) while driving down the street and my husband was able to hear me. The technology in this little piece of wonderfulness is amazing. I love my Jawbone and I will recommend it to others!
3,almost perfect,"I bought this unit mainly because I hoped a latest-generation unit would have some VOLUME! Alas, it was not to be. In a quiet environment, volume is fine, but around any noise, even when manually maxxing the volume, I still struggle to hear my caller. Everybody I speak WITH says the sound quality is outstanding (so the noise-filtering feature seems to work well). The unit does fit like a glove, the most comfortable fit I've ever experienced. First unit I've ever had that I forget that I'm wearing it.Bought the red unit, love the look to it, very classy looking. If it only had a volume control that could I adjust up to DEAFEN, I'd give it an easy 5 stars."
3,Stopped working,I loved it for the first month but then it just stopped working....so I am stuck with a 100.00 piece of plastic!
3,"Good sound, terrible fit.","Overall I like the color, the look, and the sound quality of the Jawbone. It does get a little fuzzy if I stray too far from the phone into another room nearby but my biggest problem is the fit. My father and I both have Jawbones, his black, mine red, but we both have a problem with it fitting and staying on our ears. He is a much larger man than I am and we both had trouble keeping the set on. I prefer to use my old cord set which fits in like a regular music headphone to my Samsung SYNC to the Jawbone which continuously slips off my ear and outside of my ear canal far too easily."
1,Don't buy this if....,"You are left eared. The 90 degree turn to fit the ear bud turns the wrogn way so it pops off too easily. The sound form this device is decent, but not worth the price for all the hassel of putting this on my ear and taking it off again. Also the earbud kept falling off when not in use. Poor design. I purchased this because it had so many good reviews, which is why I'm writting this one.Great sound if you can keep it on your ear and keep it from falling apart on you. So for me it was a total waste of my money."
1,not worth at any price,"Did not care for fit or looks. I found it never looked right, no matter how I put it on."
3,works great but..........,"The reception is the best of any bluetooth device I've used. Unfortunately, the earpiece hurts my ear, as it isn't as soft as it could be, and doesn't fit ""my"" ear as well as it might for more comfort."
4,Best Headset Ever,"I purchased Jawbone headset a couple months ago and I am totally thrilled. At first I hesitated because it is a bit pricey, but after a few phone calls I discovered it is worth every penny. I rarely get people telling me they can not hear me - and no one comments on background noises. Background noices such as radio playing, window down, other people talking in the same room, etc are not noticed by the person I am speaking with.One downfall is that the charger is unlike any other and the price of an additional charger is a bit steep."
1,Do not even consider buying one,I loved the design. I order one and did not work. I order a second one that functioned correctly only one week.Thanks to Amazon I changed the first one and I am sending the secon one back today.
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I found the Jawbone very difficult to put on and to keep on. In fact, I have no experience to report regarding sound quality because it fell off before I had a chance to try it out."
1,Should not have purchased.,This was a mistake and a expensive one at that. It is difficult to use when it is in your ear and not worth the money. Better products on the market like the Jabra JX10. The Jawbone would only be good if you are constantly in a noisy area when using a cell phone.
5,Great listening for the daily commuter,"If you have a long daily commute, this makes for great listening when you're ready to take a break from whatever's on the radio or your collection of music CDs.If you enjoy Shakespeare, you'll like this set. I certainly did. And because it's a classic, you can be sure you'll listen to it again and again.-- RuthAnn"
1,Try another one,Overpriced and under performing. This produces splinters at the end requiring you to sand it before use. Try another one. Higher quality ones are sold at retailers where you can inspect them and see if they are good for around the same price.
1,back scratcher,This item is not very well made. I would not recommend that annyone should buy it. It will snag your clothes and cut you if you are not careful.
1,JUNK!,"This item arrived on time, but the box was way too big for the product and it looked like it was used as it was dirty or taken out of the garbage. It wasn't wrapped in anything protective and didn't have any tags on it. The balls for massage fell off right out of the box. That being said, the price I paid for it will not validate postage to send it back. It is going in the garbage. I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Scratcher,Does exactly what it is intended to do. It scratches..kind of. I find that it doesn't scratch as well as I would like but I just sanded the hand down so it was alittle sharper.
5,its a back scratcher,"Don't know how this could go wrong, but it works fine. The back scratcher hasn't broken. Have no complaints about it."
4,Sturdy & Reliable,This back scratcher has come to be a favorite for everyone in the house. Very pleased.
3,Hand made and you get what you pay for.,The thing works great as a back scratcher! But if you want to use the three rolling massage wheels on the other end you may be rolling the dice. The one we got had the holes for the axle for the middle wheel drilled off center. This causes the wheel to rub against the handle and not roll at all. Since one wheel doesn't roll you can't use that end since it hurts to drag a stuck wheel across your back. It's a great back scratcher for the money though!
1,Bamboo scratcher,I only wish it were sharper. I use it often and it doesn't quite get the itch. Perhaps you should include a file to sharpen?
4,Nice little back scratcher,"I bought this for my husband about 3 years ago. He has a small collection and uses them all the time. He particularly liked this one because he said the ""teeth"" were sharper than most he'd used, so it did a better job. I'd read some reviews that you could get splinters from it, and they were right. He had to take off several little splinters and smooth out some rough edges before he could use it, but once he did that, it was good to go. He never did use the massager on the other end. It seemed a bit worthless. I only paid about $3 for this, so it was definitely worth the money. I'm a little ticked off that he left it behind on a business trip..."
5,Back scratchers - excellent stocking stuffers,"I used the the back scratchers as stocking stuffers for co-workers, and friends. It was very well received and such a practical gift."
5,Backscratcher/massager,This order came quickly and unfortunately a piece of it was broken off. I emailed the seller and they responded immediately and told me they would send another one. Sure enough I received a new one in the mail a few days later.
1,wood backscratcher,The wood used in making these backscratchers was very crude. Not smoothed out to make it easy to hold in ones hand. Disappointed in the quality.
1,Pathetic Company - Pathetic Product,"My second posting. Amazon wouldn't post my first review. I order 6 backscratchers. They sent only one. Upon complaint, they said they were shipping but never did. 2nd complaint, same promise, no action. 3rd complaint - same. Don't order from these theives unless you enjoy processing credit card charge-backs."
1,Poor quality,What's can I say? If you're looking to add splinters to your back and fingers from usage then this may be just the back scraper you're looking for.
4,great customer service,When I originally received the back scratcher it was poorly packaged. I left some negative feedback on the packaging and received a phone call apologizing for the poor packaging and asking if I would like a refund or another complimentary back scratcher. The customer service was great!! The representative that I talked to was polite and apologetic and personalized the email that he sent me as well. I received the replacement package very quickly and in proper packaging and couldn't be happier.
3,Back Scratcher,The back scratcher is really nice except it needs a little sanding. It's a little rough on the back.
3,"A solid product, but prone to splintering","The packaging was not great and since the product was properly bashed about in the postal system: this created splinters along part of the scratcher. Easy to file down. Otherwise, this is a great little scratcher. Measures 18 inches from top to bottom."
1,Very cheap material.,"Of course, I wasn't expecting anything spectacular for this price but this thing is made of really cheap material and the wood was chipping off from lot of places."
5,Back Scratcher...AWESOME,"This is one of the best $3 purchases I've ever made. I literally use this thing probably 10 times a day. For anyone who isn't extremely oddly flexible, GET ONE OF THESE!!"
3,"Okay, but...","The back scratcher is fine but I purchased two of them and one of them was broken around the top. Since the cost was so little, i decided not to return it."
1,you get what you pay for,"What can I really say? It's a wooden back scratcher. It was cheap and I got what I paid for. It's not in any way beautifully handcrafted and it doesn't have a nice smooth finish on it. It's a piece of wood with a clear coat on it that is the consistency of a clear nail polish coating. I bought it as a stocking stuffer for Xmas and it will probably rarely every be used, but for just a few dollars I filled a little space in that stocking."
1,Not Satisfied,"I ended up returning this product, it was in horrible shape. The scratcher end was splintered and the rollers were on such a thin piece of wood they looked like they were about to break. A few weeks later I saw the same thing at a dollar store. Don't waste you money."
3,Sound content let down by layout and design,"The book has interesting things to say, and explains a number of tricky Perlisms quite nicely (e.g. eval() for exception handling).Sadly, the design, typography and layout of the book are average, with confusing diagrams, poor choice of fonts, and some silly iconography.The result is that this book is a worthwhile front to back read, but as a reference or 'companion' you would be better off with 'Effective Perl Programming'."
4,"Excellent, lucid text","Moderately experienced and seasoned Perl programmers looking for another book to contemplate on their way toward Perl mastery can't go wrong with this one. Nigel's prose is thoughtful and clear, and so is his Perl. And what do you know, the book is beautifully typeset as well! A little offbeat at times, but on the other hand it's helpful to experience a fresh new viewpoint. Useful and highly recommended."
3,"good for the price, but not the shipping costs!","Tie is good and is as advertised, but i didn't realize that it was going to be shiny instead of a matte fabric. The shipping cost was way too much for just an envelope."
3,red tie,"It is indeed a red tie.... It's a skinny, short red tie. I went ahead and ordered 365 of them just so I can have one a day. Next year I'm going with the green."
4,Fun and Informational,My 7 year old son adores zebras so I found this to be a great book for him. The story is very cute as the characters try to determine how a zebra gets its stripes. It is also informational in explaining how all zebras have different stripe patterns.
2,Looks like the real thing; don't be fooled.,"I purchased a pair off these clogs thinking that the lower price (almost half of the German made original brand)was a bargain. However, the cheap Chinese imitation is just that. The interior lining completely came apart in both shoes. While the exterior ""nubuck"" leather is wearing well and the rubber soles are fine, the shoe bed liner is completely coming apart after less than a year of use. Save money and buy the German made original which this shoe is trying to copy. Needless to say, I am very disappointed in this cheap immitation a shoe. I have owned three pairs of the German made originals and thought that this Eurocrapia would be a suitable subsitute; unfortunately it does not hold a candle to the original."
1,Not a Romika knockoff & terrible return policy,"I bought these for my husband as a replacement for the Romika Mokasso clogs he's worn daily for 10 years. They ran small--had to return at my expense for a bigger size. He wore them around house & they make his feet sweat which the Romika's never did. Now I have to pay again to have them shipped back to Footwise. So with the $25 in shipping charges I've lost, I could have bought the more expensive Romika's in the 1st place for same cost. Oh well, live & learn. Be careful if you're buying these to replace Romika's because you'll be disappointed."
3,My fake nordics,The clogs are too big but I'm not going to return them. I had ordered a smaller size initially and it cost me $14.00 to return them. I don't want to incur the return charges a second time. I've learned my lesson. Don't buy shoes on the net. Ordering was simple but the sizes were limited and returning is expensive. Not a positive experience.Jim Hutchins
1,"""Ne Me Gusta"" ""No Mo Monkey-on-da-beh""","Direct quotes from 2 1/2 yr old bilingual twins. Don't like it, don't want to see ""monkeys on the bed"" song -which normally they love. This is basically a recording of a daycare/playgroup run by a non-native Spanish speaker. It's probably much more fun live than on a video that looks like YouTube or cell phone quality.The idea of Boca Beth as a virtual bilingual playgroup is a GREAT! But it's probably a stretch to think kids without other Spanish resources would be able to go beyond repeating a few words. They also might have trouble understanding a native speaker.Animal Planet in Spanish is better."
3,"Cute animals, cute idea, horrible Spanglish...","Coming from a bilingual home, I thought this would be a great addition to my daughter's repetoire. The DVD is cute in its presentation...with the animals, children, etc., but the quality is not great. It looks like a teacher-made home video. More importantly for me, the Spanish in the DVD is spoken with a very bad American accent, which is not what I want my daughter to pick up on. The English is perfect, but the Spanish is clearly spoken by someone who does not have a good Spanish accent. The DVD sounds like an American who just happened to have the Spanish translations. It does not sound like a natural Spanish voice, but more of someone reading off of a card. I was not impressed. My daughter watches it but does not love it as much as some of her other videos (like Brainy Baby Spanish). I give it a mediocre rating."
5,Boca Beth Rocks in Our House,"My girls are always excited to play with Boca the puppet and the instruments. We have the whole Boca Beth program and with this particular dvd they like the parts when they can sing and dance with the other children. Their favorite happens to be Cinco Monitos (5 Little Monkeys). It's so cute watching them pull out their bean bag and jump and down on it like the children in the video. I'm happy with my purchase because the songs in the whole program cover many different topics, my girls are learning Spanish, and they're having fun doing it."
5,Excellent,"The art work and stickers in these workbooks are cute, and also help with remembering the Hebrew alphabet. Children are fascinated with them. The workbook is made with quality paper and holds together well, even with active youngsters."
4,"archie comics, it's not.","definately an alternative to modern comics. it's like archie comics. if archie was a cute little dead girl, veronica was her evil vampire possessed dolly, and jugghead was a demon bounty hunter. and instead of richie rich droping by, it's the all forces of hell en mass. ok so it's nothing like archie but it's still one hell of a read."
3,Lenore one cute little dead girl,"Although Lenore did not match up to my standards,i still laughed unwittedly at it,the cute antics of the little dead girl is enough to put a smile on anyones face....there is also a guest comic called little dead cutie by Jhonen Vasquez in this comic,"
3,bland,It took less than an hour to get through. I was expecting something more detailed. Live and learn i guess.
5,Great entertainment.,"...Lenore is a cute little dead girl who has very macabre adventures quite frenquently. Other bizarre creature are documented too and Dirge litters his comics with fairy tales gone wicked. As for how lenore stands up to Johnny the Homicidal maniac, I'll tell you this: Lenore may not be as ""philisophical"" as JTHM, but at least you can read this book without getting a brain seizure from ridiculously cluttered art."
1,D'oh!,"I got really excited when I saw that Slave Labor Graphics, the publishers of a personal favorite, Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, put out a new book, so I decided to give it a shot. After reading this trade in a matter of thirty minutes, I felt as though I had just read absolutely nothing. The artwork is poor, the concepts are childish and simple, and the storyline is flimsy and...poor. Lenore is the type of crude Goth-nonsense that Johnny the Homicidal Maniac likes to make fun of. Do yourself a favor - if you want to read something wildy entertaining, stick with Johnny. If you want to kill some brain cells..., try out Lenore."
4,Ewwww Cute!,"A lot of gothic humour comics have been flooding the market recently, but Lenore is one of the best. Lenore is basically about a dead little girl who neither ages nor matures and is filled with oodles of innocent curiousity about the world around her. This often leads her to do gross things (she has had a long line of dead pet cats), and she is very amoral in her childlike innocence, but she is so damn cute you just can't help but forgive her for the sick things she does. Seeing her throw a tea party and invite all the nearby walking-dead or doing a happy little dance at a funeral will leave your mind conflicted over whether you should retch or sigh. And unlike most recent goth comics, this one doesn't take itself at all seriously. Not great art or literature (Gorey and Sala still reign supreme at dark humour comics), but a fun little diversion."
5,Lenore is a gothic wonderland...,"Ah, yes, the ever so elusive mayfly known as a gothic paradise. The Lenore comics, in my opinion, rank right on up there with The Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, and Invader Zim for capturing the heart and soul of the darkness within. Cheery yet suitibly morbid, these grusome tales were passed about my high school like pop corn at a b-grade horror film.Addictive, humorous, and fun to share with an equally apathic friend.I would recomend this book to anyone between the ages of 14 and 21 who has ever felt like the whole world was in stark contrast with reality.If you've ever laughed at a cheerleader that fell on her face, this book is for you.If you *are* a cheerleader and you've *never* fallen on your face, you're too perfect to exist in this realm, let alone to read this book."
2,"Yes, it's a dog.","Tiresome little snippets about a ""dead"" girl who is somehow still alive. Seldom funny or even imaginative, beyond the initial concept, though still better than JTHM (Johnny the Homicidal Maniac), which is why I give it 2 stars. Too bad. Will appeal only to those immature enough to think that comics about a dead girl just HAVE to be REALLY GREAT!"
4,New everything,"Weiss Kreuz Gluhen, comes with new caracter designs and few more surprises. The plot is much more suspenseful than the previous series. We still have Aya, Yohji, Ken and Omi, with the difference that Omi is playing a different role. Yohji & Ken will not appear in the first episode, but we'll see Aya (as usual) and a couple of new hunters. They are OK, but still they remind a little of Omi and Ken.For the people who once read Orwell, there are some features in the plot that reminds ""1984"", specially when we have the existence of a sistem that monitors you all the time.I liked it, the drawings are better than in the first series, although is kind of shocking the new designs os the characters, you'll appreciate that difference."
4,"Gluhen means Glow, Not ""Eternity File""","Lol. sry ;)Well, what can I say? Gluhen rocks. The animation is sharper and way better.The plot line is cooler, too.I mean, Schuldig and the rest of Schwartz are back, too! Well, it does bother me that Yoji kind of looks like Spike from Cowboy Bebop....or at least Andy from the Teddy Bear Bomber Episode! Lol. :)Okay... Watch Gluhen. Episode 6 is when it really picks up!Ja ne!~Honoo Moeru"
5,Great Support,I bought these to help with my small wrists when doing push ups and they are great help. They wrap around several times giving enough support.
5,mesmerizing middle eastern sounds,"I bought this CD a few weeks ago and have listened to its breathtaking dream-like Israeli/Arabic sounds of peace at least 20-30 times already. I am not of eastern heritage, a musician, nor versed in eastern music, and am enjoying this CD tremendously. It is somehow modern and ancient simultaneously, almost a brief anthology of eastern sounds. The instrumentation is delicate and powerful. If you're new to middle eastern music like I am, you'll hear familiar sounds, but not songs. Also if you like Indian music, I think you will appreciate this album as it seems to have an Indian flavor as well. Somehow Dalal and the Al Ol Ensemble have managed to give the music both an exotic, timeless quality while at the same time making it approachable to the foreign western ear. I don't know how they've done it, but I am now looking for more."
1,"Nice Music, Bad quality recording","Hi I liked the artists music, but the problem is with the recording quality. Except for the first track the remaining track were unclear.Thanks"
2,You've got to be kidding me. . . . .,"Two FREAKIN' episodes on the whole disc?!!! For a little more than double the price Warner Bros. could have done a Season 1 package and sold a whole lot more. Two episodes!!!! On 1 disc?!!! My God, even BTAS had 4 on one disc. When these don't sell I'll buy them for a dollar off the discount rack at a retail store. Maybe."
1,Disappointing duplication of 3 episodes,"Why Warner Bros. chose to link SPELLBOUND with SCHOOL DAYZ is a mystery, since all 3 episodes of SCHOOL DAYZ are on the BATMAN BEYOND MOVIE DVD. It would have made more sense to have linked SPELLBOUND with CRUSH, since that VHS volume has still yet to make its DVD debut, now that DISAPPEARING INQUE and TECH WARS have been paired up for DVD. Since most people who buy this will have probably purchased the BATMAN BEYOND MOVIE, they already own half of this DVD. While it's nice to get 6 episodes on the DVD (unlike the usual 3 or 4 of JLA or animated BATMAN), there are no extras. The only explanation as to why we are getting SCHOOL DAYZ on DVD yet again instead of CRUSH seems to be that Warner Bros. are unfamiliar with their own product."
3,"Great series, disappointed on the DVD","I was excited when I saw that this DVD was going to be released. Just got my copy.I thought that all should know that there are 6 episodes onthe disc. Great! Here is the reason for the three stars.3 of the episodes were previously released on the Batman Beyond the Movie DVD as follows:GolemDeadmans HandThe Winning Edge.I do recommend the disc to anyone, but wanted to forwarn allconsumers that if they already have the movie, you are reallyonly getting 3 more episodes."
4,6 episodes - a good deal for the price,"For the sake of clarification, the two ""titles"" on this DVD (School Daze and Spellbound) were previously released separately on video, and are combined together on one DVD. Each video contained 3 episodes of the original Batman Beyond show. As such, this DVD contains 6 episodes : SPELLBOUND / HOOKED UP / A TOUCH OF CURARE / GOLEM / THE WINNING EDGE / DEAD MAN'S HAND.I think this DVD is aimed at two audiences - as a low priced DVD for the kids, as well as for adults who enjoyed the show. I personally would prefer a box set containing every episode, but how many parents would buy that for their kids? Putting the episodes out this way gets both audiences to buy the DVD.This disc contains no extras, but there is a ""play all"" feature.Picture looks great, but no subtitles, and only one audio choice. Still, I give it 4 stars as I feel 6 episodes for the low price is fair."
5,Parent of a hearing impaired child,This is a must for any hearing impaired child under the age of 7. My daughter brings it to school and daycare and her teachers and providers use it as teaching tool to show the other children what being hearing impaired is all about.
5,charms - San diego,As with the other six charms - perfect and securely wrapped on arrival in NZ. Will be purchasing more charms.
3,It's kinda ok...but,"Well...After Abba Army of lovers came to my life and after Army came Vacuum and in late 1999 Alcazar.This new single Don't you want me is ok song.Not best but ok.First of all. Humanleague does it much better.It almost kills me to say this but this is kinda odd single.When song starts you expect it to be so much better but in chorus it goes down...and thats not good.Remixes of this makes it worth of buying.Almighty, Project eden and Johan S does great work and yes Almighty's club mix is my favourite.It has great sounds.But if there would be only radio version i would lefted it right where i saw it!."
3,Abolish Electoral College? Then what?,"How would we of the 21st Century elect our Pres and VP without the electoral college? Edwards has no answer for that, but all the details are clearly laid out in The New Election Game.New Election Game: A Replacement for the Two-Party System of Electing Presidents"
3,Mixed feelings,"This set has some real gems, like the acoustic versions of Che Che Cole, and Chan Chan, it also has a very broad coverage of range, from boleros to trova to son to some recordings of bata music, etc. and also carnival, but that in itself might turn you off if you are looking for more of ""Buena Vista"". Overall a good item in my collection, but honestly there are some CD's I don't even listen to and some pieces are pure garbage, specifically a rendition of ""Son de la Loma"" made in some sort of rap. Asqueroso. The cool thing about this set also, is that if you relax in your couch with a mojito you can imagine yourself walking in La Habana, it is literally a street recording (or maybe some good studion effects) that include some background noise, doors opening as you enter the billiards room, etc."
3,Other episodes in this series are better.,"I thought this was kind of boring at the beginning. The art theme just didn't grab me. I think it got more interesting towards the end, but it was a while ago that I watched this (borrowed it from the library). Well, I guess there's probably a boring episode or two in every series; we can't love all of them. I own the complete second season of Campion and I enjoyed those episodes more."
5,i,this is a really good movie better than fast and furious. initial d and wangan midnight are the bestInitial D [Blu-ray]Initial D The Movie (DVD)
1,Worst movie I've ever watched....,This movie is just aweful....It's like they took a bunch of distorted clips of the original story and pasted them together.It barely creates a story line and doesn't have near enough filler to explain whats really going on.Watch the anime. It's much better.
4,Rules are boring,All's well except the rules are not the old rules. I had to get the rules off the internet to make it a good game.
5,Great for hours of family fun!,"I have played this game since I was a little girl. I finally decided to get one for my own family. It is a simple game but tons of fun. The felt piece is plenty big and easy to store. There is plenty of room for the chips, you just have to be neat with them so they don't get mixed in with the other slots. The cards are flimsy and the chips are kinda cheesy. Also there aren't enough chips to play very long. We ended up buying a separate chip set and using our own cards. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a simple yet super fun family game."
5,Hours of Fun for the whole family,"I grew up playing Rummy Royal with my family. Now I want to continue to play with my new family.I was unable to find any company currently making Rummy Royal games, but Tripoley is almost the same.Only difference on the game board is on the three in a row of any suit. Rummy Royal is 6-7-8, Tripoley is 8-9-10. Otherwise the game board is the same.The Felt mat that comes with this set is very nice quality and seems like it will give us many years of fun.I'm buying one for every house hold in our family, so we can always have one handy to play."
3,"Got the game, but not what was advertised.","The photos attached to the product sale was for a Tripoley game, but where the board spins (lazy susan version). We received the mat version instead. Very disappointing that it wasn't the product indicated and wonder how many others had the same problem. It was new in box sealed and although I wanted the product advertised, it was not worth shipping back. I would still like the lazy susan version. It was still fun to play."
4,Great fun!,"I got this game for my husband for Christmas since we played it at Thanksgiving at my sister's for the first time. We stayed up late, playing for hours. When I took it to the Christmas gathering, after teaching everyone to play, the game itself was in use almost constantly. When I was leaving, my Mother in Law said, ""leave the game here"". They played into the wee hours of the morning. It really is fun, and though it seems complicated the first time you play, after one or two rounds you'll see that it's very simple. My only suggestion is that you get some extra chips. We found that we needed alot more chips than the game includes. Also I think we will eventually need to replace the deck of cards just from use, but it's a standard deck so that's no problem."
5,Tripoley - great way to spend an evening!,"Many years ago (back in the 60's) we played this game with my husband's family, getting together once a month for a potluck meal and playing until the wee hours. Now my grown kids and grand kids wanted to try TRIPOLEY, so I purchased it. Now, every week on ""family night"" we gather for a meal and games and this is one of the most popular. Glad it was still available!"
5,"We are enjoying the game, however ...","The picture of the game did not match the style of the game sent. We thought, from the picture, the game would have a plastic tray with molded cups for chips or coins. It was was a flat felt game ""board."" However, we put small plastic drink cups on the felt and it works just fine - maybe even better than the molded cups because it is easier to remove the chips/coins from the table."
5,3 games in one!,"Three games in one. Tripoley has been around for a long time. It is entertaining for a group up to nine and as few as four. We played with our grandchildren. They learned to play rummy, hearts, and poker all in one sitting! The felt board is light weight so you can carry it wherever you want to. Cards and die are included as well. This game can be as simple and as complicated as you want to make it!"
4,passing down a memory,"This is a game that I learned as a kid. I remember sitting around with Friends and Family We called it Michigan rummy but the mat said tripoley. Great Fun, Great practice in memory and statgey. There is luck involved but also planning. My 12 year old son took to it quickly and soon became a shark. Blast to play, easy to learn,***only down part the game was supposed to have 100 chips, straight from the box only had 99, and if you play with more than 2-3 people there really are not enough chips to play multiple rounds.***** we added some chips of our own"
4,Love this game,"This is a fun game and we enjoy playing it. The box we received was not the one pictured, but that is fine."
4,The description in this ad is wrong,"The description in this ad under ""Features"" is wrong. The Deluxe Mat Version of Tripoley does NOT have a 36x36 inch mat. Also, the other side of the mat has only Texas Hold 'Em and NOT Blackjack. They should fix this. The version with a 36x36 inch mat is the Tripoley plus Black Jack & Texas Hold 'EM version."
5,Excellent game for all the family,"This game is for all ages and the entire family. An excellent way of having fun with parents, kids, grandparents and friends. I used to have a plastic mat, but with this new fabric mat it will be in better conditions for more time long. It would be better if it could contain more chips. I think 100 is not enough."
3,communion gift set,"I had purchased this as a gift, so I did not see this. The receiver was pleased with it."
5,Great Disney Book,"In the original version of the book (the one I have), there was a very well done ""Song of the South"" story, which had ""The Laughing Place,"" and ""The Wonderful Tar Baby,"" both told in dialect. Of course, Disney wouldn't want this little secret to get out, would they? Ha ha. Anyway, the book has pictures straight from the movies. There are classic stories like ""Peter Pan,"" ""The Jungle Book,"" and lots more. Buy this, and hope you get the ""Song of the South"" version."
4,Walt Disney's Treasury of Children's Classics,"The book was supposed to be ""brand new"" and for the most part looks new but inside the cover is writing from a person that was giving the book to someone."
5,EDGAR,I read all of Christy's books. This one is a very good book. It's a great story about two boys (Wilson and Matt) who don't have anything to do for the summer but house work. They meet up with an old hobo that wanders through the area. They get told to stay away but Wilson wants to know who the guy is. This is not just another mystery - it is an adventure. I wish I could have an adventure like this one. VERY GOOD BOOK!
1,disappointed,I was disappointed in the way they remastered this cd it did not sound like the group heat wave the way they sounded on the original songs they recorded. I give this cd one star........
3,Boogie Nights...,"An 'okay' collection from Heatwave. Don't misunderstand me, at one time, they were my favorite group, they could do no wrong in my eyes. It just that this is just another re-hash, and frankly, there's nothing new on this, other than ""Razzle Dazzle."" This just begs the question, ""Where are the albums 'Hot Property' and 'Candles'?"" What are they waiting for? Oh well, I guess I can dream 'til then!! Five stars for Heatwave, three stars for this collection!!"
3,"For the families, not my brothers!","This book is good if a parent, sister or girlfriend is fighting with finding the moral strength to go on when we are away. I am a Marine and about ready to return to the box. I will say only the following, John anf Frank are taking fellow parents on a tour..yet filling their pockets. For Marines...or those Marines that you love and yurn for, get them a book they can love...I would suggest either ""Marine"" the life and story of Chesty Puller or ""Stand By to Fall Out"" the life of a first tour grunt Marine.. That is what we look for, not soap operas. Semper Fi and to those I love, see ya on the flip side!!!"
5,"Satire, parody and some experimental stuff","This album of mostly humorous, melodic and powerful rock songs was recorded during the height of the disco era. It doesn't only satirize the disco culture as in Dancin' Fool, but also deals with other, more controversial subjects in a politically very incorrect way, always with amusing results. Bobby Brown is one of those hilarious but controversial numbers . I love Zappa's unconventional sense of humor! The music is very accessible, although there are a couple of more experimental pieces too. Recommended for those who love intelligent rock music and are sufficiently open-minded. It's right up there with his classics likeWeasels Ripped My Flesh,Joe's Garage: Acts I, II & IIIandYou Are What You Is."
5,Very enjoyable,"A very quick read and I read this book as fast as I could. It was hard to put down, as it was very enjoyable. There are quotes that I will use over and over again in my life, writing, and public speaking. You'll find yourself saying, Wow!, this is his best quote, only to be surprised again on the next page.It showed the good and bad of Einstein (this was not a happily married man), and readers will probably get a better sense of the man than reading some sappy one-sided lovefest biography."
4,"Lots of quotes, maybe too many","There are all kinds of quotes from Einstein to all sorts of people in all sorts of situations including many that are meaningless to anyone other than the person that he spoke or wrote to. For example, here is a quote to the Lebach family: ""Here in Pasadena it is like paradise....Always sunshine and fresh air, gardens with palm and pepper trees, and friendly people who smile at one and ask for autographs."" Here is another quote, this one to Ernesta Marangoni ""The happy months of my sojourn in Italy are my most beautiful memories.""There are many pearls in this book to be sure, but I feel that just because Einstein said it, it is not necessarily noteworthy."
1,DUDER NOT TO SAY A BUMMER !,"IT ONLY HAD 20 TRACKS OUT OF THIRTY TRACKS ON THE CD, PLUS I THINK IT WAS ANOTHER GROUP SINGING ! GET IT AT ATHE STORE INSTEAD ! OR ASK FOR A REFUND IF YOU HAPPEN TO GET A BUMMER CD ! AS I DID !"
5,You Can't Bring 80 People to the Show.,"Optimus Rhyme's first full length album is a fantastic listen. While not as spectacular as their sophmore effort School the Indie Rockers, it is still a collection any fan of nerdcore or hip-hop in general should give a listen to. Wheelie is on point track after track and this album more than anything reminds you how much we all want more tracks from Broken English. My only gripes with the album steam from personal preferences, as I'm not a fan of intros, outros, and interludes. I also seemed to have a problem with the track listings as the intro and outro weren't on the offical track listing. There are also points in the album where the vocals or distorted to a point where I can't understand them. And as a fan of a rapper who is hard to understand in the first place, it really bummed me out. But those issues are small when you consider that the project as a whole is simply amazing."
1,This was Gene Stratton Porter trying to make money.,This was Ms. Porters worst book. It is full of simpy ideas. A five year old girl falls in love and the rest of her life becomes is this love.
5,soxgirl@hotmail.com if anyone can get me a copy ....,"When I was in the seventh grade I was a total book worm. I went through my little town library looking for just about anything to read. I came upon this old harcover book from the 1920's. I read it once and immediately fell in love. Not only is this my favorite book but the only book i've read more than 30 times. Just today I went into my town library with my little sister. I read this book to her for a month every night before she went to bed (I'm sure she'll be a fan of this boook quite soon, also). I wanted to take my favorite book out once again. Much to my dismay the book was gone. I searched every shelf and the computer system looking for this book. The librarians beleive that someone may have taken it. What i would do for my own copy of this book is immeasurable. If only a love like shown in this book were given to every girl this world would be a better place. If anyone know how or where I can get a copy of this book please let me know."
5,Nothing beats Coffee-Mate regular powder!,"I'm so happy Amazon got this in again, finally! Coming in a 12 pack sold by Amazon itself, eligible for free super saver shipping, and shipped in a firmly packaged plastic wrap covering all 12 canisters, it just makes it so convenient to have it shipped to me in bulk and I know I have plenty on hand for a while. I've been a fan of the regular Coffee-mate powder since the early 1970's and nothing seems to be able to compete with it. Even though I've tried the other flavors and the liquids Nestle also makes, and likewise tried other brands, I always come back to this Original Regular Coffee-Mate Powder and believe it will always be my preference for a really rich and flavorful addition to my coffee. Very smooth and blends well, and is shelf stable, which means less trips to the grocery store for me. One of my favorite products that makes for a happy life!"
1,Hydrogenated oils are poison,"Any product with hydrogenated vegetable oils isn't worth buying. The fact that they are pretending not do have any by using a low serving size and rounding down to get to ""0"" grams, makes this a scam. Shame on you Nestle.Hydrogenated oils have been banned in NY for a reason - they are poison for the human body. See the Wikipedia article on trans fats for more information. Here is a clip : ""Because of these facts and concerns, the NAS has concluded there is no safe level of trans fat consumption. There is no adequate level, recommended daily amount or tolerable upper limit for trans fats. This is because any incremental increase in trans fat intake increases the risk of coronary heart disease.[2] """
5,Simple and delicious,"it is simple complement for the morning, noon and evening coffee. It is simpley creamy and delicious. For the people like me that are lactose intollerant it is perfect"
2,"If not for ""Louie, Louie""....","....I'm not sure why anyone would want to listen to this. I guess I had too high of expectations for this, I thought I would be getting a tight, garage-rock band. Instead I felt I got jokey novelty songs and very bland, vanilla covers of classic songs (like ""Shout""). Overall, this was a disappointment to me."
4,blast from the past,This has all the big songs and a few I had forgotten about. It is a good selection with few duds. It has a good range from the classic Louie Louie to their more humorous songs like Long Tall Texan. I recommend it for a trip down memory lane.
4,If you like the Kingsmen...,"This is a good, not great, compilation. The one song it lacks that would fill that void between good & great is ""David's Mood""."
2,best of or worst of?,"Bet of the Kingsmen? The only problem is, how can you distinguish it from the WORST of the Kingsmen? Let's face it: they were godawful. A lotta throwaway knock-offs on the twelve-bar blues form, which a lot of groups of that era did. When I say they were awful, I say it with a certain fond affection. They were the quintessential frat party kegger band, and if you're my age it'll certainly take you back. Ah, yes, Louie, Louie, a veritable masterpiece of pre-flower-power dreck. Wonderful! I'd suggest just downloading the MP3 of Louie Louie instead of buying this double CD. After a few repetitive tracks, the camp value starts to fade. A little bit of it is fun, but it rather quickly starts to get on one's nerves. I can't in good conscience give this more than two stars, and one of those is just for 'Louie, Louie."" Hey, if nothing else it'll give you a fresh appreciation of what the Beatles brought to the rock scene."
3,Inherent Design Flaw,"You'll notice most hummingbird feeders have shallow or no reservoirs... just a drip. Not sure how hummingbirds are supposed to get their little beaks to get to the sugarwater. I know mine has stayed full-- and the hummingbirds stayed away. I may be wrong, but I don't think this one works."
4,Nice Feeder,This was a gift for someone. I like that it is made from recycled glass. I also appreciated the packaging that provided the ingredients (proportions) for hummingbird food.
5,Gentle Music,Out of all 9 Lifescapes CD that I own this one get's played the most. From the beginning track to the last this CD is gentle and very lulling. Pulls you in with just enough instruments to relax you but not be over bearing if you have it playing in the background. I have had this CD since 2005 and still find it often in my car as well as my home.Respectfully Reviewed
5,"Sour, sweet & spicy innovations","There are so many curry cookbooks already on the market today - most from India - that one might wonder at the need for yet another primer on the subject, but COOKING CURRIES offers a different focus which shows curry can be more than a hot or spicy dish, providing recipes for sweet and sour dishes alike, creating variations on traditional curry flavors, and adding new ingredients to encourage cooks to experiment. Author Lawson has over twenty years experience as a professional chef: COOKING CURRIES reflects this background well, adding historical and cultural notes to the recipes and discussing how different international influences have altered curry dishes."
2,Runny,"This cartridge is ok as long as nothing you print with it ever comes into contact with water or moisture. I have a 385 Photo printer and even after the photos are long dried, the slightest moisture or water ruins the picture instantly. Not good HP. Time to re-engineer this cartridge with smudge/water-proof ink like others have done."
1,HP 78 INKJET Cartridges (C6578DN),"I ordered two of these cartridges. They came in old worn beat up boxes (with the correct HP designation, however).Neither one worked. At first I thought they were re-manufactured or bootleg, but now I suspect they were just used cartridges that they put closures on and tried to pass off as new. I'll never again order these from Amazon and it makes me question if it's worth doing business with Amazon ar all.The order was fulfilled by Quantum Electronics. Stay away from them !"
1,surprising customer service,I ordered an inkjet and never received it and got in contact with customer service and they basically called me a liar and accused me of trying to get a refund and keeping the inkjet which I never received. They wrote me an e-mail and said they were refunding my money and to enjoy the free inkjet and please don't ever shop with them again. I thought that was rude and very poor judgment on their part. I e-mailed them back after the nasty e-mail and told them I was very sorry about what happened and if I do receive the inkjet by chance that I would surely get in contact with them to remit the money for it. I never heard from them again.It surely could have gotten lost in the mail. I never received it and they did not want to hear me out about the problem..
1,HP Tri Color inkjet cartridge,"I received the HP inkjet cartridge in good shape, installed the color cartridge in my printer to find out it did not work, so I checked the date on the packaging and it turns out the date for this prodict had expired 2 1/2 years ago, the ink drying up. I was not very happy and sent a letter to the vendor letting them know I was not happy they are selling out of date products and should return my money."
1,cartridge,"Do not buy remanufacture cartridge. For the best quality, it is best to buy brand name in a box. I had many issues with remanufacture cartridges. I am buying brand name only."
5,Hard to find print cartridge,"The print cartridge is exactly as expected. Since it is difficult to find, I will definitely use this service again."
5,Spellbound!,"This is the second time I've read Devin's book, Witch Hunt. The story kept me captivated, again. Going back to past centuries vividly portrayed a recurrent theme of persecution of that which is not understood and those groups that profess superiority. Which is the greater evil or good??? Reminded me of what occurs in today's world. I love Devin's work and have read all of her novels. Can't wait for RED HOT LIBERTY to be released!"
5,Magick goes mainstream,"Poke Runyon is the modern master and authority on the art of spirit evocation and for the first time in a professionally done taping, we get to see an actual working from opening to close.For anyone interested in seeing what really goes on in the ""secret"" world of the ceremonial magician, this is a rare opportunity to find out how ""normal"" it really is. Not the scary, evil stuff that you might have been led to believe.All in all this is a bold step on Poke's part, to just let a camera crew film an actual working without special effects or editing and just let the viewer decide for themself what to make of it. So, if you have ever had a desire to see the inside of a Magick temple or learn more about what Magick is all about, then this tape is a great place to start.For those of you out there that are already conversant with these things, then seeing a Master in action is also well worth the price of admission!!"
1,Mouse excellent; keyboard unacceptable,The mouse is excellent. It works well and has a quality feel to it. It's scaled for child-sized hands - the scroll wheel is too far back to roll comfortably with adult fingers. It puts out a lot of light and stays lit even when my computer is on standby. I gave this combination a rating of 1 because of the keyboard. The keys seem to snag on one another and I can't type a single paragraph without several failed keystrokes. It has a cheesy feel and is of poorer quality than any cheap keyboard I've used. The mouse is available separately at this site and others.
3,Trainspotters guide to Bach,"Eric Lewin Altschuler loves lists. At the back of this book, and referred to throughout the text, are lists of his top ten preludes and fugues, and even his top ten subjects and episodes. This self-confessed ""disk jockey for Bach"" can't help trivializing the music with his tone of forced jocularity and ""delightfully irreverent"" analogies to such subjects as football games, sex and horror movies. It's not all bad, however. The essays could provide an entry point for those nervous of getting to know this wonderful music alone. The basic analysis is good, and the summaries of form are an easy way of following what's going on in the fugues. Grown up alternatives? Donald Tovey's short analysis pieces are still the best. Cecil Gray's book on the 48, although grumpy and quirky like the author, is interesting. Both are hard to get hold of, though. Altschuler's book can be found in second hand stores - just look out for the gaudy cover."
5,music and poetry in the language,"It's been years since I read this, but it is time to read it again.The scene comparing the logger trapped under a log in the river with the sandpiper snatching food and then fleeing from the encroaching waves is so poetic that it reminds me of the best of Walt Whitman's work."
5,Aboslutely the best novel I've ever read,"Don't listen to everybody who says that it is too confusing to follow or that it randomly jumps from one pointless, rambling narration to the next-they just don't understand the book. It's absolutely incredible in its capturing of Oregon, of characters, of feelings...read it!"
2,overly epic,"I loved Cuckoos nest. It was wonderfully structured, crisp, and had such a strong narrative. This book was long and wandering. The changing point of view detracted from the books impact. I was dissapointed. I was looking for another cleanly written book. I did enjoy the grand scope of the novel. It covered multiply generations. I also enjoyed the way Kessey depicted the Oregon logging town."
2,Not poolside reading.,"This is a very difficult book to follow. Be prepared to read the same page a couple of times to understand which character is talking. One of those literary achievements that is written as a ""stream of consciousness"", with few chapter breaks. I think few would care to admit that they gave up on the book after 100 pages and went on to a Leon Uris novel. I am sorry if I insult all those literary snobs out there with 720s on their verbal SATs, but this is not that good a book.Still, One Flew... is still a classic and one of my all time favorites."
1,a mess.,I gave up after 2 chapters;just couldn't follow the scenes in the book.This book was recommended to me as a way to understandsomeone I had been having trouble working with.Maybe I'd understand the videotape better.
1,Can I give anything lower than 1 one star?!?!?!,"The book was horrible!! I had to read it for an english class. It was dull. I could sleep but after read it, I felt asleep with no problem. Near the ending part of the book, he spent three pages describing how the coming of the canadian honker symbolize the coming of winter and how the town differed from other towns. The ending was also very confusing. I still don't get what Lee and Hank realize as the ""secret of life."" Why does Indian Jenny throw sand and shells on her pillow case? Why did she take off her clothes in the last sentense? The jump between time frames made the book very confusing. Half of the time, I am not sure who is thinking what and who was talking what. During one part of the book, each sentence was about a different person, doing different things, in different locations. Very confusing."
3,It's a good story...,"Saw the movie in 1977, and it really ""got to me"". A few years back, I read the book. A good read, and Kesey's description of the bar fight, and when the prodigal son returns are riveting.Usually, the book is better than the movie, but in this case, I would say that the movie gives the book a good run for its money. I mean, the last scene can only be truly appreciated by seeing the movie, and the part where Joby dies is also more vivid from the movie. And seeing burned logging equipment is so much more vivid than reading about it.If you like Kesey, you should read it. If you liked the movie, you should read it. If you like the genre of larger-than-life heros who come to tragic ends, read it. If you like novels that have lots of chainsaws in them, read it :-)"
2,Only a few lucid sections,"This book had so much potential, but clearly needed a good editor to organize the author's scrambled thoughts. The reader has to work really hard to keep up with who's narrating, with the focus sometimes changing mid-paragraph, or even mid-sentence. The lucid sections were vivid and fabulous, but sadly were few and far between. I want to read a good story, without having to decipher the product of a spoiled author and a lazy editor."
2,the film was better than the book.,"I agree with the most critical review. I always finish a book that has been recommended as good literature. For starters, the film is to be recommended because it takes less than a few hours to watch. This book needs some editing. The novel reminds me of art that some artist has poured paint cans on a canvas, and askes the ""work"" to be reviewed by some of us who have the effrontery to say ""it looks like someone dumped cans of paint on a canvas"".The narrative seemed to lack connectively. Where was the plot? Who were the characters? I read ""One flew over a Cukoo Nest"". I didn't think it was better than Treasure Island, but it was readable, understandable, and I felt it had a few more words than necesary. I get the impression, that some writers are like some people, they like to hear the sound of their keys."
2,Too difficult to get into,"This book was recommended to me after I had traveled the Oregon coast, and I was anxious to read the book which so many have termed ""the great American novel."" However, I could just not get into the story. Following the point of view is a challenge, to say the least. I couldn't keep track of who was thinking, talking or where we were in the time frame of the story. I am not a reader who likes fluffy kinds of stories, but this one was too much. So disorganized and barely lucid. I also found that after 100 pages, there wasn't one character in the book that I liked, or cared about--that is, if I could figure out who was who. I gave up at page 100. Maybe the idea for the story was a great notion, but I couldn't follow it. I am amazed at all of the people who found this book so great--being that is it so extremely difficult to read."
5,Easily One of the Top Five Books I've Ever Read,"I first read this book in 1977, stationed in Bermuda in the US Navy. My roommate, from California, had brought his tattered copy with him. I acknowledge that the first section is sort of a challenge and I can see how it would lose some readers. I strongly urge anyone who has stopped reading it to go back and try again. There are probably a lot of people who have given up. However, being informed of the challenge of the first section should make it easier to hang in there. I picked it up again in 2000, and it was easily as enjoyable a read as the first time. Anyone who reads has an incomplete ""MUST READ"" list if they haven't read this book!"
4,The book IS the river,"Kesey has crafted a sublime story in such a way as to have the narrative of the book (what some readers think of as confusing) actually mimic the Wakonda Auga. There are countless tributaires, sloughs, pools, rapids, switchbacks and oxbows of text, all building to a river of the story, leading inevitably to the conlucsion. Yeah, the plot can get complicated and the narrative convoluted, but it's worth it. If you want a simple, linear plot read Stephen King. But dismissing this book as poorly written or too confusing only highlights your ignorance."
5,The Great American Novel Revealed,"All your pundantry, your eastcoastcentricty......No its not Tender is the Night....its not The Great Gatsby, its not Look Homeward Angel, its not...Tropic of Capricorn, or On The Road....its not Grapes of Wrath, V., Catcher in the Rye, Under the Volcano....its not Moby Dick, its not Leaving Cheyanne....all great contenders...Its the Great American novel.....Take this one in....marvel in its depth...its bold dream scape of reality across this land to the great Northwest........ come on, you all better look back....this IS the Great American Novel...."
5,"Difficult at first, but well worth the effort","I have a daughter in college and to encourage her readinghabits we read a novel at the same time, switching off asto who picks the book. I choose this one and she absolutelyhated it for the first 100 or so pages until she fell underits trance, much like I did. To those of you who think thatKesey was a one book wonder, please take the time to readthis book. You will not regret it."
3,"God book, a little scattered and difficult to follow.",I bought this book after finishing One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest.This one is well written but the plot and characters move around so often it makes it hard to follow.I'm still reading it but it's getting more and more frustrating as I go on.
3,a total downer,some one recommended this book over several of my favorites - So I was excited to crack it. It has a nice modern dense prose but... its a total downer. The tone is very grounded but its quicksand - soon youre suffocating. I typically pride myself in finishing books but this one repulsed me - I dont need to go on a negative trip like that.
4,Overlooked work is a struggle about struggle,"First of all: I agree with a lot of the reviewers who appreciate this book, and feel that it has been overlooked. Yes, it's not a pure masterpiece like _'Cuckoo's Nest_, but it is a fine novel. I liked the characters and the themes, and the viceral scenery too. But the books drags, man, it drags. The reader ends up like the Stamper family, pushing forward through the long pages until one can go no further."
3,Worth Reading,"I read SOMETIMES A GREAT NOTION as part of an assignment over the Summer. It was a very difficult read and I gave up half way through. I didn't touch it for a month and resigned myself to the fact that I wouldn't show up at school the first day having completed the assignment. The first weekend of the school year I sat down and read the last 250+ pages and I'm so glad I did. If nothing e,se NOTION is an experience worth having. It may not always be enjoyable but I feel that it's certainly worth while."
5,The Great American Novel,"The Great American Novel was written over 30 years ago, and it's name is ""Sometimes a Great Notion.""One of those books that changes lives. I first read it at age 17, re-read it countless times during my 20s, and recently read it again at age 47.It's frightening, and often disheartening, to go back to favorites as you grow older. Books that seemed dazzling to the teenage perspective seldom retain their charm to the older reader. Happily, I found Sometimes ... just as remarkable, just as thought-provoking, just as entertaining as I did 30 years ago.The descriptions of the Oregon woods, the conflict of brother vs. brother and individualist vs. group are laser bright and beautiful. I envy you if this is the first time you'll read this book. It is Hank's bell."
4,"Real Life ""Adventure""","Not an adventure when compared to fictional safari tales in which the intrepid travellers fight off fierce lions and savage ""natives"" in every chapter. Instead, an enjoyable and realistic account of Greene's arduous and near-disasterous trek through Liberia. Greene travelled with his cousin, Barbara Greene, who also wrote an account of their journey--Too Late to Turn Back. Interesting contrasts between the two books if you can find copies of both. I had to order a copy of Barbara's book from a used book store in England."
3,I HAVE BEEN THE PLACES IN THE BOOK,"I work in Liberia running a safari camp and have for the past 15 years. I have been to most of the places in the book I think, many of which have different names today. A lot of the attitudes of the people have not changed from Greene's trip in 1935. For me the book was a great experience and puzzle trying to figure out where he was. There are better roads today (in some places), the people have watches, radios, but not much else has changed. For the visitor to Liberia or someone who has been there, it is a great story and very insightful into the minds of the people."
2,very dissapointed,"I bought this book by the title, expecting a great book that would thrill my grandchildren with ""big, fat cookies""....... what I got was the same old same old. I wouldn't even give this as a gift."
4,Fun Cookbook,I purchased this cookie cookbook just to enjoy the recipes and found that I not only enjoyed reading them but baking many of the selections.
5,"Kindle Edition- Amazing cookies, good format","As others have said, these cookies are delicious. Each recipe I've tried so far has come out perfectly the first time. The table of contents lists each recipe, making the one I want easy to find. This is a must-have if you have cookie lovers in your life."
4,Appeals to my sweet tooth,I haven't gotten to try any recipes yet but have highlighted several to try. Excited to begin baking and adding to my recipe collection.
2,Were these recipes tested???,"Like other reviewers, I thought the organization and look of the book was spot on. But, and it's a big but, the finished product didn't turn out as it looked in the picture. For instance, the butterscotch blondies melted before they could set up, and so were a mess...but they sure tasted good. So now I'm reluctant to try any other recipes."
5,Great for a family,"We use this book every night at dinner with our girls (7 and 10) and it is a nice mix of Bible reading, conversation starters, and praying together. The topic range is great and there is something in it for everyone in the family."
5,Great Min'yo,This is a wonderful complilation of Japanese folk music. It was everything I expected and more. The traslations are wonderful and the commentaries in the booklet very helpful.Look for other venues to buy this CD if you can't find it here for $25-$35. Others sell this CD and ones like it for much more reasonable prices than $50-$125. Mine was from Amazon seller/UK $30. Got it fast/new/good price. I hope that the person who has the rights to this CD will reprint it so that others can buy it at a reasonable price from honest sellers.
2,Just cancelled my subscription,"My bust library of back issues isn't going anywhere, but I just sadly cancelled my subscription. This magazine used to flat out make my day (week?) as I eagerly devoured it. Now it is a flip and toss. Which is fine for those 10 bucks for 12 issues mags. This one, not so much. Plus the decline makes me sad."
2,Torn about Bust,"On one hand, I like this magazine. I appreciate the interviews for the most part (Amy Sedaris), and I love the retro articles with feminist takes, like the one they did on airline stewardesses. They seem pretty jazzed about women in music, so there are reviews every issue. The mag is littered with plenty of dense, blurbish ""reporting"" on varied subjects, keeping the reader interested and moving along. On the other hand...I don't feel like the mag ""applies to"" my age group; though it tries to keep everyone happy, their main demographic is obviously young women in their 20's. And I have read too many incorrect, flip, trying-to-be-oh-so-young-and-hip and just plain not-well-thought-out responses from Betty Dodson, their resident sexpert. Additionally, I think a magazine like this should avoid politics altogether. It's obviously liberal, considering the recent article on Obama's wife.I don't love it, I don't hate it. I'll just read it at the library or newsstand."
2,Crappy Delivery,"Well, I got home yesterday and whipped open my mailbox in anticipation of my new magazine! And what was that when I opened flipped the lid? It's larger than an envelope... roughly magazine size-ish... could it be?? No. It wasn't. It was just a flyer. Still no magazine. I guess I'm going to have to call the dreaded 800 number and just hope that they don't hang up on me as they did octobersky! Now I just need to find the number."
1,I gave up on my subscription.,"I never got a single issue and I live in the USA. I finally started buying them from borders. I don't feel so badly about it now because BUST has gotten too slick for me anyway. I miss the old days of reader submissions. It felt like BUST was actually a magazine made by people like me about people like me. Now it's nothing but an endless parade of skinny, white hipsters, and people in their late 30s trying to cling on to some bizarre Jane magazine notion of young and it's not so fun. I had been loyal to bust for years but not I just read other magazines, which are cheaper. I sse no point in paying nearly five bucks for a magazine, when I can get nearly the identical contents in something like Teen Vogue."
4,good book,This was an older book but I have studied the patterns and it was in great condition.I was very happyjohnel casey
2,"Wouldn't call these quilts, necessarily...","I've been looking for good patterns for doll and cradle quilts and was excited about this book after reading the reviews. Sadly, I was very disappointed. More accurately, the items in this book should be called fabric wall hangings, not quilts. They're all quite intricate, use lots of stencils and wouldn't be appropriate to put on a bed. I don't think there's one pattern that could be completed in a day and they're certainly not for beginners.This book will go on the shelf with a few others that didn't turn out to be what I hoped."
4,Cool case...,This case is pretty neat. can't give it five stars though as you can't plug in the dock connector while using it.
3,An excellent brief political history of the post WWII period,"Chafe does a good job on selected topics;i.e., politics, civil rights and foreign policy. Weak on economics, technology, farm policy. Heavily dependent on some secondary sources like Doris Kearns Goodwin. Needs updating badly. 4th edition has been delayed for months."
3,A neat pamphlet...,"This would be an interesting guide to those who know nothing about lockpicking. It would also be an interesting guide to a lot of people online who think they know something about the subject - many of them don't and confuse terms, etc.As a Beginner's guide, it's probably better than I'm giving it, two stars...if you're really up the food chain on this topic, it's a one star or simply a curiosity.But what grabbed me was the fact that this little pamphlet, and that's what it is, a group of papers you could run on a high dollar Xerox machine and then staple it all together...not a book really...is going for $89.95.[...]"
5,The 60's--When We Could Make Fun of Presidents,"There was somthing about the youthful John Kennedy in office. Could anyone make fun of DDE the way we could of JFK? And the cultural divide was so great with RMN that the jokes were more obvious but then more one-sided. When this album came out, it had more advance sales than anything up to that time. How many people remember that? I bought the vinyl some years ago and will keep this since this will be a valulable collectors' item 50-100 years from now."
3,Decent Player...GREAT PRICE!,"This is a normal CD Player. Nothing great, nothing flashy, but dependable and sturdy. I routinely use this in my car and at school...for my uses, its great. I wouldn't try running with this though. I strongly advise you to buy this . I would rate this 5 stars for cost efficiency."
3,Definite progress!,"Here, Mellencamp gets definitely, measurably better.The songs are more developed, well-rounded...catchier.The production becomes more modern.There are songs that finally hint at the artist that was just over the horizon.""Ain't Even Done With The Night"" is arguably the first Mellencamp song that could be identified as such; a ""Mellencamp"" song. It's obvious he wrote it and he sang it. All his other stuff was too generic. Now he starts to cone down on to what he's all about.""Tonight"" shows his gift with up-tempo rock, and ""Cheap Shot"" gleefully previews his ""little bastard"" persona.And yes, the bonus track is not a throwaway...it's definitely a keeper.This is also the first album that non-fans should pick up if they already have the more popular selections..."
1,RIPOFF!,"Looking at the terrible quality you can tell Left Eye's family did not authorize this. What a disapointment. All the video looks like it was taped off the TV with a VCR. There is no music and no Left Eye or TLC performances. The video looks awful. Only interviews you get are from fans. To top that off, the DVD is only 40 minutes long!! What a ripoff!"
3,Buy it,"I just watched this DVD a few minutes ago, & I would say it worth the buy. Some of the information about Lisa Lopes is inaccurate, but it is still worth buying. Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes was a pretty, talented and misunderstood and she will be missed."
3,Eye-catching and grippy...but...,"I've enjoyed the fun texture and look of this iPod skin and have had it on my iPod since I bought it 5 months back. I love the way it feels, and it helps one grab and hold onto the iPod. However, when I removed the skin for the first time, I was dismayed to find that sand/dirt had managed to get inside the skin and scratch the iPod. Turns out that the dirt is getting in thru the click wheel area. There is no protector or seal for the click wheel with this skin. There is a plastic display protector, thankfully. As I carry this thing in my belt bag every day, it is exposed to some dust/dirt... so it would be a good improvement to include some kind of click wheel protection with this skin."
3,La Tour Eiffel & Camembert!,"I found this to be a bit darker than the average chick lit and disappointingly lacking closure. However, I enjoyed and was entertained by the story - this I know because I am actually truly concerned as to what the future holds for the characters ... it was somewhat unclear at the end of the book. I would read this author again. I was drawn to the book by the Eiffel Tower on the front cover and the mention of camembert on the back cover. :)"
2,Coleman Percolator,Makes great coffee but first pot came with broken glass topper. Second pot arrived with topper intact but it broke after about 2 weeks. Bottom portion of topper breaks easily where it threads into metal top of percolator. Also has a very flimsy aluminum brew basket and stem that looks like it will not last very long.
3,The insert came bent and it's very cheaply made! :(,While the pot itself is very well made the basket/stem/lid is very very cheaply made (eg: think aluminum foil) :( I am at a quandry as to where I can purchase a better insert that will fit this pot. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
4,Going to Pot,"This coffee pot is everything that it was advertised to be. I do have a smooth top stove and flat bottom pans work the best on it. This pot does not have a flat bottom but the center section of the pot does touch the heating surface of the stove, so it does ""perk"" the coffee okay. I like the way it looks, as I am going for the old west look in my home. The first time I made coffee in it I took it to it's limits and filled the coffee basket full and the water compartment full. It did boil over when I did this and got a little messy inside the pot. I now kick it back a little and it works fine. There was a learning curve for me to figure out when the coffee was done but I got it all figured out now and am happy with my purchase."
4,Coleman 14-cup Percolator,This is an excellent percolator for perked coffee on your stove top. The only problem I encountered just this morning is a piece of the clear glass top broke off in the undersurface.
2,Weak Link,"I received my Coleman 14-Cup Coffee Enamelware Percolator and was impressed with the weight of the pot. However when I opened the lid, I was very dissapointed with the quality of the basket and stem. It came in slightly bent and I could understand this happening because of the cheap quality of the metal. The quality of the insert doesn't match the outside of the pot. I know that I will be searching for a replacement made more substantially.Tommy Gee"
1,"Glass ""dome"" on top broke the first time I used it.","Basket was bent upon arrival, basket tube has a kink in it, the aluminum in the basket and top are corroded, glass top cracked during the fist use.Overall poorly done!"
3,Glass top breaks,This is the 3rd Coleman Coffee Percolator we have had within the last 4 years. The glass top breaks and just shatters. Would love to see Coleman improve this.
1,arrived broken,"Ordered this for a Valentine's Day gift, and it arrived with the glass topper broken. Very disappointed, and my sweetie loved it if it didn't have to be returned."
4,Great product,I used this everyday while in the field. The only improvement I would like to see is a way for the lid to secure in place for when not in use.
5,Great Perc ... but cheaper elsewhere,"Makes great coffee! We just ordered a second one from Coleman's on-line website for $24.00. Odd that amazon says the list price is $34.99, eh?"
3,coffee,I was really pleased this product came on time. I was concerned the inner works (coffee holder and the stem inside is not very strong and bends easy. Also after a month of use the glass on the top cracked on the inside. leaving a small area with no glass. I need to see if they have replacement opieces
3,coleman 14 cup percolator,"I like this product and it makes really good coffee. I only gave it a 3 star rating because the insert (basket/stem) is very flimsy and infact was bent when it arrived. I am sure that it will break sometime soon and I have already been looking for a replacement insert so that I have one when this one goes. ALso - I wish the handle of the percolator had some type of coating or insulator so that it would not get too hot. You have to pick up the handle with a pot holder. Otherwise, the percolator makes excellent coffee - much better than an electric percolator or drip coffee maker."
2,poor quality,my wife wanted this coffee pot because it looks old fashioned.when she washed it the glass top broke.the pot was expensive but not worth the money.probably made in china
1,coffee pot,When I recieved the coffee pot it was damaged. I returend it about 3 weeks ago and have not recieved credit yet. I do not know who to contact at Amazon and I think I am screwed!
2,Poor Quality,"This is a real disappointment. Within one week of receiving the percolator, the glass on the top cracked rendering the pot useless. I expected much better quality from Coleman. Would NOT recommend."
3,Nice looking but impractical,"This percolator looks good, and is a nice size, but we felt it would not hold up well on several days of camping and cooking over a camp stove. We sent it back and ordered a different percolator."
2,Pass on this for camping,"If you are buying this for camping, move along. Mine was only used once for coffee then for boiling water and doesn't even make it into the car these days.There were grounds in it (ok I can live with that) and it took FOREVER to boil. Frankly when we camp we have mountain biking/kayaking/hiking to do and can't wait around for this. Doesn't stand up well on a fast gas stove.As other reviewers have stated, the interior basket/stem is really flimsy, and although mine didn't have a chance to, my friend's one melted when the top fell in the campfire (it's not glass as some have said, it's hard plastic).The handle gets crazy hot, and the hinge holding the lid on is not firm either.It's probably great for RVing etc but it doesn't come camping with me anymore, things either work reliably or they get left in the garage. :("
1,Rusted!,"Despite careful care-taking, it rusted around the rim. I wouldn't purchase this item. And for future camping trips, I probably will take a kettle and french press instead."
2,Insides aren't as great as the outside,"I love the Coleman brand, and this ceramic on steel is great - but the ""guts"" of the pot are so flimsy I know it's gonna break really fast."
1,Very Disappointed!,Ordered two coffee pots for mother's day gifts. One arrived with a HUGE chip out of the bottom inside and out. I thought Coleman would be a good brand but I was mistaken. Sent it back. Amazon refunded quickly! Not sure what one to order for camping. I want enamal but not too many bigger size pot choices. But I would not reccomend this coffee pot.
3,"Great Pot, Bad Basket!","The basket stem broke after about two months. from the beginning, we had to use rubber bands to keep the lid on the basket from popping off.Also, the pot gets very hot and hasn't an insulated handle, so you will need a pot holder to pour it.Other than that, it's satisfactory."
2,Not worth the price,"Purchased this and used it about four times then the basket stem broke from the bottom base. I know from the start it was flimsy and cheaply made. What I didn't know, until today, is that if you go to Coleman's online store to order a replacement, they no longer carry the replacement baskets, stem/base in stock. So, I'm stuck with a coffee maker and no way to make coffee (other than cowboy coffee and that is not an option).For the four times used, the coffee was good. Now, I guess it will become a target for my next trip to the back yard range.Time to look for another manufacturer; Coleman has lost my business."
5,Coleman 14 Cup Enamelware Coffee Perculator,"I've already send you a review on this but I will do it again. Tha parcel was perfect packed, but the glass thing on the top was broken again. So I advice that you pack that in bubble wrap or something. I'm not going to send it back again, because I want to see if I can find that ting seperatly. If I may, can you pleas tell me why am I waiting for so long to get my kindle?"
2,Coleman Percolator,I was disappointed with this product being made in China for one. Also the brew basket is extreamly flimsy and easily bent. I expected more from a camping item.
5,Ideal for camping!,Took this with on our last camping trip and we love it! Made excellent coffee every time. Cleans up easily if you rub a bar of soap around the bottom and the bottom edge before you cook over the fire.
4,Inspirational fiction at its best!,"Michael Phillips is a Christian writer. He weaves parables in with a solid storyline every time! This book is really good. It leaves you on the edge of your seat, brings tears to your eyes, and gets you really involved with the characters. The lessions I learn about Christian faith are always well worth the read! Thanks Mr. Phillips, and keep up the great work. This book is not biased because that is what the stories are meant to do, teach Christian faith."
5,Good Peaceful Music,"Good peaceful listening music that brings back to your memory the fantastic stories that you saw years ago. Music brings back the good memories. Good product.David Kunkler, Rushville, Ohio"
3,Harold and the Purple Crayon,My daughter has been watching Harold and the Purple Crayon on HBO and the narrator is a woman. The video is the original 1960's narrator with the color purple fading in and out. I was really hoping for the updated version that she watches on HBO.Great books however disappointing video.
2,Crummy Color and Animation. Boring!,"I love the Harold books, but the translation to DVD did nothing for the story. Part of my issue with this DVD is that the colors and animation seem 'old', like Scholastic just grabbed an old worn out VHS and burned it onto DVD. Also, the charm of the books is imagining how one line-drawing could morph into the next drawing. In the DVD, the drawings seem just as real as Harold and it is not as fun. I was so bored after watching five minutes that I turned it off, and never even showed it to my niece, for whom I bought it. Maybe little kids would like it, but it was definitely not for me. I was disappointed because I like almost all the other Scholastic DVD's I've seen."
1,Incorrect readings after 2 uses.,"I used this thermometer to check mash temperatures for homebrewing, I needed a probe thermometer to reach different parts of a 15 keg. It matched the temperature readings of my other thermometer for 2 days, and then after that constantly read at 190 - even when out in a 70 degree F basement. Resetting the power and other settings did not fix this, and there are no functions to re-calibrate."
1,DO NOT BUY MUI,"Be forewarned This unit works fine at first. It is the probe which is very poor, needs replacement frequently (expensive)"
2,Poor durability,Don't think we used this thermometer much but it failed after only about one year anyhow. Hopefully you can find a better option. We're looking too.
1,Doesn't work,"This thing sucks. Followed the instructions; choose temp setting, insert into meat, then turn on alert. It immediately begins the timer function and starts beeping. When the alert is turned to off, it shows the temperature max setting but never shows the actual temperature of the probe. So you have no idea what the probe temp is whether or not the alert is turned on. Very lame product. The timer is a useless function anyway - what difference does it make if the meat has been over temp for a minute? So what exactly are you supposed to do if the meat has been over temp for 35 seconds versus 55? The Poulder I used to have was very straightforward and you could actually see what the temperature was."
1,Worked twice then flaked out.,"Garbage. If switch to move from F to C is far too touchy (it's fully set to F and keeping flickering back and forth between F and C). I used it maybe twice before it went bad. The last time it worked correctly I used it to cook fish (i.e. the oven was never anywhere near as hot as it's ""safe zone"" of 400o). Now I drop the probe in a glass of icewater and I get a reading of 95o (yes, F not C). No support on their web site, no reset button, no buying these guys products again."
5,Best thermometer going,"We have had the MIU meat thermometer for over five years. We love it. It's very easy to use and extremely accurate with the heat readings. We've never had a problem with it. Just remember that meat keeps on cooking after it comes out of the oven, so depending on how you like the doneness, you may want to take it out five degrees above or below your target."
2,Will It Work This Time?,"This is my second MIU electronic oven thermometer I have bought. The first one worked one time. By the time I used it the second time, it was over a month and I couldn't get an Amazon refund. Maybe this one will work more than one time. The thermometer programming sure could use some additional features than what it has now."
1,doesn't measure temp over 400 degrees,many recipes require temps of 500 degrees...this thermometer only measures to 400 degrees... the directions say it will not work over 400 degrees because it will harm the termometer...i say this is a ripoff...an oven thermo should measure temps that an oven is capable of...so...i DO NOT recommend this termo...
5,A specialist in fairy stories must save the Gryth Chalice from an unknown collector,"Once again, BBC outdoes its self with adapting books to TV. This time it is with a Margery Allingham mystery, Camion. Screenplay by Alan Plater.Peter Davison as Albert Campion and his faithful companion Brian Glover as Magersfontein Lugg are so good in this 1989 TV series that even when you read the book you think of them. The story sticks closely to the book in the beginning; however first time through the program you will notice that it becomes abbreviated and Alan Plater shows thru. By the second viewing, you are hooked.In this installment Campion aka Twelve Trees among other names, recruits Robin Lermitte as Val Gyrth to help protect the Gryth challis from being stolen by an unknown collector. We meet with many mysterious people including polite criminals and a wicked witch.Will the challis be pilfered right-out from under Campion's nose or was it too late from the beginning?Campion - The Complete First Season"
5,A good price !!!!!!!!,Was not to hard to put on. good and study. Made with heavey metal and all your fiting go togather. and looks neat. Thanks MH
4,Sweet Treats,I bought this item back in 2007 for Mother's Day. Sorry to the delayed review. How can you go wrong with Godiva? High quality sweets in a lovely decorative basket with ribbon. A tasty assortment of fine chocolates is always a welcome way to show Mom you care. That along with a hug.
4,With good surprise,I ordered Jacob Holdts book and it arrived very quickly and as a surprise the book was signed by Jacob Holdt. Very cool :-)
4,I like this product!!!,I like this product for the skin purification and clearing benefits. Taking it just one week i noticed more clarity.
2,Not Giving Up Yet...but I Continue to Hope for Better,"I'll admit that I am perhaps a little too attached to Honky Tonk Union, but I have really struggled to embrace the direction that Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers are going. Clyne continues to have strong chops, and the musicianship remains top notch. The song-writing, at least to my ears, has been on a bit of a decline over the last couple of albums. No More Beautiful World has a moment or two that reminds me why I became a fan, but I can't justify listening to an album front to back for a moment or two. It's understandable that bands need to evolve, but until that evolution equals or surpasses their origins, I wish RCPM could do a little more channeling or their early work."
5,Great Stuff,"Don't even think about a Buffett comparison, Roger's a much better lyricist. This is a great album. Just buy it."
2,I Was Not Sold,"I think I was expecting something more from this book. I know he has a large following and has done very well with sales, but I had a hard time placing this guy that high on the mantel. The much better (and unfortunately shorter) version of this theme is Firefox. I usually like a lot of character development, but what we had here was just high school gym chatter. The fighter scenes were not badly written, but it was not enough to save the whole book."
4,My first and favorite IG book,"This is the first IG book that I purchased when I got my first IG (mind is an older edition, I think). I found it extremely useful in getting to know the quirks of IGs (and mine have many) and the photos are beautiful. I would note that this is NOT the breed for everyone. They are hard to housetrain (especially for those of us with irregular schedules) and they have tiny little bones. However, you can't beat them for sweetness.I've not read the ""IG in the 21st Century"" book, but this is the best of any of the ones I have seen on the subject so far. Gave 4 stars only because this is a newer edition than mine and may have some changes."
4,Great history of the breed,"This book has a very detailed history of the breed which I loved. The only reason that I did not give the book 5 stars is because all of the pictures in the book are black and white. If you are considering an IG to show, this book gives some great insight."
4,Italian Greyhounds Today,The book even suits an european enthusiast who already knows how to take care of an IG. Above all it provides wonderful pictures and information on the history of the breed in Britain and elsewhere.
4,Strong entry in the series and a great set up for the next one.,"The family gets out of Rome and the ""press"" of the era is explored. Plus there's pirates. Everybody likes pirates. There is a deus ex machina that saves Falco but otherwise this was an enjoyable mystery."
3,Fine idea but PC is for keyboard and mouse,"I bought this thinking what most of you probably are but if your going to game on PC and you don't want to use a traditional console style game pad or whatever, then invest in a good keyboard and mouse, you'll have to grab the keyboard to type eventually. The pad is too big and the buttons are too hard to press, but for kids I think it would be great to get them into PC gaming or for older people who can't see all that well. This thing reminds me of those huge tv remote control I used to get my grandparents as gag gifts, not really useful but fun."
1,Complete Waste of Money,Complete Waste of Money-The keys are badly positioned and can become very uncomfortable after only a short time.-The keys are unresponsive and unreliable.
5,Great Pad.,Get this it is the best gaming add-on you can get. Had mine for over 1 year now...have had no problems...my game has improved as a result of this pad.
2,Can't Program Keys,"There is no way to program the keys.I bought this based on the advertising that said I could program the keys. They advertise that you can program the keys, but that is not true. The ability to program keys is only available in your game's options menu.There is no inherent way to program the keys on this this key pad. The keys are locked to specific keys on the keyboard.Take heed.Otherwise the game pad works great. The ""s"" key's odd shape sometimes makes backing up difficult though."
2,Shaped right -- buttons are terrible,"PRO: The ergonomics are great. Whoever designed this product did an outstanding job mapping button placement.CONS: The button sensitivity and quality is a mess. I can not stress this enough. I should not get finger fatigue after 10 minutes from preeesssiiing haaaard on the buttons during play.An example: you are pressing ""W"" to walk forward, applying the same pressure the entire time. Sometimes your player stops....starts....then stops again. So frustrating.Other reviewers warmed me of this. I ignored them. Shame on me"
4,"Cool, just not THAT cool.","So, with all the research I did before buying this product, I kept asking myself if this was something I would really use.After buying this product, I have found a few things out:For starters, it does not have any software required to run this, so that is nice. But, it acts like a little keyboard... that's it. No macros, nothing really all that cool about it. Just a nice little keypad to make it a little easier to position your hand, nice little palm rest, etc.When using this for World of Warcraft, it works much like my keyboard. But when I need to type, I'm right back to my real keyboard and then running my character and cycling through my rotation with my full keyboard. I have to remember to go back my new little game pad. Which yeah, it's nice... but not really $30 nice.I got a good deal on the product, it was shipped in a timely manner and it works exactly like it's supposed to. But in all actuality, it's just not really as cool as I thought it would be."
4,Fairly Good,"The cyber snipa game pad is great for fps games and for using as shortcut keys for other applications. The gamepad does not need any software and connects to your computer through a usb port and acts as a second keyboard, so if you push the forward arrow, ""W"" is what you are actually pressing. The only problem that i had with this product was that you have to push the buttons all the way down for them to work. If youre in a hurry and you press the button quickly then most of the times it wont work. But overall it is a good product and i love the lighting to match my gaming computer.Edit:After owning this for four years I can uphold my original review. It is great build quality and all of the buttons still work. The only problem is that the LED lighting began to fade and then disappear completely. This is not a functionality problem but merely cosmetic."
3,"It works like it's supposed to, but not the way I need it to.","I'm an online gamer, but I only have the use of one hand. I thought the gamepad would make things easier for me, but it actually made gaming more difficult. With only 4 function keys (F1-F4) and the strange layout of the non-movement keys it actually makes MY game nights very difficult.Perhaps its because I haven't adjusted to it quite yet, but I don't think I'll be using it much.The limited number of function keys is a serious drawback, however"
4,Gaming pad,"I think its very cool, i bought it for my son. He seems to like it, just has to get to using it more."
4,Great keyboard replacement for gaming,"I'm gonna keep this short...I was looking for a gaming pad for playing games on my laptop. I'm happy to say, I'm very happy with my choice. The buttons have a very nice feel & response. My only gripe, is that there could be a few more buttons."
1,DID NOT WORK! BEWARE!,"Gamepad did not work! Tried on 3 compters with XP and Win 7. No drivers needed. DO NOT BUY FROM T-D..hey don't give you option of exchanges-so they don't refund your shipping cost! EPIC FAIL! EFF THEM. Go buy from local Fry's so you can return it if it doesn't work. I can't believe this simple game pad would fail. What are the chances of that-for something that does not need drivers? Game pad is awesome in design and layout I must admit. I did not want an expensive ""gaming"" keyboard that had the same keys as a normal keyboard with fancy backlit keys. I want an ""add-on"" small keypad to compliment my ergo keyboard."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"The products does its job well enough I suppose. It does not allow you to program buttons per se, it has you alter the in game settings to match your needs and wants, however this often leads to the actual function of a key not matching what it woould normally do. For example, for Starcraft II, the Attack function, which is usually mapped to the A key is now mapped to F on the gamepad. Which is OKAY, but it forces you to relearn all your button functions, and in the heat of the moment its easy to forget what is what. My bigger complaint is that from time to time, at least once or twice a night, it'll go through a phase where buttons stops responding all together. It usually only lasts 30 seconds or so, but it is very annoying nonetheless. It's usable, but you get what you pay for."
5,Amazing,"Well, first of all, sorry for mi English, ain't not a native english Speaker.About Cyber Snipa, the product is REALLY AMAZING, it helps a lot the ""Butterfly"" Buttons (Q,W,E,A,S,D) that they are really needed for a FPS game. The Buttons are biggier than a normal Keyboard and the feel are very soft and ergonomic.I Play on a Laptop, and i'm a Battefield Heroes player (Profile: JABKILLER), i love this product, since i use it, i have increased my Kill death Radious and the keys are very easy to follow (Specially if u are playing on a poor light ambient). The best of all, u wont need to configurate the keypad, they are something like a ""Mid Keyboard"".Note for the laptop players, with CYBER SNIPA helps to prevent cracking or damaging the laptop Keyboard.Hope i help with this review, Best regards.JAB"
2,"Cheaply made and uncomfortable, poor customer service...","It functions, but is poorly made. The ""S"" button broke within a month, and when I tried to contact the maker the website was crappy and they didn't get back to me for about a month. Also it's not ergonomic as far as wrist positioning at all. I am replacing it, and wouldn't suggest buying it."
1,broke after a week,"Poorly manufactured, when it arrived the side lights didn't work, and it stopped working after a week. 4 stars to the seller, though! They offered to refund the product, I just never made it to the post office to send them the return. After reading reviews online of this gamepad, i'm staying away!"
5,Christmas Present,Bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter in law. She loved it. It was easy to order and have shipped.
3,Not the same as my wolfking,"I used to have a wolfking game pad, how ever they went out of business. My other game pad died and I was looking to something else that wouldn't break the bank. This is really good to use with shooters, but I found that when playing a game that you need to hit the numbers really fast to change weapons is a little more difficult. Needless to say I don't play as engineer on TF2 that much anymore."
4,can be improved,the game pad has definitely met my expectations BUT you must have a good usb port though. some of the keys well most of the keys seems to have a lag after i pressed them and it takes a second for them to respond.
1,Connector problems,"The information provided by Amazon.com said this Oxygen Sensor would fix my 2001 Chev. Silverado 2500 HD 4X4 pickup. The connector however was not the correct type as specified by Weseloh Chevrolet, Carlsbad, CA. The type required needed rounded corner edges not squared corners.The shipment was very fast, but incorrect."
4,book review,Bought for my 7 & 8 year old grand daughters because I read these as a kid - they love them. Good quality. I actually want to try and read them again if I get to where they live and get a chance. Would like to see if I can still enjoy them
4,good books,i bought them because my 10-year old son wanted them and he read them pretty quickly. he enjoyed them.
5,A blast from my childhood,These books bring me back to 3rd grade or so... and my 8 year old ate them up in a weekend.
4,Lauren Mackall's book review,"This story takes place in the Mountain View Inn. The main character in the book is a mouse named Ralph. Ralph finds a toy red motorcyle that he takes on all his adventures in the book. In the book Ralph gets himself in trouble by going to main floor of the hotel, but his new human friend Keith saves him. This book was really fun to read, and is full of adventures."
5,Folk music as it ought to be presented.,"Barry Dransfield's Wings of the Sphinx highlights the best of traditional and original song styles. Dransfield, a talented singer, fiddle, guitar, and cello player performs with a vitality that must be heard to be believed."
3,"Nice, but one big problem. . .","We love this screenhouse because you can see through it easily. But after having it up for a few months on our redwood deck, the roof seams are ripping! I think because the Insta-clip system puts stress on the roof material and causes it to rip at the seams. We now realize this item won't last even one year."
2,Ripped easily,"We put this tent up for a summer. Liked it well enough because the sides were vertical and it kept the rain out. However, we had trouble stretching the tent over the frame which put enormous stress on the fabric and the clips, some of which pulled off the frame. This year when we started to put it up again the roof fabric ripped at the seams and quickly spread further into the roof area. It's poor value if you want to use it for more than one season."
2,Mediocre,"The main appeal of this book is to get your children excited about baking and cooking. It's visually gorgeous, the baked goods are gorgeously deocrated and the recipes are easy to follow. My 8-year-old looks through it for fun and fantasizes about consuming large quantities of sugar. However, the product does not match the presentation. We've made five of the recipes in this book and would only make one again (the shortbread cookies -- how wrong can one go with butter, sugar and flour?). The spongecake was not tasty, the viennese cookies are really flour-y and not appealing, etc. Do not rely on these recipes for foolproof goodies that you would be proud to share with others. This is not that book."
1,Disappointing,"This book makes tiny recipes that are TONS of work. It is NOT an ""introduction"" to baking; most of the recipes are way more complicated than the ones I use as an adult. About 90% of the recipes call for some type of citrus fruit and that always involves zesting and juicing fresh fruit. What's up with that?Granted, there are some gems in here (the Mocha Cupcakes are to die for!) but if you're looking for easy baking to do with kids, don't buy this book."
2,Hideous!,"This dress is a good example of the problems with buying on line. The flimsy jersey material looks cheap and was already pilling when I received the dress. The web site says the dress hits at the knee. I'm 5'6"" and it went halfway down my calf - distinctly unflattering in an empire waist! A further word of warning: the top looked fine on me, but I am a 34DD. On anyone more traditionally sized, it would be a shapeless, flopping mess."
2,Cheaper than it looks,"I was diappointed with this dress when I got it. It looks much nicer in the picture than in person. I would've sent it back but its too much trouble to return it.Its basically a cheap, thin t-shirt with a nice satin ribbon tied around the waist."
2,DO NOT BUY,"this dress is terrible. while the material feels soft and comfortable, the fit is aweful. my chest pulled the dress up so that the satin bow did not sit right at the front. it is an awkward length that hits below the knee. it just doesn't look flattering at all. would never wear this in public"
4,comfortable but low,"The dress fit great and I was happy to have it. I looked everywhere in my area for a simple brown dress and couldn't find anything that wasn't a weird material that showed every body blemish or was a wrap dress. The dress neckline is very low, but I planned on buying camis of different colors to wear under it. The ribbon ""belt"" is pretty but doesn't always stay with the elastic waistband. There was only one belt loop, so that kept it from holding the belt in place. Very comfortable, size matched well, and looked good on me :)"
5,Contents (I just got this book.),"Section 1 Learn these firstChapter 1 Cappelletti Defense to 1NTChapter 2 Flannery Two DiamondsChapter 3 Bergen RaisesChapter 4 Responding to Three-bidsChapter 5 Four-Suit TransfersChapter 6 Gambling 3NTChapter 7 D.O.N.T.

1,What's in this book????,"I'm considering whether to buy this book since I enjoyed the earlier book but there is NO information provided. This is NOT like Amazon. Clicking on the Table of Contents brings up a supposedly earlier version of this book that has nothing to do with advanced bridge conventions.If anyone knows how to find out which conventions are described in the book, you would do a great service by letting the rest of us know."
3,What can I say - I just like this music!,"I grew up hearing my parent's music - big band swing from the '30s and '40s. Being a member of the generation that considered '50s and early '60s rock 'n roll ""our"" music, with everything else labeled as hopelessly square, the lilting rhythm and the chorus shouldn't have appealed to me. But the music on this album did from the first time I heard it, and it still sounds great almost fifty years later."
2,Good Performance but Poor Production Quality,"The cast, music and scenes are as good as one can expect from a stage opera. Voices are beautiful. But the video quality is not even as good as VHS - the DVD is probably a digital copy of the analog VHS to begin with. In addition, the video compression is poorly done, with ghost images that occur with fast movements. Audience noices are a big distraction. I also own a Gulda Mozart concert DVD made by Pioneer, same problem, ghost images and audience noices. Someboy also mentioned that Pioneer's ""Metropolitan Opera - Centennial Gala"" is also a low-quality production. Music lovers, when it comes to Pioneer Classics, think twice before you buy."
3,Good Met Performance,"As far as performances in large opera houses of La Boheme go this must surely be up there with the best, however, I can't get past the fact that something just doesn't click in this performance for me. All of the singers sing well and act well, Miss Stratas in particular, but there seems to be no real relationships built up during the course of the opera, so that in the final scene the only thing that made me cry was the emotional soaring of Puccini's music, not that Rodolfo had finally lost his beloved Mimi. Now if you can find the Covent Garden performance directed by John Copley with Ileana Cotrubas and Neil Shicoff you get the full deal; the music, the singing and the relationships...and a truly believable and outstandingly sung Marcello in Sir Thomas Allen."
1,Not for the average joe.,"I like Butterfly and Carmine but this Puccini pinches.For the diehead this may do. Not aye said the little brown rooster.The girl is funny looking, if you know what I mean."
3,Not the one your want,"I love the aria Che Gelida Manina, and Carreras gave the worst performance of this aria that I have ever heard (most notable in its transposition down from the high C). I strongly recommend the San Francisco Opera's La Boheme with Pavarotti and Freni, the singing is much stronger."
3,Spectacular except ...,"In 1982 Carreras was at his breathtaking finest, and this may well be his best performance ever. Scotto was dazzling and Richard Stilwell was a memorable Marcello. Unfortunately, there is also Teresa Stratas. She simply hasn't the voice for it, she does the eye-rolling thing so often that we frequently see only the whites of her eyes and she looks not so much fragile as dead .. since a week ago Monday. Still, the album is a keeper .. this is a heart stopping performance by Carreras."
2,Castles and Fortresses,"I really thought this book would be in better condition. Although I didn't expect it to be in mint condition, I was unpleasantly surprised to find that the binding was cracked, the front cover falling off and several of the pages loose. I probably won't buy another book in anything but 'new' condition."
2,A Matter of Style,Didn't like it. Felt the style of the art was too dark. I was expecting to see more classic styled characters. Instead it was all artists interpretations of the various characters of the Marvel Universe.This book was a gift for a child. Some of the drawings of women are questionable. I have decided not to give it to the child. The book received good ratings from other customers. It just wasn't to my liking.The quality of the book itself was good. Very colorful and the paper quality was very good (no seeing the picture on the other side of the page).
4,"Looking For The Original Version of ""Fool If You Think It's Over""?","If you expect to find the original version of ""Fool If You Think It's Over"" on this CD, you will not get it... You will find it on ""Hard To Find 45s on CD Volume 8 Seventies Pop Classics""... Spanish Language/ Si tu esperas encontrar la versión original de la canción ""Fool If You Think It's Over"" en este CD, acá no la encontrarás... Se halla en el CD ""Hard To Find 45s on CD Volume 8 Seventies Pop Classics""..."
5,An overlooked artist,"I was slightly aware of Chris Rea from occassional airplay/videaos, but only really heard a lot of his music on my XM, the XM Cafe channel in particular. I enjoyed it enough to actually BUY his CD. This album is an excellent sampling of his work over the years, with much variety. Bluesy rock tunes, nice ballads, etc. I particularily like his vocal delivery compbined with some very nice guitar work. I think that comparisons with the style and content of Leonard Cohen can be made, only Chris is more musical, in my opinion. Or maybe I just like the small night club groove with the wonderful Strat guitar rythyms. I used my free Pepsi iTunes winner to get another song I liked that isn't on this album, ""Looking for the Summer""."
2,Very Best of Chris Rea,The songs on this Cd are WONDERFUL as always for Chris Rea. The CD came with cracks and a broken case. Thank God there wasn't anything wrong with the CD.
4,"Its good, but becoming dated","I recently read this book and was pleased with its content. It covers all of the basic decisions one must make in setting up a woodworking shop. I particularly liked the way the photos depicted both store-bought items as well as woodworker-created ones. This trend allows one to see fancy expensive benches made in Europe as well as fully functional, creatively constructed benches built on a budget! The only real downside to this book is that its 1993 publication date means that it is starting to look a bit dated. While the photos are of excellent quality, they are all black and white. The tools in the photos were all top of the line in their day, but many are very dated now. All in all though, this is still a viable source of information for the beginning woodworker, or anyone who is looking to outfit a woodworking shop for the first time."
2,Only superficial,"Although I have not completed the book I've gotten to the first 7 chapters and I have not found it that enlightening. Most of the referenced shops are old and out of date. The depth of discussion is common sense at best. For example there is a chapter devoted to dust collection but no information on how to determine which size of collector is needed. Nothing on ducting size, determining static pressure loss, length of run, grounding techniques, etc. All very important in deciding how big a collector to buy and how to install. Yet the title implies it is a how to guide. Again very superficial on most topics covered. No guidance is supplied."
2,Just so so ...,"Not the best book in the world. I got this as a gift a while ago. I've just recently set up my shop, but this book didn't help at all. He has a few good ideas for jigs toward the end, but the rest is, as someone else reviewed, common sense at best. He really does gloss over a lot of details that should be covered in a good book on this topic. And he spends a LOT of time explaining what I, at least, think are simple things (types of table saws, brands and models (many outdated, as far as I can tell) of many different machines, etc. I have other much, much better books on woodworking. I would not say that this is anywhere near the best of them."
4,Book Corrections - part I,"First, a confusing omission on p118, eqn: 4.28.The transverse component should be defined first as:Mx'y' = Mx' + i My' = ...This omission may be confusing when the previous chapter is not read before this one, as the definition of Mx'y' is not defined earlier in this chapter.p.123 eqn: 4.43,Mxy should be labeled Mx'y', Mx and My should be Mx' and My'There should be an equals sign after defining Mx(w,(t1+t2)+) + iMy(w,(t1+t2)+)"
3,Go Finns!,"Being an avid dance music specialist, I admit that I have listened to most of Wild Life and have to say, I don't mind The Crash.Quality electroclash pop Finland!I think and Above and Beyond remix is well overdue."
5,"Realistic, practical, and uplifting","This is one of the best parenting books I've read. The views expressed are balanced and realistic. It also emphasizes the tween and teen years. Don't be misled by the title. It is not a book about attaching to your children. The book does an excellent job of discussing when to let go, when to accept your children and when to stay connected and protect them."
2,"Interesting Premise, but...","I thought that this book had a rather cool premise. In it, a bunch of random letters from famous authors to aspiring authors were found and published. As could be imagined, the quality varies greatly. Some are pretty much useless, some are full of interesting advice. Some advice is overly general, some too specific (and applicable only to the letter writer). I wish that the editor had better culled the letters to remove some of the ones that meander, discuss stuff that's too personal to be interesting to a random reader, etc. But there's at least some good advice to be found here.I'd probably recommend skimming, not buying this book. (Unless you're really into one of the listed authors and desperately want to know what he/she said about writing.)"
2,Patak's not that good,"Not a fan of Patak's sauces. Every time I try one it's too vinegary, almost bitter.I did Biryani and Korma last night and didn't enjoy either."
2,Not practical,Cute but hardly practical. The bears head is stuffed so it doesn't sit comfortably over your little one's head but flops all over the place. One wriggling baby plus flopping all over the place bear head makes baby wriggle even more and stresses the parents!Dad and I have decided it will make a delightful Carnival costume or dress up toy when he gets older:-)The better buy is the Carter's duck hoodie towel. It's not stuffed like the bear so it's a snug fit.
4,Works great for thin cuts of meat,"This tenderizer works very well for thin cuts of meat, like those used for country fried steak (about 1/4 inch max). The blades are too short for thicker cuts. For those, I would recommend the stainless steel needle tenderizers. Otherwise, its very easy to clean, fun to use, and does a great job!"
5,Meat tenderizer,Great meat tenderizer. I run the tenderizer both ways over the meat and then turn the meat over and run it again. I works great. If you are going to use a rub put the rub on first the work it into the meat. I think you will really like the product.
5,Great!,"This is by far my favorite video workout very do-able even for a beginner. I have more videos from the 10 min solution series and I love them all, however I find myself pulling this one off the shelf the most."
4,Good workout,I consider my self to be intermediate/advanced level. This made me sweat but didn't consider it to be too hard. Maybe intermediate at best. I really like it though. Love the punches with the weighted gloves.
5,A Great Workout!,"I bought this tape because I wanted to add a little variety to my workout routine. To be honest, I was surprised by the intensity of the ten minute segments. I thought they'd be slightly easier, but the instructor jumps right in and gets down to business, which is great! The bottom line, if you want to kick things up a notch, get this DVD and expect to sweat a lot!"
5,Fantastic workout in just a few minutes,"I love, love, LOVE this DVD! This was my first 10 Minute Solution workout DVD, and it's made me a fan. I find myself wanting to use this DVD more and more. Each workout is great on its own--though short! But putting several together in what order I choose makes this series special. I really like Jessica a lot. She's very positive and down-to-earth and cues well. The workouts make me actually break a sweat and feel like I've done something, even though the workouts are short. The weighted gloves enhance the workout, and can be used with other DVDs/exercises as well. I tend to get bored easily, and the fact that I can pick and choose and mix things up is a real plus. I've ordered several more 10 Minute Solution DVDs based on how much I enjoy this this one, and I'm sure I won't be disappointed. If you have trouble finding time to work out (like I do), you can't go wrong with this DVD! It's so easy to fit one or 2 or more of these into your day!"
5,Love the Gloves!!,I have several of the 10 Minute Solution workouts and this one is my favorite so far!! The love the weighted gloves! This workout gets my heartrate up and I do feel like I get a total body workout.
1,Not what I expected,The work out in the video wasn't very effective. Not as intense! I was expecting to sweat more and definitely didn't feel it on my body the fallowing day.
5,Awesome workout,"Love these five awesome workouts. They are fun, quick, and exciting. Really works you out! Great moves and fun to do."
2,"Nice DVD..gloves, not so much","I received this as a gift. I wanted weighted gloves and my dh thought these would be great since they came with a DVD. I must say, the DVD is fine. I had no problem following along, and I did find that it was a nice, quick workout. Sadly, the gloves are not that great. I suppose they are okay if you are only using them for 10 minutes at a time. However, I use them for 45 minute Turbo Kick classes as well. They became so stretched out after only a couple of classes, that now I can barely keep them on my hands. If you are like me, and really just looking for weighted gloves, I would not recommend this product."
2,Gloves are cheap & damaged,"I do like the video, it is a great workout. However, I was very disappointed with the gloves. I should have just purchased authentic piloxing gloves. I would return them but with the money I spent on shipping it's not worth it. They are very cheap quality and are already falling apart after 2 uses. The threads are coming undone in several places, the velcro is peeling off, and the material is thin and cheap and probably toxic too since it was made in China."
2,No Instructions Given-Not for Kickboxing Newbies,I bought this thinking it would be fun and easy to follow since it came from the 10-min solution products. However you go straight into a fast moving section and the instrutor gives you no instructions or explenations of the moves(she does do some explaining is a different segment)so I was left standing there going HUH? which when your trying to excercise is counterproductive. The only good thing about this is the gloves that I use with different workouts.If you don't have a kickboxing base or alot of time to just watch and flounder through until you can finally get it. Don't waste your money
2,Very Disappointing,"I would not waste my money on this if I were you. It's not accurate when it comes to reading your movements especially on the ball return and dodge ball segments. Sometimes your WII person is swinging their arms and you haven't even moved. The graphics are terrible. The people look deformed. Once again it takes longer to get set up to do the exercise than it takes to actually exercise. Slow movements and way too much down time. It is not really a 10 minute work out since you can only do one five minute and then a break while it reloads the next five minute segment. I'm still waiting for a good exercise program that is fun to do, gives you a good consistent work out and doesn't have a bunch of extra stuff that slows it down."
5,Love it!,"I mostly go to the gym, but I wanted to try out something new so that I do not ""plateau"". This is a great, simple yet effective workout DVD. It's such a good idea to break the workouts up into 10 minute segments. I'm definitely NOT a workout DVD veteran (this is my first one). She is a great instructor. I've done this DVD about 5 times now and it just gets better.The ab workout is especially great! It's only 10 minutes but it seriously works."
3,Not too thrilled,"Workouts are ten mins, which is great for my busy schedule. But, this girl has no rhythm. Her workouts are uncoordinated. I feel like I'm spending most of my time trying to get the footwork and not really working out."
4,So much fun!,"This is my first 10 Minute Solution DVD and I had a blast! Not only was it a great workout but with it being broken up into 10 minute segments, I found myself finishing up one and thinking ""yeah I could do another."" I only stopped at 4 because I was had other things to do haha! It was a GREAT workout and just a ton of fun! She is a great instructor and it while some of the moves are a little tricky, she's really good with her cues and keeping you moving the entire time. Also, I really like the gloves. They do fit me a little awkwardly and by the time I'm done I'm a little sore where the gloves rubbed up against my skin but its a minor discomfort and simply because of how they fit me.I would absolutely recommend this DVD! I've tried a lot and this one is definitely a fun one to add to my collection!"
3,Hard Water Owners BEWARE,"We have only had this system 1 month and we had to take the whole thing apart and soak it in Vinegar for nearly 8 hours and that still didn't get all the deposits off the titanium plates. DO NOT SCRUB THE PLATES! Titanium is a soft metal and you will actually deteriorate the metal if you do scrub it. Soak it in vinegar and run hot water through the plates. I am hoping that all this work is just from the pool getting all the calcium deposits out of the water from when we filled it up. Won't be taking this pool down and refilling it from summer to summer. NOT worth having to take the whole pump apart again. Other than that, it works great."
3,Problems every time I use it,"I purchased this item to use with my intex 12 x 36 metal frame pool. I continuously have problems with insufficient water flow (error 90). I have to clean the filter everytime I use it. If I had the choice again, I would probably pick the ""all-in-one"" version that includes the pump. This way the whole system could work on a timer. Right now, I have to manually operate the pump."
3,Read before buying,"Not impressed with the quality of Intex products. Wish I had checked out the BBB Los Angeles website before purchasing to see that their efforts to resolve a complaint end as ""Refuse to adjust, relying on terms of agreement"" the majority of the time."
1,Salt Water Above Ground Pool Intex Chlorine Generator,"INTEX Pool Saltwater Chlorine Generator Chlorinator NEWDeluxe Saltwater SystemWe put this sytem on our pool 2 yrs ago. Everytime the lights flicker you have to go reset. It requires constant monitoring to insure it is running. During vacation our pool turned green because it went off. After 13 months the eye went bad. We followed the instructions to the T. Since it was our first sytem we tried the same model again, thinking maybe we just got a bad one. Same problems only this one lasted 9 months. It only runs half the time because you never know when it goes off. We are switching to another brand. Don't waste your time or money on this one!"
5,Great,"We only have the 12ftX3ft pool, so we needed to upgrade our filter to use it. But, it has been well worth it. We never have to buy expensive, dangerous, toxic chemicals again. I check the levels about once a week. If the levels are too high or low, I just adjust the run time. It's fabulous! For a pool our size it's only about 1 hour/ day."
1,Intex Salt Water System,"We wanted to do the salt water system as it seemed a safer alternative all around, as opposed to Chlorine. We made the investment and purchased the Intex Salt Water System. We have followed the instructions to the detail and have been ""attempting"" to use this thing for the last couple of months. It is the most temperamental peice of equipment I have EVER used! I am out there literally every day trying to address a digital code alarm for various reasons. While we gave it the ole' college try... we are getting rid of this thing. We have also had a number of aggressive water beetles invade our pool. Our friends that have the chlorine version of our pool do not have this issue. Chlorine it is!"
5,Why didn't I do this sooner?,"I love this thing. Easy install, easy setup, which resulted in ridiculously easy upkeep of my pool. So much easier than using chlorine tabs, powder, shock treatments, algae control, etc.I've run the same EZ set pool (18' round by 56"") for several years, using chlorine tabs etc for the upkeep. This past summer I installed the salt water system based on a friends input. My only regret is I didn't do it sooner. The water is silky smooth, no salt taste. No fear of algae bloom (copper ions eliminate algae growth possibility). This is first year in many that I didn't come home from summer vacation to a green swamp of a pool. After 7 days of being away it was crystal clear and ready for use with absolutely no pre-vacation prep and no post-vacation cleanup.Buy it and you'll love it too."
2,Loved it ... for the 2 months it lasted...,"It was love at first sight, this was the best thing EVER for my pool.. no shocking, no chlorine, awesome soft water, crystal clear always. But now it's eroded a hole at the top of the cell which leaks all the time unless I close off the pool valves. It doesn't appear to be a part that I can replace so now I have to take up the battle on the warranty or pay the money to replace it. But already, several days without it running, my pool should be a frogpond in no time :( I will update if they replace the unit quickly and I change my opinion, but I doubt it. I'm sure that somehow this 2 month life expectancy is my fault."
2,Piece of junk!,"Worked for s few days, then got the low flow code. Fixed that, now have a low salt code, even though we just added six more bags of salt. Big pain in my tooshie...will stick with chlorine next year!"
2,sun fades LED read-out,Help! If I purchase a new one I will need to cover the face to protect from fade. You can't set what you can't see. Any suggestions?
5,Very Convenient and Easy to Use,This Saltwater System is an excellent product especially for new pool owners who have no idea about what chemicals are needed to keep the pool clean and clear. Only need to buy a 40 lb bag (or more) of pool salt and you're good to go.
2,Don't order from 7th Avenue Store!!,"I purchased the product from 7th Avenue Store!!! BAD IDEA!!! taxes, fees, and return policies are AWFUL!!! I tried to return the product and was treated extremely rudely!! I have never received such treatment thru Anazon sellers!!! This is one company that I will never order from again! honestly cannot actually comment on the quality of the product,because I could not get it hooked up to my pool. but I have to say that it is not compatible with all above ground pools!! The saltwater generator should have adapters that a re compatible with all above ground pools! It would be good if the company included some other pool adapters without the customer's needing to search for a cure to the problems!"
2,Saltwater System,"We purchased this and just shy of a year it stopped working, they did replace it under warranty, but that process took 5 weeks. The replacement has now stopped working... 2 years 2 units... not a good track record I would not recommend this for long term use. It is an awesome product while it is working. My husband is a stickler for premaintenance and takes care of this unit exactly as the instructions state... but now, I have a pool full of salt water.. and have to decide what to do from here....Unhappy customer."
5,Very pleased,I was very satisfied with the product and the prompt service I recived with my purchase. I will have no problem with calling on this company again for another.
5,Religious Liberty and Natural Law,"I cannot recommend this book more highly to those interested in church/state relations, especially from a Catholic perspective. John Courtney Murray had a profound influence on the notion of Religious Liberty found in Dignitatis Humanae and in other documents of Vatican II. This work, by Robert W. McElroy, gives a very methodical, broad, and clear review of Murray's social philosophy. It is the only work, to date, that encompasses Murray's whole vision, and explains for the layman some of the more difficult notions of the Natural Law. Since Murray published few books, and wrote articles primarily for periodicals, this overview is invaluable. Do not expect to find a liberal or conservative slant, here. Murray's work seems to find a remarkable middle-way that is neither diluted nor duplicitous."
5,The Heavenly Village: A heavenly read,My nine year old daughter brought this book home from her school library and passed it on to me after she read it. I read it in less than an hour and it made me cry at the end. I like to think that there really is such a place! The tear jerker for me was when God visits the potter and he's just a little shy about bothering him so late at night while he's working. I never thought of God as being shy. I'm going to buy a few copies for gifts and myself!
5,Wonderful book!,"This is a wonderful book. It made me cry a little but because it made me happy, not sad. I just loved it. It is not just for children."
5,i love this book,this book is awesome i think that anyone who has a creative mind should read this book or the van gogh cafe. these 2 books are my favorites books in the world im 13 and they have been since i was 8 haha
5,Touching and thought provoking!,"This book is going on my bookshelf next to ""Jonathan Livingston Seagull"" and ""Godbody"" There is more to this book than I ever expected. Her kids books are fantastic and so is this one. I don't think I've ever read a book by her that I didn't like."
2,Children's?,"I can't imagine why this book is classified as a work for children other than the large type and brief text. Each chapter tells of a person who wasn't quite ready to enter heaven (mostly adults) so they go to the Heavenly Village as a kind of halfway mark. While Rylant does use poetic language to create some poignant moments in this collection, the work does not move together as a whole. Further, the ""rules"" of the village are not consistent. For example, at one point, we are told that time moves according to Earth time, later, Rylant states that the people can jump ahead a week or two in a flash if they wish. This work might appeal more to adults who may appreciate the language and find comfort in the idea of a safe harbor in the afterlife."
2,What I Think,"I think this book skips around to much and doesn't stay on the same supject for long enough and it just sort of drags on forever, or so it seems. I did not like the book much."
2,match,Very disappointed in these earrings. Only has one little red speck on them. Don't look anything like what is published.
4,Great story and graphics pitting the Dark Knight against death itself...,Very well written story that draws you in and keeps you asking for more. Batman fans will love this! Alien fans will love this! New readers to either series will love this book! Should be a movie! A must have!
4,The best Darkhorse/D.C. comic I read so far,"I read the reviews about bva, heard a friend talk good things about it, plus it looked cool, so I got it.I read 3 more times.its that good. Im not a die hard, or huge fan of the batman and aliens, but the comic looked good so I got. The story was great and full ok suprises. The art is great even for todays standerds. The plot was very creative, and not just thrown together.The aliens are great, but theirs only 4 of them but one thats like 10 times bigger then batman shows up a the end.puls all these other D.C./Darkhorse crossovers like SvA,(superman),SvP,Greenlantern v.s alien,are just gay. This story makes alot of sence then these others, and batman dosen't have any powers to lose so the battles even. Put this book at the top at your list. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because the last alien died to fast."
5,Abstracts-A Delight to Read,"This book is for readers who enjoy everything from essays, holiday literature or poetry to comedy, sports and science fiction. The Abstracts editors and staff have written and compiled a delightful read."
4,Great!,if you like old flicks you'll love this. i was scared when i saw this for the first time. its pretty spooky!
3,I just kept wishing they werent so paranoid!,"I just didnt get it! I mean the story was great, dont get me wrong.... But why on earth did they keep thinking it was sabotage when there were so many other ships caught in this ""cybersong""?? They hinted that it couldnt be Cardassians because of all the other ships...but they still didnt go with it. Tovok went off on a tangent and everyone followed him! Everyone just thought that Tovok must be right... And it wasnt until late in the book that they all started thinking 'Hey what about that transmission the alien ship sent' But even then Tovok and Chakotay was still going on about Cardassians! I did like the ending though...And thats why it got an extra star."
3,A Little Boring...,"This novel was a little boring in places, but not bad. Some of the things/choices were a bit 'odd' after having watched the show for 7 seasons, but nothing too annoying for a Star Trek novel.The reason I gave it three instead of four stars, however, has to do with the plot. It sat there. Then went back and seemed to repeat some of the events and sat there some more. Yes, there was action and suspense in this novel, but somehow they got drawn out so it got a bit boring. This wasn't one of those 'can't put it down', but it wasn't as bad as it could have been.I'd recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys reading the Star Trek books. I personally got a bit bored and thought about skipping ahead a little bit (but I didn't!), but I think reading it wasn't that bad either."
4,Good if you like Star Trek,"I read many Voyager books, It is the best I read, but I think that the plot is great for those that enjoy Star Trek and Computers. If you don't like this topics, I think that 3 stars would be fine, instead of 4."
5,Inspiring,"I wish that I had received this book before I started my latest project - a fabric altered book round robin. It covers techniques, projects and an inspiring gallery section. Some of the books illustrated are completely made from fabric, while others use ordinary books that have been decorated with fabric and sewing supplies and techniques.The photos are clear and well labelled. Instructions are set out clearly and easy to follow. After reading this book I have a list of techniques and designs to try out. This is a worthwhile addition to your altered book library."
3,Too basic...definitely not innovative,"I expected much more from this book, but found it to be too basic. The techniques featured were very simple. Calling them innovative is quite a stretch. I also felt that too many pages were devoted to non-fabric techniques and ideas. Too much of the book was devoted to the basics of creating altered books and things like using gesso on board books, setting eyelets, etc.. Also there was a section on using tissue paper, which isn't fabric...it's paper. I found most of the ideas for fabric to be very simple and basic. I've hardly worked with fabric but found most of what was in the book to be a ""no brainer"". The title of this book is very misleading. It's a great book for someone who is just getting into altered books and collage. But if you already know how to alter books and aren't a beginner, you may find that several parts of this book are useless to you."
1,Disappointed with this one,"Although the book is a photographic delight, if I wanted to see other people's work, I would have bought a copy of Somerset Magazine.I was hoping to learn the mechanics of how to construct a fabric book. There wasn't a word about that subject.Anyone who is already into Altered Art would not learn much from this book. She does cover some techniques and shows a lot of other people's art work, but this book was not what I had hoped for."
4,Good for ideas,I like the techniques and ideas given in this book. Instructions are good and I use the methods as a starting point for my work.
3,Title is Misleading,"After working with artist journals, altered books, and some basic handmade book styles in paper, I was ready to incorporate fabric into my range of materials. When I purchased this book, The Art of Fabric Books, I was hopeful that it would guide me into just that; making books using fabric. What I found instead was more of the same technique information covered in many other books about working with mixed media. Finally, on pages 59-62 there is a Fabric Tag Book; on 66-68, a folded fabric book; and on 69-70 a book with fabric pages that is wrapped in twill tape or ribbon. I have found the most inspiration by browsing through the gallery of artists, which showed many examples of ways to use fabric in book arts projects, but as another reviewer mentioned, you can do that by picking up a magazine. My suggestion for a more accurate title is right on the back cover: Fabric and Altered Books~the perfect creative combination."
1,Not Ready for Prime Time,"Unfortuntely I can not recommend this book.We love to cook and when we have guests visiting, a breakfast souffle always brings exclaimations of delight. We have several ""standard"" souffles that we make for these occasions and wanted to branch out and learn about others.Unfortunately when we tried several souffles from this book all of them failed. It almost appeared that the author never tested them herself. A friend (also an excellent cook) who borrowed the book from us also met the same fate.We were only able to get these recipes to work after several attempts but found in each case we had to significantly modify ingredients, proportions, and instructions so that in the end the recipe looked completely different from what was written in this book."
1,"non-Christian, eastern bias?",This book gives an overview of the more popular religions of the world but I think it's written from a skeptical point of view or possibly leaning toward eastern philosophy. This may be because they tried to stay neutral but it would have been better if they had believers from each religion write the section on that religion.This book did not fulfill my needs of giving an unbiased overview of various religions and I was unable to finish it as I felt it was a waste of time.
5,Yet another Barry Friedman Fan Club Member,"I perused all the Amazon[.com] reviews on this book and they all read like a broken record - brilliant,authoritative, witty, glorious, even the Bible.So I invested my money and read the book and all those adjectives happen to be absolutely, positively correct.Amazon[.com] allows reviews of 1,000 words. Only three are necessary - BUY THIS BOOK!"
3,Incredible material...careless production,"I love early Cajun, and I particularly love the soulful singing of Ardoin. The CD contains most, but not all of his recordings but unfortunately, about 1/2 on this set are in extremely poor sound quality when I am sure that collectors out there have very clean copies. All of the Decca sides though sound great. This is a must have collection for the Cajun collector."
3,love the game but hate the zippers,We received this as a gift for Christmas. The first day we inflated the inner ring the zippers broke. They were not fixable. I am considering trying another one. It would be so much fun if it were better constructed.
3,"Fun toy, but defective","Our grandsons LOVED receiving the Dart Ball game. Unfortunately, the first day they played with it the stitching on the zipper came undone so it was useless.I was VERY IMPRESSED with how quickly we received a refund for the boy. If the zippers were stitched better it would really be a fun game, but whenever they pulled the velcro balls off, the stitching unraveled."
1,Broken in less than one hour,"I bought this for my son, I played it with him and we were having fun for about an hour, unfortunately the zipper broke after that. Poor quality construction."
3,Not the way I remember it on TV - VHS is edited?,"Walter Matthau is at his best as a 60's swinging drunk, and Anne Jackson is charming in this movie that, if remade, could feature Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. One note, I watched this movie on the 'Late Late Late Show' many moons ago, and I think this VHS version of the movie might be an edited version, as I believe the TV version was much 'racier' than this tape. This tape version is slightly more than a ""G"" but less than a ""PG"", but most certainly not an ""R"" as there is no nudity or vulgar language - everything is merely suggested. So I'm surprised that the tape is probably sanitized, and doesn't merit an ""R"". Ratings questions aside, it is a cute movie, and a great look back at the late 60's. A real 'swinging' movie taking you back to the ""Austin Powers"" party times."
2,Must contextualize,"The information is, at best, suspect. The prose is labored, the organization of the book almost laughable. Interesting if only to see what passed for musicology about a hundred years ago."
5,The Miles Davis of Guitar.,They will catch up with this one. This will be ranked with Beetoven 50 years from now. Ahead of his time.
5,Essential,"While Frank is well known for his sleazy humor, his guitar skills are often overlooked by non-Zappaphiles... this is a shame, because he is quite possibly the greatest electric guitarist that there has ever been. Remember, virtuosos like Vai and Belew played rhythm behind Zappa! This album really showcases his mind blowing virtuosity and unparalleled improvisational abilities. Stated simply, this is absolutely essential listening for any guitar player, Zappa fan, or just anyone who can appreciate master practicing his craft."
5,the definitive masterpiece,It is simply the most amazing record I have ever heard in my life in any kind of music styles.And it contains the best drumming ever recorded in history.
2,guitar jam session,If I was a guitar player I'd give it five stars but... The drummer is very good. Three disks of guitar solos. No arrangements. No production. No song-writing. Just two-chord progressions backing Frank while he jams.
3,A star for each disc,"Everyone should just shutup and let Frank play the guitar.Blah, blah, blah. I'd like to see any of you put out a 3-CDset of music or anything for that matter. You think you knowso much, why don't you just shut up and play your guitar.Heavy duty Judy and Hog Heaven were my wedding songs."
1,for addicts only,"if you don't already own all FZ albums and like his guitar, try anything from ""hot rats"" up to now before wasting your money on this... at least, you'd have some fun included."
5,great shoe,Needed this black shoe for work....it has proven to be comfortable and is holding up so far.
2,Tragically Flawed,"Why, oh why, did they litter up what would have been a great soundtrack with all of the samples of movie dialogue? The music is a great blend of stylish and classic tunes that set the mood wonderfully in the movie, and they would have stood on their own beautifully on the soundtrack. However, every song begins with about a 15 second clip of talking over the music, which is incredibly distracting and takes away from the vibe that the music alone would have created. Truly a disapointment -- some really good songs get ruined, and a soundtrack that would have been up there with ""Rushmore"" falls flat."
3,"Okay, but...","I would have preferred not to have the dialogue mash into the tracks. It's typical of Soderbergh soundtracks, and I don't mind the dialogue being there, I'd just prefer it on its own track (like, say, the Snatch soundtrack)."
2,Please re-release with ALL tracks in instrumental format,"The music in Ocean's Eleven is nothing short of brilliant, but this soundtrack release is a let-down. The issues:1. dialogue inserted over music (not necessarily matching where it landed in the movie)2. music is missing (where's the cool intro tune where Clooney gets out of jail?)3. tracks are typically incomplete (either fade out or get cut off)Not that there's any chance of a re-release, but it would be nice to have all the orginally scored music in its complete, instrumental form."
3,If you really want the music....,"DAVID HOLMES made a name with this soundtrack, and to get his name out, he sent out a PROMO COPY for the OSCAR race. now, i don't normally recommend downloading music but it IS ILLEGAL to buy this CD as it was not intended to be bought. i am lucky to OWN it as i bought it on EBAY it its THE ENTIRE SCORE - NO DIALOGE. Its less then 45 mins in length and has 35 tracks if i am not mistaken. it worth getting. my friend have downloaded it off of TORRENTRACTOR or TORRENTSPY and i recommend you do that, plus add the tracks you get here and make a COMPLETE soundtrack. that what i did."
4,a rare gem from belfast,"unlike other reviews on this page ,,, i find the dialogue between tracks does work ... i find it recreates the mood ,,, and i bought this album long before i saw the movie !!i purchased this album with confidence knowing i have never been dissapointed with holmes work in the past ,, ( i thought lets get killed was ingenius ) ..on this album holmes sticks to a formula that worked so well on "" out of sight "" by using his own tracks in tandem with the likes of perry como and elvis ...."
2,Shame on this soundtrack,Why have they put in dialogue on the score? David Holmes did a excellent work but they ruind it. This is not a real soundtrack. Why didn't they do a cd with just the dialogue instead? They sould have released only a soundtrack with the original score with NO dialogue.
2,Why are there voices on my cd?????,"I cannot remember the last time I bought a movie soundtrack, but I absolutely love the music to this movie. So why am I so disappointed? Because there are more voices on the cd than music. Every song begins with far too much dialogue from the movie. It's a disruptive device! I want the music only. If I wanted the dialogue, I would watch the dvd. I now own a cd that I will probably never listen too."
3,Not great,"I don't mind the dialogue on this CD, but it would be better if it were separated from the music a little more..."
2,Why oh why...,"They did the same damn thing that screwed up the would-be amazing sountrack of ""out of sight""...yes, there's bits of movie dialogue slipped in making the music tragically un-listenable. The movie was fun, that doesnt mean we want to hear the movie while we listen to the music."
2,"A little less conversation, a little more music...",Too much dialogue! Every single song on this album has little snippets from the movie. I bought this album mostly for the main theme that runs right when Ocean gets out of jail and when the title rolls. It is nowhere to be found on this cd. Dont waste your money.
1,A brilliant soundtrack spoiled...,This would be a great cd if it were not for the dialogue inserts. The dialogue is badly edited and poorly selected. If you want hear the dialogue with the music you can... IN THE MOVIE! I am going to have to make my own version of this cd with only the music tracks. I do not reccomend buying this cd.
3,"Same Issue As Others: Good Music, Dialog Distracting","Like many of the other reviewers, I really enjoy the music tracks on the album. Definitely not all, but most, and a few songs are absolutely standout (Tess, $160 Million Chinese Man). BUT, the insertion of dialog throughout is a distracting buzzkill. Even if you don't mind it at first, when you are playing your favorite songs for the 100th time, the dialog gets extremely old! Also, I was amazed that the inserted dialog wasn't even the actual dialog occuring while the track was playing during the movie. They just inserted it on the soundtrack needlessly. Getting beyond it, I would still recommend the album for the enjoyable tunes. FYI - the Oceans 12 soundrack has no dialog, and has many enjoyable tracks as well."
3,Pretty good but no cigar?,I liked a lot of the music in Ocean's II - new and old. The problem is when they put dialog over the top of cool Funk tunes. There's a couple tracks like this on the CD... I don't want to hear George Clooney's vioce on my CD player dammit! Otherwise it has good tracks.
1,Horrible,"I bought this after seeing this entertaining movie---it's a lot better than the critics are saying---and have never been more disappointed in a cd purchase. I immediately wished I'd bought it somewhere with a liberal return policy instead of a store going out of business because I would have taken it back after listening to the first track. Why? Dialogue excerpts over most of the music and a wretched, out-of-place, rap tune almost off the top. There should be a warning sticker on this (and any) soundtrack that has dialogue excerpts so people know what they're buying. Very disappointed."
4,For the Circus Animals!,i don't want to write an over analyzed review of this soundtrack But what i do want to say is if you're looking to hear the same great music that you heard in the movie& music that made you look this CD up in the first place...you've got it here! you will be able to draw visuals of the movie while listening to it. from Brad Pitt's bar lounge scene to the ending scene in front of the fountain in Vegas...don't over analyze this CD...it's fun and contains all the great tunes from the movie!!! if you're a fan of the Ocean's movies...but this CD!!!
2,So Much for Ambience,"I bought this CD hoping to capture the mood of the film. I didn't bargain for out of context dialogue to overlap the intros to each song. It ruins the mood for me when the scene is already set up by the snippet from the movie. C'mon, guys n' girls--I'm supposed to have my own memories that these songs bring back! Don't beat me over the head with yours!The Pulp Fiction soundtrack added charcter to its CD by making the featured dialogue separate tracks. I wish they had done that here. It would be worth the money then. As it is now, I'd pass if I had to do it all over again."
4,Very Good,There is only one problem with this cd its missing two tracks from the movie its missing Percy Faith - Rodney Yates and Percy Faith - Moon River other than that its good my favorite song besides Elvis' song is $160 million chinese man and Theme for young lovers is pretty good too. Its worth the money
2,Disappointing?,"I picked up this album looking to add the cool filler tracks used in the movie's score (you know the jazzy upbeat riffs) into my MP3 player mixes. You get those (and the Elvis ""A Little Less Conversation"" track) but there were two things that ruined this soundtrack for me.1. Almost all of the tracks contain dialogue voice overs from the movie, even the catchy tracks I was looking for weren't just music, they all contained dialogue to get in the way of the music.2. Even the Elvis song I wanted to get a copy of was faded out before it was over (something that happens to all of the tracks here) and blended into the next track on the CD.I guess if my description fits what you're looking for then pick this up. If you are looking for the same thing I was then I might suggest listening to this at the library or someplace else before spending your money on this."
3,It's the music....stupid!,"This is the perfect cocktail party CD. Unfortunately, the constant and distracting snippets of dialogue from the movie ensure that I will never play it at one of my parties. I'll have to settle for cleaning my house to it.Funky, swingy, modern, COOL - that's what this soundtrack is. Music to shake a martini to, get ready for a big date to, dance with your toddler to.Yes, I loved the movie. Yes, I loved the music. Why must hollywood mix these two together? This soundtrack could easily stand on its' own, it did not need the dialogue to remind us how cool the movie was. In fact, this soundtrack ranks right up there with ""Forest Gump"" as one of the great soundtracks. Thank Goodness the Gump folks didn't pepper the soundtrack with ""stupid is as stupid does"" and ""Run Forest, RUN!""."
3,missing track,just to let everyone know the main track from the movie is called MSP by chico hamilton==
5,Best Buy Ever!!,"I had read previous reviews of the talking in the CD...was not at all bothered by this and think it adds to the soundtrack. Just the right mix of Rat Pack cool with recent sounds...both blended very well into each other...I have played this CD over and over...if you enjoyed the movie, you will like trying to place each song in the story...this soundtrack does not fail!!!"
3,Disappointing to say the least,"I was really disappointed with this soundtrack. As many others have mentioned, the voice-overs from the movie really ruins it for me. I want to hear the music. If I wanted to hear dialogue, I would watch the movie. However, another reason I'm disappointed is the first song from the movie (The one that starts when Danny Ocean leaves prison and heads to Atlantic City) isn't in it. This is a great piece and I wish they would have released that track.IF they happen to re-release this, and IF they fix these two glaring problems, I will definitely pick up that version as David Holmes did a fantastic job with the composition of these tracks.As it is right now, I am very disappointed with the CD as-is."
2,Voices,This soundtrack has such good music but the constant and bothersome dialogue is a major turn off.
5,Good Music,"I found this CD to re-capture the fun of the movie. The music was excellent as well as i thorouglly enjoyed the clips from the movie. The Track ""Clair de Lune"" is absolutely beautiful. And fan of the movie would greatly benefit from this purchase."
4,Great soundtrack on par with Out Of Sight,"A lot of comparison has been made between this soundtrack and that for Out Of Sight which has the same Director, Composer, and a couple of the same stars as well. The dialogue does feel a little unnecessary (and a bit mumbled) at times. Looked upon on it's own merits however I think after a couple of listens this album grows on you. The Elvis track, ""69 Police"" by David Holmes, and ""Clare De Lune"" are the standout tracks in my opinion. Overall: not 100% perfect but definately a lot lot better than a few of the other reviews would have you believe"
1,INCOMPLETE,"this CD is lame.... why you ask? Well, first of all some of the tracks have annoying film dialogue spliced in so if you like hearing a certain song on the track over and over, you're forced to hear the damn dialog from the film. Yeah, that's what I'd love to hear is dialog that if I wanted to listen to, I'd rewind the movie over and over... that's a nuisance, but worse, is the fact that there are about 3 or 4 tracks that were played in the film that are missing here. explanation? who knows, shame on WB for churning out this crappy cd. You'd figure there are certain tracks on the cd that are only 5 second long dialog sequences from the film, that they'd be able to fit in some of the MUSIC from the movie not the damn dialog. Regardless, there are tracks missing and if I want to listen to them, I have to watch the movie... very dissapointing do not give this cd any chance"
3,not bad at all,"Well to tell you the truth, I don't know what is it with soundtracks not including all of the songs you hear in the film.In this one, I was perticulary looking forward to hearing the song when george Clooney is stepping out of prison. The same one is on the trailer. But, it's just not there. The rest of the soundtrack, featuers some very good tunes. It's fun it's lively but after hearing some of them for more than once, they are increadibly boring. So, all in all, I don't think that is worth bying it. You can benefit more by just renting the film one more time. And ergarding the movie dialogue in the soundtrack, I usually would have no objections, most of the time it's fun to listen to some laughs again, but this time it's simply too much. Half of the dialogues are boring and not fun at all or they are too long. In the end I'd like to say that beside two or three tracks, the rest is not worth the trouble of listening."
4,Still a favorite,The first season of Alaska State Troopers is still my favorite. Even with a new season on tv you can still watch past seasons and not get bored.
4,Way Too Short...,"I love this show (especially Trooper Howie Peterson) and was really excited to get this Season but it was entirely too short and for the price, it was not worth it. I would definitely wait until this goes to $15 or less. What I really enjoyed about this documentary compared to other cop shows, it has the wildlife aspect to it, so they explain a lot of the laws Alaska has concerning the protection of their wildlife which I think adds a real humane aspect to it. Definitely a great Season to watch and I will be buying the rest of the seasons."
5,Love this show,"This is a great show, the troopers are great, and the scenery is stunning. I've always wanted to visit Alaska, and now even more."
5,Interesting and funny series,"You wouldn't expect a show about state troopers to be that funny, but I was laughing so hard from the first episode on.Some gems include:Narrator: ""The driver's caught with a rum and coke, mixed in a salad dressing jar.""andWoman: ""He's had about 10 shots and 12-14 beers.""Trooper: ""Would you say he's intoxicated then?""Woman: ""Oh yeah.""On top of having its humorous moments, the show gives us a glimpse of what it's like to live in the beautiful but rugged state of Alaska."
1,Very Hollow Sounding,"These have to be about the most hollow sounding earphones I've ever heard. I bought them because they are supposedly built to match the Sansa e280 player I have. I'm very disappointed. The stock earphones sound so much better, which isn't good either."
3,"Good bass, overall poor quality sound","I bought two pairs of these earphones off Woot. I'm tired of spending $60+ for earphones that I lose. My last pair were Yuin PK2s :( Being an audiophile, my standards for sound quality are high but I don't find these Maximo iMetal phones even mediocre. The wiring for sound attunes these iMetal phones for a powerful bass, which depletes the high/midrange tones which sound like Mono instead of Stereo. (If you know how the wiring works you'll know that this is only logical, headphones can't have strong bass and strong high range, at the least they can be average with both) Most music isn't completely bass, unless you're a death metal fan, so these phones are very unpleasant to listen to overall."
3,Good earphones,"I bought these as a replacement for my J-bud earphones which only lasted 2 months before one of the earbuds failed. I expected these earphones to last a long time since they come with a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer, and so far, I have had mine for almost a year and they still sound great.Edit (Sept 2012): These earphones lasted me 6 months. I am now using myShure SE110 Sound Isolating Earphone with Balanced Armature Driver (Black)which I bought four years ago."
2,died after 5 month's,"I loved these earphones for my sansa, but now they are dead, it's like it was yust yesterday in september when i bought these, now the left one does not give me any sound and the right one is dying, sorry but for the price i thought i would last a year or so. i only used it for college nothing else."
5,Great set of buds,"I'm not sure about the noise cancellation thing, since all I listen to is noise anyway, but these buds are better than any I have ever had come with any mp3 player I have owned.They fit comfortably in the ear, have a rich sound for the type of music I listen to (Alternative electronic etc), and the rubberized coverings on them have stayed on over many months. (Unlike an overpriced set I bought from Apple with a fancy case that the were useless and cheap sounding, even though they were 30 bucks).As far as tweaking them for the Sansa I don't know, man. That sounds like more of a sales gimmick than anything else. They sound the same whether I'm listening to a shuffle (which I sold, absolutely worthless), my Crackberry when I forget my Sansa 4 gig clip, and when I plug them into my computer, so there you go.But if it works!I would highly recommend these buds.Jim HarrisA Bottle of RainNowhere Near the Sea of Cortez"
1,worked well for a month and then one of the earphones stopped working,"the good things- sound is v good, sounds full, good base- you can play your mp3 player on the lowest volume and still hear clearly in the subway, the isolation works pretty wellthe bad- one of the ear phones stopped working after a month, so my set became useless- if you listen to music often or for long, your ears may hurt due to the isolation created by the earphones ... especially while pushing the earphones into your ear or while removing the earphonesi liked the earphones, just wished they had lasted longer!"
2,two pairs in a row broke after about a month!,"i got these earphones for christmas and loved them. they fit great in my ear and had a nice little case to hold them in. they were so amazing at blocking out noise i was shocked. i thought only the big clunky headphones did that, but these did great. but to my disappointment the headphones stopped working in one ear after about two months. i hadn't done anything to damage them. we had another set of the headphones my brother was supposed to get but he didn't want them so i used that brand new pair. this time, they stopped working in one ear after about two weeks!! they would be amazing headphones if they just continued to work. if you get them make sure to keep the package so you can get your money back if they break!"
1,"Work great, until they break","I bought these and they worked great- good sound quality, the 'action' button worked great (although it was a little difficult to press) but within two weeks the left earphone stopped working. I kept them on my desk to use at work (I only listen with one ear) and within a month the right earphone had stopped- after just being sat on my desk.I don't mistreat my earphones- I've since bought the overly-expensive Apple earbuds (Apple In-ear Headphones with Remote & Mic) and they've been going great for two months in the exact same conditions as these earphones were. So I'd have to say to avoid buying these, if my experience is anything to by."
1,I don't understand why people rate this high...,"Where's the bass? Where's the clarity? This thing sounds like I'm in a tincan.Did I get a defective product? There's ""bass,"" but it sounds pasty, and not deep at all.Bleh..."
4,ear phones,"I love the acoustic sound they put out.A convenit traveling case that provides protection.Comfortable ear pieces with three varies sizes to fit ears.Resonable price I think and not to expensive.God bless,"
4,Very good quality and excellent build,They work great with your Sansa. The excellent quailty of the build and great sound will surprise you for the price.
3,"Hey Maximo. More Quality Control...Less Hype, Please!","I'll cut to the chase. It took Amazon shipping me 3 of these before I finally received a pair that ""worked"".1. Plug in fully and EVERYTHING sounded as though some demonic reverb had been applied to the music.2. Missing the extra earplugs though the blister pack was fully closed and had not been previously opened.3. All parts included and no satanic sound effects, however I have to admit that the earphones bundled with my Sansa sound much better than these (and that being despite the fact that I much prefer ear plugs over the bundled type).I thought these would rival the Spark Plugs I purchased a while back, but at approximately 3x the price, they don't. They're serviceable, but that's it. Do yourself a favor. Spend a little more or a lot less."
5,Maximo Sansa Earbud Purchase,"Product arrived brand new, unopened, in perfect condition as promised, at half the price of the retail listings. I ordered two sets with one being for back-up. Great shopping experience."
2,"Good sound quality, crap build quality.","I bought these and was initially very impressed. The housings are solid and constructed of metal and look nice. The sound quality after burn in was rather decent. The lows were very strong and punchy, the mids and highs were acceptable for the price. Sadly, that is where the good news ends. One week later with moderate usage the left channel was dead. I'm guessing it's thanks to the mediocre cable durability and lack of proper cable relief on the connections into the earbuds. Also, the arms that come down from the earbud housings to take the cables in are way too long and get in the way. I tried all the tips and the mediums worked well for me, but if you're looking for headphones that will work while in motion, look elsewhere. They were okay for sitting down at a desk but fall out easily when moving, thanks to the long metal arms that the cables go in to. Pretty disappointed."
2,"sufficient isolation for office settings, mediocre sound quality","Compared to stock iPod phones, these are an improvement, but absolutely nothing compared to ""real"" headphones: Ety er4p, Senn 280, Senn 580, Grado 80 (I own them all).The sound quality is quite mediocre, but I listen to it at such low volumes it hardly matters.At work I don't like sitting with full size phones and the etys, while superb, isolate me too much so these are a nice default.I use it in the office when I need a little bit of isolation from the background noise but not too much isolation so I cannot respond when someone asks me a question.... and they are shiny too.."
2,"Sound decent, then break","I got these off Woot for $18 -- nice price! They sounded reasonable and I used them for about 3 weeks before I realized the left earbud had gone completely dead. Not that surprising; I tend to be pretty rough on my headphones. But I figured I'd try an RMA and got one and they sent a replacement back; it only cost me $2 for the shipping. Figured I'd be gentler and get 3 months or so out of them; so I use them one day traveling to/from work on the subway. Next time I go put them on, I realize the left channel is pretty faint, and I get a phone call so I take them off; I put them back on and the left channel is completely dead. Obviously a bit of a design flaw somewhere in there if they die that quickly."
5,YAY!!!,I just got my Crossing Jordan DVD in the mail! I can't wait to watch it....even if the episodes come on tv all the time.
4,It's interesting!,I have watched this in the past and I've like it. Just wanted to add to my library. This is still part of a medical drama.
5,crossing jordan s-1,"This is one of the best tv series ever made.The cast blends together very well.The writing is great,the leading lady nails her role to a T,as do the others.This is just one of those shows that you want to take the time to watch,it never gets boring.This is a tv series made of quality.These types of shows only come along every now and then."
5,Crossing Jordan equals fabulous!!!,"Crossing Jordan was, and stil is an amazing show. But the thing that made the show really stand out for me was that all the ators were absolutely amazing!!! I also love the fact that all of the actors weren""t drop-dead gorgeous. This fact made the show more relatable to the audience.My favorite characters are Steve Valentine's ""Nigel"" and Ravi Kapoor's ""Bug"". The reason I enjoy them is because they're both so quirky, and different.Another thing I liked was the fact that each actor was give their chance to shine in a particular episode. Miguel Farrer was mesmerizing as Dr. Garett Macy.It also seemed like all the actors really cared about each other. it also seemed like they weren't trying to up-stage one another, they felt like a cohesive group. and that's what made the show a hit.Bring on season 2...I can't wait!!!p.s. i wanna see some bloopers on the next DVD."
1,And again...,"...a show I love that I won't buy on DVD CAUSE THEY CHANGED IT FRICKIN' SOUNDTRACK! it's written on the back ""music may differ from TV version""."
1,horrible writing,It's hard to know which is worse - the writing or the characters. It is not an exageration to say you will groan audibly at the characters interactions and story lines.
5,FINALLY,"I absolutely love this seriesCrossing Jordan: Season 1and I am very glad to hear it is finally coming to DVD, I only hope that the original music from season one is on it. They changed the music after the first season so the show did not have the same irish feel. Can't wait to see the rest of the seasons make it here as well."

5,Magical surprise,"I don't usually write reviews but feel compelled to comment on this ""little picture"". I don't know why I knew nothing of this movie before I took a chance and bought the DVD. It is truly a charming movie that is entertaining for the whole family. Stardust reminds me of one of my all time favorites - - The Princess Bride. The stories are not the same, but the ""feel"" and tone of the movie are similar. My kids watched it with me and were totally pulled into the world. They did get a little scared during the witches scenes, but held on for the rest of the ride.I would highly recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys the Harry Potter series or even moreso for fans of The Princess Bride."
4,A world of magic revealed in Stardust,"A world hidden from the world on our world, where magic has a life of its own and if that magic enters into our world it will become regular everyday items. Filled with stunning visuals, great performances, and filled with humor, action and adventure - this film is great for the whole family. Part Peter Pan, part Macbeth, and all Neil Gaiman enter into the world of Stardust."
4,Robert DeNiro In Drag,"This is a charming family entertainment with a preposterous plot line: witches, magical transformations, and all the rest of the panoply of fairytale lore. What makes it special are the cameo roles from Peter O'Toole, David Kelly, and Ricky Gervaise - and most of all the superb Salty Dog/Drag Queen role for DeNiro which so obviously delights him that it delights the viewer too. This is one of those movies that you watch again and again for the small details, the moments of magic that occur in the interstices of the plot-line which add up to a cumulative pleasure not easily surpassed. If you don't happen to have small children, try to rent a couple for a few hours in order to justify watching this movie at least once."
1,Not Sure...,"I like to think of myself as pretty tech-savvy and I have yet to find a machine that this will play on. DVD player, PC, PS3... Tried it in all of them and it hasn't played in a single one. Just spits it back out without being able to recognize the disc. Ah well, get what you pay for I suppose."
1,Poorly written,"Great actors, not a bad story...but very poorly written, very disappointing. All the women were angry and snarky. Too many immature references about breasts...and a cross dresser pirate, really? It could've been so much more. Even with the beautiful scenery, costumes, good acting and creative flying ship I still give it two thumbs down."
3,Movie in good shape... shipping really slow.,It took a month for the movie to arrive. I had actually forgotten I had ordered it and purchased it in town a week before this one arrived. Great movie.... slow shipping.
5,Charming!,"Wonderful! Charming story, great cast, original concept and flows right along. A fun family movie. de Niro is superb in his role as a pirate - a real change for him, and one he handles well. A good family movie, or something you can curl up and watch together. Highly recommended!"
5,great family entertainment,"great film,picture quality is great and the sound is very good.a film for all the family.a must have addition to your movie collection."
5,A Magical Movie,"I saw this at the theatre and loved it so bought the DVD. Claire Danes, Michelle Pfeiffer and Rober De Niro do a wonderful job of making the characters fun and entertaining. It has all of the ingredients of a fantasy fairy tale that moves with a flow. Excitement, drama, laughter.My kind of movie. And one that the whole family can watch."
5,A modern comedic classic,"Stardust is an imaginative, brilliantly acted and beautifully produced movie about a quest to find a newly fallen star (who in the kingdom of Wall is in the form of a human girl), taken from the sky by a gemstone necklace set on finding the heir to the throne of the kingdom. Now I won't get into too much detail here so those of you who haven't seen it yet can fully enjoy every scene, but let's just say Stardust is not only humorous and surprising in parts, but wonderfully packaged as a whole. The list of amazing actors here only add to the star appeal, and you'll find not a wrong turn in this movie. They've chosen the perfect crop of talent to succeed, and Stardust does succeed--every time. Highly recommended to anyone."
4,great movie,great movie !I was surprised because it didn`t do so good at the box office.It really is a very good movie
5,great,a delightful fantasy and a perfect way to end an evening. Second time I have watched it and will watch again soon.four thumbs up!
3,Okay,"It's a little silly, but not too bad to watch. There's a solid plot and a strong protagonist. The witches are fun to watch."
4,great movie,"very funny, witty. HIghly recommend.Great acting by big names. A real sleeper and well worth your time. Good for the whole family."
5,Watch it again and again,"For anyone who likes the genre to anyone who simply likes the actors, this movie is NOT some cheesy witch/wizard flick with a corny drawn out or redone plot. Along with a great storyline, this adventure takes you through a piece of fantasy that hasn't quite been thought of yet."
5,Stardust is Fabulous!,"Stardust is a fabulously funny and devilish film.I loved all of the characters and the story.And, if for no other reason, see it for Robert DiNiro'sroll."
4,Be patient,Because the wait to get this going is worth the effort. A funny romp. Some very well done special effects. Deniro is worth the price of admission. Older kids will appreciate a fully developed fantasy world and you will have fun.
4,Michelle Pfeiffer should never quit acting!,I absolutely love Michelle Pfeiffer. She has always been a good actress and this movie is the same. Also a great story.
5,very entertaining,"A great movie, never heard of it before searching on amazon prime but it was fun, entertaining and very unpredictable! Stays light-hearted all the way through. Highly recommend it!"
3,Stardust,"I saw this movie when it first came out, but right after I had read the book. At first, I was disappointed because the movie wasn't true to the book. For some reason I wanted to see it again and could not find it anywhere, not even in the library, so I ordered it. After distancing myself from the original book I found this movie enchanting. Good performance from Michelle Pfieffer."
5,Fabulous!,"It is such a shame on how they chose to promote this movie - focusing on Michelle Pfifer's part in the movie. She is not the reason to watch this. Because of the previews I did not want to watch this movie AT ALL. But the hubby wanted to see it. I started out grumpy, with my arms crossed, trying not to enjoy it, but man what a terrific movie. It's basically a fabulous romantic comedy with fantasy-type stuff. and Robert Deniro is great and funny too."
5,Nice,I bought this as a gift for my niece for Christmas and she really enjoyed it. I have seen the movie before and liked it too. Thanks Amazon!
4,"Good Movie, bad captioning","The movie is really great, and this comes from an aficionado of fantasy and science fiction in all formats. However, towards the middle and end, whole lines of text are missing from the closed captions, making it less than desirable for deaf audiences who want to keep up with everything that's going on. I'd rather see less editing because I can read fast enough to keep up, and feel that slower readers should just read what they can, if they are that slow. Works OK for hard of hearing people if wearing amplification to catch the parts that aren't captioned."
5,Ladi Alucard,This is the most awesome movie: If you are looking for a great fantasy wonder ride! Stardust combines all traditional fantasy kingdom plots and breaks all the rules to keep you interested. Try it!
1,Audio Problems,"Watching this on Amazon Prime was a hassle. I had to constantly keep turning down the music which 'Blared' after turning up the sound to hear the dialog, which was barely audible. Is there no standard for these movies? Does amazon ever plan on getting subtitles? This may have helped some."
4,Good movie that deserves more credit.,"I liked this movie. Not really a movie that I would buy but that's OK. It was an interesting idea that the director put together fairly well.The only complaint I have is that the movie was so confusing from the very beginning. In fact, it was so confusing that it distracted from the story line and the plot. The second time I watched it was better for me because I knew what was coming.The thing that made the entire movie was Robert De Niro playing a cross-dressing pirate. It was so out of character for him that you just couldn't help loving him, even with his girly-man thing going on.Well, with all of that said there is just one more thing to say. I would rent it first. Don't buy it so you'll be disappointed and then learn to hate it. It's better to rent it, love it and then buy it, rather than buy it, be disappointed and hate it."
2,Fantasy for adults,"This is a fairy tale with lots of magic and famous actors. It is not a film for children because plot goes in too many directions at times. It is meant to be a British production so even American actors (Claire Danes andMIchelle Pfeifer) have fake british accents that disappear half way through the movie. Robert DeNiro is a complete miscast as a transvestite pirate and he does not even make an attempt to fake his accent.Sorry, but I found this movie to be a drag."
3,Great movie...not so great blu-ray,"All discussion about the movie itself aside, I was disappointed by the quality of this disc. I have the DVD and have been slowly moving my collection of DVD's to Blu-ray versions. When I saw that Stardust had finally hit Blu-ray, I jumped at the chance to get better quality. Unfortunately, though, this Blu-ray doesn't look any better than the upscaled DVD. I fully believe there's some digital slight-of-hand going on here. I suppose you could lay down any type of video on a Blu-ray disc and call it, ""Blu-ray,"" since you're referring to the media not the video. Anyway, this doesn't do 1080P justice. If you're upgrading your movie collection, don't bother with this one. If you've never seen the movie, you should really see it."
5,One of the best fantasy films/love stories ever told!!!,"The title says it all. Great film it has it all, plus you can watch it with the family. I wish we had more amazing original fantasy films like this today."
3,Stardust DVD,"Saw previews of this and thought it would be good. It looked like it fell in the category of movies I like. It was just Ok, not worth buying, unless you can get it cheap. I bought it at a good price, but would have rather just rented it. I liked the main story line, but that was all."
5,Excellent.,"I love this movie because it's fresh, imaginative and presents some new twists in the faerie tale genre. The writing is very very good, the special effects are nicely done, and above all, it's a lot of fun."
5,A really great and under-recognized film,"I really like this movie. It's a quirky fantasy story about a boy on his journey of discovery to become a man. This is a very fun movie to watch. I'd very much liken it to The Princess Bride.There is some violence, so you may want to give it a quick review before allowing children to watch. However, I think in all the content is handled gracefully, and doesn't go over the top just to have done so.The Blu-ray version of this movie is not as high quality as it should be. But still well worth the upgrade from DVD if you have the devices to play it on."
5,They don't make movies like these anymore,"You have to see and own this movie, the cast is phenomenal and the story takes you in and keeps you wondering about what should be and what could be. A must own for adventure seekers, magical enthusist, and hopeless romantics alike.Fall in love with and invest in the characters! It'll be worth it!"
4,"Good For ""Light"" Entertainment","I was in the mood for something light and fun to watch, and found out the title track during the ending credits was ""Rule the World,"" by Take That, which was the clincher for me. Sounds kinda lame, I know, but there you go. Robert de Niro gave a very good performance--a big twist from his usual character roles. All the actors gave good performances. If you want something on the light side, but okay entertainiment, this might do it."
3,Stardust Review,"This movie is pure fantasy. There is absolutely no reason for the pirate captain (Bob De Niro) to be a homosexual. This is inserted into the storyline without adding any value or point. It pushes the militant homosexual agenda upon an (intended) young audience. However, the storyline is a true fairytale. This fun movie has everything—love, romance, pirates, witches, sword-fighting, and ghosts. It’s a hoot. I just get tired of homosexual “statements” being made in various forms of media."
3,Almost,"Being a big fan of the book Stardust by Neil Gaiman I had high expectations for the movie. For the most part it went by the book, but some things were different and did not have to be. The way the story begins in the movie is different than in the book and in fact there is a character who is added and not ever in the book, just a little odd. The movie itself is a fantastic adventure with brilliant effects and a superb story. Like I said though, being a fan of the literature I was just a tad disappointed at parts."
5,Instant Classic,"This movie is yet another epic fantasy for all ages. It is easily on par with titles like ""The Princess Bride"" and ""Labyrinth"". A great story!"
5,Stardust,"For a movie made from a book, this was done quite well. The characters are all cast very very well. The story was changed for the movie, but not so much that fans of the book are instantly dissappointed. It makes sense why they change what they did. I def recommend this film! It is a wonderfully fun story."
5,I loved this movie!,"I've never read the book, so I've no idea how it compares. But this movie positively dazzled me. I found myself sitting here on the edge of my seat biting my nails when it was a tight spot and clapping my hands when I was delighted with how something turned out. If you love magical tales with great characters and romance alongside, please watch this movie! I'm going to try to read the book now. Because surely if I thought the movie was so good, the book must be ten times better!"
5,First buy from tjis seller,Very fast delivery to Belgium. Item corresponds 100% to its description. Will not hesitate to buy again from this seller
2,A Mess,"There's no other way to describe this movie but to call it a mess. There's too many things going on at once--it lacks focus. And then out of nowhere, Robert DeNiro pops into the picture. What a mess."
5,Why we go to the theatres...,"One of the best movies of mine ever. Where do I begin with the good? Its magical, its funny,its suspensful, fun, teary, and a great storyline. Saw it the day it came out with my someone special. Enjoyed it from begenning to end. Michelle Pfeiffer steals the show once more as the evil hideous and magnetic Lamia. Charlie Cox my first movie that I can remember seeing him in, which he did a fantastic job for this role. Claire Danes couldn't have done better. Im beginning to get a soft spot for her in movies, just a wonderful actress. Robert DeNiro, does not mess up here and is as humerous as ever. An incredible narration from Ian and I say we have one hell of a great film that will be loved by for generations. Stardust welcomes you to behold its magic. Coming out December 18th,can't wait."
4,Good service done good,"This was a pleasant buying experience, no hassles, no headaches, and fast smooth delivery of a product in great condition. If you're a sucker for romantic comedies, thrilling adventure, an oft told tale told with an interesting new twist, Star Dust is for you. I saw it three times in theaters, and now have seen it a like number of times in the weeks following its purchase. Casting is spot on, no false notes for any of the actors selected for any of the roles. This includes even the smallest speaking part. So buy it rent it and enjoy a couple of hours with friends you hadn't known you had."
5,A must have!,I have been reading fantasy for as long as can remember and I have seen some great works get destroyed when they hit the silver screen. Not this time. Stardust was so much fun I advanced ordered a few copies for friends for the holidays. I will put this DVD on my shelf next to Legend and The Fellowship of the Ring as one of the best fantasy movies in my collection. It is not the same as the book and nothing can compete with Gaiman and the art of the Vess man but I would say that they gave me what I wanted most from the film and a few extra things too. I would love an extended version of this thing.
5,great movie!,I loved the movie! I am not a fantasy movie or book person at all but found the story very sweet and funny. I definitely wouldn't suggest it for anyone under 13. There were some parts that were very intense but not graphic...per se.
5,wow,"I'm not a fantasy movie fan but watching this one changed my whole concept.It's a great movie, great story telling :D"
5,"Great price, product just as described.",Thank you for the opportunity to add this great movie to my collection at such a wonderful price. Shipping was fast and product was just as described. Thanks again.
5,Worth it for DeNiro alone!,"I can't add very much to all the other raves given to this delightful film, but I will echo what others have said -- it has it all!It's got romance ... adventure ... action ... special effects ... and DeNiro doing the absolutely most hilarious bit in recent movie history!The only small thing I could possible find fault with is simply the absence of SDHI (subtitles for the deaf and hearing impaired).If you are hard of hearing, you can't get closed captioning on a high def tv and the regular English subtitles are those big fuzzy yellow letters that are distracting. So, you either have to strain to hear or read horrid lettering. But that is a fault in almost all newer DVDs, so it's not specific to this movie."
4,Excellent Movie,"Many people balk at or are harsher critics of movies based on books. The usual rule is that books are better than the movie. If that's the case here, and I haven't read the book yet so I can't say for certain, then the book must be outstanding indeed! The movie has a playful, yet serious air about it that works very well. De Niro and Pfeiffer are in high form for this movie and Cox and Daines really do a wonderful job of making me believe the characters! Strong does an excellent job with Septimus, although there are times when the dialogue written for Septimus could have been more fluid."
3,Cute movie,"Stardust is cute, fun, and imaginative. It was a little boring at times, but over-all, I enjoyed watching it."
4,Funny!,This movie was very funny; I don't know why it didnt get better reviews. Maybe I liked it because I like the whole fantasy genre.
4,Feel good fantasy movie,I'm not going to go into great depth with this review. This is the type of movie (for me) that does not get old. It has a very standard plot line that works and flows from start to finish.It's the type of movie I will put on to make me feel better when I'm in somewhat of a down mood.
4,Delightfullly magical,"Thoroughly enjoyed Stardust. Saw it twice before I bought it. Both grandaughters (ages 8 and 14) said it was their favorite movie of the year. Pfeffer, DeNiro, Danes, and Cox did a fabulous job in their roles. A truly wonderful magical adventure. Some very funny parts as well.Stardust (Full Screen Edition)"
4,A very cute and endearing film,"I was enchanted with this film. It is quite original, I thought and I loved the multitude of different characters, all interesting in their own way. And who didn't find Tristan utterly adorable and charming? He made this film. For all fantasy/romance lovers, this is a perfect film for you. Though I am still confused as to why Robert De Niro has a huge image of himself on hte poster and dvd and the actor who playes Tristan doesn't even has name on it whatsoever. I was a bit miffed at that because he is the main character while De Niro is barely even in the film. But anyway, this is a refreshing new type of fantasy that will surely appeal to all ages. Also, the blooper reel has some real funny stuff on it."
3,StarDust,"The story line was that of fantasy, and the intertwined lines of the sons vying for the thrown added the necessary humor that made portions of the movie enjoyable rather than boring.My one reason for the 3 rating rather than a 4 or 5 was the unneeded addition of the gay captain. It was almost as if Hollywood was trying to instill some agenda into the picture which I found pathetic and unnecessary. Especially on a film that Children would watch."
3,"Great Idea, Poorly Cast.","Stardust was someone's great idea for movie fantasy with lots of high tech special effects and a wonderful story line. Unfortunately ""someone"" had a ""casting agenda"".The fallen star heroine is played by the less-than-attractive Claire Danes while a ""totally beautiful Sienna Miller"" is completely mis-cast as the bithchy stuck-up girl friend. Likewise, Charlie Cox isn't really ""leading man material"" but ""someone"" seems determined to make the viewer buy it. Robert DeNiro is ""awful"" as the ""closet gay pirate captain"" (The ""only"" movie I've ever ""not"" liked DeNiro in).What a waste. This could have been a ""classic"" fanstasy movie. Now it's just a flagrant nepotistic showcase for the power of Hollywood ""insiders' vain promotion"" of their relatives and family members. They'd be more believable as an industry if they just released their ""backyard home movies""."
2,I was very disappointed,"i was very disappointed. this was a movie i was looking forward to seeing, but apparantly the previews are the only good parts. considering also the number of popular stars that were a part of this movie, it bombed. Especially since it is supposed to be for family, it was gruesome, with sexual suggestions all the way through it. the computer graphics were very well done, that is all that i have to say about it that is good. pj"
3,It has its moments,"It has some funny and fairy-like scenes. The are two disappointments. First, I don't see or feel the love between the 2 main characters. Second, overall, it does not feel like a fairy tale. It's more like a light comedy.It's worth renting."
3,Botox for Miss Pfeiffer please!,"Vaughn's ambitious fantasy is something of a curate's egg. It certainly looks good, with some impressive, if uneven, special effects and an attractive, stellar cast. It will undoubtedly enchant most children and keep them entertained throughout. For me, however, it was marred by several fundamental flaws. There's some very clunky dialogue, and, in their (laudable) efforts to appeal to both kids and adults, Vaughn and Goldman have allowed themselves to indulge in some painfully laboured humour. There's also a somewhat contrived, forced feeling to the way the story progresses. This may sound like mean-spirited criticism but these problems result in a movie that has much less heart and charm than it ought to have. This is far from being a bad movie, but, with an improved script, it could have been a much better one."
