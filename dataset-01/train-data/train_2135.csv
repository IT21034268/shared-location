2,NOT plus size for an adult,"I ordered this plus size costume for my boyfriend who is average, 5-11 200lbs. I ordered plus.size bc all the reviews written for one size fits all said the costume was made small. I had high hopes for this one. My man cant even.get it on. For comparison, I put it on. Im tiny. 5'3 110lbs n it FITS. I have no.growing room in it. It states for jacket sizes 46-52. False advertisement!!! I gave it 2 stars only bc its a sweet.costume for the price. Its not for an adult tho. Were not returning it bc our 9yr olds gonna wear it instead."
2,Double impact,"I enjoyed Tess Gerritson's book, but was not impressed with Debra Webb's book...too Hallequin Romance for my liking. Not one of Tess Gerritson's best work. I like her medical mysteries much more!"
2,The Puttermesser Papers,"First, I cannot believe that this book is a finalist for a National Book Award. I have usually agreed with all their choices, but I was surprised at this one. It's not just the negativity and self absorption of the character herself and the story that was at issue here for me, but I never cared for Ruth Puttermesser as a person. It seemed to me (excepting her violent end of course) that she deserved everything she got. Seemingly, she is a strong character with all of her intellect and education, but she does nothing with them. She lives in squalor, complains about everything, and does nothing to lift herself out of those surroundings. Some losers you come to like or accept, but with Ruth Puttermesser I did not even feel a twitch of sympathy. It is obvious that the author is very intelligent herself and well read; however, all that does not necessarily make for an interesting book."
1,Read something else,"This book represents one of modern, unnecessary, and vague works of our time. I would never read it, if it wasn't for my class."
5,extremely thought provoking but depressing,"Whether autobiographical, biographical, or fiction the author conveys her various philosophies and beliefs in an entertaining and educational way. Definitely not designed for pure entertainment. My conclusion after summing up all the chapters is that we have a cynical woman who was damaged emotionally by the rejection of Emil Hauchvogel. Not for the light of heart"
3,Andrew Baltazar reveiw,"The book ""local news"": collection of stories,"" By Gary Soto was a very interesting book the story is like a Mexican language, but also English book.The background is about a young family who argues and shared some love. The theme of the story takes place in the house, park, and different holidays. The biggest problem was that the two sons were always fighting and most of the time they did get along.When you read every chapter of ""local news"" you will imagine pictures about the book.If you love reading on family and adventure you will enjoy every chapter."
5,All Hail Lovepie!,"I was always told that God rested on the seventh day- but now I know that on the seventh day God created Nini Camps. This is not only a great debute, it's a great album (when was the last time you could say that?). ""Rain"" is beatiuful, as is ""Take Me Down Easy"" and the untitled bonus track, while ""I Thought I Knew You"" and ""Thoughts Of You"" rock. This CD has taken up permanent residence on my CD player. Consider me hooked."
4,Simply the best,"Her voice, her soul, her heart...pick up the album and find forgotten feelings brought back to life, a smile will creep across your lips...Nini Camps will give you the pleasure of good feelings, the pleasure of life in your veins."
5,Very useful book for any self study program.,"Very clear and concise. Great info and well laid out. I am a big fan of the Pimsleur Programs, and this was a great supplement along with some others to add to the self study program I was following."
1,Do not buy!!!!,"I purchased this toy for my son for Christmas. What a disappointment!! First of all, I could not get the film loaded. Once I got it loaded, it would not take pictures! I really wish I saw the other reviews before I bought it. Since it was purchased on line and the package is destroyed from opening it, I won't be able to return it. What a shame, Little Tikes usually makes such good toys!"
1,NOT FOR CHILDREN WHO CANNOT FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS,"I purchased this toy for my 5 year old because his sister had a similar item at the age of 3 1/2. This camera DOES NOT COME with a lock on the film loading mechanism. Brett ""just wanted to see what that button did"" and popped open the case exposing the film & destroying all of the pictures he took of his cousins over the holidays. I am currently looking for an item similar to the fisher price model that has a parent only loading & rewind feature."
1,What a disappointment!,"I purchased 18 cameras for a company children's Christmas party. All 18 are being returned. They all had problems with the film either catching or rewinding. If the camera worked, it took one photo and stopped working all together. I'm terribly disappointed in this Little Tikes product. I've purchased Little Tikes for 20 years and never have I had a problem."
1,Stay away from this piece of JUNK!,Bought this for Christmas for my 8 year old. Took one picture and the film would not stop at the next advancement stage and the shutter would not even snap. I Will be taking this back to Toys-R-Us. this is the most worthless piece of crap I have ever seen. It is cheaply built and you have to take out two tiny screws just to replace the battery. Don't waste your money or another roll of film trying to make it work like I did. I thouht Little Tikes made durable stuff for kids. Not stuff that Breaks or don't even work at all.
1,Piece of junk!!!,"Biggest rip off ever!!! The camera took one picture and the film wouldn't advance, tried another roll just to make sure...no luck!!No matter what we tried it just wouldn't work. If you enjoy seeing the face of a disappointed child on Christmas morning, buy this camera!"
1,THE WORST EVER,Certainly NOT bold and certainly DO NOT ERASE?!?!? What's the point in dry erase markers that take nail polish remover to remove and STILL leave faint shadows or marking. Bought these for a kids dry erase table... VERY DISAPPOINTED. Wouldn't let me leave 0 stars... 1 star is generous.
4,History Book,"I recieved the item locally from the seller, they did not offer to refund or my shipping charges that I paid even though there ws no shipping involved.. thats ok though I got a great price on the book and the shipping did not offset that."
5,gentle gem of a book,"Elias Gewurtz published The Hidden Treasures of the Ancient Qabalah in 1918. He wrote the book from Krotona California. Gewurz opens the door to the spiritual senses with such gentleness and light. This book was handed to me by a friend who found it in an old book store in Biloxi, Mississippi. Every day there is something new and meaninful to read and ponder. Reaching out from the past and handing down the loving traditons of his teachers before him, Gewertz has left breadcrumbs, little hints and a twinkling encouragement for those of us who have stumbled upon his path......."
1,to say it a word: boring!,"Armand is my favourite vampire, I adore him, I like Anne Rice, but...yeaaahhhh, this book is so dull, so boring, it even seems too long, THIS CAN'T BE THE ARMAND I LOVE, it's ...oh, it seems to never end, and all the time when you as a reader pictured Marius as a great vampire, he was horrible, how could Armand love him? Evil, evil guy! Hard to read."
1,Boring one!,"I am a Chinese. And I'm a Anne Rice fan.I like Vampire Chronicles so much. But this ends up in The Vampire Armand.This book makes me tired, asleep. It entirely lacks interesting points. All the sick sex, meaningless emotions, really make me tired. And Marius and Armand, the couple of lovers, their love history had been mentioned in other books so many times, that makes me exhausted, too.The Vampire Armand is a disappointed one."
2,Same old drivel,All the Vampire Armand is is homoerotica. She should have published it under her pen name Rocquelaire. Not that there is anything wrong with homoerotica but what has happened to Anne Rice's character development and pacing? Let's all read Interview with the Vampire and The Witching Hour again to reminisce about the previous brilliant work of a master.
1,Back to the library within 48 hours!,"Maybe it was just too 180 from my latest summer reading selection (Midwives), but this book just bothered me. I have a shelf of Rice books; I've done the standing-in-line, book-signing thing. I've even walked by her house in New Orleans, proof positive of a devoted fan. But ""Armand""... I felt embarrassed reading it, for myself, and for Ms. Rice. I dumped it into the drop box at my local library, unfinished. All I could think of was Lestat, on horseback, racing away from the wolves. Now THAT was a story."
1,I would rather eat shards of glass then read this again,"When Anne Rice wrote ""Interview with the Vampire"" she was at the top of the slide. She has now just about hit bottom and is approaching the sand. Slow start, slow middle, and pointless end. I will buy one more AR book from this series. If reading it is like staring into the sun with a telescope I am through with her. Let her author Christmas cards..."
2,"Have a long rest, Anne","Very disappointing. I can hardly believe that this author is the same person who wrote 'Interview with the vampire', 'The Vampire Lestat' & 'Queen of the damned'. I am not a prude, but I was extremely offfended by some of the subject matter - is Anne advocating child molesting? At a time when pedophilia is responsible for destroying thousands of young lives, I believe that it is very wrong to seemingly approve of such an abomination, whether the molestor is a vampire or not. Besides this, the descriptions were interesting, if a bit dragged-out. And there were many anomalies - now Armand didn't order Claudia's death? I am glad I didn't pay for this book (it was loaned to me). I would consider it money down the drain (or sewer perhaps). Such a letdown, after the first 3 vampire books & 'The Witching hour'."
2,None,"Thoughtful and immersive, like all of Rice's work, but the constantly in-your-face pedophilia theme is pretty distracting. I think she could have told her story without all the man-on-boy filatio."
2,The Vampire Armand,"The Vampire Armand tells the story of the mysterious Armand of Theatre des Vampires fame in Interview with the Vampire. From his boyhood in Russia, to becoming Marius' apprentice, up to the present where Armand is telling his story to David Talbot, we are taken on a journey through his life.Unfortunately, this journey is more reminiscent of a trip to the grocery store rather than the intended exciting journey of Armand's life. I found myself unable to relate to Armand and didn't really care what happened to him, since I had already thought him dead at the end of Memnoch the Devil. As usual, Anne Rice's imagery and descriptiveness are excellent as she shows the luxury of Venice, and the cold, hard Russian steppes, but I found myself trying to read this as quickly as possible just so it could be over and I could move on. Hopefully, Merrick will be more enjoyable."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Thankfully, the Vampire Armand is somewhat a return to form after the terrible previous book. Armand has been seriously injured by the sun at the end of the previous novel, and is stuck, unable to move while he recovers.An ideal device to delve into his back story, his discovery by Marius, their love of art.Armand, while recovering, uses his abilities to get two children to bring him a drug dealer, so he can do the bloodsucking thing to restore some strength. He takes the two kids as proteges, much as Marius did for him, and eventually Marius turns them into vampires, provoking some argument."
2,Ew.,"Now I loved interview with the vampre. I thought Queen Of the Damned was good, too. PAndora was okay. But this was nasty. Anne Rice's works are steadily decreasing in originality,and suspense. The Vampire Armand is just a Testament to this. It fails to involve you, and when it does its because a young *boy* as had oral sex performed on him by a vampire. I had to re-read that part a couple of times to make sure I was not making a false judgement. Don't read this peice of trite, it is a far cry from Ms. Rice's older books."
3,Agree with 'ego needs editor' reviewer,"I'm currently re-reading 'Interview With a Vampire'...the book that blew my mind and still makes today's Vampire-mania seem lightweight. 'the Vampire Lestat' is also rich...deep...steaming, a complex and triumphant mix of poetic prose that ferries you to the depths of hell but with a wry guide and passionate relentless search for meaning in an absurd and self-contradictory world.As the series continued I found the books went so far into the author's esoteric pov I was unable to...sink my teeth in and be nourished. It was a great let-down.I'm happy I read the early books when I did. I have faith the author will write better books. Perhaps she's malnourished: grubbing for rat blood.If it would help I'd offer her a schlurp from my wrist. Come back to us...we are starving from the insipid vampire books and tv shows spewing out from unripe writers."
1,Homosexual pornography is not literature.,"I have been a faithful follower of all things written by Anne Rice. Whether I liked the genre or no, I have still given a chance to everything she's written. However, I draw the line at reading about a young child having sex with a long dead middle-aged looking vampire. Not even halfway through I had to put it down and distract myself from it so I wouldn't throw up. I find it foul and disgusting that Rice can no longer write a story without two men ""bonding"" every five pages. If she feels this need, she should continue the Beauty series again and leave vampires in the world of blood, not demented carnal pleasures."
4,Blabbering,"Oh my god. I love you Jamie from Sacramento and Yuki Shinobu.I do!You took the words right out of my mouth. Well, I'm still a teenager but I think I'm mature enough not be disgusted...because I loved that book. Well, there _were_ some parts that didn't interest me so much - well, I don't really believe in God that much - but hey, it's Armand we're talking about!!! And I love Marius and especially Armand, c'mon, he's beautiful, brilliant and tragic.You shouldn't read the book and then call it names...I would like YOU to write a book like that. It's not that easy, you know.Well..I'm just blabbering again. Now I'll stop it."
3,"Anne, Have you been kidnapped by hollywood","I loved the first four Vampire books. But the last three were not that great. These 3 were depressing to say the least.I was disappointed in the Vampire Armand. I dont mind the gay/bi stuff but I did mind the experiments with Claudia. That bothered me. I also found Benji and Sybelle as dull and non dimensional characters. I found myself thinking that I want the Old Anne Rice back, not someone kidnapped by hollywood. I hope that the next vampire book she writes will resurrect Lestat, and continue the relationship between Louis and Lestat. Anne stop vacillating about religion, some people read books to take their minds off the state of the world. I know that I certainly do."
3,Somehow you keep on feeling to slap Armand!,"Armand is possibly Rice's most wishy washy vampire to date. He never thinks for himself and ends up being unhappy with the results. As for the quality of the story, Rice is back in form. A good tale, but a weak central character."
4,Another enjoyable book!,"This was a good read as well as all of the others in the Vampire series. Anne Rice once again makes one envision the characters and their surroundings. Her attention to detail is impressive as always. I'll never bore of the series. Although I must say that ""The Witching Hour"" and others in the Lasher series have made a long lasting impression and I'll re-read them time and time again. Thanks Anne for letting us be there with you."
3,Armand seems very dull at times.,"I did enjoy the book but i did not fall in love with Armand like i did with LeStat and Louis. All alone, i found him lifeless at times & boring. The main thing that kept me going through the book was the ? of what was wrong with LeStat (i couldn't remember what had happened to him) and what the outcome would be. Armand is a interesting vampire, but he needs to be a bit more mature. I got the impression that he was still a teenager even after all those years. Lost & wondering what to do."
1,Recycle Bin,"Don't waste your time on this one. Anne Rice has succeeded in draining the life out of her once-lush characters. She concentrates on child molestation for the first half of the book, which is not only offensive, but adds nothing to the story. The only thing horrifying here is her writing."
5,I loved it,"I thought that this would be just boring scence we already knew about the vampire armond from the vampire lestat but I was wrong. this book tells all, about the vampire armond I loved it."
4,Another good one from Anne Rice! I love the Vampire Chronicles! Especially our bad boy Lestat . This story is,"This story is about a young boy who Marius falls in love with and has to decide whether to do the ""Dark Trick"" or not."
3,"Thematically confused, but entertaining","The 'autobiography' of the Vampire Armand, from his birth in Kiev Rus up to and including the events of Memnoch the Devil.While Armand's life and history were interesting, and something I've been curious about since I read Interview with the Vampire, I was not entertained by the theological discourses Rice has seen fit to engage her characters in more and more frequently in the last couple Vampire Chronicles. Also, an odd juxtaposition, a lot of the description of Armand's sexual relationships with Marius, Bianca, and others. Overall, it was okay, and I suppose essential to the series."
3,The Vampire Armand,"I always feel two things when I finish a Chronicle. Fear of the dark from the creatures these vampires run into, and depression, because I never want the story to end. Rice makes them more than species, she makes them Gods."
1,Simply awful,"One quickly gets bogged down in this latest installment of her vampire series. There is more vampire ""angst"" in this novel than in all of Ms. Rice's other books. Ms. Rice seems to get carried away with her descriptions of landscape and cathederals while the plot plods on endlessly. The next installment of this series, which I will most assuredly get at the local library, needs to have more action and less ""poor me"" yak."
1,Yawn...,"I've read EVERYTHING (except Violin & Pandora) that Anne Rice has written. This was at the bottom of the barrel for her. As a novel in general, It didn't go anywhere, and in the process offered little or nothing new."
1,Bad Book,"This book was a disappointment. Couldn't help feeling Ms. Rice had a deadline to meet. I found little character develpment, even less exploration of the ""world of vampires"" Anne Rice created with such richness with her previous Chronicles...I found the (seemingly) preoccupation with homosexual sex both mechanically written and generally uninterestingly, adding nothing but ""filler"".After the richness of ""Pandora,"" this was one paultry sequel...Morgan"
2,A massively problematic work,"Through most of this novel, I figured on my review being two stars. It wasn't abysmally bad, but rather failed to justify its own existence - it didn't tell anything worth saying. Rice fails to find an original or compelling voice for Armand, and the plot is largely dull repitition of what we learned in The Vampire Lestat. It was the Claudia sequence which initially made me go down to one star. It was stupid, pointless, and incredibly ill-advised. It warps out of nowhere, unwelcome, and leaves without even being satisfying! What was Rice thinking? That he readers wanted to learn that garbage? The ending third of the book, although Sybelle and Benji are dull characters, was better handled since it provided Armand an interesting dilemma, so it's two stars overall. But still, a great disappointment."
2,"A beautifully written book, but...where's the story?","Is it me, or is there no story? Some other reviewers have said it's flat, and I found it to be exactly that. Others have said the inaccuracies drove them nuts; I swallowed them and gave them up to poetic license. The sex I could deal with. The Frankenstein experiment I could not. I eventually started reading this as a poem, and found myself enjoying the beauty of the language, as opposed to looking for a story. The ending made me throw the book down in frustration, and the word ""hack"" came to mind. I'm sick to death with the continuous ""love or lack thereof"" theme that these creatures keep searching for. Again, it's pretty prose, and that's about all."
2,The magic is gone,"I just finished reading ""The Vampire Armand"" and I find myself asking the same question I've asked at the end of the last three or four Anne Rice books. That question is, ""What has happened to quality of Anne Rice's books."" I've read all of her books to date and enjoyed many of her early Vampire novels. However, the most recent ones have just been bad. Sure, they are light reading. You can finish them in about six hours. They all have bright moments. But are they satisfying? No. Perhaps she is turning them out too fast. Whatever the case, ""The Vampire Armand"" is light years away from ""Interview with a Vampire"" or ""The Witching Hour""."
2,Waste your money on other things,"Well, *I* have read most of Anne's books and Hello, this is a place to write *reviews*, if you haven't read it, who are you to give an opinion? How is what you write here helpful when you didn't even read it yet?Well, my opinion is this: up to the day I almost finished the book I was still worrying about waiting for Anne's future books. Well, after I finished it, I don't care if Anne writes another book or another word. One of my fav characters is Mona and Belinda, so I don't have any problem with the sex. My main problem is who are these characters? Does Anne even know them anymore? I don't want to give spoilers but I didn't even care about the ending where you know what happens....Anne, my fav books are still The Queen of the Damned and The Witching Hour and it will always will be, thanks for those. But since Memnoch, it has been way disappointing.... I doubt I will read another Anne Rice book...."
2,Well...it had lots of promise but it didn't deliver,"I just read all the Amazon on-line reviews and was surpised to see the extremes in opinions. I own all of Anne Rices' novels and I eagerly await each new one. I expected to ""fall into"" this novel as I have with so many of her other novels. But, unfortunately, I found myself skimming to see what would happen next rather than savoring the prose and plot development. I agree with other reviewers that characters were ""out of character"" and what was going on with Lestat?????!!!!"
1,A waste of time,"This book is childish nonsense. Not only does it have no meaning, but it is boring. Save your time and money for something worthwhile."
2,"Too descriptive, poor narrator","I didn't enjoy this book on tape. There was too little action and interaction among the characters. In this book Rice describes everything in excruciating, unnecessary, and unending detail. Jonathan Marosz was a poor choice of narrator. Different character's voices were sometimes hard to distinguish. He just didn't bring them to life as others have (Frank Muller)."
2,The worst of the Vampire Chronicles. No more Vampire please.,It has a good start but it became very dragging. Her reason as to how Armand survive was not even convincing. I think it is obvious that Anne Rice has run out of plots to tell about the Vampire Chronicles.
2,Will the Real Anne Rice Please Start Writing?,"What was that? It bore no resemblance to the first four Vampire Chronicles, and was bogged down in Ms. Rice's obvious struggles with her Catholic upbringing. Spare us. Since ""Memnoch,"" a thoroughly loathesome tale, Ms. Rice has forgotten how to tell a story and spends too much time indulging herself at the expense of her characters. What were once richly-drawn characters full of lively interest, are now whiny, wandering, bores.I'm not reading another of her novels until she returns Lestat to himself. What did he ever do to her to deserve such treatment?"
2,Mediocre...very disappointed.,There was too much reference to the other books. I prefer to relate to the other books and characters on my own. To read the words 'if you read...' in relationship to a previous book is extremely annoying.
3,Not an Immortal,"The Vampire Armand was in total a decent book, but it was by far not one of Anne Rices masterpieces. Though she continues weaving fact with her fiction she failed to capture the alluringness that her other vampires share. When reading the novel I was always waiting for the action to pick up but much to my dismay it never did. For loyal Anne Rice fans the novel is a must read though it won't be one they most remember or enjoy. For new readers hoping to tap into the magic that others have discovered they should NOT begin with this book. In the end readers will find themselves thirsting for another book to satisfy their bloodlust."
3,I am glad I checked it out of the library first,"I just finished TVA. The beginning was very slow going, and it wasn't until a third of the way through that Amadeo became Armand, the Vampire. I wish that instead of writing a biography of each Vampire, she would write more books about our beloved coven as a whole. Pandora was a very good biography, but poor David's character...he is turning into such a boring character -and he has such promise as a vampire with real depth and intelligence. Armand just didn't do it for me, but I can't tell if it was Ms. Rice's overabundant prose, or if she just didn't write the story deeply enough."
2,disappointment,This book is a waste of time. I think the first 5 were complete and interesting tales. Armand is not himself and the homosexuality is a little too much for me handle this time around. One of the most interesting characters Anne Rice created turns out to be a disappointment.
4,Beautyful return to her best Charachters...,"I've read all the books from Anne Rice, and this one has a wonderful way of taking us back to the Vampire Chronicles' magic, It was needed for all of us(Rice's fans) to keep on knowing about this Charachters she made us once love, specially about Armand we couldn't have more than a superficial sight...it was perfect to have the chance to really ""know"" him with this book...But I find that it needed more from her heart.....it gets too cold in more than one part..that's why I give it 4 stars Anyway I hope we can have more news about this Charachters as soon as possible, I already miss them...Thanks Anne,"
3,undead biography,"I love Annes works but I found this story to be rather empty. She tries to fill Armand with life and innocence which he lost under the tutelage of Marius. I am not convinced. I found that the origans of this character did not match the Armand we read about now. I was dissapointed with the story, I hate to say it but true."
4,Very descripive and entrancing,"If you liked the rest of the vampire chronicals then you willlove this book. And for those who haven't read anything by Anne Rice Isuggest to pick it up right away. It's descriptive and enthralling, once you have started you will feel bad for putting it down and not finishing it."
5,Immensly Satisfying!!,"After painstakingly finishing ""Memnoch the Devil"" I had started to loose faith in Anne. The Vampire Chronicles are my all time favorite. I don't just love them, I ADORE them. I found ""Memnoch"" to be so drawn out and lacking in excitement, I had to force myself to finish it. Then when I saw ""The Vampire Armand"" my hope grew anew. Not only did it live up to my expectations it exceeded them. It was exactly what I needed from her. Armand is so incredibly sexy in this book every woman and man will dream of being with him, I know I did. Reading this was like ""hot cocoa on a warm winters night"". It really hit the spot. It also gave me an appreciation for ""Memnoch"", without it some of the best content of ""Armand"" would not exist. The ending was PERFECT. I walked away daydreaming about it for weeks. Now I can't wait to read ""Pandora"" and ""Vittorio"", the only 2 I havn't read. Thank you, Anne, for restoring my faith in you and giving us back our beloved vampires."
2,It was ok.,"I have hoped beyond hope that Anne Rice would return to herpast glory-but after reading this latest, I think I will head for thelibrary instead of the bookstore for her next.Some severe historical inaccuracies are really distracting. This combined with some uncomfortable pedophilia and some horrendous character about faces have me seriously doubting if I will believe what will happen next in this tale. And the problem is that it keeps repeating itself, and I still won't believe it."
2,the blood is running thin,"Alas, the recycling of a clutch of familiar characters, settings, and sexualsituations does not a novel make. But the series has longsince lost its oomph,in this reader's opinion, and only those motivated by nostalgia for previousthrills will find this book a rewarding read. Too bad; there's an awful lot ofjunk out there with ""vampire"" in the title, but once upon a time this authorproduced novels about the breed that were bombshells of strong writing andemotional effect."
5,Hmmm,"Seems to me that there is a clear correlation between all the prudes who hate the homosexual dewscriptions in the book and those who give it 1 star or less. This book is not about sex! Ive read it in a record time (5 days) and noway do i remember it for any allegedly paedophilic and sexual content (nonsense). Its a book about a human soul who is struggling to find peace between his immortal existence and his innate goodness and faith. The descriptions were excellent the plot was emotional and cataclysmic in its proportions, we see the changing stages in poor haunted armand from childhood innocence through the desolation of the 17th and 18th centuries and finally to attempted suicicde and rebirth in his love for his two new companions sybelle and benji. In short it sees what is perjaps the most human of all vampires struggle with his relationship with god and other vampires. A very entertaining and meaningful book, Rice more books like this please!"
2,"If your into gay porn, don't skip the first half!","Having read several of Rice's Vampire Chronicles, I found myself re-evaluating the entire series after finishing THE VAMPIRE ARAMAND. The two main vampires, or rather ""vamps"" in this case, have been reduced to nothing more than a couple of sniveling fops! Having bathed in the lake of immortality seems to have produced a ravenous appetite for nothing more than rabid homosexual lust, sacchrine laced proclamations of love and commitment, and fawning over the latest fashions. Marius and Armand, former icons and pillars of strength within the 'chronicles, have been transformed into a pair of Harliquin Romance candymen. Once beyond the vacuous relationship of these immortal lovers, Rice regains some of the pacing that made her other works classics. Unfortuneately, the nose dive is recovered too late."
2,"Too much atmosphere, not eneough plot","Rice's latest installment in the Vampire Chronicles is long on atmosphere, but short on plot. She is great at setting moods (I've always thought that reading Rice is a little like being on drugs), and describing historical settings, but she needs to get back to some good old fashioned storytelling! Although this book fleshes out Armand's already known story, its only real storyline is what happened to him after his apparent immolation after viewing Veronica's Veil. This plot could be summarized in a sentence or two. The storylines of two of her recent books, ""Memnoch the Devil"", and ""Servant of the Bones"" are much more compelling."
1,I couldn't even finish it!,"I have been a long time Rice fan and am appalled at this book. I tried for almost four months to trudge through it. I agree with the ""gay porn"" reviewer. Sad-sad!! I hope Vittorio is better."
1,The aboslute pitts - I rate this book ZERO STAR,"I finished this book last night (2/10) thank goodness it is over. She ruined Marius - she ruined everything - i have always enjoyed the AR poetic style, her historic descriptions but this book was just the pitts - i thought violin was a fluke - now we can add armand - it was just alful I have read every book she has published - now there are 2 i thought were alful - i hope she shakes this whatever it is."
2,I don't think Armand can carry his own novel,"Not Rice's par at all. The spark and sensuality evident in the other Vampire books just isn't as present. The sexual, visceral descriptions illuminated the behaviors of previous Rice vampires. It's stale in this book and Armand is just a really flaccid character here. The androgynous boylike nature that made him so fascinating in ""Interview"" just makes him seem weak in ""Armand."""
1,Armand is a BORE! First Violin...now this,"Rice has got to get her wits about her - she makes no sense these days - there was nothing seductive about this book - i thought it nothing more than smut and gore - nothing magical about ARMAND. I'm exactly 1/2 way through and can't wait until it's over - Come on Ms. Rice, you did PANDORA in between these two ugly beast - you can give us better than that."
1,SHE RUINED ARMAND AND MARIUS!,"I can't see how ANYONE liked this book! I love Anne's earlier works - Interview and Lestat still rank as two of my all time favorites. But she RUINED both Armand and Marius! Both were strong, unique, and interesting characters in past books. Now they will forever be sniveling, weak, and supid, all because of this book! Anne's writing style was not flowery or insightful (Not like Memnoch, which WAS enthralling) - it was monotonous and boring. That alone would be enough to pan the book. But what she did to Marius and Armand is UNFORGIVABLE!!DO YOURSELF A FAVOR - DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!!"
5,Wounderful,If you liked the character in the previos novels you will love this book. His life unfolds befor you.From slayery to Godhood to a demon and finaly to the vampire we all love. One of the most well written books to date.
4,GREAT!!,"Actually , I haven't read Anne Rice's work before. Only watched ""INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE"" on the film long long time ago and I really love it. This one, The Vampire Armand , is the first for me. It touched my heart and made me want to find her old works in The Vampire Cronicles. If you love The Vampire Stories , you must read this one!!"
1,Was this really written by Anne Rice?,"I am a long-time Anne Rice fan and was delighted, if slightly confused, to find brand-spanking new copies of ""Armand"" in the clearance stacks of the 1/2 price bookstore. Having read the first half of the book I am suspect; the book is so poor, and the dialogue so awkward and cloying, that I truly can't believe that this was really written by Anne Rice herself. Perhaps ghostwritten? It doesn't seem possible that the same woman who wove such detailed, succulent tapestries of words in the other VC books could have produced this Harlequin romance-level bilge. Disappointing."
5,The best of Anne Rice's books,I think that The Vampire Armand was a great book. it is lot better than the other books. I think that I didn't like was the fact that Armand is homosexual. I don't like that about him.Other than that I thought that it was good. The thing that I didn't get because I didn't read any other Anne Rice's books at the time was the time line. I had no idea why Lestat was in a comma and didn't know when it happened in the story.I like the fact that it was an adult story.
1,Anne Rices worst ever,Having finished Memnoch I waited with anticipation for another great story by Ms. Rice. Sorrowfully Anne rice doesn't seem to be as hungry as when she wrote the Witch Chronicles or the beginning of the Vampire series. The Vampire Armand could be compared to hospital food. I doubt I will ever buy another Anne Rice book. Her fans needed a good read after Servant of The Bones which started out well enough and then slowly lost its intrigue til it fell into the abyss and I for one was glad to get to the last page and end the pain.
1,A Bad Sample of Anne Rice's Work,"I agree with the majority of the other reviewers. I have tried to read this book twice, and have never gotten more than half way through it. I found Anne Rice's book very engaging, but I was seriously disappointed with this book. I chose not to purchase her latest book, because I found the Vampire Armand so lacking in quality."
1,"If I could give it minus stars, I would","I thought that the first 3 ""Vampire Chronicles"" were marvellous - original, exciting and totally absorbing. Then came ""Body Thief"", and I began to think that Anne Rice was all written-out. The mind-bogglingly dire ""Memnoch"" confirmed it (it's got to be just about the most boring and ridiculous book anyone has ever got published), so I decided not to bother with any more of her books. However, Armand is my favourite vampire creation of any writer and I had to read his story. I shouldn't have bothered. How could Mrs Rice make so little of such a fascinating character? I so wish she'd concentrated on Armand when she could still write, way back in the early '90s (his should really have been the 3rd ""Chronicle""). If you loved the early vampire novels re-read them and steer well clear of this one."
2,"Great imagery, bad plot.","I personally found this book to be scraping the bottom of the vampire barrel, there was nearly no plot, and it left me so confused at times that I just wanted to rip it from it's bindings. I really liked Armand, but this really spoiled the whole picture. If you like your vampires the way they are, leave this book lay."
1,Big disappointment!!!,"I could not believe Anne Rice was the author!! I have read all of her books and this if one of the worst. If I could, I would rate this with a zero star!"
1,Read it but don't expect anything worth remebering.,"If you loved Armand its okay. Well, sort of. Maybe why Vampires hate living is because after two books your story will go nowhere. This isn't the mysterious Armand we wonder about. Not the pain seeker who lets Lestat and Louis treat him like a weakling. In my opinion, Armand could of killed Lestat in Paris but instead chose to let Lestat beat him. I believe Armand wouldn't be in the whole child thing either (i.e. Bengi etc.). Why? Because Armand always wants to be the dependent. (sorry for any spelling or gramatical errors.)"
1,"Sad, So Very Sad!","What has happened to Anne Rice? This is a charming, intelligent, witty, and amusing writer who used to be able to translate these qualities to her fiction. This is a knack she appears to have lost or, inexplicably, abandoned. ""The Vampire Armand"" is preciously written, far too exquisite to bear. The complaint is not about the notion of homsexual vampires, but about the effeteness of the language which Rice employs. Where once her idiom was overripe and naughty (particularly in her ""Beauty"" series), now it is simply rancid and distasteful.One good thing to be said about the book: it's her best work since ""Lasher"". And that is very, very sad. Rice used to be great fun, even dirty fun: now she is simply churning out the perfumed prose as fast and as prolifically as her sense-dead zealots will snort it up."
2,Too many words; not enough action.,"I am a fan of Ms. Rice's earlier books, but lately it seems everything she writes is more like a textbook history lesson done with purple prose. I found Armand to be an interesting idea and a good set up for a good story, but it somehow failed. I don't want to read four pages of prose about what color a satin pillow is. Usually, I forgive the purple prose in her vampire books because I figure the vampire sees the world through different, more sensitive eyes and they are poetic, gothy, angst ridden creatures anyway, but her last few books have been almost unbearable. I barely got through Armand. His relationship with Marius seemed very contrived and didn't have much of a point to it other than to showcase the sensuality of the vampires. I am now solid on never buying an Anne Rice Book again, unless I hear that she has quit with the 4000 word descriptions of trivial things. It is too bad because I enjoy her earlier work greatly."
2,When the plot got lost,"Perhaps one of the most enigmatic of Anne Rice's vampire community I was so looking forward to reading about Armand. Her characters have a way of being wholly believable and it was with great enthusiasm that I began this book, after all her makebelieve world is usually so vivd and consumes you so entirely.I was sorely disappointed with this book, although Anne Rice is known for her purple prose this book takes it to new heights of tedium. So consumed is she with the power of the pen the story gets lost and left behind early on in the book. This book is an exercise in endurance, you really don't care about the story after the first 50 or so pages you just become determined to see it through to the end.For any ""fan"" of the vampire chronicles it is a must read book, but it isn't a good book and definitely not one to return to again and again like an old and welcome friend."
2,armand- what happened?,"I really did not like this novel, because it seemed too mass produced. i loved anne rice books before i read this one, she was my favorite author. from what i could gather from interviews with her and comments she made on her web page, (about her writing)it seems to me she is no longer writing from the heart. i love the earlier books but not this one. i thought it had no story to it except to give readers a lesson on material culture of the era. when armand or other charachters did get speckled into the chapter they were too worried about who was having sex with the other. why? what did that have to do with the cronicles as a whole? personally i thought this book was a real let down to the anne rice fan and to the series. although i did give two stars instead of one beacuse i did learn a little about history that i hadn't known before."
3,vintage rice. please do sequel to mummy!!!!!,This is vintage rice. The characters are as erotic as ever. The plot however is somewhat familiar if you are a rice fan. I enjoyed the book but would love to have her do a sequel to the Mummy.
5,The Vampire Armand: splendid and worthwhile,"I have read this book five times and shall read it many more. Like all of Anne's books, it never tires or bores me. It is not a rehash; it is another point of view--Armand's, and as such, worth telling. Those of you who do not like this version of Marius must realize that this is how Armand sees him. Stay with Lestat's view of him if you like. The same is true for the rest of the book. I am thrilled to have a story through Armand's eyes. Anne, let the ""zero star"" folks' comments take no hold on you. They simply don't get it, yet cannot be blamed for that. This book will be what it is to each of us. To me, it was finding someone I thought I'd lost, in a way I could not possibly have imagined. Thank you."
1,Living off the flesh of the dead,"How many times can an author tell the same story over and over again...very tiresome. I have read each ""1st in a series book"" of Ms. Rice's with relish (Witching Hour=fabulous; Interview=fabulous) but now maybe a new story outline should be thought out. This is probably the last Anne Rice book I shall ever purchase."
3,"A good, but not great, book.","I have read all of Anne Rice's vampire books, and have enjoyed them. The Vampire Armand was interesting to me, however I don't know if I could recommend it to someone who has not read a number of her other books. It seemed to help fill in the blanks left in the Armand/Marius story, but it was unquestionably the least compelling of all the Vampire Chronicles series. But let's face it: if you're a fan of Anne Rice, you are getting this book. What choice have you?"
5,Whining Is A Redeeming Feature,"Honestly, this is my favorite Vampire Chronicles book. Not because it's the best but because it clears up the missing pieces of her series.Marius and Armand have always been a mystery. Although, you learn a little about Marius' earlier years you know almost nothing of Marius' time with Armand and nothing of Armand's early years. And yes it is on the ledge of homoerotica but it is, nonetheless, tasteful. And throughout the entire series there's been homoerotic references so it was bound to happen.I hated Totbt and disliked Qotd and Memnoch was slightly redeeming but Armand is like a stitching to a worn but extravagant suit.But Interview with the Vampire and The Vampire Lestat are still the best in the series."
1,this book drained the last life of the vampire chronicles,"Why does Ms Rice continue with this same tired story? We all cannot help but read it, since it started out so very good. PLEASE someone stop her I cannot bear to read another."
2,Not exactly the tribute we'd hoped for the beautiful Armand.,"This book could easily have stopped after the burning of Marius, at which it becomes a rehash of things past, both with the vampires and Anne Rice. It finally satisfies a need for Armand's origins and his creation by Marius (perhaps Rice is trying to remind us that Armand was never a fortysomething Spaniard); this portion is erotic and enchanting. the rest merely seems a soliloquy inviting Lestat back to the stage, created from the same theophilosophical thread as Memnoch, which was more thought-provoking. The two most interesting questions are never answered: Is Bianca a vampire, and more important, why did Marius never seek Armand after his ""century-long convalescence?"" In any case, Lestat is up from the cathedral floor, which seems to have been the purpose of the book anyway."
2,Oh to go back in time!,"I was a big Ann Rice fan till I wasted my money on the Pandora beauty fest. What has happened to the sharp writing of her previous books? While I have nothing against homosexuals I thought I was buying a vampire book, not a well written pseudo child porn poetry book. Where is the Ann Rice I used to know? George Corbeil"
2,I just don't understand.,"What has happened to my queen? With the frist three Chronicles I was in complete awe of her storytelling talent, but in her last three novels she seems to ramble on and has trouble creating and sticking to a plot. I just hope she regains her wits and focuses more on publishing quality work rather than qauntity."
2,OY!,"I have read all of Anne Rice's books in print and this one, like Pandora, has truly fallen away into a made for movie (or worse T.V) snore session. She has removed the romance and poetry that use to caress away the misery of normal life.Did your stint with the HOLLYWIERD people chase your muse away? Im living in Heidelberg Germany and was so excited about this new venture. My favorite angry angel ARMAND what a dissapointment. Wait for paperback if you must read it, its cheaper."
5,Continues the series!,"If you've enjoyed the Vampire books, strap in for another installment. Great reading. For more paranormal, check out some of Robert Doherty's stuff-- more modern, but also very intriguing."
1,Couldn't Finish the Book,"Remember when Rice used to publish her porn under a pen name? Ahh, the good old days, when you knew the name Anne Rice would mean a really good book. I had such high hopes. I was always intrigued by Armand and looked forward to getting a tale similar to Lestat's history. Instead I read scene after scene of licking and kissing and ripping off clothes. Since I'm neither a gay male or a porn reader, I got very tired of this and gave up about 1/3 of the way through. Rice's books were so good in the past -- she was a great storyteller. Now her writing seems self-indulgent...although I can't imagine what would draw a female writer toward gay porn. I hope she writes a good book again someday."
5,seductive,"A wonderful seductive book on how a vampire deals with his spirtuality, you will not be able to put it down!"
5,ANNE RICE HAS DONE IT AGAIN,THE BOOK IS VERY INTERESTING BUT I STILL SEE ARMAND AS ANTONIO BANDERAS. THE FACT THAT I READ THE BOOKS BEFORE THE MOVIE DOES NOT HELP. I CANT PICTURE THE THINGS ARMAND DID IN THE BEG. OF THE BOOK W/ ANTONIOS FACE...W/OUT RUINING ANTONIOS FACE
5,A good addition to the series,"The Vampire chronicles are my favorite Anne Rice books and this book adds much to what has been written. She weaves history and facts with her fictional story so that the lines blur. One of the best books I've read this year. I'm a fan of the paranormal/supernatural in fiction and this is one of the best offerings right now. I also recommend in a somewhat similar yet very different vein, Robert Doherty's Area 51 series-- current paranormal in a complex and alarming story of things that border on the supernatural in 1998 America. His writing isn't as elegant as Rice's but the story is fast-paced and intriguing."
2,Not what I thought at all,"From the beginning of the Vampire Chronicles, I've loved the series. Lestat is amazing, and I'm hooked. However, I was very disappointed by this book. Personally, I'm biased. =) Lestat is my favorite, and I guess no other vampires measure up to him. That was my problem with Armand. I put the book down after reading half of it months ago, and I'm having the hardest time going to pick it up again. Being pleasured by little boys completely grossed me out, but I'm not leery to pick up another book if Lestat is the main character. Maybe I'll get into it again, maybe not. I can't wait to pick up Merrick, and I would gladly re-read previous books in the vampire chronicles. Anne Rice has never let me down with descriptions of where the vampires are, she is one of the best authors I have ever read."
2,An opportunity wasted,"Despite my misgivings after the fourth book in the cronicles I gave in and read this book. Unfortunately I wished that I hadn't or at least that I hadn't hope for more. This book is frankly boring it is over long in it descriptions of places, objects and things and too short excitement. After the wonderful Vampire LeStat this book is a disappointment. It waxes on and on about unimportants things for more pages than are necessary. It misses all the opportunities to become great, skipping over the vampires true nature in exchange for pretty words and descriptions of their surroundings. Vampires are truely soleless beings who are by their nature ruthless, evil and quite sexy. None of the vampires in this tale are any of these things, instead they are just shells not given the opportunity to develop truly vampire natures. Not recommended to LeStat fans."
4,Decent addition to the Vampire Chronicles,"If you've enjoyed previous installments to the Vampire Chronicles, this book should not disappoint you. Armand - a minor yet important character previously appearing in Interview with the Vampire and the Vampire Lestat - now tells his story in this novel. It is explained how he came to be part of the underworld vampires (poor kid) and before that, how he came to live with Marius. While not the BEST book in the Chronicles, this is still a highly satisfying read, revealing more about Marius and introducing the character Bianca. Overall a good read."
4,Deeply Touching,"The darkest depiction of religion I've ever come across, this novel lends an entirely new prespective to Christianity and blind devotion."
4,"Amadeo, the Angel","One of my favorites by Rice. Admonished by many for being trite, and slugish. Must be read with an open mind, and less comparison to greater works such as Queen and Memnoch. Readers follow Armand and his 500 year journey through Europe, and i believe the Middle East, into Present day New Orleans. Ravished are we with erotic stories of passionate love, and distraugt we are left when told of abandonment. Give this book a chance, you will not be disappointed."
2,It could have been worse--2.5 stars,"I've read Anne Rice's work since the publication of ""Interview with the Vampire."" During that time, I've seen her prose become increasingly florid and her narrative structure weaker and weaker. Lush descriptions have always been her forte, and this book includes enough of them to please her most rabid fans. The Venetian Renaissance setting provides an intriguing background for the relationship between the ancient Marius and Armand, his young Russian slave. However, the quality of the story line is overwhelmed by the tendentious purple prose. There is the kernel of a good book here--in fact ""The Vampire Armand"" is much better than Rice's earlier ""Pandora.""-- but it gets buried under the overwrought descriptions and hot house sex scenes. 2.5"
3,I was disapointed,"I think that Anne Rice is a wonderful story teller but I have to admit that I became a bit bored with Armands internal struggle. I kept wanting to shout ""get over it."" For a character that is so strong and stoic I found it surprising that he acted like such a child. This is vampire puberty I guess. I loved the writing, but the ""drama"" was dragged out and the book seemed long.This is not Annes best work."
3,Almost a disappointment.,"I have loved almost everything Anne Rice has written in the past, but this book needs something more than sex. It is amazing how much homosexual activity she has packed into just the first 200 pages. It seems like she is focusing more on this part of Armand's life rather than anything else. But, if you look past that, the story is very good. Parts of the book are enthralling and impossible to put down. Fortunately those parts are often enough to make the book somewhat enjoyable. I advise picking up CRY TO HEAVEN first. Not only is it a better read, but it will prepare you for this book. I recommend this book to those with an open mind. Overall, though, it is a pretty good book."
5,This Book is Fantastic,"This book brought back the real focus of the Vampire series,Vampires. Not the brat prince which I quite frankly was getting quite sick of. I new there were other vampires with interesting beginings just as Louis and Lestat. I am still waiting to hear more of Pandora , Santino, Maherat,Gabrielle,just to name a few I hope this new book puts Ms. Rice back on the path .It was starting to seem like Lestat and the hardy boys mystery. Good job Anne I can hardly wait for the next chronicle."
4,My most beloved character finally finds his voice!,"From his first appearance in Interview, I have loved Armand. There was never enough information about him. I cherished every sentence and reference to this beautiful boy. Read this for him. But I must make a comment about some of his actions that were out of character. His Frankenstien's monster experiment with poor little Claudia was absurd. It dampened an otherwise extraordinary read. Was is only there for shock value or was there supposed to be some kind of character motivation behind it? If you care to skip this little part, then The Vampire Armand is one of the best Rice books ever!"
1,Anne Rice -- the Aaron Spelling of the Vampire genre,"How many spin-offs of an initial vampire novel can there be? The answer is obviously limitless. Like anything that's been overdone, quality declines and with Rice, this decline has been obvious ever since her first well-written and fairly original ""Interview With a Vampire."" For those who cannot have too much bloodsucking and/or gushy immortal torment, this book will satisfy. To me, Rice has lost her power by oversaturating her chosen genre. Can she even write a real novel? Why doesn't she give it a shot and let's see."
4,Another of Anne Rice's vampires tells his tale.,"Journey with Armond from his capture from his Russian homeland to be sold into slavery in Rennaissance era Italy. Share the trauma of being thrown into a dark prison at a very young age. Discover a savior in the form of a vampire. Find the lap of luxury in the house of his benefactor. Experience the change from human to undead. Travel into the present with Armond. This is a very good book. I feel that I may have hurt the story some by reading this as my first in the series, with the exception of seeing the movie ""Interview With A Vampire."" I highly recommend the book, but you may consider reading some of the others in the series that tend to build somewhat of a foundation for this story to rest on."
3,"okay, but it took me a long time to finish",when my friends told me that anne rice's books are great. so i bought the vampire armand. but i was a fool. it took me four months to finish it from the time i bought it. the start wasn't much thrilling. but the middle part was okay because it tells the stories of past vampire chronicles. but would i recommend it? i would say read the first five first before reading this because i had a hard time understanding this book.
5,Vampire Armond: Bi it now ;),"You remember Armond from the movie of Interview.. and the sexy guy that played him stayed in my mind when I read the book. Some have objected to the homosexual encounters in The Vampire Armond.. but bi the way, people, Armond was presented as bi.. I enjoyed the eroticism and the lush and sensual descriptions throughout.. it is about time someone wrote a bestseller for bi's.. Sure, everyone misses Lestat, but he does get a part in this book.. I would love to see a movie made of this one, with its opulent settings.. It is a good read, maybe not for the straightlaced.. but you don't read Anne Rice for plain vanilla, now do you? ;)"
3,Only half a good story,"I have read every vampire book from Anne Rice and I was quite disappointed as I continued on through the weak story line that seemed only to exist so that Ms. Rice could have a background for her explicit scenes of pedophilia. Although I am not offended by homosexual behavior, I am offended by any sexual behavior with children. If Armand was not even producing semen, he was indeed a child.However, I trudged through and finally got to the kidnapping of Armand. At that point the tone completely changed and I felt as though I was reading Rice from her earliest vampire novels.This is one of those rare cases where sticking with a disappointing book actually pays off."
3,"Okay Anne, I was with you right up until this one.","I have enjoyed all the books in the Vampire Chronicles immensely- right up until this one. Aramnd was a bit dissappointing. Perhaps Ms. Rice should concentrate on being the quality writer I know she is. We can wait a couple years for the next installment Anne, as long as it's up to your usual standards"
4,Good,"The first 3 quaters of this book, concerning the story of Armand & Marius, is wonderfuly written, even though its overblown. I enjoyed it very much. The book seemed to be over when they seperated though, and the last part was just aimless drifting. I like historical settings, but its a little irritating when the facts are wrong. By the way Anne, Kiev is a city in Ukraine - NOT Russia."
1,Blah,"I see there is no option for 0 stars. I loved Pandora, it was hard to put down, but Armand is so hard to pick up! Enough sex already! That's all Armand did while he was alive! Pandora at least led an interesting life! Marius was a completely different person in Pandora. Who is this weirdo in Armand? Blah Blah Blah! Anne, I love you, but this sucked!"
1,B-O-R-I-N-G !,"Initially, I was estatic to discover that Armand survived his suicidal attempt. And the story started out interesting enough. I could even tolerate the sexual themes. However, the things that ruined the story was the ENDLESS descriptions, ENDLESS history lessons, and wasted focus on boring Benji and Sybelle. I can pick up a History Book for a history lesson. And environmental/new character descriptions are fine as long as they don't overpower the plot or primary character(s). I desperately wanted more DIALOGUE, PLOT and a TIGHTER story. Also, what was wrong with Lestat? And what's with all the tears? Marius, Louis and the female vampires are not constantly crying like Lestat and Armand. I still love Armand - I just don't feel that Rice did him any justice in this book."
2,unorignal,"this book seems to follow the same format of nearly all of the other vempire chronicals - in the first chapter he decides to record his story - from human to vampire. i am a fan of rice's earlier works - but this one is unoriginal and involves some themes i am not comfortable with. the scene where marius has sex with the young mortal boy bothered me, not the sex part, but the fact that the boy was an orphan and had been horribly abused, and was desperate for love. marius took advantage of this in my oppinion, so growing up he thought he was in love with marius, but he really wasn't given the opportunity to experience a love that was nonsexual."
1,Slow Reading,I have tried to read this book 3 times and all three times I have put the book down because of lack of interesting character development. The characters do not catch the attention of the readers as any of her previous books have. The story becomes slow reading quickly and becomes utterly boring 50 pages in. I thought Anne Rice would be able to develop the main characters a lot better but she fails miserably. I have enjoyed every other book she has written and am suprised at her failure to succeed in writing this novel.
2,An extreme dissapoitment,"I was very disappointed with this book.maybe its a bias, I am not sure, but I cant stand all the references to God in here! its driving me nuts!an update:I thought it would get better when it got to the part of Louis and Claudia and what happened in Interview With the Vampire, but no, it just skimmed over it.Also there is too much of Anne Rice in a way breaking character with Armand, saying things like, ""if you have read the book about Lestat you would know such things..."" Its just not what i expected from her. After reading Interview with the Vampire, and Lestat, and seeing the movies as well, maybe I expected something I don't know a bit darker?I just find this book quite annoying and disappointing. If you have read ALL of her books and like them then go ahead I am sure you will LOVE this book,But if you're like me and have read only a few, you will most likely find it a disappointment as well."
2,Probably my least favorite of the series,I didn't like the character when he was a supporting one in the other books and I like him even less here. Whiney spoiled little brat with way too much drama.The other thing that bugs is this reads like gay fiction. Rice has always brought a great deal of androgyny to her characters but this one is way over the top with it's man/boy love theme throughout.
3,BRING BACK LESTAT,"Thats all i think that needs to be said. As I have read all of her books, except Violin, and Servant. SHe feels most alive writing about her beloved Lestat or the trials of the Mayfais witches. The vampire chronicles, definately some of my favorite works, but ever since Memnoch, the passion just doesnt seem there. Anne, I love you, but please bring back Lestat"
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ!!!!!,"This book was absolutely perfect in every sense. it had everything, horror, sex, imagination. I could not put it down. Many people have complained about the homosexual thing, but remember people, this took place 500 years ago and people were different back then, especially men. I definetely recommend it to every Anne Rice lover. Also, it is probably my 2nd favorite Vampire novel next to The Vampire Lestat."
1,Simply boring,"I just finished the book, and am happy that it's over .. I agree with most of what the reader from New York wrote on October 14, and the one from Northern California on October 18: Once upon a time, Rice's books were a real pleasure .. this one is full of historical inaccuracies, facts in contradiction with some presented in the series previously. The first part with the (to me not too disturbing) homosexual touch might be nice to read, the rest is simply a gathering of confused thoughts and views, sometimes completely out of the context (like the one sentence where she describes Leonardo Di Caprio as a ""young and brillant actor"", what has he got besides a pretty face ? BTW, if anybody wants to see historical inaccuracies at their worst, watch ""The man with the iron mask"" .. it's depressing).Anyway, if Anne Rice doesn't spend time really working on her next book, her time is over.Mine with her is (i.e. I won't buy anything else from her)."
1,The downhill slide of the Chronical has finally hit bottom,The downhill slide of the Vampire Chronicals has finally hirt rock bottom with The Vampire Armand. Ever since The Vampire Lestat (probably her best) the series has deteriorated and rehashed itself again and again. My patience has finally been exhausted. The Vampire Armand is nearly unreadable.
4,Wonderful,"I thought that the first few hundred pages of this book really didn't contain any surprises since armand has pretty much told the story of his life to Lestat in the Vampire Lestat. However, the writing is wonderful and the characters are dazzling. By going over the same story line over and over Mrs Rice makes her characters more real. Marius is one of my favorite characters. It is amazing how each of the charaters manages to keep their individuality. However, the part where Armand performs that strange experiment with Claudia disrupts the grace of her death in Interview. I'll just pretend I never read that. The ending was wonderful. In closing, I can't help but mention that I'm eagerly waiting for the day when Mrs rice would write a story about the elusive gabrielle but for now i guess i'll just have to satisfy myself with the tiny portions on her in TVA."
4,"Not yet finished, but....","Unless she blows it in the last chapter (as she did in Memnoch), it's looking like Anne is back.However, I have a serious gripe with her publisher: Is there not ONE copyeditor or proofreader in the entire PUBLISHING HOUSE who knows the difference between an egg YOLK and an ox or dress YOKE?Driving me batty, that one is.....and it's EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.Anyway, Anne herself seems to be back. And, as for those reviewers who would impose 1998's moral standards on even works of FICTION about 'child sex'--I'm glad, thoroughly thankful, that these people aren't in charge of libraries. Get beyond it, people. It happened--all over the world. It's history. Ergo, it's acceptable fodder for the fiction writer. And, it's such a SMALL part of the book, it seems odd that one would obsess over it.So far, a worthier read than the last few books. Best since ""Tale of the Body Thief."""
2,BITE ME,"I actually bought this book a few years ago, but I stopped reading it for some reason. Now I know that reason, it was because it was SO BORING! It drags, it doesn't flow like some of Anne Rice's previous books, I didn't even finish the whole thing because I couldn't put up with the dragging. It's a waste of money and it is utterly BORING. Just read: The Vampire Lestat, Pandora and the Interview With The Vampire, if you haven't read any of Anne Rice's other works."
3,"Interesting back story, difficult read","I wouldn't say I'm a huge Rice fan (the only Rice books I've read are Interview With the Vampire and this one), so my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt. This book provided me some interesting information about Armand, Lestat, Louis, etc. However, I thought Rice had a tendency to veer off into extraneous details. I also found the descriptions of the gay sex to be a little stomach churning for me, but I can deal with that. I did enjoy reading about Armand's childhood and family. That being said, it was still a difficult read for me. I probably should have gotten the second installment before jumping into this story. Die hard fans will probably enjoy this book."
1,Terrible,"Unless you are a completist on the vampire chronicles, as I am, skip this book. It is awful. What is the dill-lee-yo with the change in Marius between the two books. I hope in a later book we find Aramond insane so this book could possiably NOT be part of continuity."
1,"Give it up, Anne. You should have quit when you were ahead.","I forced myself to read Pandora because I've always read the Vampire Chronicles and especially enjoyed the first two. Even after wishing I'd never read Pandora, I gave this one a try because I remember and had liked Armand. I pushed through 140 pages and quit. I quit the series. It is boring, long-winded with no plot movement whatsoever. Oh, well. Had to end sometime."
1,I was dissapointed too far out,I am an Anne Rice and hope to continue to be one. But this book and Violin are testing me. It was quite difficult for me to finish!!!
1,High Decay,"Anne Rice has betrayed her gifts and become a hack. There is not a single well-crafted sentence in this book nor one idea that is not silly and jejeune. She once was fun to read; now, reading her is a chore born of the hope that she has recaptured her spark. Not so here, at any rate. This is just a messy pile of garbage being presented as tempting decadence. Save your money and buy ""Bag of Bones"". At least Steven King has a plot to flesh out."
3,The Vampire Armand,"I adore Anne Rice as an author. I have read almost all her books and some i like much better then others. The Vampire Armand was a good book, and great addition to The Vampire Chronicles, but it lacked the excitement and thrill of the other book previous to this one. I do recommend reading The Vampire Armand to anyone who is reading the Vampire Chronicles, but understand that is is no Vampire Lestat or The Devil Memnoch."
4,a good read,"Don't know where to put vampires in my list but this will do. The Anne Rice books, particularly early books on vampires are good. This one is very good and interesting. It takes you along with the story to see what is going to happen.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,Un gran libro para leer,"En realidad pienso que este libro vale mucho la pena, y la verdad el precio es increible en mexico este libro cuesta al rededor de $500 pesos asi que esta super barato."
2,"I want to like this, I really do, but ..........","I LOVE Anne Rice. I have read about Vampires and Witches virtually from cover to cover in one sitting. I can not get enough, but Armand ... weeeelll that is turning out to be another story. I am finding it heavy going, a little bit too descriptive and not enough real meat. I have read other reviews which are concerned with child-related material, but that was not my biggest problem which was keeping the book in my hands long enough to read it all. I am 2/3rds through now, come hell or high water I will finish. Who knows, I may even change my opinion by the end. Yes, who knows! However, this will NEVER put me off Anne Rice, she is still one of my favourite authors."
3,"entertaining, but not her best","This is not Anne's best work, but it does give you insight into the background of Armand. I do however, enjoy the details of Italian history and descriptions of clothing and painting techniques."
1,Not a good quality,"I used with I7100 for 2 month, almost lost MY BB it just felt apart, it is glued together.Not Recomended"
2,A pale imitation of Ignatius Reilly,"I'm always looking for literate, satirical books with a wicked sense of humor. Having read all of these 5-star reviews, and convinced that this was one of those rare finds, I rushed out to get a copy of ""Idiots in the Machine."" Instead of a book bursting with originality or wit, I found instead what can only be called a wannabe...the main character is flat, contrived, and totally preposterous and forced. Imitation may be the greatest form of flattery, but it doesn't mean it's a good read. Try ""A Confederacy of Dunces"" if you haven't already, or maybe Julian Barnes or Kurt Vonnegut or TC Boyle."
2,100% Derivative,"Agree with the other reviewer who called it a ripoff of Confederacy of Dunces. This is a highly-contrived, paper-thin work that just labors through a plot that loosely borrows from dozens of better works. If you think this is a 4 or 5 star read and in any way funny, you need to read Confederacy of Dunces, John Irving, Michael Chabon, et.al."
2,Not What I expected,"Not only was the delivery of this product very slow (took nearly 1 month) but the size was not what I expected. The diameter of the product is significantly smaller than what I have used in the past and therefore it was difficult to stack in the valve containment device. Lastly, I anticipated a tablet that would dissolve slowly over time to feed continuously. This product turned to mush as soon as it was subjected to water."
4,raindrip fertizer,I like the convenience of the product for drip irrigation. I wish it were a little cheaper and more available.
5,Easy to use,This product works perfectly with the Raindrip Irrigation Fertilizer system. It make it easy to direct fertilizer to specific plants through the use of your drip system and the tablets are clean and easy to install in the fertilizer container. Seems to be a great product from an installation standpoint. The proof will be at the end of the growing season as to the quality of the actual fertilizer.
2,Cheap,"Price is inexpensive, but product is only worth the price I paid. Not much. I bought 2 for my business, and am almost embarrassed to have them out. Cheap quality. Would not recommend. I give it a 2 instead of a 1 b'cuz it does serve the purpose. :-)"
1,It really is worth [...],"I bought this to use as a towel rack in my small bathroom. Putting it together I soon realized why it's so cheap.The end caps for the legs and top hooks are made of a very flimsy, brittle plastic, and they do not fit properly. Several of them broke when I tried to put them on. The ones that didn't break were misaligned, leaving sharp metal ends bare.The bolts are completely visible after assembly. Not just the heads of the bolts - you can also see the shaft of the bolt between two parts. Things don't line up flush with each other.And finally, it is very unstable. A towel I was using caught on one of the hooks and flung the rack at my face. I ended up with a fat lip and a cut.I promptly threw it out and spent the money to buy a nice towel rack, like I guess I should have done at the start."
3,Quite good but not that sturdy,"Bought this coat rack a few years ago and it is still in a good shape. Thus, it tends to tilt over if you hang only a heavy coat on it. It is very light weight."
3,not very motivating!,"It was O.K., but the instructor is less than motivating.I liked how she got up and watched the others doing it, while not doing it all herself. Would not recommend it. I want someone to motivate me...."
3,An interesting mystery,"The Mystery of a Hansom Cab (which everyone should read) was interesting as it had multiple detectives.The Green Mummy doesn't have any detectives of note - the case is solved the suspects. You dont' see many like that.The characters are a mixed bag. Fortunately, the one I really didn't like - well, it was justified. The character of Cockatoo is unfortunate in my opinion. A lot more could have been done with him, but unfortunately, he was a victim of the European belief of what he would be.It's an OK story, and free, so give it a shot, but start with the Mystery of a Hansom Cab. A better story, imo, for Fergus Hume."
5,Book 2,"It is important that you read them in order as one book ends, the other starts.Very captivating with good characters and a good story, as are all three books. Excellent for all who like Fantasy novels, with magic, dragons and monsters."
3,Bogs Down Quite a Bit,"This book, though slow, is still slightly better than the rushed and cramped third book. The authors seem to spend a lot of time on inconsequential events and then rush past those that are important (as one reads on). The repetitive story arc where the army seeks the shadowed elves becomes mundane and several times I almost stopped reading.It also amazes me how the authors seemingly fit years of events into a trilogy spanning little more than one year. An enjoyable series but not quite up to the standard of Brooks, Eddings, or Weis & Hickman."
5,BUY THESE BOOKS,"This book and the first one by these two amazing authors should be on everyone reading list. I have converted two people who had never, ever wanted to read sci-fi because of these two books. I can't wait for the third. Please hurry!!!!"
4,Charlie Brown Christmas,"Very cute and a must have for Peanuts collectors or just for fun for the holidays...tree ""transforms"" form tiny and sparseto full and decorated"
5,a more thorough track listing,"This is a rare compilation of music recorded on radio station WXRT (either in studio or during broadcasts of concerts), some of the archives going back to the 1970's. Since there wasn't a proper run down on this page, I'm adding a track listing.1 Talking Heads - Pulled Up 4:062 Robert Cray - Guess I Showed Her 4:083 The Freddy Jones Band - In A Daydream 6:294 Richard Thompson - I Can't Wake Up to Save My Life 2:585 Lou Reed - Walk on the Wild Side 6:426 Bob Mould - Wishing Well 4:397 Buddy Guy - Dust My Broom 4:308 BoDeans - Sylvia 3:419 Concrete Blonde - Dance Along the Edge 5:3010 Bruce Cockburn - If I Had a Rocket Launcher 6:2111 Bob Marley - Natty Dread 8:3112 The Smithereens - Blood and Roses 6:40"
3,The band is the problem.,"The watch is just what I wanted. The problem is the band, it needs a link or two taken out, and my wife has a real problem getting the clasp open. Maybe it will get easier as it is broken in or she gets used to it, but that is the reason for the lower rating I gave, as the watch itself is great."
5,Buying More Today,"These WORK! Each package contains eight little ""spongy"" red rings. They look like smaller, squishy red Life Savers. You must wear rubber gloves when handling. Simply place the rings around the base of each stalk on the infested rose bush. I am buying more because you really need to put one on EACH stalk. My climbing rose looks great after 4-5 days EXCEPT for the one stalk that did not have a ring. As the rest of the bush is treated, that single stalk looks like an aphid resort."
2,"Ok, but huge tablets","The taste is *OK* but I would not order again. The tablets are at least 3/4"" in diameter and the container itself is huge - takes up more room than I expected in my fridge. Chalky tasting. Ok for vegetarian chewable multivitamin given the price but if other alternatives were available at the same cost I'd try another one."
2,"Good multi, but tastes awful!","Having worked in a vitamin store many years ago, I am very familiar with Country Life products. They are an excellent product and I trust the purity and strength of their vitamins and minerals. This is a great product, IF YOU CAN GET AROUND THE TASTE! It is horribly bitter with a long nasty aftertaste. I will not order again as I threw the entire bottle out. Nature's Plus is also a fantastic product and they taste great! Just ordered them to replace the Country Life I tossed."
3,Was a fan,I loved these things until my latest purchase. Did they change the formulation? I think I'm allergic to the latest batch. Difficulty breathing and massive mucus production beginning immediately after chewing. This is a reproduceable effect at least for me. I'm looking for a replacement product. Very sad.
3,hard,"These tablets are large and pretty hard to bite into at first, and quite gritty to chew up enough to swallow. The taste isn't so great either, but I can live with that if it's doing the job. I hate swallowing large pills so I went this route and it does get me to take a multi more often."
1,taste horrid,I take a lot of chewable vitamins and am not picky. In my opinion these taste horrid. I couldn't even finish them I just threw them away.
4,A FRIENDLY GIANT,"Although the hero resembles an overgrown Pillsbury Doughboy, Clay Boy by Mirra Ginsburg, pictures by Jos. A. Smith is a fanciful tale about a blossoming giant.Youngsters do enjoy tales of giants so this may intrique them."
1,Too scary for little ones--and maybe bigger ones too!,"I thought this would be a cute version of the gingerbread man. My three year-old was intrigued but troubled by this story. As another reviewer mentioned, there are graphic illustrations of clay boy eating everybody. I thought it would be good for my daughter to see that everybody is saved in the end. But then she wanted to know, ""where is Clay Boy?"" How to explain that this clay boy who has been talking and eating and walking around has been unceremoniously shattered into a million pieces to save the townspeople inside? Thank God I only borrowed it from the library and can return it promptly."
5,Kids love it!,A wondeful twist from the original Gingerbread story. My preschool children love it and I am not allowed to put it away. The color pictures depict the story in a amusing fashion.
1,Another Boring List Book,This book would have been a lot more interesting if it included reproductions of every survey from the decade.A monkey could have compiled these lists.
5,A saga worth the time,"I just finished this book and really enjoyed it. This book was so fascinating and well written. I live near Lowell and am looking forward to seeing the museums. I had no idea that life was like this back in the mid-1800's. Nancy Zaroulis makes a narrative that is hard to put down and teaches us about the times -- politics, industrial revolution, immigration of Irish and Germans -- and what it was like to be a woman trying to live independently. A great book!"
2,Not worth the price,This book did not meet my expectations. I felt that there are a lot of books on this subject that give more informatio
2,phony testimonials,The book may be good. I don't know but these people have obviously written their own testimonials. How do the readers happen to know how many have been sold etc.
5,Well worth reading,This book fully explaines it all. I got a trust through a lawyer and it was just as this book says. There are diagrams to show and the language is very easy to understand.
1,Disappointing,"Just received this DVD and was sorely disappointed. I guess I've been spoiled by only watching the good ones with David Wells and Ciaran O'Keefe so far. The THREE episodes on here (yes, only three) all have that over dramatic/over acting Derek A. in them. In addition, they were not at all scary, nothing substantial happened in any of them, and I actually fell asleep during the last one. Very sorry I wasted my money on this. Derek's constant yammering throughout all three episodes gets old fast. Seriously, the man does not shut up. I recommend season 7 and up only."
4,"Great to watch, informative, exciting.",The Spirit Garden: A Medium's JourneyI throughly enjoyed this. I will buy the rest of the series. It is a high quality show.
4,Does NOT work with ALL Nokia phones,"Did not work with the Nokia 6102. Seemed like a good charger though, and it wasn't a hassle to return."
3,Problems !,"Same as book ""Her wicked ways"". Please read review on the mentioned book. I' m trying to like my kindle but ......"
5,I Am Hooked,These books are very well done.I am on number three of this series and I have been continually pleased.Very fun read.
2,Not great,"The characters have few redemptive qualities. Neither of the main characters have much to recommend them, there is little character development, the story is trite and unexciting, and the end is suddenly and unbelievably resolved into a happily ever after. I will not be reading the rest of the series."
1,You have got to be kidding!,"As my daughter used to say, CHEESY! How did this author ever get published?? There are much better authors out there."
1,Ugh! Don't Bother,"I was totally turned off in the beginning when the 13 year heroine falls for the 30ish year old *hero.* I tried, but couldn't finish the book, nor even get 1/4 way through it. It just felt wrong. Others may differ, but this is my opinion on it."
2,Worth every penny...,"...especially since i got it for free. The plot is tortured, the heroine annoying and our hero is a cliche. I made it half way through before i gave it up. Save yourself!"
2,Don't remember,I'm going to reread this so I can remember what it was about..if I recall I thought it was very detail & long.
4,I love it when true love wins over obsticals.,"I njoyed the characters and felt the story fulfilled my desire for love, romance and obsicals for true love to finally triumph."
5,Quite a captivating family!,"This book kept me thoroughly interested the whole way through. It's also written well and with a lot of class. The story actually surprised me and the love story felt so very real; it's not some bit of fluff with a few stares and sighs and then, ""Hey, I'm in love with you."" It was very subtle and developed so nicely. Raveneau and Devon felt like a real couple and I am more than likely going to follow their story into the next books."
2,Stunned at the 4 and 5 Star Reviews for this Book,"I have never written a review on a book that I didn't finish. Actually, I had completed about 3/4ths of this book when I began to skim and then skipped to the end.The characters and story line were interesting enough but something was plainly missing in the relationship between Andre and Devon. Devon was young and immature so her foolish desires and the way she dealt with life could be excused. However, I hated the fact that Andre kept on having affairs even after he was obviously in a serious relationship with Devon, especially when he attempted to get it on with one of her best friends, Azalea, in the same inn where he and Devon were staying while Devon and Azalea's husband were downstairs. Give me a break!All I can say is Ugh! I had such expectations for the Ravaneau Series after all the good reviews that were posted."
1,Couldn't finish it,ok I've said it. I just couldn't finish this book as soon as I read she griefed the death of Caleb whom she knew for mere days more than her own mother. I also don't like Devon & all of her tantrums.
4,Pirates and Romance,"I have just finished this book and really enjoyed it. Nice balance of Pirates, Romance andinformation on the early American wars and Benedict Arnold."
4,Good read,This was a good book with lively characters and a riveting storyline. This might be a book you won't be able to put down.
1,Worst Hero Ever,"This novel was terrible. The hero was a complete cad. I'm all for reformed heros but he never reforms! Randomly at the end of the novel he decides he in facts loves the Devon even though he has treated her like complete crap and slept with other women while they were ""together"". The heroine is quite remarkable that she puts up with him but I really don't like characters that enter into marriages with other men when the man they love is there but not the groom. It's not that I don't mind characters with flaws but these are severe enough that I just didn't find the characters likable enough. This didn't stop with the main characters either. The heroine's best friend tried to sleep with the hero even though she was engaged to another man and she could guess that the heroine was in love with him. The heroine found out and they were still friends. Awkward. All and all I can't see why this book has gotten any good reviews."
2,Pretty predictable stuff,"Imagine all of the traditional romance tropes. They're all here, including a beautiful but TSTL heroine, a handsome, emotionally distant hero, a plucky supporting character who exists mainly to serve Our Heroes. Overall, this was a predictable read and it's nothing I would recommend to a new (or discerning) romance reader."
3,Helpful but not perfect,"Don Fairbairn's book goes very deep into some issues that are rather esoteric and sometimes boring, but of course the detail is sometimes (depending on your interest) very helpful. All in all his book is not a comparative theological treatise as much as it is a book that tries to explain the depths of Eastern Orthodox theology. As such it represents more the views of a few Orthodox theologians and does not address the thinking of the common Orthodox believer. It does not address major conflicts from a protestant perspective, only offering understanding of the Orthodox perspective. It is more suited to theologians than the average reader."
4,good reading for Orthodox and non-Orthodox,"Donald Fairbairn has done a good job of presenting the Eastern Orthodox religion in a dialogical and understandable way. This book is very helpful for understanding Eastern Orthodoxy, especially because Fairbairn accurately displays the fact that there are differences among those of the Orthodox Church. Fairbairn is helpful by showing us Christians what we can learn from Orthodoxy, and what Orthodoxy can learn from Christians. If you are not afraid to have your own views critiqued, whether you be a Christian or whether you be an Orthodox person, then this book is for you."
4,bettyboop evening,i just like the way it looksnice size face nice and eyesshe is a cutie and looks real
2,excellent effort,"I would like to rate this higher than 2 stars, but I couldn't hear half of it. The producers need to work on their sound recording technique. It was still a great movie, though, I watched it all the way through, even though I missed half of the dialogue, because it was captivating and different. I found the visual effects distracting, at first, but I started liking them after a few minutes, because they really added to the other-worldly aspect of the film. It is worth the rental price, and to tell you the truth, I hope these guys make more horror movies, because I think they have something interesting to say, and they really add something unique to the genre."
1,Piece of crap,"You have got to be kidding me. What a picec of crap. Can I give it a -5 stars? This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Stupid, ridiculous photography, ugly untalented actors. You name it, it is soooo bad. Give me my money back."
2,Very Golden,It appears to be a mix of silver and gold on the web page but turned out be very golden.
1,Garbage,"This book is not worth reading, not worth carrying home from the store, and not worth the money I paid. How could anyone enjoy a book without a single likeable character."
3,"Holds ones interest, but the author needs a fact checker.","I'm only about half way through the audio version, and generally finding it holding my interest, both to find out who done it and because of some of the tittilating details of Delia's past.What bothers me is that Groom made some really serious gaffs...He referred to the ""San Fernando Valley near Sacramento"" (I believe he must mean the San Joaquin Valley) and he talks about having a glass of Chardonnay-Pinot Grigio...which are actually two different grape varieties rather than a single wine.Little stuff like that drives me crazy...it makes me suspicious of other more important stuff.And if Groom wants to name drop wine in the future...I'll be glad to be his wine consultant...I've been writing a syndicated wine column for 32 years."
2,Skip it!,"As I love a good suspense novel, I bought this book based on the jacket synopsis and was deeply disappointed when I finished reading it. I found all of the characters completely unlikeable and underdeveloped, and towards the end I didn't care WHO was blackmailing Delia. I also found it completely unbelievable that every man Johnny spoke with during his investigation had no problem immediately opening up to him about Delia. It's implausible that each would share intimate details to a complete stranger who thinks they may be a blackmailer! I, too, found the movie character/actor references annoying. Finally, I was perturbed that the author chose not to reveal Delia's secret sexual ""tricks"" after going on and on about them throughout the book (couldn't think of anything spicy enough?) In all, I found this book to be boring and not quite the page-turner I was hoping for. If you want a real sexual, suspenseful, who-done-it, check out Romeo by Elise Title."
4,Exciting debut novel,"I came across OVERDRIVE several years after it was first published. I was surprised at the pacing of the story. Often first novels suffer from the proper lack of pacing. While Overdrive does suffer from this flaw at times, power of the author and his sense of pacing.I found it to be more of a life study of the characters,and in particular how they view themselves and are forced to face the consequences of their decisions.As a first novel OVERDRIVE offers a glipse of a powerful new voice, One that will hopefully mature and work through the flaws of the first. I am looking forward to the next work by the author."
1,mold factory,I only hand wash this unit but water still gets caught in the handle and is the perfect place for black mold to grow. Poor handle design = buying a different brand.
3,Bowl not sturdy,"I recieved the Kitchenaid 7-cup food processor as a wedding gift about May 2010. It works great and looks beautiful. I just have a few complaints about it. The food kind-of spills out into the center hole where the blade sits if you are not careful. I have never owned a food processor before so I may have over filled it. It was a very messy process but I think with more practice it will be better. Again, I have never owned one of these before so I'm not sure if I was removing the bowl incorrectly but I managed to break handle locking mechanism the third or fourth time I used it. Either there is a design flaw or just an ease of use flaw. I'm glad they sell replacement bowls because otherwise I like this model."
1,Don't Buy This Junk!,"I had this processor a year and the molded plastic where the bowl twists on has chipped away to the point that it doesn't hold the bowl in place anymore. You won't get ANY support from KitchenAid if your warranty has run out, except their generosity at selling you a new one for $30 more than you can find it online. They CLAIM they haven't had any complaints about this problem, but I seriously doubt that. There is no way a user could do this kind of damage; it's just junk, never did crush ice like they claim and I don't think it's worth a quarter of the price. I'm ditching it for a Cuisinart! I'm finding many of KitchenAid's other products, besides their mixers are very disappointing products."
3,Not bad for the price but...,"...doesn't seem as well-engineered or sturdy as other KA appliances I've used. I never had a food processor before and now wonder how I did w/o one!The things I wish were different:- Tube is too narrow to slice bulkier items like med - lg potatoes or onions. I just didn't pay attention to this aspect when I bought it.- Seem to chop things too fine but then there's still a few larger pieces left in the bowel. Could be my inexperience in using it.Otherwise, it is a nice unit and for the price I'm not unhappy. I find I use it more than I thought and do enjoy cooking more now that the prep is so easy - wish I had bought one years ago!"
2,Junk,"Buyers beware! This unit costs way too much considering how flimsy it is. My wife has used ours 10 or 12 times and already the handle on the container has failed. It doesn't take much to make it fail. She was trying to turn the container off the base and the handle fractured a small tab off. This jammed the safety mechanism inside the handle to the point it will no longer let the unit even turn on. We did NOT buy this from Amazon, but since we do make purchases here, I thought it best to let others know. We are going to buy the Cuisinart Prep 11 Plus DLC2011. It was rated #1 by [...]."
1,Terribly designed,"There is a major design flaw with the product. The bowl is secured at the bottom by a plastic ring that has three notches that are located at the bottom of the shaft that holds the knife blade. After the bowl was properly locked into place, I started the processor, but shortly thereafterafter, one of the three notches on the plastic ring broke off. Now the bowl cannot be held securely in place. I purchased this processor less than 2 years ago, and since then have used it only a very few times. After this happened to my processor, I looked at some of the larger and newer KitchenAid processors, and found that they eliminated this serious design flaw. Since my processor was out of warranty, and since the estimate was that it would cost $32 for shipping + parts + labor, I figured that for that cost I could buy a new processor. And as another customer noted, I will be sure NOT to buy a KitchenAid."
2,Broken After 2 Years Light Use,"As other reviewers have reported, the plastic shaft that spins the blade broke on my processor. I used it maybe twice a month on average during those two years. There is no excuse for this breaking aside from poor craftsmanship. I rated it two stars as opposed to one because it did its job well during those two years. Not so sure I'll be getting another KitchenAid brand food processor after seeing other reviewers had the same problem."
1,its true,"This item didn't last long. Purchased last night from Costco for 60 bucks. Used it once 3 hours ago and worked fine (mashed two bananas). Tried to use it an hour later and it wouldn't come on. Tried everything but it didn't budge. Okay so as i was writing this decided to plug it in one more time (now 1 hour later) and what do you know it came on. Not sure if I will ride this one out or return to Costco for a replacementbut I am disappointed as the unit is unstable.Felecia, Ca"
3,Except for the flimsy handle...,"Except for the flimsy handle this would have gotten 5 stars.Great performance, ample power. Slicing in particular yields very thin vegetables; just right for soups and salads.Many review mention the handle, specifically the latching / locking mechanism. Mine broke when a carrot bounced around and struck the lid. I didn't have the serial number handy so customer service said get it and call them back (to ""better serve me""). It's still in warranty so I expect it will be replaced at NC when I get back with them."
2,Stopped working after 11 months,"We wanted a small, basic food processor since we don't use it very often. The KitchenAid had a much smaller feed tube than the Cusinart it replaced, so it was less convenient for preparing vegetable shreds and slices. It seemed perfectly adequate until it stopped working 10 1/2 months after we bought it. It's possible to fidget with the lower handle to engage the interlock button, but the plastic is very flimsy and I doubt this will work for long.It's within the 1-year warranty, but we decided to write it off and get a Cuisinart. The DLC 10-S is worth the extra $20."
3,"Worked o.k. while it lasted, but it broke a little soon","Granted, my last food processor before this one was a CuisinArt that I purchased way back when CuisinArt was still CuisinArt. But this food processor was never a 4- or 5-star item (because of the clunky and clumsy way it went together and the way the design of the grating attachment, for example, made it harder to clean than necessary). But I was disappointed that it didn't last longer than it did (I just threw mine out). I would report exactly how long I had it, but I can't find my record of its purchase. I think it's only been a couple of years though... I'm going back to CuisinArt."
2,Lousy Craftmanship,"I only used my processor about five times, before the top plastic piece of the handle decided to crack rendering the product virtually useless. Fortunately, a little duct tape and some finagling keeps it functioning. Sadly, this happened outside the warranty and just when I was beginning to enjoy using the item. No replacement parts are available, only a full bowl which is half the price of the entire unit. Someone out there has to make a higher quality product. I also observed a bit of build up of gunky food inside the handle."
5,"Quality Appliance, But Flimsy Handle On Work Bowl","Just got mine in the mail! One thing you must know before buying this appliance is that it weighs about 15 pounds or so- heavy. This makes it difficult to store away when not in use. No problem if you have lots of counter space, but I prefer my small counter to be free of appliances. I wasn't prepared for it- my old one weighed only about 5 lbs and I could easily whip it out when I needed it.That being said, it looks great on the counter. It is a nicely designed product, inside and out. Easy to clean, not too big or too small.7/14/09 UPDATE: I am still in love with this appliance! I use it all the time.12/10/10 UPDATE: The bowl handle broke and now I am replacing it for $30. I've been dangerously rigging it with a chopstick for several months and now I can't even do that. The handle just won't hold up. This work bowl needs major design improvement!"
2,broke twice,"October 4, 2012: A few months ago, the plastic shaft cracked. We fixed it with epoxy glue. Yesterday, the mechanism in the handle that controls the power has broken. Plastic, plastic, Plastic. JUNK. This is machine used about once per week, never in dishwasher, etc. The motor works well, but if the plastic parts break, you can't use this appliance. JUNK!Original review: The base of this process has no crevices to catch food. Wipes off easily. Blade, bowl, and cover sort of ""snap"" in place. Base is heavy, sturdy. Grater/slicer attachment actually allows you to process almost the entire piece carrot, cucumber, etc. without leaving very large pieces. Happy with this Kitchen Aid processor."
1,how DID this make it to market??,"On the good side, it works well. However, the way they designed the handle is completely idiotic! There is an opening where water and goo can enter the handle, yet there is no way to open it to clean it out. After a year of use, I have to throw this thing away strictly because it is completely disgusting! The mold and crud that collects in the handle is nicely visible through the clear inner portion of the handle. What kind of research and development folks do they have working there that could make such a stupid mistake??"
3,Motor broke,After about a year it just died. I used it once a week or so to make baby food. It was nice while it lasted.
1,Horrible plastic bowl design,"While the food processors works great- we have just experienced our THIRD broken latch on the plastic bowl in 1 yr. This is no fault of our own- we treat it very nicely, it is just poorly designed.We kept buying new bowls because as I said, it otherwise works fine...but this is ridiculous.I would really consider another product unless they can re-design the bowl.If you read other reviews you will see this is a common problem"
1,"Processes well, but major defect in work bowl latch; do not buy","Had this a little over 1 year and the latch mechanism failed as stated by many other reviews. Looking at the design I don't see how this could hold up with any type of prolonged use. Generally like Kitchen-aid products, but the work bowl latch is so poorly made is not worth purchasing. Too bad b/c product generally worked well. Stay clear of this model."
1,Broke within a few months,"I've seen this in other reviews, but a small part broke on the handle, which means that the lid won't lock into place and you therefore can't turn the food processor on. I just purchased it less than six months ago, and am now having to purchase a new work bowl (another $30).Update...the new work bowl I purchased a few months ago just broke--the same small part on the handle that enables it to click into place. I've now owned this for a year, and will be buying the second new work bowl. Or maybe I'll just buy a different food processor that isn't so prone to busting!"
3,cheap plastic handle,"The processor works fine for the purpose, but then the plastic handle broke just after warranty was out.Would not recommend for the price.Wish I could get a new blade for my old Remington processor (35 yrs. of age)"
3,If not for the bowl this would be a decent food processor,I purchased this processor as a Christmas present in 2011. After 10 months of occasional use the bowl handle broke. KitchenAid promptly replaced the bowl when I contacted them. Other than my issue with the inadequate design of the bowl handle this is a decent processor.
4,Nice & Quiet,I got this KitchenAid Food Processor to replace a more expensive unit that made enough noise to rattle my fillings. It has been a good sturdy choice! The way it fits together is a bit fussy so I did not give it 5 stars overall due to the design. I would definitely give it 5 stars for the great job it does and how QUIET it is.
3,No other blades for it!,"Of course it is good, it is a Kitchen-aid but I canceled my order. I discovered in time that this 7 cup model comes with a 2mm slicing blade and they do not make any other sizes to fit it! 2mm is pretty thin. The Cuisinart 7 cup comes with a 4mm slicing blade and you can order other sizes to fit. Come on Kitchen-aid! Such a nice processor with no options!"
2,Broke after one month but KitchenAid replaced it,"This food processor worked great for about a month until it would no longer turn off by the off button (we had to unplug it to stop it). Fortunately, KitchenAid has a great warranty service so we called them and they sent us a new, and better, unit in less than a week. So technically I would give the food processor itself a one star and KitchenAid customer service a five star."
2,I wish it were better,"I had great expectations when I purchased this processor, Kitchenaid had never let me down in the past. The base is impressively heavy, clean lines (easy to clean) and simple to operate. Unfortunately the work bowl handle is not very well constructed. If not locked onto the base very very gently it breaks, and there are several small pieces to break. I replaced the work bowl, paying more than half the price of the processor, and assumed I had to be very very careful, and it cracked anyway. Then the base part that turns the blade broke off, not all of it, it still runs, but if part is broken, how long before the rest does. I am very disappointed!"
2,Don't buy this processor,"This is a very quiet food processor and does a nice job. However, it won't last. Choose something more durable is my best advice. It is true the design is very bad for cleanliness. I figured out how to wash it with the small end of a bottle brush. However the plastic pieces on the bowl handle have broken more times than I can count. My husband is handy and up until now has been able to Mickey Mouse it back together, but this time it is unfixable. I have only had this food processor a little over a year. I would suggest staying away from this item."
2,Cover doesn't make a seal,"No matter how slowly and carefully I use this, my counters get spread with whatever is in the processor. The company refused to do anything about it, by the way. I'm through buying KitchenAid appliances."
1,Ours was defective and dangerous,"The blade is very sharp and is packed on top of the styrofoam boxing, without any covering or warning. My wife was unpacking the blender and was not aware that the cavity into which she inserted her finger contained the blade. The result was a painful and deep cut into the nail of her finger. Later we tried using the food processor and couldn't get it to shut off. Pressing the ""off"" button did nothing, and disconnecting it and then reconnecting it did not reset it. Fortunately Amazon has a good return policy, and this unit is out of here."
4,Hightec redneck,"works great and easy to use,my wife thought she had no use for a food processor,but now looks for new recipes just to have a reason to use this product."
3,Don't make your mom unhappy,"I am not an engineer, but I can work most electronics and put together any IKEA furniture or Lego set my children hand me. I was however intimidated with this appliance and the myriad of attachments it comes with. There are 3 cups, 3 blades, 3 slices, some extensions and they don't even all fit in the little plastic box that should hold them (and don't even think of removing them from the box or you will never get them back in). It won't even start if you don't have everything absolutely lined up and in place. It certainly looks like solid construction, but it is not something you will have laying around for a quick use. You will thing twice whether you absolutely need it before you bring the ""the monster"" out."
3,loveit,i got mine at lows its good it comes with a blade and dishck i used it for slising and choping the 12 cup dblade worcks
1,KITCHEN AID PROCESSOR,"I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT AND FOUND OUT WHEN I UNPACKED IT THAT IT CAN NOT BE USED IN AUSTRALIA. THE ELECTRICITY RATING IS 110V AND OURS HERE IN AUSTRALIA IS 240V. I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT SELLING SOMETHING TO ANOTHER COUNTRY THEY WOULD HAVE SENT ME ONE THAT I COULD USE.I HAVE PURCHASED OTHER KITCHEN AID PRODUCTS IN AUSTRALIA SO THEY OBVIOUSLY MAKE THEM FOR AUSTRALIAN STANDARDS. I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED.KitchenAid KFP7I5 7-Cup Food Processor, White"
4,Just the right size,This is our first food processor and the size is just perfect for our use.I just wished they made more different attachments for it.
4,Life and Time Saver,"I am a true vegetarian (no milk or eggs), so I have to cook for myself most of the time if I want to eat. I bought my KitchenAid back in May because I was tired of the same old food, and I now use it ALL the time. My recipe collection has increased ten-fold because I actually have a food processor now. As far as the machine goes, it is fast, quiet, and makes a banana ice cream that is out of this world delicious :) The only reason I gave it a four instead of five stars is because it is small. It is perfect for nights when I cook for only myself, but even cooking dinners for two (and especially three) might be more tricky. It is a little heavy (because it has a great motor), but it's easy to store and clean for the most part. I highly recommend this for single people, or for those who just need a small processor for basic small-scale chopping."
4,great machine for the money,Very pleased with the Kitchenaid food processor. I ended up buying the mini bowl and blade and it really makes a difference on many things I use the food processor for. Clean up is a breeze. Using the food processor is very easy and the job gets done quickly. For me the 7 cup is just the right size.
1,Worthless for slicing vegetables,"I am very sorry I bought this, based on the good reviews on Amazon. The blade is supposed to be reversible, but the skicing side practically shreds vegetables. I will go ahead and spend the money for a Cuisinart instead. Amazon: I wish you still had the Cuisinart 14 cup Limited Edition available."
2,Substandard Quality,"I've owned this for 18 months. It performed well for the first 16 months. Then the 'on' button would not work unless there was constant pressure on it; i.e. you have to hold it down all of the time. Today, two of the clips that lock the bowl in place broke off. The processor has only had moderate use and certainly not any heavy-duty chopping or shredding. I researched food processors thoroughly before I purchased and believed this to be the best buy. I am really disappointed in the quality."
4,Great value for the money,"The Good:A compact food processor that gets the job done.Great customer service (see issue below).Nice looking, typical of KitchenAid appliances (we bought the black one).Small footprint.The Not So Good:The base is heavy. If it won't be living on the counter, you'll probably tire of picking it up and putting it away. (But, in all fairness, a food processor of any quality will probably be heavy.)The bowl and cover are plastic and, like others have experienced here, the locking mechanism on mine has also broken after less than 3 months of use. (A quick call to KitchenAid took care of the problem...the food processor has a one year warranty and they are sending out a new bowl free of charge.)Summary: We've been pleased with our purchase so far (sans the locking mechanism issue...hopefully KitchenAid will fix this soon) and would buy this food processor again."
5,Love It!,"Theologically on, yet practical/applicable and easy to understand. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to get a deeper look into the world of Isaiah!"
4,Fair to good,"This is another good commentary in the NIV Application Commentary Series. I have really liked most of their other commentaries, but this one is only fair to good. The problem I have with this particular book is the overly conservative stance of the author. I think of myself as somewhat conservative, but this author is (at times) too conservative for my taste. This book is still good and I still read it for my weekly Isaiah Bible study lessons along side my other commentaries. It's a good addition to a library, but it probably should not be read as the only Isaiah commentary."
3,Norm M,"While this commentary would seem to be useful to a lay person in studying Isaiah, I found it not to be up to level of more detailed commentaries. A seminary or Bible College graduate may want to consider a more researched commentary."
3,"above average, but you sense mediocrity at times","Isaiah is a tough book to interpret, moreover it's tough to contextualize the book.It seems the author of this book struggled with exactly that.I've been using the book for a month now preaching through the daily devotional book to our church (covered about first 30chapter of Isaiah)...,I found ""original meaning"" part somewhat helpful, but most of the historical backgrounds can be found in most of the Study Bibles I own.""contemporary significance"" part does not seem to draw many of the good implications from the ""original meaning"" thus lacking in itsinspiration. ""contemporary significance"" tend to reduce the focus down to one or two central issues rather than covering the overall trajectory of the text.I still have half way to go in the book, so I hope to find greater content in the future."
4,Corduroy's Christmas Surprise,This is a very sweet book that is definitely worth adding to your Christmas book collection. My 2 1/2 year old loves it. The illustrations are fun and the story has a terrific moral - Corduroy changes his laundry list letter to Santa to focus on the more modest needs of his best friends.
2,"Nice story, but a departure from the original series","This struck me as ""Corduroy for the 21st century"". I love the original Corduroy books, and this one just has none of the feel of those, either in terms of narrative or in terms of illustration. Corduroy and his 4 silly animal friends do not interract with humans, but exist in some blissful upper middle class suburbia and participate only in gift giving as the meaning of the holiday. True, the bear we love does show his true self in the moment when he changes his Santa letter to ask only for gifts to his friends, but this is the only soft moment in an otherwise overly modern disney-like book. The sewn-on pocket Corduroy is replaced with a shallow pajama wearing pretender. I want my stoic old friend back..."
2,Cheesy but bearable,"This would have been decent (for an alien book) if it didn't happen to have such a colloquial voice. The plot was a tad bit cheesy but most of the time it was bearable. Then one of the main characters would say some completely idiotic and almost teenage remark and I would practically throw up. I do not recommend this book to anybody who likes good literature and an interesting story line. However, if you like alien books and you don't mind bad literature, maybe this is a good book for you. I have a wonderful friend who thinks this book is fabulous (I have no idea why). I hope you make a good decision! :)"
2,I like other Diana Palmer books much better,"I thought that this book was ok. I would not re-read it though. This book did not lack in action and suspence though, there was a lot undercover agents, secret missions, police forces, special agents , etc... in this book that it kept me reading it. Other than that, there was hardly any romance in it. I bought this book as a romance book and it really wasn't. The second story was better than the first. In the first story, Eb and Sallie had a bitter past together and they seemed just too forgive and forget very easily. Like in one day they were friends. Then came all the action with the drug lords and Eb ended up saving the day! The second story was rushed but I liked it better than the first. It played off of the first story, so it leads off where the other ended. So, you enojy the mercs, going undercover to catch a drug lord. I think that Mrs. Palmer should have just wrote this as one big book instead of two."
4,Palmer is always a good read.,"I always grab any Palmer book. It's nice to read about characters you already know & Palmer has a way of continuing a story line from one book to another, I love seeing how everyone is doing."
3,"Bound by Honor - two for oneReviewer: DSB Atlanta, Ga,","I enjoy reading and re-reading Diana Palmer. You always know love triumphs, good conquers evil, friends are like family and we live happily ever after. Not a bad idea.My one issue over the years has been that some of the characters are not consistant book to book."
2,Formulaic to say the least.,"First let me clarify: this is from the Media Scholar's wife. What's good about this book is its' price: it's cheap. You get two stories for the price of one. What the back cover doesn't tell you is that both stories are part of a series and are completely connected (which I, as a reader, don't love). I can live with that, though. Unfortunately, the similarities don't end there. Along with having the same characters, it has the same general plot. It is 100% predictable. The last chapter of the second story is there for the sole purpose of introducing another book, the next in the undisclosed series which- surprise- has the same plot! If you have a favorite plot and enjoy series/soap operas, then this book is for you. Another book by Diana Palmer, A Matter of Trust, is virtually the same as this one. Lucky me, I read them back to back. I most likely will not read another written by this author."
2,Waste of money,"Tiny!! I mean tiny!! I bought these to go with our daughter's new play kitchen we got her for Christmas, but when I opened the package, I was shocked at how small these are. Waste of money!"
1,Horrible! By it Locally,"I purchased two packages of this handle. One was fine, but the other screw-threaded size was too large to fit into its socket. The BIG PROBLEM however is that it was more expensive to ship it back for a refund than the items cost......buy it locally if you can. This was a useless expense."
2,Poor painting,"As an avid Muppet fan,I was sorely disappointed upon receiving this version of Gonzo. I was looking forward to his quintessential suit and luscious companion Camilla. But unfortunately upon arrival the paint was so badly done and peeling that it looked like Camilla was molting and Gonzo had some mold like grey over his normal coloring and chips on his nose and face and alot of the paint was off the mark. The horn has a very obvious break point from it's mold and the paint doesn't cover it. This company didn't do a very good job at what should be a classic and valued version of the Great Gonzo. Don't waste your money."
4,At least it was well written,"The story line may not have been the best, but I thought it was at least well written and kept me reading."
4,"Good read, weak in spots","Great story, a bit unbelievable in places. I came to really like the main character and truely felt for him in the anguish that he experienced. All characters were well defined and by the end of the book, I felt I knew them all well."
3,If you get over Kennedy parallel it's good political reading,"First Patterson book I read. While it turned me on to more of his work, I was left a bit empty by the end. Good courtroom action. The Kennedy parallel took a bit to beleive in but in the end it was an enjoyable read. Most of the campaign facts are right on as Patterson has done his homework."
1,Boring and Extremely Dry,"I, probably like most readers, am drawn to tried and true authors that I have enjoyed as a matter of course over the years. However, I feel as though I was misled on this one, in that I was dependant upon the fact that it was written by Richard North Patterson.Personally, I found the flashbacks far more interesting that the actual story line and found myself able to put this one down on a regular basis.Quite honestly, I have not, as of yet, finished the entire book and maintain that I will read it to its completion, but only in light of the fact that I don't have another, hopefully better, waiting in the wings!"
3,Not a page-turner,"Too much political rhetoric if you're hoping for a page-turner. I don't agree that this is one of his best. Of course, I did hang right in there through the very last paragraph!!"
1,Safer to avoid it,This book did keep my interest to some extent until the title character has an affair on his wife and lacks the communication skills with his lover to have her avoid what was a very descriptive abortion. This made my stomach turn and was as far as I was willing to go with this. It was just too unbelievable..his wife wants to leave him because running for President is too dangerous and his feminist girlfriend choses her career over a child?
4,Another Great One From The Master,"Richard North Patterson is one of America's best contemporary fiction writers. His character development is outstanding, and his ability to consistently tell a good story is impressive.True, there are times when this story kind of lags, however it is representative of the election process. I would bet that reporters and politicians alike become absolutely bored with day after day of the same thing...looking in the same place for another story. So to that end, Patterson conveys what it must feel like to be a part of all that. And he does it very, very well.The negative reviews are thoughtless. And as to the person who said this story is not thought-provoking, I say go back to your mindless world."
2,Not up to his usual standards...a difficult read,"As one of the other reviews said, only liberal P/C views are found in this book eg., no balance. I had trouble getting through this book, story drags along. I enjoyed his other books, hope the next is better."
2,Interesting insite into the politcal scene weak plot,One of Mr.Patterson's weakest book. Plot weak and at times very boring. Really no surprise at the ending but very predicatible. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Mr.Patterson's other books but this was a chore to finish.
2,A chore to read,"I finally was able to finish ""No Safe Place"" and found it to be a chore to read. Pattersons books have given me great joy to read in the past, however this book was an EXTREMELY difficult read. The content was fair, and the characters well developed, however it lacked the ability to catch my attention for any length of time. I would not suggest this book to anyone. Its only redeeming quality is the characters. The story, however, is just too drawn out."
2,"It was better than reading cereal boxes, barely.","If you are left of center and hate Republicans, the right to life and the NRA this could be the book for you. Although the plot and characters are still very thin as are the disguised ""real"" folks, i.e., VP Gore and Mort Zuckerman. Wait for the paperback."
2,Disappointing,This book was predictable from beginning to end with very little depth to the story. Disappointing for Richard North Patterson who usually writes some interesting stories.
1,"Boring, slow",I did enjoy the flashbacks - they told a good story. The current storyline about the campaign was very boring. It was all I could do to get through this one.
1,"Boring, slow, unexciting","Having enjoyed all his other books, I was really disappointed with this one. Kept putting it down and wishing it was finished. Only because I hate giving up on a book did I continue to the end..and was I glad to reach the last page! Sorry!"
3,"Not bad, but not up to his usual page-turning standards.","Maybe I'm just overloaded with politics with all the real-world melodrama lately, but this wasn't Richard North Patterson's best. ""Degree of Guilt"" is still one of the best legal thrillers I've ever read, and I read a lot of them. I found the plotting in this book incredibly obvious (was anyone surprised by any of the so-called relevations?), the characters cliches and the romance very harlequiny. Nothing wrong with that, but not my thing and not what I expected from RNP. So, not a horrible choice for a dull day, but wait for the paperback."
2,Flat and kinda boring,"This guy can write a good book. This isn't a good example of it. The whole thing is just too predictable. If this had been his first novel it would rate a 3 star maybe, but this is so much worse than other two novels I have read it deserves a lower rating. Better luck next time, RNP."
5,Compelling Political Thriller,"You don't have to be a Richard North Patterson fan to enjoy this exciting departure from his usual (and very good) courtroom dramas. I am an avid reader of political thrillers would rank this as one of the better ones of the year, up there with The Abduction by James Grippando."
5,"Excellent; much better writer than the ""other Patterson""","This is a book you can't put down. It's well written, well-researched, shows a grasp of the law and politics and the DC milieu. Most important, you really ""care"" about the characters. It works as a beach book, but it also makes you think about it afterwards; i.e., disturbing, thought-provoking yet entertaining. I recommend it highly."
5,Karen knows,I love to hear songs that where recorded at concerts and this CD has some of the best.If you are looking for that feel good CD get Ides of March.
2,Not so much ...,I got the album based on good reviews on Amazon -but what I am hearing is some not-so-impressive live versions of songs from well after their peak era.Live concerts are sometimes hard to enjoy if you were not actually at the event - this is one of those ...
4,Atardecer en Blues,"Los metales de Ides Of March fueron el gancho que me llevaron a interesarme en este grupo. El CD no me decepcionó.Buena versión en vivo de Vehicule con bonito manejo de la audiencia. Hay dos tracks que se salen del ""canasto"" con versiones bastante pop sin el uso de metales , que dan todo el tono de ser rellenos de las ""extended versions"":""You Wouldn't Listen "" y ""L.A. Goodbye""."
3,Mystery with an interesting twist.,"Catherine Aird's ""Parting Breath"" is another good mystery, thanks to the twist as to what ""26 seconds"" means. Along with these dying words from a college student, there is a sit-in on the University campus, and perhaps the letter naming Jane Austen's lover. Sloan and Crosby do alright here(Crosby is starting to become a good police detective)."
3,A Confusing Tale (from Catherine Aird?),"I am a huge Catherine Aird fan, but I was a bit disappointed with this book. I found it confusing, and the murderer and motive when they are relieved are ""way out there"". There was no build up or hints to that ending and I found that turned me off a bit. Sloane is still ""tongue-in-cheek"", and Crosby is still a brash young constable; Dabbe is still macabre (but we don't really see much of him in this story). This is a story about international intrigue that is played out in a university community. A young student is found stabbed in the quad of the university, and Sloane and Crosby take up residence on campus to find the killer. Not my favourite Aird, by any means, but she is a good writer, so it will not deter me from continuing to read her books."
4,A Lot Of Fun.,"This Disc clocks at 25 minutes. This would rate 5 stars but: There is an intro that is lost on non-Japanese speakers and the track This Year's Girl #1 is a repeat. If you're already a fan, you won't mind these 2 minor things. The other 3 tracks make this worth while. Since this one starts getting pricey, maybe it's a collector's thing rather than a first time listener's choice? Brigitte Bardot T.N.T. is the standout on the disc (excellent.)"
4,"Erotic, sexy, well told story","Rob Weaver is put on a ship by his father in order to break up his love for Angus. Robs good look continue to attract attention on board ship, but he jumps ship for fear of being sold into slavery.In Venice he comes upon a wealthy,lecherous, cut-throat from England, Damien. Once again his looks bring him favour, sex, and manipulation.I loved all the characters, expecially Lord Damien and the setting in Venice.erotic, sexy, well told story"
3,cute but ..,"I really loved this anklet when I first got it, but be careful! The leather stretches out and it's now WAY TOO big!"
5,It works better than novus,I used novus polish for years but these do have more grit variety to work with. They work well for my plastic solar lights that cloud up after a few years.
5,Great Product,I don't think you can buy anything bad with this name on it. It has always been an outstanding company and product.
2,Sensless acts of ego rather than sensless acts of beauty,"Synopsis is as follows: Cynical journalist feels guilty for being a cynic so decides to repent, by being cynical. Of course it is just an opportunity to get into print everything he has ever thought and every letter he has ever written. Therefore satisfying his quite frightening ego. A man of talent would have the ability to convert the everyday into a book, a journalist can merely report, and unfortunately does not know when to stop.However, it was enjoyable in its pointlessness and no doubt gave Queenan the autodidactic comfort in knowing a tree has been destroyed to immortalise his senseless ego further."
2,Enough already !,"At first I liked this book, but he just kept throwing the same jokes out over and over again. I do not think Queenan is very good at writing about himself. I kept thinking how self absorbed he was. I've enjoyed Joe's articles in magazines, but not this book. I couldn't finish it, after a few chapters it was as repulsive as fingernails on the blackboard, or Howard Stern, or Susan Sarandon!"
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT,"I've read and enjoyed each of Queenan's books, a state of affairs that probably made the failure of this one all the more acute. It's a misfire, plain and simple -- Queenan had one idea, his sudden conversion to virtue, and then proceeded to beat it into the ground. Buyer beware -- if you're a Queenan fan -- or a humor fan -- stay away."
5,Smells delicious,"It's a really nice thing to have a familiar scent of the outdoors with a kick of ginger in your room. I bought these primarily to keep moths away but I might have to buy more because they smell so good. Only thing I'm concerned about if it is so strong it will stay with the clothing while I wear it, but common sense would dictate if this should occur it would only be a faint scent and it's still rather refreshing. Recommended."
2,Buyer beware!,"If you are looking for the bonus remix disc, please look further. I ordered this twice and recieved other editions. I contacted several sellers and they did not have this one in stock. I know it has to be out there somewhere. Good luck and happy hunting!"
4,Talk Parade,"Perhaps someone else could say better things about Jimi.The dvd is perfect,in good condition.Please don't get me wrong,the dvd arrived in good condition and the color is so nice and there are interesting persons who give their credits to Jimi."
5,About the problems in the DSP book,"Sir, Please send the solutions manual of the book Digital Signal Processing : Principles, Algorithms, and Applications by John G. Proakis, Dimitris G. Manolakis. I am referring this book for Under graduate students. It will be of great help to me. Prof. G.P.Kadam. H.O.D. electronics & communication Engg. K.L.E. Society's college of Engg. & Tech. Udyambag, Belgaum. 590 008"
1,Horrible Book,"I am a 3rd year Engineering student and I find this book to be absolutely horrible. The text is confusing and the examples are horrible. They do not do any numerical examples worth reading. One of the worst textbooks I have ever had to use. If you are forced to use it, I am sorry. This book focuses more on theory then on numerical examples, which is what most students are tested on."
5,Conciousness Expansion,"This is a truly amazing piece of art. Totally improvised and incredibly rich and deep, this CD gets played in our cars, house and anywhere else we can get it going on a daily basis. It is best enjoyed as a whole, allowing the listener to truly transcend on a sonic journey. I would recommend this for fans of Shpongle, Bluetech or any progressive ambient music. The artists Jamie Janover, Michael Travis and Aaron Holstein have created a wondrous thing."
5,So beautiful and relaxing!,"I listen to this CD every day. It is so amazingly deep and powerful. You can connect to this music on so many levels, and it inspires feelings of peace and happiness. Truly good music! Who needs lyrics when you have Michael Travis, Jamie Janover, and Aaron Holstein?"
3,¡Cuidado! The answer key is a separate book!,"Be careful when buying this workbook. If you buy it new you'll probably get the answer key packaged with it. If you buy it used, you probably won't. You may have to order ""Answer Key to SAM for Conexiones: Comunicacin y cultura,"" by Eduardo Zayas-Bazán, separately. Ask the seller if the answer key (a slim, turquoise book) is included."
5,One of the best audiobooks - EVER!,"I borrowed the audiobook from the library, but my family loved it so much that I had to buy it. James Avery did a terrific job reading from this simply wonderful book. We laughed so hard that tears rolled down our faces. My seven-year old loved it as did her parents and grandparents.The next time you go on a long family car trip leave the DVDs at home and bring this audiobook (and another fabulous audiobook by the same author: The Watsons Go to Birmingham 1963). The entire family will be entertained - and learn more about America during the Depression."
4,I couldn't put this book down.,"I have picked up Bud, Not Buddy on several occasions and have always put it back down because the cover does not appeal to me. In a search to find something to share with my students, I decided to give it a try. I couldn't put it down! The story is told from the perspective of Bud, a ten-year-old orphan. The voice of Bud is true to a ten-year-old boy, and his dialect and mispronunciation of words are endearing both to adolescents and adults. Students love his rules to live by - many of them are probably similar to some of their own rules to live by. Bud, Not Buddy reads like a fairy tale. It has a sad beginning, is full of humor and sadness, but in the end, the reader is left smiling. The book also provides some historical insight into the depression era in a format that students are likely to remember. I consider this to be a great extra!"
5,Excellent must-read!!!!!,"I purchased this book for my son's monthly book report assignment; he's in 6th grade and it's sometimes a challenge to have him sit and read. But, ""Bud, Not Buddy"" was so engaging from the moment he picked it up. The book is narrated from a child's perspective and it is non-stop interesting, fun, funny and heart-breaking. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a wholesome, historical read."
3,"Bud, Not Buddy","I loved the Bud, Not Buddy book because I really liked the way Christofer Paul Curtis tells the story. He also describes well the characters. The only thing that I didn't like is that sometimes the book gets real boring... It starts talking about other things which they don't interest you...I LOVED the ending of the book... I thought it was real sweet! When I started reading it I thought it was boring, til' I got to the ending which I loved. I thought that the part that he stays in his mothers room without knowing was realy sweet! I loved it! And I also thought really funny the part that he always says that his name is not Buddy, but yes Bud!!!I think that 10 or 11 year old readers should read the book, and also they need to be really patient because the story goes really slow...But I sugest the book for all types of people 'cause it teaches you a lot of things!"
5,Bud Not Buddy,"In this book, Curtis was able to capture the good side of having courage to go ahead with one's plans and ideas. Curtis also used lots of adjectives to describe the scenes of the story. By that, we feel as though we are living the story while we read it. The book tells the story of an orphan boy, who decides to go looking for his father, after seing a picture of Herman E. Calloway that his mother left him. While looking for his father, he goes through lots of messy things and adventures. One part I liked, was when he had his first kiss with Deza Malone and when he finally met Herman. Some parts I thought were boring, such as the parts in which he kept on remembering what happenned to him in the past. I only think, that it has some hard words. I think kids from 10 years old on, will be able to read it, and also people that like living and feeling what the characters feel. I think it also make's people curious about what will happen. Bud Not Buddy is a very good book!Micaela."
4,Character for Sale!,"How much do you think Bud Caldwell costs? We will give you Bud for the perfect price-$350.00. Why do you think Bud costs this much? He will dazzle you with his outstanding manners! Folks, you better get used to hearing ""Yes ma'am"" and ""Yes sir"" because you will hear that a lot once you buy Bud. Next, he may be small and scrawny on the outside, but the inside counts most. For example: his heart is full of love and joy! As part of this special offer, we can include his awesome suitcase, and Bud Caldwell's Rules and Things to have a Funner Life and make a Better Liar out of Yourself book. He shows his great personality through his funny actions. When ever he disagrees with someone or something he always says, "" you can kiss my wrists if you think I'm gonna do that."" Buy Bud now! And remember, his name is Bud, Not Buddy!"
4,Quoteables,"In Bud, Not Buddy Christopher Paul Curtis does a great job to crete a dynamic character, Bud. First, Bud changed to act braver. Now, he never hesitates to act, even if he might not do the right thing. Also, Bud changed to act more intelligently. In the book, he put together clues to find his father in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Last, Bud changes to act more polite towards the end of the book. He starts to use ""sir"", ""ma'am"", ""please"", and ""thank you"". Bud changes to become a better character. Overall, Bud, Not Buddy is a superior read, and we reccomend it to 3rd to 7th graders."
1,The great review,It was kinda sad but it was a really good book and it was a easy read I read it in just four days and I couldn't stop reading it
3,bud not buddy this is the lamest book eva,man i had to read this book for a group discussion and even though it had some funny parts it was lame the plot made no sense what so ever and we had to read it.the ending was way far fetched and it didnt make it for realism.so i dont recommend this book
3,The Suit Case Blues,"I learned a lot of new things that I did not know at first. I liked the book, but I would not really want to read it again. At first I thought it was going to be a boring book. It was, at first, but then it started to get a little better. By the time I had finished the book it got boring again. I thought the plot of the story was to find his father. I disliked and I like the book. I disliked it, because it had some very slow and boring parts. I liked it, because in the parts that where not boring they had there shine. One related book is The Watson's go to Birmingham. This is related because they are written by the same author. That's my review."
3,"Bud, Not Buddy","Bud is a little boy who lost his mom, and decides to look for his father. He goes through lots of adventures. Will he find his mom???Will he find his dad???We liked the book and the part that we liked the most was when he went to Hooverville. Some parts of the book, are very boring, but sometimes it's very cool.Mariana and Martha"
2,A not pretty good book...,"I read the book ''Bud not Buddy`` and i thoght that it wasent a very good book because it dont have exciting parts, so if you are one of does that like books with excitement dont read this book. But, if you are one of does that like very light books please go on and read it."
3,Bud not Buddy,This book is about an orfan who runs away to find his father. He travels with his friend but they get seperated. He meets lots of nice people and some not so nice.
5,One Great Book,This book is one of the best books Iv'e read. My favorite part is when Bud gets locked in the shed.This is a funny book.Bud has no family and doesn't like the foster homes he's living in.He runs away from his foster home and goes to Grand Rapids to find his dad. He meets somebody along the way. His name is Lefty Louis. He gives Bud a ride to Grand Rapids. Will Bud find his dad or not?
4,this book was good but could be better.,"This about a boy without parents. So he has to live in a foster home, And he gets trnsfered alot. He's a young black boy who later on likes jazz music. It helps him get rid of some of his pain. That's what i like most about the book."
3,A Great Way to Learn About the Depression!,"The book Bud, Not Buddy is a great story filled with lots of wonderful knowledge which young readers can subconsiously absorb. In this book a young boy named Bud sets out from the Home to find his father. Bud can show you how it was to be a young black boy during The Depression and introduces you to many famous people and places. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a quick and easy introduction to The Depression."
3,"Bud, not Buddy","Bud, Not Buddy was an ok book. I think it was a little boring in the end how they dragged on and on. I think that Christopher Paul Curtis brought in a lot of characters, but left them behind before we really got to know them and understand them."
4,"Bud, Not buddy","I enjoyed reading this book. I liked reading the sstory becuase it gave me some future lying tips. I found that Bud (the main character in the book), was very brave and perserverent because even though some bad things occured during his adventure, he still stuck to it and kept going on. I would recamend this book alot, for someone who likes sad and funny books."
3,Gone,"1... This book is about a boy who cant stand to be called buddy. He would rather be called bud. He lives in an orpanage, and him and his friend get adopted and goes and lives with the Amoses, thier so mean to him, they made him sleep in the shed. He gets out an runsaway and takes his special suitcase with him that he takes everywhere. Hes looking for his father or any relatives he might now.2... This book reflects on me by being thankfull for everything i have and for the place i live in and my blessings.3...The story element that i choose to use is characterization. Beacuse he awlays is taking his suitcase and that suitcase is very special to him beacuse he has pictures of his ""so called dad"".4... I give this book a 3 beacuse it isnt as good as it looked and i dont quite like reading about that kind of realistic fiction."
5,Great adventure for anyone,This book had just enough twists to keep you turning and rooting for Bud. As Bud tries to find his family while struggling through the drepression on an adventure across Michigan it is hard not to keep turning the pages.
5,Great book!,"This is one of my all time favorite books! This is about a boy on the search for his father. Since his mother died, he was in an orphanage, but then he ran away. He meets new people and gets an idea of who is father is from a flyer he keeps with him. Later he decides to go to another town to find his supposed father. While he walks to the other town, a driver picks him up and brings him to his house for the night. Then he takes bud to the next place of where this band that Bud's supposed father plays in will be. It is an excellent book!"
5,A wonderful read-aloud!,"I read to my 7th grade students every day of the week, and Bud, Not Buddy has been a hit with them. The book certainly has humor, but it also has very emotional scenes which obviously touched my students'hearts. The only thing I don't like about this book is that it will be difficult to choose a read-aloud to follow it!"
4,Bud Not Buddy,I really liked bud not buddy it was sad in some parts and funny in the other I have also read the Watsons go to Birmingham by this author that was pretty good too
3,IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD BOOK,a lot of schools are reading this book.it is about a boy trying to make it in life and finding his famous father. it is a little sad but funny at moments andy age im sure would be able to read this book i would rate it a PG book a little bit of mean and foul language like crap and damnit. but great book.
4,This book is a spectacular book.,"This book started out with a boy named Bud and his mother.Bud's mother dies and Bud stays in a boys home. There he makes new friens.ONe day bud is found a new family.Bud finds trouble in his new home on the first night.His new family makes him sleep in the barn.Bud gets hurt in the barn trying to escape from the barn.When he does escape from the barn he sets out to look for his father. What Bud finds on this adventure is surprising. He does find his family, but not the one he was expecting. Read this award winning Newbery book. It truly deserved the award."
4,a must read book,I liked this book because of the way it is set and what is going on.I also liked this book because it makes me laugh a lot.My favorite character was Bud because he was very funny and brave.I also liked Bud because of what he did to Tom Amos when he left the house.My favorite part of the book was when he poured the hot water on Tom Amos's lap. The reason why that is my favorite part is because it reminds me of something one of my friends did. I think it was funny when he thought that Lefty Lewis was a vampire in the car going down the street. One more reason why i liked the book was because when he set a goal he would not give up until he accomplished it. I thought that the ending was very good.
5,"GOOD BOOK, GOOD BOOK","I like this book because it sounds so real and its not just one adventure he goes on, but alot. It was hard to put down. Through this book he was searhing for his dad. And when he finally finds who he thinks is his dad, it turns out to be more than that!After you read this book you feel like you know him."
5,soulmates over time,"Bud, and Ellen Foster are soulmates! Having taught kids for 30 years, this is the type of realistic literature that makes READERS."
4,A very good book,"This was one of the books we had to read this year for English Studies. It's a realistic look at the 1930's (with extreme poverty and families just barely surviving) and a foster child, Bud (not Buddy) Caldwell. Bud is convinced that a certain musician is his father, and sets out to find him with hardly a clue. On the way, Bud has some funny things happen to him, but some of those things are kind of boring, and have little to do with Bud finding his dad, unfortunately. The ending (which is surprisingly happy) is better than the middle part, which slows the book down at times. If you like novels set in the past that still have something to say about today's world, then I would recommend Bud, Not Buddy. Two other novels we read that I also liked were An Audience for Einstein and Flowers for Algernon, a classic novel."
3,"Close, But No Cigar","... Although the story was entertaining in an unusual sort of way, I would have enjoyed it were I two years younger. (I just turned twelve.) Bud (not Buddy)'s story is definitely interesting...but I think it could've been a little longer. I'll admit I got into the story as it went along, and even started to care what happened to Bud-which only happens when I'm either very deeply into a story, which I was not, or when an author is very good-but the ending left me deeply disappointed. Still, I think it was an, as Bud would say, ""awful good try."""
3,This Book Was Slammin,I liked this book because it was about him settin out to find his dad. He has a poster of his dad band. It was sad when his mom died and he got tookin out of his house in to foster care.I liked the main character Bud because he never gave up he would go to the library to find thing bout his dad.He was not sacred of anything.The best part of the book was when Bud told Mr.Calliway his mom name.and Bud was Mr.Calliway grandson.
4,Outstanding in every way,"I enjoyed this outstanding book because it was humerous the way Bud,the main character,did his thinking.I like him because he din't think or act like normal people.The book is about a 10 year old orphan kid looking for a man he thought was his father.So he set out on the road to the town his father was suppose to be. The best part of the book is when he walks up to the man and says ""You're my dad"". The ending of the book was very good because it tied everything together!"
3,Awesome book!,I love bud not buddy. It is a heart warming story. I love the book!¡I am a mystery guest!!!x$&&(!((_:())):_)&)_:;:)96 :)):==)?/##)/)/##:
5,for a special student,I ordered this so i could give a copy to one of my special students who loved this book when we read it together at school in a small group.
5,"Take an Adventure with Bud, Not Buddy","The story, ""Bud, Not Buddy"" by Christopher Paul Curtis, is a great book for children and adults. This book was on many reading lists, and also had a ""yearling newberry award"", so I decided to give this book a try. As I read the book, I could not put it down, and I guarantee that the same thing would happen to you. ""Bud, Not Buddy"" is about a boy (an orphan) who takes an adventure from Flint, Michigan to Grand Rapids, to meet his father, Herman E. Calloway, who is the world's best jazz musician. Bud meets many new people along the way,who help him. Will Bud find his ""father"", if Herman E. Calloway is actually his father? Find out in this adventurous and unforgettable novel!"
5,A Kid's Review,"Bud not Buddy is a great book. I read it in my Language Arts class. I couldn't stop turning the pages. It was like a movie on paper. I just couldn't stop laughing. Not all of the book is funny though. It was emotional, it can make you cry, oh, and did I mention that it is hilarious? Bud is really brave. He was determined to find his father. I couldn't do that. I would recommend it to anybody who loves funny books."
5,A Kid's Review,"Bud, Not Buddy is an amazing book. If you read it you will not be able to put it down. It will be like your fingers are glued to the pages. The story is about a young boy named Bud...not Buddy. Bud is a boy from an orphanage on a search for his dad. He is hilarious! He follows rules on how to make a better liar out of yourself and have a funnier life. The end of the book has a great surprise."
3,"Bud,Not buddy book report","Bud, Not Buddy By: Christopher Paul CurtisThis book is about a ten year old boy named Bud. He lives in an orphanage he calls the home. He gets moved to different places in his life.My favorite part is when Bud tells the story of Bugs. Bud's best friend gets a cockroach stuck in his ear.I thought the story was a little long at times.Remember, always tell the truth.This book report is by:Claire"
4,"Bud Caldwell, A Boy in Search of his Father","This book is about a 10 year old boy named Bud. He does not have a mom because she died when he was 6, now he lives in an orphanage. Then he was adopted by the Amos family. The Amoses son, Todd, stuck a TICONDEROGA pencil all the way to the R in Bud's nose! OUCH!!! Then they fought, causing the Mr. Amos to put Bud in a shed. Bud escaped in order to find his father, who he thinks is Herman E. Calloway, a famous jazz musician. When he finds his father it turns out that Herman is someone different, someone totally unexpected. I gave the book 4 stars because the ending wasn't as interesting as the rest of the book. I think Christopher Paul Curtis is a good author because he describes his characters really good. Except for the ending, this book is the best!"
4,Naruto volume 7,"This book is an action packed book it will really get you moving. My opinion is, if you are looking for a action packed book choose Naruto volume 7. This is a fabulous book so check it out at your nearest library or at your school. Note:This book is part of a series."
2,My 10 year old did not like it,"My 10 year old daughter (an avid reader) read this book as part of her 4th Grade book club. She wrote the following review:I would not recommend Bud Not Buddy because I feel the more of this book you read, the worse it gets. I also don't think it has a great story line. I feel the character is hard to relate to. My least favorite part was when Bud walked into the log cabin and confronted the band. I also didn't like it because there were cliffhangers but they did not have you hanging on the edge of your seat. Overall, I did not like it."
3,"Bud, Not Buddy-Book Review","I think that Bud, Not Buddy is a litle bit nice and has some parts that are mysteries. Bud is one boy that is 10 years old and lives in an orphanage. He ran away from the orphanage and from some houses that he 'lives'. I think that's it."
3,"book review from bud remember, not buddy.","This story is about one boy whose name is Bud,Not Buddy. That is what his mom said: ""Don't let anyone call you Buddy"". Bud lost his mother when he was 6 year old so he went looking for his father.If you like stories with adventure and drama you will like this story very much.Bud,Not Buddy, by Christopher Paul Curtis.nathalia"
5,"Bud, Not Buddy","This book is the best book you'll ever read. The best part is when he finds his grandfather. At First he thought it was his dad, but it wasn't. It's sad, funny and so good. I'll give you one hint about the boy he's an orphan."
3,"Martha's Review of Bud, Not Buddy","""Bud, Not Buddy"" is about an orphan. Before she died, his mother told Bud not to allow anyone to call him Buddy. Buddy, according to her, was a dog's name. Bud is adopted, but quickly escapes. He decides to walk to Grand Rapids from Flint where he lives. Bud carried around an old, beat-up suitcase which contained all his memories from his mothers. Along the road Bud meets Lefty Lewis who takes him to Grand Rapids in his car. Bud wants to go to Grand Rapids because that is where he thinks his father is according to some fliers his mom had saved which bear his name. Is Herman Bud's father? Read the book to find out. This book is for readers who think living perilously is fun."
1,Boring!!!!,This book was one of the most boring books I read in my whole life. i read it for my ESL class. This book just talks about history and not a lot of adventure. So thats what i think about it.
4,"Bud, Not Buddy review","Bud Not Buddy was an interesting book, though if I would be able to choose another book to read, I would not read the book again. I think it is really surprising in some parts, so I think that if I did read it again, it would not be a cliffhanger. This book was great for a project because it was historical fiction. DON'T read this book today! Just kidding, this book was pretty good, just don't read it twice!"
4,A book you can't put down!,"This was a GREAT book. I think it might have needed a bit more exitment, but it was a really really good book. I would say its one of the best books I have read"
3,This Book Was Slammin,I liked this book because it was about him settin out to find his dad. He has a poster of his dad band. It was sad when his mom died and he got tookin out of his house in to foster care.I liked the main character Bud because he never gave up he would go to the library to find thing bout his dad.He was not sacred of anything.The best part of the book was when Bud told Mr.Calliway his mom name.and Bud was Mr.Calliway grandson.Bud got a recorder and learned how to play and they let him in the band.
4,Awesome,"I liked the book called Bud, Not Buddy. It was the best book I have ever read. Christopher Paul Curtis is a very good writer, and I can't wait to read The Watsons Go to Burmingham."
4,Against All Odds,"Wow, this was a great story. Bud is a remarkable young man. At 10 years old he goes through many obstacles to get to the man he thinks is his dad. The story takes place during the great depression and gives many situations were Bud was in trouble but was given a lending hand by some folks. We were able to see the story through the eyes of a ten year old. There was nothing that was going to stop Bud, even though he had been through many hard times, especially during the 1930 where many blacks were dealing with racism Bud did not let that bring him down. Some of Buds nave thinking and beliefs helped him along the way. He finally reaches the man he set out to find and realizes that its not his father but it is the grandfather. It was a great story with a lot of detail with the things Bud had to go throw. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it."
4,Journey of an African American boy in the Depression,"The best thing about BUD NOT BUDDY is the portrait it paints of life during the Great Depression. Freight train hopping, Hoovervilles, bread lines, labor organizers, jazz bands and other components of the 1930's are all given a place. The plot is basically a journey as the orphaned Buddy makes his way from the children's welfare system to being united with a long missing relative with some adventures along the way. Good choice for upper elementary and middle school students looking for a historical or multicultural novel."
4,Six exclamation points!!!!!!,"Another strong, wise, intense child protagonist in the vein of Blossom Culp. It feels misleading to make such a comparison because they're two very different characters in two rather different situations, but both face poverty, adversity and absent parents with beyond-their-years intelligence, resourcefulness, dry wryness and depth.Bud has a list hundreds of entries long titled ""Bud Caldwell's Rules and Things for Having a Funner Life and Making a Better Liar Out of Yourself,"" enumerating the vast amounts of wisdom he's accumulated in 10 short years -- like ""Rules and Things Number 83: If an adult tells you not to worry, and you weren't worried before, better hurry up and start 'cause you're already running late.""There are lots of examples of man's inhumanity to man on Bud's perilous journey, but, hearteningly, just as many demonstrations of altruistic kindness. There's a very satisfying ending -- it's a great book from start to finish."
4,Summer School Reading at it's Best!,"Our 5th/6th grade summer school class read Bud, Not Buddy during the summer session and collectively wrote a review of the book: This book was a great book about brave, Bud Caldwell. It contained adventure, sadness, comedy and bravery. It was sad at times, but also made us laugh. We liked the character's names like Steady Eddie and Doo-Doo Bug. If you like adventure, reading about Bud Caldwell's search for his father is the book for you."
5,The best book ever!!!,I luv this book!!!! It is one of my top 10 books to reccomend at all times !!! It is a very funny yet sad at times... I read this book in 5th grade as a book report book and this year we have to read a newberry award book and some people didn't know what to choose so i told tham to read this book and they told me that they enjoyed it a lot!!! I have a friend that doesn't like to read at all and after she read this she said it is the best book ever!!! So i recommend it to kids 9 and up!!
5,Wonderful Novel,"Bud, Not Buddy is an amazing book. I love using it in the classroom. It's a great representation of Michigan during the Great Depression. I could not put the book down because I did not know what Bud was going to do next!"
5,a phenomenal novel!,"This book is about a boy named Bud, not Buddy, who is trying to find his real family. It is extremely well written, and the characters(based on the author's real family members), are well developed. If you like a great story about a young man discovering his destiny, you will love this book! It is all age appropriate."
4,liked this book alot,"My son had to read this over the summer. He is going into 7th grade. It started a bit slow, but by the end he was hooked. I would recommend it for 12 year old kids."
5,Great Service!!,"I ordered audio CD Bud, Not Buddy for students at the school where I teach - not only was it a good price, but it arrived two days later! The students that I work with who are learning disabled were able to listen to the book on the CD and stay up with their classmates. Thank you, Amazon.com!!"
4,A fine and challenging middle school read,"Bud, Not Buddy (Readers Circle (Laurel-Leaf))is a fine read for strong middle school readers. For my children, it was more difficult on both an academic and emotional level. It presents the life of an orphaned child with much of its cruel and lonely elements. This was too painful for my two children adopted from across the world."
3,"Solid, but tries too hard","Christopher Paul Curtis (THE WATSONS GO TO BIRMINGHAM) comes back at us now with his second effort, which, unfortunately, doesn't nearly match the authenticity and honesty of his first one. Bud, his 10 year old protagonist, veers in voice from six to adult, sometimes in the midst of the same page. And Curtis seems sometimes to be trying too hard to find pins on which readers can hang their hats: he thanks every young adult author of note in his acknowledgements, writes a children's librarian character who's just shy on the goodness scale from Mother Teresa, manages to work in the Negro baseball leagues AND Hoovervilles AND the early labor organizing days of the Pullman's union AND black jazz...I found myself exhausted by it all. What gets lost is Bud, a kid who, without all the bells and whistles, has a hell of a story to tell."
2,run away Bud,"Bud, the main character, is an orphan. When his mother was alive, she kept posters of a musician named Herman E. Calloway. Bud thinks this is his father, which he never met. WHen he goes to meet Calloway there was a surprise. It wasnt a very good book and the surprise ending wasn't much of a surprise. Oh well, you might like it."
3,Uh its OK,"It's an ok book to pass the time away, but if your teacher makes you read it and makes you write a review for a grade the it is a GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!!!! If you have read every other book you might as well read this one. But I wouldn't recommend it to any one younger than 7!"
3,this book was ok... buddy,"This book was alright it gave much detail, sometimes too much, and it was a little on the boring side. The end was confusing too. If your looking for good book to read, I suggest you read eragon.(...)"
4,Whose the Boss?,"Like a typical first grader, Junie B. cannot wait to eat out of her brand new mail ordered lunchbox. However, she gets into trouble for sneaking a peak when students in Room 1 do not open their lunchboxes outside of the cafeteria. Just when Junie B. begins to bring her lunch, everyone else wants to eat prepared ones like the hoagies because they are better. She then wants one of her classmate's cookies from the lunchroom but instead Junie B. finds out the snack lady from last year works in the Cafeteria. She gets to be her helper, but who is really the boss? Children can see how Junie B. writes in her journal and corrects her spelling as she goes. This would be a great book to read aloud before or after lunchtime. Junie B. you make lunch fun!"
2,Good if you like books,"A creative book, but I thought only the beginning was any good, the rest just got boring. There were some good parts, like when Bud gets revenge on a person who lies to him. A little bit of adventure, and some good parts. If you like books (...), you'll like it. Since i dont like books about non-fiction, i didnt like this one."
1,Boring book,"I didn't like this book because it is boring but also I don't like books that tell about real life. I like stories about things that can never happen, like monsters or magic, space or anything like that. I think that people that like books that describs about someones life adventure will like this book."
1,Not My Buddy,"By Peyton MowerI read this book for school. It had a slow start, lots of holes, and a bad ending. I kept reading, hoping it would get better, but it didn`t. This was the worst book in the world"
1,horrible,"My 5th grade teacher made us read it. I wanted to put the book down from the 1st page. It was very bad and extrmeley boring. I dont know any book as dull as this. I mean its interesting for a boy to look for his real father but on his way there is no excitment. I'm the kind of person that reads the whole book but I couldn't stand this one. I had to finish. The story had one of the most boring plots. It was just utterly horrible. I would not reccomend this book for any reader, unless your a boring person. But I don not know why the poeple rated this book all 5 stars. This book does not deserve 5 stars. It doesn't deserve even one star. Dont ever read this. It's horrible!"
1,DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Learn about the world of jazz! If you want to know read ""Bud not Buddy""The story begin's in 1936 in Flint,Mechigan.Bud is a simple boy that is ten years old.Bud never met his father but it seems a miracle happens and he sees his father's photo at a jazz band.The story is of Bud looking for his father."
5,Definetly a Newberry Winner,"Christopher Paul Curtis writes a great book in Bud Not Buddy. The book is about the orphan Bud Caldwell who lives in a orphanage the ""Home."" After he gets in trouble at one of the temporary homes he goes on the lam. This is his story of how he finds his missing father and finding a permanent home. This story is touching and funny at the same time. This is a definetly a must read for young adults."
4,The Best Book in the World!!!,"In the book Bud, Not Buddy; Bud is a very important character in the book.He is an orphan at a gruop home for kids because his father had left his mother when he was born and soon after that she passed away. If you like adventurous, relaxing books. Then this is the right book for you! One of my favorite quotes he says in the book is "" when you make your mind to do something, hurry up and do it, if you wait you might talk yourself out of what you wanted in the first place!"""
5,"Bud, Not Buddy is a winner!","I have to say when I first started reading this book, as an assignment, I was less than enthusiastic about it. Once I actually became engaged in the book I loved it! Buddy, is such an amusing and energetic character that it is hard to keep your distance. He lives by a series of rules (example-Rules & Things #83- If an adult tells you not to worry, and you weren't worried before, then you better hurry up and start 'cause you're running late), which often introduce or end an episode in the book and they were hilarious, probably one of my favorite things about the book, they showed insight into life & love & the hearts of children everywhere"
5,"Bud, Not Buddy","Bud, Not Buddy is a touching book about a young foster child. After his mother's death he finds a flyer of a musical group ""The Dusky Devastators of the Deprssion"" and is convinced that one of the men in the group is his father. Now he is determined to leave his foster home and travel across the US to find this man who must be his father. Along the way he has many scary as well as funny adventures. Will he make it to his destination? And what will be there when he gets there? Read this great book to find out."
2,run away Bud,"Bud, the main character, is an orphan. When his mother was alive, she kept posters of a musician named Herman E. Calloway. Bud thinks this is his father, whom he never met. When he goes to meet Calloway, there was a surprise. It wasn't a very good book and the surprise ending wasn't much of a surprise. Oh well, you might like it."
2,"Boring, little action, good plot",Bud not buddy has very litlle action. Just about the only action in the book was when he got trapped in the shed and when he was trying to get on the train west. This book was very boring because there were too many descriptions. The reason why I gave the book any stars is because it had a good plot. I mean who doesn't want to read a book about a kid trying to find his grandpa.
1,"Boring, Not Bud Or Buddy",The BORING story about a boy that search his dad after being locked in an old shed on the land of his current foster family.How??Runnig and going to Horville what's going to repent (do not)read the BORING book
1,"Bud not, Buddy",I didnt like this book thats my opinion i thought it was boring no adventure no suspense and comic things.Bud is an orphan boy is mother died and he tries to find is father that appeared on a flyer he knew is mom left a hint so he could find out where is father is.He visited many places and towns to find him.The book is old in old times i mean i didnt like it because it needs creativity of the author like mopre adventure and stuff.
2,Y-a-w-n-,"I try to find books that children would find INTERESTING.This one is a ""yawner"".Some of the grammar is bad .. I guess to simulate how the boy would talk.The poor grammar doesn't add to the story. In fact, I don't know why authors do this. It's just aggravating, and slows the reader down.Historical fiction, but a dull story.Sorry."
3,"bud,Not Buddy",In this book I had likes and dislikes. I liked the bookBecause it did a good job Explaining what is going on.I did not like it because it took place during the depression and I dont really like history that much but over all it was a really great book.Well the only part that I liked but i could not understand was when Bud gotto be put in a new home and get got in a fight with the little boy named Todd and then todd tryed to tell his mom a lie and Bud had to sleep in a shed.The most vivid thing to me was the shed because it tells you everything about it like how spooky it is and what everything looks like inside another thing is when he sees the six men siting in a circle and he said tha one was his dad.
5,Christopher Paul Curtis does it again.,"I have read many books in my life, but the best book I read was Bud not Buddy.the main character Bud has a strong dislike to the name buddy. Bud a unique character thinks that his Father is the famous fiddler player on the newspaper. Bud dicides to take a risk across the state to find out. On the way he meets some friends who help him but is not pleased when he makes it there. This adventurous book is appropriate for anyone from ages 9 and up."
4,EZ's Review,Bud Not Buddy is my favorite book because its very funny.Scary things happen in this book like hes mom dies plus he tries to findhis dad but everyone he ran into treated him badly.Thats is one reason I don't like this book. All the adults treat him wrong and badly. But other than that the book is good. My favorite character of the book is Bud because he is the main character of the book. I will recommend someone else to get this book. One question I have after reading this book is can I meet the author?
5,Very thoughtful and helpful clarification of forgiveness.,"This discussion of forgiveness and its relationship to the five stages of grief is very helpful to anyone seeking to resolve conflicts in relationships past and present. The book is useful in helping the reader discover deeper issues of unforgiveness and gives careful and helpful guidance as to how to resolve these issues. As a professional psychotherapist and Christian counselor, I found the insights meaningful and the entire book encouraging as to the hope it offers for healing hurts in relationships. Parents, partners, friends, spouses, teachers, counselors and others will benefit from the sage counsel and practical advice."
5,A book that heals oneself and others. Life changing!,"The Five Stages of death and dying are applied here to help one get with the healing of self, as well as others, in order to Forgive. Even better,in the process of reading this book, one is given lots of ""creative"" ideas on how to handle conflict and communication in direct, healthy, and non violent ways."
3,passable...,This book was recommended by a priest.... but I found it elementary and condescending. Perhaps I've read too many of self-help books. Okay if you need a basic start.
3,UNinspiring,"I don't understand the rave reviews of the Linn brothers work. I found this book to be dreadfully simplistic, almost ""corny"". I needed something much deeper. If you're looking for a quick read on healing, then this is your book."
4,Basic But Good Coverage,The book may be a bit basic for anyone with a business background. But it is a good overview for a lot of topics and business basics that most law students will cover at some point or another during law school.
3,"The opposite of ""The view on humannature as fundamentally..""","When I listened to it the first time I was shocked, it was totally different from ""the view on humannature as fundamentally good"", no supercharged elektro pop, but slow feather-light tunes. If you expect the same fun tracks (I did!) like those on ""the view on humannature as fundamentally good"", you'll be greatly disappointed. This cd is more suited as background music. Most of the tracks are quite good, if you want to listen to relaxing music."
3,Smells like Wintergreen,"We used these about a month ago to make vanilla. Their function is fine. The lids seem a little flimsy, but I haven't had any break on me yet. My eyebrow raiser is that every one of the 12 units I've used smelled strongly of something Wintergreenish. I washed and rinsed them with hot water and dish soap. The smell seemed to mostly dissipate, but when I checked one yesterday I noticed some of the aroma was present along with the vanilla smell. Not sure what would cause that, or whether it will be a problem with the taste of the vanilla. We'll see in another month."
2,Thought it was a perfect bottle...but the medicinal odor is strong!,"Original thoughts: I bought these so I could make homemade vanilla (3 split vanilla beans and fill the rest with vodka, shake up once a month, ready to use in 2 mos. time). They are perfect gift sized bottles. The liquid doesn't drip from them. They were reasonably priced. Exactly what I was looking for!After reading another review and smelling my leftover bottles: Crud. I just made a bunch of vanilla for gifts using these. I didn't even notice the smell. I have two bottles left over (right next to me...) and I just smelled them. They both smell of something mediciney. I don't know what tea tree oil smells like, but the odor is strong. I also washed mine in hot, sudsy water before using them. So bummed."
2,"Some interesting facts, but....","This was written to provide a different perspective of the Archbishop. While it covered a little new ground for those who are familiar with the Archbishop's life, the main point the author made was that Sheen had faults.Indeed, it seemed the author was proud of the fact that he exposed Sheen as a sinner, just a man. Well, even those of us who love the Archbishop already know he wasn't perfect. The author came across as a little man trying to pull down a great man.Overall, the book was a disappointment."
5,Love it!,really tells you about relationships more than sex-things many people do not think about when they start or are in a relationship-which really brings you closer-great book.
2,A lot of work,"While the techniques in this book may work, they are a LOT of work. My wife and I never made it to the point where it worked."
5,Fit like a glove,This worked like a charm and bolted in beautifully. Be careful with the lubrication that is pre-sealed on under the plastic cap otherwise it will get everywhere.
3,Worked for awhile. Might be my fault.,"I installed this new a few months ago. However due to a new exhaust the wire was to short to fit. So I cut and spliced the wire, soldered it and sealed it back up to extend it. After about 6 months or so it started throwing codes, and eventually was causing my Jeep to barely run. To the point of full throttle would barely keep it alive.I replaced it (Came out nice and easy due to the anti-seize they put on the thread) with the exact same one, but managed to reroute the wire so I didn't have to splice it. So far (about 2 months) its worked without fail. So I can't say whether the first one was my doing, or if it was faulty anyways. But so far the new one is working well."
3,Average.,"It's a small book, and so it's relatively simple. It's basically a collection of information about various and sundry animals ranging from mythology to folklore to word-of-mouth. Understandably since it's a collection of essays by different people rather than a singly-authored book it isn't so in-depth, but it's not worth the $12 new price. Pick it up used--there's an occasional gem amid the stuff that can be found just about anywhere else."
2,spotty accuracy,"A quick look through this book turned up some pretty questionable material among the ""facts."" The most glaring is in the description of the Mass in page 6: ""Christians believe that the wine represents Jesus' blood and the bread represents his body."" While that's a perfectly accurate description of what many Christians believe today, it's not true of Catholics (the focus of the book) who beleive the bread and wine are far more than just a representation. The author falls into gender stereotypes on the same page, implying that rosaries were used solely by nuns. And while I can't absolutely prove it, it seems unlikely that monks' robes were ""dyed black, brown, gray, or white."" How would you dye something white? Isn't it far more likely that they used undyed wool in its natural colors? Much of the other information seems to be good, but without any sources given it's difficult to check."
4,Good lotion,I bought this when I was tanning pretty frequently and it did a great job at getting the results that you wanted with some patience
3,I Expected More,"I latched onto Mr. Koppel's book after catching him on NBC's ""Today"" program in an interview by Katie Couric. It seemed worthwhile to hear a noteworthy journalist's perspective on the world's goings-on. What I discovered was little more than Mr. Koppel's personal journal for 1999, though obviously written for publication.It did indeed intrigue me to find a network newsperson with such utter disdain and dislike for the selfishness and self-serving behavior of Bill Clinton. On occasion, Mr. Koppel's reflections spawned some of my own.Unlike other reviewers whose viewpoints Amazon has posted, I was less disenchanted with the book's content than its format. I wish Mr. Koppel would have established a point in time for the publication and moved topic-to-topic, rather than day-to-day."
5,Amazingly current 10 years later,"Picked this up while browsing in a bookstore; took it home and didn't put it down until I finished the book. It was surprising to remember what was in the news that almost-final year of the millennium, and perhaps not so surprising to find how well Mr. Koppel understood what would be meaningful and what would be long forgotten years later. His thoughts and commentary are still current, 10 years on. In addition to being a very entertaining read, the wisdom gleaned from a lifetime of news-reporting gives his comments an added sense of history. What fun to share his private, uncensored comments written in real time."
2,In Love With Thyself,Mr. Koppell is great on Nightline . . . unforntunately that does not translate to a great book. He concentrates on personal ruminations ranging from walking the dog to taking his father in law to the doctor with an occasional tidbit about Monica thrown in. Not worth the time to read or the $$ to buy.
1,"See me, hear me, me me me...Egotistical romp thru the mind.","I read this book a few months ago . . . actually I quit about halfway through. There were sufficient bad reviews that I was comfortable not warning others to avoid it. But it continues to draw some flies. Please, between Ted sharing his love of the high life and big bucks that being a sassy talking head has given him on his Florida Island retreat with his expensive yacht, you are given snippets of the great man's thought processes.At least he admitted he was wrong about many, many of his predictions, not that we wouldn't have known it anyway.But this 'world according to Ted' isn't just egotistical and greasy, it is written like he wants to be remembered.Just awful."
1,"Is this the best you can do, Ted?","...The dust cover should be a clue that this book is trivial. Here is Koppel, wearing a leather jacket and holding a stick. If that photo interests you, you will love this book. It is filled with self-indulgent information about Koppel and his grandchildren. It would have been a better book, perhaps, had Koppel chosen to write about the leather jacket and the stick.Readers who are able to overlook Koppel's arrogance will find little insight into international events. First, these events are quite dated. Kosovo, Monica and Viagra are not fresh, riveting subjects. Secondly, Koppel doesn't have the time to give us thoughtful insight. He appears to be jotting down a few bedtime thoughts about his day. And so often his predictions and views of current events prove wrong.What I came away with is the realization that much of our daily news stories are fleeting, insignificant events. ..."
4,Keeps them laughing.,My daughter first played this game with her cousins one night when visiting with them and the power went out. They sat by candlelight laughing and playing and having such a good time I came home and ordered it for us to have at home.
2,Don't Visit City of God,"Finally, I am finished this most obscure, tiresome and esoteric novel. I tried, I really did. After each sitting however, it became harder and harder to keep going. City of God is not the kind of book you pick up and read once a week or so - it commands your attention on a daily basis. Otherwise, taking on the novel infrequently (as I did I'm afraid) will result in a feeling somewhat like entering a busy, foreign marketplace without a clue as to where you are or where to go. Good luck."
3,"I love E. L. Doctorow, but...","Really challenging. There are so many voices in this book, I still don't know how many characters there are. Two married rabbis, a Christian priest, somebody's father, a bird-watcher, a writer, a Nazi-hunter... And most of them speak separately. Don't get me wrong, there are some golden nuggets of wisdom and insight into the Western world's views of the beginning of the universe, and God, or whatever you want to call that force, or non-force. This is one heck of a book and its very timely right now when so many people are questioning faith. This book makes you think, and I like that. But what's with the birds?..."
2,Time Better Spent,"I'm a little over halfway through and am thinking of giving up. Yes, I love the war stories and the philosophical wanderings in poetic format some of the time. Does one need a study guide to figure out who is who, though? I don't always know who's talking or what is happening. I'd rather move on to something else, maybe by a writer more sympathetic with his readers and their time spent. I did enjoy Waterworks."
2,Who has time for this?,"This is a book for someone with a long life ahead. As I grow older - and I just had a birthday yesterday - I have less time for puzzles like City of God. No doubt Doctorow is brilliant, but I no longer have time to spend on diversions that turn out to be mostly demonstrations of how clever the author can be in juggling multiple plot ideas and literary gimmicks. Fiction writers should remember that their work doesn't mean a thing if the reader doesn't read it. If they've a good point to make, they better make it easily accessible, because the novel has a lot of competition from other media these days."
5,Stick with it; it's worth it in the end,"It may be a tough read for some but it's well worth it. Stick with it. Yes, it has some misfires, but this is a beautiful, searing, searching, scientific AND spiritual book. Almost an act of faith in a desperate world. I would have probably given it 4 and 1/2 stars because it ain't a PERFECT book, but I also would have given it 10 stars because it borders on a profound declaration of hope and reason in a mad world. My girlfriend recommended this book to me and I am very, very thankful that she did."
3,Hmmmm!,"At the risk of sounding stupid, I must admit that I didn't understand the point of the book at all. While Doctorow's writing can be stunningly beautiful and, in places, unforgettable, unfortunately I found the organization of the book puzzling and the plot obscure. I was very disappointed."
2,Philosophically lacking,"This book is not a great theological manifesto. The theology of this book is the same addled-brained, pseudo-Christian sophistry that liberal denominations like the Unitarians, Congregationalists and Episcopalians have been shoveling at us for 75 years. Great literature challenges the major spiritual and moral assumptions of the day. This book simply adopts them."
1,What a waste of paper and time!,"After reading this book, I wish someone would explain why it got the rave reviews. The only interesting parts were the memoirs of the child in the Holocaust. It was totally confusing otherwise, with no explanation as to who the continually changing first person was in each section. As to the mystery of the cross that was moved, it was never explained. What a waste of paper and time!"
2,more convoluted than the brain,"This book, which I anticipated so much, having read a lot of other Doctorow, disappointed. Much of it felt to me like an introduction and I kept waiting for it to take off. I confess to not finishing it, so maybe it does do that later in the book, but it seemed to be starting and starting and starting...I wanted to be interested but couldn't find the story, at least not before I gave up. Give me the Book of Daniel or Ragtime or Billy Bathgate any time...City of God was under-edited and excessively self-conscious, like Doctorow was saying, ""aren't I clever?"" No, not this time."
3,Sublime but frustrating & too deliberately innovative,"This book is at turns beautifully written and frustratingly opaque. After a string of very tight novels, Doctorow dispensed with literary convention and wrote something innovative and daring... and more than somewhat over the top. Though there are moments of sublime writing, the multiplicity of perspectives -- which the reader is forced to puzzle out -- is tedious. In its intentional striving towards novelty (no pun intended), the book reminds me of Calvino's If on a Winter's Night a Traveler, except that Calvino doesn't take himself so terribly seriously; that Doctorow does is perhaps not surprising, though, given his topic (our conceptions of God). Ultimately I prefer Doctorow in a more sustained, disciplined style, as in The World Fair -- which achieves so very much exactly because its pretenses are so much more limited."
2,City of Confusion,"Perhaps I was reading about the election in Flordia, as I am just as confused with both the City of God and the State of Florida. On reading the reviews of Doctrow's book I continued to feel somewhat stupid, as I have little understanding of what the author was trying to convey in this stream of consiousness. I sense the author was putting us to some kind of test and no one has indicated that the Emporer has no clothes. Harry Potter is looking better everyday and, in his favor, he is too young to vote!."
2,Confusing and hard to follow,I have read 1/2 of this book and find it a most difficult book to follow. There are rambeling sentences that seem to never end and by time you reach the end you need to reread it. It shifts back and forth from theme to theme challenging you to understand where it's trying to go.It brings up a philosopher that I have never heard of and doubt if most collage graduates other than philosophy majors have. I doubt if I can force myself to finish the book and maybe if I do my opinion may change BUT I don't think most people will get past the first few pages.
1,Couldn't finish it,"I forced myself to read the first 1/3 of this book, but I just couldn't finish it. I just couldn't follow it."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this book. While it had it's moments and there was some eloquent language, I did not appreciate the resolution."
1,god is in the details,"i was unable to finish the book because of the plethora of scientific mistaments in the first few pages: 1.the universe is not expanding at an exponential rate as stated on the first page. it may have expanded at this rate for a small fraction of a second of it's existence, but for the most part it expanded at a much lower rate. 2. the speed of light is not 183 million miles a second as stated somewhere in the first thirty pages of the book. 3. einstein would have been able to see himself in the mirror while traveling near the speed of light. that's the major point of the theory of relativity. 3. the force of gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two objects, not to the distance between two objects as stated somewhere near the start of the book."
1,City of God It Is Not,"I bought this book on the basis of the excerpt reviews on the book's cover. And the beginning of the book itself -- the Big Bang, etc. But I agree with the reviewers who have given it one star. In spite of my strong interest in philosophy, cosmology, fiction & literature & religion, the book did not sustain my interest. It does seem to be a notebook. I, too, have paid money for it; so, I will finish reading the last quarter of the book."
2,utterly unreadable,"To say I'm disappointed would be an understatement. This pretentious and overblown work aspires to be philosophical and grand-scale (a modern day Ulysses perhaps, but I shudder to compare this work to Ulysses which is one of my all time favorites) but is almost totally unreadable. Sure there are great snippets and some great writing, but unless you're planning on taking weeks out of your schedule, you simply will not be able to follow the threads. I'm happy to admit any shortcomings on my part as a reader for those inclined to criticize my lack of apprehension, but this work of genius really eluded me. I'll even say it went over my head. Having just finished Stendhal's The Red and the Black which was an enjoyable experience, I found reading this one a chore that I barely made it through.As I said, I did enjoy specific passages and some of the sub plots, but the pretentions to greatness and the obtuseness of the narrative wore me down. Good luck trying to get through it."
2,Not Much of a Read,"I have absolutely doted on Doctorow for years and was disappointed beyond measure with this latest self-indulgent effort. There is here, a sense of arrogant disregard for the reader - ""follow me if you can"" - that is far removed from the wonderful, and so readable stuff I was expecting. Rule 1 is, was, and always will be ""People shouldn't want to put it down"". Not this one I'm sorry to say. Yes I admit it, I couldn't be bothered to finish it."
1,Pretentious,"Although I have enjoyed some of Doctorow's previous works, such as ""Ragtime"" and ""Billy Bathgate"", I struggled to even finish this disappointing work. Doctorow changes points of view so often and unpredictably in the book that it was sometimes baffling to read. In the end I felt that the author was simply trying to show us how much smarter he is than the rest of us and was suffering from a serious case of pretentiousness."
1,"Say it ain't so, E.L.","How did the author of ""Ragtime"" and ""Book of Daniel"" come up with this mess? He must have been cleaning out his literary refrigerator: ""Let's see--here's a plot line that never went anywhere; here are some musings on Big Things that don't fit anywhere else; maybe I can finally get rid of these experimental ideas I never got around to using 25 years ago . . ."" I hope this book was an aberration. I'd hate to see Doctorow go the way of Updike, continuing to write when he no longer has much of interest to say."
4,Metaphysics for Postmoderns,"This is a brilliant book, only partly a novel, important to read and often thrilling, but not consistently compelling. Several motifs appear. Most resolve into the body of the piece, but a few remain frustratingly obscure. Doctorow's theme is our craving for transcendental and romantic meaning despite the failure of religion. While many postmoderns give a pass to ""organized"" religions in favor of a vague spirituality, Doctorow knows that if the metaphysical holds any meaning for mankind it must be vetted--tracked and challenged in all its sobersided and pop manifestations--by a community of seekers. City of God invites us in. It is Doctorow's gift that he can connect difficult theological and cosmological ideas and render them simply and vividly for his readers. We get a close-up view of the bleeding edge of contemporary philosophy. While we cannot expect closure to his tale, we can appreciate his wise guidance."
4,Not your normal novel,"I love this book. I enjoyed the abstract writings and non-linear style of it. Anyone who gives this book a bad review just wasn't up to the challenge of reading it. As a previous reviewer said, it takes a lot of thought to read and understand, but the book provokes such thought, and puts God in such a brilliant perspective, that it is well worth it.The only parts that I wasn't able to read into and enjoy were the ""standards."" Did anyone else read and understand the meaning behind them? Please Email me."
5,Read this book,"Do not pay attnetion to the nay-sayers who describe this book as too difficult. This book will flow for you, if you experience it with an open mind. This is a deeply rewarding book by a mature writer. In the future, people will wonder that this book was not better received than it has been; in the future, people will still read this book. It is a novel about the wonder of it all, a leap from Mr. Doctorow's previous works."
4,A book to make you think,"If you like Doctorow you'll enjoy this book, although it a bit different from his earlier writing...perhaps more overtly cerebral at least in the contemporary part (there is a subplot that takes place during World War II). Full of likeable but imperfect characters."
1,Disappointing,"Doctorow is one of my favorite authors, thus my disappointment with this book was keener than it would have been had not the writer been of such great stature. I did not finish this book. I was completely bored by all the philosophyzing and was confused by the random organization. I REALLY hated the pages dedicated to the lyrics of popular songs. What was the point? I certainly hope that Doctorow's next effort will measure up to his past works."
1,Guess it depends who you are...,"I can't help but think that if this hadn't been written by an established author, it never would have seen the light of day. (For example, if I had submitted it to a publisher, I feel sure it would have been rejected as rambling, disjointed, not making sense, what's really happening & what's taking place in the writer's head, etc.) It was still interesting & thought-provoking for all that, though."
2,DO WE HAVE ENOUGH WOOD TO SPEND FOR PAPERS?,"Doctorow is one of my favorite authors. But this time I'm really sad! Literature, philosophy, religions is my area. And I'm not a reader-of-easy-readings. And I know that there are many books hard to read but you can read. City of God, a book, may be Mr Doctorow began to write down this ""novel"" with a big idea, he wanted to put some new-or-old ""things""in it. But there must be very simple ""thing""in every book. Write a book to read! And if you want to wite a book for just a few friends, a few professor who don't like to read a novel, and a few experts who write ""good..perfect...revolution in literature!..."" before read the book, you have no need to publish it. You can use a fotocopy machine, putthem in files and send by mail. To many papers means to many wood even if you use re-cyclings. (Sorry Mr Doctorow. My first star just for you and second star just for the name of book)"
3,An inspiring hero,"What most impressed me about George Wahlen is that it was only many years after the war ended that his wife finally found out about his Medal of Honor. That reminds me of my own parents. I cannot ever remember them bragging about themselves.George Wahlen is not only a true hero, but a humble one at that. Thus, the title of the book."
3,The Quite Hero,"primarily short diary enteries from the men and women who experienced the different battles. I had hoped there would be more of a story line, but still interesting to read about."
3,Bad pocket clip,"I had the same experience as another reviewer. I received the knife and was very impressed. It was one of my favorite knives. Unfortunately, the pocket clip on the knife is not very long nor does it hold the knife in place very well. As a result of that, the knife fell out of my pocket about 2 weeks after I received it. Because of my work, I always have a knife in my pocket. I have never lost a knife that I was carrying until this one. It was very disappointing."
5,COLLECTOR'S REVIEW,"I AM A COLLECTOR HAVING A GOOD COLLECTION OF ALL SHORTS OF KNIVES (HUNTING-FOLDING ECT).FIRST TIME I SHAW GERBER APPLEGATE ON THE WEB I WAS AMASED, WHILE WHEN I HAD I WAS THRILLED!! ITS QAULITY IS SUPERB WHILE ITS MULTIUSAGE MAKE IT A USEFUL TOOL TO CARRY EVERYWERE! ...AFTER THAT I WILL PAUSE COLLECTION FOR SOME TIME!!!"
4,Great folding knife!,"I have owned this knife for about 5 years. It is a great medium folder that locks securely when extended. It kept it's original edge for several years before I needed to sharpen it. I use the clip on it to keep it in my pocket for every day carry. The back of the blade is wide at the base with good chimping for thumb control when needed. The thumb opening action works very well too. I recently lost one of the two screws that keeps the clip on, and am trying to find a replacement because it is now loose. I know once I correct the loose clip it will provide many more years of reliable use."
4,Good smaller version of the 45780,This knife is of good quality and is a smaller version of the full size. It is easier to carry but is not a general purpose knife.
3,Great Knife with a bad pocket clip,Good sharp knife but ..... Had this knife for 2 months and lost it due to the poor quality of the pocket clip. It is not springy enough to take the daily abuse. It took about 2 weeks for it to lose enough spring so that it would fall out of my jeans pocket. Now it is gone and I will not be buying a Gerber to replace it!10/15/2010 Have a Spyderco for the last 6 months and the pocket clip is still as good as new!
4,Southern Christian Rock,"This disc was pulled from many Christian retailers be cause of a short cover of ac/dc's Back In Black by a band called Metropolitan. The nice gem on this compilation disc is of early Third Day. They do a medley of Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus-Can't Help Falling In Love-With Or With Out You. Not bad for so early in their career. There are many different styles of music on this disc all recorded live at the old Strand Theatre in downtown Marietta, GA. Another good song on here Flavor Of The Month by a band called My Friend Stephanie (they had 4 national releases since then). It's good Southern Rock and a nice little piece of history."
3,English post-colonialism,"As a student of English literature I found this book hard to follow at first. Yet reading beyond a certain point, I understood the specialness of the diverse characters and the interelations between the characters. It is a beautiful book if you are willing to take the time to read deep into the novel. I'm glad I got the chance to read this novel."
5,Honors the dead,"This 119-page book honors the memory of 149 men and women and 19 children murdered in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995 when the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was attacked.Since the book's July 1995 publication, questions have been raised as to possible connections between this devastating 1995 attack and the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Concerning those, one can consult The Final Report on the Bombing of The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building April 19, 1995--conducted by the private Oklahoma Bombing Investigation Committee organized by Oklahoma State Representative Charles Key and Jayna Davis' more recent book, The Third Terrorist.The Grand Jury which indicted Timothy McVeigh, along with ""others unknown,"" including at least one subpoenaed Jordanian suspect, who had fled. The ""others"" were never found.This book is a fine memorial for the victims, and its proceeds from its sale were donated to the family of victims."
3,"Well, my opinion is a bit different from yours","I didn't think this was a great book, a page-turner. In my opinion it is only a reasonable book, at best. The theme - humankind fighting against the monstrous Dark Ones in an alternate universe - is fascinating, but I think Barbara Hambly lacks the necessary story-telling skills to make this fascinating theme come to life. An example: I think Ms Hambly could play with the contrasts among our world and the fantasy world of the Dark Ones. The characters that were translated by the wizard Ingold to that universe adapt so well to a medieval society that it seems like they were born there. Well, that's my opinion. If you're desperate for a good book you should spend it buying another one, but if you just want to spend some time reading, go for it sefirot@bol.com.br"
3,Very early work,"I bought this book because I have enjoyed others by Barbara Hambly, but I have have to say that it reads like an early book. A little slow to get started, a great deal of discussion about feelings and foreboding without her usual wit and style. It wasn't bad, per se, but it just didn't grip me. I found the characters hard to empathize with and sudden personality changes unrealistic. I stayed with it through the first book, and I have a feeling the following books in the series may be better, but I feel no drive to find out what happens."
3,An o.k. $3.00 read,An O.K. $3.oo read. I found it entertaining and amusing. The characters were those you might find in a fairey tale for adults of a lesser depth like myself. I can pass the time by almost anything of a shallow nature.
4,The Time of the Dark by Barbara Hambly,The Time of the Dark by Barbara Hambly was a great book. The first in her Darwath trilogy. Definitely worth hunting down if you can find it.
2,"Gave it a shot, didn't care for it","I read the first 50 pages or so. Supreme evil, wizard, 'the one who will save us all' blah blah. It felt like a poor shadow of the Fionavar Tapestry. Lost interest."
4,What if your worst nightmare came true?,"This book, first of four, concerns a young graduate student, Gil, who finds that her nightmares of people fleeing in panic from an almost-unseen, hideous evil, are not fantastic dreams: she is standing in the doorway to another world. Gil and Rudy, a biker-gang hanger-on who's in the wrong place at the wrong time, are reluctantly drawn into this other world where they must fight for their lives. Their new friends, including the warrior known as the Icefalcon, the wizard Ingold Inglorion, the newly-widowed Queen Minalde, and her infant son Altir, depend on the newcomers for the valuable information *they don't even know they possess.* Great characters, plus the author writes convincing dialog well"
3,Fantasy,"I really thought I could read fantasy, but I just can't. This book is The Never-Ending Story meets The Lord of the Rings (literally, remember the nothing?). I don't think it's poorly written- there are pages & pages of description and background, but I just couldn't not latch on. Even the far fetched things don't bother me, it's just page after page of words with no dialogue and a seemingly undefeatable enemy. I didn't even finish it."
2,Space Amoeba,"This film did have some interesting moments, but overall it is not one that I would recommend even for hard core science fiction fans and those who enjoy the films made by the Japanese studios. I was disappointed. I kept waiting for something significant to happen and it never did."
5,Space Amoeba- A Great Monster Movie,"Space Amoeba is a great sci-fi monster movie. It is better than most people think it is. The monsters are different than those you would normally see, but thats a good thing.The acting is good, the monsters are well designed (especially Kameba, the turtle). The movie has a lot of action for a kaiju film and it keeps the viewer interested.This movie is worth the price! Buy this movie and enjoy it again and again! A great monster movie for a great price."
2,DVD Technical problems,"I am hoping this is an isolated incidet, however, two-thirds way through ""Space Amoeba"" the chapters go awry and jump back to the beginning. Upon manual chapter advance, the last chapters do not appear to be present. We have played it in several machines with the same dissapointing results. Time to buy another copy of the same, and keep our fingers crossed (this is in regard to the authorized Tokyo Shock version). Otherwise the film quality is wonderful. We'd just like to see the whole film..."
1,Doesn't work,I have this printer for 15 years and never had problem with the cartridge before.I could not find it in the store so I bought on amazon.com from this seller.This cartridge suppose to be new. First few pages was very pale after that was nothing. Useless.WASTE OF MONEY.
1,This was a remanufactured product,"The company that rebuilt that cartridge did an awful job. The print quality is poor, and forget trying to print any pictures because the ink is too weak to be seen in anything lighter then black, yup shades of gray are either entirely missing or so weak they can't really be seen well. I ended up buying a new (not remanufactured) cartridge instead and now the printing of shades of gray is great. Also the cartridge page printing capabilities was far less then a new one. I thought I could find a decent rebuilt cartridge to save money, but instead got horrible results and ended up buying a new one anyways. Save your money, at least don't buy it from this cartridge rebuilder, find another with known high reviews."
3,silky dress purchase,"i misjudged size of dress had to return for another size, hopefully it comes soon. It's to be my wedding dress!"
2,watch Three Seasons instead,"A few years back, we had the movie, Three Seasons, from Vietnam. This effort is similar in scope, but not of the same quality and camera work can be of the amateur level."
2,If you can get past the shoddy camera work....,"you might have been able to watch the entire movie without getting motion sickness. This paparazzi type of film shooting works well occasionally, and gives it a documentary type of feeling. However, when it is as often as it is in this movie you become very aware of the camera and its movements, which detracts from the story and the movie itself. All you become aware of is the CAMERA and the cameraman, and why the hell isn't he using a tripod or something?!?!? Don't most people want to get into a movie and empathize with the characters? I couldn't see how this was possible when we are constantly reminded that they are only actors being filmed by a shakey cameraman.The story was fine. A feel good film, sappy and happy."
1,so boring,"My god, this is a boring, unrealistic movie. The uncle of the main character yell at her, so she ran away to Saigon. Are you kidding me ? She would have last 10 min in Saigon. Hell she would have last 5 min in NYC. The dialogue is stiff,the story is unrealistic, the actors are not very good. Three Seasons are so much better."
3,Disappointed!,I came across Vernor Vinge's name in another book and read some Amazon reviews of this book which were very positive. Lots of new twists but basically just another bunch of wars this time with time bubbles.
3,Good hard SF novel,"The best reason I would say this is a worth read, is that it is a requisite for reading the sequel, which is a lot better. Generaly, the technological ideas here are far superior to the plot-line build and character development, even though the plot does keep you on your toes. it is an interesting and fun read, recommended."
5,Best scifi i have read in years,"I bought this book along with the seguel and i read both in a matter of three days it was just totally mind blowing the whole concept of going forward in time simply by ""bobbling"" yourself off, of exploring space in what would same to you a matter of minutes or weeks but in actuality a millenia ,of awakening in a distant future and the human race had vanished, like i said mind blowing an excellent read two thumbs way up!"
1,SO Hard To Read,"Such a lack of character development, amazingly dry and fragmented writing. I end up getting the gist after a paragraph and having to go back and reread. The author has no concept of fleshing out the 1 dimensional characters. Wili goes from dangerous thief to wunderkind under Paul's tutelage after just a few days and never looks back. Sure, people act like that in half hour sitcoms, but not in real life and it's just not a believable premise for the rest of the plot. I'm ok with boring cardboard characters if the plot is good. Alas, it's not. Bobbles. Ok. I think the author wrote himself into a corner and had to resort to magic to solve the problems in the end. In this case, the magic is the unlimited super-intelligence of the computer that interfaces directly with Wili (with no computer uprising either) and they save the day by being so amazingly super-intelligent. Sigh. There are so many superior dystopia books out there, I have NO IDEA how this one won any awards."
4,Awesome Captivating Story,"I picked this up after reading that it was the first installment of a ""trilogy"" which ends with ""Marooned in Realtime"". Having read Marooned in Realtime, I found this 1st installment filled in many of the gaps (of course, right). Nonetheless, the pace of the story was excellment, reading like a suspense book most of the time versus a sci-fi book. A great read, it is well wrote your time and money."
3,An earlier (and not as good) book from the Author,"I bought this book primarily because I LOVED ""A Fire Upon the Deep"" and ""A Deepness in the Sky."" Be forewarned - this is nothing like those books. Those books had some real mind-binding concepts and an intricate plot with well developed characters. This is a straightforward Grade B Sci-Fi novel. It's set in a future where the common folk are rebelling against the oppressive overlords. Honestly, I had to fight to make it through this book - it was just kind of slow, boring and the characters were no one I really cared about. If you're looking for something else from Vinge, look elsewhere."
4,Good Yarn,"This book was an enjoyable read, if a little light. It is a quick read (I finished it in a couple days). The plot was fast paced and the characters were memorable. However, this probably wasn't Vinge's greatest book. If you like Vinge you will most likely enjoy this book. However, if you haven't read any of his stuff yet go pick up ""A Deepness in the Sky."" It is pretty fantastic if a little long."
1,Kindle version very poor quality...,"$9.99 for a Kindle version??? Same price as a NY Times Bestseller???WHAT A RIP OFF!This looks like it was cut and pasted into digital format - very UNprofessional - am surprised Amazon has the nerve to charge this much for it...horrible quality.Did I miss somewhere that this amateurish ""story"" is geared towards youngsters??? Surely not the ""hard sci-fi"" it is made out to be in the opening review. Couldn't even finish this story - deleted from Kindle - don't waste your money!"
4,"A really good read, by a good author.","Read this book years ago, and have been looking for my own copy ever since. Please bring it back into print! Possibly better than the ""Fire Upon the Deep"", but either way a rare and good book.Well worth tracking down.... now where is my credit card!"
1,Couldn't finish this one.,"I forced my way through all but the last 50ish pages. I gave up in a fit of cross-country road-tripping boredom was better alleviated by counting cow catchers in the Texas heat. I wish I was lying.Dull characters, no one to even remotely get interested in or even attached too! A world of low tech and warlord mentality should have been interesting. Wrong. Disarming has never been so flaccid."
4,Everything But The Girl - Missing (The Full Remix),"The track that blew up Everything But the Girl: MISSING. And it's a beautiful track that had the misfortune to be completely played out. But it's still a turning point both in EBTG's career and on the club scene. Todd Terry's Mix is the one that drew all the attention, and Chris and James deliver an fine, if unremarkable, club mix that pushes a little more energy, but on this remix EP, there are a few surprises too. Ultramarine craft a mellow mix around some warm electronics and that unmistakable acoustic guitar line--a much different feel from what we're used to--and Little Joey emphasizes the inherent sadness in the track, reversing the vocal track until it almost sounds like a dirge. So even if you never want to hear the track again, these other mixes might just change your mind."
4,There's a 7th track,"It's a great song worthy of remixes. Besides the 6 listed tracks, my copy has a 7th track which seems to be the backing drum track without vocals (duration 2:47). This could probably be useful for a DJ mixing or just finding some background beats while you talk in between songs."
1,writers cramp,"this could probably have been an interesting story, but Ms. Rice apparently has forgotten how to write. Short, jerky sentences with little substance. She must have gotten writers block after the third vampire book."
3,"just okay, especially for Rice, spoilers",the wrong man was killed early on leaving us with a truly lousy villain to deal with for most of the novel. The heroine is apparently in her mid twenties and has never had sex and holds out against the eon old pharoah love god for way too long. her inner dialogues on should she or shouldn't she are very annoying. the introduction of cleopatra was completely unnecessary and throws any sense of morality out the window as the confused damaged creature goes on a murder spree including the villain in a most unsatisfying fashion. the miracle potion is far too powerful to contemplate in any meaningful way. on the bright side the female lust is entertaining and Anne's picture on the back cover is pretty sexy
3,Anne please take it easy.,"Even though I love Anne Rice's mysterious novels I found this novel dull. It lacked the mystery and the pizzazz of the Vampire series. The characters where a little distant and I felt a little disappointed. Ramses was interesting but lacking, and outside of the usual interesting philosophical arguments I could not befriend him."
2,Rice has written some beauties - but this isn't one of them.,"As a lover of all things Egyptian as well as all things Anne Rice, it was with much anticipation that I picked up this book. I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed with this novel. Ramses is an immortal man who is cursed with insatiable hungers for food, women, and drink. He entombed himself during Cleopatras time, and does not awaken again until the year 1914 when an English Egyptologist uncovers his resting place and brings him to London. Coming to his senses in England, Ramses immediately begins to cause trouble and consume everything in his path. Handsome and charming, he is refused nothing. Even so, he longs for his ancient Egypt and makes a horrible mistake in his efforts to curb his desire. He endangers the woman he has come to love, as well as all of London! Not a bad story altogether, but it's not one of my favorites, either."
4,Where's the next one!?,"I absolutly loved this book. The only reason I gave it a four, instead of a five was because I found it quite... confusing at times. It is wonderfully written and would be great for those who love Anne Rice's tales of her vampires.But, what I want to know is where is the next one? I believe there should be another book to finish this one, and its greatness up!"
3,I've read better.,"Rice weaves her usual tale of sensual horror in The Mummy, but sadly, it fails to attract in the same fashion as her previous novels. It is a good read as an introduction to Rice, but fans will be slightly dissapointed by its lack of ability to keep the reader from putting it down."
4,Exceptional,"I've always taken interest in Egyptology, and Anne Rice is my favorite writer, so I had to try this one. There is not much about the actual Egyptian culture in this novel, but it's a great ""What would happen if...?"" story. Fun, and it needs a sequel. Amazing, just the thought of passing Ramses the Great on the street."
2,The most boring book I've read,"I read the book because of the many recommendations that were made of it. But I can't understand how could anyone like it. It seems that Rice has found a writing formula, and uses it over and over again, plus the novel perhaps can give chills to preteenage girls from the ninth century, but all attempts to schock the reader stays just as attempts. It's amazing just how predictable the novel is, and of course, from the first chapter you can realize there will be a sequel. Please don't!"
5,The Mummy,"I have sat many an evening pouring over Anne Rice books and have never had a dull moment. This book, however, is one of my all time favorites. The charactors were a work of art. From the smells of the embalming rooms to the blue of Rameses eyes... I felt as if I were there myself. The Witches of Mayfair, Lasher..Taltos, Pandoro,all are marvelous. But being a true Eqyptian Mummy fan from Karloff until the Brandon Frasier version, this is the best by far."
3,Not Bad,"I rather enjoyed this book. Firstly because it is about Egypt. I also found the idea of a 'serum for death' rather intriguing. It also didn't hurt that Ramses was a hunk. Cleopatra, even though she was evil, was a rather interesting character as well - unfortunately the English girl was a saccharine little bore and I was mystified as to what Ramses the Babe saw in her. The book was enjoyable though with an interesting storyline."
3,Good...,"When I started reading it, I love Julie Stratford. She was a modern woman (back then) but when she fell in love with Ramses, she turned all soft. Overall, this book is nice but gets boring to the end."
2,rather very mediocre,"Having enjoyed her neurotic and interesting immortals in the Vampire chronicles and her bits about Egypt, I was (mistakenly) enthusiastic to read this one. Well, it is a simple potboiler, with two-dimensional characters and a rather flimsy plot. Even the evocations of history are flaccid and lack subtlety. I suspect that she is writing this junk as fast as she can and thinking that this is her moment to make some money so she will make as much as she can while she can.If you are seeking high-quality gothic horror, pass this one up. Howoever, it you don't particularly care and want a story that moves along, this is OK. It is strictly throw away.Not recommended."
2,disappointment,Having read The Vampire Lestat I was keen to learn more about the enigmatic immortals Rice mentions in that excelent book. But Ramses the Damned turned out to be a total disappointment. You have to wait for 200 pages for some action and even then it is predictable. Most of the time the book reminded me of some B-movie script. And there is no trace of the mysteries from Vampire Chronicles. It is supplanted by a sluggish blandness. I barely brought myself to finish it.
4,One of the best books I've ever read!!,"I've read the book three times and it's still as great as the first read... It's thrilling and suspenseful... It just fantastic! Anne Rice is one of the most experienced writers ever!Also, you should read (if you haven't already) ""Interview with the Vampire"" and ""The Queen of the Damned""..."
3,"OK, but formulaic","It read like an old movie, which I suppose it was meant to. None of the steaminess of the vampire books, this was almost chaste, but beyond that predictable and a little boring. A fast read."
2,Huge disappointment,"I'd foundServant of the Bones (Mass Market Paperback)in my university library and had enjoyed it greatly, so I thought I'd let Anne Rice entertain me again with a book about one of my greatest interests, Egypt. She didn't.Because of the settings and locations--early 1900s London and Egypt--and the characters--a murdered British archeologist and the main character, his Edwardian daughter--I kept thinking (or hoping) I was reading an Elizabeth Peters novel. But I every time I thought it, I was reminded that it sadly wasn't by the utter badness that was everywhere in this book. There was the badness of the writing, the characterization, the story, and probably other things that I can't even remember anymore. It was basically a romance novel."
5,The Best Rice Novel,"I love to read Anne Rice, and this was my favorite of all of her books. What makes it so great is she takes actual people from history and adds a little fiction to their lives, and that is what made this story so intriguing for me. Ramses the Great was once the ruler of Egypt, and he wanted to live forever, so he drank the elixir of life. He later finds that immortality is more of a curse than a gift. He awakens after 2000 years of sleep to 1940 London, and he has new adventures in a new time that he does not understand. I highly recommend this book if you like Anne Rice."
3,"3 1/2 Stars***Good, but could have been MUCH better","An easy, fun read--but it didn't grab me like I was hoping it would. For one thing, Julie-the heroine-is incredibly dull and Alex? Zzzzzzzzzzzz...The side/supportive characters are where it's at. Elliott--so sneaky, Henry--blech, Ramses--*swoon* and Cleopatra, well she is wild, unpredictable, emotional and fascinating.Personally, I think a better story would have been Ramses and Cleopatra during Cleopatra's time. Throw some Antony in there--and now THERE's a story.Despite the criticism, it's definitely worth reading if you like Anne Rice or Ancient Egypt."
5,Beautifully dark and seductive,"I love this novel! it feels so different from any of Anne's other works, but it doesnt lose her signature descriptive writing style. Its sometimes dark and pretty sexy at times. The characters are all perfectly described. I loved Ramses in this. I could literally visualise every scene and location. This is one of my favorite Anne Rice novels. It really has it all. I could barely put it down and have re-read it 3 times now. The way she writes, it makes it almost believable."
3,"Very good book, dull at points, but interesting.......","This book, like the rest of Anne Rice's books was very good! As usual, she paints a magnificent picture of the past that Ramses and Cleopatra came from, and the present that they see for themselves. Beautiful imagery, and constant suspense. I think that, of course Ramses was my favorite character, but strangely enough, Elliot Savarell had my votes too. I like the description Anne Rice gave him; of how even in his old age, he was very handsome! Her picture of Alex Savarell had me dreaming too =) The ending was ESPECIALLY cliffhanging, with Cleopatra still being alive, and Elliot and Julie 'starting anew'. I some parts it DRAGGED ALONG, and was a little boring, but it was breif, and if was an overall excellent book. Read it!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Rice takes a break from the bloodsuckers and heads for bandages. Of course, being a romance type writer, not a lot of rotting smelly staggering corpse mummies to be found here, just a charismatic, charming, dangerous version, instead.Other than that, the usual setting, noble Egyptian awakened, hangs out with a woman who can't resist him, and has a horrible secret. These mummy guys crave sun, sex and all that sort of thing.A secret potion gives the mummy his immortality and superhuman powers, and he seeks out Cleopatra, intending to revive her, but ends up creating a monster instead."
3,"Good read but don't expect a ""Vampire"" book","This was an interesting period novel but don't expect the frights, depth, darkness or creepiness of the Vampire series. Adjust your expectations and I think you'll find a good vacation page turner."
5,Anne Rice at her Best,"I can't think of a more perfect book. the only flaw is that it might be nice to get a sequel, but I think it's too late now. The Mummy is a fantastic adventure story, with some romance thrown in for good measure. Ramses is found and he's not actually dead. He finds himself in early 1900's Cario, and what happens next is awesome. Even if you've never read any Anne Rice, you will not be lost, this is a stand alone novel. My husband read this book and also thought it was great, so don't be put off if you are male. Read it - you'll like it!"
4,The mummy or Ramses the Damned,"I really enjoyed this novel. It had suspense, mystery and action!I have never read a novel by Anne Rice before and I must say that I found this book hard to put down. I was hooked from the very first page.I want to go to Egypt now.:)"
5,Wonderful Read,"I like Anne Rices other reads, they just seem to be a little slow I find her describing everything from the color of the dress the character is wearing to the size of her shoes. That is just too much for me in The mummy the characters are well developed, smart and most importantly like real people. They have faults and by the end of the book you find yourself caring about them for a first time Anne Rice reader I would recommend this too start with."
2,Didn't buy it!,"Although I found parts of the book held my attention there were contradictions and inconsistences. A great part of it reads like a Harlequin Romance novel. I didn't buy for a second that a powerful, charismatic character as Ramses could possible be interested in a simpering, clinging, crying, snivelling Julie. Same holds true for Cleopatra's interest in Alex. Come on! Give us some strong characters for the hero and heroine!"
5,NEED THE SEQUEL!!!,I desperately need the sequel to this book. If anybody knows if it has been published yet and what is is called and where it is available could you PLEASE let me know. Anything will be useful.....
5,Captivating!,"I absolutly loved this book! This was my first book that I read by Anne Rice, and although I was a little hesitant at first, I was hooked from page one. The imagery is captivating! The story travels back and forth between the sweeping deserts of Egypt to high soceity England in the 18th century. I was also quite enamored by the immortal (and sexy) Ramses and the villianous Cleopatra. I can't wait until the sequel comes out! I hope that in the next installment, Ramses will exude even more sexiness, and perhaps, mold into the erotic character that he really is."
5,All You Need To Know About Cheesecakes!,"I own ten or twelve cheesecake cookbooks; but this one, the first one I ever purchased, is far and away my favorite. You will learn all you need to know about baking these wondrous desserts from reading this book. There is a section on equipment, a section on crusts, then the cheesecakes that are baked and those that are only chilled. There is also a section on cheesecakes from different lands.I have baked at least a half dozen of these recipes several times over the years and have baked one or two of them dozens of times. My favorite, which I have done a little adjusting to to make it my own, is the New Zealand cheesecake. You can take that basic recipe and do anything you want to to it.You may find a cheesecake cookbook with more and prettier photographs but you will not find one with better, basic foolproof recipes."
5,Joy of Cheesecake,I received this book as a gift almost 20 years ago. Now I purchased the book for my daughter. Although I still read and try other cheesecake recipes I find that I end up resorting to old faithful. This book will never let you down.
3,good ideas,"Not quite what I thought I was getting. Could use more pictures, it always helps to see what you are making. I was expecting more unique ideas for cheesecakes. It is more a collection of classic and basic recipes. It does have some good tips and ideas for different type of crusts."
3,Not my type of cookbook,I really didn't think this was a cookbook with cheesecakes I would make. I don't put a lot of the ingredients that is required in my cakes. Need to like to use a lot of different ingredients that I don't use. Just like more conserative ones. If you like desserts that use licores in it this would be your book.
3,A ok,"Good book, useful but not special. Decent read, several not cheesecake receipes. Did learn a great trick for cutting cheesecake."
1,Broken,"Got it fast but it came broken, good sound but if you want an ajustable cup mute don't get this one."
5,nostalgia,this book reminds me of when i was younger and EVERYONE checked this book out at the library. it even had the little boy's name in it. poor kid i would be angry if my parents pawned off my awesome i spy book!
4,Nice Book,These books are generally fun for kids of all ages. Some kids will like them more than others. I don't think I can really make a blanket review that all kids would enjoy these books.
5,Love It!,"This book is primarily for kids, but I have found it to be lots of fun, too! Will definitely order more!"
5,I Spy Fantasy,"Product delivery was speedy. Item in good condition, as promised. I would purchase from this seller in the future."
4,Great fun a time filler,We have 4 of the I Spy books and this is one of the best. The kids read them over and over again.
1,Stay Away from this piece of JUNK !!!,"I would rate a Zero, but that wasn't an option. This is such a poor quality clamp I threw mine away. First off as preasure is applied to the work piece the clamping preasure causes the handle to walk right off the shaft causing loss of any hold. I drilled a pin into the handle and through the very soft metal rod its pushed onto to prevent this. Then found as preasure was applied to the work piece the wedge clamp section completely distorted on its mount (Plastic), so no longer were the pieces held paralell. Go with the Besey, its 3 times more with good reason, it actually works. I always thought of Stanley as quality but they have obviously sold out on this cheap import. There is no way they could have tested it and thought yeah, this will work."
4,Beautifully illustrated; not enough information for me.,"At first glance this book is a ten but because of the limited information in it I have downgraded that to a seven.If you arenew to adventurous cuisine this book will guide you in areas previous unexplored. I personally found that, while I appreciated the beautiful color photos, I would have much preferred more food information. For example, one entry explains that something is made from almond paste but does not explain how to make almond paste. There is no separate entry under 'Almond Paste'. Some information; not enough; beautful photos. A good getting-started book."
2,dead fish,This was a disappointment for gary oldman. part was definely not for him. have seen robert carlyle in different characters and as usual very funny. but too silly for mr oldman/.
4,I Liked It,"I thought it was very funny, though it took about the third viewing for me to get most of the British dialog straight (blame my bad American ear). It was fun!"
1,avoid like the smell of dead fish,A pointless movie that never finds its true identity - it tries too hard and not enough at the same time. The movie has a good cast that got wasted for naught.
2,"Really, Really off-beat comedy","Sometimes I wonder what really makes the Brits laugh. I really can't explain what went on, other than Gary Oldman, the hit man falls in love with this pregnant girl at a train station......Karel Rodan (another hit man) was sorta funny talking with Billy Zane, his handler, ummmm. Terence Stamp was supposed to be dead, but ended up still alive in the end to save the young couple. Yeah, well, you have to see this movie to believe it. British humor. This is not helpful. Little wonder I'm only the second reviewer of this movie. I don't think too many people have much to say about this movie."
4,Nice Looking Fake Gold Watch,"This is a great looking watch and seems to be very reliable. It's large and heavy and looks pretty classy. I wasn't thrilled with the strap, however. Felt really stiff and a little cheap. Plus I thought the white stitching was a little busy on an already flashy piece. I replaced it with a high quality croc glossy strap and think it looks much better. Hopefully the ""gold"" finish holds up in the long run."
5,"Short, to the point and right on the money",Excellent book - it covered important brand-new parenting topics and presented many good ideas that are referenced in many other reputable sources but without unnecessary wordiness. The book is small enough to be read in a few hours by other family members and friends.
2,36 Things that might be good in your baby's first year.,"The title of this book should be""36 Things that might be good in your baby's first year, and 64 things that might not.""The hard part of reading this book is determining which ones are the good things and which ones are not. There are some that are just not good advice and it makes me wonder about all the other ones.Also, it is important to know where the authors are coming from. Both authors had twins, and one had three babies within 12 months. That is just not standard, and it causes them to recommend things that are not best for parents of a single baby.I have read about 10 books during this pregnancy and this one was my least favorite so far."
3,Big screen TV table,"Easy assembly and a good fit for a 56"" TV. Good design to make cabling less obvious. Put it where you want it before loading on the TV because it doesn't move easily."
5,Excellent,"This stand fit mySamsung HL-S5086W 50"" DLP HDTVperfectly, and matches the television's look and feel."
4,TR50X3B TV stand review,My main interest in this tv stand was due to the price. I wanted a stand but did not want to pay a lot of money. This tv stand compliments the look of my new dlp tv and is the focal point of my living room. No complaints at all pretty solid stand to. Can't beat the look for this price and i havent noticed any unusual dust accumulations out of the norm. I am very satisfied with my purchase of this stand.
3,Adjustable Samsung TV Stand(s),"Very Very Strange! I purchased the Samsung TR-500X3B from Samsung two weeks ago--$218 then,today $249. I compared it with the TR50X3B, then $249, today $240 and found them to be the same with the exception of the dimensions. The TR-500X3B was very slightly larger. Even the customer service rep could not tell me the difference.It arrived in good condition only missing one necessary washer. Tricky to put together as the instructions are vague. The VCR/DVD player fits fine on the glass shelf. My only complaint is that is does not fit the 56"" Samsung DLP exactly. The bottom of the TV is off the stand about 1/2"" on each side."
3,In the end looks great and saved money,Box came very beat up with holes in it. Most of the hardware was missing. Ordered replacements and told it would take a couple weeks. Local hardware store had everything I needed though. Once together it looks great. Assembly was straight forward and easy. I'm Happy with end result. Saved money and it looks great. 3 stars only because of hardware issue.
3,Adequate,"I bought this stand because it was the reccomended model for the Samsung 5686 DLP TV I purchased. It is nice quality, and went together very easily and looks nice as well.Like the other stated below, there is little room for equipment. The AV receiver I purchased would not fit on the top shelf, so I had to put it on the bottom and it just barely fit. No doors on the front of the unit either which is less than preferable.Overall its a nice stand, fits the TV line well, but If I had to do it over again, I probably would have went with something else."
3,Samsung TV Stand,"This stand fit the Samsung 61"" TV perfectly but I found it very difficult to assemble. (And I used to be a 767 pilot.) Also, it would be nice if it were on casters. The stand and TV are very heavy and difficult to move if necessary. Otherwise a fine unit and even my wife likes it."
2,Very Disapointed...,The stand was very hard to put together. Took me and my husband 2hours. And also I don't think it was worth the price. I have a 56 in TV and I think the stand is too too short.
5,Beautiful Stand,"This stand is very nice and I'm glad I got it, but beware my only complaint is that my Samsung HT-TQ85 XM-Ready Five-Disc DVD Changer Home Theater System hangs out in the front a couple of inches. This isn't the manufactures fault of course but it is slightly annoying. I didn't by this item from Amazon when I bought my Samsung HL-S6187W 61"" 1080p DLP HDTV from Amazon the stand wasn't in stock. So I went to Best Buy which had it at the same price as Amazon. So I figure with Amazon's shipping and NC State tax I probably came out close to even. Anyway the Stand was easy to put together, no problems there and it matches the TV perfectly. No complaints just a beautiful stand for a fabulous TV."
4,Excellent Product and Service!,We received our DLP TV stand in record time. We had wanted to get it for a new tv that was being delivered that weekend. We ordered on I think a Tuesday and it was at our office on Friday. It was in excellent shape and we had no trouble putting it together. The tv fit perfectly!
1,Stand for Samsung TV,"BAD:All 100% wood parts came with damages, 3 pem-nuts in countertop got wrong thread.GOOD:We are affraid to scream or talking loudly at home now, because this stand can felt down and ruin our TV"
2,You can do better for the money,"I'm not sure what I should expect for more than $200, but I wasn't very impressed with this piece. The hardware stripped very easily and they don't even provide you with any spare screws which you would think they would for such a big piece. Also, I don't think there is very much support for the bottom glass piece. I have a very large receiver on the bottom shelf. It barely fits and I am using a separate piece of wood for added support. Overall, this piece just doesn't seem to serve its purpose, other than hold a large television. You'd think that you'd have more space for accessories like DVD player and receiver, but it's really not well-crafted."
4,Great stand for the Samsung HDTV,"We went for this stand for a consistent look with the TV which has a great glossy black finish. I was not disappointed. The stand is adjustable, and fit our 61"" TV just fine. The assembly instructions were good, and two people assembled in under 30 minutes. Two people are not required.The stand is light, has a modern look with glossy black finish and smoked glass shelves. The ""so called"" cable management system is merely a few cable straps, and we did not find those very useful."
2,not real happy,"the table is much smaller than i had expected. the shelves are weak. if you have a surround sound system, not all the components fit on the sheves. i'm using it to get by right now, but i'm about to look for a better table. any suggestions?"
4,Like a Hand In a Glove,"If you buy a 50"", 56"", 0r a 61"" Samsung DLP, ""ice the cake"" with this stand. Fits like a hand in a glove and is a must have to complete this big screen package. It was easy to assemble, east to follow instructions, and everything that was supposed to be in the box was there. A little pricey at $250 hence the absence of a 5th star, but for what you're paying for the DLP, worth every penny."
3,Sturdy but not useful.,"Good sturdy stand, took a while to put together with the help of a friend, capable of 1 person to put together. Fits my DLP TV perfectly, only complaint is the shelves are so small I can't fit my dvd player or other electronics on it because it's not deep enough. The glass shelves are nice but collect dust which is very visible and the rubber pads that go underneath have come off several times. Decent stand, but don't buy if you want to put electronics on it that have alot of depth."
4,Samsung DLP TV Stand,The stand matches the TV perfectly (I have the HL-S5086W). Assembly is a bit involved. I'm a mechanic and it took me nearly two hours to assemble. Assembly is not for the faint of heart. It is very strong once assembled.
4,Great fit,"Looked around at different stands in best buy and circuit city and they all wanted about $300-$400 for a decent stand. I got this one and I am pleased with it. The only thing I wish it had was glass doors to protect everything from dust. I find myself dusting the equipment every 2-3 days. It is durable, very nice looking, matches my t.v. perfect (samsung 1080p, 61"" DLP HDTV) I can fit my Direct t.v. reciever, my center speaker, my x-box, my stereo reciever and a DVD player on on the 2 shelves. Good stand for the money."
1,did not come with all parts,the stand did not come with a single screw or bolt to put it together and been trying to get hardware for it for 6 weeks now.
4,Good stand for the money,"Pros:* It has a nice look and fit for Samsung 56"" DLP TV* Very fast delivery and good packing (no damaged pieces)* Good assembly instructions, took me about 1.5 hours to assemble* Amazon had the cheapest price and free S&H; when compared to several other electronic sales websitesCons:* Surface can easily scratch when pulling out of box and sliding TV on stand* TV screen seems to have slight forward tilt, not sure if it's the stand not being planar, as I don't own a level* Glass shelves show dust more than a wood stand* Shelves allow 2 components (Cable box, DVD Player, etc) per shelf, make sure yours will fit"
3,"Good stand but for 61"" TV, may be little small","I got my 61"" Samsung TV and this stand. First the stuff I liked, I think it's of good quality with nice shiny finish. Assembly was not that diffcult and the instructions were crisp and clear. It fits the contour of the TV nicely and viewing height is nice.However, the odd things about this one is like, this is a 50"" stand, trying to be a 61"" stand. You have the extention parts to make it look like 61"" stand but then the glass shelves looks to me few inches shorter. I would think the glass size should have been larger for 61"" configuration. Another minor thing about this is that the TV easily slides down on the top surface (may be bit too shiny/smooth top;)), the resistance is minimal. So watch out if you have smaller kids and if they play near the TV."
3,the stand,"good stand and it looks nice but since its adjustable...there is a slight flaw...if you want the glass to look like it does in the picture then u have to get the 50"" and no bigger because the bigger u go the more the glass looks out of place"
4,DLP TV STAND,"It's very beautiful and bigger than I expected. The only complaint about this stand is the surface is super slippery. I need to buy something that will prevent the TV from sliding off, you can literally push the tv with your little pinky. Other than that, it's an excellent purchase."
5,Very Nice,"If you're going to buy a stand for your TV you might as well get one that is designed specifically for that TV. This attractive stand coordinates beautifully with the TV and is considerably less money than others I priced.And, the quality seems good.One caveat is that it is a bit cumbersome to assemble. But, the results are worth it."
4,Nic Stand for the Price,"The Customer's Reviews for this stand on Amazon really helped me decide on wether to buy this stand. And I am quite happy with the purchase. The stand is quite sturdy and easy to assemble. The reason I gave only a four star was because the design could have been even better with the dark tined glass doors in front.But for the price, this is certainly a great buy. For the same price, you get almost nothing at the electronix/furniture stores.."
2,Beautiful but not pleased with customer service,"I purchased a 61"" Samsung 6187W from Amazon, together with this stand. The TV arrived a day or two before the stand. When the stand arrived and I began putting it together, I realized they had provided me 2 left legs and no right leg. I immediately called Pinnacle and was told the right leg was being shipped and would be delivered to my home in 3-5 business days.After numerous emails and cancelled satellite HD TV/surround sound installation appointments, I finally received the right leg more than 2 weeks after my TV arrived. Very disappointing to have a huge TV, sitting in a box in your garage, just because someone mis-packed the materials for a stand.Even more disappointing to be told initially the correct part would be received in 3-5 business days and then have emails go unanswered for days after that, before someone finally responded and shipped the part."
3,Never Say Never by Claudia Jameson (Harlequin Romance Large Print Hardcover),"Description from the book back cover:""You're not my type,"" the dynamic Adam Francis had assured Jane Winters at their very first meeting - but that statement wasn't exactly borne out by his subsequent relentless pursuit of her! But for personal reasons, Jane just didn't want to get involved - and she made the fact plain. After her unhappy experience with Billy, she didn't want to risk getting her heart broken again; and besides, there was the problem of her father ... But Adam was very persistent - and he always got what he wanted. Would Jane be able to resist him?"
1,Warning: This book is nothing like the Liar's Club,"I couldn't wait to read this book after tearing through Liar's Club in less than a day. What a disappointment this book was! This book almost seemed a little too far-fetched. I often found it too unbelievable, especially the drug use and her almost too vivid memories while high. Could she really remember what everyone was wearing and which way the floor was was swaying when she was high 30 some years ago? I doubt it. The glib writing style is the same as the first book, but the touching memories aren't!"
1,This book is soooooooooo bad,"I will 100% agree with the person who says in their review is this the same author of The Liar's Club? I REALLY, REALLY liked that memoir. I don't know what went wrong with this one..but I didn't waste much of my time trying to figure it out."
4,They still had it in '82,"Having seen TYA four times live plus their turn in the Woodstock flick, I can say that the band was as tight as ever for this gig. Alvin Lee, however, seemed a bit more reserved here(if facial grimaces are any indication)than I recall him earlier. If your an old TYA fan this DVD will not disappoint. If you've never seen or heard of them I'm sure you'll wonder why none of those FM classic,""roots of rock"", pseudo-hip stations never play them. Really, how many times do you have to listen to Stairway To Heaven or Freebird in one's lifetime?"
3,If You Are a Musician,I am really disappointed in this DVD. Who did they hire to film this show? It had to be a rookie or at the least a non-musician. Had I had known all they were going to film was Alvin Lee's face and his right hand I would have just brought the CD. Alvin Lee is a wonderful guitarist and a great technician and the camera man hardly ever took any body shots of him showing off his versatility on his instrument. He did with the bass player BUT HE WASN'T THE STAR OF THE SHOW!!!! The music was great. TYA was tight. The live show was impressive. I just thought the camera work could have use some improvement.
4,You Got Me Runnin,"Alvin and his men (band) are in top form in this reunion concert.If you like Ten Years After, but never saw them live, this is a goodvideo to have. We that grew up in the 70's and saw them for like $15.will have some great memories watching this."
1,I never recieved my order,"I don't have a review, because I have yet to recieve the book or my refund."
3,quite biased,"A good read but a bluntly biased book. The motivation inspired by such a book can easily have a negative influence on ""the cause"". I wouldn't have been surprised to have read comments like 'Rap has been a tool of the white man to corrupt our youth' .Take care when reading."
5,Wow!,"This book is mind-blowing. It tells the story of the greatest tragedy in human history. How could the cradle of civilization- the home to all culture and religion- fall into ruin as it has? Chancelor Williams will tell you.The book is uplifting as it recounts the glorious history and culture of our blessed ancestors. But then the book is depressing and anguish causing as it tells the tale of our destruction, which was at the hands of European white ""Ice People"", but also with the connivance of our own kin, which makes the tale even sadder.Only through education, knowlegdge and pride will we as a people reclaim our glorious birthright. You have to know the past to have a future."
4,Destruction of Black Civilization,"This is a book that gives specific details about the causation of the demise of one of the greatest civilazations on earth. The book begins in ancient times and gives names, times and places of what happened. It puts classism and racism in a broader perspective than what is usually shown."
5,One of the most Valuable History Books of our Day,"This book represents an ambitious effort, and the author shows himself equal to the task. Aside from the sheer volume of information presented, this work is significant in that it shows the circumstances of Afrikans from the perspective of Afrikans. Perhaps we will someday learn to see the world through our own eyes and to interpret what we see through our own historical experiences. This book will be an excellent place for anyone who is so inclined to begin to do precisely that."
4,Lots of info,I like all the information in this book. I read it for a class project some years ago. Just ordered it for a friend. I think he will like it as much as I did.
3,Ambiguous,"Can't quite get my arms around the validity of much of this material. Engaged in some independent research and was only able to verify a fraction of what was written. However, this is a very provocative subject and I am thankful that Mr. Williams attempted to present facts regarding Africa's origins which are rarely, if ever, are explored in mainstream America."
4,Fine piece of Insight,I feel that C.W has done a very good job in his research and impartial breakdown of an oppressed nations history. PEACE BE UNTO HIM and for more insight into the false Monarchs and Preists one should read; The Promise Key by Gangun Guru Maragh
5,"Anyone heard of ""Captain Beefheart""???.........",........I know The Blues Xplosion has because he's all over this album. I dig it.....so will you!
2,A little tough to use,"When you hook up a battery (at least for a T61), the connection doesn't always seem to be that strong. It may take a little fiddling. But I don't think there's any other option out there."
4,Dis- Review,"This is a pretty good CD. It seems that about half the time, the music is slow and melancholic, with dry, jangling guitars. At other times, it is heavy and dissonant. The band manages to avoid the usual, boring ""alternative rock"" approach of switching from light to heavy. The music has hooks, but it doesn't rely on repetitive catchy choruses. The best songs are the ones that build to dramatic climaxes. Some songs (especially toward the end) don't seem to really go anywhere, but they at least end within 2 minutes. The lyrics are especially amusing."
2,OK but the material is too hard against the body,"Received as expected. The blocks are functional but are the material is too hard to use against the body to maintain the pelvic area lifted, it hurts."
1,Prejudice by any other name,"Despite the effort at ""balance,"" the book caricatures the position of the world's religions on sexual morality. The crucial difference between sexual orientation and sexual action is destroyed. An anti-religious screed disguised as a prim anthology."
4,Excellent read,"""Fire Lilies"" is a compelling read about two sisters and how they deal with the changes in their world as they know it. I found myself caught up in their struggles. Cynthia Massey weaves an intriguing tale of two families caught up in Mexico's volatile history. Highly recommended."
2,"Wonderful Comic, Terrible Presentation","The two stars are not indicative of the writing quality of these comics, which is superb and virtually unbeatable in the field of classic horror comics from the seventies. But the ""Essentials"" volumes that Marvel churns out are just that: the things which grant the absolute bare essentials of the comic. The worst part is perhaps the way in which the artwork has been presented, in a muddled and stark black and white printed on what is very much like construction paper. This complete lack of color makes anything hard to see, from simple conversations to, and most importantly, the confusing and shadow-filled fight scenes. Spend the money on the omnibus version in full color. Makes the experience of reading this collection about 50 times more enjoyable."
4,An interesting bit of comic book history,"Before buying this I had no idea Dracula was such a big part of the Marvel Comics universe. Now I know better. More importantly, it's a fun read. It reminds me of those classic Hammer horror movies. Not so much violent as creepy, atmospheric, and just a touch old-fashioned.Dracula and his hunters are the stars here. Drac is an especially complex character. The stories are a little repetative. Hunters track down Drac. Drac escapes. But the stories are still fun, still interesting.Two parts are especially worth noting: The first appearance of Blade in comics (before he became a dull half-vampire cliche). And Drac vs. Werewolf by Night.Recommended especially for comic fans looking for some history. Or anyone else just interested in a little old-fashioned scary storytelling."
3,Parts of it were good.,"This costume, like many, is made from a very thin material. It is not very flattering below the waist. The cape, gun belt, and boots worked fine, but I ended up buying a different shirt and pants to go with those parts."
1,"Too Expensive, Way to CHEAP of materials and looks nasty!","Bought it for almost forty dollars and it's worth twelve and I am being generous. It is not flattering at all. I am tall! So, this was really hard to fit in without my body looking odd. The costume was PEACH colored, not white nor off white! The boots were loose and just plain nasty. The Cape is made of a very thin, burp cloth like material, not this nice and thick material as shown in the picture. The belt is smaller than usual and it was all bent in the wrong areas since it was made of a cheap rubber. So, everything in the belt is made out of rubber, its painted over and its bent at wierd angles. The actual picture of this lady makes the costume look good! But the reality is that its WAY TO CHEAP LOOKING AND NOT WORTH WHAT IS BEING SOLD FOR. It is a Star Wars costume, I expected a better product for what I paid! I am extremely disapointed in this product and I WILL NOT RECOMED THIS TO ANYONE!"
2,looking for a new costume,"My husband bought this costume for me (from a different site,but it's the exact same) and it looks silly on. Nothing like the picture and not worth the nearly [...] bucks he spent, plus I'm pretty tall and have given birth twice, so a one-piece isn't for me. Oh well lesson learned. Now I'm on the lookout for something else."
3,Great color and price but odd odor,"Great price and nice to have a variety of colors. Each roll is individually wrapped. When the packages were opened I noticed an odd odor. Every color had the same odor. Good news is that although it wrap smelled funny, it didn't irritate my sensitive skin even using it daily for over a month."
5,Excellent Substitute for Pricy Coban,"This is good stuff - works just like Coban but at $2 per roll, it's 1/2 to 1/3 the price of Coban. If you need it in large quantities - this is definitely the way to go."
1,Just awful.,"This book is so full of factual errors, bad research, and half-truths it should have never been published. If it even had a few things correct, I would have given it two stars. Mr. Harmer takes his premise against porn and stretches it to ridiculous lengths to prove his specious point, while at the same time he is quite willing to gut the First Amendment of the Constitution. A fifth-grader could have written a more coherent and reasoned tome."
2,Great... if work is the force that gives you meaning,"This should've been subtitled ""How to Become a Workaholic."" Aslett is so focused on the idea of being a ""producer"" (read: a workaholic) that he never considers that some (most?) people's goal is not to constantly pile on more work, but to do the work they need to do as quickly and efficiently as possible so they have more time to spend with friends and family or in personal creative pursuits. Waaaay too much emphasis on the ""twice as much,"" none at all on the ""half the time."""
4,"Great book, if you're patient to get through it","This is one of my favorite Aslett books because he gets a little philosophical. His ""thesis"" is: the more productive you can be, the less time you will think about the problems in your life and the more rewards you will reap. Its not your typical time management book. Like Aslett's other books, he rambles, and rambles with antecdotes and stories but this book has less of that. What Aslett does accomplish is convincing the reader that people who do more have richer lives. I believe him and he does make a case for it! That's why this book is unique. The title of the book, however, is misleading. The author doesn't talk about accomplishing things in half the time...the book should be called: ""Do More: how accomplishing goals will give you a better life."""
5,A truly captivating story for all wanna bes and sailors,"From the introduction by Robert Stedman through the last chapter and demise of The Third Sea this book will capture and hold your attention. The blood, sweat and tears of the story will enthrall the most adventuresome reader .. those of us who would be like-kind sailors and those who are sailors of the mighty Main. Reviewed by Dave and Connie Pryor."
4,flowers in the dustbin,"this is a pretty splendid compalation type thing. the first half (spiral scratch) is really really lovely, a great documentation of early, wonderful, mayjor label hating punk, the secong half is rather muddy, but quite nice. or if you wish just get it for the lyrics to orgasm addict---your making out with the lady who puts the little plastic robins on the christmas cakes-brilliant"
5,Bracelet just lovely,"I just had this bracelet delivered on Jan. 31st. It is very pretty, truely the picture does not do it justice. It is a beautiful piece of jewelry which I am proud to own."
2,Not your typical werewolf novel,"Although the book has an interesting setting, the plot and character development are rather lackluster. Although the book has a decidedly unique plot and view of the werewolf, the majority of the book has an inconsistent writing style and characters that are easy to forget."
5,Joya de Luz,"Este libro sí que es una joya, la compilación de todo lo que dijeron los Maestros Ascendidos acerca de los ángeles! Lo más significativo de todo es el hecho de que el compilador indica de dónde sacó el material (para su verificación posterior, supongo), dando el grado de seriedad que este tema se merece, especialmente en estas fechas en que tánto se INVENTA a este respecto y que al desvío lleva a los incautos e ingenuosYo había visto una versión de este libro en una librería en mi país (la Filosófica de Caracas) de la misma editorial, y tuve la dicha de comprar el último ejemplar que había. La inspiración que de dicho libro recibí no puedo más que compartirla con todos los que me rodean.Ahora veo que ha salido con otra portada y con material adicional (porque está más gordito!). No puedo esperar para ver qué más incluyeron!"
4,Thought it would be 3D type,"I bought this for my wedding (we ended up not having the time to use it). It is very cute, but when I first saw this I thought the mold was 2-sided. It is actually only a 1/2 mold, meaning the back of the sculpture is flat. I'm still very happy with it, and plan to use it for my sister's (much smaller) wedding that I'm hosting at my house."
2,Try a little harder next time...,"Really laid back album. It's nothing that hasn't already been done a thousand times by west coast rappers though. Nothing really stands out as outstanding on this album. The production is alright but again, nothing stands out about it.Notable Tracks:Up In L.A.Four SeasonsMy Dream"
2,Mediocre,This may be fine for somethings but it is not good for what you would like it to do the most.There is to much play in the wrench and it will not undo a bolt correctly.It moves every time you go take it off the bolt.I have used many wrenches over the years and even though this is a stanley (I should know better) the reviews made it see like a good deal.Don't buy it you will regret it the first time you try to tighten or loosen a bolt.I did.
2,Stanley 90-948 8-Inch Adjustable Wrench,"I ordered this because some of Stanley's tools aren't bad for professional work. This one, however, isn't good enough.The wrench itself, overall, isn't bad. The handle is comfortable. But, the moving jaw just has too much slop and play for professional work. As a commercial/industrial electrician, this will round too many bolts and nuts. And, the more play that it has, the more grit and fine metal shavings collect in the slide and foul it from moving easily. I gave it two stars because it would probably do fine for a homeowner.I had to return it. So, I'm buying an Irwin, which I should have bought to begin with."
1,Disapointed,"I was anxious to receive a comparable rechargable battery for my Panasonic cordless phone that had twice the power and twice the talk time. The battery would not hold a charge, so they sent me a return label and promptly sent another battery. Unfortunately, the second battery gave the same results, so they suggested I return the item and they gave me a full refund."
1,Can't see a single image in the entire book,"Although one of the finest publications available on production selection of chickens, don't bother with this re-print. Get an old used copy. None of the photos are recognizable in the reprint. It was a huge disappointment."
1,"Product did not work, customer support was no help","After 4 hours of tinkering with this product to transfer my Windows XP files to my Vista computer and an ""online chat session"" with Customer Support I was still not able to make any kind of transfer. Customer support was useless.Also it is important to note that Customer Service told me that the software disk ""check for updates"" feature does not give you the correct updates! You need to go to another web link for that. I was furious that I had spent 2 hours already tinkering with the included software and update link to find out that it was outdated and would not work. Why they don't have the appropriate updates in the ""check for updates"" option of the included software is terrible product design.A big time waster!I am going to transfer my files manually with a flash drive."
1,do not buy this product!!!!!!,this software is awfulit moved drivers over to my new computer and effectively screwed up my computer with compatability errorsit made the cd rom drive disappear!!!!i had to undo everything and just use a flashdriveWASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Be afraid, be very afraid.","This also made my cd drives disappear and ever since I tried to use it my new computer has had compatibility issues with everything. I have been in tech support hell for over a week. And if you are using any Adobe products like Photoshop or InDesign, run as fast as you can away from this tremendous waste of time and money and sanity."
4,Laplink PC Mover Review,"I ordered a used version of PC Mover and found it to be relatively easy to use and effective. I was able to move all of my programs and files from an old laptop running Windows XP to a new laptop running Windows 7. The only minor snag was that my Microsoft Outlook personal files (i.e. calendar, contacts and email)did not move over. I plan on re-running PC Mover to see if I can accomplish this."
3,Is it a casebook or a collection of short stories and poems?,"This was my first year Contract Law casebook. It is a good casebook, although it should be about half the size it is. Looking through my assigned readings, I crossed-out approximately a third of the pages assigned as they were mainly poems, short stories, and excerpts of novels, including the grapes of wrath, and a reprint of the lyrics to Love Me Tender by Elvis Presley. For those who enjoy the extra-legal readings this book is ideal, for those who don't the readings will be half the pages actually assigned, and the real contract law portions of this book are competently done."
1,Giganticletdown,"WOW, what a disappointment.Gigantic let down. I can't help but ask how did these bands even get there. Megadeth, was the only little ray of hope at the very end(familiarity only), but not enough to make up for all the other acts. The pure lack of skill and ability combined with lound obnoxious noises, yep, there you have it. I was fool enough to pay full price. I am a metal fan, these all need to be recycled in the metal pile!"
1,Not even worth $1,"I came across this at my local Bob's deperment store for $30 in the sports section. Iooked at thinking it was pretty cool. I didnt want to waste $30 cause i really didnt need it. a couple months later at was shopping at goodwill. I found the same one brand new for $1, so i picked it up. when I got home I opened it the directions were simple. one i got it working the letters were all smudgey and looked nothing like the clear crisp letters on the box. This is not even worth $1 and it was a big waste of time"
4,The perfect Sibelius 5?,"This was Rattle before he became what he is today (e.g., Sir). And his Sibelius 5th was one of his first EMI recordings. I think that from then on it was downhill for him and for the quality of sound EMI gave him. This one, then, is exceptional because of the wonderful conducting and the range of sound accomplished. Nowadays, EMI seems unable to repeat the wonderful bass sound of this ANALOGUE(!) recording. The Nielsen is good, but the Sibelius is SPECIAL."
4,Accurate and comfortable digital themometer,"The Lumiscope 2210-214 Quick-Read Digital Thermometer fits comfortably in the mouth, is very easy to use, registers the result quickly, and seems to provcide an accurate reading of temperature (I compared it to the reading on a traditional mercury thermometer). The only small complaint is the low sound it emits when it reaches the final temperature -- the sound is so difficult to hear that I was not sure the final reading had been reached."
4,Amazing,This was my first book by Dara Girard and it won't be my last. Cassie hads some real issues with her weight but was able to see that Drake really did love and cherish her. Drake was a very strong willed person and did not give up on Cassis no matter what.
2,I didn't care for this book,"the whole thing was very dry to me. the mini-mystrey in it was pointless, the missing brother; pointless, the fractured relationship w/ the mother; pointless... the relationship ""issues""; pointless... i'm in move with her writing but she missed the mark with this one."
5,The tight phone.,"I think this is a wonderful toy or electronics for a kid 10 and up. this phone is fun,durable,and educational electronic."
1,Check the lamp warranty before you buy,"The lamp in my PB6100 only lasted 600 hours in economy mode.. quite a bit less than the 3000 hours quoted for it and the PB 6110 available now. The lamp warranty is 90 days or 1000 hours. (of course the 90 days came first...I don't watch 11 hours of television per day!) When I called Benq, the tech support said the average lamp life of people calling for replacements was 500 to 1000 hours. again, quite a bit less than what is quoted in the sales literature. He said I got the warrented life out of the lamp (90 days, I guess) and should be happy with that.By the way, I first had to e-mail to get a phone number, then waited on hold for about 25 minutes for the guy to say I'm SOL.So, instead of looking at a $400.00 lamp every 3000 hours, I'm looking at a new lamp every 600 hours, or *FIVE TIMES AS MUCH*I wish these guys would be honest about lamp life.Good luck, and may your lamps last at least half as long as ""up to 3000 hours"""
1,Nursing - home karaoke !,"I totally agree with the previous reviewer from Canada.I fear that Luther must be writhe in pain in his grave.The renditions by Sellin' Dion , Elton John, Aretha Franklin and Patti Labelle are beyond any belief : disastrous.All the rest is really mediocre and monotonously average.So,what are those so called big names doing here?There's only one exception : John Legend. He has personality, a good voice and he shows a kind of respect,trying to re-capture the true spirit of Luther's music.This is a hell of karaoke played in a nursing-home.Save your money ,do not look at the charts and wait for the next tribute album....come on,there are so many excellent producers around...Jason Miles,George Duke,Marcus Miller....I will stick with the originals."
1,Tribute to Luther Vandross,"Get Luther's Greatest Hits. Buy Fantasia's album. I'd rather hear Luther Vandross singing his own songs.Mary J. Blige, Alicia Keys, and Celine Dion are worth listening to. And Jamie Foxx surprised me. He certainly is multi-talented. The rest...eh! They don't compare with the real thing - Luther is so missed."
3,okay,i love luthers' voice but to tell you the truth CELINE DION is my favorite singer so that's why i got the album. i believe this is not her best work. i think they had her record the song very early in the day because her voice sounded like it hadn't stretched enough and it sounded too scratchy. all in all this is an okay album.
3,Remebering Luther,"So Amazing...An All-Star Tribute To Luther Vandross pulls together a great collection of musicians and singers. It is a nice mix of artists who influenced Mr. Vandross & who were influenced by his music. The best songs on the album channel inspiration from him while allowing the artist to inject their own styles. The best track on the album is a smoldering yet touching rendering of ""Love Won't Let Me Wait"" by John Legend followed closely by Mary J. Blige's emotional ""Never Too Much"" and a sizzling ""So Amazing"" by Beyonce & Stevie Wonder. Of course their are some big missteps like Celine Dion totally missing the poignancy of ""Dance With My Father"" and a misguided Elton John ""dueting"" with Mr. Vandross on ""Anyone Who Had A Heart"". Mr. John's heart is in the right place, but enough with the computer generated duets. All the artists on the album have to be giving kudos for their respect of a truly missed artist like Luther Vandross."
2,Only Luther can do his songs justice,I must say I am a huge fan of Luther and I am so sorry we no longer have him in this world.I was very disappointed in this cd and can only say no one but Luther could ever strike a song home but the man himself.My favorite Luther song of all time is A house is not a home. I wish Patti would have given it her best.Sadly disappointedcarol e.
2,Very Disappointed,"I have never been so disappointed in a cd in my life when I bought this Luther Tribute CD. Out of all of the songs recorded, I only liked 3 three of them. Aretha's verson of ""A House is not a Home"" was simply horrible. It would have been better had Dionne Warrick (the original singer) do it. And I didn't understand why some of the artists chose songs that Luther remade anyway, such as Always and Forever. Poor Luther! After this Cd, I know that I'm really going to miss his voice."
1,WHAT THE HELL,"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???? I AM SO SICK AND TIRED OF THESE HALF ASS LUTHER TRIBUTES. THE LAST ONE WITH MS HATHAWAY SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE LAST. HOW IN THE WORLD DID WYCLEF GET PICKED TO DO ANYTHING ON THIS ALBUM, MUCH LESS SING? JUST SAY NO TO BAD SINGING!!!!"
4,Remember this is a tribute!!!!!!,Come on guys...please give these incredibly talented artist some credit. This is a tribute to Luther Vandross not an I'm trying to sound like Luther CD . There is no one who can imitate his vocals or his amazing talent and that is what makes this a tribute. I think that each artist bought their individual style to his music in appreciation of his work and talent. I was reluctant to purchase this CD after reading the harsh reviews but being a Luther fan I was interested in hearing it for myself. I was quite impressed with the fact that they took Luther's classic songs and made them each unique and different without trying to show-off and make the song sound better than Luther himself. I commend them for that. For those of you who may not want to purchase the CD based on the reviews I say...listen for yourself. I did and I was not disappointed!!!
4,Nice Tribute!,"If you are a Luther fan, this CD is worth buying. Keep in mind that it is a tribute to Luther and not a CD of artist trying to sound like Luther. There was only one Luther!My favorite Luther song is ""Creepin"", so I was glad it was added on the CD, however my favorite cuts off this CD are sung by Fantasia and Alicia Keys. I liked Fanstasia's version of ""Till My Baby Comes Home"" because I could see myself jammin' to it in a club. I didn't care for the arrangement of ""Power of Love"" and would have preferred to hear someone else sing ""Dance with My Father"", but I'm still glad both songs were added to the CD.I believe Luther would have been proud of the contributions to his music by these artist. Overall, I'm happy with the CD and found it very interesting to hear all the artist put their own personal touch on Luther's music."
3,Ok CD,"This CD is not as great as I thought it would be...not all the guest artist's on this CD did justice to Luther's tunes, it would almost appear that I'm judging contestants on American Idol."
2,Missing in Action,"Artists MIA -Lisa Fischer, Ava Cherry, Nat Adderly, Jr., Marcus Miller, Fonzie Thornton, Diana Ross, Dionne Warwick, Cissy Houston, Reuben Studarrd.... and the woman responsible for his motivation to move from back up to up- front, Roberta Flack.Production MIA – True “Lufa” feel. This sounds like something the folks behind 101 Strings would produce….. BLAND!When’s the new – unreleased “Live” compilation recording of Luther’s concerts to be released? Don’t toy with serious fans with this garbage."
1,John Legend........he is the next legend.,"All I have to say is John Legend is the man. I bought this album ONLY because HE was on it, and HE delivered! Well done! The rest of the guys should have left it up to Luther."
1,This is really bad...,"If you loved Luther's soulful music, buy that; avoid this 'tribute' to his memory."
1,"No, No, No, and No","If you're going to do a Luther tribute CD, you MUST get ""real"" singers, not performers (I know they are rare these days, but if you go back pre-Beyonce, Usher, and Mary, they're out there). As a Luther fan, I have NO desire to listen to anyone but Luther Vandross sing ""Luther"" songs. His amazing voice is what made these songs classics.I'm all for people taking music and making it their own but, again, some of the artists picked can't even sing their own simple songs well without the assistance of hip beats, background dancers and a booty dance, so why would they even attempt a Luther song.My advice for any Luther fan is to skip this CD and put in ""The Best of Luther Vandross: The Best of Love"" CD instead."
2,where are luther's background vocalists?,"Where are all the spectaculars singers that were on vandross cds: tawatha agee, brenda white king, cindy mizelle, cissy houston, fonzi thornton and so on..They should have been there, and would have deserved a great place here. it's a shame! and marcus miller,Roberta Flack, Bette Midler :a disapointing project."
1,If there was an option for NO stars I would have chosen this,"I am so upset that I bought this, the only consolation is that I bought it on sale and plan on selling it to a local store that buys back used cds. It took me literally 17 minutes to listen to the entire disc, that is because if the song was horrible (and they all were) I would fast forward it to the next selection.I guess I have come to the realization that Luther is Luther and no one before or after will ever dare to compare not even if they are grammy award winning artists themselves."
2,"Luther deserves much, much better !!!","I almost got angry listing to this crap. Luther is the greatest singer we have ever had, and this is how we honor him?? What a shame!!In my opinion John Legend is the only pure act on the album. Stevie/Beyonce, Alica, Jamie!?, Usher and Babyface offer decent covers, but what the ... are Elton John and Celine even doing here, and what did Aretha think!!! .. this stunk big time!!Luther deserves singers like Anita Baker, Regina Belle, Howard H., Freddie J., Chico Debarge, BRIAN MCKNIGHT!!, D'ANGELO!! ... where are they?? I hope they get together and make a real tribute!!, produced by Marcus M. and Nat Adderly!!!Luther didnt deserve this !"
1,no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no,"No one can sing like LUTHER why would these (Some mediocre)singers try to sing Luther's songs? I was deeply saddened by his death and I am even more saddened that this album was made. This man with not only the beautiful voice and the wonderful way of arranging his songs, should not be copied. what his mom should do is get some of his never released tracks and tribute him that way. When this albums was completed didn't any of these artist think, you know none of us can compare to Luther, so let us not even attempt this. Maybe as a tribute put one of his songs on their next album, but not this way. I like some of Celine Dion's song but Dance with with my father.... come on!"
3,Its Different...... But I like it,"Ok everybody on the cd took Luther's songs and did them in their own way..hence a tribute...anyone thinking these artist could pull off the magic that Luther did...then you must be on something...John Legend....a standout on the disc came close....Donna Summer...the queen of disco..so what? you thought she was gonna do anything else?...lol..Angie Stone is also great...but everyone did the songs wit their flava....*even Wyclef With his Caribbean infulence* another what did you expect? It's a nice cover album. It would have been a horrible cd if these artists tried to ""do Luther"" because no one can.I hope you find this review helpful."
5,So Amazing,".An All-Star Tribute to Luther Vandross.We could not have lost someone so amazing to suddenly.The album just sums up the Best of the Rest!.It's so amazing to seat back and lesson to this amazing album.Luther we the fans thank you for giving us the songs and albums that are second to none.This album will blow you away.Please buy it.15 Great songs on a great album, for all you soul and R&B; lovers..."
1,There are some songs that shouldn't be remade.....,"Nice attempt, but sometimes you've got to leave well enough ALONE! A nice Luther tribute album is ""Forever, For Always, For Luther"". ""So Amazing"" is just a bunch of singers giving a poor imitation of Luther's songs. If you must waste your time with this album, cop it from a friend...for free."
1,Sometimes We Need To Leave Well Enough Alone,"I commend the various artists for wanting to pay a tribute to this awesome and legendary entertainer, but I'm sad to say that I was very dissappointed in this CD. If it wasn't for the fact that this was to be a tribute to Luther Vandross, I would have returned it and asked for my money back."
1,No no no,"Ok, Mary song was not too bad (she was not trying to sing to hard)Usher...no no no...leave it alone. I started to LMAO when I heard him trying redo a luther clasic, I guess they should have just left it alone. I must say Ray Charles CD is much better. Still LMAO at us-HER trying to sang this song. He trying his best but it is not working!....sorry. i few songs are ok, but they should have just left it alone."
3,I Miss Luther,"This was a great idea for a tribute album, but when I listen to it I only want to dig out my Luther CDs and hear it the way it SHOULD be done. I should have known after the last Hendrix tribute album to leave them alone and listen to the original. There are some good cuts on this disk but still not Luther. Save your money."
3,A bit disappointing...,"There aren't many people out there who are as big of a Luther fan as I am. I couldn't wait to hear what the 'stars' would do with this tribute album. I was really disappointed with the final outcome. My favorite song is Fantasia's version of 'Til My Baby Comes Home. I think Elton John is horrible, and Celine Dion just didn't do Dance With My Father justice at all. While I can appreciate what Wyclef Jean did with Always & Forever, I don't like it. Angie Stone's version of Since I Lost My Baby would be closer to my like than dislike. And I'm just shaking my head at what Aretha (my girl) did to A House Is Not A Home. Someone should have told her to just say ""NO""."
3,A Tribute to Luther- Various Artist,Remember...This is a tribute to Luther Vandross by various artists. These artist are interpreting his songs in thier style. They all worked with Luther at some time in his career.I must say that the highlights are Donna Summer and Usher.
3,"Just an ""OK"" tribute","Like many of the other reviewers, I'd hope that this tribute to Luther was going to be spectacular. Yet, it was mediocre at best. Beyonce and Stevie Wonder are great on ""So Amazing"" and Jamie Foxx shines on ""Creep"" but the rest was just bland. I'm still not sorry that I purchased the CD. If nothing else, it serves as a reminder that there was truly only one Luther."
2,And the reason for this CD was?,"This is the question for me. I truly love Frank Sinatra, but I didn't see anyone rush out and ""interprete"" Sinatra songs. Luther Vandross was a premiere vocalist; in a class by himself. Personally, while I love Patti LaBelle, Stevie Wonder, and Aretha Franklin, this is one CD that should not have hit the market."
3,Bland - So Amazing,"I was very excited to hear about this tribute being in the works, and when the cd released, I rushed to get it.Now the but..............one word...............BLAND.It's hard to explain, but just about every song lacks something.Mary J. does a nice job, but we all know she's capable of much more. In fact, I should say the same of all the artists selected to participate. Usher, also did a good job, like wise for Beyonce & Stevie, Pattie. But others? oh my so very disappointed. I simply LUV Ms. Aretha, but I was not stirred one bit by her rendition. And of all the Luther songs, why did she choose to tackle that one. I think they could have chosen better songs. The artist and song match seems to be abit off.Personally, I would have made this a double cd and included: Tamia, Jaheim, Rubuen, Anthony Hamilton, Musiq, to name a few.But that's my opinion, and I stand by it."
2,Summer saves mundane tribute,"Luther Vandross was a fantastic artist whose songs were full of passion and soul. Considering the incredible array of talent gathered for this tribute to one of music's greats, the results are somewhat predictable, by the numbers and rather mundane. Instead of siezing the opportunity to truly make the numbers their own, most of the tracks are rather boring straight forward covers, and some such as Aretha Franklins, are downright terrible. Only legendary Donna Summer manages to rise out of this quagmire and deliver a truly inspiring, upbeat version of The Power Of Love and that alone saves this tribute."
1,No one can sing like Luther,"I am sorry to say that no one came even close to Luthers soulful voice and vocals, the songs on this tribute sound horrible,the only thing I learned from this tribute is that Luther was a true artist and legend. If you want to pay tribute to Luther Vandross buy all his previous CD's his voice is amazing!!!!!! Don't spend your money on imitation when you can buy the real thing!!!!! Luther you will be truly missed!!!!!"
1,Cris,"I would like to comment to ""BREN"", Baby you hit it on the nail. Your comments are very entertaining, please do us all a favor and keep up the reviews. I always look at reviews before purchasing and with this one I would have wasted a few dollars.:)"
3,Snooze fest,"I am so dissapointed in this album... So many great singers not delivering.. Guess it says alot about the 'new kids on the block' not able to deliver a 'real' songAretha's version of 'House' is beyond bad... it might be the worst thing she has ever done and almost an insult to Vandross. Talk about a Tribute...geezall the newbies, Beyonce, Alecia, Fantasia etc. sound just bland and boring.Some of the verterans do a better job, but still not great. the only track that made me not return this cd is the Donna Summer track. Not a greatfan of her music but she has an amazing voice and it's the only song that makes you think of Luther with a smile on your face. The way you should remember someone.. so Thank you Donna!"
4,incredible,"Ok, let me say that I genuinely liked every track on this cd. Mary J Blige knocked my socks off, and made ""never too much"" stick in my heads for days. Fantasia on ""til my baby comes back to me"" also made me simply smile. Those were the most entertaining tracks to me, but Wyclef Jean's dance interpretation of ""always and forever"" was brilliant, patti labelle did ""here and now"" true justice, and I thought celine dion's ""dance with my father"" as heard from her performance at last years grammy's was perfect and the emotional highpoint. Other reviews may not agree about celine agree, but take my word for this one, and the disc is AMAZING!"
4,Donna Summer really stands out,"Among a group of well known and multi million seller artists the one that really stands out is Donna Summer. Her redintion of Power of love is fresh and new although respecting the author. And what to say about her voice, at the age of 50+ she soares with a voice getting better, strong and mature every year. This one song only really worth the cost of the CD. It's time for her to get back with a full CD of her songs.As for the others I like Usher's ""Superstars"" singed with voice and soul and Baby Face and Mary J. BligeLet me say unespectedly Aretha's song is the worst of the album."
4,great sunglasses,These sunglasses have just the right amount of tint. Not too dark. Comfortable. Comes with a great case.
3,"Re-edit of ""Gunsmoke Blues""??","Great performance, as usual, by Muddy Waters, in color but a bit washed out. I think the show on this DVD is a re-edited version of the material on ""Gunsmoke Blues"" (filmed by the crew of the legendary western-RIP James Arness).That disc offers much of the Muddy performances, along with songs by Big Mama Thornton and others. This DVD is an 8 tune Muddy set from 1971, with George ""Harmonica"" Smith, Sammy Lawhorn, Fuzz Jones, Big Eyes Smith, and Pinetop PerkinsGunsmoke Blues"
3,"this is a harsh book, but still a good read","Beldazare(Zare) Forturini was mistaken in his judgement of Laine Belfour, he thought Laine was money hungry because Cristofro (Cristo) his young brother asked for some money to give to Laine, but Laine was Elaine, and so was her mother the family just called the daughter Laine to stop confussion.Zare sent for Cristo who became very ill, and Zare called Laine to come to see Cristo. But because Laine gave all the money she had to her parents so they could go to New Zealand and Australia, so she didn't have anymore money, she pretended to stay in England because of a young man she had met, but this was just to get her mom, and dad to take her money.Later Zare comes to England to see Laine, and he makes her come to Italy with him, because of his sick brother, and he will pay her way.Laine is always asking about Cristo, but Zare gets angry when she does.Soon Zare sees the real Laine, and he knows she isn't after anyone's money.Now Zare is after Laine's heart."
1,Do not buy this edition of Hamlet,"I have no beef with Hamlet. This review is only about the version of the book. Amazon advertises it as the Folger edition, but what you actually get is some crappy book that has abbreviated names and huge spaces between lines. There are no line numbers or footnotes. There isn't even and Act or Scene header at the top of the page to remind you where you are. Whatever you do, don't fall for the 9.99 trap and instead buy the Folger edition."
2,Disappointed,"I needed Hamlet for school and i when i received this copy i was disappointed. The Characters are abbreviated, there is too much spacing and when i tried to site it there isn't enough publication information. I probably should have gone with the Folger addition because its just the best but i didn't. Learned my lesson. The cover is cool though..."
2,This edition not as described on this page,"I don't have a beef with Shakespeare, but with the presentation of this version of Hamlet -- the description (as noted if you look closely) is for an entirely different book, the Folger publication (which includes notes, glossary, etc etc). The book pictured here is solely the play. Fine for if you're putting on Hamlet and want to act it out, but not as helpful as a reference."
1,Great Play Bad Edition,"Hamlet is one of the greatest plays ever written, and you should absolutely buy a copy and read it. But you should not buy this edition. There are no line numbers, the character names are abbreviated, and the spacing is weird. Of particular concern for students and others not familiar with the play is the lack of footnotes to help provide context or clarify difficult language. I wish I had thought to read the reviews before I purchased this edition."
3,At least it had a skull in it.,"Man, this English was older than my mom. I was like, ""What is this?"". The only redeeming part of this obvious rip-off of the Lion King was that there was a skull in it."
1,Atrocious Kindle Formatting!,"The formatting on this product for the Kindle is atrocious! Everything from font changes every few lines to the speakers names in the middle of the page! Avoid until this is fixed, the formatting makes it almost unreadable."
5,Best edition available.,"As one who collects editions of HAMLET, I can say without reservation that the Arden (2nd edition) is the hands-down best edition you can buy of the greatest work in our language. The notes are as complete as can possibly be expected, and offer the best insight I've yet to see concerning the various ""problems"" in HAMLET. Its comprehensive look may be too much for a person approaching the play for the first time, but for the serious student of HAMLET it's essential."
5,Hamlet,I LOVE this Shakespearean tragedy and this is an excellent edition. I'm very pleased with the item. It is exactly as described. Thank you.
3,A Misleading Title,"The Arden third series Hamlet should have been titled Hamlet, the Second Quarto, as is shown on page 139 of the paperback edition. Folio-only passages could have been shown in the body of the text with superscripts, as is done for the third series King Lear, but the third series Hamlet doesn't do that, and instead puts the longer folio-only passages in an appendix. Any edition of Hamlet that does not include ""...I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space...."" in the body of the text is not my idea of a good edition of the play. The third series Hamlet may be a wonderful version of the second quarto, but I'm glad I've kept the Arden second series version of the play."
3,"Great Concept, but...","I found this wagon online first and then found it at the Toys R Us. I was really excited to find it as I have not seen any other kids with this yet and I wanted my son to be the first to have one. My neighbors were impressed by the look of it but others don't quite know what it is. It looks really cool, but there is one major flaw... The handle is heavy metal, when you let the handle loose it can come crashing down to the ground. This handle could hurt a child if it hits them and especially if it hits their head. The handle is already cracked because it's hit the ground so many times. I like it, but I am thinking about taking it back for a regular wagon. I would like for my son to stay put on the seat, but with this type of wagon he can just step out of it at any time unless you use the seat belt. As well, my son did not seem that interested in this. This wagon does not have any storage space, only a cup holders. I think I am going to return it : (PS- I did return it."
5,A must read!,"Letters of a Leatherneck by Cornelius Vanderbriggen is a wonderful,true story about War War II. Cornelius Vanderbriggen tells of his walk with the Lord and how many soldiers while on the battle field found Christ!"
5,another overlooked gem...........Where are these boys now?,"I'm giving this 'mini-album', 5 stars, mostly for it's staying power. These songs will resonate in your head,long after listening to them. ""Tupelo"" is simply empowering. ""Beehive"" is the obvious ""standout"",for it's crunchy guitars,and breakneck-speed;The most ""rocking"" track ,in this collection.Most of the remaining tunes, are slower,yet more atmospheric. Joy division comparisons aside........If you ever loved: ""Into Paradise"",or the dramatic wonder of ""The Chameleons"",this cd is worth your attention. The singer's voice IS a bit of an aquired taste(no more so than Geneva,or Molly half-head,remember them?),but that makes the sound,that much more personal...Don't ya think? A snarling Pit-Bull,with a tulip 'tween it's fangs,this one is."
5,Outstanding and different view on how Europe got to WWI.,"Very informative and thought provoking book. Imperical data such as France trying to motivate a draftee company with only 8 regulars vs Germany using 20 career soldiers for the same size unit. Good and logical treatment of how the powers did and did not adopt the Machine Gun, telephone, radio, and other developing technologies. This is a solid reading for anyone interested both in how Europe went from ""No war for Morocco"" in 1905, to ""Germany will March,"" in 1914. Other books talk about the powder keg that was Europe, 1914. This guy introduces you to each keg as it goes into the pile. I've read 40 books in the last year on WWI, starting from Dreadnought and going to Keegan's latest. This book is one of the top five. You really want to read this book if you want to know the how and why of 1914."
3,Eforce cellphone data cable,Eforcity USB Cable for Motorola Nextel i930 / i920 / i870 / i860 / i855 / i850 / i836 / i830 / i760/ i730 / i733 / i710 / i670 / i205 / i305 / i315 / i325IS / i530 / Nextel i875 / i885 / i880 / i833 / i736 / i605 / i560 / i325 / i355 / i275 / i265 2004 ...Cable and drivers load without problem. However I thought that a data backup program was included. To get that functunality you have to purchase another software program or suite to transfer data from phone-to-phone or backup contacts.
2,can't use it,The cable fits the phone and the computer but it is worthless if you can't download the software to use it. It came with a CD that supposedly took you to a website to download the software but it only takes you to a website that sells cell phones. I looked everywhere on the website for a link or something that said you could download any kind of software but there was nothing. If all you need is a cable then it is great but if you don't already have the program on your computer to use it then it does no good.
1,DOES NOT WORK FOR LG UX5000,"This item is not compatible with my UX5000 cell phone.The drivers offered do not even match LG's websites [...] list of compatible drivers for this phone. I guess I will have to buy to 'official' cable to get anything to work.I'm sure this works for some other people, but not for me."
3,"Works as a charger, but cannot transfer photos","This item works great to charge my phone, but the reason I purchased it was to transfer photos from the phone to my PC. I've tried and tried, but cannot transfer anything."
5,Fresh aire from the lands of the Celt,"At the Scottish Irish Festival in Estes Park, I chanced upon this band performing in an out of the way tent, and the enchantment not only captured my imagination, but also my heart in their music. Every song is a delight. The recording is well mixed and sure to get your feet tapping down to your soul!"
4,"I'n ""In like Flynn!""","I was introduced to this group via AccuRadio.com... these guys rock! You needn't be a celt to dig it.Listen to ""In Like Flynn"""
3,A good read,"I was happy to read this book because as an American Methodist I am not as familiar with Methodism in Great Britain. It was a way for m to learn about what is going on there in our church. I found many interesting points but struggled a bit with the many contributors.J. Robert Ewbank author ""Wesley's Ways"" and ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the Isms"""
4,Great Bath Toy,"These are fairly awesome. Being able to mix and match to create some little people on the bathroom walls is something that my son, who just turned two really enjoys. He likes the fact that they stick to the wall and I like that he doesn't have to stand up in the tub to play with them. The only thing that I wish, was that there were more heads and clothes, so he could really be creative. There are only three shirts, two pairs of pants, three pairs of shoes, and two heads. I really wish they had put a few more of each in to really allow you and the little ones to have fun creating people. But overall, I thought it was a great toddler toy for the bath tub. he's outgrowing his 'baby' bathtub toys and I have been looking for something more his speed now.I wasn't disappointed."
4,wife went crazy,"My wife must have bot 4 packs of these for the grandkids, and they really have a ball w/ them."
4,Great for the bath,"My grandson loves playing with these stickers while in the tub. He puts them all over the bath walls. I should have gotten him some that were more boyish, but he does not care. He enjoys rearranging the stickers. Makes bath time even more fun."
3,kind of boring,"I thought this would be a great toy for the bath. It only contains 2 people - 1 boy and 1 girl and only 1 real outfit each. Definitely would be more ""fun"" if there were multiple options. Doesn't hold my son's attention very long."
2,Not as expected,These Bathtub stickers don't stick to the bathtub very well so my grandchildren only play with them outside of the bathtub.
5,Great for Kids!,Great for kids! Great in keeping kids occupied in tub & one is enough to keep your kids busy & occupied in tub.
4,Fun!,"My daughter will sit in the tub and play with these until the bath water is freezing and her hands are like prunes. All the pieces fit into the bag it comes with, but it's a little tight for a 4 yr old. I usually have to get the last 2 or 3 in for her. But, that's better than cleaning up all of them! Good toy!"
2,Dated Thriller with Interesting Backtory,"The backstory surrounding ""Criminal Law"" is more interesting than the film itself. Infamous Canadian Schoolgirl Killer Paul Bernardo was obsessed with this film and with Kevin Bacon's twisted character Martin Thiel. Mr Bernardo even changed his last named to ""Teale"" shortly before his 1993 arrest, in a bizarre nod to this mediocre film. Gary Oldman plays hot-shot Ben Chase, an Attorney who manages to get Thiel aquitted of murder charges more than once. Thiel, a preppy son-of-an-Abortionist, loves his clothes, boats, and doing creative things with flaming diapers. Tess Harper, Joe Don Baker, and Sean McCann play the cops in earnest, but this is Oldman and Bacon's show. Neither is especially successful here: Oldman, with a bad 80's haircut, is wild-eyed and soaking wet for most of the film and Bacon lacks the depth to play his role. Christian Bale did a much better job playing a near-identical role in ""American Psycho,"" a better film than this."
5,Criminal Law,"I'm a fan of Kevin Bacon performances. This storyline had some interesting twists and plot developments in it! Not a happily-ever-after drama, but it did present some things to think about!"
2,Nice ideas. Not so nice recipes,"I love the title of the book. I love the pictures. I love the ideas it has (esp. the chocolate cabbage). But at least a few of the recipes haven't worked for me. I've made the cabbage cake at least 3 times and I've given up on the sponge cake core. It comes out pretty dense, and I use another sponge cake recipe.Another recipe, chocolate honeycombs, says to mix the wet and dry ingredients and then cook to a simmer. With twice as much dry as wet ingredients, there is no way you can simmer this.So I would actually recommend the book, but take everything it says with a block a salt."
2,Just the first impressions.,"For a book costing around $75, and that even after a rebate of in excess of $22, in terms of layout, binding, print quality, and paper quality, it is an absolute disappointment. Having spent that much money, I was hoping that just the production quality would make me keep turning the pages until there was none left to be turned; I must admit that in terms of that particular aspect alone, it has proven to be quite the opposite. For the list price, I would have difficulty picking it up and going through it knowing how much had to be spent in order to get ahold of it. Overall quality, not just the quality of the content, of the item has to be in line with the price tag; in case of this particular item, that's just not the case."
3,Rolodex 82340,My favorite feature is the fold-out style adjustable pages. Least favorite is how hard it is retrieve cards from the pockets.
3,solid disk,"I purchased this disk primarily for Venice is Sinking and a couple other tracks I'd heard on local Canadian stations and was pleased with the overall quality of the music. Folky, melodic, upbeat and easy listening are how I'd describe the songs. There may not be a bunch of great tracks of fallen in love with since the purchase but there are a host of tracks that I actually listen to instead of skipping ahead to something else and that I've found is saying something for me with the thousand plus songs on an ipod."
3,See Kyle Jones Review but more info.,"Agree with Kyles Jones's review ""starts fast, runs out of gas, coasts, then... no resolution"". From my attendence at the World Science Fiction in September 2000 I know that Kyle did correctly conclude that The Depths of Time is a series. There are 3 books planned. Next the author plans to complete the next volume of the Hunted Earth series but that might not be published until 2003!"
4,Well written,"I agree with other reviewers that the book seems to be longer than it should. It goes into excruciating detail at different scenes (e.g, opening battle), but in most cases I actually found this interesting. I enjoyed most of the book, although the end leaves you hanging. But this is not surprising for a trilogy, is it?Most importantly for good reading, it was very well crafted and was populated with realistic characters. I found the underlying science of the time travel rather obscure (like much of the science fiction I seem to read these days), but if you can accept this premise, I think the story is interesting and well worth your time."
3,"Good ideas, but a bit long","In the acknowledgements, the author thanks his editor for allowing him to stretch his single book story into a trilogy. This will not go down as one of said editor's crowning professional achievements. The story is interesting but, once you make it past the beginning sequence, the effort to stretch it into a trilogy is obvious. The middle of the book is full of filler and drags on for far too long.It also bugs me a bit that, when it becomes obvious that Solace is dying, it never dawns on anyone to simply ask Earth to send timeshaft ships to evacuate the whole solar system. Wouldn't leaving be the simple answer to their so-called life threatening ecology crisis?"
1,A disappointment,"Unfortunately, this book did not live up to its fascinating premise (time travel through wormholes) and the ""teaser"" synopsis on the back cover. It begins well, and the first 90 pages are excellent hard sci-fi. The book quickly degenerates into a poorly disguised pulpit for radical ""environmentalism"", however, with the hero discovering a model to unfailingly predict catastrophic environmental degradation. The essence of this story is that climate models are always right, and the empiricists are always wrong. The novel contains profound elements of eco-conservatism and a lot of poor science. Among other things, apparently the author didn't know that algae was a plant, and produced oxygen. In sum, I strongly recommend avoiding this book."
2,Depths of patience,"I read it a second time because I couldn't remember what happens at theend, only to realize that that had been because nothing happens at the end."
4,Yesteryears in Uruguay,"This is an interesting book which reflects the first-hand impressions of an English immigrant to Uruguay. Highly recommended for all those interested in the history or rural life in South America's southern cone. Though somewhat disjointed, the book is a detailed, often-humorous outlook on how a foreigner must have felt when confronted with local idiosincrasies and habbits. A sort of 'Hitchhiker's Guide to Uruguay' of the early 1900s, it takes the reader through a variety of situations which the author himself experienced and how he often muddled his way out of them. An entertaining read, though the value of the editor's long and rather boring prologue is highly questionable."
3,Pulsar wrist watch,"The watch is very stylish, but it is extremely large and required me to pay to have it made smaller, (I have large wrists). The other problem with the watch is the clasp is very difficult to open and close. I am hoping the clasp will loosen with use. My previous watch was also a Pulsar, which I have had over 20 years and it's clasp was easy to open and close and no adjustment was required in the wrist size."
5,Great book for beginners!,"I received this book with my very first McSpadden dulcimer, and it's quite good! It lists the notes by fret numbers, which makes it super easy for people with no musical knowledge to follow along and learn. The book also lists the notes for those who prefer to read music. The twenty-four songs included in this book are a wonderful cross-section of the various tunings and styles that are popular with the dulcimer. I highly recommend this book, and also recommend that buyers take this book to a local printing store to have it spiral-bound for easier reading while playing."
4,Nice Spoof,"I love indie movies. It takes a visionary to create something like this from scratch. I love the James Bond Series. I picked this up with ""Tommorrow Never Dies"". A few million dollars can make a nice movie, but creativity can make a movie priceless. Good work guys. 4****. Waiting for the next spoof! Later : )"
2,A Disapointment,"I must say I was very disapointed with this film. I'm not sure if my expectations were too high, or my sense of humor is way different then those who made this film. Either way, I would suggest that you rent it first before buying.I thought much more could have been done with the independent film. I felt the acting could have been better as well as better props and sets. However, it's obvious that the director has a knowledge of Bond films. The names of the characters as well as the plot were very ""Bondish"".Being a musician, I was impressed with the theme song. I thought that was just great. But other than the cool tune and the opening credit sequencing I was disapointed."
1,Deserves a negative star!,"This is such a bad movie, do not waste your money or time! Even as a spoof it is far from funny!"
3,You Only Die Once 007 Spoof,Item was shipped and received in an expediant manner. Packaged in near perfect condition as promised. No complaints. 3 STARS...the storyline is HORRIBLE and the filming techniques unworthy of the James Bond/Ian Fleming name. A five year old could take better video shots as this picture proves to us!
3,Not exactly accurate,"Like the other reviewers here, I was disappointed to see that there weren't any recent pics of John Robinson or his victims including his former wife Nancy. The author does go into detail about how smart John Robinson thought he was and that was interesting. However, I started to wonder about the accuracy of this book when he mentioned Ed Gein as an infamous Chicago serial killer when in fact poor old Ed was in Wisconsin when he committed his horrendous deeds. Ed Gein was one of the most infamous killers in American history and not to have this one persona accurately reported left me wondering how much the rest of the book was accurate. In all honesty, I don't think this is a book that true crime fans will enjoy once they read that."
2,not the best...,I have been reading a lot of these types of books recently but this one was almost too badly written to finish. It went on and on about insignificant stuff such as descriptions of the political scene at the time. Also not very good in the picture department.
4,I think it works,"I always read reviews before buying a product but in most cases people just write ""this product is great"" but it hardly gives me any idea about the skin type of the person who is writing the review. So I decided to write a full description of my skin type. I am 30 years old, have moderately sensitive, normal skin, I would say I have better than average skin. Sometimes I do have pimples but never had acne problem. After using this product for two weeks (2 times a week) I saw some changes. My skin definitely looks fresher. I had some pimples on my forehead they were gone after two applications. My pore sizes are smaller but I am also using a face mask from body Shop so I am not sure if that has anything to do with it. But I would definitely recommend this product"
3,5 minute jump start for your skin,I bought this because I heard so much about it and maybe it was BECAUSE I heard so much about it that I was kind of disappointed. I do love the fact that it only takes 5 minutes though. It makes me be more regular about using a mask which is good no matter what.
1,Don't waste your money!!,"This mask does nothing to your skin!!Maybe it is just me,but I doubt it! I am 28 years old and have dry skin. I will never buy this again!!!"
3,"I like the fizz, but can't say I've seen any noticeable results","I have very dry skin and this is a very gentle cleanser. It doesn't dry my skin out at all. It doesn't cause any noticeable irritation.The product is a gel, but when you apply it, it foams up and fizzes. I quite like that sensation. I find that it applies much better to dry skin than wet. The gel needs to be able to cling to your skin or it'll just slough off.I've been using it 2-3 times per week for about three months and honestly, I can't say that I notice any difference. It's kind of fun. It smells good. It doesn't dry my skin. But at this price point, I won't be purchasing it again."
5,cleans and softens skin/keeps skin looking younger,I use this several times a week and since I started I hardly ever get blemishes. My skin looks brighter and younger. My face feels softer.
1,Just a lot of air!,"I was really let down by this product. The concept of it is great. The benefits of oxygen have really been pushed by skin care professionals as of late... so this product would naturally be a hit. I've had the Bliss Oxygen facial and it's AMAZING. I also use their cleansing milk every day.So after my facial, I decided to give this a try. My skin often feels congested, as if it just needs to be ""aired out."" The packaging is a great pump that seems like it's of a high quality. The mask comes out as a peach-ish gel that quickly starts to foam up. This part is kind of cool. The sensation of all the bubbles on your skin is almost energizing itself... but the actual results left me wondering why I spent 54 USD on this mask. I gave it a chance and tried it again a few days later... still nothing. My skin didn't feel any smoother, nor did it look any better. Masks are intended to provide visible, if not temporary, results and this one fails."
5,The best Amigos Invisibles album!,"This new Amigos Invisibles album is their best after their debut album ""A Typical and Autoctonal Venezuelan Dance Band"" 1995. (not available in the States)This album has more dance, funk and afro-venezuelan percussion with a touch of lounge music.It invites you to relax and dance. To chill out and dance once again!!!Excellent music made in Venezuela!"
4,A Potent High,"The three lives are beautifully interconnected and you can't help realize it's the product of a well-researched screenplay (Dibakar Banerjee,Kanu Behl). The camera-work(Nikos Andritsakis) is a welcome initiative although it's not thoroughly innovative.The pace is good thanks to a water-tight script (Urmi Juvekar) and the running time of approximately two hours only serves as an advantage.Most of the newcomers have been pushed to give a good performance and some of the applaud goes to the director(Dibakar Banerjee) here.The dialogues are sharp but at times a tad stinging to the eardrum.There's a lot of negativity in the film, and maybe it's due to the nature of human psyche but the bickering and bashing don't fail to entertain you for even a single minute."
4,Marie's Back,"For those who may not know, Marie Fredriksson is the Swedish power songstress from the 80's pop group Roxette, which she co-fronted with Swedish pop veteran Per Gessle. 'The Change' is her first solo album in English since the last offering by Roxette.I purchased the CD hoping to hear more of the kind of soulful introspection I enjoyed on her tracks with Roxette. And I'm happy to say I was not disappointed.Granted, among Roxette fans, there are those who gravitated more to Per's upbeat happy-fun music, and those fans will admittedly find less to like on this album. But for the rest of us who want something a little more substantial in their music, Marie delivers in spades with this work.Highlights of this album for me were 'Love 2 Live' and 'Mother'. Heartily recommended."
2,love the singer/ not her choice of songs,Marie has a fantastic voice but I am totally disappointed in hersongs. Her voice is so powerful and the songs just don't make use of it.
1,A major dissapointment,"A very personal album, obviously. But it has no hooks or melodies to acompany the lyrics. The production is odd as well. Having loved all of Marie's solo albums in the past (even though in Swedish), this is a major dissapointment."
3,Not for me...but it might be what you're looking for,I didn't really enjoy this book because it was too basic. I wish I could have seen an excerpt before buying it but I returned it so I'm only out of the shipping.This book is good in that it is professionally done and contains good pictures and overall health information not just info on abs BUT on the flip side that's what I don't care for about the book. I already have other books for that. The exercises are okay but it's more a general fitnes book with an emphasis on abs. I was looking for a more hard core book on targeting abs assuming I already had the basics of fitness down. I feel it's probably good for a woman who is new to working out and has the abs as a trouble spot. The pre/post natal section isn't all that too me. Plus several of the exercises require a trampoline (something I am not going to buy just to get nice abs)
1,Powerful Artist Deserved Better Writer,Roxanne Swentzell is a unique and powerful artist and the plates in this book are well done. This art deserved a much better writer. The author Fauntleroy has no background or expertise in Native American or Fine Art and her text has many factual errors and suffers from a lack of understanding of art and Native culture. It is also poorly written. Publishers should have hired a Native American author. There are many who would have had the ability to put this exciting young artist in the proper context.
1,Please Do Not Buy,"If you are a CCNA student and plan on using this as your single source for tests you will be greatly dissapointed. I have read both this book and the old version since I have taken the CCNA course twice now. This book contains only about 80% of the test material... The older version is much better and contains twice as much information. Anyone who is serious about taking the ICND or CCNA Exam should NOT rely on this book... Please take it from someone who knows. This book was obviously thrown together too quickly, there is quite a few gramatical errors and missing information. Two Thumbs Down ""If it aint broke don't fix it"" stick with the old edition."
2,Disappointing,"I have to say that although the first two books in the CCNA Companion Guide series were good (CCNA 1 Networking Basics and CCNA 2 Routers and Routing Basics), each being 400-500+ pages long with detailed information, the last two companion books (CCNA 3 Switching Basics and Intermediate Routing and CCNA 4 WAN Technologies) have been stripped down to 200+ pages each but still at the same price as the first two!This is in stark contrast to the actual course material which can be seen in the CCNA ICND self study book is much more rigorous and detailed than the CCNA Intro self study book. This tells me that the 3,4 companion guides should also be much more detailed in order to prepare the candidate adequately.Not worth the money."

2,KU basketball games,This DVD did not have the greatest games on it as it tries to advertise by its title. It wasn't worth the money.
3,Not as fast as I'd hoped,"I was doubtless too optimistic. Replacing a standard speed SanDisk 1 GB SD chip in my Kyocera Finecam SL400R, I see no speedup of CCD transfer to this chip. And no speedup of USB transfer time either."
5,Greatly Improved,"This card works much faster in my Canon S3 and in my card reader. The additional storage size from my old 512 cards is nice, too. I am able to shoot faster in burst mode and formatting the card or erasing pictures is incredibly fast. I usually shoot in the largest file size and superfine setting. This card is quite fast. I have used the card in some fairly hot temperatures after the camera sat in my closed car. No failures yet! Overall, I wam quite happy with the Extreme III cards."
2,For 6 months worked fine. No my laptop cannot read it.,"I bought this card for $ 92 6 months ago. Everything seemed to be fine until today when I tried to read stored pictures and PDF files using my Kingston TraveLite reader. My DELL Latitude D800 laptop with Windows XP didn't recognize it. I cannot say it is a problem with the laptop nor the reader since other SD card, including Sandisk Ultra II 2GB work very well. I tried to format it in a linux machine but nothing seems to work. The only device able to format/read/write the card is my Canon S3 IS camera. Is a shame I cannot read the pictures from the memory directly. Now I have to connect my camera to my laptop to be able to read the pictures."
2,Can anyone combine shipping?!,"Product is fine, but why purchase from a seller that charges exhorbitant prices for individual shippin?!"
4,U.S Grant,"A little dry, but packed with information!!! He was an iteresting guy and ahead of the times in his thinking."
4,For Civil War History Buffs,Detailed and very readable.Would like to have seen more aboult his personal struggles when stationed in Calif. and before returning to the army.
3,"Interesting, but wished for something else","Finished Volume 1 and mostly through volume 2. I appreciate reading about the Civil War from Grant's perspective... but as a result there are a few things missing from the typical Civil War story we know, most notably are any mention of most of the actions of the Army of the Potomac - understandable, but don't expect a great overview of the war (he was mostly in Tennessee and Missouri). The books are also very focused on each specific battle. WIthout in depth knowledge of the terrain and geography, I found myself skimming through parts. At times, Grant very briefly gives his opinion on slavery (bad) and other officers (good and bad), but he doesn't philosophize much. It's really more about the battles and military maneuvers than anything else. If you have an in-depth knowledge of the battles of the Army of the Tennessee you'll probably appreciate it more. Still a worthwhile read!"
3,prepare to skip,Lots of boring stuff in it about him getting married and other mundane things. People dont look up to him because he visited a cave while in Mexico; they look up to him because of his military career and then presidency. He gets bogged down in the less exciting aspects of his life and breezes through the exciting stuff with little detail.
1,i was forced to read this,this book is the most boring book i have ever been forced to read and i read for like 2 weeks and it was only 5% finished and now i have to read the second half homeschoolers beware
3,"Grant writes of his account of the ""rebellion"" aka ""the war between the North & Southern states"" over slavery","U. S. Grant writes of his participation in the U.S. -Mexican war & his voluntary participation in the ""rebellion"" It is recollections of him starting out as a leutenant & his progression to a General. It is a history lesson of the battles he participated in & the politics of the era."
4,rockin' good bagpipe music!,"If you like bagpipe music with a beat, this album is definitely for you! A rockin' good time every time i put it in the cd player. you can't help enjoying it as the porridgemen wail on the pipes."
2,Instructional Planning; A Guide for Teachers,"Agreed, the book is easy to read and presents the instructional design process in simple terms. Unfortunately-- too simple. The text lacks depth and is therefore not worth the price. There are better introductory texts available for less $$."
3,Hisonic VHF 4-Channel Wireless Microphones HS8888,Fair value. Somewhat cheaply made. Battery door broke on first time installing the 9 volt battery. Had to tape it shut for the job. Antennae are standard cheap ones which can break easily. Performance was fine. No static when all 4 were being used for Karaoke. Possibly consider their next level up.
1,The firestone tire-makers of Memory Cards,"How does intec get away with this? They KNOW they make a defective product, but they don't care because they make money. This car will erase ALL data, do not buy at all. Don't take a chance like I did, don't think ""oh, it won't happen to me, i take care of my memory cards"" you will nbe left out to DRY and you will lose EVERYTHING. how bad was my case? 9 years of madden 2004. 9 franchise seasons, gone in a blink of a second. Do not buy, Intec should be ashamed."
1,don't buy this product it sucks!,"if you buy this product it will eventually corruput. I had i franchise for Madden 2004 last night i woke up this morning gone. I had it for a year and it corrupted twice. I was looking foward to playing in the Madden 2004 superbowl, but this no good electronic messed it up. DO NOT BUY THIS CRUDDY PRODUCT THAT THEY CALL A MEMORY CARD. If you stuck a piece of paper in the memory card slot it would work better than this. ONLY BUY MEMORY CARDS THAT ARE MADE BUY NINTENDO!!!"
1,WORST PRODUCT EVER!!!!!,I bought this product and the first thing it does in corrupt. All of my data was GONE i had to start all over ONLY BUY FROM NINTENDO NOT INTEC. I HATE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!
4,intec bad,never use intec stuff it can ruin your gamecube thats why sometimes your power light will go off beacause intec stuff ruins your gamecube
1,Doesn't work,"When I put this memory card in the slot and then turned on the power, the power light illuminated briefly and went out. It didn't matter which memory slot was used. Luckily, when I removed the memory my Game Cube still worked. But I can't save games. I have a Game Boy Player attached but I don't think it has any thing to do with this. I am going to get a Nintendo memory card. This is my experience with this item."
2,A great group lending it's name to a crap CD,If you want a CD like this just buy a CD writer and copy 10 seconds off of every CD that's made the top 10 charts in the last 6 months. Pretty much the same thing as this CD has to offer.
4,Eclectica--not your usual velvet beatmix,"A great mix CD, the sheer variety of genres and tempos keeps it fierce and interesting--most DJ comps emphasize rave or house. Liam Howlett doesn't sweat smooth technique so much as a rough and rugged feel. If you're into this, you've got to check out Portishead DJ Andy Smith's ""The Document"" and David Holmes ""Essential Selection"". Crackin'."
5,Liam Howlett shines,"People who come here looking for a prodigy cd, don't expect anything. This is basically Liam Howlett releasing a mix CD of his own via the prodigy name and record label. The mix-tape is simply awesome, he really blends things well, and i have friends who are breakers who just adore this CD. Liam knows how to not only make good beats, but also create good beats too. Buy this if you like DJ-ish type things and what not. Don't get this if you wanna hear that normal prodigy stuff. Of course, if you're a real fan then you'll just buy about anything."
4,INTERESTING,"This is not what a Jilted Generation fan would expect, though the mixes do provide some heart and gave my cd player alot of work. They do let out all sorts of interesting beats and sounds. I would recommend this album to all of the eclectic people."
5,This proves Liam is the best DJ around,"As if he ever needed to prove anything!! A lot people think the Prodigy is just Keith, but to any true MUSIC fan, they would realize that Liam Howlett is the most creative, inventive DJ in the industry today. It took me a few listens to warm up to this, but now I'm really glad I purchased this. Much better than the Chemical Brothers latest IMO."
4,Good Job Liam...Way to get yourself out of the POP genre!,"I'm sorry, call me old skoool, but I can't listen to Liam's ""Fat of the Land"". That album is a ""popular"" album, and it resembles none of the break beat standards that were set with ""Music for the Jilted Generation"". ""By a T-shirt, keep it underground( I qoute Dj Keoki when I say this).So, with that out of the way, I was happy to hear about this DJ mix album, because I knew it wouldn' t be a pop album... it would be a underground album. A good one at that, I might add.All the mixes are fairly clean, no real alterations from liam, its like he cut out sertain peices of cool songs and pasted them together and added a beat. Its really cool, Track Two is my favorite with the Janes Addiction remix.All arround cool album."
1,"disjointed, mis-guided, and worst of all tedious","If this is a stroll through his record collection, it looks like he dropped them down the stairs. This is fine, if it was a bootleg, but it is a disgrace this was sold as a legitimate ""new"" album. Well, the record companies again have sent out anything to keep the masses happy.Boycott wasting your cash"
2,What Happened Prodigy?,"I listened to the sound clips, and it sucked! Whatever happened to stuff like the album ""Music For The Jilted Generation?"" That was there best work. Prodigy does not need Grand Master Flash to help them sell a cd. I am very disappointed in Prodigy for...such...such crap!"
4,Sorry...this is a grad cd..but somting not right,"Ther somthing not right...i thing Liam Howlett can do muds beter then this....but it is a realy inderrestnig CD...it take a litle time to now what is going on, on this one, it's like intro cd..Chemical Brothers dit do it muds beter."
1,This Album is no where near the quality of the other CD's,The only good part in the entire cd is the first 25 seconds of the first song. The rest of the cd is so bad I wonder how the managers of Prodegy allowed the Cd to be released. This CD makes me question what ever Album the prodegy makes next I will most certainly buy it with caution.
3,"Good, but not stunning...","I expected a bit more from Howlett. The beats here are good, but I've heard all this music before -- I also grew up on Grandmaster Flash, Sex Pistols, Hancock's ""Rockit""... Come on, transcend -- draw on but don't simply rehash. It's fun but, it could of been so much more!"
5,Deep into the brain of Howlett.,"This album is not what I expected from Liam. I thought it'd be a mix of modern dance tunes, but when I fired it up I was shocked and suprised. Throbbing synths, scratch, hip-hop, deep bass and great mixing add up to a brilliant album that gets better each time you listen to it. For all those die hard Prodigy fans out there, they will be enlightened as to Liam's tastes and roots in music, plus they may notice some secrets. The breakbeat from Charly is in one of the tracks, as is the orginal Smack My Bitch Up line, plus a tiny moment from Molotov Bitch plus Poison ""properly mixed"" into the album. Final words, brilliant and enlightening."
2,Makes me wince,"Wow. This cd was bought at a cheap store and consequently i got a cheap mix. Liam Howlett is a dj who should stick to taking three second samples and messing them up into the big soup of the prodigy's next original album. for all of you who thought this was the prodigy it isn't. it's liam in his basement fiddling about with his turntables and making a record that is his favorite music. it would be an interesting record if he could actually mix, though. if you want a great mix cd but the chemical brothers 'brothers gonna work it out.' if you don't think so...email me and we'll have a nice little chat."
1,Grasping at straws,"...The book is choppy and reads like a comic book. Nothing has been proven. Nothing ever will be. Creation and evolution advocates will argue until the end of time. Neither will win, however, because there is not enough evidence either way."
4,A calm and winning introduction to kindergarten,"Anne Rockwell's calm ""Welcome to Kindergarten"" is a winning way to introduce any preschooler to the idea of what comes next in the way of schooling. Tim, a little boy about to enter kindergarten, goes to the school with his mother--he's clearly nervous and comments on how foreign everything is, and how big the furniture, halls, and classroom are. But after his teacher has had an opportunity to show him around the different classroom areas (art, science, reading, math, and so on), Tim finds that he's more than ready for kindergarten--he's positively excited about it.Rockwell's simplistic paintings accompany concise text and they complement each other beautifully. The colors are strong and clear, the details just right, and the movement from one classroom area to another helps to mimic what an actual kindergarten school day will be like. Just right for young kiddos who may harbor a little nervousness about that all-important first day!"
4,Kindergarten book,My granddaughter really like the book. But she is a little advanced for her age and she grew a little bored with it. But she still likes it.
3,Very Good~~~~ But Not Her Best,"I really enjoyed this book. As others have stated, learning more about Ash and Simi was the best part of the book. I didn't ""feel the love"" between Zarek and Astrid. Now Ash's story, that is a story to wait for!!!!!"
4,Zarek,"This one had more fun, sarcastic humor, and fatastic creatures then any of the others so far -- and Zarek is the sexiest Dark Hunter so far. By far. I enjoyed the Alaskan setting and SK's vivid descriptions of Zarek's history, his feelings, suffering, and -- triumphe :)"
5,Calling all Mythology and Paranormal Lovers!,"I loved this! It's only the 2nd book in the series I've read - the first was Night Play which is only mediocre at best - but now I will have to read more books in the series. I love how she ties in classical mythology with the vampire and werewolf myths - it really works here. In this book, the 2 main characters are likeable and their relationship and love scenes aren't gag-inducing like Night Play and others in the genre I could name. You really get into the story and care about what happens to the characters. The minor characters - like Acheron and Simi - also add interest to the story. I look forward to finding out more about some of these characters in her other books. A great read!"
3,Great book!,"This is a great book, but unfortunately not one of my favorite Dark Hunter. I loved the new information about Ash and the Simi, but by the end of the story became more wrapped up in that than the actual affair going on between Zarek and Astrid.I found that I just couldn't relate as well with the characters in this book, probably because they weren't mortal. In the previous hunter books, Kenyon does such a wonderful job of pairing, every day real to life female characters, that this one was difficult to warm to. It is still wonderful. The Zarek character is wonderfully written and just as I imagined from Night Embrace. Keep up the good work."
4,Great,I enjoyed it. I have read the other two books and they all fit together. Looking forward to more form this author.
3,Not what I was expecting,"I wasn't expecting to like this installment in the series, mostly because Zarek is not the most charming of Dark-Hunters. I was pleasantly surprised! I ended up like this quite a bit, despite Zarek's surliness. It helps if it hasn't been *too* long since you read Night Embrace (Talon's story), because there's a lot of reference to Zarek's part in that book. There were a few things that didn't make sense to me in this, not the least of which was the story behind Astrid's blindness. She's supposed to lose her sight while she's judging someone, yet she can use her ""companion"", Sasha, to see. Isn't that cheating? Regardless, this troublesome little detail isn't enough to get in the way of the true purpose of the story, which is to tell a love story about the gods."
1,Excessive Violence,"Ugg- This was horrible. If you have any pity or compassion in you, skip this one! I can't believe it's in the romance section since I can't remember a single part about the romance. I did not need to read in graphic detail about the horrors inflicted upon the hero as a small child - ""maimed"" would have covered it.I'm so disappointed - I really enjoyed the other books before this one.I'm throwing this one in the trash."
1,Simply awful,"Honestly appalling and truly underdeveloped as a concept, the plot of this book had so much potential. At its core, it is a classic romance/thriller setup: the innocent heroine, driven to help the surly handsome man with his dark past even as he pushes her away. The author's intention to spice up the conflict by developing her ""Dark-Hunter"" race and throwing in some mythological references is perfectly fine. The book could have been positively delicious if it were well-written at all.The fact is that this author's writing style is clunky, heavy-handed, and rife - no, DRIPPING - with cliches. Her dialogue is insultingly cliched as well.This author personifies the reasons why so many people make fun of romance novels - it's ill-concieved and badly written. The only thing the author seems to have spent time on are the sex scenes. She certainly didn't research any mythologies or her setting (Alaska) ..."
1,Dance with the Devil,"Please don't waste your money , this is the most boring book I ever read.My classification is ""minus 5 stars""."
4,More than just a romance novel,"""Dance with the Devil"" is my favorite of Kenyon's ""Dark-Hunter"" series so far. A large part of the novel is dedicated to character development, and the characters themselves are much more complex than previous novels. It was very interesting to watch Zarek develop as a character, making the (albeit, inevitable) conclusion very satisfying."
1,not for me,"This tape is exactly 10 minutes long with the same recording on both sides. All it says is, to sit up straight, hold your book up and scan the top of the words with several practice sessions. You decide if that is worth the money for this tape. I believe there is more informative tapes out there."
4,A cute little technique that worked for me !,"You settle down with the cassette, a sample book and a pencilto measure your speed. You measure your reading speed once before'enlightenment', he then enlightens you with the technique, and you measure yourself again.For me - I really did double my speed, without having to do that finger-pointing thing!The whole tape really is just 10 mins long, which makes ...[it] seem a lot of money, but then the technique seems to work. Needs practice though, or you slip back to old ways...Probably worth a try if (like me) you lose patience with the long rambling speed reading books on the market."
1,Totally useless,"After going through the audio cassete, I can definitely say that I cannot double reading speed in 10 minutes. There is absolutely no logic and technique. It's just a waste of money. Please do not buy this book and suggest the author to do meaningful stuff."
2,a really bad product,"You think by doing the things he says on this 10 minute tape is going to change the way you read, well, you are gravely mistaken. Personally for me it did not work out at all, even after practing, I tried, I really tried, but to no evail. He's not quite a good teacher; and for all those who did find this tape usefull why haven't you written ""how"" it has changed the way you read, and not tell me what you did during the tape? I felt that the author wrote those good reviews. Very harsh acusations, i understand, but its just what I experienced."
1,Suckered...,"What a scam! The more I concentrated on the so-called tangerine the more I regressed. If you want to double your frustration in 10 minutes, then I recommend this."
3,"Ok, but not great","This was usefull in trying to pick out a name for our baby (on the way), but i wasn't that impressed with the quantity or the information provided on each name. Would have liked more focus either way (or both)."
1,Nothing of interest here,"Every entry is identical. Tells you nothing of interest. The one thing you want to know, what the name means, is hard to find, if it's mentioned at all. Very disappointing."
5,Top Series of 2005,"This is a smart, gritty series set in present day New York City. The main character is a retired superhero who becomes mayor. The plot alternates between his superhero past and political present. Tony Harris' artwork fits the story and he provides some striking full-page panels. I enjoyed this so much that I started Vaughn's other series 'Y: The Last Man'. ""Ex-Machina"" is perhaps my favorite current series and I'd highly recommend this to people who usually don't read comics."
2,A letdown,"I was really hopeful that Ex Machina would be a good series, seeing as Y: The Last Man was such a masterpiece. What I found was just a political piece about pro-homosexual views and running the ""ungovernable city."" The main character seemed like more of a vehicle for a politically motivated piece than anything. He had a weak back-story, and seemed to be a cookie cutter character. I enjoyed Y: The Last Man, and even though it had lesbian scenes in it, it was warranted. There were no women in the world! It also didn't try to rub the fact in your face. To say it is a letdown is being nice."
5,Great start,"Great comic. Reminds me a lot of Y: the last man, which makes sense considering the author. YTLM is one of my top 5 favorite series, so the comparison is intended as praise. Also has some similarities with Watchmen with the criminalization of the hero and such.Also there's a few cool extras at the end which show 4 stages of the creation of the art from reference photos the finished product."
3,a little confusing,"the artwork is interesting but realistic drawing styles don't really interest me, the story is good but it is a little hard to follow at times"
3,"Great story, terrible graphics","The art really gets in the way of a great story. Seems like 90% of the art consistes of faces in closeup delivering dialogue, which is a huge snore for anyone who appreciates the genius of artists like Derek Robertson. The visuals in Ex Machina looks like Tim and Eric's ""Tom Goes to the Mayor."" Blecch. Makes me sad to think of how fantastic a whole product this could have been with the right artist."
5,"Ex Machina, Vol. 1: The First Hundred Days","Good book interesting concept with the super power being the ability to talk to machines; and yet the writer kept the main character non-robotic, in that he is still a human with human frailties."
2,huh?,"I just finished vol.9 and I still haven't got a clue as to what this story is about. What started out as an interesting trip into how a hero decides to forsake his power and become an ordinary man trying to better the common good through political office has devolved into an alien/preternatural attempt at world takeover and the destruction of the human race. The original plot line had humor and personal drama, this not so much and I'm wondering if I should bother continuing on with it.So, if you start reading this because you like Brian K. Vaughn be warned. Each volume reads ""nice"" but there just doesn't seem to be any depth, or direction, to it."
4,A new twist on things...,"If you are looking for some off-beat humor, action and politics written intelligently into a unique story then this TPB is for you. A super-hero who may or may not be a super-hero. Volume one collects the first story-arc from the Ex Machina on going series (issues #1-5)It is original in it's concept as a man is given the power to control machines. When his first days of heroics go poorly he decides to run for mayor. He wins and that's where the adventures really begin. This is written sharply and draw superbly.Definetly worth checking out."
4,Superhero comics ain't always about superheroes,"Well, the best ones sorta are. Watchmen, Squadron Supreme, Wanted, Authority and Top Ten. If you're still telling your friends why they should read these (even if they won't) then I strongly recommend you check out Ex Machina. There's a strong super-hero component to the story, but the focus is on real world concepts like freedon of expression as seen through the life of ex-superhero, now mayor of NYC.Along with Sleeper it's one of the best reviewed monthly comics from the past couple of years that no seems to be reading. Here's hoping being collected into a trade paperback keeps it being published; I like getting my fix monthly. But I'll be buying a couple of these as gifts."
3,"OK, but just didn't catch my interest.","This series starts off with a weak premise (incompetent hero / vigilante becomes politician) and little to make it believable. In the right hands, this might be an interesting idea. But the protagonist would have to be more compelling both as an honest yet electable pol and as a motivated do-gooder. As it stands, he comes off as neither, and rather seems to be an everyman blundering from one remarkable stroke of luck to another. Perhaps the series picks up steam and complexity in later volumes, but I'm not willing to spend the money to find out. On the positive side, the drawings are crisp and well done."
2,Meh,"Some people probably rate Ex Machina versus the universe of graphic novels or comic books, or perhaps even including written sci-fi. This first volume likely stacks up pretty well there. I rate it versus a larger universe, where really great art is ... rare. In this genre, so far, there are, for me, two standouts:Watchmen, and slightly lesser, but still great,Batman: The Dark Knight Returns. This doesn't even come close, and would get, charitably, three stars.Now, price. I paid $10-ish for the first volume of many, which barely lasted me an hour of reading. You can have the complete sets of the above masterpieces for around $10-15 per. I'm sorry, but I'm not a comic-book guy, so this just feels slightly like a rip-off to me. Minus one star."
5,Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,"In this account of his adventures in the advance to Mexico City with Pancho Villa's armies, John Reed gives an excellent account of what it was like to have been there. Luckily enough for him, historians, and adventure lovers alike, he was on the winning side and survived to tell his tale. His tale is his aspect of the venture among the soldiers who fought the battles, rode the trains, suffred the hardships of civil war, and tasted the glow of victories won on the way to the capitol city. It's gritty, putrid, rough and tumble and the food isn't great but at the end you get a heck of a kick from surviving it all."
1,Do not buy the General Books edition!!!,"Do yourself a favor and do not purchase Insurgent Mexico as published by General Books. Please look further since this is a great book and should be read as intended by the author, not as published by General Books. Entire sections of the book are missing, the spelling is atrocious and the typeface unreadable. According to General Books, ""we have recreated this book from the original using Optical Character Recognition software to keep the cost of the book as low as possible. Therefore, could you please forgive any spelling mistakes, missing or extraneous characters that may have resulted from smudged or worn pages?"" Evidently I am not forgiving enough, especially since the book is available at a reasonable cost from other publishers. Caveat emptor!"
4,If only there was more,this book lives up to its underground billing as we are drawn into the Mexican Revolution in a way that makes us seem to be riding with Pancho Villa and living with the villagers along the way. It reminds one of a Hemingway report except with added detail. The only complaint is that it is not longer for it leaves you the urge to read more Reed.
1,Stay away from this book!,"This book completely spoils the pleasure of reading John Reed: every other word is a misprint; some phrases break into the margin of the page and end into nowhere; almost all chapters end in the middle of a sentence, which is continued (in the lucky cases) in the next chapter. Even the ""look inside"" pages are fakes: they are the pdf of an old edition, from which the present one was, with utter incompetence, re-typed. This is not a book, this is a distillation of desperate incompetence and blatant brazenness."
3,Okay tool,"Got this caliper and thought it would be precise. About .002-.003 off when measuring. I contact Mitutoyo for service and they gave me run around. They said o had to get with Amazon. So guess what happen when I contact Amazon? Yep, they sent me back to Mitutoyo. I felt like a yo-yo and MU caliper is still not fixed, lol. Shipping was fast though..."
5,Wonderful Children's Story,"This is the most whimsical, sweet story of a tiny clown named Tucky. Vivid and detailed illustrations. It brings so much joy to children who hear it."
1,Personal Glorifcation,"Ehrlich seems to be another guy who has an aganda and is trying to make himself popular, while having no REAL TRUE insight into what go's on in the CHabad Movment."
1,One of the most amateurishly produced videos ever made,"This is a very low budget, TOTALLY UNEDITED video of a synposium on Anceint Astronaut theory. There were MANY MINUTES where the video camera recorded NOTHING BUT A PODIUM. The producers spent absolutely no effort in the production value of the product. They have no business charging for this video. If the producers had hired some talented middle scoolers to edit it it would have been much better.If you want an exceptionally entertaining, mind blowing videos series on Ancient Astronaut Theory then I would reccomend the History Channel series, season 1 and 2."
5,This information needs to be circulated more,"The product arrived before it was supposed to and it was in better condition than the advert said it would be. This is good stuff, our population needs to hear this information because there are quite few out there that are still in the dark."
5,Ancient Astronauts,"Good lecture...provides several theories, and supplies data and examples in favor of the exosolar origins theory of life on our planet."
1,Ancient Astronauts - The Gods from Planet X,"If you are thinking of buying this DVD, don't. As with ""Our extra terrestrial Legacy"" DVD. It is a very amateur video of a stage speech, unedited for DVD. The speakers seem unprepared, visuals are childlike overhead projections, sound quality is very bad, often fading. Some of the information is interesting but nothing that someone who is truly interested in this subject does not already know. Very disappointing and a total waste of money !!! There are many more worthy DVD's on offer - such as the Ancient Alien Series 1, 2 & 3"
4,"A decent second choice, but the first choice is brilliant","Andre Previn made this nice recording of Britten's Spring Symphony in 1978, featuring excellent solo work, especially from tenor Robert Tear and mezzo Janet Baker (her singing of Auden's 'Out on the lawn I lie in bed' is the best thing here). Orchestra and chorus are fine, as is EMI's sound. But this CD runs up against one of Britten's most brilliant recordings, a version from 1960 that surpasses even the high standards set by this genius of a conductor. Britten communicates a sense of joy, revelry, and mystery that Previn can't touch.In addition, Peter Pears does some of the most superb singing to be heard from him, and all the other soloists are nearly as inspired. Despite its seemingly simple subject, the Spring Symphony's 12 disparate songs and lack of easy melody make it a tough work to bring off. I'd recommend going for a truly great recording, even though this one is a very good effort."
4,An overview of a great sideshow.,"This book provides one of the most comprehensive summaries of the Allies' actions against the German colonies in Africa. Although most historians of the period dismiss the actions in both the Pacific and Africa as sideshows to the great battles occuring in Europe, Byron Farwell's untiring effort at research gives the reader a fascinating view of battles, the leaders, the men that are on a par with the finest hours on the Western Front. A must read for any serious military history buff."
5,An untold story of World War 1,"Before I came across this book, I never saw very much written on World War 1 in Africa. This book gives us those missing chapters. It covers the fighting between The British,French, South Africans against the Germans. It covers the fighting in Togoland, Cameroon, German East Africa, and South West Africa. It also covers the colonial rebellion in Nysaland that the German and British both worked to surpress."
4,Praising Don and Seeking Help,"Let me agree with Henry Puccinelli who has raised his voice in praise of this great singer. However this is more of a plea for assistance. I have been trying in vein to obtain a track listing of this potentially great CD. If you Henry, or any other person who reads this, has this information please share it in the form of a review. Thanks."
1,I'm Yours by Don Corbell,"I bought this music specifically for the song ""Hold My Hand"". The rest of the CD is good, but the end of ""Hold My Hand"" is garbled. I am very disappointed in it."
2,not a good representation,I found this book not to be a very good reference resource. The drawings were very childlike. I've seen better in coloring books. Not a very good example of the entire Bible.
3,"good series, So-so book","I love the saddle club series, but this book was definitly not the best IT is goodcompared to some other author's books, thogh. Read the rest of the series they rock"
4,What nearly was...thank God is wasn't.,"Hitler - The Victory That Nearly Was by Bruce Quarrie is one of the first realistic World War Two What-ifs I ever had. The idea is that the invasion of Malta by the Germans would give them control of the Mediterranean and also allow them to win in Africa. After that things just go downhill for the Allies.The author also changes two more things - the invasion of Russia is pushed back and so is the attack against the US forces by the Japanese Imperial Army and Navy. This helps the Third Reich by allowing them more resources and men during the first chapters of the book.The author, besides vast knowledge of World War Two, uses wargames to test and retest many of the battles and actions. His knowledge of the men and equipment allow him to plot out their actions without sounding too much like fantasy. No time machines, no laser guns, no alien invasions."
5,A small corner of the earth made large.,"This book is a wonderful marriage of clear prose and stunning photographs. Few people know about the highest and most rugged corner of the Cascades, but Martin conveys its grandeur and beauty.I expected climbing stories and natural history, but a chapter on beatniks? It's a quirky book but it all hangs together. Worth it for the photography alone."
3,Can it works in a Acer Aspire 3620 Notebook?,"I want to know if this item need a specias PS Slot (EXPRESS), to work in a Acer Aspire 3620."
5,Wonderfully honest,"Both Kenny and Julia are very honest and open in the book about how their love impacted one another and how their relationship impacted the children. It was an eye opening, tremendous effort to keep truth in a relationship. It was disheartening to hear that they divorced; but they said all along that relationships don't always last forever. I'm glad I read it and I have to say I learned from them."
1,Kenny's gonna wake up some day from this craziness and ouch!,This was very painful to read. I felt sorry for Kenny's downword spiral and someone wanting to take advantage of him. I love Kenny's music. His song writing is superb. I own all his CD's; but the book is horrible. She made a fool out of him. Kenny found a woman who took advantage of his depression and need of therapy. Or maybe she was in the same boat. I suspect Julia wanted to make a statement to the world and at Kenny's expense of looking like an immature narcissistic fool. What an embarrassment to his kids and family! In the end I suspect the psychic will be proved right.
4,Unimaginable Life Book Review,"I am an avid Kenny Loggins fan and had heard about this publication and knew I had to have it. I found it a bit slow in parts and really not offering enough substance about Kenny and his career. I did not come away with a wealth of information that I had hoped would be in this book. It's definately not a bad read, if you like Kenny Loggins, but I found it to be a bit disappointing with the material presented."
4,Loved the book!,It was a great book. Loved the way that they were both brutally honest about their feelings. It look a lot of nerve to keep some of those entries in the book. It opened my eyes to the way a relationship can be.
1,OH PUH-LEEEEEEZ!,"I have always loved Kenny Loggins' music, so I bought the book, hoping to learn a little about one of my favorite musicians. Waaaay too much information. Are these two of the most self-absorbed whiners, or am I missing something? I found their ""passage"" to ""true love"" boring, trite, unenlightening and just plain nutty. Only in California! I'm disappointed to find that Kenny Loggins is the typical celebrity, too much time, money, and self indulgence. Blech, I'm still choking on the treacle."
2,"Unimaginable life, indeed","I bought this book a number of years ago. I'm a big Kenny Loggins music fan. I thought the book might offer some insight into developing relationships that work. He seemed to have found some way to make it work, although I have to admit to being a bit uncomfortable with Kenny's public pronouncements that he's found THE ANSWER. Now I just learned that he is divorced from Julia. Marriage is hard work, and I don't judge him for the failure of his marriage. But it may be a cautionary tale to the rest of us that we have to take advice from others about relationships with a grain of salt. Despite all of Kenny's song lyrics and prose about finding success in relationships, in the end he couldn't make it work forever either.That doesn't mean marriage can't succeed, but we might do better to study couples who have been together for a lot more years to get a glimpse into what works and what doesn't."
1,"OH, MY, GOD!","These people are so deluded and in love with the idea of their own ""preciousness"" that it could make the reader dry heave. I think this is an excruciating example of two people w/ complimentary sickness/neediness latching onto each other for dear life. Most couples in this condition keep it to themselves, but because Kenny is a celebrity (and Julia clearly *wants* to be one) they have written a tedious tome with blow-by-blow details of her willing martyrdom to the cause of becoming the 2nd Mrs. Loggins. After years of her relentless pursuit, Kenny becomes so worn down by her trite New Age pleas and manipulations to be ""totally, brutally, nakedly HONEST and to reach out for your True Soulmate,"" that he starts espousing this crap too -- at the peril of his sucessful career.....Now he can always look back on this embarassing book and, in retrospect, see how this pretentious woman played him like a violin. But then, he won't mind-- because ""Love is Never Wrong."" Gag."
2,Deceived,Product came promptly. Only problem is that it wasn't the product I thought I was buying. The picture they use looks like a 12-16 inch squeegee (which I thought I was buying since most honest companies tell you on the picture that the product shown isn't the product you are actually buying). Apparently this company believes you should read the fine print very carefully and they would be right. And I will next time to make sure that I never purchase from this company again.
1,sucks,doesn't work. sucks. out. loud. the psp would not read that this thing was even attached. seems like a good idea. waste of money.
5,Here is a book that every one (gay or straight) should read.,"Howard Brown M.D. was NYC's first health-services administrator. He faced great odds on coming *OUT* in 1973 as a public figure. His announcement, has he put it, ""ended my life of fear."" Through out the pages he tells of stories of small town America gay men, the task of 'Coming Out', and how there are more gay doctors, lawyers, and teachers than there are hairdressers. Brown's book tells of his own experiences and helps to reinforce the homosexual's self-esteem"
4,Works Well,"Wanted to add another stick of RAM to my aging pc.Pros:cheapworks fineCons:poor overclocking(I haven't been able to overclock this stick like i have my gskill (F2-8500CL5D-4GBPK) ram sticks, which overclocked very easily and have taken way more then i would have thought possible.I purchased this stick thinking my overclocking success was more due to my motherboard not the RAM.)"
1,My Working Mom.. IS AMAZING and the two dudes who concocted this book are chauvinists,"What an incredibly horrible message for children! My mother worked and was wonderful and she will always be my role model because of that. Shame on the author for putting additional pressure on working mothers. How on earth would this man understand the experience of a working mother? Also, he obviously never took into account that SOME WOMEN DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE AND NEED TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES. Not everyone can be, or wants to be, a stay at home mom. Where the hell is the ""My Work-a-holic Daddy"" book? This is a ridiculous piece of nonsense and I know because I wasted 3 minutes of my life reading it. The author should be ashamed of himself."
1,are you kidding me?,"HA! Wow. This book is REAL? I also checked to see if this was real after reading Tina Fey's book and I'm absolutely appalled. Please nobody ever buy this book, it's an insult to women."
1,Insulting,"I too am one of the moms who found this book courtesy of Tina Fey. I also believed it to be a joke but am not too surprised that is it not. How utterly offensive and down right misogynistic of the mom to be portrayed as a witch! I am not saying don't write about the real experience children have with working mommies, I know I am often short, absent and a myriad of other ways I am not the Norman Rockwell painting of motherhood but I am a real person who deeply loves her children, works because I have to but is fortunate to work at what I love and I don't need a working man to tell me that I am a witch for doing it. Shame on you privileged 1% white guy."
1,Amazon should be embarrassed to sell this book...,"This book is a sad commentary on working mothers. Being a working mother is the hardest job I will ever have, and until you do it every day you have no right to judge or comment. Amazon should be embarrassed to sell this book which insults, what I would guess to be one of thier largest customer groups... Working Mothers."
5,"You complain about the subject matter, yet....","...you're spending time in front of your computer, complaining about a book when you could instead BE SPENDING TIME WITH YOUR KIDS. no wonder you're being equated to witches. it's not like your 5-year-old is going to the nearest bookstore and paying for this book by himself/herself."
1,Horrible view of working moms,"Do not read this book to your child unless you want your child to think you are a witch for working. The male author's assumption is that women are fully responsible for parenting. And, if the mother enjoys a work, she is even a worse mom! How did this ever get published?"
1,Incredibly offensive.,"Yeah, everyone knows that having a working Mom is only slightly preferable to being an orphan.This book makes me so mad I'm actually having trouble stringing words together to express my outrage.So here's a blog post: [...]"
4,You think you got it bad?,"You don't know nuthin'! At least you're not rotting away in an dank, absolutely dark underground dungeon for more than a decade, half-starving and going mad, where your only pleasure is to not feel anything in particular, and the occasional bird song that one hears."
4,I'm Satisfied With This Cart,"This cylinder cart works okay. There are several minor problems that prevented a 5-star rating from me.I did make several improvements--which was a bit annoying--but overall I determined them to be far less work than either fabricating a cart from scratch or modifying a standard hand truck. The main improvement consisted of adding several 1/2"" washers to each side of the axle to shim out the wheels a bit; this eliminated the possibility of the cylinder bumping against a wheel. I also added a another strap--this one elastic--to better hold the cylinder in place.The size of the cart is appropriate to the task, and the single handle aids in maneuvering the cart. The bracket to hold the hot torch is very useful. I would purchase this again if I needed another cart."
1,Bad Quality Control - Too Expensive,Unit arrived with only one wheel in the box. Bottom platform was bent causing propane tank to be unstable. The supplied tie-down strap is almost useless. The wheels are too small and too close together for the unit to be used on any surface other than smooth concrete.Bottom line: Bad deal for the price they charge for this thing. Good idea poorly executed.
5,Red Dragon CD-100 Propane Cylinder Dolly,"This dolly was very easy to put together. Two bolts, attach the wheels(I used a socket over the end caps)and attach the strap...done! The bottle does not contact the wheels at all. I'm very happy with it."
5,Quality Product,The Utility Cart for the Weed Dragon gas cylinder is of excellent qualtiy and requires minimal assembly. Great Buy by Northern Tools.
2,Cylinder rolling cart,"Though I followed the instructions for putting the wheels on, the spread on the wheels is too narrow. When you put a 20 gallon propane tank on the cart the wheels rub and make it hard to pull the cart. Im trying to figure out a way to ""shim"" out the wheels on the shaft."
2,Good Idea / Bad Design,"The pull along cylinder cart is a great idea and is very convenient. It needs to be redesigned though. The full size cylinder moves around on the cart which causes the wheels to drag on the cylinder. I had to affix two small blocks of wood onto mine to create space for the cylinder to sit and the wheels to move freely.Overall, I do think it is a great idea. The prop on the back for the fire nozzle is a great design."
1,Not Very Impressed,Received the item in good time but the nylon strap was missing. Sent a message to Amazon but no reply!Purchased another strap from Home Depot and assembled the wheels as per instructions. With a 20 lb cylinder they won't turn.Not very impressive!
3,Not All Terrain,"This cart could better reflect the likely use of the equipment it is designed to carry.On the plus side it is sturdy and the propane bottle straps securely onto it.The following features render it difficult to use on moderately rough terrain:1. Single center handle: Makes it really hard to control the cart, which wants to roll over off of the wheels.2. Skinny little wheels: Inadequate to navigate on anything other than hard, smooth surfaces.3. Too narrow: The wheels are too close together, making the cart unstable.All in all it's OK, but sometimes aggravating to use. I wish they had welded a ring somewhere to keep the hose off of the ground as well."
1,Dolly for Propane Weed Torch,"I would not purchase this dolly a second time and do not recommend it. The wheels are so small that the dolly will only roll over sidewalks without a great deal of trouble. Also, it is so flimsy that the weight of the cylinder is almost to much for it. Couple that with an axle that is too narrow to allow installation of better wheels and you will come out ahead just getting a longer hose and dispensing with the dolly all together."
4,Good piece of equipment that's sufficient to the task.,"Well constructed, actually probably over engineered, which I like.Only complaint is the strap, while functional, is kind of wimpy, and could have been done better with minor effort."
4,Elephant of Parvati,"While the series is good it screams for more development near the end of each book. The author spends half of the book setting up the story, the next third on some plot, and then just wraps the book up like a half hour tv program that needs to be finished immediately. I was very disappointed to find several that the editor did not catch. The character Jonathan starts out 24 years old in the first two books, in the third book he is 22, and in the fourth book he is 21. Also, in the last book, Natasha Welles talks of making the finding of the talismen into a movie and tells of ""finding the mooncake of Chang-O in a hidden city in the volcano"". While this is true, the only two characters that know that information are Josh and Ollie, and they have been sworn to secrecy. While my school children have enjoyed the books, they were disappointed in the lack of consistancy within the books."
1,Boswell's book not the work of a credible scholar,"Boswell's work is a monumental work in the field of justification and eisigesis! Knowing that Boswell himself was gay, and died of AIDS will only enhace the reader's understanding of the book. If one is looking for justification of the gay lifestyle, this book is a great start. But if one is interested in studying homosexuality in the Christian Church, and interpretatioon of Scriptural reachings on homosexuality, this is not the place to be. Prooftexts abound, as Boswell brings his own agenda to inform the meaning of the history and of the Scriptures. In addition, Boswell's interpretation of relevant Scriptural passages is a very inaccurate treatment of the original languages."
3,Better than the first album,"I personally prefer this album compared to his first solo-release. It's sounds more like a band performance. It has one lost Doobies classic om it ""Baby take me in"". Recommended for Doobies-fans only, though.Why did Wounded Bird Records not release this album (33 minutes only) with ""Everything You've Heard Is True"" (29 minutes !) on 1 CD ?"
4,"It's the ""ghost"" of Wes Eisold...!!","Do not hesitate, hardcore and American Nightmare/Give Up The Ghost fans, to get this album right away. The hype surrounding this album was definitely justified. While not a carbon copy of the now defunct hardcore greats, the vocals sound somewhat like Wes and the music is total hardcore with a few innovations here and there, to keep it from getting stale. People who swear by hardcore music often praise the genre for it's unrelenting sound, and boast that innovation is mostly an afterthought and not that important. No one can deny, however, that some of the greatest (Gorilla Biscuits, Judge, GUTG) are undeniably distinct and innovative in their own way. This Is Hell are on their way."
3,"Poor Video Quality, But Entertaining...","Poor video quality, but nevertheless entertaining if you haven't seen this classic before. Although the special effects and particularly the mathematics of scale leave a lot to be desired nowadays, the movie somehow works. It kept me watching. I don't think the other review with only one star is fair. Okay, the picture quality isn't superb, but it makes up for it in many other ways."
2,The Borrowers.,"I was disppointed. I bought it for a gift. The colors were so muted-faded, not at all like I remember from the TV program years and years ago. Or is the copy old, old, old?? I didn't think a CD would loose the true color. Was fun to see again, but decided the British accent of the characters would not work for a gift for the special needs child. I love the story. We regularly blamed 'the borrowers' when our children were growing up!"
2,cute story - dubbing was horrible,I saw the movie as a child and remember loving it. It defintely is for younger kids. Unfortunately the DVD I received was a horrible copy. Very disappointed in quality.
3,Looks Great,"I have not yet used our new scale. It will be in the master bath of the new home that we are building. However, it arrived in a very timely manner and was packed very well. We are looking forward to using it."
1,The worst film ever...period!,"Sometimes a story can be so farfetched and uninvolving that it's not even funny. The characters here are EXTREMELY undeveloped that sometimes you start thinking this is a comedy or satire. It's with Nick Nolte being assigned a case by a prostitute and he goes from one oddball scene to another. All the stars, primarily Winger and Nolte, lack the kind of edge and downbeat charm that makes them so likeable in the first place. A real talkathon (only film ever that made me go to sleep). God it's awful!"
3,Questions people ask Catholics,"There was some good info in this book, but I have a couple others that have more info and I like them better. However, this is NOT a bad book."
2,Nothing Special,"I can't say I enjoyed this book. At the beginning, the hero and heroine were quite immature, but that was the point. However, ten years later I don't think they'd advanced all that far. The only thing that made their later relationship believable was the fact that they'd corresponded regularly over the course of ten years, and that correspondence meant a lot to each of them. However, when they were reunited after ten years, they didn't seem to know that much more about each other than when they'd parted. I thought the characters were entirely too modern in their attitudes and behavior, and I found it somewhat annoying. I couldn't really lose myself in this book, and to me that's the whole point of reading fiction."
5,"Great book, funny and sweet","this was another wonderful book by Geralyn Dawson, as always she writes with humor and wit. The two main carachters Sara and Nick are great. Instead of instead attraction, these two build a realtionship over ten years through letters. They know they care about each other but have obstecles in their way, not other people, or misunderstandings, but the decision on where to live, and other practical issues. Also a nice touch is how the aurthor includes characters from her other books in this one."
4,Lots of fun!,"I love Geralyn Dawson's works and this one is no exception! Lots of fun, love and adventure. I particularly like all the pranks pulled and couldn't help but laugh a lot while reading this. Happy endings always help too!"
3,Light Reading,"Easy read, started the series and want to finish them. Am curious to see who each sister winds up with."
2,"BORING, BORING, VERY IMMATURE","Sorry but I can't agree with the other writers. Yes, there were some funny parts; however, both Sara and Nick are immature, immature and dumb. You'll wait 10 years to consume a marriage? Come on. This is too ridiculous to contemplate."
1,BORING,I agree with another reviewer. This book was so boring and hard to get through. The only reason I kept reading was that I hoped it would get better. It did not.
3,A Decent Effort,"This book made me want to read more about the charaters involved... however that was also the weakness of it. It devoted too many page to people, places and events that didn't take place in these pages. The situations seemed a little contrived too, but for beach reading, it's okay."
4,"Great set, must watch, but poorly packed","I ordered these from Amazon a few months ago and it was only ~$90. Now it's $500+ Wow! Anyway, if they ever drop back down in price, I recommend this series to anyone. The only issue is the discs are all packed on top of each other on 1 spindle instead of separate slots. This is an easy fix by buying blank DVD cases. Although beware! The cases are NOT the standard 27mm and will not fit in the cardboard slipcase. You have to get the 22mm cases. I got mine cheap here: http://stores.casetopia.com/-strse-171/blu-dsh-ray-scanavo-double-disc/Detail.bok I ordered 1 6-disc (22mm) and 2 8-disc (22mm) for just a couple of dollars. (Season 1 only has 6 discs and season 2 and 3 have 8 each)."
4,awesome product! a must have!,"Awesome that they combined the whole series into one box set! Ordered it and got it a week before they predicted I'd get it, so shipping was fast! The only gripe I have is that the first series case has individual slots for each disc, but the other 2 seasons' discs are just stacked on top of each other. Other than that, nothing negative to say about this product. Would Definately recommend this to every Rurouni Kenshin fan!"
4,Fantasy212,"This anime is fantastic, I really love it, the boxes look really cool in the outside, it got home on time, but I was extremely disappointed when I opened it because Instead of finding the dvds each in its case they were all piled in a tower. I really love my anime collection, and piling Cds one over the other only gets them ruined, that is the reason I dont give it 5 stars"
4,great anime,"This is one of the best samurai Anime out there with endearing characters, cool battles and a great historical theme. How ever i will warn you that fights take for ever and the lead female is irritating i the worst kind of way."
5,Simply Awesome,Their are few shows that live up to their expectations from how I remembered them as a child. This is definitely a must have!
3,Russian Revolution,"I purchased this Item to aid me in a Russian history class I am taking. It has a somewhat limited perspective of the Russian Revolution, but it was helpful."
2,Not a Documentary,"This is a well done long editorial piece. As far as I am concerned, documentaries are to present all the facts and leave judgment up to the viewer. It does not matter that I agree with most of the opinions. They have no place in what I thought was a historical documentary. I can not recommend this DVD. And it should NEVER be used in a school and presented as a History of the Russian Revolution. It is a commentary on the Russian Revolution."
3,Magic Disapointment,"After many sessions on the game it worked well, then the game triggered a hum on the sound card and froze up. The only way out was to hit Ctrl/Alt/Delete and get out and start over. After this happened many time we gave up on the game.Great game but disappointed that it didn't work well later.I wish you could help me get a customer service rep from that company so I could explain it better.Thank you."
3,Good 101 introduction,"The interview is well laid out and informative, but if you are an old timer you may find this film a bit of a snooze."
5,God-inspired motivation!,"Truthful, spiritual and worth reading! This book gets back to the basics of properly raising a child."
4,Book Project,"I bought this for a school book project and man was it hard to read! Old english and now I wonder why everyone insists spelling is so important (I'm only kidding). I really enjoyed it though. Based on the other info I had, it cause me to completely re-format my report and add lots I didn't have. There are a lot of little details I wouldn'tve had and sometimes I really got into it. It really opened my eyes to the history of their expedition which is a big thing for me!"
4,George W,"This was a very funny stand up routine, in which Will Farrell imitates President Bush. I recommend this to anyone who appreciates Will's humor and Pres. Bush."
4,Very Funny,"This was a great DVD, very funny. Personally i love Will Farrell; However, there were some dull parts but for anyone with the least bit political knowledge, its worth buying."
4,"""Ask not what your country can do for you, but what have I done to your country!""","Depending on your tolerance for pain, mind numbing arrogance and stupidity, you might not want to see another minute of George Bush, but with Will Ferrell starring in this final hour as Bushy, you might change your mind.With all the pain and suffering we endured during Bush's 8 years, we deserve saying good bye with a smile. Enjoy!"
4,Flips and grips well,Overall quality of the tongs is great grips well and feels well built in the hands. The locking mechanism on the back is good but could be a bit tighter. Minus a point for being made in Taiwan/China. I thought I was buying a German product. Guess those don't exist much anymore. Other wise a great product.
1,Bad product description,Don't order unless you own an all region player. I saw previous posts about this issue and ordered anyway in hopes that the product description was correct. Product description was wrong. They are shipping region code 0 not code 1 as listed. Lesson I learned wasn't the kind of lesson I was hoping for.
2,too violent,"Banana Games, Volume 2The drawing was excellent, the sex scenes were interesting, HOWEVER the graphic violence was non-stop & way over the top. If you like LOTS of mindless violence with your sex - enjoy. If you were just looking for some interesting, different sex....you would have to skip large parts to miss the violence."
2,Yuck...,"Having read the first in this series, I had an idea of what to expect, but I bought it anyway.What a mistake.The first few pages, with an outrageously well-endowed woman getting it on with her shemale lover, are good, but once the violence kicks in, all I can say is...yuck.It seems the aforementioned couple got on the Mob's bad side and now have assassins hounding them, assassins that seem to favor being the subject of someone who makes the Marquis de Sade look like a boy scout. What little interest that had been building quickly dissipated when they showed up.When the next one comes out, I'm going to save my money."
2,Not very happy with these,"In the end I wish I would have gone with a simpler non hinged option. The riveted hinge for the handle creates a nice leaky gap the seems to create more of a mess than these are worth. I realize the design is meant to ease storage and allow these to fit in low height drawers, but these small rings are not really worth it if poring anything in less than think pancake batter."
2,Nonstick?,"Should have listened to the other reviews. The nonstick is bs, I greased, buttered, pammed, and tried everything I could think of, eggs always stick.They're slightly larger than they should be, to properly fit on an English muffin. Eggs fit fine on a McGriddle, when you use the same ring to make the pancake. >.<I wish it would conduct heat better so the sides would cook and you could flip it easy.The key to not having egg seep through the bottom is press down while you're pouring the egg in.Have it hot enough to solidify when it hits, and lastly, use some kind of oil to fill in the spaces between the surfaces to keep the seal."
4,Good Buy,Would have given 5 stars but giving 4 because the egg/pancakes stick to the ring. But overall this is ok and is a buy.
1,Non-stick or just black paint?,"The ""non-stick"" coating on these is horrible - it just looks and works like baked on black paint. Also egg gets in the seam where the handle is. We've used these twice with butter and cooking spray. It takes longer to clean them than cook the egg. We're throwing these away and getting better quality ones."
3,Too Small,"These are a bit small for egg sandwiches. I prefer the ones from the VermontCountryStore. There's are stainless steel and are 4-1/14"" across. The same size as a kiser role.... perfect."
1,Inferior Product,Pro: NoneCon:1. Egg sticks to ring even if cooking spray is used.2. Egg leaks out the bottom even in the flattest of my skillets. Just not heavy enough to hold the egg inside the ring.3. Not really round when the handle is raised. (Not really a big deal like 1 & 2.)Overall: Not worth the money. I have a set of the chrome rings that work very well when cooking oil is used.
1,Once or Twice,These rings are not durable at all. They work okay the first or second time but soon the coating will start flaking off and they will rust. They are very lightweight and the egg will ooze out and also stick in the crevice where the ring joins the handle. I would not recommend these at all.
4,great for pancakes...not for eggs,Great for pancakes (unless you have too thin mix) but useless for eggs! Eggs just goop and ooze through the bottom...irksome indeed! You MUST grease them VERY well or pancakes will stick like mad! I would say average at best.
2,didn't work as advertised,"don't use them as they didn't work as well as advertised, egg runs out of edges so nice round eggs for sandwiches don't happen."
5,they work,no complaints. wouldnt change a thing. i did learn from reading reviews to put ring in the hot pan to let it warm up which will help prevent the egg from seeping out. unknown about the durability at this time
2,Little Tikes Version Better - read why..,"I bought the little tikes version for my son and this one for my daughter. I like the little tikes better because both doors open, the horn works and it has the pretend key that makes noises. This one doesnt have all those features. My twins fight over the little tikes one while this one just sits there. So even the kids prefer little tikes."
3,Good Toy,It is a very nice toy and a functional material for durable good and easy to clean in addition to light my only comment is that it has no seat belt and my baby comes out the bottom and can be hit if you're not careful. When the arm should indicate how the best wheels. But in general is beautiful and my daughter loves it.
2,My opinion,"I purchased this jig to install long European bars for a high-end kitchen installation. For that project, where there is no room for error, the jig worked fine. It can be difficult to set up for smaller jobs as well as the plated do not move as freely as they could. In addition, they should install a holder for the allen wrench required to adjust the tool. It never fails, when you reach for it, you have to search for the allen wrench to adjust it. Honestly, I have not used this jig since I bought it. For most applications, a couple of reference marks on the side on an aluminum level will do the trick. When your done, a little rubbing alcohol removes the marks."
2,poor translation,"I would strongly recommend getting a higher quality, clearer translation. This version of the classic is near incomprehensible compared to the Penguin or Oxford versions."
3,caesar's commentaries,I am not learned in Latin but the translation did not flow in English. The tenses changed so suddenly and inappropriately that I suspect the translator of being too literal and the end result was difficult to read in English. It gave the impression of one step above a computer translation. I can't imagine Caesar and his scribes being so crude.I must read another edition before I have an opinion on the book-it was difficult and tedious to read. Maps would have been helpful.
4,Nice translation,"I liked the translation--it brought Caesar's style to life. It also seemed to me that the section completed by Caesar's associate was distinct in style, which again made Caesar's more vivid. Be warned, though, that there is absolutely no commentary, which for me was problematic, as it the work clearly has its propaganda elements, and it would be nice to know exactly how much of a stretch some representations are. But for those looking for a straight translation, it's a nice choice."
2,What's latin for boring??,"Caesar might have been a good general but he's a uniquely boring writer with leaden descriptions of intensely exciting campaigns. The other problem is that it's best to read Roman writers in the original Latin as that way the ""otherness"" of ancient Romans comes across better. Ergo taedet me istius libris. Dabit deus his quoque finem."
5,Awesome clock,This clock is absolutely beautiful. I bought it to put on our mantle and was a bit skeptical that a clock at this price point would be very nice. I read the other reviews and placed my order. The clock arrived the next day and upon unpacking I was completely amazed at how handsome it actually was. At a bit over 13 inches I was concerned it would look too small on our mantle but I was wrong. This clock is quite well made and the tone of the chimes is extremely impressive. I love the adjustable volume which allows you to hear the clock without it being annoying!! Seiko has mad a winner here! As I am writing this I hear it chiming downstairs!! Love it. Great product and great service Amazon!
2,Clock disapointed.,"It looks lovely and the chime sounds like the real thing. However, the clock can only be programmed to turn off the chime between 11 pm and 6 am. To manually turn the chime off requires removing the back of the clock and fiddling with small controls. So a warning to those considering purchasing a Seiko chiming clock - if you don't like being kept awake until late at night or woken early in the morning then think twice about purchasing this clock."
4,Power in Praise,I haven't started this one yet. I have another book that says to read this one first. So I will start in a few days. I am looking forward to it.
4,Pithy Thoughts,"This small book is arranged by chapters, each having an introduction and then supportive statements built around a theme reflecting community. It must be remembered that the author is a nun so the applications often are fairly specific to the religious life. The collected quotes, however, are marvelous, general, and not particular to the Christian faith but rather to the human spirit. We used the book as an adult study, assigning students to read, interpret, and identify with the materials."
5,The best you can get!,"To me, this is probably the best of Pokemon drawing books. What really surprised me was the book included Pokemon #151 (Mew)! This is definitely a good book for first time artists and experienced artists. Clearly shows how to draw the Pokemon and also clearly shows the instructions. If you draw (And/or like drawing Pokemon), it's definitely worth buying!"
3,Somewhat useful,"A collection of articles on China's reform. Some analyses are overdated, but others still have implication regarding future transformation. Assigned to my class when talking about 80s/90s ecopolitical transition in China."
5,Cruising Rules: Relationship at Sea,Roland S Barth is a very well written book about his sailing life and how he came up with some sailing rules. Maybe I had my funny button on but I found myself laughing hysterically. I wish Mr. Barth would write more books about sailing. I also read his Tales of the Intracostal Warerways which was another maritime treasure
3,"Well, you see.","Discovered through means unknown, I just know it was ages ago. (So hah! Discovered them before all of you! xP Yeah, not through a Warped Tour CD.) I was here when they had what's-his-name. They don't seem to retain the same sound as their previous album. It's rather depressing, but s'okay. I wouldn't say the album is bad, it shows improvement, but really.Before, they would just be ""pop"".Now, they're considered emo?'k. Emo-pop.Listen to it if you're looking for something different from the stuff they play on the radios. Srsly."
5,Good Cd,"After coming across Amber Pacific last week, I decided that I liked what I heard and went out and bought both their EP (Fading Days) and their debut album. I must say that when I first heard this album, I loved it. But after listening to it over and over and over...I love it even more than before. This album is filled with great lyrics and great vocals, each song has enough range in between them to make me happy too. Amber Pacific is climbing my list of favorite bands very quickly. They are now up there with Brand New, Taking Back Sunday, Anberlin, Halifax, and Anadivine.Go out and get this CD and you will most likely not be dissapointed, they are a great band that will only get better. I am looking forward to their next release.-Biz-"
3,"My least favorite of the three flavors, but still good.","Well, RAG's definition of ""rich"" and mine seem to differ a bit. Certainly they'er cheddar cheese flavor, but it's not particularly sharp cheddar. It's a rather mellow cheesiness actually. If you have never tried this product before, I recomment the Bar-B-Que or cool ranch flavors first. However, if I'm hungry enough I certainly wolf these down fast, and feel no guilt afterwards."
3,In the spirit of Airplane and Kentucky Fried Movie...,"If Kenticky Fried Movie and The Groove Tube are your idea of a purely unadulterated, raucous, hilarous good time the you'll love THE SEX O'CLOCK NEWS with its flamboyantly outrageous updates on the latest state of affairs in sexual fashions, practices and behaviors. There's something in this movie to offend absolutely everyone! Just under cult status, this comedy from the 80's has received the following reviews:""Wild and off the wall..."" Pravda""Totally gross..."" National Star""Outrageous, irreverant, insanely funny..."" N.Y. TibuneLong out of print, this one will most likely never see the light of DVD so grab a vhs copy if you can still find one!!"
4,Interesting; a Solid Read,"The idea of the last days of mankind sucked me into ordering this one. The pace of the story is steady and plots developments are not outlish. A solid story, which when finish, you won't find yourself wishing you could get the time back."
3,Kind of Cheap and Told the Wrong Story,"As far as mysteries go, this one was cheap. It's solved (is that a spoiler... I don't think so) due to some unbelievably relevant information that our protagonist uncovers at some point in the novel but NEVER discloses to the reader. Very cheap.Also, for anyone who has completed the novel, don't you think the story about the OTHER guy at the end of the book who gets ""marooned in time"" seemed 1000x more interesting than this story? I would LOVE to read about the last human being on the planet slowly going insane over thousands of years, thanks to a medical robot which keeps his body young and wont let him die, as he tries to nudge an entire species of bi-pedal water-monkeys toward civiliaztion through social engineering!!! I mean, how COOL does that sound!?!?!"
4,Almost a Masterpiece,"Far superior to the previous book in the sequence, this novel explores to more depth the possibilities of the bobble technology. Vinge succeeds in portraying a mysterious yet very realistic far-future environment. This hard SF novel is wrapped up in an intriguing detective-story plot, which adds a thrill to the book, although in retrospect its the relative weak spot of the book, that keeps it from getting my 5-star (I would have given it 4 and a half...). One good thing about Vinge is that he keeps his novel short and to the point, and does not smudge just to produce more books.Highly recommended for hard SF fans."
3,Good reading but suffers the comparison with great SF novels,"It's a good reading, but I regret there's no way of rating 3.5. I hesitated between 3 and 4. I've been an avid SF fan for mor ethan 45 years. My rating took into condideration comparing this one with other books by other authors which I've read and that I found much more stimulating, intriguing or interesting, to name a few : Man in the high castle by Philip Dick, Left hand of darkness by Ursula Le Guin, Some novels of the Culture series, specially Look to Winward by Iain M Banks, Isle of the Dead by R. Zelazny, The world inside by R. Silverberg, etc. All in all, I found it a bit better than average but not brilliant."
4,"Good, but not the best by Vinge","This was a very good book, but not Vernor Vinge's best in my opinion. I felt that the way in which he introduced the characters could have been better. (I don't have anything against the 'give a character's backstory part way into the book, mind you, but it just didn't seem to flow well here.)The rest of the book - the plot, the development, even the twists, were all very well done."
4,Vinge blends genres and creates another fantastic sci-fi novel,"If you're a fan of Vinge's inventive sci-fi+ space opera works, you'll definitely not want to miss MIR. It's grander in scope than 'Peace War' and filled with much more realistic characters, especially the Hi-tech ones. The Singularity is conveniently left unexplained, and I hope Vinge addresses it in another novel.(Charles Stross' 'Accelerando' seems almost like a companion piece to this novel). MIR takes all the drama and formal set-pieces of a classic murder mystery and places it in a possible future set on a post-singular Earth."
5,Works in many different ways,"Imagine bouncing forward through time, for millennium, in ""bobbles"" and the implications. For the mystery fan, there is a murder spanning millennium. For the technologist, there are implications of accelerating technologies, of maintaining personal databases and records through millennium. Vinge's computer science teaching shines through without stifling his imagination. Embedded systems with Intelligence Amplification (as opposed to AI) are explored, as well as wearable (err ..brain-networked) computers. For the historian, there are those groping with the singular change and loss of humanity, and the manner of people dealing with being marooned for millennium (see Albert Camus - the Myth of Sisyphus).For all this is a great story. There are a lot of fun tidbits thrown in, like; ""dragon"" birds, who are evolving to set fires to get more to eat, people witnessing plate technonics, and interglobal network hacking (recall this was written before the internet!)."
5,Awesome book!!,"A truly great science fiction book in the tradition of the Masters..Vinge created a scientific concept and built a ""whatif"" story around it. It's even better since he made it a detective story.I love this book."
3,Runs small,"My 9 year old wore this for Halloween , and I wish I would have gotten the adult size! It fit ok, but hair either stuck out around nape of neck or forehead."
4,ok,these figures are alright the only flaw is that they are alot taller than the average wrestling figure
1,Of little use at best.,"As aforementioned, the mech and weapons stats are already in the game manual and in the game. So nothing new there. The supposedly ""detailed"" mech descriptions and evaluations really don't tell ya anything you didn't already know.. Ie going toe-to-toe with a big mech in a little mech isn't smart, or that one particular mech which is nothing but missle racks should be used for standoff missle combat--""gasp"" how scandalous. The single player mission walkthroughs are a joke, though they are helpful in warning you that entering area x is going to trigger hordes of scripted enemys to descend on you. As for the books advice on how to beat those hordes...well, most of it is idiotic at best.Basically, if you are desperate need of someone else to provide common sense while you play this game then this book is for you. For the other 99% of the ppl who buy this game its totally redundant."
2,Of no value to online players.,"I bought this book looking for tips and hints for the online multiplayer battles, having already finished the regular game a couple of times.It really offers nothing in terms of strategy that anybody with basic gaming experience wouldn't already know.The specs that it offers are already in the manuals and on the web, so no real value there. A large part of the book talks about each mech, but says little of importantance. Most of the information is already in the manual or in the game itself except for some minor editorials on recomended loadout changes."
4,excellent strategy for a flawed game,"As usual Sybex has put out a fine game guide.If only the game lived up to it's potential.I was disappointed the unrealistic graphics after playing mech 3 which was to my eyes on a great path towards that goal. Mech 4 is a step backward.With this guide you can't lose a mission,but that may be because the game is too easy.What do you think?"
4,Pretty Cool Book,"This book offered many unique designs that i have not seen before. It has 15 money folds and a section on envelopes and boxes. This book will tend to be hard for the beginner. I have done a few money folds and some of the pictures of the directions are hard to figure out whats going on. The pictures just need more detail. There is a lot of cool things in this book though, i really enjoy it!"
3,Fun - But not for Beginners,"I really like all the designs that are included in the book. Out of the 15 different designs I managed to only figure out how to do 5 of the designs. Some of the instructions and illustrations were not very clear in my point of view. I really love all the flower designs, but I was only able to figure out two out of the three. Of course, it was the most beautiful design that I was not able to figure out. Although, I was more experienced with origami folding than my husband, I had to asked him to try to analyzed the instructions since he is a physicist and a mathematician. He managed to help me figure out two of five designs that I was able to create. This book needs a bit more clearer instructions and should use more color to help with the illustrations. Think very hard before buying this book because you might not get all your money's worth if you can only learn how to create very few designs from it."
4,Great Book!,"This book has lots of different items you can fold, MUCH more variety than some other books. You can make some really cute things. Some of the same folds are in American Money folds too. If I had to choose just one money-folding book, I would choose this one.This is not a beginner's book! You need to have experience with Origami and be able to understand some pretty complex diagrams. I've done origami for ages and some of these have taken a time or two to figure out."
2,"some good designs, but very frustrating","this book frustrated me almost to tears. i tried some of the folds over and over again and simply could not get it. her names for the folds, color coded, dot/dashed lines for folds, etc. did not instruct me, but only succeeded in killing any enthusiasm i had when i purchased the book. some very nice designs, but not worth the suffering of trying to figure out how to make them."
2,Hard to follow,"I took a chance on this book after reading the reviews. I wanted to make a Gecko for my mentally disabled nephew because he loves GEICO and was going to have his 6 wisdom teeth pulled. I thought it might cheer him up. Well, I couldn't figure it out past step 10. If the pictures were real photos of the steps it probably would have been something I could have done. He is having surgery this very minute but he will find no Gecko in his get well pkg. :-{ I posted an email asking for help thru Amazon but no answer. I called the publisher twice. No help except an offer to pass my phone number to the author of the book. Never heard anything. (I had explained to the publisher why I was wanting to make the Gecko.) Oh, well. If one can't conceptualize, this book is not usable. I haven't tried any other designs, but I had bought the book specifically for the Gecko."

5,A Must Read for Everyone Affected by Breast Cancer,"As a metastatic breast cancer patient, I found this book to be enormously enlightening. For the first time, I feel as though I really understand this disease and how we've gotten to this point in time in terms of prevailing attitudes, available treatments, doctor-patient relationships, and overall prognosis. Although it's a history lesson, this book has also served to give me a new perspective for evaluating my own personal options. I feel empowered by the information in these pages. It points out how deadly serious breast cancer is, even though some would have us believe otherwise. I recommend this book for everyone who is affected by breast cancer (which should be practically everyone)."
2,Historical inaccuracies,"I can't review the work as a whole, not having read it. But I viewed one page and I found two definite factual errors and one possible error. Justinian, Emperor of Byzantium, was never married to Euphemia. She was the wife of Justin I, Justinian's uncle. Justinian did not marry Theodora the very next day after Euphemia died. First he had to convince his uncle to change the law forbidding people of high estate to marry ex-actresses. (Justin did change it.) Then Justinian became ill. Only after he recovered, did he marry Theodora. It is not certain that Theodora died of breast cancer. It may have been throat cancer. I was interested in this book, but if it includes such historical inaccuracies on a single page, how can one trust the author on other matters?"
2,Very disappointing,"This book contains no illustrations and little discussion to explain what Goddard invented and how those inventions worked; so it's not clear what Goddard did or why he should be famous. Instead, author Clary's book is a tedious account of Goddard's squabbles over priority of invention, of his constant pursuit of funds for his research, and of his widow's efforts to secure his patents and to promote his place in history. Dull and plodding.This book was apparently intended merely as a corrective to the standard biography of Goddard; namely, Lehman's ""This High Man."" If you want to understand Goddard's work on rockets, look elsewhere."
1,Fell apart within 2 weeks!,I bought my husband this gas grill cover for a Christmas gift (Go Trojans!). We then had several weeks of heavy rains and the grill cover first came apart at the bottom and then on a seam. Don't waste your money on this product. The vinyl cover is flimsy and the stitching does not hold up. I live in a temperate climate (San Francisco Bay Area)and if this cover can't take the elements here...
1,Not Impressed,"I really didn't think that this was anything special. I had hoped for an Alanis, Sarah, pop mainstream kind of thing, and this wasn't it. Not bad, but not great."
2,"Over produced, a little disappointed","After reading the other reviews in here, I thought I was in for a real thrill ride. But unfortunately, I was a little disappointed. I'm no music expert, but I know a little bit about music, and it seemed like everything was fake instruments. I mean the sounds were very ""unreal"". I would be very interested to see this woman live (if I didn't have to pay to see her) and see if it is just a bunch of pre-recorded noises and stuff or if there is a band really playing or what. Nice voice for the most part. I guess overall it was ok, just not really my speed."
3,Just what I needed,"I needed this book for one of my classes, and it got me through just fine. It was a different version than what was in the campus bookstore, so I was never on the same page as anyone else, but it was so much cheaper."
1,Unacceptable,"Book not as advertised. Threw it in trash. Dirty, crinkled cover, book filled with highlighted and underscored passages, comments jotted in margins, earmarked pages, and something I would not even consider selling at any price. ""Your Online Bookstore"" will never get any more business from me."
5,Necessary Roughness,My husband is a die hard fan of this movie. At any given time he is watching this. He loves it.
2,Too small,My son can fit this whole thing in his mouth. It's too small for my boys to play with. I wouldn't get this product again.
1,"Love the idea, but can't hold weight for a two and four year old","I purchased this wagon and the kids loved it, I loved the parent cup holder on top and the top itself to shade from the sun/rain. My kids are only 29 and 35 pounds - just turning two and 4, and the front wheels splay out with the weight - with my little one in front - he just turned two today 5/23. It is suppose to hold up to 150 lbs, but I'm going to have to take it back. It is hard to pull, as they wheels lean in when you are moving. The wheels themselves are sturdy, but the heavy plastic material the wagon is made for gives a bit, just enough to make the wheels out of alignment."
1,"wanted it to work, but didn't","Do not purchase!! It is defective. The front wheels either bow out or in depending on the weight. I tried two of them and the floor model at the store, all did the same thing. My two children have a combined weight of 60 lbs and the limit is 130 lbs, so it shouldn't be a problem. The store knew of this problem, as well as this web site, but when I called Step 2 they said they were unaware. So save yourself the headache of putting it together and returning it, move on to something else. And it's a shame becasue I really liked the fact it had a roof."
1,If this is what you are in to...,"This book is only for those interested in organized, family- oriented, recreational naturism in campgrounds and resorts around the U.S. If you are looking for any information on beaches or other areas to go naked, this is NOT the book for you! What little information about nude beaches that is included is woefully inadequate, so don't be fooled by the cover!"
2,Need more info,Not really detailed enough to help -- several web sights that give you this much or more info on these places -- and they are FREE -- but if you want something to travel with (as I did) -- then by all means -- take it along -- just call ahead to be sure things have not changed too much --a member of AANR
1,A very poor guide!,The name is VERY misleading. There is very little in it about Canada and only those resorts that are AANR members get listings. There are no nude beaches listed. Should be called The AANR Club Guide. A waste of money.
4,Great Mystery book for those interested in Lithuania,"""No Salutes for Surrender"" is a great mystery novel. Allowing for the small mistakes of a young and new writer the book was excellent. It was particulary interesting to those of us who have visited the area Antanas talks about. My Lithuanian friends were particularly interested in the book also.Congratulations to Anatanas for a fine peice of work."
2,Unstable,"The problem with this easel is that there is no way to lock the legs into place, so the easel is highly unstable. Maybe the legs will stay put on plush carpet, but who paints on that? On hardwood or tile floors the legs scoot out and flop flat. Tightening the wingnuts makes only a temporary difference; even the slightest pressure on the table causes the legs to collapse. I gave this product two stars (instead of 1, which it actually deserves) only because I like its general appearance and wood construction."
4,Pleasant theme,"What you've got here is a stirring John Williams theme... before John Williams.I only say this to compare Rosenman's theme to such a great composer because, well, the East of Edem theme is great. It's very stirring and ahead of its time. The rest of the score isn't as stirring but it is still very nice, especially for a film from the 1950's.Definitely worth the buy."
5,Quality For less,Excellent Rangefinder for golf. Distances are right on. It's a little hard to hold steady when aiming at the flag but you'll get used to it.
3,range finder,Not to happy with product wanted it for golf to find the distance to the flag stick but this range finder can not pick out the stick and always picks up a bigger object behind the flag.the only way it works is if there are people on the green and then i can scope the person on the green and get my yardage.I would not have gotten it if i knew this would happen
1,Definitely NOT FOR GOLF,"This was on Dick's golf website. It's fine for large objects, but even at 50 feet it is extremely difficult to get a reading on a pin or flag. Too bad we didn't read the reviews first.And as it was a Christmas gift in a northern climate, we didn't have a chance to test it until we went to Florida in late January when we immediately realized it would not work for golf. By then it was beyond Dick's 30-day return period and, even though we explained the delay in our using it, they would not take it back for an exchange on another brand or model."
2,Not for golf,"Seems like a nice enough unit. Compact in size, works great playing around in the backyard sighting relatively large objects. But once you get it on the golf course it's worthless for spotting pins (and my course has reflectors). I bought it based on the store person saying the golf and hunting technologies were identical, but in my experience this unit can't be used for golf.For what it's worth I did find it hard to stabilize the crosshairs. It's not impossible to use but I could see someone who bought it for hunting being discouraged w/difficulty locking in on a target."
1,very poor,the entire top railing peice came off when my two 20 month old babies leaned to the same side at one time and they both flipped upside down (seat bealted in) onto the concreteNot recommened the railing needs to be more secure to the wagon
2,"Still stylish, but has not aged well.","You may have seen the original English-language broadcasts in the 1960's. The catchy theme tune will no doubt stir memories, but the dubbed dialog today seems unbelievably creaky, done with little regard for the nuances of character and story; the bad guys, for example, seem to be given alternately the accents of Nazis or Chicago gangsters. What's amusing now is to pick out the few obvious Japanese references in the video: women occasionally (and inexplicably) appearing in kimono, Japanese writing on instrument panels and packets of sweets ('Glico'), etc. Visually, it can still be very stylish."
4,Thompson WaterSeal Wood Protector with tinted color,"I used this stain/wood preserver on a wooden fence several years ago. It still looks very good several years later after severe winters and hot wet summmers. I have found it difficult to find this product in the stores (Lowes, Home Depot, Wal-mart, etc.} so I am happy to find it on Amazon. I would definetly recommend this product."
2,The Exciting Sounds of Model Road Racing,The cover art is cool. There are a couple small blurps with slot car noise but these are not in the music. The music is related in NO way to slot cars. This album is deceptively advertised. There are NO songs with slot car lyrics and it is not a recording of a slot car race. The music included is sort of Beach Boys / beatnick sound with no lyrics. Don't waste your money on this garbage.
5,Written by an expert,This book puts you in WWII aviation. It takes you throught flight training and into combat in the Mustang. I am a current flight instructor and believe me this book is realistic as it gets. If you love aviation you will love Bob Goebel's book.
4,Mustange Ace: Memoirs of a P-51 Fighter Pilot,Book was not long and drawn out. It was very interesting and gave a very good perspective of the life of a WWII Fighter Pilot. I enjoyed it very much.
3,Mustang Ace,"It seemed to me to be a very true account of how it was back then, and I liked the way he wrote his account.Rinty"
5,A most well written narrative of Goebel's experiences!,"Bob Goebel relates his experiences clearly and succinctly, and those experiences are most interesting to the WWII flying buff. He even makes his days before combat flying interesting and informative. His narration of combat flying is thrilling and and suspenseful!! In short, this is a great book. Joe Noah, author of Wings God Gave My Soul, biography of George Preddy."
2,Tour of duty,"I had originally ordered this as a new series. When I got it as used, I would still have kept it but it was in bad condition. I have never had a problem before with used CDs."
4,Tour of Duty,"I have really enjoyed re-living this wonderful TV series and now with the time to fully appreciate what it was all about. As with previous reviews, I did miss the original music score, but after the first few episodes it was easy to forget that it wasn't there. That would be the only negative feedback that I have. I am very pleased to have this to add to my collection and will be introducing it to my children who have no idea what happened in the Vietnam war. Oh and the packaging was superb."
4,Back to Vietnam,"Didn't miss an episode when Tour on Duty was on TV and it's great to have the complete series on DVD. A really good story with nice characters and a mix of war scenes, humour and romance. Since it's pure fiction it doesnt get as good as Band of Brothers, but it's definetely is worth buying if you like war movies."
3,"Hollywood, Watered Down, but still kind of fun.","I'm sure modern warriors can find lots of entertainment value in identifying the numerous technical errors being constantly made by the actors of the series. This is Hollywood style war, after all.When my older son was a little kid, he ate this series up, much the way I ate up ""COMBAT"" when I was a little kid. Both of us ended up in the Navy- go figure.My only real complaint about the package is that they changed the opening song from the Stone's ""Paint it Black"" to some lame action/new age creation that they must have commissioned to avoid royalty issues. The opening credits used to set the stage for the rest of the show, and now it's like, ""Huh?"""
3,Not the same without the soundtrack,"I rented the first season because I heard the soundtrack was missing and wanted to be sure I could still enjoy it before buying it for good. There isn't anyway I could buy this set.I loved the show when it was originally on but without the soundtrack it isn't the same. Someone said that if they wanted to hear the music they would just play the theme song of ""Paint It Black"" and other 70's songs off their CD player. That was the dumbest thing anyone could suggest. That would be like Star Wars not including the soundtrack on their DVD and then someone suggesting that you could just play the CD soundtrack while watching the movie.The original music helped set the background and feeling for the show. The music they have now just doesn't do it for me. It's a shame because this is one DVD set I would love to own."
1,No original music,"Where did the music go, that was the best part? Manufactures were too cheap, so you should be to cheap to buy their dvd with a crappy remix. I'm sure there are pirated copies that are much better."
1,"almost ordered the entire series,","BUT, after reading the harsh review about the original music having been stripped, I will have to do without. Why not watch The Godfather with music by Lawrence Welk.!If the series is ever restored as it was aired, I'll buy it,but not until then. A wonderful series, ruined by whoever stole the music."
2,a shame why remove the music with this junk?,very bad .... good show but without the soundtrack a wast of moneyjust wait one day it will be released with the original soundtrack .....dont understand why they removed the soundtrack in the first place
4,"Brilliant series, very intense to watch",I bought the whole series because it isn't available in the Benelux and it was worth every penny ! I watched season 1 and 2 now and i must say it's a very intense series and they have tried to let the people see that it wasn't all just shoot-em-up and wee we won.I would recommend this series (box) to everyone who knows about the series and who like action-drama series.
3,Mixed feelings,"I have been waiting for this product for years tocome out on DVD. The quality is perfect, but the music score which made this series a classic has been replaced by some bad copies."
2,"music, music, music","Sony is not listening. I would gladly pay double for the original series with original soundtrack. Sony, get with it!"
2,INCREDIBLE RIPP-OFF!!,"I was not only astonished after buying the full series on DVD that the MUSIC that made this series famous was COMPLETELY edited and replaced with generic garbage music, but angered and shocked into DISBELIEF that the POWERS that be would release this series in this manner. THE MUSIC was what this series was ALL ABOUT!!! Outrageous and unforgivable!!! A TOTAL rip-off because the true original flavor of the series has been totally comprimised and left IMPOTENT by this inexplicable oversight...I cannot stress enough the fact that if you can find even VHS tapes recorded during the original run of this series- no matter WHAT the picture quality is(luckily I DID record quite a few) are FAR superior to the meaningless TRASH they have put out for the public on this new DVD release..TERRIBLE to the NTH POWER!!!"
2,Needs The Soundtrack,This is disappointing that the soundtrack has been stripped from the TV series. I totally agree that the original soundtrack gave the mood for the show and without it loses it impact.
5,loved the TV show and so glad to have it on DVD now!!!,My husband and I are totally enjoying watching this TV series. Great quality DVD. Really cool box it is stored in.
5,Great!,"It arrived when they said it would arrive, and it was packaged very secure - no damage!! My dad is going to love it for his birthday!"
1,Worthless without the music,"Sony has been petitioned to allow the release of the DVD's as they were originally aired and the Internet is agog with folks trying to find this outstanding television series with the original music. Don't bother with this set, let Sony enjoy it sitting in their warehouses unsold."
4,Great Ideas for a Planted Aqurium,"This book is ideal for someone who wants some ideas about aquascaping, plant layout, plant selection and different planted regions of the world. I'm no plant expert, so while the information may not be accurate scientifically, it is certainly accessible to the average fish hobbyist.....Which is exactly what I wanted. If you want detailed information about which plants are compatible with fishes in nature, this book is not for you. This is not a book about fish. I was thrilled with the dated design and kitsch copy-write. There is definitely a Japanese influence here.I recommend this book if you are after some great pictures, and some ideas for a beautiful planted tank. Check out the mangrove tank and the African riverbank!"
5,Nice mouse matt,I was shocked with I got this in the mail. I have never had a mouse pad this big before. It works great for my Cyber Snipa mouse.
5,Gem of a movie...,"I have a foreign release of this film under its French title Ouis, Mais...It's known as ""Therapie"" (Therapy) in some other countries. This is a wonderful little gem of a movie--the best movie I've seen about therapy. Emilie Dequenne is great. I'd love to see her come to Hollywood and make U.S. films. I actually picked up the movie because she's in it, and I liked her so much in Rosetta and Brotherhood of the Wolf. The film is about a therapist who tries to help her deal with her family/relationship problems. It really rings true--especially the mind games her mother plays with her. Just a charming, fun film. Don't miss it!"
3,No completely satisfied,Product was received on time and very good protected but I was prefered the letter printed on deep groove as original not only letters ink over knob.
3,"Mostly good, but some bad pieces","Most of the container was very good and nice and peppery, but about 1/4 of the pieces did not have much flavor and were very stringy and gross. Considering the price I was expecting a higher quality product."
1,bad jerky,"Would not buy this again, I think my shoe would be more tender than this stuff, and almost no taste. I do not at all recommend this."
1,Bad Jerky!,"If you like hard grizzel running throught the entire strip of basically every piece in the jar then this jerky is for you. Total crap, very disappointing. Flavor was mediocre at best - overall terrrible cuts of beef. I will never purchase this product again. it's garbage. I wouldn't feed it to my Jack Russell. You would be wiser to stick with Pawnee Bill's beef jerky."
1,piece of junk,"This thing is a total piece of junk. It's folded metal, not cast, which is not too surprising since most of the cheapo junk these days is folded. The geometry is bad, it's hard to install such that it latches positively but also has enough clearance to swing open without running into itself. The spring and knob are loose and flimsy."
2,Not Wild about this Affair,I was very disappointed with the storyline of this book. The character Lianne who is a worst women's best friend. Finds herself attracted to her best friend boyfriend and ends up sleeping with him. By the way who is a cad himself. Then the mother of this clan decides to announce to her husband that when she first married him it was for his money & name. Then has the audacity to wonder why husband walk out. It is hard to like a novel when can't even sympathize or better still like the characters.
5,Great Experience,"I was so happy to find this, my kids love this cartoon. Product was just as advertised. Fast response and delivery. Had no issues at all and would purchase from them again."
1,Great show - Bad copy,"Though my daughter (and admittedly myself) thoroughly enjoy Chowder, this particular copy came in the mail scratched to the point that I cannot play the last two episodes on any of the multiple DVD players I've tried. If I had paid a penny plus s&h; this might not be a big deal, but I paid $5 before tax and other charges, ofcourse putting close to $10 which is about what it would cost used without having to wait for it to come in the mail. The condition was listed as merely 'acceptable' rather than 'fair' or 'like new' etc. but I believe even that is quite a stretch for a show that only plays 4/5ths of the way through. In the future I will go out of may way to avoid ordering anything from ""Centcolorado"".-Jamey"
5,IOld Series,I love these old TV series and am sad that I Spy only had three seasons. I liked it then and I like it even better now. They just don't make 'em like that anymore.
5,There should have been more...,...seasons than just three. Cosby and Culp were the perfect off beat pair in this series. Highly recommended
5,When Spies were Cool,"The last season of one of the best action/adventure series ever to air on network tv. Extensive location photography and new music with each episode (something unheard of in tv) and the incredible chemistry between Robert Culp and Bill Cosby. This same year would see the cancellation of THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. and the next year would see the demise of THE WILD, WILD WEST. The spy craze triggered by James Bond was winding down. Sean Connery had departed the role a year earlier. I am heartened to see this wonderful series available -- very affordable on dvd. A pity there is no commentary or interviews beyond the few with Culp. It would have been interesting to see them both reflect on this classic show. This last season has the one episode that has always stuck in my memory of the show: ""Home to Judgment"". This was probably the best single episode of the series."
5,Great book for sons,"This book is a charming way to tell your son you love him without being mushy or hovering :) He will appreciate it. It's not easy to find a 'card' or small gift for a grown or nearly grown son that lets him know how much his mother cares in language that is straightforward rather than melodramatic. It's a great remembrance to send to a son who is away from home or who isn't very good at listening to mom even from across the room. Or maybe mom isn't all that great at saying what she really wants to say.I was so pleased with this little book, I bought other versions for other important people in my life."
3,Good but could've been written better,"I don't see why some of the viewers gave this book 1 star and while it's a good book, I felt that it could've been written better and some parts of the book is interesting and I do have Aerosmith's Walk This Way and this was the book that got me interested in Cyrinda Foxe, the routine with Elissa and the airline stewardesses was funny, overall if you like Aerosmith: Walk This Way or Rebel Heart then you'll like Dream On: Livin' on the Edge with Steven Tyler."
4,Wild Child Who Walked on the Wild Side!,"I read this book and I felt for cyrinda. Its amazing that I read this book (feeling compelled to write to her) and found out she had died the day before. To be honest, none of us know Steven Tyler and how he really is. We don't know if all she says in this book is even true. Still as soon as I recieved it in the mail, I read it all the way through. I could not put it down. I was dumbfounded by the kind of lifestyle this runaway girl lived.She was brave but careless with her life. It's a sad sad story and I cried. I imagined living her life and it made my heart grow heavy. Maybe people don't agree with her book but its how she seen it. It's her personal life and she aired it and now shes gone. Get the book! Enjoy it! Its a roller coaster let me tell ya. But please keep and open mind because some things are really far out! But hey were talking about the ex wife of a toxic twin, what did ya expect!"
3,The Review of Dream On,"Being the loyal Aerosmith fan that I am, I didnt want to put any money into trashing of the band. So as soon as I found out that Cyrinda died, I figured that I should go ahead and buy the book out of pure curiosity, since the author could no longer recieve payment for people who bought it. I think she dramatizes a little too much and it seems that she is a little contradictory. She will say how she cares about Steven and such but on the other hand she will talk about every little negative that he has. Its an allright book, but I think she needed to tone down on the dramatizing."
1,bitter ex wife tell all,"I am a huge Aerosmith fan and wanted to read the book out of curiousity. I have never read such trash and negativity about a person. I can understand why Steven Tyler tried to stop the publishing of this book - it does nothing but make him out to be a raving, wife-beating, lunatic on drugs and I think it was very unfair to him. Sounds like a bitter ex wife that was trying to find a way to get revenge on her failed marriage. She should get a job with the National Enquirer!"
3,Don't let one book change your opinions about Aerosmith,"I did not read this book. I did read ""Walk this way"" that book was by the ""Boys"" I did notice that Cyrinda was not quoted at all in the book. Some of the other memeber's ex's were. To say that my opinion of Steven Tyler dropped would be wrong. I am amazed that the man lived to tell about all of his earlier days. Most of which I do not think he remembers clearly. Cyrinda left her husband for Steven. Steven had just ended a 3 year relationship. Before you judge by only what an ex-wife says, read WALK THIS WAY.I do plan on reading the book Cyrinda wrote out of curiousity. I do not feel it will change my views on AEROSMITH. They are awesome."
4,Marinate Octopus,"I grew up eating octopus, both fresh and canned. Finding it is difficult to impossible in Minnesota. I enjoyed this product although I wish Amazon had the one marinated in its own ink. Certainly an acquired taste, but one that seafood lovers should try. You can try it in an omelet with vegetables and topped with sour cream and marjoram or for a very fast meal, add to leftover rice, along with other sea foods, vegetables and a bit of liquid-a lazy person's Paella."
2,Marinade sauce is obnoxious,"I would suggest getting the kind in plain oil or completely draining them prior to cooking or eating. I threw it in marinade and all into the dish I was making. I could barely get it down. When I drained the cann and rinsed it, it was decent. The marinade sauce was obnoxious tasting. Also if grains of sand are going to bother you stay away form this product.."
4,Yummy Octopus,"I most like octopus in a hot sauce, but this product is less expensive than that already in hot sauce, so I just add my homemade hot sauce to this product and munch down."
3,Marinade not good enough. Not recommended as is.,"On my personal scale of 0(worst) to 5 (best), I have tasted this octopus and rated it as follows IMHO: presentation-visual appeal 3/5; Odor 2/5; Quantity of meat/fullness in can 3/5; Taste 3/5 and Texture 5/5.I'd rather recommend the Vigo marinated mussels (not the octopus) as they are much superior taste-wise with rice. I kind of agree with the 'ammonia taste' comment of another reviewer regarding the Vigo marinated Octopus, unfortunately. More wine/vinegar in the octopus marinade would have been needed.ADDENDUM January 2012:Suggested recipe: marinate drained content in balsamic vinegar and lemon juice: delicious! Ammonia taste vanishes and makes this octopus a luxury treat for connoisseurs!"
2,Tastes of ammonia - a sign of rotten seafood,Picked up a case of this to see how it compares to the Goya brand octopus I can get locally. It doesn't! It tastes of ammonia - as if the cannery stuffed rotting octopus in here. The only other time I've tasted ammonia in seafood was when I was in a cheap seafood buffet in a Biloxi casino.
1,They should pay you...,"The essential weakness of this documentary is it's overall low quality. The sound is mediocre, and the narrator sounds more like she's advertising a product on an infomercial rather than narrating a serious biography about an American president. Despite the 60 minute running time, the video seems to only scratch the surface of Nixon's life and career. There are many far superior documentaries of comparable cost and running time."
3,Murder Meets Magnum,"Although I always love to watch Tom Selleck walk around in shorts, this was not my favorite espiode. Murder She Wrote and Magnum are two great shows, hooowever, the writers of this particular espiode doees not capture either actor magic. ""Murder On Ice"" was much better.Also anyone who may want to see this espiode may like to check out A&E on cable, they are carrying the Magnum reruns."
4,Great Hymnal,"I remembered this hymnal from my childhood- - I recommend it to other ""old-timers"" who want to remember some great hymns"
4,alec vs noise god...,"its a great album.but sometimes you can become unfamiliar when you first hear merzbow's stuff.all you can do is close the lights,turn your speaker's high and close your eyes."
3,A little small,"This is a nice board book. Neat how you can feel different things like rough tires, smooth hoods, etc. I likeThat's Not My Tractor: Its Engine Is Too Bumpy (Usborne Touchy Feely)andMy First Tractor Board Book (My 1st Board Books)better. This book is kind of small and doesn't have a lot of pages. It's not the ""go to"" tractor book for my boys."
5,THIS IS ALMOST BETTER THAN VOLUME 1!!,"I LOVE THIS CD!! First of all, this covers Sammy's best period musically speaking - by that I mean the songs and arrangements were superb and Sammy rocked them all. As you may know, Sammy was on REPRISE records for most the 1960s and worked with some great arrangers (e.g. Don Costa, Marty Paich).I am also amazed how tender Sammy could be on ballads.Why is this almost better than Volume 1? Because by this time Sammy had more fully developed his style and his singing had more maturity and depth.Both of the CDs are great and Steve Hoffman had done a great job remixing a great bulk of these songs so the sound quality is top-notch!Swing cat!"
2,Can't believe I was so stupid!,"I live in London, and the DVD for season 6 came out, in its complete form, months before this DVD was released in the States. But I just had to see the alternate endings and deleted scenes. I thought I was being so smart. Nope, I was completely duped by HBO. Those alternate endings are paltry one minute variations on the final coffee shop scene. HBO- tell me something, what do the words ""alternate endings"" mean to you?! And only one deleted scene per season? Are they kidding? That's it? I spent how much for this?! And I could have had season 6, altogether on one disc. If only I had known. Don't let yourself get taken in by HBO. If you can find another way to get these episodes, go for it."
2,"The ""alternate endings"" are a joke!","Although I loved season six, everything about it really, including how it ended with all the characters the DVD set is ridiculous for touting the ""alternate"" endings as a great extra and incentive to pay extra money! It was a joke....the each are like one minute long and provide no plausible alternative ending...just suggestions of what may have happened. Very very silly. But worth having because I loved the series.....they should have put more thought into this and played out the entire alternate ending from beginning to end...I don't think they really shot three endings just these cheesey scenes to throw everyone off....."
2,DVD extras disappointing,"If you, like me, were waiting to view the alternate endings that the producers filmed, beware! The DVD does show three alternates, but they are the same scene (in the coffee shop) with one or two lines (by Sarah Jessica) altered in each. Each scene is no more than a minute long. I was bummed! The other ""extras"" are the retrospective that aired the night the series ended and a writer's panel which is mildly interesting."
2,Hmm... what's the fuss?,"My sister love this show but I personally find it not that interesting in comparison with a lot of other comedy show,sitcoms out there. Maybe it's a chick thing. I do not find it at all that amusing at times. The focus on sexual things makes the whole show rather meaningless. Their lines aren't very original.(...)"
2,just aight,"Sex in the city ended on a whimper to me.i thought it was gonna have more bang,but it went without much excitement.the show was on the way down from after year 3 truth be told to me.the writing&concepts got so predictable.as is the case with much of HBO shows they very seldom stay consistant past season 3.nowadays that is a very good run."
4,Someone wants to make money,"The first 5 years are all in one box each, but the last year gets split into 2, and both are full price?? I'm going to wait until season 6 is in one box. Good grief."
5,PLEASE DO NOT GIVE AWAY THE ENDING TO THE REST OF US,It's great to write a review on SATC but please don't give the endings away. That just ruins it all for the rest of us non-cable consumers who are going to be watching the last season for the first time.
4,Season 6 Part 2 - Will it include all 3 endings???,I agree with the earlier comments. What's going on with HBO? Why so long to release part 2?Does anyone know if all 3 endings will be included. Prior to airing the final episode I read that they had filmed 3 endings. One where Carrie ends up with Big. One where she ends up with the Russian and a third where she ends up alone.I would love to see all 3!
1,Just okay.,"I think the sex and the city shows are funny, but with part 2, and 1 of season 6 it's just not as funny as they used to be when the show first started out. Everything in season six was so obvious as far as what was going to happen. All the girls in season 6 I thought were just over dramatic about things, and it was just the same problems they were having in every episode. It was just boring. Don't buy it unless, you're a real big fan of sex and the city, it's not worth buying."
3,Alternate endings were terrible,"If you've already seen the last episode and wanted to buy this one for the purposes of seeing what the highly touted 'alternate endings' were, don't bother. They're illogical given where the new endings pick up and a complete cop-out on the part of the writers and producers. I was under the impression that if you didn't like the ending that aired on HBO, or wanted to see what else the producers had considered, maybe one of the other three endings would be to your satisfaction. But they're not really 'endings' at all. They start at the *very end* of the episode (as in the last minute or so). It's pretty lazy on the show's part to not start the alternate endings earlier in the show.The original ending ended on a stronger note than the alternates."
4,Finale season=great dvds?,"I have not seen this part at all as I did not HBO but I'm eagerly awaiting for it.I here have a press release with the technical details and it goes :Three-Much-publicized never before seen alternate endings to the series finale.Two farewell tributes as seen on HBO.Four essential audio commentaries by Michael Patrick King.Fun exclusive deleted scenes from Seasons 1-6.2004 U.S. Comedy Arts Festival Seminar featurin Sarah Jessic Parker, Michael Patrick King and the writers.3-Disc setRT:270 Minutes8 Episodes plus added value.Audio:English 5.1, English Dolby Surround, Spanish StereoSubtitles: English, French, Spanish.And as you can see already :Street Date 12/28/04Now mind you this is the Pre-Order information released by Warner/HBO and some technical aspects may vary by the time of the actual release."
4,"Great Show, but the Packaging Needs Work","Sex and the City is a fabulous show and this is one of the better seasons. I've watched these DVDs over and over, and while the episodes are always entertaining, the packaging leaves a little to be desired.The plastic case that all the DVDs come in starts to fall apart at the edges after opening it up several times. And there's no episode guide inside, so if you're looking for a particular episode, you'll have to put each DVD in your player to look for it, or search the web.I still recommend buying it though, because it's one of those DVD sets you'll watch over and over again. I feel like I got my money's worth, even if my cases do need some tape to stay together."
5,I So LOve Sex and The City,I so love Sex and The City. I have all of the series and I just can not get enough. It is such a true story about women and I can relate to all of these women in the show. I think that the show should have never being canceled because that means that I have to find some other show to watch and that is hard to do.
5,AMAZING!,DVD was delivered in a very timely fashion and was packaged as stated on information page of item. I will definitely do business again with this person! Thanks again!
1,Sex in the city- season six part 2,"My dvd arrived in a reasonable amount of time, however it was missing disk # 2 and they did not have a replacement to send so that sucked!!!"
2,"The ""not-so"" finale.","What can I say? I bought all the ""seasons"", enjoyed them all but the finale is not that surprising really. I always knew Carrie would end up with Big. That's what we - presumptuous & hopeless romantics - would want to see, right? Moreover, it's also amazing to watch all the characters seemed to have moved on except Carrie's - which explains the upcoming movie perhaps? I hope this flick will satiate my frantic quest for that absolute finale. Truly, I have more thrills and stimulation watching the early seasons as the storylines do live up to its title.... Sex and the City. (Onya, Samantha!!!!)"
3,International DVD of Series 6,"Like many, I will miss SATC, it was a truly special series. Rewatching season 1 the other night reaffirmed the appeal of this show. THe great characters, the ridiculous scenarios they were involved in, and the great comedy. Even if Series 5 onwards was a bit flat, but still managed to make me laugh. I will miss the girls.In America, Season 6 is split for its DVD release. The first half is available now, while the remainder is not due until after christmas. The Australian and UK DVD release contain the full series, except they miss out on the great special features that the impending American DVD (ie. second half of Season 6) will have.True fans will want it all ..."
4,decent season however....,.... season six was not as great as four in my opinion.. I am however perplexed as to why HBO did this in two parts and why in the world they would release it AFTER the holidays. You would think this would at least be out in time for Christmas to accumulate extra sales... bad move on their part. Whoever picked this date should have their job handed to them.
4,great book!,"This was a very interesting mystery and I really enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to reading the previous four books. It isn't often that I find a book set in my home province. I grew up near the main character's childhood home of Indian Head, Saskatchewan. Gordon does an excellent job of describing Saskatchewan."
1,Get Any Other Wagner DVD Instead,"Reading Amazon reviews should have warned me but, I was taken with the incredibly low price for a Blu-ray disc. You usually get what you pay for. The visuals are so awful, so ugly, that I just turned my head and listened to the music.One star only because it's Wagner and there are no ""negative stars.""I still can't believe it was so awful. Could it be a put-on?"
1,Technohype meets Eurotrash,"This is a truly hideous production, a marriage of gargantuan stage technology with conceptual drivel. Unlike others, for me the singing is undistinguished, the conducting pedestrian. I wonder if the staging is not just a huge send-up of the whole Wagnerian mythos and ethos. I'm sorry I wasted $10 on the highlights, but glad I didn't throw away over a $100 on the complete cycle."
4,Fond Memories,My husband and I love sitting quietly and listening to the old radio shows of our youth. It is somehow quieter and more restful than watching TV. It calls on you to use your imagination in the same way that a book requires you to call up mental pictures of the action.I would think anyone who remembers a time with no TV will enjoy this set. Younger people might even enjoy experiencing a different time when families gathered together around the radio and listened to wonderful shows. I would highly recommend it for many hours of entertainment.Shari Lyle-SoffeChildren's Author
4,A look at the past,"A classic. Anyone who has seen TV from the late 40s or early 50s will relate. The method for product placement is priceless. A little cheesy perhaps, and not subtle. But probably effective for its day."
3,Lloyd Nolan as Martin Kane,"Great Old Tv series from early days of television,The transfer to DVD was really bad the picture is grainy at times."
3,Well Built,"After our traditional Mr. Coffee espresso maker stopped working we decided to go the traditional route with the Vev Vigano Carioca Nero. I remember my parents using these when I was child therefore figured why not go this way for making espressos. With the many models out there we based our decision on price and number of shots it could produce. The results from the maker are pleasing particulary with the improved taste and boldness. As for output, we get approximately 2.5 cups each time. Not sure if this is expected but we cant seem to get a full 3 cups."
4,POWERFUL!,"How could anyone not like this? This is the ultimate revenge movie. Women are raped everyday in this country and most of these rapes go unpunished. Rosario Dawson actually gets justice in this movie. I've never seen anything like it. It's extremely graphic to say the least. She actually rapes the guy who raped her. An eye for an eye, thats what i live by. This movie shows how damaged a rape can leave someone. Even after Rosario gets revenge, you see how truly hurt and broken she is. I actually saw this about 2 years ago and it has stayed with me every since. It's a powerful film. The only reason i did not give it 5 stars was because it's a little to long. And there's this period after she was raped that seems to drag on way to long. However, This is still a wonderful film that i hope many people will take the time to watch. I didn't no Rosario had this in her. She's now one of my favorites. -This movie is definately A MUST SEE!"
1,Did not make much sense,"I'm not as articulate as some other reviews, but this is long and slow to watch. I can hardly watch the ear cutting scene in ""Reservoir Dogs"" because it is too graphic, or I'm getting too old. But I was expecting something like that in this movie. So when it never came I thought so what, whats all the 5 stars about. All I can say again is very long and arduous."
3,Disappointed,"The plot was about a victim getting even with the attacker. The story is very real of how majority of girls experienced on college campus in the US.The play is very weak. If the reason attracted you to watch this movie is to see Ms. Dawson naked, then you can forget about it - there is none. Towards the end, the film is more like a soft-core gay porn. The climax of the film is a very long sex scene between two men, the villain sexually avenged by the hero."
1,Poor!,"Dark and poorly made. I understand the rational of revenge, but was tasteless and not worth watching again. Would not recommend."
2,Boring and Senseless,"As a revenge movie, if that was the plot intent, it failed miserably. Having date sex forced upon her resulted in an almost mindless turn of attitude and personality resulting in the victim, Rosario Dawson, getting someone (another male) to rape the one who raped her. I believe the NC-17 rating was because of the extended view of male genitals and the Mano e Mano rape scene, but perhaps that was a good thing - it kept many from going to see it and wasting their money as I foolishly did. I like Ms. Dawson as an actress, but movies like this could ruin careers."
1,Descent,I don't know what movie the other reviewers were watching but this is not a good movie. The movie is about rape but you never see it on screen. It all takes place in a dark setting and it doesn't have a plot of any kind or any character build up. I hate when people have a chance to make a good movie and ruin it with stuff like this. If you buy this movie don't expect to much.
1,not for everyone,"could not watch i guess my internet connection is too slow.i tried several times over many days, movie would start and then stop, did'nt make it through the opening credits."
3,If you are a straight man do not watch this!,"The movie was boring for me all the way threw untill the end. The first rape was a shocker, I have to admit, but to sit threw what she does after the that scene and watch the rest of the events up untill the most desturbing thing I've ever seen in a movie. Like what everyone else says, I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone, but I must say that there should have been a warning or something on the movie about that last scene. (A small Spoiler: it is gay.)"
3,"""Extremities"" Pt. 2","Similar to the aforementioned film, this story follows a protagonist's ""descent"" into a moral abyss following rape. Unlike ""Extremities"" -- which occurs over the course of one day after the rapist tracks down his victim -- ""Descent"" uses jarring time jumps without really delving into the main character's decay. Dawson gives a strong performance, but the script, pacing, and sketchy motivation of characters detract greatly from the movie's intended power."
3,Hard to review...even harder to watch,"Not to be confused withThe Descent (Unrated Widescreen Edition)(which I loved, by the way!), this film focuses on the trials and tribulations of college coed, Maya, and how her life is affected after being raped. The movie made me quite uncomfortable in a couple of spots, so I guess it succeeded in that aspect. But after a certain point, I just said ""enough is enough"". I am not a woman and have no idea how a woman would feel after such an ordeal and this movie did not make me any more empathetic. It did, however, make me feel like I was watching something I shouldn't be. Watch the film if you must, but be prepared to squirm and then take a shower afterwards.."
4,Theology of Bonhoeffer,"An excellent commentary on the times of the Confessing Church of early 20th century Germany. Huntemann's treatment of Bonhoeffer's theology in light of B. historical context is excellent. Huntemann's interpretation of B. theology is refreshing in view of the numerous current misinterpretations of B. This book allows a unique perspective on the man, B. as well as the theologian."
4,Great book for the Northern Front Range hiker.,"I have hiked several of the trails described in the book and I agree with the author on ratings of the trails. The trail descriptions are well done and give you a very visual idea as to what you will experience on the trail. The directions to trails are pretty straight forward, and the maps are pretty good but a bit simple for my taste. The only real fault I have with the book is that there are no UTM or Latitude, Longitude info for the trailheads. Having this information would have made it easy to pull up my own research for the area. That one annoyance is the only reason I did not give it five stars."
4,History from an Irishman,"I liked the Irish history and enjoyed most if not all of the stories. There were times when I thought, ""Oh, no. Not another story by yet another storyteller."" But soon I was caught up in the new story and enjoyed the various personalities of all the storytellers in the book.I finished reading this book while hospitalized and think my fatigue may have caused me to wish the book had not been quite so long. It was nice to be able to reach over and get the book during the long nights when I couldn't sleep. I didn't need to turn the light on; I just pressed the power button on my Kindle and was able to read anytime.Ronan's family story and Ronan's fascination with the first storyteller in the book added to the appeal of the book for me."
3,Good fictional read,This book gave me some background into the myths and legends ofIreland while adding the linking thread of the young boy who was mesmerizedby the storyteller at an early age.
5,"Ireland, very enjoyable to read!",This story was a lot of fun. I loved the way the history was interwoven into the story of a modern day storyteller and a young boy's constant attempts to make connections with him. Very interesting ending!
5,Full and Enriched (Audio CD),"This is a full, lush book with its characters well-thought out and clearly described. The old stories and legends are captivating and it's easy to imagine the Storyteller holding court and keeping each person in his audience mesmerized. Hearing Frank Delaney read his own book as he wanted it to be heard is a joy; he has a magnificent narrator's voice, deep and resonant. I recommend this highly."
2,A chore to finish,"I love historical fiction, but this book falls very short for me. There are some nice stories between the lame one of the boy Rowan which is uninteresting and down right boring to me. I do realize whether or not a book is ""good"" is very subjective. But for me this book is shallow and leaves me wanting to read one that has more substance. If you like short summaries of various Irish events and very few details or ""Meat"" then this is the book for you. But if you feast on more in depth accounting of events that transport you back in time, keep looking. I am almost finished with the book and it is a chore to even pick it up. I am so ready for something by Sharon K. Penman. I was looking for a book that does for Ireland what she does for England. I will have to keep looking."
