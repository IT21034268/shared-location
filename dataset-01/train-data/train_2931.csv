1,How helpful are customer reviews?,"I read several customer reviews for this product (in other colors) before purchasing. I even did some research to learn why a burr grinder is better than a blade grinder. The consensus of the reviews rated this product pretty well (not great - but pretty well). What a joke! Buy this product only if you want ground coffee all over everything in your kitchen. If you want to fill the hopper (the lid of which fits very poorly) with beans and watch them just sit there while you have the grinder tuned on (and doing nothing) - then this is the right product. I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with KITCHENAID, from whom I expect higher quality appliances."
1,Dissapointment,"I was very dissapointd in this book. I am a lover of Harmony Korine's work both in film and in book form, but was not happy with this book. Though I have a love for modern art as well, this book is simply poor art. I Purchased the book here for tenty some dollars and sold it to my local bookstore for four dollars the next day, poor investment."
4,Cute baby gift,I purchased this book for friends who had their first baby. It makes a fun gift for creative people who want something a little different as a momento for their baby.
5,Fun gift,"I love this book, and everyone I have given it to states the same. It is my standard baby shower gift."
4,"Very entertaining, but too short","While we were looking for a baby book at the last minute, I came across this one. I figured this would make an interesting secondary baby book that could give everyone a few laughs down the road. It is a little short though. I think it could use a few more pages."
4,Funny Baby Book,"By no means would I recommend having this as your ONLY record keeper for your little one (I'm sure that you want to remember more than the first time your baby ""made bubbles"" in the bathtub.) However, for those of you not put off by potty humor, it might give you a chuckle. I would recommend it as a baby shower gift for your friends who have a sense of humor."
1,Not worth the money,"After reading several of the reviews, I purchased this book thinking it would provide laugh out loud hilarity. However, I was disappointed and the only reason I didn't send it back is because the total shipping would be more than I originally paid for the book. If you want to document obscure and funny events in baby's life, just jot it down at the back of the regular baby book or keep it in a journal. This way you won't be held down to what this author finds amusing, which is sometimes relevant, sometimes not even close. This is the aggravating part because the book is so short it can't afford to miss the mark nearly as often as it does. I am no prude; I was looking for some high brow crazy stuff, but this book totally fizzles in the gross-out, shock-value department."
2,Not as Funny as it looks,"Only 1 item per page, and very few pages, and none of it is as funny as some other books out there, such as Baby's First Tattoo."
2,Baby Book,I purchased this baby book for my 2nd daughter & it's nothing like I expected. I wish I would've gone to a store & looked at some before making a purchase. I will be looking for a new one that has everything in it I'm looking for.
2,Not what I expected..,"It's a shorter story and a smaller book than I expected. Yes, some of the ""memory moments"" are funny in their phrasing, but I was disappointed.I'm sure I'll still use it. I guess it serves it's purpose."
4,Cute for those who can handle it,I wouldn't give this book to any of my humorless-uppity friends. But definitely for anyone with a sense of humor (with a little twist) would enjoy this book. Nice graphics. Nice size. Not too long and not too short. Juuuuusssst right.
5,Baby book review,"Too cute! This book is perfect for a non-traditional parent, or just an addition to the traditional baby book for the comical moments of parenting."
1,Book-Exploitation,$210 for this book? I think the author might be doing a little exploitation of his own...
1,There is something you can do.,"Yes, this book is correct, many women date/marry/have sex with men for financial/material rewards (dinner, diamonds, the suburban dreamhome). But men: You keep ending up with shallow materialistic golddiggers because you pursue women who look like shallow materialistic people with nothing better to do than spend all their time preening. The book does not explain that if you want a woman of substance and independance who respects you, you'll have to accept that she will not look like a made-up Barbie doll. She will be beautiful, but since she is independant and complex, she really doesn't have the time or need to fluff up her hair. You will get what you go after: superficial beauty or deep substance. This book just gives angry men a convenient punching bag."
5,Daring and to the point,"Well, at least it SOUNDS daring and to the point. Too bad that this book isn't offered by your German branch. I'm all fed up with books depicting gender relations only from the female perspective. How come if there IS a book written from the male perspective every once in a blue moon it is so difficult to get your hands on it?"
2,Price is listed at $1204.93. Can this be right??,"Price is listed at $1204.93. Can this be right?? I am reading the reviews, and might want to read this book, but for a 100-page rant, I can't see paying that much money! Must be a misprint of some kind, but I won't buy until it's fixed. Also, I'd like to read it on Kindle for PC. Thanks!"
1,misfits,"Get a life!!! Before sharing your thoughts on such an important topic, be receptive to others' experiences You sound biased & overly judgmental As a female, I could sing similar tunes of many men whom I have met!!! We are all on a path & should be consciously sensitive to each others' journeys"
1,Demented,"This book is disgusting. It has neither sociological relevance, nor anthropological relativism. Its message should be disregarded, as it is highly prejudiced, sexist, and is written only for shock value."
5,Truly Honest,"I could type for hours - but simply, this book is the only true and accurate description of women I have ever read."
2,why is it that?,"Why do men get upset when women try to split the bill?Why do men, time and time again, choose the gold-digging woman over ""career"" women?Hello, if you choose the type of woman who invests in her looks like other women invest in their careers, do not be surprised when she turns out to be a gold digger!That little traditional type may end up controlling more than you expect."
5,EVERYTHING MOTHER WOULDN'T SAY AND DAD DIDN'T KNOW,I READ THESE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING THIS BOOK.AFTER HAVING READ THE BOOK I FEEL THE COUPLE OF NEGATIVE REVIEWS WERE WRITTEN BY PEOPLE WHO LEAD VERY SHELTERED LIVES OR WON'T EXCEPT THE TRUTH.UNFORTUNATELY FOR MEN THIS BOOK IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE
3,This book seems to only be one-sided.,"The author of this book makes some strong points about manipulative women, but those points only apply to a certain type of woman---not all women in general. As an strong, independent single mother of two boys, I'll be the first to tell you that there are real women out there in the world who do not depend on men finanically. Obviously, this author is a magnet for these psychic vampires, as that seems to be the reason for his bitter and resentful generalization of women. Personally, I have met many men in my life who were just as immoral in some way, but I've also met many moral, upstanding men. Therefore, I would never write a book denouncing all men."
2,Whose fault is this?,"One must question whether this is the fault of the female, or the fault of the male for putting up with these nonsense behaviors. Sure, women use their bodies to extort money, but only because some of us men will PROVIDE the money they crave. Men stop providing the money, and BAM, problem solved.The moral of the story is this: Never compromise your self-integrity for women. I promise, you can still get _plenty_ without being a (...) supplicating loser."
4,A reviewer from Colorado,"The author did seem to beat the issue a bittoo much but his ideas are to be taken seriously.Shortly after reading the book I had theopportunity ? to have dinner with a woman I had met.Halfway through the dinner she remarked that she waslooking for a man who could ""take care "" of her.The alarms immediately sounded and thanks to thebook I was ""saved"" from spending any more money ortime with her. I only wish I had the book priorto my marriage and subsequent divorce from a womanwho was similar to the ""date."""
1,Disappointed,"I started reading this book and at first I agreed with the author that women manipulate men by using sexual seduction in exchange for money but then the book becomes very much useless and quite annoying because the author keeps repeating this same concept ad nauseum and ignores many other facets of manipulations used by women. The book contains a lot of fallacies and wrong information: the author claims that women do not enjoy sex but use it only to get a man's money. That's very wrong, women enjoy sex and engage in casual sexual relationships just for the pleasure. In addition many women would go for a handsome interesting man even though he doesn't have a lot of money. The author seems to be one of those frustrated guys who couldn't score and who were posting on newsgroups about how women are evil. I expected a much deeper analysis about the manipulative manoeuvers women engage in but instead got some sort of a teenage boy rant."
2,expected more...,Esther's book (the manipulated man) is much better. I didn't find in this book anything new or profound. It is supposed to be the sequel to Esther's book but I didn't find anything special that has expanded my knowalge...
2,"Strange, paranoid point of view","The trouble with Fitzgerald's point of view is that anyone can see gender relations as a battlefield - if that's how you decide to look at things. You can see anyone as manipulative if you tend to think that way. A real relationship is based on mutual knowledge, communication, friendship. If you don't know each other, then all you have left is manipulation."
5,Funny,"This show has some really funny episodes, it also like the Secret Show should still be on Nickelodeon. Sometimes the cartoon shows are better than adult shows this is one of them!"
5,Great product,"I have used a great many saline nasal products over the years and Rhinaris Mist is the best I've come across. The solution is basically the same in all saline products, but Rhinaris transcends the competition due to its exceptional spray apparatus. It produces a fine, even mist from the perfect amount of solution, for me at least, and remains properly primed even when left unused for extended periods. Unless you're looking for a specific composition or ingredient, e.g. menthol, this product is highly recommended.Active ingredients: Sodium chloride (0.2%)Inactive ingredients: Benzalkonium chloride solution, Polyethylene glycol, Potassium phosphate monobasic, Propylene glycol, Purified water, Sodium phosphate dibasic"
5,Goodbye Dry Nose!,"Late at night, early in the morning, and on plane rides is when I most frequently suffer from a dry nose passageway, but not anymore! I've tried several products (Ayr, Afrin, etc) and they aren't as good and simple as Rhinaris. It's not only cheaper than most other saline nasal sprays but the way it sprays into the nose is in a light mist which is great. Some other products have stronger sprays or the stream is too strong and irritates my nose. I love this product. It's small enough to take on plane rides and also doesn't take up room on a desk or in the bathroom counter."
5,nose relief,Rhinaris nasal spray may not cure all your nose problems but it has been a big help for my situation.I'm not as dry stuffed up as before and can finally sleep better.
5,Great Sound,"This sound system comes with heaps of base, and the subwoffers are very effective. Great quality! Great price! Great Sound!"
4,ok for amusing yourself with simple tunes,"first, click on the book image here to 'see inside' and look at the table of contents to know what tunes are inside. most are folk or popular tunes; for just straight playing simple tunes this book is ok, esp for the price; david harp has a good , easy method/tablature for reading and playing the music, so dont worry about that. i only wished there were some better songs in it."
1,CD Not Included,Book is very basic and the CD was not shipped with the book. All the same books here localy have a practice CD included with the book.So make sure you get what is offered.CheersJim
2,some notes are wrong,"the notes in the ""Amazing Grace"" are just wrong. They try to keep all the songs simple and end up substituting notes that just have no correct simple substitution."
3,Decent For the Money But...,"This is a pretty decent little book for the money: the song selection is pretty good, the tab he uses, while a bit different, is easy to understand, it has a simple primer and it's nice sized to actually carry in your pocket.I'd have to say my only real complaint is that he uses the book for advertising his other books and material way too much. I could understand an occasional plug but this guy's over the top. Not only does every chapter have at least one reference to another of his products but the last 2 pages are dedicated to listing them all, too. I wanted a book, not an infomercial.I'd say overall I'm please with the purchase but the author's endless self-promotion in this book has sort of turned me off any other titles by him."
2,The Pocket Harmonica Songbook,"Yeah, this series is fine if you're looking for a book to help you learn, but what I really wanted was a songbook. Most of the songs in this are in every other learn-to-play book out there, so didn't expand my playlist.Also, it's not actually pocket sized. The title and the long narrow shape suggests that it is small enough to stick in your pocket and carry around with your harp, but unstead it's oversized and unmanagable."
2,I thought thsi book was borning,"Why did alot of people give thsi book 5 stars ?! It's not even worth that!First of all I really dont understand why Carol Ellis named the book ""The StepDaughter"" why didn't she name it ""The Stepfather""? since it had alot to do it Livvie trying to find out if her stepfather was a killer. When the book begans it is very exciting the way the author describes how Livvie found out that her stepfather was a killer one night when she was watching ""Fugitives from Justice."" Livvie sees a man that looks just like her stepfather who killed his stepdaughter and wife in a fire one night. Livvie starts to snoop around and ask her stepfather alot fo questions about his past. After Livvie goes on Spring Break with her mother the book goes down hill from there. This book was NOT a thriller at all, I think all books from Carol Ellis are boring because she doesn't try hard enough to keep the reader gluded to the book."
2,Not authentic,"Well Music is certainly subjective. This was rated 5 stars by 5 people, and if you want to listen to at least 75% cruise ship orchestra caribbean, this is the one for you! Personally, I found it very disappointing. In only several pieces does the real steel drum music come out, and I would suppose it was recorded from a few sources to get so much orchestra included.I have a slow dial-up connection, so I am not able to review the music before buying. So...you will get burned once in a while.I'll rate this one at 2 stars, and thats generous. Incidently, I know what real steel drum music sounds like, this is not, except for the several pieces I mentioned out of the 12 included. To each his own! If you REALLY want some steel Drum music, get STEEL DRUM GOLD by Bob Lyons. This is the real deal, and beautiful too!"
3,Island muzak,The cuts on this disk are not pull-you-up-out-of-your-seat-and-get-you-dancing. This is a good disk if you are having a Caribbean-themed luncheon and want to play some appropriate music unintrusively in the background. But for something to energize the dance floor -- not this disk.
2,Hope,"I like about three songs on this double CD set. I'm not really a Hillsong fan and the music is a bit on the wild side for me. I do like some upbeat music, but I'm more of a fan of mellow praise and worship - like the early days of Hosanna Music. To me, this CD is far from the praise and worship that I'm used to. Some of the music on this CD sounds more like a rock concert than an actual praise and worship concert."
3,FUN but NOT durable,"We bought this toy last Christmas for my two boys. We were so excited and so were the kids. Yes it did take a while to blow up but we assumed it would last so that was o.k. Within 1 month the side, blue bars were losing air. After a few months it got a huge hole in one of the bars. My children are 2 and 3 so they did not play extremely rough to cause the holes. You can not take it down and put it up easily and there is no way to anchor it to the ground so weather will play havic on this toy. After about 4 months we chunked it because the kids were so upset that it would not fully inflate and support them (a whooping 24 pounds at the time). For the price the toy does not last the way it should."
4,Toys lasts about a week without holes,"Three boys 100#, 60# and 50#. The big boy can't play on it. The other two have to take turns. Just like most of the reviewers of this toy, ours lasted one week on a tarp on the finished tile floor of the basement before it developed a leak in the base and two leaks in the bars. Blowing this thing up is like a reality TV challenge show without the big prize... 17 holes, the plastic plugs don't fit and even with a super pump took well over an hour. If you use it inside, beware that the kids can fall off and hit their head or themselves. If you use it outside, put a tarp under it because the grass and ground will cause holes. We patched the two holes and moved it outside yesterday. The heat helped to keep the bars stiff enough to play on, but the base has another hole to patch. We put water in the base to keep it sturdy. Its alot of work for a little bit of fun. Hopefully it being outside will kill it by summer's end and we can throw it out without guilt!"
3,"Great for 10 days, then sprung a leak","My 4 year old had a fantastic time with this for 10 days, and then the base got a leak by one of the post holes. Don't have much hope for patching it, since it's at a seam.So sad, but great fun while it lasted."
5,Buy This NOW !!!!,Juno Reactor kicks ***. This is trance and guitars and at its best. It suits all moods and is perfect for the high life. KOMIT and CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT are the best tunes - so get listening.
5,YES!!! This is the stuff I've been looking for!!!,"If you like complex and high energy techno, this is the group for you. Bible of Dreams is the best of the J.R. albums but the others are close behind. Also check out Paul Oakenfield and BT. Of my collection, these guys are the most similar."
3,Mind Blowing Techno Rock Thate Fades Fast,"Very exciting and mind blowing CD that combines big beat techno in the Chemical Brothers tradition with a fresh set of inspirations like African jungle rhythms and eastern vocals. My favorites are tracks #1,2 & 5 as the best examples of this. Although it comes on strong with in your face beats and blasts, it also tends to fade pretty fast after a couple of listenings after the novelty wears off. The reason being the songs are actually quite simple in structure and essentially follow your basic hard rock drum beat underneath the heavy synth sounds."
4,Juno Reactor - Bible of Dreams,"While the album, all around, is pretty good, the tracks aren't very stand-out. While I enjoy it, it is not something I listen to every day."
2,Juno Reactor's Weakest Effort,"I was really dissappointed with this album. Having heard Juno Reactor's great work on such compilations as the Mortal Kombat Soundtrack, Mortal Kombat: More Kombat, the Matrix soundtracks and their album Labyrinth I was expecting a really great album here. But I found almost none of the compositions here were as intriguing and the audio engineering was much worse. I don't know what happend, but none of the tracks have the same punch as any of the other albums mentioned. Frusterating. :-("
5,thank you,"these guys introduced me to the world of trance house and i thank them with all my heart, i love them, i have everything i can by them, and its great, transmissions is bland and sounds like bible..., but more primitive if thats believable, and the second album rox just as much as this one, they are great are extremely underestimated"
2,the best reference available on Tobago birds,"I used ffrench's guide for a month of birding on Tobago, and found many mistakes. The plates are incomplete and inaccurate (the chachalaca, Tobago's national bird, is not given a color plate), the ""range and subspecies"" descriptions are confusing, the English names are not up-to-date with current ornithological classifications, and it is just plain difficult to use. I give it two stars instead of one because it is pretty much the only guide for Trinidad and Tobago birds available, so if you plan to do any bird watching on Trinidad or Tobago, you're better off with this book than without it. One of the biggest problems is that ffrench often does not include plates of common North American birds (the broad-winged hawk, for example), so if you are not familiar with North American birds, I suggest you also bring another field guide, such as Sibley's or Peterson's."
3,Go with the Kenefick guide for field birding in T&T.,"I purchased both the Ffrench and Kenefick books for birding in T&T. I much preferred birding with the Kenefick guide. Better photos and easier to manage in the field. Ffrench book has more detailed text but not as good for an in-the-field guide. Ffrench book better left at home for more in-depth info on each species. Didn't like the way the color plates were arranged, either."
5,Green with envy,"...I am very much outside this book's intended audience, to say the least...The photos border on Arbus-esque but offer a more compassionate less spectacle treatment of the subjects. I guess that's a point well demontsrated when the phographer spends as much time in front of the camera as well as behind. You are more inclined to look at these unusual subjects with reverence not repulsion. The book overall is beautifully put toether. Sparse and poignantly so..."
3,PICTURES OF WOMEN WHO BECAME MEN,"Loren CameronBody Alchemy:Transsexual Portraits:Photographs(San Francisco, CA: Cleis Press, 1996) 110 pages(ISBN: 1-57344-063-9; hardcover)(ISBN: 1-75344-062-0; paperback)(Library of Congress call number: HQ77.95.U6C36 1996)This large-format book contains about 40 full-page pictures,about half of which include the photographer/author herself/himself.All of the subjects are female-to-male transsexuals.Some explanation of their transitions to very convincing menare included with their pictures.There is very little exploration of the reasonsfor deciding to become men, but the results are shown.Each picture is a success story of transition from woman to man.You might also find other first-person stories interesting.Search the Internet for this bibliography: ""Transsexualism--Autobiographies""."
4,Dreams can Come True,"I purchased this book as a gift for a f2M friend of mine who drew a LOT of hope from it. Loren's camera and words have a strong impact. Understanding one's self, our true nature, is vital. Body Alchemy is a valuable lesson in that."
2,Comfortable but isn;t upto the mark,"After going through reviews , i was very optimistic about it but the moment i plugged it in to listen music, i was highly disappointed.As everyone has pointed out, its very very comfortable and one can wear it for hours in a stretch but it is disappointing in producing quality sound.High notes get mixed up and bass is too loud. overall, it sounds like an average headset which i can actually say it is for its price. So, you will be happy if you don't expect any sound quality since it is pretty mediocre otherwise its a good buy."
2,Average Quality,"I use headphones everyday at work, so headphones are constantly taken on/off...after about 2months both adjustable sides have BROKEN...granted I have a large size HEAD so a smaller headed person may not require the amount of adjustment I do and possibly will not break, but mine has broken although it is still functional and I continue to use....sound is average..."
2,I guess you get what you pay for,"I purchased these headphones about 6 months ago, and within 2 weeks of use the left side speaker started having issues and would intermittently lose the lower frequencies. The sound quality isn't what I expected either - flat sound, low bass (even with both speakers working), and overall a disappointing experience. This might be a decent pair of headphones for gaming or something, but I wanted the best sound for music and movies, and this product just hasn't delivered. I wouldn't recommend buying this product - spend a little more and buy something better."
4,overall excellent,"I am not an audiophile and have never owned expensive headphones so please consider my review with a grain of salt.PROS:-comfortable-cheap-long cord-self adjusting ear cups-rich sound at low volumesCONS:While playing my mp3 player at 1/2 of the highest potential volume, there is still enough noise leakage at indoor noise levels for people right outside a closed door about 6 feet from where I am to hear the lyrics clearly.I really like these phones but privacy is important to me. I don't want people to know what song/audiobook I am listening to nor disturb them with music.Read most of the reviews but there was little or no mention of noise leakage."
4,Comfortable And Fit Nicely,"These headphones adjust and fit well over my head and ears. I'd say the sound quality is just average. Not great, but not terrible either."
4,Good product for the price,Good sound (may be better than comparable sony headphones)good quality (ear pieces move horizontally and vertically[a little] for better adjustment and comfort)less clumsy (wire on one side only )would recommend it for basic to moderate use
5,This is the best of the four that I tried.,"I have tried the JVC HARX500, the Sennheiser HD 202, the JBuds J2, the Sony MDR-XD200, the Koss KSC75, and the Panasonic RP-HT21, and finally the JVC HARX500 all together. The JVC HARX500 is the most comfortable AND sounds the best, the treble and bass are perfect and I can wear these for hours without being tired. For some of the others like the Sennheiser and the Koss the treble is high pitched and whistley. The JVC also has better Bass and is more comfortable than the Sony. The Sennheiser HD202 was too high pitched and the ear cups were small and not comfortable for long periods. The only thing about the JVC is that it doesn't block outside noise that well like a set of cheap peltors would."
3,OK for teen games,"My son loves this and uses it for in room TV/internet/gaming/music. Very effective reproducing driving and other sound effects. Good value for the price for this application. Works well over glasses.My older, trained ears found the sound quality not to taste. The speakers lacked recovery after producing a sound; so complex, clean music sounds are not reproduced as well as similar priced headphones from Sony and Sennheiser."
3,Could be better,"Not what I thought it was going to be. Messy unclear highs, muddy mids, and the lows were not deep or loud enough. Aside from that not bad at all for the price. I guess like all things. If you want quality you got to pay for it. Overall just ok."
4,JVC HARX500,"Good headphones. Price is very reasonable for what you get. Non-pro headphones, but for sound and video editing is right. Recomended for watching movies, videogames and hearing music.Pros:- Good bass- Long cable (could be cons)- ConfortableCons:- Construction most of plastic- Not so good isolating external soundsButton line:You won't regret buying it, in deed I'm very pleased. For only $20 is a must have headphones. Highly recommended."
3,Good Sound & Cheap Construction,"These headphones have a nice sound. They are also very light weight and comfortable. However, they did arrive damaged. The left speaker did not work. This is a typical problem for cheap headphones and a good indication of the quality of this line of headphones. IMO, the cord is very narrow, the hinges are weak, and the headphones are constructed of 90% plastic. Provided you are delivered a pair of headphones that are not already damaged, you will have a set of very comfortable and good sounding headphones. At least until they break."
5,JVC HARX500 Over-the-Ear Headphones,"ok i had toughts about buyin this products because of some online reviews by other buyers..but after i gave up and bought it anywaes... i NEVER regretted buying these headphones..the sound quality is GREAT..the noise cancelation is 90%,,, dnt hesistate and buy this product because u wont regret it...i take these headphones where ever i go and it really help and ive got alot of compliments for these heaphones... the problem is wire is kinda too long and i have to fold it..and that doesnt even cause any mayham..dis headphones are awsome..they actually in my ears while im writing this review..good luck... i'd rate it a 5 starts for everything it has and its quality"
1,"Big cans, soft cushion, muted/muffled sound","Somewhat disappointing headphones. Pros: long cable, soft cushion. Cons: cable is thin and flimsy, causes hotness in the ears - no air goes thru, sound is muted/muffled. I use them as output from my Philips Hi-Fi system. Not sure why so much praising goes around."
3,$20 buys average...,"You Get What you PAY for. These are not good headphones. They do not block out noise anymore than any other headphones. The sound quality is average. Most people can live with that.These headphones provide average sound quality, normal comfortability, and will provide service for a reasonable amount of time. The seller got them to me within a week and in good condition.All for $20. You Can't Beat That."
4,Does the job at a low price,Works fine for simple use.Stopping purchases through Amazon until they 1) claim they chose to socially cease to interact with WikiLeaks and Assange or 2) stand up for themselves and tell USA gov't to back off the pressure to squeeze out Assange et al.
2,Think really hard about the cable,"Docking two stars because the cable is so long it ended up destroying the head phones. Had the cord half way wound up and tied together but the dang thing still got caught in the wheels of my chair without me realizing and when I went to move a bit the thing broke into pieces. Docking another star because even while they were working if you jostled the cable too much the sound would get really distorted, basically I've had a lot of problems with its cable."
1,Broken in less than 10 weeks,Bought the headphones in July and the right speaker stopped working in October. Unable to return to Amazon and JVC didn't reply. Now they are just another electronic item in a landfill.
3,Good for the price,"The sound is good--not the best, but the price is right and they are comfortable. Unlikely you will find a better product at this price."
5,Great Headphones,You couldn't hear a dump truck driving through a nitroglycerin plant with these on. Great if you need to cancel out background noise.
5,Great phones for a great price,"I'm certainly no audiophile by any stretch of the imagination, but these headphones are really good for what I have needed them for and were a great price. They are very comfortable. Occasionally, they can feel just slightly tight or annoying, but they are not bad at all. The padding is just right. I can even wear them with my glasses just fine. I was in a store one day listening to sample soundtracks with some Koss headphones they had set up for that. Those headphones were SO uncomfortable that it made me VERY GLAD for my JVC's I had at home. The phones do not do much outside noise canceling at all, but the sound coming from the phones is great."
1,Product Warrantee,"I gave this product one star ""not"" because it was inferior, but of the warrantee. Warning, JVC no longer carries this product in stock so they will only replace this product in regards to the price you've paid for it. So if you're a bargain shopper, you'll end up with less than what the product is worth. For example, a $100 item at 90% off will be $10 (plus minus sales tax etc). JVC will allow you to replace this item with a new item valued at only $10. My HA-RX500 full size over the ear headphones soon was reduced to the HA-FX20-BR ear buds."
4,Good Value,"When I first put these on, the sound was so harsh and colored that I nearly returned them. They were unbarable even for a $15 headphone. I then decided to let them break in a little. I set them on my desk and let them play to nobody. After a couple of hours, they've settled in nicely. They aren't audiophile quality, but they are nice. They have a decently balanced sound across their frequency range. I set the EQ on my iPod Classic to treble boost and I'm quite pleased. They will do for a cheap, comfy headset that I can afford to lose/replace as necessary. I use them when travelling."
4,Love these headphones....but a lot of plastic,"After reading a lot of reviews about many different headphones I decided to buy these ones based on the good comments about comfort and for $20.00 they were very good value. I received them yesterday so have used them very little however the sound quality is excellent and they are very comfortable, fitting over the ear easily and blocking out peripheral sounds, however they are a bit plasticy and I doubt they will last long which is my main concern and the reason why I gave 4 stars instead of 5."
4,Good Product,"The JVC HARX500 earphones are good earphones. They are a good product, and you get what you pay for. I can put them on, turn them up, and not bother the people around me. Fair product in my opinion."
4,earphones,"Product received on time and in good condition. Earphones are still undergoing the breakin period. The over the ear fit is very good. The sound is clear and very nice in the mid to low range. After listening to classical thru metal, I can recommend this earphone to anyone looking for value and quality. The one drawback for me is the extremely long cord. Since I use this earphone with either my ipod or computer, there is a lot of extra cord. The big plus with this earphone is having a single cord to one side and still being able to enjoy stereo separation."
3,"Not bad for the money, but not what I was hoping for.","I just purchased these headphones off the ratings that were given by others. I received them and was not impressed at the sound quality at all. They sound muffled and not crisp. I know I can't complain too much due to the low expense of the headphones, but I expected slightly more and was disappointed."
4,Good for the price.,I wasn't expecting high fidelity recording quality headphones and I did not get that either. But what I did get was a good quality pair of headphones that sit comfortably on my head and have good sound. The only issue I have is the plastic around the plug is a tad thicker that on most headphones and prevents the headphones from being able to be fully plugged into my iPhone with an otter box case on it.
4,Comfortable,"The only issue I have with these headphones is the lack of a volume control. If I put my TV on fixed volume it is too loud. If it could be turned down it would be great. If I put the TV on variable I have to turn the TV sound way up and then mute it,"
5,Comfortable headphones,Great headphones for price. Good sound.They were a little larger than expected and warm ears after a while of listening.I would recommend.
3,"Great price, ok headphones","These are comfortable light weight headphones. They're $20. They are easy drive (ipod, computer) Those are the clear pluses here.I own more expensive Sony and Byerdynamic headphones. If I did not own those I might think these sounded pretty good. The range is decent. In other words they have bass and trebile. Mids are there too.The real problem with these, sound wise, is the detail. They are severely lacking in this area (muddy). Music that sounds clear and dynamic on my DT990's is just awful. My $80 Sony's have much more response too.Again, $20 and very comfortable. I might search a bit higher up the cost line for budget headphones next time."
3,Plastic headphones,"Using these headphones the sound it pretty good. The fault is they are pretty flimsy and all plastic. For sure these will be broken in no time but if it wasn't for the good sound, they would have been sent back. Three stars for the sound only."
3,GOOD SOUND BUT DOESN'T WORK LEFT EARPHONE,I think it's better sound quality than Sony and also comfortable than it.But suddenly the left earphone stopped to work at the same day delivered.And I had to return it back.
5,Sweet Quad Video,"This is must for the Huevos collection. Sweet quads, nice women, everything a rider needs in a video."
5,DVD ITSELF DESERVES A GOLD MEDAL!!!,"Outstanding compilation of what the Winter Olympic Games in 1998 were all about...Champions.Watch Lu Chen as she is overcome by emotions....who places third but wins for herself!Watch Ilia Kulik grace the ice to become one of the best skaters of our time.See the young and now perhaps forgotten Tara Lipinski as she wins the gold. See the makings of the youngest winner for the gold, and enjoy the last elgible skate this young woman will ever perform...And love the beautiful multiple World, National, and Olympic medalist Michelle Kwan skate her heart out to the most beautiful programs ever where she will place a forever debatable 2nd place.With enjoyable fact s and special features this dvd is hard to pass up. A little piece of history that we may look back to in 2006 and think of how young the future Olympic Gold Medalist Michelle Kwan really was. Fantastic!"
1,Read Carefully,"I did not read the real small print at the top saying it was a ""pocket guide"". My mistake, I thought I was getting a book for $10, but literally is the size of the palm of my hand. Mostly just definitions which are taught in grade school. Not very impressed for the money. I think Webster's dictionary is cheaper."
3,from the back cover: (since amazon doesn't provide any editorial reviews),"Jake Radovich had tried to be a good friend during Don Talbot's illness. he'd provided a shoulder for Clare, Don's beautiful new wife, to cry on. he's been a surrogate uncle to Don's young son. Jake wasn't fooling himself about his motives though - don was his friend, but Jake was in love with Don's wife. And Don knew it. Did Clare?Now Don is dead but the passions and resentments friendship once held in check are stilla live and about to flare out of control...."
1,Not worth it,"These tables are not good quality. The first ones I ordered arrived broken. I contacted the seller and they sent me a new set. These also arrived broken. The legs are not sturdy, the base had to be glued down. The wood cracks easily. Totally not worth the money or the effort."
4,Great Product for the Price!!!!,How can you beat the price!! Everthing works great. I would definetly recommend.
5,Memories,"I followed Al through Springdale School by 8 years. How the memories flooded back. So much relates to Small Town USA everywhere during the depression. Summer farm stories when families fled the towns fearing Infantile Paralysis are particularly nostalgic for all of us who forked hay in the mow, milked the cows and hoed the corn. No electricity, kitchen wood stove. It is all there and very well written"
3,ripoff game,"i just bought this game, and it's pretty good. the only problem i have with it, is it is like tony hawks pro skater 2, but a bmx version. i enjoyed the first game better. plus what i think is better about tony hawks game is that he kept all of the original people in the second game. i was very upset to see that the coolest rider, chad kagy wasn't in the game. plus why did they make ""dave mirra maximum remix"" with new levels when they should have put those levels in the new game?? alls i can say is that its a pretty good game but i hope that if they make a dave mirra 3, i hope that they dont ripoff tony hawks game"
3,THIS GAME IS ALRIGHT!!!,"this game is alright.i would say that it is a whole lot better than dave mirra 1.but i think it is better to rent than to buy it.though it has GREAT graphics!!!!.you will be sooo suprised how great these graphics are!!. but if i had to choose tony hawk's pro skater or matt hoffman's pro BMX vs. dave mirra, i would have to say tony hawk and matt hoffman.basically think twice before you buy this game!!!"
1,Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2: A Big Flop!,"This game has good graphics, but that is about it! The first time that i played this game i scored 400,000 points. This game is way too easy, and they should have made it more challenging. I don't suggest anyone to buy this game because it is not worth 50 dollars of anyones money!"
5,So much fun,"I'm having so much fun with this game. the tricks are pretty easy, but it's hard to grind"
5,Best bike game I've ever played,"If you like Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2, then you'll like this one. This game is awsome...Interactive environments, great courses, and great soundtrack. The only flaw to this is the angle, but in the end you get use to it."
2,Bad Views,"I didn't like this game at all. I might've liked it, if not for the horrible camera views. I may just be bad at the game, but I found the controls confusing...And I found it a waste of time to turn the camera around so it faces the player, making you turn around...The above view gave me a head ache...Stay away from this game...Bad graphics for the ps2."
3,A fun PS2 Game,"This game eliminates boredom and allows one to enjoy their PS2 machine. This game is fun and interesting. Enjoy, have fun gaming!"
3,Trip down memory lane,"I used to love this game as a kid, but got rid of the gamecube. The XBOX and Gamecube versions are better, they have additional levels and other features, but this is still good."
4,FUN FUN FUN,"the game if fun, you can choose from your favorite bmxers, and bikes. If you like the x games this is the game to get. It good because it isn't like the concept of matt hoffmans and tony hawk because they are a like this is new. there are three sets of tricks per level. This game was fun and exciting. After beating all the levels, besides playing a two player it was somwhat gets borning."
4,Good snack,Good tasting snack. I though that the flavors would be alittle stronger...but still good. You really can not tell that there are sesame or poppy seeds on them....but I guess they are there. Very crispy and not at all salty.
3,Be careful in upgrading memory,Machine comes with 2 512mb memory sticks installed. My guess is that with Vista many owners will want to upgrade. If you do DON'T THROW THE OLD MEMORY AWAY. If you ever have to use the Sony supplied recovery disks they will not restore your system if you have anything but the original 2 512MB of memory. Got that one straight from the Sony support desk in Manila just a few minutes ago.
2,Nice Notebook,"This is a nice notebook computer. Vista runs slow. Amazes me how much software I presentily own that won't work with Vista. Contacted Sony about replacing Vista with XP Home and got a ""no"" answer. Drivers for the computer are Vista only. Like I said, happy with the Sony Vaio but Vista can take a hike."
4,Slow Vista,It's great with price and spec...but disappointed of slowly run Vista....too bad for owning vista.
5,Excellent !!!,"I bought it like 2 months ago and I've been using it and it just works great, the 2.0 GHZ processor is awsome, really fast, and the dvd/cd burner and the 120 gb are great too !! the monitor size is perfect and really cool graphics, really recommend buying it , the prize is worth it."
4,Solid Laptop,I've been very pleased with this notebook. As the others have said you'll definitely want to upgrade the RAM though. I threw in an extra 2GB stick I had laying around alongside one of the 512s already in there. Works great.I ditched Vista for Windows 7 (worked well especially after memory upgrade) and am currently running Ubuntu Linux 10.04. Everything works seems to work great so far.
1,Crashed twice within one year - had to restore all data from scratch,"Disappointed with Sony and this product (running Windows Vista ;(((. The computer crashed twice within a year. The reason was that the boot file was damaged. Asked Sony if I can create a backup boot disc - no one can give me a straight answer! You can restore the computer to its original purchased state, however, who will pay me for all my lost time - Gates or Sony Corp?? I should send tnem an invoice ;))."
3,"OK Laptop, But Not for Gamers","This is a pretty nice laptop, especially since we acquired it on sale for only 6 bills ($600). But beware...there is only 32MB of video and there is absolutely nothing you can do to upgrade it. Video memory is not usually advertized on laptops. I only found this out when I tried to install Age of Empires III and it would not run. 32MB is a preposterously low amount of video memory for ANY system in this day and age. So, HEADS UP, if you just want to do the normal email, basic internet, etc, it's OK. Otherwise, steer clear. There also a huge pile of bloatware on this computer, but that's easy to get rid of."
2,"Please Jody, help out the more ignorant among us","I like Tal Farlow, and Jody's a good instructor. He'll ask a question, which Tal will respond to using definitions that make sense to him and Jody, but left me scratching my head. And there is no book included so you can follow along. Occasionally Tal will show you a chord, but his giant hands hide that chord, a book would have really helped. And it could have added a few definitions. Was Tal talking about quartal harmony, he was saying something about 4ths? Based on that criticism I can't recommend this."
1,Poorly Structured Game,"This has got to be one of the worst games we have ever played with our son. The object of the game is to correctly answer a ""Worst Case Scenario"" by choosing a ""Tool Card"" from your hand (players are dealt five random tool cards at the beginning) and then explain why that tool is the one that would work in the scenario described. The problem is that there is only one right answer, and a player may not have the correct choice of tool cards in his/her hand, and therefore has no option of even answering correctly. It is quite possible that it is impossible to answer correctly. This is ridiculous -- how can you create a game where a player may have no choice but to answer incorrectly! This is particularly frustrating to a child. We have discarded our game -- we did not even want to give it away. Do yourself a favor and do not purchase this game."
2,batman review,"this is the first live action batman movie, filmed in 1943, during WWII. the main villian is a Japanese scientist. being the way that it was, there is alot of anti-japanese views displayed. not for the faint of heart or those suseptible to knee jerk reactions. the story is standard, the acting follows, but this being the first, it is a must have for true die hard batfans. i do not recommend young children watching this until they are old enough to understand that the predjudices in thes film should not be copied and they understand that during the war, feelings were heated. this is not the idea they should get of Batman at such a young age. Adam West is the impression they should have until their parents believe they are emotionally and mentally ready for this type of film. racism aside, the film is enjoyable."
2,Ego overpowers method,"Mr. Nishino's tremendous ego hampers the effectiveness of this book. If the reader can make it past the name-dropping, esoteric language, and unsubstantiated claims without becoming ill, he or she may find the breathing method beneficial. If you are looking for a clear, logical explanation of ki, this is NOT the book for you. A chore to read."
1,"Of six chapters, only one(5th)insinuates the method","In this book,KI is vaguely explained as the rest of it fails to explain in detail how to or why, I bought the book in Japan and for the amount of real information this book gives it might as well could have been written in 40 pages instead of 150 He also does`nt give the adress of his schools although this book seems to be propaganda for them."
1,Inhaling Vigorously,"As the title of this review states, it does. I was ripped off, plain and simple. The winds of prosperity were definitely against me when I purchased this book."
3,Too much dissertation-style survey of the literature,"I bought this book looking for some information on the economic policies of Hamilton and the early US republic. While the book does cover this issue, it is only tangential. Essentially, the book reads like Mr. McNamara's doctoral dissertation. The first two sections of the book review Adam Smith and his economic theories. The last section applies them (very briefly) to Hamilton and his ideas for the early financial organization of the US. That is really all that is here. There is no greater thesis at work; there is little synthesis that might make you see Smith, Hamilton or both in a new way. It would be unfair to say that this is a bad book, it just was not what I was looking for, and I am finding that there are better books on the subject of the initial economic policies of the new US nation, and Hamilton's influence on them."
2,disappointing to a hockey nut,"1st, this is both womens and mens hockey. It is devided nearly in half. While womens hockey is comming along, it cannot match the intensity or the excitment of the mens game which leads to the 2nd problem with this dvd. CBS apparently thought that since the US didnt win a medal, why really bother to do much with the DVD. With many other hockey video's even though we know the outcome the video's will atempt to build up tension and excitement. There is NONE here. It is a poorly conceived and put together DVD and no worth the price tag."
3,"Disappointing yes, but fun to watch!","I think this video didn't show enough about the US Women's team. Remind me, WHO won the gold? That's what I thought. The men's team was only good at trashing hotel rooms while the women went out there and played with their hearts. I would have preferred the whole video to be about the women's team. While I agree that the NHL is more exciting, it was the women who made the USA proud in Nagano."
3,acceptable,"the book is not so good, because some of its pages has been writen and the cover looks old"
1,Very Small,"It looks like it would hang on the side of the tank, but its way to small.The gap is almost gone after you add the hose to it, and even without the hoseit will not hang on the tank. I cant see any way to use this other then just putting the hose on anddropping it in the water. :("
1,Kutzall Dish Wheel,"I carve bowls from maple burl and ordered a Kutzall dish wheel to use in between Lancalot stock removal and the sanding process.Prior to the Kutzall, I used 24 or 36 grit disks. At first the Kutzall worked great. HOWEVER, after ten bowls the teeth on the Kutzall were worn flat and it is now useless."
4,"Nice Storage, But Not as Big as I thought","Dead-simple installation and clean look once installed. But if you have the Audiophile system (with the subwoofer under the back seat), then you have to get the space-eating sub enclosure that Du-Ha sells. Or have some shop custom-make you an enclosure. This eats half of the space."
5,Filled expectations,Easily put together. Looks great on the wall. Fits in the space we had. Quality as was depicted in ad.
4,Beginning Gardner,"I'd heard about Lasgna gardening from a friend. Purchased the book to follow it's direction. I had tried a modified method, and it worked. Wanted to do it this time around ""by the book"". Looking forward to even better results this year."
4,Lasagna! Garden?? what's up,"Very interesting. I have not PLUNGED in, but have definatley adopted some of the ideas presented. Pay attention to Tips and Time-Savers, lots of scrap factoids to be found"
5,Best Gardening book ever!,"I have owned this book for probably ten years and it has helped me so much. All the things that I have tried from her book have worked great. My dirt is super healthy, my garden grows like crazy. I would recommend this book to anyone who has had enough of weeding and digging and have lost the love of gardening or have never tried because it seems like too much work. It is written in an easy fun loving manner, that's one of the things I love about her, she's real. She tells great stories,and she keeps it simple. Wish she was my neighbor. Get the book if you if you are done digging."
2,Nothing new under the sun.,"Whatever you call it, lasagna gardening, sheet composting, plain old fashion mulching with organic material, it is all basically the same thing and has been around for a long time. I was surprised to see a whole BOOK on the subject since the concept can be explained in a few pages. And this book proves that to be true. Actual technique is covered in the space of a long magazine article.One can find more (and better) information on lasagna gardening on line, for free, just by doing a search.I enjoyed the section on herbs, but again, it was nothing that cannot be found on line.For inexperienced gardeners or people who do not have any other gardening reference books on hand it is a good book, but for an experienced gardener, it is just so much fluff."
5,Great Book - really works!,"I'm a new gardner; 65 years old, and not wanting to work really hard. I started with raised beds, some old leaves, grass clippings, top soil and nutrients. I planted 32 plants in two 4 x 4 beds in this layering of ingredients. It is so, so easy. And the best part is that the plants LOVE it. They are growing like crazy and all look really healthy and happy."
2,Different way to garden,"This book has a lot of good information and is great for someone living in the suburbs with a small gardening area. I have tried the techniques with great sucess, but it was a lot of work. I live in a rural area and have very large gardening plots so this was way too much work for me, but if you have just small areas, it's great. I did this a few years ago in 2 of my gardens and the soil there is now top notch, so it does work!"
5,fun and easy!!!,"I borrowed this book from a friend and fell in love with it! I have one on order. My family and I put in 2- 4 foot squares in less then 4 hrs. We even had it planted!! We all worked together and even my kids had fun doing this ""work"". They can't wait until I put in some more. I have been putting off, putting in a garden for 5 years now. I don't have a tiller, and our yard is nothing but rocks. It would have taken me weeks to get it ready. If you like gardening, but hate the work, this is the way to go!!!"
5,Lasagna Gardening,"A very interesting concept for making garden beds, especially when the soil won't cooperate! I'm anxious to get out there and try some of the suggestions the author has set forth.She is a very good writer, and it is a pleasure to read her book. I also like that she sprinkled some of her food recipes into her work. Very charming book."
2,Ok for newbies.,"Colorful and interesting if you are new to the idea. Better books for gardener looking for specifics on the subject. The Newbie will enjoy all the extra "" Little of this Little of that"" concept of gardening."
1,Disappointed,It was supposed to be in good condition and it wasn't! Pages 25 through 87 were missing.... I do not consider this in good condion. The condition should have been discribed as poor condition with missing pages. Very misleading!
1,Meatless Lasagna,"The theory and practice of building lasagna style garden beds is a and useful and powerful practice but is really just 'sheet composting'. It is explained in one chapter but the 'meat' of the system is revealed on just one page. I am not a beginner gardener and found other than the ""lasagna garden"" idea, there was really little new in this book for me. However, a beginner may find lots of good general info about raised beds, intensive planting and other misc hints."
5,A fun and effecitve way to garden.,"This gardening book is one of my favorites. It has revolutionized how I garden. I saved a tree in my yard by doing a ring of ""lasagna gardening"" around it. And its soo easy!! It works and the earthworms love it too. I hardly have any weeds where I have used this method, what weeds I do have are fun to pull. Last summer I grew a 65 pound pumpkin in a yard that been hardpan from years of no use. The winter before we put the cardboard down and layers of compost, viola! my plants loved it!I highly recommend this book."
2,The Title Is The Best Part,"There are so many great gardening books out there that it would be sad for a novice to waste their time on ""Lasagna"" gardening. It appears to me that publisher Rodale has shamelessly repackaged a minor composting variation into a whole book with only profits in mind. May I suggest The Vegetable Gardeners Bible by Ed Smith, Gardener's A-Z Guide by Tanya Denkla, Square Foot Gardening by Mel Bartolomew, or Four Season Harvest by Elliott Coleman."
5,Fishtown,"I enjoyed reading this book and learning about Fishtown. I think everyone wouldenjoy this book because it is about a real place in Leland, MI."
3,"Dull, but informative book","This book is dry reading. Of course it is an anthology, but still, just as I was getting into one person's posting, it would never quote the person again. I loved Nella Last's books that were written for the Mass Observation Project. Look them up and read them first before reading this one."
4,Excellent Book,"This was an excellent book. Both the material and presentation was very professional and would be great for both a classroom or independent study for the written exam.The only drawback and it was minor was that the coverage of the required FAR's was minimal, but since everyone buying this book should have a copy of the latest FAR/AIM, this should not be too bad."
5,Even better than expected!,"This book is worth it's price.Even though I've read the book several times, I keep reading it over and over. It's full of drawings, pictures, tips, and interesting facts.And It's very easy to find specific infomation you're looking for.If you're looking for the best private pilot theory book, this is the One."
3,learning preference,"Your learning preference is key to choosing this book. Depending on your age; if your looking for a high school or community college type text then this book is for you. If your an older pilot you may have a preference for a good index, succinct definitions then this is for you. Enjoy!"
4,Mailbox Review,"The mailbox is great and gets a lot of wonderful comments from neighbors. The only down side is that it is quite difficult to get the mail in and out of the box. THe package said that it is USPS rated, but I have to think our mail carrier is not too pleased that it's so much more work to get the mail in and out. I know it is at times a hassle for us to get the mail out."
1,You'd be better off with a box of crayons,"The 3d view is very limited, you can walk through but you can't tilt your viewing angle vertically. The objects are very basic and there isn't much of a selection. The ""12 powerfull programs in 1"" is rediculous. The plumbing ""program"" is just a few bathroom objects that you can place in your house. The electrical and HVAC are just like the plumbing. Autoframing is useless. If you decide to change something you can't drag a box around everything and update them all at once. Example: i wanted to change my wall hieght, i had to right click on every wall, select ""wall properties"" from the menu, and then highlight a box and change it. And i had to do that for every wall seperately. The lanscaping feature where it changines the plants to show how they will look in 5 years just scales up some flat images of the plants."
1,Not what I expected,This program is difficult to understand. It is not easy to use. If you make a mistake it is not easy to correct it. I did not like it at all and am taking it back to Office Depot. I should have read other reviews before I got it.
2,Not ready for prime-time,"Very, very limited. Decides arbitrarily to link walls together so that an interior wall becomes an exterior wall, and changing the interior back changes all the walls in the group. No way to break a wall once you've put a window or door in it unless you first remove the window or door. Selection of textures is very, very limited and there is no documented way to import more. Selection of objects the same--the 3d designer does allow new objects to be defined but compared to any kind of real 3-d CAD program, including the freeware version of Intellicad (no longer available alas), it's horribly weak, and no way to import from a real CAD program unless maybe you spring for one of the more expensive versions. No doorknobs. No way to specify where lights are located, at least none that I can find--there are lamp objects but they don't provide light, they just sit there.It's a cheap program that acts like a cheap program."
2,Difficult to use,"A couple of years ago I bought a similar product from Punch software and gave up on it after a few days of trying to figure out how to use it. (And I'm very technical and generally good with new software). I would not recommend this software unless you have hours to learn to use it properly.Google recently released a FREE home design software. Much like other Google products, this one is very easy to use - although not as powerful as one you might purchase. Before buying, I strongly recommend you check out Google's offering. Visit sketchup.google.com to take a look."
3,Design your home,"Application offers many features, however it must be studied to be used effectivily. Not for the impatient or get up and go user."
5,COOOL glasses,Love these glasses! They are way cool and prevent mixups as everyone has a different color. Price is great too.
1,not good,"These are NOT the original recordings, and are only a poor imitation. It turns out that each song has ""...at least one of the original Platters..."". Don't waste your money."
1,no titles or artist listed,unable to check for the artist or track names to see if i would like to purchase. big mistake!
5,I love it,"I had it installed and was using it in about 20 minutes. I put it on a Delta contractors saw so I didn't have to do any hole drilling or anything. I can't tell you how it compares to a Bessimeyer or anything, the only thing I'd ever used was the original round tube delta fence. This thing is worlds better and I haven't regretted my purchase one iota."
5,Delta 36-T30 T2 30 inch fence and rail system,"This fence and rail system is just what I hoped it would be. First off it is so nice to have a system that is very easy to adjust and set up. It is very nice to have a unit that does not have to be double checked with a tape for every cut.I mounted it on an old Ridgid contractors saw. The improvement is as if I have a brand new saw. My saw is a dream to use with the Delta 36 T30 T2 system, and much easier on the pocket book than the Biesemeyer unit.The materials and workmanship are superb in my opinion."
5,It got the job done!,"Having ""rescued"" a saw from being thrown away, this fixed the problem of no fence and gave a possible addition to the garbage dump a longer life. The fence is precise and well-made, and fit perfectly."
1,incomplete,"Package came with fence but no rails.....twice. I was told the rails were somewhere in the box???? Still waiting for the refund. Bought the whole system at Lowes for $20 cheaper. Rails were in that box. First time I have had a problem w/amazon, customer service is hard to deal with to be polite. Fence and rail system is great, but you need the rails, amazon needs to know what they are selling."
5,This is a great product.,"I love this new fence and rail system. The original fence that came with my 10"" Delta Contractor's saw had became difficult to adjust and would no longer self-align with the blade. This new fence slides smoothly on the tabletop and it's measuring gauge is pinpoint accurate. Installation was easy. It only took about an hour to put on. It would have probably taken less time than that had I not taken a Budweiser break. The maximum rip width of this fence is 31"" as opposed to the not quite 25"" for the original equipment fence. Also, should the Delta 36-T30 T2 30"" fence need to be removed from the tabletop for any reason it simply lifts off the rails and can be easily set aside. If a sacrificial wooden fence is needed (for making rabbit cuts and such), Rockler's offers a simple universal clamping system which attaches a board to the face of the fence. I just wish I hadn't waited so long to get rid of the old fence. I highly endorse this product."
4,Delta 36-T30 Fence and Rail System,"I own a 1950 Delta Unisaw which came with the Jet-Lock fence and rail system. I wanted to upgrade to a more precise fence and rail system but did not want to spend $300-$400 for a Beisemeyer. This is a great bang for the buck. It is extremely accurate and well manufactured. I would have given this product four stars if it weren't for this difficulty in mounting this to my Unisaw. I actually had to machine two special stepped spacers in order to mount the front rail to the table. I believe this is due to the ""old"" Unisaw table design where the holes in the front of the table are counterbored with a non-standard bolt hole and counter-bore size for use with the Jet-Lock 1-3/8"" diameter rails. This may not be the case for the newer Unisaws."
4,Great fence for the Money,As with many of the reviewers of this product I was considering the $400+ type of rip fence for my 10 yr old Craftsman contractor saw. I oppted for this one thinking if it didn't suit me I would just be out $200 and then go buy the more expensive one.I'm very pleased to say it was easily adapted to my saw and I love it. I have two cast aluminum table extensions on my saw with slotted holes that fit the front rail and I drilled 2 more holes in the edge of the cast iron saw table to match the center holes in the rail to make 4 total bolts for stability. An easy retrofit for a product was made to fit a Delta saw.
5,"Delta 36-T30 T2 30"" Fence and Rail System","Very nice fence system, well constructed, and fairly easy to install. I have a grizzly g1023 cabinet saw that I installed the fence on. I had to drill a couple holes in the rear rail to make it fit, which voids warranty, but considering how much I paid for the fence, and how much better my saw performs, I'm willing to sacrifice the warranty. It glides effortlessly, its easy to adjust, it stays parallel to the blade, it stays square to the table, and when locked down its very solid. If you don't want to spend $400 plus on a Biesemeyer fence, or $300 plus on a Shopfox or Vega, then this is the fence your looking for."
5,Excellent addition to anyone's daily quiet time,The One Year Book of Personal Prayer is an excellent addition to anyone's quiet time. It can also be used as a tool to refocus during the day or as a focus for a prayer group. I've greatly enjoyed learning from other believers especially those from long ago who had such cogent things to say about prayer or from what they said in prayer. My first copy of this book was from a used book sale. I use it every day and never tire of the treasures shared in it. I've since bought copies of this great little book for others to encourage them in their prayer life as well.
3,Not really impressed,Not really impressed might be my application but it did not cover as well as I would have liked . again it may be my application though.
1,Obvious Stuff,"The book is correct in almost everything it says. One problem, it is mostly obvious. Anyone with half a brain could come up with the ideas in the book.Thus, if you are not too good with tech and understanding it, then this is a great book for you 'cuz it is correct. But then, if you need the book, you probably shouldn't be in business anywhere near the decision-making level."
2,"Not Bad, Not Excellent","Saw this book in the bookstore the other day. Read the dust jacket. Looked pretty good, so I read the whole book. Just finished last night. Here are my two cents.I'd say the book is not bad but not excellent. Good content in some parts, hampered by poor writing. what can you expect from a tech guy 'come author i guess :)! book has got stuff that other books don't have, so it might be worth a perusal. But i agree with some of the other reviewers that the book is a bit boring. Coulda' used an good editing job."
1,OK,"Decent book. Like the other reviewers, I think the book has some merit from a content standpoint. The main problem is the writing is not very good. I might skim the book if I were you."
1,Terrible,"Uhhh, did any notice the internet bubble and the millions lost by over aggressive investment in useless technology? This Logan chap thinks companies should invest to stay ahead of the game because if they don't, technology is a tax.He thinks IT-business execs talking is going to solve everything when buying new it technology. gimme a break. this guy obviously has never worked in a big company.he is off in la la land thinking a CIO will buy tons of technology now with budgets low and his job on the line. la la land!!!!!!!!"
1,Not Impressed,"Arrived with finish flaws, and more were added in process of installing the product. The finish is extremely thin and soft."
4,One little problem,"This is a great calendar with many great photos. There is one little problem however. There is little to no space to write anything down on it. This makes a great calendar just to check the day but for anything else, it just makes a good looking poster book."
1,WORST BEATLES WALL CALENDER EVER,"The small photos are all in Black and White. A picture of the calender online shows a color photo, so I assumed the calender woulod be in color. There is no space in write in on the dates. The calender does not even show the year. I can't believe Apple would license this garbage. What a waste of money."
4,Let's Take the Kids to London,"If you plan to take children to London this is a great book. I warn you though if you get this and lots of other books you'll think this one too simplistic and put it aside. Don't. Its very straight forward and pragmatic approach is actually helpful if you read the narrative and don't just focus on the fact sheets. (The book has lots of ""fact sheets"" with basic details like hours, costs, location and how much time activities take.) I definitely agree with his choices of ""must dos"" and ""highlights"". I also appreciated his themes - like don't do in London what you can do at home and that children need to vary and pace actvities in ways very different than adults. We almost always took more time for each activity than he indicated. And of course some of the information is dated (for example most of the museums are free now.) Still, he has a wonderful feel for London and for what really catches a child's fancy."
2,Not much of a book,"A collection of peoples' success stories in maintaining some sort of amicable relationship post-divorce. While many of the stories are inspiring, the book is written in a hodge-podge fashion arranged around subject matter but sharing quotes from the same people over and over. I would have preferred chapter by chapter couple studies that went in depth into the various stages each couple went through as they dealt with their scenarios.Large print, small format, wide margins, large spacing try to mask that this book simply isn't very long. As another reviewer said, an ""easy read""; that's a nice way of putting it."
4,Red ryder blunders comedicalyly thru to Olde West,"Bright,fresh,fun time travel when desert motocross cyclist Fred Ward stumbles across a time experiment in a 'desolate' area and unknowingly continues his race thru the old West.Clever use of irony and time paradox that never gets in the way of the action.Also you may never look at a zipper the same way again.Deserves watching."
5,A no nonsense approach to Designed Experiments,"If you don't want to get your Ph.D. in statistics but you still want to benefit from the power of designed experiments then this book has it. The accompanying software ""DOE Keeping it simple statistically"" also makes learning easy and fun."
5,Blue Book of Effective Speech,"This is a self-help book for anyone interested in improving speaking skills. It is simple, friendly, and helpful, written to where you won't have to study hard to get it's meaning. Whatever it says, it says briefly,and every lesson is about a definate point.This book is divided into 7 books within...each book has a set of 16lessons. Perfect for teaching classes for any group. For instance:Book 1 - How to Talk Effectively in Daily Life (16 Lessons).Book 2 - How to Persuade People to do What you Wish (16 Lessons).Book 3 -How to Talk in Selling Goods (16 Lessons).Book 4 - How to Use the Voice Effectively (16 Lessons).Book 5 - How to Argue and Debate, Both Formally and Informally (16 Lessons).Book 6 - How to Speak in Public (16 Lessons).Book 7 -How to Speak in Accordance with Parliamentary Law. (16 Lessons)."
4,Sample Disc???,"This CD is just acting like ""Sample/Demo"" of the real FFX Disc, good for those who are short in budget. I miss few of good soundtracks like Tidus's theme, Spira, Via Purifico, etc. If you're really love FFX, try to buy the 4 CD OST."
3,Mostly mediocre,"I don't know why people keep saying this is the full soundtrack, because it's not. It is an abridged one-disc version released in the U.S. by TokyoPop. Read the product details, guys.Anyway, the soundtrack to FF10 is extremely mediocre. It's got one very beautiful track, ""Zanarkand"" (opening piano theme), which to me is worth the whole price of the CD. ""Suteki da ne"" (the game's theme song that plays during Tidus and Yuna's lovey-dovey underwater cutscene) is also nice, as is ""Ending Theme"" (which is, unsurprisingly, an orchestral variation of ""Zanarkand"").The rest of the tracks on the CD are nothing noteworthy. They are adequate in the game, but when you have to listen to them alone, they're not great; a few of them are annoying (like ""Final Battle""). Overall, the FF10 soundtrack doesn't hold a candle to FF7 or Kingdom Hearts II."
4,Might be pirated,When I recieved my copy of this I was excted but once I opened it I was confused weither it was legit or not. Some of the songs skipped and it got annoying after awhile even though the CD's weren't scratched. Over all it was nice that I got my music but....ehh....was it really worth it?
5,"""Prayer of the fayth""",I didn't even buy it yet but im about to and i know its 5 star material. Best since FFIV
2,Leaves a whole lot to be desired,"Less than adequate. You can learn a few things from this book, but the design really didn't offer me enough examples and applications of command syntax. Anyone who wants to see how this book should be written needs to take a look at the format offered in ""The Little Blue SAS Book"". I guess it spoiled me from any future computer user guides. In addition, the Syntax manual (PDF) that comes with SPSS offers a searchable guide that can give you everything this book offers in no time at all."
4,"Could be better, but best one for now","Good books on SPSS syntax are few and far between. This one is a really good resource, and is relatively user friendly. I think it's a reflection of the fact that SPSS is not designed as a syntax-based statistical package, unlike Stata and SAS. There simply aren't a lot of resources because it's not marketed/desired for its syntax. I use SPSS because I must - it's the standard at work. If you find yourself in the same situation, this book might be a worthwhile purchase. Otherwise, I'd say stick to Stata or SAS instead."
5,Fun and anxiety provoking!,I love this game! The monsters are scary and they really stress you out at times. The game is just right in terms of difficulty for me. I am relatively new to the whole video game thing. My favorite game is Parasite Eve II and this game is comparable to that in my opinion.
3,Extermination,"Good story line, alright graphics. I didn't like how you controlled the character much though, it would be better if the controls were like Red Faction. I got really sick of the same monsters all the time too but I liked how you would get infected if you couldn't kill them."
2,Quite dull,"Man I thought this game would be a whole lot more exciting! Through most of the game you fight stupid flukes-with-legs that you can pick off from across the room with no repercusions. The enemy AI is simply not smart enough to be called an AI. The controls remind me of Tomb Raider I. While that was a great game back in the day, we've suppossedly made great leaps in game controls since then. The story is kinda neato. I just wish there was at least some kind of multiplayer thing to do or some other game modes or something. Quite a disappointment."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!,How can they even dare compare to RE series...it's not even close. The camera angles when you enter an area force you to aim your weapon at something in order to see in front of you. The graphics for this PS2 game are worse than I've ever seen on any game on the old PS. I just purchased GT3 and now realize just what kind of graphics the PS2 is capable of and this game doesn't even come close...and don't get me started on the voice dubbing...
2,hmm,"Mutant Marines,virus spitting takpoles and Aliens interior decor all serve to tingle gamers spines in eztermination,but the real terror literally lies right under one's nose.Demon controls!These heinous torture tools will enrage Gahndi patient gamers.Try shooting down multi attacking bloodsuckers in third person with the behind the back camera view.Get used to getting mauled while being forced to stand still th shoot,and expect to kill mucho gaming sessions not infectoids with a completely ineffect oik auto aim.Still,the controls are atleast good for one thing:running something you will be doing a lot of to survive.TREADMILL SIMULATOR ANYONE?"
3,"Great, but not that great","When I first started playing the game, I thought it was terrible. The annoying camera angles, the voice dubbings, the average graphics. I was wondering while I was playing this whether I should take it back to the store or not because it was so boring. All you do is kill these little tiny aliens, and that gets old fast. I had to force myself to like this game. And, I realized as I went through the game, it became more interesting and exciting. The story got better, and the action got better. When playing this for the first time: just stick it out, it will get better. This is the kind of game when you beat it, you never want to play it again. I wish that I would have rented it because it wasn't worth the ... bucks for me. It's no Resident Evil, that's for sure."
1,Camera Angles + Controls = Stupid,"If you like suicide, this is your game.The camera angles combined with horrible controls lead to this game becoming work.The character can do incredible things when the action button is pressed at the right instant... or he can take a swan dive off a ledge into death because of a bad camera angle or lacking hair-pin timing.Resident Evil overcomes this by giving characters a basic ability to recognize a death maneuver or having auto-aim actually mean auto-aim.This game is a laborious bore and is now promptly for sale."
5,"Extermination, not Resident Evil","I just played Extermination and RE3: Nemesis, I think that they are the same genre but not comparable games. Extermination may have you killing a lot of bugs at first, but about an hour in; the game gets better. At first, I'd rate it with a four. However, playing on, I thought that the second portion of the game made up for the first part. Just before wasting bugs gets seriously annoying and routine, more kinds of enemies appear. Weapons were customizable, so there were different situations that different weapons would solve the problem. Extermination really needs a good sequel by the same group, they know what it takes to make a great game."
4,cool but not the best i have played,Okay I don't have the real game(just the demo)but from what I have played this game rocks! There are a couple downsides though. For example: when you have to kill the enemies(they look like mutated bugs)its kind of hard because you have to hold down a button. When you do that the aiming's hard. And you have to shoot very quickly or the bug things will infect you with what I think is poison. Another thing is that its one of those games where they dont tell you anything so you have to go back and forth. This game is also difficult cause there are huge rooms with lots of doors. It takes awhile to go through every door to find something (half the time you dont know what). But its still a very fun game. In my opinion you should rent it first or you could buy a game you hate (if you dont like these kind of games). All in all I like this game and hope to some time get it for PS2.
5,awsom game,this game is an awsome rbg . u are a marine sent into a site that has ben taken over by infectious bug monsters. this game is hard however and should not be played by children under at least 10 years old because of its violent content. it is rated m for mature.
4,Good survival horror,"It's a short game and the voice acting is not that great, other than that I was surprised by the gameplay. You can crawl, jump and shimmy like a tomb raider game with a go anywhere camera. I call it a resident evil clone with good controls. Monsters are convincing and battles challenging.You have one gun which you attach add-ons.Surprised this one didn't get much attention. I expected a mediocre game but it's actually quite good."
3,Good game. Bad production.,"Extermination is one of my 'go to' horror adventure games. The story and location is good, controls are good, and replayability is high. I particularly like how the environment changes as the game progresses. The downside is the laughable dialogue and horrible delay with the sound during the story portions. It's pathetic production.By now the price should be low, so it's an excellent game to grab for those of us still hanging on to our PS2."
2,I've only played the demo.,"I've been a fan of the survival-horror games since the first resident evil, and i'm a big fan of the series. Extermination clearly doesn't cut it compaired to R.E. or silent hill 2. I found the in-game menus annoying, and the enemies bothersome at best. the graphics were fine, although nothing spectacular. I didn't play enough of it to say how well the plot develops, but it seemed pretty cliched to begin with. If you're looking for a good survival-horror game for the ps2, go with R.E.: code veronica, or silent hill 2 if you really want to be scared. If you've already tried those, you'll just have to wait for ""the thing"", which might prove to be the most innovative survival-horror game since the original R.E."
3,"Do you like Resident Evil, youll like this!",When i started playing this game it was fun. After a while i got hard and boring cause it wasnt my taste of game. But if u like R.E. you'll like this!
2,Disappointing,"I rented this game hoping that it would be somewhat comparable to Resident Evil. Unfortunately, it is not even close. The action is very limited, most of the time you are just shooting little goober looking creatures. The voice dubbing is awful. Worse than an early Godzilla movie. The biggest problem is that the angle views are very, very akward. You walk into a room, and you still have a top view, so you cannot even see what is in front of you. I gave the game 2 stars, because some of the movie sequences are ok."
1,Complete Garbage!,The cars wont stay on the track even if you're running them slow on a flat surface. Each car handles differently and are completely inconsistent. Controllers don't respond well and get stuck. Toys from China are getting worse and worse as quality is continually being sacrificed for a greater profit. I'm going to stick with buying toys from American toy makers from now on even though it will be limited to less high tech toys.
3,Jon Otis or Johnnie O,"Released in 1997, this album by singer Jon Pickering contained remakes as well as original compositions. Good album if your really into Euro-disco artist like Nicki French as there are similar styles to her take on Total Eclipse Of The Heart in many of the songs."
4,An Interesting Look at the Work of a Master,"Davis was one of the top players in Chicago blues during the 30s and 40s. He was one of the Bluebird house musicians and backed people like Tampa Red, Big Bill, and Sonny Boy Williamson I.This album is a live recording that shows off his powerful left hand and delicate right hand. It doesn't have any examples of the standards he loved to play but it shows his considerable ability in the barrelhouse style.It's a good introduction to the work of a forgotten master of the blues."
1,very bad,"usualy ,cafe l'apres midi is good signature , but this is really bad.asmatic voice , elevator arrangements ,although some of the songs are classics.go and buy the originals."
3,Not my kind of homeschooling,"The author and photographer do a good job of capturingAllison's day in a warm and human way. However, I would not recommendthis book as an introduction to homeschooling because I have philosophical disagreements with the approach Allison's parents use. The family uses a ""school at home"" approach complete with tedious homework, regular testing, and pressure to work. The parents stay up late into the night developing lessons, planning curriculum, and assessing their daughters' progress. And the mother has a masters degree in education! While that's not a bad thing, overall this book could give the impression that homeschooling can only work for highly educated superparents. I prefer I am a Home Schooler by Julie Voetberg which to me sets a more appealing and approachable example of homeschooling."
1,Did not work,Kodak Advantix C750 APS Date CameraIt did not work. Sent it back. Will try another one.
1,DON'T READ!!!!! BAD INFO!!!!!!!!!,"I just want to say that i love 98 Degrees!!!! I love their music, their looks, and their down to earth attitudes. So don't get me wrong when i say i don't like this book. It has nothing to do with them. The one who wrote this book can't even get their names right. She keeps on calling Jeff....Jeff Lachey. If you are going to write a book about someone you should at least get their names right. Plus it was so chessy. One part is like Nick is sad....Nick is lonely.....He is wearing only his boxers and his tattoos. He has tons of girls numbers but no true love. He wonders if there is any yoo-hoo in the fridge. It gets annoying. Plus when she talks about the songs she gets the parts wrong of who sings what. I know everyone may not know everything about 98 but if you are going to write a book about them you should get your facts straight. Anyone go get their offical book when it comes out. Don't waste your time or money with this one!"
2,BAD BOOK!,"Don't get me wrong, I love 98 Degrees and I love reading about them, but this author couldn't get anything right. It's good to add to a collection, but not to read. Drew doesn't start off in Dreaming and Jeff doesn't start off in Heaven's Missing An Angel. All throughout the book she kept calling Jeff, Jeff Lachey, and she said Jeff gathered his 3 friends, Nick, Jeff, And Drew to form a group. That's not at all how it happens!"
3,It was pretty good but could be better.,I thought the book was worth it just to add to my collection. There are a number of errors in the book and it was based on information off the internet. The pictures are the best part of the book.
2,Several wrong facts,"This book has several wrong facts about 98 degrees, and lots of typo's. It does however have a couple of good pictures of the guys. If you are a big 98 Degrees fan, you might want the book just to add to your collection of 98 Degrees stuff."
2,Astronomical Letdown,"There are only 2 decent tales in this anthology: ""Star"" and ""A Billion of Them"". I am photocopying those stories and then selling the book. What a colossally boring, uninspiring, unengaging collection. Peter Crowther, in the future, make sure that the stories in your collection GO somewhere significant..."
4,"Passionate, and filled with raw emotion.","This collection of poems will have you laughing through your tears,and remembering joy even when theres pain. His book show he's a hopeless romantic, full of love,pain, unsecurity, aggressivness, intelligence,and positivity. But don't take my word for it go SEE for yourself."
1,Test Has Changed,"I am a controller and I know several people who have taken the test recently. There is no study guide available that will help you on the ATSAT. I would suggest setting up several computers and playing games such as 3-D blocks, Rat Poker, etc all at the same time."
2,Not very happy,"I agree with the other reviewer that this book has topics that tend to repeat. Also, I took the practice test and was very disappointed. Many questions weren't covered in the text and I couldn't even take a guess. For example: test question asked the # of chromosomes in a cell, no where in the text does it ever review that. I could go on and on with other items. Also I found many of the topics not clearly defined and had to google to get a better understanding. Then there were topics like inductive method that had 6 paragraphs of explanation and one paragraph for deductive method. Many topics were overly wordy and I think the author sometimes forgets who the audience is, some of us aren't scholars."
2,dont buy the book,"Honestly, I studied this book and there was hardly anything on the test from the book. It was a waste of money and the book's 2 practice test had almost the same questions. Oh, and what do u know... I failed. So try another book!"
2,Mediocre at best...,"Overall, sloppily put together. I found the book to have many errors... in the prac. test answer guide, for example, one explanation refers to the right answer but the letter choice is listed incorrectly. There are typos throughout the book. Information is repeated, word for word, in different sections, probably so you can review each section independently of the others, but still, it's a lot of ""filler"". Many practice test questions were not covered in the review material, which makes no sense for a comprehensive review guide. Reviewing the practice test answers using the CD software was a bit cumbersome. I haven't taken the exam yet, but after using this book, I'll definitely NOT rely on it as my only prep source. There are too many comments in other reviews about inconsistencies between the guide material and the actual test material. I can't imagine giving this guide 5 stars unless I was related to the author. ;)"
2,Questionable Answers,"I bought this for my husband to review for the test, however, when we studied it, there appear to be several errors. I'm a teacher myself..and, mind you, I didn't have time to look up the answer to be sure I was correct, so I can't give examples. Just check when it sounds wrong .. if you have time.It's better than nothing!"
1,AWFUL,"This book was really no help. I am a career changer so some of the info was interesting but the when I came to the actual test I was SO LOST. It didn't have much that was in that book. I failed by 4 points. I honestly, think I could have done just as well without the book. Waste of money."
2,Not very helpful,"This book is awful. There are no practice questions throughout and there are many errors. How can one refresh their memory with math when there are just paragraphs written about HOW to do things instead of actual problems to practice??? It's frustrating to even go through this book. The worst part about it is there is no better book for this test!!! Cliffs Prep needs to create a book for this test, their study guides are awesome!"
2,Not what you think,"I purchased this book somewhere else and to be fair I have not taken the test yet. This book is filled with typos and in certain circumstances it keeps repeating itself. At first I thought it was to reiterate important information that needed to be remembered, now I feel it was soley to lengthen the book. There are many areas that are so detailed about unnecessary infomation that it side tracks you from the important stuff. It does follow all the competencies as it is on the study guide provided by the state. Okay, here is my biggest problem! After taking the sample tests, which I did horrible on, I went back to see where I neglected this info in the chapters...well it is not there!! The sample tests ask you questions that were not covered NOR mentioned in the book. Frustrating!!! Beware!"
3,It's pretty good.,"It's o.k. as far as comedy CD's go, but it could be better. I was a little disappointed."
1,pass this one up,Very disappointing book. At almost $1/page this book is a joke. It is a very basic guide to a very detailed subject and I didn't learn anything new after reading it. The print is so large that it's obvious that the editor/author were trying hard to add volumne to make up for content. I've never seen a technical book with print so large my grandmother could read it without her glasses.
3,So-so,"I thought the second part was too repetitive, and the third part doesn't seem to deliver the promised advice. It does get you thinking about how desires work though. Kenneth Kloby."
2,Might be a good book if you like self help books,A good portion of the book is stoicism history. The rest is self help on the uselessness of certain desires. Not rocket science; not very brillant
5,Must have!,"I love this book. It is well written. And as a non-English speaker, I find it easy to read and understand. This book is a must have for everyone who like to argue about life. As a Buddhist, the book talks about the core of the believe. It helps in understanding more of what desire really means. It is one of the great book that I have read about mind-over-body things. It is absolutely ""must read"" for Buddhist!"
4,Pedagogic but persuasive,"I say ""pedagogic"" because, as a former philosophy student, I can see where some of this might have come fairly directly from lectures. And I did find some of it slow-going at times, although the careful building of his arguments was persuasive. What lead me to read the book was a radio interview in which Irvine said that the Stoics were not drab, glum folk as are often assumed - they knew how to enjoy life and were particularly good at making the best of any situation. I have found Irvine's final thoughts valuable, although this is not, as he says, a self-help manual. Yet now, when I feel a desire, I remind myself that desires are not designed to lead us to happiness, and try to judge how much my life would be better - how much happier I would be, if at all - if I got what I desire. That's not an easy exercise. You can read more on that in the New York Times Magazine article, ""The Futile Pursuit of Happiness, "" published on September 7, 2003."
4,I want...you to read this book.,"More people should. I majored in biology so I already knew the basis for most of his arguments (re: evolutionary programming), but reading it in all the different contexts (religious, philosophical, etc.) was to view the ways we try to adapt and understand our wants in a singular or communal setting (have a new respect for the Amish and Mennonites!).A portion that really stuck with me though was in discovering that our brain knows what we want before our conscious actually does -- much to chew on in that section.Live your life by controlling your desires, don't let them control you is essentially what I took away from the vast landscape he manages to cover in this little book. Read it and see what message you come back with."
4,A journey into desire,"On Desire is a fascinating book that looks at how we interact with desire. The author comes off as a little prudish, advocating more of an approach of ignoring desires, but even with that tone, the book provides a look at what desire is, what the neurological basis of it is, as well as how different cultures and communities deal with desire. I would have liked to have seen exercises in this book from the author. It is more of a philosophical treatise than anything else, but still worth a read."
3,Disappointed,"I owned several memory-, CD-, and HD-based MP3/WMAplayers and honestly I don't know why I get this Muvo2 player. There are simply too many thing that I don't like about this player1. The control is way too small (less than 1/2"" in diameter with 5 functions)2. The navigation sucks -a. You can't choose a song directly w/o playing a folder and then advance to the song you want.b. You can't back out of a folder w/o going through menu | folder option | 1st folder | next/prev folder...c. Only 2/3 functions of the tiny control wheel is available for navigation.3. They want you to buy additional battery for $50 instead of using standard batteries.4. The control wheel and play buttons are completely hidden when the unit is in the case so you have to take the unit out before you can control it.5. The USB 2.0 and USB charging support are nice. However, you can't use the player in the USB charging mode."
4,its our first,"I picked this for no moving parts, and easy interface with windows XP. So far, So Good, we use it while out on the ATV's. Ease of use for us is just fine, yea, wish it had more memory, Yea, regular batteries would be nice, but ease of getting MP3's onto it is great, hit play, and enjoy...."
5,Muvo2 X-Trainer 512Mb,"Overall opinion:Would I buy it again? Definitely! Fantastic little player. Best solid state on the market currently.Pros:Great clarity, good solid feel, fantastic design (clean and simple), Excellent capacity options considering other players on the market average around 64-256mb), solid state memory definitely a plus. Can recharge through USB or DC adaptor. USB2.0 for fast transfers. Backlighting good idea. Fast playing/startup. Good volume (with earphones).Cons:Buttons a bit small - can be difficult to operate when exercising. While sound clarity is fantastic, bass is lacking a little. LCD display is really cool, but maybe not 'glance' friendly. Belt-clip accessory is a bit cheap and plastically (wheres the nice leather/vinyl pouch? or at least they could colour code it?) but ultimately very functional and robust. They dont sell it in Australia yet! (took me a month to order from U.S)."
1,Buy an iPod,Why waste your money on this product when you can pay $30 more and get a 10GB iPod? It holds 20 times the amount of music!!! The price of the MuVo is RIDICULOUSLY high!!
1,this is pathetic!,this is the most stupid game i have ever played. at the start of an exhibition game the color comentator always says i think this is going to be a low scoring game. the peoples head's are huge and the move so slow. even mike vick is slow. the qb chalange is so hard ive never one. if i could rate this 0 stars i would.
4,Good but not great.,When i first got this game i thought it would be really fun.When i played it i got two touchdowns with the same play i did two plays in a row. I killed them 63-0. this game is really easy and if you like easy games than pick this one.
1,"don't buy it, dont rent it.","this game is horrible.Pros:NoneCons:horrible gameplay and junky graphics.players heads are huge.freezes all the time.commentary is so anoying and repeats its self all the time. Like in the begining of an exhibithion game the color commentator always says "" i think this is gona be a low scoring game."" don't waste your money on this horrible game."
3,O.k. but not the best.,"This game is not Madden 2002, but it does have its moments. It does continue the QBC series of which I liked 99, and thought 2001 was a decent game. Running the offense is fine, but the defense is horrible (both your team and the computer). I had a hard time stopping the Bears with the Ravens defense for example. The extra quarterback club challege game is a fun diversion. If you liked prior QBC's check out this game, otherwise try Madden or Sega's 2k2."
2,QB CLUB IS A DISAPPOINTMENT,"This game does not have slow downs,its kinda slow when you first hike the ball,then all of a sudden the game moves real fast,thats bad,this game does not have wu-tang,i know they wish they did,cuz this game plain out blows,you can run over the refs on qb club,WOW,i think thats only when you the qb and you run back to do that,the qb chalenge is kinda kool but gets boring really fast"
3,A real review.,"[...]Qb Club is sorta bad,the game is not all bad,i say rent first,the game seem kinda slow.but the controls are indeed easier,on qb club 2001 it was hard to run the ball on the 64 version,but this one i can break a 80 yarder on this game,the Graphics are kinda good upclose,but when you are playing the game kinda looks like a madden on sega Genesis.The Qb challenge is cool,the longest throw,hitting the bulleyes with a pass,the controls are the same as gameday,i give it 3 stars"
2,(...),"Nfl QB club has one of the best options, which is to be able to play in the QB challenge but once your in the game you notice that the good times stop there the game is no where near MAdden 2002 .....I think this QB will stick to the EA giant"
3,Qb Club 2002 is good,"QB club is cool.good sound.you can run over the refs on this game,qb challenge is cool.its easy to sack the qb on here.but it falls short to madden 2002.madden got where you can challenge the play on qb club nope.but its tight."
4,"Fun game, you have to be quick",My 7 year old daughter got this for Christmas and we have a lot of fun playing it with her. There are 2 ways to play it which is nice. You have to be quick but it can be very easy to be fooled by the cards. You won't be disappointed.
2,NOT a great game,"This is NOT a great game. Let me start by saying that we are huge fans of Blue Orange games. This one, however, disappoints. The monkeys are difficult to distinguish from each other and quite frankly, I felt like we were all coming up in a ""tie"" when matches appeared. I think my kids enjoyed it for the mere fact that you are supposed to make funny monkey sounds & movements. If you are looking for a more fun card game with the same fast paced challenge of slapping cards, try Slamwich - it involves a little more thinking, yet the cards are easier to distinguish from each other, resulting in a more fun & fair game. As I said, we are big Blue Orange fans, so let me now go and give raving reviews to our favorites: Yamslam, Golden Gate, SpotIt, Gobblet (Gobblers). Check those out for some great family fun!"
1,Mucho Ripoff,"I had high hopes when I ordered this toy. Know that it is NOT a backpack. The one handle on the top is the only way to carry it.The stuff inside is nothing special... stickers, crayons and cardboard pieces. We were very disappointed. Dora fans deserve better."
4,Felt like I was right there!!!,"As I began reading this book and absorbed Sophie Dunbar's fantastic descriptive narrative, I was gently transported to N.O. and the ""old-new"" South. I felt I could smell the smells, and hear the deep-Louisiana 'accents'. The mystery itself definitely kept me guessing. ""Oh he did it! No, she did it! No, they did it!?!?!?!?!??"" The type of book you want to sit down and read straight through. Thoroughly enjoyable!"
4,A blushing mystery,"Claire and Dan are a couple who will grow on you. Their affection, love and loyalty for each other will be tested more than once in this introductory title of the Eclair mystery series.Claire knows she loves him and thought he loved her, so why did she find him and a lively large breasted goddess nude under the moonlight? ...It takes humor and intelligence to solve this crime and survive this relationship... so the question is will they?The first couple of chapters will introduce you to Claire, Dan, their family and friends. Stay with it and you will learn much more about them then you expect. The mystery has enough twists and turns to keep you guessing and the backdrop of the beauty shop is unique.This mystery not only provides us with a mystery, but also with enough sexual tension to make one blush."
3,More like a romance novel than a mystery,"I love books that are set in New Orleans, but even that didn't overcome the disappointment with this ""mystery"" novel. The mystery was pretty thin and fairly easy to figure out. It's actually a romance novel with all the required elements: physically perfect leading characters, a love affair with lots of delicately written sex scenes and the standard class difference between the poor heroine and rich hero.While it was fun to read, I don't really like romance novels and the mystery left a lot to be desired. By the end of the book, I had already decided I didn't want to read any more of the series."
4,Isn't it wonderful?,"To many, buying a Japanese CD may seem strange, foreign and just plain odd.But with Rikki's childlike voice and amazing arrangement of instruments, falling into the music is as natural as breathing.I suggest those who are interested in Asian cultures and music, give this CD a chance, for those who are not, I hope you find something to match your taste."
3,Good book but could have done with more action.,"Good book but could have done with more action,perhaps it's the start of e series and so has a lot of exposition."
2,I really wanted to like this...,"In the light of day, this is just more trouble than it is worth. Frankly, the valve is just about worthless and the container is an extra piece. If you can find some small diameter silicone tubing and an angled tee, you can effectively make your own frothing system (and a far more versatile one, at that) for a few bucks. Save your money. Take some measurements and go to Tap plastics and talk to the nice people behind the counter. If they don't have what you need, maybe Amazon stocks your parts."
5,already had it,"i bought this book, but got and realized that I already had it-the cover was just a different color."
5,Outstanding...,Use this jam with cream cheese and spread on Wholefoods Everything Flatbread crackers....great appetizer.
5,THE VERY BEST PEPPER JAM AROUND!,"I was so happy to find this jam available on Amazon at a lower price than what I normally pay! I used to drive hours to visit my daughter in the Sierra Mts. and purchase from a winery where she works. It is best poured over cream cheese with bread, crackers, bagels or warm muffins. Any way you eat it this jam is a special treat. I've served to guests and everyone goes wild over it. Order in quantity --you won't want to run out!"
1,looks fun but isn't,maybe if it would even work on one of the 4 computers in our house it'd be fine. but it doesn't along with the fact that the 1st one we got that didn't work got taken back and we got a new one but it still doesn't work. The screen is blue and I've download the patch a zillion times. don't buy this as a gift because it's not reliable. It might not work.
5,Awesome and Uplifting!!,"Ms. Lyons has written a sensational book that will inspire and uplift all readers regardless of age, gender or ethnicity."
5,A Masterpiece,"Stunning . . . An incredible journey, both inward and outward.No one can write like Kathie FitzPatrick. The Peacemaker is one of the most unflinching and emotionally honest books I've read in a long time. It is about bravery and hope. It is unforgettable. It's a must read!"
4,Good simple real life example,It is a good book for beginner as well as people who have some accounting background. The book provides simple real life example that is easy to understand.
4,A comprehensive collection of famous quotations,"I am a writer, and this book has saved me on many an occasion. The quotations included cover a broad spectrum of categories- struggle, identity, self-reliance, challenge, love, etc.- and eras. Handy size makes it ideal for carrying. The only thing I don't like is that the quotations are accompanied by a name only. While it is easy to identify names like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X, others are more obscure and because I am not entirely familiar with African-American history, it leads me to wonder who some of these people are. Otherwise, a great reference tool and kudos to Ms. Bell for putting together such a handy book!"
3,snap 'n style doll,"The doll is well constructed and cute in appearance. It is better for the older child though, maybe a 4 or 5 year old. The clothes are rather hard to ""snap"" on at times and my 2 1/2 year old is upset that the clothing does not cover the doll's backside, though the doll does have a swimsuit type undergarment to cover the behind."
2,Nice but.....,"Beautiful boot, but the toe part is too curved upwards, makes me feel like I'm wearing ""Alladin shoes"", you know, the Arabian style.The boot would do much better if it lied flat at the sole instead of the curved toe.......very well made though. I did return it, wasn't a style I would wear, if it comes out with a flat toe, I will buy them again."
2,Not that bad but...,"This came wrapped beautifully, and the bracelet was as described, but not in the best quality I was expecting. The photo of the bracelet itself was definitely prettier than the product I received."
1,Bad Review!,"I bought this product for my mom for Christmas based off of what the reviews said and by the product description I am completely dissatisfied, after wearing the bracelet twice my moms wrist turned green! And not only did it turn green but the back of the bracelet is now completely brown/copper colored! I would not buy this product I was mis-led about the product and I am very upset because it's not worth anything. The only reason it has one star is because I can't give anything less!"
5,A nice gift.,"This was a great birthday present for my mom. She loves jewelry and this bracelet is just so cute! It's very sparkly and sweet. And it's a bonus that it comes in such a pretty box. It was a great last-minute gift for my mom for her birthday. And a good cheap one too because I am a poor college student and I can't afford to get her much right now. For what it is, it is very nice and I recommend it to anyone looking to get their mom a nice gift when they are hard on cash."
4,Mom just loved it !!!,"the pic doesn't do it justice !The crystals sparkle so much more when she put it on !I charged the crystals to bring her joy and comfort.After Mom passed I began wearing the bracelet.Took a shower with it on to clean it, next morningI noticed a ""ring"" of green on my arm !!!Sterling silver, I wonder !"
1,Came Broken!,"The bracelet is nice, I gave it to my wife for Christmas. She opens the box, and the bracelet was broken, not cool! Thank goodness for the easy Amazon return policy."
1,Terrible Quality,"this gun is terrible quality. i bought it a week ago and have fired a total of 40 shots. the gun has repeatedly jammed, constantly needs to be adjusted and lubricated, and really doesnt fire that hard. this gun is not worth the effort."
3,Outstanding concert.....with contemptible production!!,"If the concert was the only thing to review on this DVD, there would without question be a lot more 5 star reviews here. What a treat to watch the band, particularly Steve of course, and hear such great live versions of these songs. Trouble is, the concert is buried alive under virtually constant, awful special effects and absolutely appalling editing. It made me feel like I was watching 2 DVDs at once. What the production team did to this wonderful concert footage is criminal.This same concert needs to be re-released by a company who understands the point of watching a concert DVD."
3,Great Sounds / Horrible Video / CD links to Sony Web Site,"The music is fantastic, but as others point out, Glad is interrupted mid-jam, and there are a lot of teases of songs that we don't get to see. The bizzare editing reminds me of what I used to do with my dad's Super-8 when I was 13. The ridiculous cutaway scenes and pointless superimposition of random objects into the concert footage ruin this production. The video director would do well to watch a Norah Jones concert DVD to get an idea of what people who are buying concert footage are looking for.The music on the bonus CD is nothing special, and CDExtra doesn't work, but it does take you to Sony's web site. If you trust them after the rootkit fiasco then go ahead and try it.Get this DVD only if you must have everything Traffic ever put out. Otherwise, I suggest you buy the double CD for the excellent music, and leave this low quality DVD on the shelf."
1,Pure Nonsense,"The liner notes give no clue as to how unwatchable this is. Not one camera angle holds for more than 2 or 3 seconds, just when you think you can see something it changes to a different angle or to black and white or to some unknown person roller skating. As a result you don't ever see the concert, you can hear it but don't try to watch it, you will go blind and get a migraine; I am taking this piece of junk back to the mall and getting my money back, this is a complete waste and a ripoff and a huge disappointment"
3,Capaldi Tribute/Unpolished Winwood product,"Two things stand out while watching this DVD. One, It is a labor of Love to honor the late Jim Capaldi. Two, it is a raw look at the traffic reunuion tour of 1994 which is surprising because anything Steve Winwood has done in his career has been polished. He is a perfectionist. For those who say he is an ""egomaniac"" they do not see the big picture here."
3,"Great music, HORRIBLE STUPID effects/editing/etc","As much as I love Traffic's tunes, the IDIOTIC cutaway's, graphics, 60's psychedelic graphics, etc., etc., etc., almost completely detracts from concert footage. I totally agree with the other reviews that echo the same sentiment.Geeeeeeez, I bought this DVD spur-of-the-moment and hoped to see a great band performing (heck Gerry Garcia on Low Spark was a nice touch !). I prefer to see a concert straight-up, not dumb crowd shots and other crud, who cares about that ? Arrrrrggghhhh."
4,Must Have,If you like traffic and you like history then you have to get this. Winwood and Capaldi together (can't happen any more). Randall Bramlet takes Chris Woods role and a great choice. Yeah all those reviews cut down the director with the shots away from the band but what the hell. I was pleased.
5,Good DVD? Not for me...a gift,I bought this for a present so I have no idea whether it is a good DVD or not. As long as he likes it...all is good with me. The shipping and packaging were good and came as promised...what more can you ask for?
2,"Too brief, and a bit thin..","Brian Aldiss's second sci-fi work, ""Vanguard from Alpha"" does have a few things going for it. Written before man landed on the moon, it has aliens from Alpha Centuri that look like Malaysians. They have a hotter body temperature than humans, but they look very human. This takes place about 400 years from now, as the humans on Earth have grown very suspictious of these aliens called Tosks. A spy expedition is set up, and it goes horribly wrong. Then the hero has to figure out what really happened. There's danger at every turn, but unfortunely this book is far too short. It has only 108 pages."
3,review,basically works as advertised...doesn't seem to have made much of a difference though in flowthru capability from not having it
5,Bought this FIVE years ago and had ZERO problems,"I was just recommending a USB hub to a friend and thought I would look mine up to see if it is still being sold. It is! I purchased this hub 5 1/2 years ago and I have had it plugged in and on 24/7 ever since. I have had zero problems with it and all the ports work perfectly. This is a great workhorse of a USB hub. It sits on my desk at work and is plugged into my MacBook Pro right now. I have two USB drives and a USB monitor plugged into it constantly. I also regularly use it for my iPhone, Kindle, and other various USB items. Never had a single issue. Flawless product with incredible durability! If you need a USB hub, THIS IS THE ONE TO GET!"
2,Works well after 3 months,"This is a powered 7 port hub. It runs cool and seems to provide sufficient power for the operation of several devices (hard drives) simultaneously. The speed of transfer is sufficient.The CyberPower hub is a step up from other powered hubs both in solid craftsmanship and capabilities.If this review was helpful, please add your vote.________________________The hub has connections that are difficult to reach and a hummingbird-like cord connection that became easily bent. After 5 months use, it became impossible to insert the cord connection into the hub connection. Also, not all of the ports in the hub provided sufficient power."
3,Has some quirks,"I purchased this device as a U 2.0 USB hub. When it works, it is great......but I have to reinstall, sporadically, a specific driver on occasion for the hub to function. I give it only 3 stars for that."
2,CyberPower Hub does not recharge my iPod device,"The hub works well for my usb devices. Unfortunately, my iPod gives a warning message that, ""charging is not supported by this device."" One of my tasks intended for this device is to allow me to sync and charge my iPod. Anyone else have this issue?"
5,Nice unit,"I plug about 5 devices into this hub, and have never had a problem. I also plugged a small indoor helicopter into the hub to charge the battery. The main con I have is that you can't secure this unit to a surface. I'd like to have seen a mounting hole somewhere to stabilize it when plugging in all those USB cables. I've had it over a year with no issues."
4,So Simple So Easy,"Well, I purchased it after reading and watching the video on line here, Great Video.Super easy unit, plug it in and it loaded and installed all the items I plugged into it. Thats It !~ I purchased it to see if the power of the USB would be greater then the standard USB on the computer. No sure, This is the reason, I have Magic Jack as my home phone system now, 20 bucks a year ! All calls free. All my phones are powered phones except two of them, So I wanted to see if the power out of the USB stack would provide more power to ring the two standard phones I have. No luck. Ones only 25 ft away from the computer and the other is out in the shed, 125 ft away. They both do a weak ding when the phones ring, I'll live with it. Otherwise I give it 10 of 10. Any questions about the magic Jack, feel free to ask me."
2,Mediocre USB Hub,"This USB hub has turned out to not be so great. For one thing, it is the lower speed 1.1 not a 2.0 port hub. The reason I got this was that I bought a newer Logitech camera that takes more power than the previous one I had plugged in. When I plugged the new camera into the hub, the sound worked, the camera did not. Ok, I'll plug the hub into a port that I know was plenty of power when the camera is plugged into that port. Again, the same thing. Wait a minute... this port is fine with the camera plugged in directly but not with a POWERED hub in the same port with nothing else plugged in? Bring leash and take this dog away. It is no better, in fact worse than not being powered at all. In all fairness, other USB devices work fine as long as you don't mind going with the older, slower 1.1 USB, though it claims 2.0. I would not have bought it had I known, and would strongly recommend looking at something better if you are looking for a powered USB hub."
1,flaky POS,"My cyber power CPH420p is very flaky. I can hold it in my hand and rotate it 90 degrees and all connections are lost - I flip it back up 90 degrees and they all come back - it doesnt seem to be the connections of the power or usb devices I have plugged into it. If it were the usb connectors I wouldn't lose all of them at once. The power connection also seems solid, so I can only assume the device itself is the culprit. This is the 4th crappy usb hub I've tried . The only thing that makes it any better than the others is that I can see when the connections are lost, meaning I need to rotate it. It's a POS"
3,Looks nice,"So far so good , looks nice on my table , but was unable to plug my External hard-drive into it and get any data transfer. I have not operated it using the plug-in that goes directly into outlet."
1,"JUNK. waste of time, returning it. ASAP","So with all the possible usb hub options out there i though this product was a solid reliable hub. I checked the reviews and was rated well so i didn't have second thoughts. Received the product and it was nothing but trouble. Plugged the product in and my computer will not successfully install the drivers. Im running windows 7 on a dell. Updated all my drivers, downloaded Microsoft driver finder program and it STILL won't work Cyberpower does NOT offer drivers for their product either, So their product support is worthless. Emailed them about the problem, no reply. The hub can run my keyboard and that's it, won't sync IPOD won't recognize hard-drives, flash drives, bluetooth adapter, NOTHING.Maybe I got a lemon. NOT going to get another cyberpower"
2,Meh.,"I shopped around for a few weeks before buying this USB hub. I chose it because of how many devices it supported and how little desk space it would take up.Unfortunately I may have gotten a bad device, because shortly after I started using it, I discovered that a few of the connections didn't work properly. This made it a 3-port hub instead of 7. The connections that *did* work gave me no trouble at all, and because of this (and my laziness), I decided not to return the device.It stood up straight fairly well, however, but the stand it comes with doesn't attach via latch or anything semi-permanent, so it can too easily be knocked off or lost.I found the bright blue light a bit distracting as well."
5,CyberPower High Speed 7-Port USB Hub,"I liked my first CyberPower USB Hub but needed more ports. I knew I wanted another CyberPower and Amazon had the 7-Port USB Hub which is plugged into my 24"" iMac here on my desk. I highly recommend CyberPower."
5,Very satisfied,"I researched many USB hubs and this one sounded most suitable for my needs. It has it's own power supply for such devices as the iPod. It was, of course, USB 2.0 compatible. Finally, it had a minimum number of ports that I would need.I thought I would need a four-port hub but my CyberPower has five devices connected to it most of the time. I really like having the expandability that seven ports offer. It's true what people say about the bright blue light on the hub and my solution to that was to face it towards the wall. Now it backlights my monitor - cool.Very happy with the CyperPower after two months. Works perfectly with all my devices on my Power Mac. This is a quality product."
5,Very satisfied with use and functionality,"After much, much research, I decided to go with the CyberPower High-Speed 7-port USB hub, as I have a laptop, with only 2 ports, and about a thousand things to plug into it!! It has been very effective; I have my printer, a flash drive, my blackberry, my speakers, my laptop cooling fan, AND my camera all plugged in at the same time, with no performance issues, it's like you don't even know it's there! I like the way it stands on end, too, using less space and there is room to plug something into every single port, a feature some do not have. I definitely recommend this to anyone needing to add to their USB port accessibility!"
5,where to mount it?,works as advertised. mount to top of your pc with mounting tape. makes it rock solid.
1,Not recognized by windows,"I was was of several other customers who could not get any computer to recognize the device, and it was returned."
2,Got 16 months out of it,"Just died. None of the ports work with any device - computer doesn't recognize them. The lights must be there for looks because they still work, they don't tell if the port is working. Got a new hub, a Plugable USB 2.0 10 Port Hub, plugged everything in and everything works fine."
2,works fine but insufficient power,This hub has worked fine but doesn't supply enough charging power. For a powered USB hub today I'm looking for 2000 ma / 10 watts so you can connect an iPad and charge with the display on. This hub doesn't supply enough power so charging is either longer or impossible depending on what you connect.
5,Solved my problems,"I was having issues with my (non-powered) USB hub sucking too much energy off my laptop. This puppy solved those problems, which has me VERY happy. It was easy to set up, the plugs are arranged nicely, and I like how it's set up for both vertical and horizontal usage. It does have some glow at night, but it's nothing that bothers me at all.Highly recommended."
3,Works great Vista OKAy Great Accesory,"This usb hub is a needed addition for my desk. So much easier than going to the tower every time to connect something. I am running on Vista and it supports ReadyBoost and most things I throw at it. Only had a few problems. Microsoft LifeCam wouldn't send any audio through it so that has to be plugged into the tower directly. The other problem is that The computer tries to boot from it when it starts so I have to unplug it, hit enter so the computer will boot to the normal drive, then plug it back in. That may be a problem with the boot order in the bios trying to boot to removable media first. I am not sure. Overall great product. Lots of LEDs to look good on any techy's desk. Don't forget about the power adapter, that is a great feature to charge your usb periphials like Ipods and cell phones when your computer is off."
4,USB HUB,Works well and provides lighted indication of it being in work mode. The 7 ports give me more ports than usual for attaching accessories. The upright version also conserve space on my desk.
4,No Complaints!,"I have had this device for over two years now. I used it first on my desktop, and then when I got a notebook I used it to connect all my extra stuff up to the notebook. The device works very well. It is plug and play which makes it easy to move to a different computer.I would be purchasing this again, however since I have sold my desktop I now have so many devices that 4 just doesn't cut it anymore. I will have to get a 7 hub to go along with this device.Buy it. Easy to use, never had any problems with it. If 4 will cut it buy it. That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because more ports are necessary for me."
5,PERFECT!,i love everything about it. i purchased it after reading other amazon reviews and they were all right. i love it.
4,Simple and Effective,"Not that there's should be anything special about a straightforward USB hub, but this one does its job effectively. It's easy to access, P&P; installed without an issue. I'm not sure why it needs that funky blue light, though.Dick Moser"
2,Better as a decoration than a hub,"If you want a hub to provide a great light show, this is the one. It works, but after one day I bought the Kensington Dome hub--much more useful and better designed."
2,Not for engineers/software developers,I work in a high tech environment connecting multiple devices to my USB hub. But this HUB was not able to handle it for 3 months. For basic home or office use should work very well. For engineers/software developers is not great. Devices fail to enumerate after 3-4 months of use.
1,Extremely noisy transformer,"This product is completely unusable, because the electrical transformer is louder than an old dot-matrix printer."
5,Flawless and easy to install.,I needed a port to accomodate several USB input devices and this fit the bill. It was a snap to install and has worked flawlessly. I got one for both of my offices and move between offices with my lap top. I just have to unplug one USB lead and away I go.
1,Does not work with any case on iPhone,"I had very high expectation. I need this kind of product to declutter my desk. However, the CyperPower will not connect with the iPhone if you have a case on it, no matter how thin it is. This is a significant design failure. It's a non-starter for me. I have to take my iPhone off the case each time, I woulr rather use a regular USB cable to connect it to my MAC."
5,Great For USB Extensions,This is a great tool to use to extend a USB line or lines. To boot it is high speed ports.
3,looks and feels cheaply made- wonder how long it will last for the price of it.,looks and feels cheaply made- wonder how long it will last for the price of it.
3,acceptible,CyberPower High-Speed 7-Port USB HubI did not order this particular hub but it was the same price and seems to work just fine. The exchange of hubs in the order was a surprise. There was no explanation for it from Amazon. All in all I'm satisfied.
3,less than expected for money,"I EXPECTED TO HAVE FLASHING LITES ON WHT PORT I AM WORKING ON , IT WILL BE BETTER THAN STEADY LIGHT . AND STILL I NEED PWOER SOURCE THAN THE COMPUTER , LIKE MORE WIRES TO UR DISCK , I BOUGHT IT TO SAVE SPACE NOT INCREASING THE WIRES ."
4,Good price and works as advertised,Set this up in about 2 minutes and it works wonderfully. My only complaint is with the bright LED light that always shines out of it.
4,Good Device-LED's dont shut off,"This shouldn't be a big problem for everybody, but its a bit of a problem for me because i live in a dorm and the light could be a bit annoying at times. it would be nice if it had an automatic shut off, but thats just me."
1,DON'T BUY - SHORTED OUT MY DEVICES,"THIS PRODUCT SHORTED OUT MY DEVICES. not only my 16GB flash drive that i used to back up my files, not only my hp wireless keyboard/mouse, but more importantly, my license key for my expensive music software. FRACKING A. if you're stuck on getting a powered usb hub, be very careful. don't buy cyberpower."
5,It does exactly what it is supposed to do.,"In a single sentence, this is an attractive, well-made, powered 7-port USB hub that works exactly as it is supposed to work.I have only two small gripes. First, the form factor--upright on a small base--assures that it will fall over every time you touch one of the cables plugged into it. I solved that problem with a little piece of that 3M ""you can pull it off cleanly"" double-side adhesive tape that I scavenged from a coat hook. Second, there is a red LED that tells you that it is powered up via the supplied wall wart and then a line of green LEDs running down the inside of the case that do absolutely nothing except light up--all or nothing--to tell you that you have at least one device plugged in. Why not just use ONE green LED and sell it a couple of bucks cheaper?Highly recommended."
4,"Helpful, Solid Addition to Computer, but Bright Blue Light Tough to Ignore","Over 100 reviews all rate theCyberPower High-Speed 7-Port USB Huba good to excellent product for adding usb devices to your PC, Mac; desktop or laptop. I don't disagree. I think it works as promised, and is well-built by a reputable company that backs its product with a lifetime warranty. I like the solid base and the layout of the device. It's powered (AC) and adds 7-ports to all my computers with plug-and-play compatibility. No driver disc or software to mess with is great. Mine is already full and it makes me wonder why I waited so long to get it; swapping things out instead of using a hub.So what's wrong with it? I give this product a 4-star rating only because I can't shut off the blue power light, which is so bright, it illuminates my home office as well as any night-light! Since the room doubles as our guest room, it would be great to be able to shut off that light without unplugging the device."
4,Functional and nice light show too,Small but effective USB Hub provides a nice light show to boot which I control with a smart strip so it is not wasting more electricity when the computer is off. Really nice design.
1,Died after six weeks,"Lots of pretty LEDs that indicate nothing. I plugged a Blue Tooth adaptor, an apple Iphone,a wireless mouse, and a wireless keyboard. Worked fine for six weeks then in the middle of the workday got an error message from windows that a device driver could not be located. I found a wired mouse and keyboard and tried to reinstall it various ways but it was fried."
2,Won't stay connected to devices,"I purchased this product based on all of the great reviews. I love the compactness and the ability to have 7 devices instead of just the typical 4.However, the hub simply won't stay connected to my USB devices. After a few minutes of working, anything connected to the hub will lose it's connection.Hopefully this is simply a single, bad unit. I will return it to the company for repair and will update this review once I hear back."
4,One of the best USB 2.0 hubs,"This is a really nice USB 2.0 hub. It works way better than the 7-port DLink it replaced. The LED lights are a bit bright, but for me it's not much of an issue since the hub lives down on the floor in my setup. I agree that it would be nice to be able to to turn them off though if it's too bright, just cover over them with a strip of tape-problem solved.I am impressed with this hub and would recommend it.Note-it is actually smaller than it looks in the pictures."
1,Affects bootup of my PC,"I cannot have this hub connected to my Dell PC when I reboot as my PC will not boot up at all when it is connected. While it could be a PC issue, I find it interesting that I don't experiencing the problem when the hub is not connected. I previously had the 4 port Cyberpower USB2 hub and loved it, but I did not have enough ports for all of my peripherals, however, I have come to regret this purchase. Again, it could be my PC or maybe I have a defective hub, but I sure wouldn't buy this hub again."
5,Very happy with this USB hub,Have been using this USB hub for several months now. I am using all the ports and have had no problems with this hub. I use it in the vertical stand and it is very stable and takes up very little space.
2,if you plan replace every year,"if you plan replace every year,bought back March' stop working 3 day ago.have to look for other one."
5,7 Port USB Hub,I found this hub to be more than what I expected. The shape is easier to place than my previous horizontal model. This product is a fantastic value for the price. I would definitely purchase from this manufacturer in the future.
5,Cyberpower - USB HUB,I am very happy with the product. Cyberpower is a high quality product. It works very fine. A Great shopping.
5,great hub,I have mac and this hub is great. I like the front port for connecting items for occasional use.
3,"Love it, but I have issues that might be related.",Other than my computer not going to standby with USB connections I have had no issues with the Hub making USB connections. The only reason I mention it is that I have yet to find the reason I can't get the computer into standby. It freezes up in Standby and I can't turn it back on. The research I did suggests that there is a USB connection that could be the problem. So it could be a device I have plugged into the Hub or the Hub itself. Also my brother MFN printer seems to lose connection to the computer and reconnect. Not sure if it is related. I need to unhook everything and try standby and then plug everything back in one at a time. Issue is effort and unhooking and rerouting cables through my desk again.
5,Good product,"Works as promised. No issues thus far, have had it for a couple of months now. No issues. Would purchase again if I needed one."
4,Great little Usb Hub,"Length:: 1:06 MinsGreat little Usb Hub. 7 ports. 3 on each side, 1 on the front. Powered by AC or usb. Lights remain on at all times regardless of what are plugged into the ports. A must buy if you need more usb ports for your comp. Works on windows 7. Have had almost a year with zero issues."
2,Cyberpower High Speed 7-Port USB Hub,"The unit powered up up fine, and all the ports seemed to work. However, when the 5V power source was plugged in, ALL the lights for the 7 ports lit up! So there was no way to determine which ports had a device plugged in (much less working) and which were empty. This was contrary to the included instructions. If you do not need the 5V power source, then it will probably meet your needs.So I returned the unit for a refund. I bought instead the Plugable Technologies powered 7-port hub, which works fine, and the indicator lights only light when a device is plugged in and functioning."
5,Wonderful USB Hub,"Just got this in the mail, and I am loving it already. I am using it with a MacBook Pro, an it works to perfection. It works right away, and since it came with a power cable, there was no worry that my devices wouldn't be powered. I have an external hard drive, and I wasn't sure if it was going to be powered. The EHD, works fine, as does my USB Mouse, keyboard, VCD, iPod cable, graphics tablet, and flash drive. They are all powered and work wonderfully. One thing I will say is that the hub is pretty small, so don't expect to get a ton of USB devices plugged in, but the port on the front adds some nice spacing for those big devices."
4,Good Product,"The USB Hub works well and has a great futuristic look. The only drawback is that the LED lights are very bright and can brighten up a dark room, defnitely not recommended for PCs in your bedroom."
1,Very Bad,"The Hub can not support the connection with the computer and the self power at the same time, the power transform become very hot in seconds, I lost my money."
1,Product failed within months,"This hub worked only for a few months before it died. While it was working, it was inconvenient because it required a power source."
2,NOT for Powering items connected to the hub,"After reading reviews on Amazon, I decided to go with this product, mainly because I wanted to be able to have power to my connected items via the Hub. I bought 2 of them because of this -- one for me and one for my husband. Well, it works fine and dandy but ONLY when it is connected to a computer that is turned ON or in SLEEP mode. There is no power going to your items if your computer is off. Other than that, the device is easy to operate - plug and play and is tucked away behind my computer (now that I can't have the power needing items hooked up to it!). I would most likely have gone with a less expensive model with as many ports had I known about the power issue."
1,Not very useable,"I expected a dock which could be used with my iPhone. But sync does not work. On page 4 of the manual is written: ""Note: the charging dock does not allow an iPod/iPhone to sync with a connected computer"""
3,Crazy Noisy,"This unit has an almost unbelievable, loud high-pitched whine that comes from the power transformer. At first I was sure it was my office's new AC unit, but ruled that out. Then I suspected the new UPS. But when I inspected the UPS, the noise was clearly coming from this hub's power transformer. It is extremely annoying when concentrating on work projects. I may try to call CyberPower and see if they offer a remedy. If they do, I will follow up with a post."
5,Works fine - very pleased,"After reading reviews on this and other ""powered"" hubs, I selected this one - installed it on a Win XP (SP-2) machine (older). Plug and play no problems. I am using 5 of 7 ports for 2 printers, 2 mass storage and a scanner. Everything worked perfectly and there is no noticeable loss of speed over direct connection to the computer. By routing the wires carefully it is very stable. The blue light is definitely bright but it makes a great night light for my home office. I made the right choice - thanks to all the reviewers before me."
1,Did not work with cool max hd 360,Installed easily. Connected my Coolmax 360 HD external drive to the hub and started a backup. Backup hung in less then 500megabytes. Re-tried 3 times with the hub each try was a no go. Tried 3 times without the hub backup completed without a problem. I returned the hub. Will try the Belkin next.
2,Didn't read my Toshiba external drives,"It wouldn't read my Toshiba external drives, but my ugly ac powered Belkin could. When I plugged in my USB wireless card, it started fine but eventually lost internet connection. Was good for two printers, mouse. Looks Pretty though."
1,Did not work fo me,"Very slow and non-functional at times. Tried it with only one item connected so the USB1/2 issues not an issue. Did not work with Ipod-touch, USB 2 memory card reader, creative camera, cannon scanner. It works as a nice nitelight - LEDs all over the place. (same result with 2 computers)"
4,Great Device,This device solves the problem with the limited number of USB ports on our iMAC and the number of devices that need to be connected. This helps us not to have to plug/unplug everytime work has to be done.
4,Nice hub,"This was very easy to set up and get operational, and it has not caused me any problems at all. As mentioned in some other reviews, the blue LED is quite bright, but my daughters thought it was ""cool""....we all got used to it quickly. It wasn't clear from the description, but I was pleased that it came with a nice, long (6-ft) USB cable so I didn't need to buy that separately."
4,LONG ISLAND,"Really a fun read..the trivia and gossip is really interesting and the book flows well..it's a very quick read. If you have any interest in Long Island or just fun gossip of the Blue Blood WASP, then you will love this book. Highly recommended."
2,Glitter That Was Once Gold,"Poorly organized information that leaves you flipping pages in order follow the content. Information is not cited and sometimes contradicts that from other sources. Overall a quick and fun if not frivolous read however, it will leave those in search of a more complete history on these estates, owners and their current conditions hanging."
4,A touching film,"At first, I thought that there was no point to this film. There really isn't any plot and the hatred of the aunt towards her niece seemed a bit forced. However, this film is meant to be a celebration of marriage. Viewed through that perspective, this is a great family film. Sashid and Amrita are charming together. Their characters take you through the rituals of marriage, right from their initial engagement through their courtship and eventual marriage. A great way to spend an evening with family."
3,Hope it's not gonna be the last one,"Tommy Page haven't release any new album after this title for nearly 4 whole years. Yet this album is really memorable because it has a song ""Missing You"". This is the High Light of this album and this is what his fans are feeling about ""Missing him"". This is not really a hit album but for his fans this must be the most precious one to bring back good memories. Yet the Song ""Missing You "" is highly recommanded."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS 1 & 2.,"Sinbad is not my kind of host. I don't understand what he is saying.Taylor Mason has loads of talent, but not much showed up on this show. This might have seemed better, had I not seen him in the other shows.The concept for this series is great! Good, clean humor is rare today. It seems that in this show, there is an increased use of ""bathroom"" humor.I'm thankful that Amazon has made this and many other shows available."
3,ok,The package was on time. I didn't find the comedians very funny. I thought Sinbad was the funniest on there.
1,I was stunned,"The first two videos were quite funny and with one particular exception, very clean and decent. This video is filled with sexual comments and off-color remarks. One comment made by my family was that ""it wasn't filmed in a church."" That was obvious. I would never recommend it to anyone. Please don't support the producers of this travesty with your Christian dollars."
2,"wouldn't call this ""christian"" comedy - just ""clean"" comedy","Sinbad was the funniest comedian on the show ... Thor Ramsey has a nice, professional delivery style. However, his material was too sexual, considering that small children were in the audience. His act was fine for Christian adults, or even teens, but not young children. The other acts were okay, but a little too ""adult"" for their audience. Taylor Mason was very appropriate and, clearly, a unique talent.Overall, this DVD is not what I expected. I thought there would be more biblical humor to relate with."
2,Funny but Not Fully Family Friendly,"We stumbled across the ""Thou Shalt Laugh"" DVDs last year and were pleasantly surprised at how funny the comedians (for the most part) were in the first two DVDs. While still containing some very funny bits, this third one misses the family friendly mark by a good bit, especially if you have small kids. We try to limit our (and our kids) exposure to the generally crude and profanity laden stand up comedy that is played on radio and TV, but even on ""family friendly"" satellite radio comedy channels some inappropriate content slips through, but we didn't expect that here.This is the first DVD of four, as of this writing, and sadly there is just too much questionable material on this DVD to recommend it for all audiences.CFH"
1,Third time not so funny,Sorry I didnt find this one any where near as funny as the previous 2 versionsSpend your money else where
3,Kegtapper's advice,"Poor content and acting, but the actual music is worth it, subject matter enhances the feel of the times. Numerous stars are cameo'd throughout the film, [See credits]. Actually, there are lot of Motown artists in the movie, you just have to know who they are. [BTW:Who almost ran the star of the film off the road?] - Its one of those films that you will wish you had, 10 years from now. Its one of my favorites. GRAB IT!!!"
5,Just like the original,We bought this as an extra carafe so that we could have two pots of coffee for larger groups. It is exactly like the one that came with the coffee maker.
5,It Holds Yer Coffee!,"Yes, this carafe holds coffee, and does a superb job. But it can also store tea, hot water, soup, hot chocolate, marbles, you name it!I've purchased two of these now. My first one broke (it stopped keeping coffee hot), and the second one is for my wife. She likes to drink that crappy flavored coffee, and I don't want it tainting my Italian roast Colombian experience."
1,Disappointed and $170 Poorer for it!,"I hate this coffeemaker! The coffee never comes out hot enough. I've tried heating the carafe with hot water beforehand and everything. After six months of disappointing coffee every weekend, I finally added hot water (knowing that is a no, no) to the tank. Voila! We had hot coffee that weekend. However, when I called the Capresso service department to ask if that's o.k., the woman shrieked in my ear that I was going to break the machine. She made me test out how hot the water is coming into the carafe. It came in at 175 degrees F., which is within Capresso's range of 170 - 180 degrees. Having read many reviews on the different coffeemakers, I am going to purchase a machine that gets closer to the 200 degree temperature. I can't believe I wasted $170 on this machine!"
2,Capresso MT440,"I have had an MT440, the precursor to the MT500, for three years. We don't use it every day, brewing perhaps 10 pots every month. It worked flawlessly until last week when the machine quit working. I mean dead stopped in the middle of a brew cycle. I called Capresso and my choices are to send it back for service at $40.00, or send it back for a replacement at $75.00. I see both options as good money after bad. The MT440 brewed great coffee while it worked but it should have lasted longer than three years of part-time usage. I'll be going back to a Bunn."
5,Great Product,"We purchased a replacement carafe after I accidently set the original on a hot burner, which melted the feet on the bottom of the carafe. It is an excellent product, exactly like the original, keeps the coffee hot for hours. The coffee maker, Capresso MT-500 is fantastic!"
2,Clarke's Commentary,"To all Christians and in rebuke of the former reviewer: If we think that we can handle salvation, which ""...belongs to our God"", as a fire insurance policy, ""Once Saved. Always Saved"", search the scriptures... I recommed Clarke's work because itr challenges Holy Living. Good, I would say..."
4,Comment on Clarke's Commentary,"The expected date for arrival of this order was within the promised time frame. That was good. The condition of the book appeared to be very good, however, the binding did not hold the book to its cover. I'm of the opinion that it may have been due to the shipping jolts coupled with the book's age that dislodged it. In any event I'm very happy with the condition of the pages and expect to have it visit a book binder. So I rate my experience with this order as satisfactory at 3 plus 1/2 stars... and yes, I'd do it again."
2,Wings to Fly & A Place to Be: An Itrod,"I was disapointed after going through this CD and 20th Century Masters. I have always found Nancy's music to be very humorous, uplifting and honest. That the same tittle songs, should remain on one cut after another is extremely disheartening. If I could find the CD of Nancy's, with music that hasn't already won my loyalty.....I'ld buy it. When reviewing this and a couple other cuts. I was hoping to find something new and enlightening. I guess I am left waiting. However, I haven't given up, Nancy is that good! I hope this review inspires here to continue her work. For the time being, I will keep watching and waitng."
5,Worth twice the purchase price,"This book has filled a need. I used to shutter when trying to write a personal note within a card. Its so cold to just sign your name at the bottom. But to sit there and think of something to write was difficult. This book, even though you can use the sayings as presented in the book also allows you to quickly write your own personal message using the books passages as a outline.The book itself is small enough to carry with you, place in a desk drawer, purse, so on. I now have two copies, one at home and one at work. This book saves me time and helps personalize all my cards and letters. I love this book...it's so handy!"
5,Finding the Right Words: Perfect Phrases to Personalize Your Greeting Cards,I have used this book on many occasions to enhance my writing.
3,"Nice Collection of Phrases, But...","This (very) little book contains ideas for personalizing cards for 30 occasions. The categories run the gamut from frequent occasions such as birthdays or thank you notes, to the rarer events like retirements and new homes. Each occasion has a page or two of short sentences to help you express your sentiments.This book will not really help you write longer notes, or letters; but it is perfect for adding something personal to a ready-made greeting card. The last 40 or so pages are devoted to space for you to keep track of birthdays, anniversaries and Christmas/ Hanukkah/ Kwanzaa card lists. Without those pages, this would be more of a pamphlet than a book. I would have preferred more content instead of space for lists that I keep on my computer.I like the idea of customizing greeting cards, and I'm sure I'll use the phrases in this book to jump-start my notes. However, if I had leafed through it in a store, I'm not sure I would have bought it."
1,"Really not ""the right words""",This book was not what I was looking for. It is just a collection of greetings that you would find in cards. They really don't mean much. I was looking for something more unique.
3,The right words,It is an ok book. A lot of the quotes in this book are phrases used in the United Kingdom and do not translate well to America.
3,"Tedious, non-falsifiable.","Like Marx's, Rostow's historical schema is non-falsifiable. Too, the ""stages"" are rather pat. When the reader is through with Rostow's turgid prose, what has he learned? Hmm."
4,Invicta 9307A,"After reading several reviews on the Invicta 9307A Pro Diver watch, I thought ""at this priceI'll take a chance, I can always send it back!"" The watch was at my door as promised in TWODAYS, the packaging was bullet proof. The watch was every thing I wanted in watch, including theprice! Thank you amazon."
2,Not so much.,"I ordered this watch as a replacement for my current watch, the 200M Citizen Eco-Drive Diver. I work on the water, so heavy duty is my first concern. This watch is heavy, but not in that ""good quality"" way. The screw-down crown was loose and woobly as I set the time, and the bezel stuck after only a few rotations. The band was loose and felt to be not very well constructed. The second hand fell on half seconds, and looked to be almost a bit loose itself. If you never venture near water or boats, this one will work. I do, so this watch ain't gonna cut it. Already working on the return process, which looks to be OK with Amazon. Better luck next time I guess."
4,Bean Counter,Good looking watch for the price. The second hand does not align with marks. The weight and size is good. I would recommend the watch unless you are looking for perfection.
1,Unreliable,Wind stem pulls out when you are unaware and time is lost. Becomes very inaccurate. Happens frequently. It is unreliable. Rotating bezel is not functional. Way too stiff and contour is too slippery to get a grip. I do not recommend this one unless you want a watch for looks alone.
3,watch,"The watch loses 30 to 40 minutes a day. This is a beautiful timepiece, my husband loves the look and feel just not the performance."
4,Great time piece.,"A great time piece, especially for the price, and (for those with an ego) at a glance it looks just like a Rolex. The band however was very large and had to take it to a jeweler to have some links removed ... no big deal."
2,Invicta Men's 9307 Pro Diver Collection Stainless Steel Watch,the watch look good and feels good but the stem does not lock down and frequently pulls out and changes the time and date in just normal wear.
3,Too Small,"Although the watch looked great in the box, the face looked too small on my wrist. Cannot comment on quality of the time keeping etc as it was returned immediately. That's the one the about not dealing directly with Amazon. You have to pay delivery charges for a product you don't want."
1,Wonderful watch ... for about 2 months,"I really enjoyed this watch ... until it stopped keeping time after only 2 months of ownership. It is a very attractive timepiece and the exterior appears to be well constructed. If only I could say the same thing about the movement. I sent it back to Invicta under warranty, but they still charge you $28 for shipping and handling. Honestly, we all know a true swiss watch for $50-$100 is a little too good to be true...and it is. My next watch will be from Orient (a Mako or Thresher). I won't touch Invicta again. Absolute garbage."
1,Not exactly waterproof!,Had this watch for less than 1 year. It is supposed to be waterproof to a depth of over 600 feet. Went swimming in a pooland the water obviously came inside the watch. Wasnt even waterproof to 6 feet!Called Invicta about warranty repair. The cost of the WARRANTY repair is $28 + shipping!
3,"Jeez, man....","Yeah this book ain't perfect, but I also notice a lot of the *one star* reviews(ers) didn't even have the guts to put in a name or even a psuedonym. We get things like ""a reader from somewhere in Canada..."" or something. If there's a better book out there on the subject, I'd sure like to know about it.How about giving some alternate recommendations of other books instead of just blowing this one off? It's helped me out as far as some of his insights are concerned. And besides, the author likes things other than heavy metal. So do I."
2,A mish mash of subjective reviews,"Riff Kills... is little more than a collection of reviews compiled into a book. While the idea of buying the book equivalent of a compilation of reviews is silly, even worse is the fact that the book, in its subjective nature, is riddled with mistakes. Neither a reference book, nor a complete compilation, Riff Kills.. is one man's diary of reviews."
4,Popoff Delivers The Goods,"While one man's opinions is another's buttplug, Popoff offers up a definitive look at what the doers of hard rock have been up to since the sixties. While it is expectant to find ""gaps"" or ""holes,"" Popoff clearly knows the genre and through stream-of-consciousness, and downright hysterical commentary, has managed to pack these pages with his insights into things of the southern path. This is a great read or reference guide for those who are ""unsure"" about what to buy in the genre. Intelligent, witty and very intense, Popoff has a winner. By far, this is one of the best guides for hard rock out there. Whether you agree with the man or not, he's done some serious listening and writing. The CGHM hits the spot!"
5,Where my $ goes...,"If you are a fan of metal, you need to buy this book. I have discovered upwards of 250 great bands because of this book!!"
1,MAy I suggest some alternatives?,"If you are looking for an actual refernce book for hard rock and heavy metal, there are several good books on the market. Look for The Encyclopedia of HR by Garry SHarpe who used toi write for Metal Forces. Older is the HR&HM encyclopedia by Tony Jasper. Also Germany's Rock Hard has a book (hard cover ) out which alphabetically rhymes FACTUAl information - NOt reviews. BTW, I haven't really delved into popoff's work, but the few instances seem contrived or should I say pompous??"
1,This book is a collection of heavy metal reviews,"It is easy to mistake this book as a reference book. The author (being one and the same with the publisher) seem to hint that it IS a refernce book. Rather Riff..is a bunch of reviews all placed in one book. Yes, reviews are just one man's opinion. But the short index and the facts in the reviews show so many mistakes that I would have to say that this book is unfortunately not recommended. please check The Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal, H.M Hand book or Rock Hard's (German) complete 1998 metal reference encyclopedia instead"
1,kerrrap,It's not a coincidence that this rhymes with the British rag Kerrang - this writer obviously reads way too much of this garbage..
2,FANCY LANGUAGE LOW CONTENT,Little information but thesrus-driven language do not assist me in choosing bands and albums
1,Below average collection of nonsense,"Self-appointed knowledge holder of metal, Martin Popoff has put together a compilation of reviews which neither satisfy the information/ trivia gland nor offer any insight into the world of heavy metal.While the reviews are way more subjective than natural, the abundance of factual mistakes/ omissions from discography, and worst of all the incomplete nature of this half book render this nonsense redundant.A bunch of review (akin to owning 10 issues of ANY magazine), put to book by an author whose passion is clearly not metal and who seemingly is out to make fast buck.The author, however, attempts to mask his lack of any clue about the genre with the adaption of big dictionary words reminiscent of the habits of grade school girls out to impress their teachers.Incomplete, misleading and poor will sum this one up..."
1,STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS REVIEWS OF HARD ROCK,This book is a gathering of the opinions of its author on his personal hard rock and heavy metal music collection.It is disappointing to seee that it has very little information.
1,THIS WRITER Is not knowledgeable in his chosen field,"Flipping through the compilation, I noted ddescriptions like The GAthering started as death metal (obviously wrong) or that now they are gothic black (even more wrong) and attributing stuff to bands like Sodom and Destruction which never were true. I suggest Martin P. sticks with what he knows best"
4,After Much Deliberating...,"Maybe nobody else has quite realized it yet, but this book isn't really about Martin Popoff's taste in heavy metal. It's meant to allow the Reader to engage in formulating their own taste--you're supposed to engage in a running dialogue with Popoff's opinions, and this forces you to think deeply and clearly about how Metal affects you, why it gets under your skin and why (when the day is over) it's important to you. Along the way, Popoff (who has a copious amount of knowledge about all things hard and heavy) acts sometimes as your ally, sometimes as your enemy, and sometimes as a Court Jester. Fact is, genuine metal obssesives are a microscopic minority subculture. I'm glad I bought Martin's book, because I finally have someone to talk to."
4,Oustanding for open minds...,"Got this book as a gift and will hold onto it through the Millenia. Don't 100% agree with every rating/opinion of every band/album, but a great source of information that those who seek to expand their horizons, (Metallicaly as well as musically), will enjoy. Often referred to amongst myself and associates as ""The Bible"". Best find out of this book that I never knew existed: Masters of Reality's ""Sunrise on the Sufferbus"". I wish this CD upon every human in the free world."
5,The definitive guide to metal,"Mr.Popoff is the man. As a collector of all things Metal:300cds&some400tapes,I have to say he has written the book I have longed to see published for years. I may not personally agree with every review but at least he took the time to acnowledge some well deserving and long forgotten bands (Helstar,220volt) In short I have worn this book to pieces in the space of three months,and will be needing a new copy soon. Any open minded fan of Heavy Metal can appreciate the significance of this book thanx Mr.P"
3,Good Writer - Weird Opinions,"Martin Popoff is really a very entertaining writer and his reviews have a lot of life to them -- I'll just get that out of the way. It's just that his biases deserve to be known beforehand... He's not big on first-wave speed metal or really ANY black metal (and he surely is entitled to his opinion), but I mean I'm talking bad, nearly scathing reviews of early Celtic Frost and Voivod, while their later failed-commercial records get the thumbs up. It's just strange. On the other hand he's got a good take on other varying forms (a 10 for Iggy & the Stooges' ""Raw Power"" -- good man), nonetheless a lot of bands who made their mark on small indies and then mad bad records for majors don't have their great early stuff dealt with at all ... D.R.I. and Napalm Death come to mind. Guy likes Budgie and hates Lee Aaron. It's a damn good read, just be aware of the human failings first."
4,Good reference book,"Well.....Having read most of the other reviews,I believe I can see where everyone is coming from.In my opinion,this is a good book.Even if you do not agree with the contents,it is neat just to see what someone beside your parents think about your favourite bands.The rating system is fair and,I thought,well thought out.The reviews are intelligently written,if not a bit ""wordy"" at times.You must admit,this man knows his music.I can see,however,how others may be reluctant to plunk down twenty hard earned dollars on a book full of some guys opinions on YOUR music.Then again,many of the entries brought back fond memories of albums and cassettes past.While not all-inclusive (a couple of my favourite bands were missing,perhaps too obscure)The book really is a respectable view into our music,the music of many different categories,but all somehow still basically defined as heavy metal."
1,This Book makes no sense at all,A) How can it be a guide if it's so incomplete? B) How can it be a guide if the incomplete and short list of discographies are all wrong? C) More importantly this is just a bunch of subjective reviews - as a book??? I can write reviews myself - and they'd be written in non-poser English as well!!
1,I am just glad I did not buy this,"But rather flipped through it first!! Not only there are glaring mistakes noticeable even at first glance, the language this is written in is so pretentious and thesarus-wannabe that it drags the 'prose' to shreds. Not only illegible, but also uninformed"
1,This kind of a thing brings down the metal scene,"It has been a heavy metal cycle that once the market starts churning out excess garbage like this people who buy them get disappointed and over time stop purchasing new metal items (music, merchandise, etc)... This disappointment is such excess accessory"
2,I gave it two stars for it's educational value,I finally got this thing set up for use with a part time retail business. Imagine my surprise when invoices added up at the end of the day with incorrect totals....
1,More Like a Docu-drama than Non-fiction,"Buy this book and you will have something in common with Confederate General John Bell Hood. You will both be victims of author Wiley Sword. The defenseless Hood is villianized by Sword's vicious, albeit eloquently written spin. Hood's critics are given top billing in Sword's pages, while Hood's many defenders are silenced. Statistics are twisted to make Hood's performance appear remarkably poor. Sword's fact-filtering, and cut-and-paste journalism will unfortunately impress the unwitting reader, who will be sixty bucks poorer, and totally misinformed on the 1864 Confederate campaign to liberate Nashville. John Bell Hood has been described as the Civil War's most ""famously unfortunate"" commander. Much more accurate and complete information on the campaign can be found within the pages of Shrouds of Glory, by Winston Groom, who doesn't try to create a villian where none existed."
3,A capitalist economy?,"""Bumblebee economics"" by Bernd Heinrich is unfortunately too technical for the layman. For the general reader, I rather recommend Carol Ann Kearns' ""The Natural History of Bumblebees"" (reviewed by me elsewhere). Heinrich's book is more suited for advanced entomology students.Incidentally, the comparison between bumblebees and Adam Smith is ridiculous. Bumblebees are hardly ""capitalist"". They strike me as more collectivist than Mao's China! Apparently, the point of the comparison was to emphasize that there is division of labour within the bumblebee colony.Oh, so that makes them similar to Adam Smith, then. Yeah, whatever. Nobody else than the great ADAM SMITH has ever called for division of labour. In reality, there was a division of labour even in socialist nations, but for some reason Heinrich didn't see fit to mention that...Now you may vote ""non helpful"" to my review."
4,Metal Gear gets a facelift and then some.,"Metal Gear Solid 2 is awesome...well, sort of. It would have been more fun if you were Solid Snake for the bulk of the game. You start on a tanker as Snake, then flow two years into the future and become Raiden. Snake is still around, but you can't play as him. To me, that is the worst decision Konami made. With respect to MGS2, it has some of the plot elements of...Final Fantasy X -play both games and you'll find out why -dad's are such bad creatures aren't they? The graphics and controls are excellent, storyline is full of twists (even rivals FFX in that department) -who in the world tells you the truth, right? Replay value is high, but not to find anything, just to try harder settings. The game is a must -for now- more Snake in MGS3..."
2,mgs 2,Its a a little boring game it should be more exciting for such a higher price game. I think it is pretty realistic.Overall its an ok game...
4,Great game - but - not as great as everyone says -,this game is an interactive movie - furthermore the graphics are too dark - which is used to hide flaws in rendering - i enjoyed this game but consider other games first...
3,"What gameplay there is, is excellent","My experencies are similar to what other people have written. When you get the gameplay, the game is extremely fun. However, there are way too many movie cutscenes. Some of them are extremely long. Most of them I ended up skipping through either because I didn't have over a half hour to sit there and watch, or it just plain got boring.The difficulty on normal seemed to be pretty good. It was challenging at times, but not so difficult where you absolutely had to go and get a strategy guide.Overall, a great game, but the combination of long winded movie scenes and short actual gameplay cause this to get a much lower rating than it otherwise might have had. Especially if you are willing to skip the movie scenes, you would be much better off just renting this game. You could beat it in that time period with no problem."
3,Not as good as Metal Gear Solid--Not Even Close......,I have no idea why the game changes about 1/4th of the way through where you're no longer Snake but this ... Raiden character. This really kills the game (not as much fun to play as it should be). There are too many cinema portions of the game (you start to think is this a movie or a game). Some cinema portions last about 10 to 15 minutes which is way too long. The villains are pretty weak also.The game would have been better if there were no Raiden and more interesting villains. I am very disappointed.............
2,could have been way better,"This game has potential, but Perfect Dark, Halo, and even Goldeneye are better. This game is boring after a short while. The graphics are good, but its boring(...). The plot is ok, but I WANT ACTION NOT A PLOT(well, i want a plot, but i want action more). I guess it's not a bad game, but I expected so much better. It could have been good, but they got lazy."
1,A big disappointment :( What happened to MGS?,"I gave it a one star because I was a MGS fan, and I am very disappointed about this game. Let me first say I loved Metal gear one. I loved it so much I played it three times. The music, characters, and story were great. I was hooked. I preordered MGS2 like six months ahead of time and I could not wait to get it. After I played the MGS2 for few hours, I was bored with it. What? What did I just say? A MGS fan? I missed Snake, the music, Mei ling, and the original crew. The MGS2 story's lousy. In plain words, it was simply boring. Like I said, I gave it a one star because I was disappointed. I assume if you are a MGS fan you would bought this game already. That is all I have to say about it."
2,I personally didn't like the first one.,"I know someone is going to try and bite me for saying this, seeing as how every person I've ever talked to that has played the Metal Gear Solid games absolutely loved them, but I didn't.I've got the demo for MGS2, and played the first game, and if you are one of those rare people who didn't like the first game, this one is more of the same, sure the graphics are tremendously better, but the gameplay is no different."
1,Excellent but...,"Why buy this game now when an enhanced version will be coming out in 6 months for XBOX? If you plan to own XBOX in the future, I'd definitely hold off on the PS2 version."
1,Not Exciting,I've played the demo for this game and it is not exciting. All you do is hide. I am not a fan of this series overall. The stories are boring and simplistic.
5,Fun Gam I havern't played it yet though except for the demo,"it is FUN! you walk on thhe big ship boat thingy with the guns, and have to hurt the bad guys before they hurt the metal gear man! You have to shoot him befor he makes everything boom like a huge bomb!If he does that it is bad. I like the part at then nd of the game where the world goes boom boom because of the bad man!Just dont shoot that guy who likes you because he will die and then after he dies he will kill you and it wilkl hurt really bad. thys game has good grafix and it is vary reelistik.i would go out and get this game right now before the world goes boom boom."
3,"Excellent Game, but very confusing.","I think that this is an excellent game and well worth your time. The only thing that I didnt like about it is that the story-line was very confusing. I probablly would have understood half of it if I had played MGS1. The next game I am going to buy for my playstation2 is MGS1, because I am totally lost in MGS2. By the way, Ive beaten this game twice! LoL"
4,Metal Gear Solid 2 Very Good!,"I love this game, it has some of the best graphics I have ever seen for PS2. I would definately recommend this very cool game to anyone who has a PS2 game console. I admit though that this game does have a goofy story line and extraordinary characters in it, but I do personally like tactical espionage in games with excellent graphics. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who doesnt like a good challenge though."
4,Great game but a little short!,"The game itself was great, the only bad part was it was too short of a game! The gameplay was awesome and the controls worked out great, but again it was too short but it is defiantly worth your money, so buy it!"
2,Two words can describe how I feel about MGS2.....,"BIG disappointment! Yes it does deliver a very realistic experience... sort of. In most games you can shoot at an object with a bazooka, and miraculously nothing is damaged, such is not the case with MGS2. You get to interact with lots of stuff, you can shoot at windows and they break, pick off napkin holders with your gun, and that's great... BUT, this game IS NOT FUN!!! Talk about boring, you take three steps and then a 20 minute movie plays the game for you, yaaaawn. And how about that last movie, it was so long that I fell asleep! Good graphics and the interaction with the objects and people cannot save this game from being too easy, too boring, and unable to live up to the hype that built up my expectations only to be let down. Rent it, you'll beat it two days before it's due back at the video store."
3,"Cool, but...","While Metal Gear Solid 2 is fun, it has several flaws. The first of these is it's short length. I always expect a sequel to a video game to outdo its predecessor, however, MGS 2 seemed only about half the length of the original(which is one awesome game). The second flaw is the extroidinarily long cinemas. If I want to watch a bunch of characters delve into a deep plot for hours on end I'll rent a movie. If the creators of the this game had substituted the hours of cinematic sequences with hours of gameplay I would feel like I got my money's worth. I say all this game is worth is a good rental. I sure hope MGS 3 is better."
3,"Great, but...","The graphics are awesome, the weapons are tight, and all the tricks are genius. BUT, the dang movie bits are FAR TOO LONG. After the simple first mission, I stared at the screen for at least a half hour waiting for the next mission to pop up. Game time is limited - the movies last longer. BAAAAAAAAD. Overall, it's great, but it's a GAME, people, not a DVD. Let's just play!.."
4,"Good, but short","This game offers a lot of fun, like taking people hostage, putting them in lockers, telling them to freeze,but I think it's way to short. It would proximitly take you 10 hours to beat if you fool around quite a bit. But if your a MGS fan then you should buy it."
2,Dumb game,"The graphics and everything in this game are great!!! BUT- the cutscenes ruin everything, it is so boring with them, and it takes several minutes to press the square button with the cutscene stopped. i fell asleep during those boring cutscenes--- BOTTOM LINE___ the game would be great if the company made an option at the beggining of no cutscenes. 4 those of u who r fans of metal gear- i personnaly recommend not to buy this game!p.s. everyone who wrote a good review about this game knows how boring the game gets because of the cutscenes"
1,Not worth the effort,"As usual, the boss fights are too hard at the end, but there is a new twist. A really [poor] plot. Instead of the usual ""fight to save the world from bad guys"", there are what seem like hours of cinemas explaining all kinds of twists and plots, subplots, and even side plots.I don't want to give away the game, but the story really gets in the way of what could be a lot of fun.Bottom Line: If you like playing through the boss fights a couple of dozen times before winning, and like plots that are more confusing than the X-Files used to be(and make no sense besides), you'll like MGS2."
1,Ruined series,"I played this after going through TTS(and I played the ps game), and the stupid storyline, weak characters and horrible climax make everything great about this title obsolete. After all of the hyped reviews, the crapiness of the OVERALL package is shocking. This game will be remembered for it's technical beauty, but the wants-to-be-ultra-cool deus ex machina anime storyline is one of the low points of the industry."
1,MORE OF A MOVIE THAN A GAME! BOOOORRRRRRRIIIIING!,"i would love to know why this is getting good game reviews. it is much more of a movie than video game. i spent more time hitting the ""A"" button trying to get through the story line than actual playing. When i did play the game was great but the momentum was constantly destroyed with cut scenes. RENT ONLY! i beat this game in 3 days and i am no expert game. Like i said it is mostly just watching a movie with little game to actually beat. What a horrible new trend video ""games"" are taking on. Thanks for making Final Fantasy X a sleep fest also. 40%game 60% movies. Booooooo!"
1,Skip this,"For the love of god, don't buy this game, rent it. There are more movie scences to deal with than most blockbuster movies, that you can't skip. The game play is as good as the original, but for about 4 hours of play at a time i played actually 20 minutes. Rent this game, i bought it and now it collects dust. Go buy Grand Theft Auto Vice City before this game."
5,An Awesome Game Not To Be Miss,What can I say about Metal Gear Solid 2...just one word AWESOME!. This will be the game of the year. Get it now and I promise you that you will not regret it.
4,"Great Game, Bad Story Line","I enjoyed Metal Gear and so I rented Metal Gear 2. I am about to beat in (I'm at the last fight with Solidus). I must say that the graphics are incrediable, the fighting is good, the plot is okay but the story line stinks.The new deminsions of this game include putting enemy soilders asleep rather than choking them to death, using desception such as putting out ""girly"" magazines for the soilders to be distracted by, and even wearing an enemy uniform to disguise yourself and actually (for a while) be among the enemy.The negative side of the game was the very long ""movie"" within the game. Once you beat a level, expect a 15 minute to 20 minute break for a movie. The storyline ranges from okay at first to stupid by the end of the game.Nevertheless, this game is a fun game to play and you will enjoy renting or owning it."
1,Above And BEYOND the Usual,"This is one freakin ecstatic game, I loved the first and the second just brang back the first and more. Snake- he has changed, with his mullet and new list of moves. There is only on bad thing, RAIDEN, he is in mostly all of the game play and the ticed me off! TH sound and musical soundtrack rocks, the graphics just kikc but and plot is confusing but good! Almost everything in this game is playable, from shooting glass and hearing it shatter to roling over large gaps in the paths, the graphics are so freking ecstastic. This game includes much more stealth and actually makes you use your mind to do challenges. Ther is one dissapointment, the bosses in the first half are pathetic. If you like the first mgs get this game if you like other agent games you will love this game and if you dont like games youll like games."
2,Average Stealth Game......Enter at your own risk!,"MGS:2 is a good stealth game! It has alright game play, but after that it just falls apart. If MGS:2 was built using the Xbox technology the graphics would have been awesome, but instead they used a sub-par system (PS2)......a hugh mistake!Story/plot is even worst! At one point the character you are using is having a conversation with his girlfriend about what they did on their first date......what? And stuff like that goes on and on and on. Seriously! The cutsences are as long as PS2's load times. Also you get to fight a vampire.........what? Why not the wolfman too! The plot is just stupid!MGS:2 is a rent at best! If you like PS2 graphics, bad plot and fighting vampires then you'll love MGS:2. However! If you love great graphics, a ""real World"" plot (no vampires included), and great game play (no played out boss battles at the end of each level), then I would go get Splinter Cell.......a true stealth game!"
2,[What!? What!? What!?],"Oh my god! When I started playing this game I thought it was going to be really great, as the graphics and AI are impressive. Then as I got through the first part, I realized how much money I wasted. BEWARE! buyers who get this game thinking they will be able to play as Solid Snake. You will be able to for about 30 min and the rest of the game you play as a blond, stupid,...twerp with an extremly whiney voice. ""Theres a lot of pressure on my torso"" he says when you first get to see him. I am seroiusly wondering if Hideo Kojima is going crazy. Rent not bye!!"
5,After Playing My Newly Purchased Metal Gear Solid 2,"People, this game is AMAZING, BREATHTAKING and UNBELIEVABLE !!!After playing it 12 hours straight (not kidding), I can safely tell you, that MGS2 is THE game for your playstation 2,without MGS2 you only have half the value of your PS2.The graphics,sound,gameplay and atmosphere are all shockingly realistic (thankfully, not TOO realistic,that would spoil the fun), and plunge you deep into a Hide-and-Shoot, Stealthy and amazingly clever story (which I won't reveal any details about) that surpasses anything you have ever experienced.To sum this up: You NEED this game. NOW. And I mean N O W."
5,Super cool game,"The only bad thing about this game is that it has too many movie scenes and sometimes they are too, too long.But,The graphics are worth the PS2 consoleThe movies are extremelly realistic in a military wayThe story is excellentThe control is greatThe caracters movements are simply impresiveAnd, the fun is unlimited.I've passed the game all along and I still want to play it"
4,plot is huge letdown,"first off let me say this is an excellent game, gameplay wise. i love all the extra crap u can do in this game. the first person mode is a very welcome addition to the game, and is very useful. now, the plot is another story. it starts off very strong but then it just keeps getting worse. near the end i was laughing at how silly it was. its almost inconprehencable. it really pissed me off. the ending has to be one of the biggest letdowns of the whole metal gear series. good game, horriable plot. and on a final note i happened to really like the cinemas, except for the last half hour or so of the game."
3,Not enough game play,"Wasn't too impressed with this game after all I had heard. The game is constantly interrupted with background information. Sometimes these cut-ins take over 10 minutes and the storyline is very confusing and boring. The game play is what I expected and the game was too easy, even on the difficult setting. Even the bosses went down only after one or two tries. Overall, as far as PS2 games go, this is the worst I have played yet..."
3,"The first was better, still a good game.","This sequel to one of the best selling PS1 games left me a little dissapointed due to that fact that the cutscenes are longer than the actual gameplay, there are parts where I can't figure out what the hell is going on, and I know alot about MGS. If your looking for good gameplay, get the first one if you don't already have it. Arsenal Gear was much easier in this game even though there are 3 of them. 1 metal gear was harder in the first one. However, I will point out this. The graphics in this game are breathtaking. You will see many improvements in this game. You can also zoom in during cutscenes. No point to doing it, just something Hideo Kojima added in there. A 3...out of 5"
4,why the best game?,"MGS2 was the most stunning game I have ever played. I thought the game was well directed and had good visual and audio effects. If you are a: shooter fan, role playing fan, or jest plain adventure fan you need to get this game. It shouldn't be to expensive buy is new under $20.00 everything else is too expencive.And some word of advice,"" If you ever get stuck call from your codec or re-trace your steps.The funest part of the game (in my opinion)is when you play raiden and you and the great snake are battling your way out of arsonal gear.I cant wait untill MGS3 comes out, its back to the jungle."
2,WAY to short,This game has really good graphics and everything but it's just way to short. If they made it a little longer and they didn't put in so much ... talking it would've been so much better. Another thing is i want the ... stealth suit but you have to play the game like 10 times to actually get enough Dog Tags to actually get the ... stealth suit so thats another thing that [is not good] about MGS2.
2,disappointing,"All right. I know the game got a lot of hype because of it's great graphics, and it was the sequel to one of the greatest games of all time, but come on, this game flat out [stinks]. The gameplay is fun, When you're actually playing. 90% of the game is actually movie sequences. I played it through once watching all of them and it took about 16 hours. I played it through again and skipped them, and it took maybe about, 3-4 hours, if that tells you something. Overall a very disappointing game, but it does have a pretty good story so it got two stars."
5,twists and turns and mystery,"A worthy Metal Gear title. The story has a lot of twists and turns. You learn a bit more about solid snake and his ""buddies"". The controls are good and the graphics are nice!"
2,This game sucked hard....,"Okay. The first game in the MGS series rocked. It is my favorite Psx game. I expected the sequel to be my new favorite...I was wrong. The first 1/4 of the game you are Snake, using the traditional Stealth method to take reconnasince photos. Its fun. A little long, but fun. The ship you are on explodes. Next thing you know...you are playing a different character, named raidan. Raidan is a Phem-bot, with pretty much no emotions, a overly high pitched voice, and a feminine build. The storyline is very shaky, with a flat-out horrible ending. It turns out the whole thing was just a simulation. And liquid, is pretty much just an arm possessing ocelot. LAME! Its a huge waste of time, and does not contribute to the MGS series. If you buy it, I suggest you buy Substance instead, since it comes with this game AND more games. I would play this for informational purposes only, but don't expect to be impressed. Stick to MGS4 for a true sequel (Heres hoping its not as lame as MGS2)"
5,Solid Snake,"The only problem with this game is that if your a huge Solid Snake / Metal Gear fan like me you wont enjoy the game as much playing the new character ""Riaden"". Hes good, but hes no Solid Snake.I do hope they make a third game in this series."
3,More play less waiting and watching,"I was very impressed with the graphics and game play in this game, however it was too short. I had been playing red faction before this and was really looking forward to a game that i could really get immersed in. Well MGS2 isnt it. I beat it on normal in 13 hours and a whole lot of that was watching movie clips about things i didnt care about at all. If i had wanted to watch a bad sci fi moie i would have rented one. Mgs2 is superb in all aspects accept the most important one in gaming; how often will a person want to pop in the disc and play. With no multiplayer and such short gaming time, this one failed in my book. Maybe we will see some rainbow six type games out for this console soon, so people can see what tactical espionage and operations games should be like."
5,Sweet,"Look, if you haven't played the demo yet, DO IT NOW! This game will change gaming standards forever, detail, realism, downright COOLNESS ok! Stop reading, and start playing."
1,Big disappointment from a Veteran Metal Gear Fan,"I have all the Metal Gear games starting from the original for Nintendo. Hope this review helps.Here is a top 11 reasons why this is a major disappointment::1) Only five big bosses to killOlga, Fatman, Vamp, 5 Metal Gears and Solidous Snake2) The DVD movie clips are longer than the playing time3) You do not need to use all your weapons4) The story gets complex if u never followed the Metal Gear series5) The story doesnt really have an ending.6) Running around nude is not what I had in mind when I bought this game (you will see what I mean by this)7) No tanks to destroy...I miss destroying tanks8) Over half the building u are in is bombed. You never get to go into the entire complex. Your limited on where to go.9) You never get to kill Lady Luck10) Too easy..only took me 15 hours to solve. The game saves your time.11) No multi-player head to head combat"
2,bad storytelling gets in the way,"The story, dialogue, and voice actors are unbelievably bad. And MGS2's cut scenes are way too long and just AWFUL. The bad acting and dialogue are laughable. The gameplay and control is not a leap forward, as one might expect going from PS1 to PS2.I just finished Halo on the Xbox before i started MGS2, and I enjoyed Halo much more.Bottom line: save your money unless you like bad japanese anime...because this has more cut scenes than it has gameplay."
3,WHAT IS SO GOOD ABOUT MELTING ICE?,"METAL GEAR SOLID 2 HAS BEEN ADVERITISED AS A GAME FOR PEOPLE WITH TOO MUCH TIME ON THEIR HANDS. THIS GAME ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME AS METAL GEAR SOLID. THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS THAT YOU CAN WATCH BOTTLES BREAK AND LOOK AT THE ICE MELT. IF YOU WANT TO, YOU LOOK AT ALL THE LITTLE PIECES OF GLASS THAT SHATTER WHEN YOU SHOOT AT WINDOWS. YOU CAN ENDLESSLY DRAG PEOPLE... THERE SEEMS TO BE A WHOLE LOT OF DRAGGING PEOPLE. YOU CAN DRAG THIS GUY AND THAT GUY. IT BAFFLES ME WHY THEY DIDN'T JUST CALL THIS GAME METAL GEAR (DRAG 50 SOME ODD PEOPLE) SOLID 2.THE BEST THING THAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS GAME IS THE WORST THING ABOUT THE GAME. IT IS JUST LIKE THE FIRST ONE. THIS IF FINE IF YOU WEREN'T EXPECTING THE GAME TO BE A REVOLUTION IN GAME PLAY. ALL THE HYPE BEHIND IT WAS ALL FOR NOTHING. THERE IS NO REASON TO THINK THAT THIS GAME HAS ANYTHING SPECIAL ABOUT EXCEPT THE GRAPHICS. IT IS THE SAME GAME WITH A COUPLE OF PIPES THAT BLOW STEAM. JUST LIKE ALL THE ADDS ABOUT IT."
3,overbearing dialogues but a crazy storyline,"man, i don't know how much more i can take these...these dialogue cut-scenes in mgs 2!! i think for every ten minutes of actual game-play, there is a three-minute cut-scene that reveals the storyline along the ""anti-terrorist mission."" and, speaking of the storyline, it makes the x-file conspiracy pale in comparison. i was a fan of the original metal gear, but in terms of innovation and originality, i have to give it a thumbs-down. the bottom line, it's a rentable game, but i would not spend money to buy it."
4,NOT LONG ENOUGH...,Great game...don't buy the help guide because you will be sorely disappointed in how quickly it's over. Then all you are left to do is play it again and again. Same stuff!
1,what happen????,"I FRIST BOUGHT MGS1, OH I SAY 97,98 BECAME A BIG FAN,PLAY IT OVER AN OVER AGAIN PLAY ALL LEVEL FROM EASY TO EVERY HARD. COULD NOT WAIT FOR MGS2 TO GET OUT!!! WHAT A BIG LET DOWN!!!! I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY LET A GAME OUT LIKE THIS ONE!!!!WHAT (...) WAS MR. KONAMI THINKING??? IF YOU WANT MAKE A MOVIE MAKE A MOVIE, IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A VIDEO GAME WELL MAKE A VIDEO GAME,I PLAY THE FRIST 20 MIN OF THE GAME,WAS OK SNAKE WAS COOL. EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL START OUT FINDING YOUR WEAPONS LOOKING FOR CLUES IT WAS GOOD AFTER THAT I COULDN'T TELL YOU MUCH ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS. ALL I KNOWN IS SNAKE DIES I THINK ?? YOU HAVE SOME BLOND TWINKLE TOES RUNNING AROUND NAKED SCARE OF HIS OWN SHADOW. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! MORE MOVIE THEN A GAME"
2,Very Disappointed!!,"I have to say that this game was very very disappointing. I got it the day that it was released, but found it to be nothing in comparison to the original. I played the original MSG to death beating it for like the umteenth time and was anticipating the release of the sequel. If you're a hardcore MSG fan, I don't think this game will send the shock waves up 'n down your spine like the first did for me and every other gamer out there. I know it's hard to follow a game that practically everyone believes to be the best game ever, but it seems as if they just didn't spend enough time making the sequel at least close to being as good as the original MSG."
2,If you like Solid Snake don't play this game.,"Ok,first of all the graphics rock.Other than that the game sucks. Wow,you play as the main character through out the entire series for about an hour then play as a stupid lame character named Raiden.That makes me soooo mad. Solid Snake is known for this game and is on the cover, but he's hardly in it. Oh ya, the story is crapy too. All this nonsense about the Patriots is boring and almost made me fall asleep in the cut-scenes. You find out the Colonel is like a freaking robot type thing so this question enters my mind. Who was Meryl? Was she a robot too? She was his daughter. I don't have a big enough vocabulary to describe how bad this game is. Don't buy if you are a fan of the series. It takes away everything you liked out of the series."
1,"Great grpahics, gameplay, sound, etc:... BUT ultimately.....","This game definitely disappoints. I would have given it a higher score, but I wanted to bring the avg down. Main reason for this: YOU ONLY GET TO BE SNAKE FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES.The back of the box lies. Read the description on the game box. It says the Snake is going to have to save the world. But no....Then you have to play this long blonde haired, very feminine looking guy for the rest of the game. The proper title for this game should be Metal Gear Raiden.For all metal gear solid fans for the ps one, do not buy this game. You will be so sick with disappointment, like me, that you wont even bother playing it(mgs2) again. This has made me very sad, metal gear solid 1 was one of the best games ever made. It does not deserve a sequel such as this. This is a sad way to end it....."
3,Umm,"Jesus! 90 5 star reviews of this game before it even hit the shops. Just shows how narrow minded most of today's games players really can get. I mean I've played it. I did not buy it, I rented it and what do you know ------- it's an AVERAGE game like its AVERAGE predecessor.The game took 9 Hours to finish though granted the graphics are good and maybe the best yet on the system.Overall ***"
2,WHAT A LET DOWN!!!,"The only reason I gave this game 2 stars was for the incredilbe gameplay. That is when you were actually playing rather than watching the cimimatics. First of all there are WAY TOO MANY cut scenes. They pop up constantly and run FOREVER. I spent more time watching them than actually playing the game. Secondly the story.... Where in the heck did they com up with this garbage?!? A seven year old could have written a better story than that. At least the other games had some sort of realism. This one was way to far fetched. There were some unique twists in the story which were good. But overall...ridiculous and uninteresting. And my biggest gripe is the fact that you don't even play as Snake for most of the damn game. You only play him in the first part of the game which is on the boat.All in all, This is a game that should have been the best out there,... the benchmark for everything to come. But in my eyes....grossly overated and worth more as a frisbee rather than a DVD."
2,Total Disappointment,This game is so not worth buying.I highly suggest u rent it b4 buying.I have metal gear solid and it is one of my favorite games and i couldnt wait for the new one.I pre-ordered it and rented it the day it came out cause i didnt wanna wait for it to be delivered.Im curently looking at how i can return it.The graphics are great and the first part of the game is good.After awhile it gets unbelievably boring.There are more stories then game play.The stories do NOT end.They go on forever and half the time its the same stuff over and over or its info that has nothing to do with anything.I was just playing the game and a story went on for like an hour i kid u not.It was beyond wierd and so boring i almost fell asleep 3 times.So to rap it up when u actually get to play the game its fun but i was really disappointed with the story and just how weird and boring it is.Its such a different game then the last one.So if your interested in the game rent it b4 u waste your money.
5,Talk about Cool!,"This was the first game I got with my new PS2 and I have to say that I was completely blown away. The changing angles, the integrated movies and different twist on a shooter game make this one of the best of all time.I'm still far from done the game, but am enjoying every minute of it. The challenges are mixed and different and the fact that your not trying to just kill everything that moves makes it much more fun!I can only imagine what the third in this series (if there ever is one) will be like! Buy this game!"
3,why was there so much hype for this game?,"wow what a disapointment, amazing graphics, boring game. if you like games with realistic graphics this is a game for you, if you like action packed games buy soldier of fortune or 007 they are much better choices. this is one of the most disapointing games i have ever played with so much hype for it."
2,Movie or Video Game ?,"MG2 is not really a game. It's more like an interactive movie. If you combined the plots of every tom clancy novel ever written, you'd come close to the ridiculously in-depth plot of MG2. The actual game playing is awesome. Great graphics, sound, action, suspense, tactics, etc. But the movie watching outweighs the actual playing at least 3 to 1. They could have made such an incredible game, but used up most of the disc memory on movies and dialogue about 1 minor character being abandoned at home by another minor character. Save your money and play the PS1 version."
4,what a game?????????,"i think that is the best videogame,i've ever played. i don't speak english so well to describe how i liked this game. i hope that konami will offer to us simillar games in the future.. JUST BUY IT!!"
1,What a Disappointment,"It gets 1/2 star for great graphics, 1/2 star for the music. That's it. I hated the whiny character I play. I've killed myself many times just to watch him die. It was more of a movie than a video game. If I wanted to watch a movie, I would have rented one! Other people have already written what I'm saying. The only reason I'm piping in is to lower the star-rating average. The game is nowhere near a four-star rating. I would hate to see someone else make the same mistake I did."
4,Best Game of 2001........NOT!!!,"Blah, blah, blah. That about sums up this game. I spent about thirty minutes STRAIGHT just sitting and watching Metal Gear Solid 2. Thought this was supposed to be a game, not a movie. The gameplay (when you finally DO get to play) is pretty good. But then five minutes later, there is another long winded in-game movie. As I said before: Blah, blah, blah! Now I enjoy a good storyline as much as the next person. In fact I think every game needs one to be worth while. But MGS2 went waaaaaaaaay above and beyond. Based upon the gameplay itself, I would have given a higher review, but it's a vertable snoozefest while waiting for the IGM's to complete. And unfortunately, the first time through, you have to watch them in their entirety to get a clue what you need to do next. Sad to have to sit through a ten minute lecture for ten seconds of information."
3,Dont got it played it on GBC,"i hated the game on game boy color i played it over and over and i never could seam to beat it, But ill give the gae a fighting chance."
5,Awsome Game,"I played this game and had s much fun! They could have made it a little harder though! We rented this game from Blockbuster and my cousin wouldn't let me play it because he paid for it, but at the end he let me play and we had to bring it back in a couple of hours, so I only got up to the part where you get the USB."
5,good clean fun... yeah right,"It's the game your mom hates, Metal Gear Solid 2. It's sooo fun though. It was overshadowed by GTA3 and it ... me off. Also, if you think this game is too violent look at it this way. You can turn the blood off. But theres still gonna be some in the cut scenes. Including head shots and vampire suckin."
5,Awesome Game,"I'm normaly not into these first person view/action games, but I've played the first metal gear and second on regular nintendo. and now I have a PS2. When I saw that there was a metal gear game available for the PS2 I jumped into it. I mean, come on for $$$ I thought I might check it out. Thinking I would get what I payed for, Fooled the hell out of me. Its better than Vice City GTA. If I could give it a ten I would."
3,"Great gameplay, but cut scenes were too much.","Don't get me wrong, I like this game... that is when I'm playing the game and not getting bogged down with cut scenes and worthless conversations.Cut scenes are a valuable part of any game, conveying needed plot elements, but they went a little overboard on the scenes in this game. Do we really need 25 minutes of cut scenes at a stretch? In the whole game, there must be 3 or so hours of cut scenes, and in my estimation that's too much.Some of the communications between characters were a bit rediculous, and the whole girlfriend issue was just plain annoying.If it weren't for the excessive cut scenes, I would easily give this game 4 stars, maybe even 4.5.And if any of the development team who created this game reads this, I congratulate you on a great game."
5,ONE WORD: UNBELIEVABLE.,"This is, without a doubt, the best game ever made. If you've played the original game on the Playstation and liked it, then this masterpiece will blow you away. I'd say that this game can even compare to the masterpieces like Final Fantasy III, VII, or X. You know those are some tough shoes to fill if you've played em'. The graphics, gameplay, and storyline are definitely unbeaten by any game EVER. It isn't too easy, but isn't too difficult either. The only down side is that you don't play as Solid Snake the whole game. Don't let that get you down though, the new character isn't bad at all, and he gets a cool cyborg-ninja sword near the end! If you like good graphics and unbeatable fun, then this game is for you. YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS OUT!!!!!!"
5,The Game,"This game is my favorite game for playstation 2. What I wasn't really thrilled about was that you can play as Snake for only a quarter of the game. And the rest of the time you play as a new guy named Raiden. Besides that the game is cool. In the game you get to have different guns and other inventory items which are really useful at times. I recommend you get this game because if you enjoyed Metal Gear Solid for playstation, then you will really like this 1."
5,smakes return,"game is sweet, grpahics and play couldnt be better, but as a snakeaholic i jsut gotta say not enough of him, story is great but hard to follow for my less intelligent comrades, oh yeah unlike Solid, there aren't any chicks"
4,"a little too much hype, but still good","I just beat this game a couple of days ago and i must say it was very fun. There where a couple a huge drawbacks though. One was the very long movies, they are about 35% of the entire game. Another drawback is the very short gameplay it took me only 15 hours to complete the entire game and my friend did it on only 11(those both include the lenghts of the movies). Don't get me wrong the parts where you actaully get to play is AMAZING. You can snap enemies necks, use portable homing missles and use an whole bunch of guns like soccom, psg1 sniper rifle, M-4 and others.I absolutly love this game and I would recomend it to anyone who doesnt mind watching a movie"
3,A new Hero emerges!!!,"This game begins with some serious promise, and some good old nostalgia with my good buddy snake. I enjoyed playing as Raiden for the most part. I was just pissed off that I didn't get to play as snake more instead of playing as Raiden like 90% of the time.Pros1. The story and the graphics were really great.2. The characters had some serious depth to them, and you were introduced to some old bad guys and good guys as well.Cons1. There was a lot less boss fights and longer cutscenes in this game, and I didn't enjoy that at all.2. You don't get to play as snake that much. This game should have been called METAL GEAR RAIDEN. Ughh. Overall a fun game, but I wanted to play as Snake more.Overall this game was entertaining, and worth playing just to keep up with the series. Also this game has one of the most epic boss fights in gaming history. A sword fight with your adoptive father. Enough said.Game on my Fellow Gamers."
4,"Engrossing, but not the best","This game is a lot of fun and it satisfies on many levels. What I mainly take issue with when it comes to this is that the storyline kind of falls apart towards the end. Other than that, this is everything it's supposed to be; a tactical espionage shooter."
4,Huh?,"I liked this game, it was a lot of fun, but when you get to the last parts of the main misson it gets highly confusing, and the ending is a bit vague. Action wise this thing never stops, who doesn't love the idea of having to run around naked because you freed yourself after being tortured, adn yes it is PG-13. You have to use your head more then in the first MGS. The jokes are great....."
3,It's a real shame...,"This game doesn't play half bad... The gameplay makes you feel all sneaky and commando-like, however, the story is utter garbage! Russian terrorists attacking a tanker secretly carrying a Marine super-weapon...? Hmmm... It only gets worse, some secrety group of ""Patriots"" some sort of supernatural force that controls the US population? This doesn't seem like a plot I'd want to attach to my realistic adventure...I just don't get it, I also see a terribly anti-American message, as well as a mockery of American armed forces. I just expected more, but I guess the game's creators had some motives in this excellent looking production... My advice, rent the game, and skip all cutscenes and/or codec communications..."
2,I Wasted My Money On This One!,"-Chad Steingraber--Paradigm/Infogrames--Level Designer/Game Designer/3D Artist on The Terminator: Dawn of Fate-Sorry, but this game was not any fun at all. I bought this game because of the previews and all the hype, thinking it was going to be incredible. I played it once for about 30 minutes, was so completely bored out of my mind, I shut it off. About two weeks later, I played it again...hoping that my last try was just because I wasn't in the mood for it. This time I played again for about an hour..... I traded it in for Jax and Daxter the next day.....at least I learned a good lesson from it -- don't buy it, unless I know I like it --What a waste, the only reason it's getting 2 stars instead of 1 from me, is because of the graphics. It looks awesome, it just plays like crap. Apologies to the die-hard gamers out there, I just couldn't stand it."
3,Solid Dissapointment,"I havn't played the 1st edition but was solidly dissapointed with the sequel. The game is graphicaly stunning, the movements of the character is fluid and flawless and the story line is intiguing, however it becomes far to convoluted and would require some serious note taking in order to follow completely. OK those are the good points, bad points; the movie sequences are far far too long, you can easily be watching cut sequences for 10-15 minutes between missions, its like playing a movie not a game; the combat action is annoying since you can't get into a real fight without triggering an alarm and bringing an army of gaurds; the bosses are too easy apart from the end 2 which are ridiculously hard; its far too short, if you cut out the extensive movie clips the game can be reduced to 15hrs.Don't get me wrong, the game is worth playing and is enjoyable but I wouldn't buy it, rent it for a weekend and you'll have your solid fill,"
3,Disappointed,"As an avid snake fan I anxiously awaited the release of ""Sons of Liberty"". It was not well worth the wait. Too many cinematics!It seems as though you watch much more than you actually play, especially at the end. The beginning is reminiscent of the previous metal gear but soon turns into an hour long animated movie."
3,Not my cup of tea,"I had a hard time getting into this game. For some reason it felt more like work than the distracting, fun experience I was looking for. Gameplay seemed convoluted and I had a hard time controlling the character's point of view. Weapon selection and use wasn't intuitive or comfortable. The overhead ""radar"" view of enemies didn't make sense to me. This game just wasn't very much fun for me to play, a disappointment."
1,A big dissapointment,"This game was fun for maybe 5 minutes. Compared to the original, this game is nothing. The graphics are amazing, I'll give it that, the sound is good too. New features like being able to fire in a crouched and first person mode is better. The problems whit this game are as follows: too short; I beat the game in a total of 7 overall hours. Cut-scenes; their too long! The begginning cut-scene is long, the end is longer, the bigginning of part B is long, the end is so long I wanted to stab myself in the ear with a potato just so I'd have something better to do!!! Also, the conversations on the codex can be excutiatingly (I probably spelled that wrong) stupid and long. Some of that dialogue is worse than the original Resident Evil (remember after you beat the alligator? Christ). I recommend renting this game, it's not worth the hype. The original on PS1 beat this game to a pulp. I hope this helped."
1,The worst movie I ever saw,The unwritten goal of MGS2 is to navigate through the game environment and reach areas where a mini movie can play illustrating the superior graphics and sound of the PS2. The player of this game is a secondary participant who should be dazzled by long extraneous codec discussions that are both poorly written and inappropriate for the situation. When you wade through the dull diaologue you will be allowed to move through a room or two before the game designers bore you to death with the real action in the form of a movie.I am happy I took the precaution of renting rather than buying this badly written movie trussed up as a video game.
5,the game rocks ! ! !,metal gear solid 2 rocks i think its the most popular action game the world must buy . and i wish to have the full version but my plystation 2 vesion is (pal) version and if amazon . com or .co .uk could send a copy of metal gear solid 2 to egypt i will explode .metal gear solid 2 has brilliant graphics and wonderfull textures and sounds and and its the first game[after iss] which seems realistic i think that you must buy metal gear solid 2:sons of liberty.
5,The only thing better would be Metal Gear Solid 3,"This is on of the best games i've ever played.I reserved it at my local (store) the first time i seen the MGS2 banner..The game is great.The graphics are outstanding and the gameplay is wonderfull..This game is worth alot more (...),I give it 5 stars..Being one of the best games i've ever played."
2,"Graphics are nice, but the game was a disappointment","I rented this game at B-Buster, and as soon as I started the game, I realized that it was not gonna come close to previously created games, such as Onimusha or Devil may Cry. A good game is one that is not pain (...)to play. I would say, this game is more like a movie than a game. You get to control the character 20 % of the time at most. What's fun in that? In addition to this, you have to read and listen to overly annoying phone calls from some dude, who keeps rejecting the pictures of Metal Gear, that you take at the end of level one. I wanted to shoot (him) so bad, he was so annoying.....It is also hard, you get killed a lot. Very big disappointment.Good that I rented it. I was going to buy..."
4,pricless,"this game is pricless but there are to many cutcenes and alot of repeats in the game but all of the other little fun things make up for it, like throwing a stun granade to knock out about 50 marines and collecting dog tags, and much more!!!!!!!!!!"
3,I know Solid Snake and Raiden is No Snake,"Visually, the game is great. As far as characters and plot are concerned, however, Sons of Liberty does not come close to MGS. This is really a disappointment and a step backwards for gaming, particularly given all the hype. Obviously, something went wrong in the production of this game -- reviewing this game is like comparing Schwarzenegger in The Last Action Hero to him in Terminator. Bring back Solid Snake and develop a real plot, please."
5,this kicks butt!,I Think that Metal Gear Solid is going to be the number one hit game in history! For Playstation 2. I have Playstation 2 and played Metal Gear Solid. It was awesome! so i think you should buy it if you have a Playstation 2.
3,Dropped the ball,"Ok, we all know that this is a great game in terms of graphics, gameplay, music, voice-acting etc. What I didn't know when I started playing the game was that Hideo Kojima must have been on drugs to create a story line as crazy as this one. There are so many twists and turns that when I tried to summarize it to a friend of mine I didn't even know where to begin. Ocelot says something about no ""new-age mumbo jumbo"" in the game and yet Vamp is continuously getting shot in the head and surviving. Liquid lying latent in his arm, attached to Ocelot? ...hmm, I don't think so.Well, it's a great game to play, and I had fun with it, but I've watched the ending 3 times up until now and I still don't think it makes sense, in stark contrast to the previous game that had an amazing plot. I'm not sure how many gamers reviewed the game after they had finished it, but I get the feeling they may be in for a nasty surprise(es) as the story progresses as pertains to the plot..."
3,Read This Before You Buy It,"Okay i have waited 6 months for this game and when it finnaly came out i rushed to Toys R Us with my Resver Ticket for MGS2. I was so excited. MGS2 was what was gooing to be the best game ever.i admitt the graphics are awesome and the game play is pretty hard.The first game(Metal Gear Solid)was 1 of my top 5 favorite games. i loved every bit of MGS.i though MGS2 would be 3 times better than MGS.It wasn't. When snake died i felt like crying, and on top of that it gave me a sucky dude name Raiden.Sometimes You just cant get into the game if you dont like the main chacter.My point is why have Solid Snake on the front cover .I wouldnt of bought it if i knew about Raiden. Now i found my self saleing it today. MGS2 was just a big disapointment for me."
3,Nice Game... when you get to play,"The game was enjoyable, but it should be classed as an interactive movie instead of an action game. While the story line is interesting, there are too many movie sequences and they last too long. Konami should have released this game as a computer animated movie then released the game with just gameplay instead of melding the two together. Most of the time I just skipped the movies to get to playing the game again. Rent yes, Own no."
5,I GIVE THIS GAME A PERFECT 10!!!!!!!!!!,"You, as solid snake must once again try to save the world!!!! nothing is better than that!!!! the use of graphics and no slowdowns are the greatest feaure of it all. if you liked the first metal gear solid, then i HIGHLY recommend that you buy this game. If you haven't played the first one, then i suggest that you buy both of them."
3,Not as good as the original,"I played Metal Gear Solid for PS1, and I have to admit,this game is not as ""hot"" as all the ""hype"" suggests....MGS1 is a way better game, MGS2 is boring, at least for me it was.....the graphics are good but the environments are bland and boring....did I say boring again....must be cause this game stinks, I lost my interest before saving the President................Toilet"
4,THIS GAME IS BORING!!!,"this is the worst game you could ever sit down and play mainly for one reason, the inside cinematic sequences are SOOOO LONGGG. And by this i mean that some are about half and hour long and this cuts way down on the gameplay. I highly do not recommend this game because you are going to be sitting there for literally minutes and minutes at a time instead of actually playing the game which of course is the whole point of playing games, is to PLAY IT."
4,Almost perfect,"SPOILER:Gameplay-wise, this is 5 stars. But just because the player no longer controls Solid Snake in the latter 75% of the game and instead controls a... (well I don't want to offend anyone so I won't use a certain term), I substract 1 star from what is otherwise a perfect game."
5,The Best Game ever...,"Metal Gear Solid 2: is the perfect game on the perfect platform, I Have never been wrapped up in such a great game the tension, battles, storyline, plot its briliant, there is quite simply no better game like it, and ever since i bought it i have always played it ove rand over agin you will simply love this game."
2,Just an Interactive Movie,Konami should of bundled this game with a bag of popcorn. Where is the game??? Half of the time is spent listening to mind-numbing dialogue or watching extremely long cut scenes. I would definitely recommend renting this game before buying it.
2,Don' Believe the Hype!,"I was so excited for this game, even pre-ordered it. What a disappointment, your character is a mid 80's glam rock reject, controls and perspectives are counterintuitive, it only took 40 hrs to complete and has little replay value. Worst of all, you spend TONS of time listening to mostly pointless dialog and character animations, not realistic cinematic segue ways but your normal character animated around the game field.Cons:Game play frequently disrupted by poorly animated storyLack of continuity between 1st & 3rd person viewsShort game with little replay valueExtremely limited hand-to-hand combatPros:Great concept- intelligent fighting vs. berserk raging"
2,The developers forgot what made MGS so enjoyable.,"I became a huge fan of Metal Gear Solid on the PS One. So I was going nuts waiting for the release of MGS2. In fact, it was a major factor in my decision to buy the PS2.Now on to the review...First off, let me say the I love the improved game mechanics. The game play is improved and I like it. Now for the bad. The developers went from telling fairly simple straight-forward stories like the one in MGS to this new convoluted, confusing and over dramatic story in MGS2. The ending is especially unsatisfying and pointless. They also made the inexplicable decision of adding long movies that break up the game play far too much. All I can say is that if I wanted to watch a movie, I would have bought one."
5,"THE BEST, BUT CONFUSING","I love this game! The only other game that comes close to this is the first one, Metal Gear Solid. Everything about this game is unbelievably good-the characters, music. The graphics are so awesome that sometimes i couldn't tell if they were real actors or not! The story is the best in videogames, but if you don't like being confused than i don't think this game is for you. Towards the end i really didn't understand most of the stuff that was going on. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play one of the best video games ever made!"
2,IM GLAD I RENTED IT!,"After I beat the first MGS I waited patiently for this one and after I played it I was VERY disipointed.This game just [stinks].Well... It didn't ""[stink]"", I just think it could've been a lot better.Instead it was a lot worse.After the first 1/3 of the game I forgot I was playing a MGS game since solid snake was ""dead"" and I was Raiden, which really [stunk].I missed it's long game length,Meryl,Mei Ling,the real cyborg ninja,the short and sweet cutsceens,the music,and especicialy a full game playing as solid snake.Face it,this game is ******!"
2,"Rent this game, but don't buy it!","Before I get started, I'll give a little background information about myself. First, I'm a big MGS fan. Second, I really hoped that MGS2 would be super cool. Unfortunately, I was wrong.The game is extremely short (took me 16 hours, with ~6 hours being cutscenes and dialogue), and after you've played it once, you'll never want to touch it again, unless you like plots that involve bisexual vampires... for all those people out there who call Hideo a genius, please explain to me the 'genius' behind the president grabbing your crotch in the game!The reason this game gets 2 stars and not 1 star is because of superb graphics and good voice acting, and marginally fun gameplay (when you actually get to play)."
2,"2/5 Stars - Sorry, but I just don't get it.","Blah! I know I'll end up with a 0/955 helpful ranking, but I just have to comment. I'm sorry, but I don't understand why this game was/is such a hit. Sure, it has great graphics and music (which is why it gets the extra star), but other than that...The storyline is very complex. Apparently you have to get some metal gear pictures before the russians come or something. These cutscenes, as stated in previous reviews, take FOREVER. Half the time you don't even know what they're talking about, and you don't want to skip over it for fear you might miss something important. Then when it's finally time to actually PLAY the game, BAM! Horrid camera angle. Oh, and believe me, you don't get too far before you end up with another cutscene. And so goes the game.I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this game, but I just can't get into it. If I wanted a spy movie, I would've rented one. If you want REAL action, stick with Vice City."
4,...,This game is without doubt a disgrace to PS1 MGS. The story just plain [bad] !!!! And what's with this only getting to play as Solid Snake for the very first part of the game then you play as this dorky character named (Raiden) through most of the game.I know I'm being very hard on this game but really this game is not very good at all !!.It has nice graphics and great control but the story really did it in for me.If you ask for my opinion rent it first.I wish i had.RC
5,Amazing,"Metal Gear Solid 2 is the greatest game I have ever seen. It has everything anyone could possibly want. If you don't know if you should buy this, you definatetly should!"
5,Snake and Raiden are a great team for Metal Gear Solid 3,Look Konami Metal Gear Solid is a real hit incredible storyline and gameplay David Hayter is a great voice for Solid Snake and Christopher Randolph is a great voice for Octacon they are for Metal Gear Solid 3. Also make the new Metal Gear much bigger and bader than the other two please I know every person that played this game are big fans of this game. One more thing make Snake have a girlfriend okay SOLID SNAKE FOREVER!!!!! the name for the third one is Metal Gear Solid3:SOLID SNAKE strikes back.
5,Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons Of Liberty,"mgs2 ia by far the best game i have ever played Hideo Kojima is a genious. This game has everything you could hope for in a game and more. great graphics, edge of your seat action, exelents story and chalenging puzzles.its the best game ps2 has."
5,THE GAME OF A LIFETIME,"Unlike the first metal gear solid, this game has more action involved... instead of dodging every enemy, you can tranculize them, so it's more fun. You also get many weapons including the ak-74u, and the grenade launcher. there are two parts to this game... one in which you are solid snake, and the other where you are Raiden... If you have a ps2 and your looking for a great game.. here's one"
4,more game and less chat would have been appreciated,"I'm a big fan of the original Metal Gear Solid for Playstation. I loved the action and the whole concept of sneakong around, and the story was top notch above the rest of the games on the playstation. So i didn't hesitate to pick this game up, but as soon as I finished which was at least 30 hours later, after all the lenghthy cg sequences I just realized I played Metal Gear with no Snake! What's up with that! And the ending was confusing I won't say any thing here ( not that i can explain it in this short span anyway). Well not enough snake to make the rating a 5. If they cut down the dialogue in the codec sequences it would've been alright and easier to bear. I still reccomend it but bear in mind you'll be watching the game more than actually playing."
2,Not Enough Snake!!!,"The controls are excellent, the graphics are stunning, the story is allright except for the bit between Raiden and Rose. You only get to play as Snake for the first 25% of the game. The rest of the time you play as Raiden who seems to be a cross between a Backstreet Boy and a Geisha. If I had known that the Snake character would only play a bit-part I might not have bought the game."
1,"blah, blah, blah","The actual PLAYING part of this game was great. The seemingly countless hours of movies were a little more than annoying. The writers, in an attempt to show us how clever they are, slaughtered this game. We all know what happens when you get too much rope........"
1,This is the worst game for the PS2!!!!,"No one would of bought this garbage if Kojima wasn't involved, because this ""game"" is more like a movie. You only get to play as Snake for part of the game, then you play as some dorky guy. I could live with being the dorky guy, but then every step you make, there is a codec conversation that ruins the gameplay. For example, you don't have to find your way around the building, a codec conversation tells you where to go. Also, there is no first-person view. Stick with games like GTA 3, Max Payne, Medal of Honor, or even MGS 1. At least you get to PLAY."
1,"Use your time wisely, play a different game","I was hoping that this game would be good, but NO. This game (is horrible)! Use your time wisely and buy Final Fantasy X or Jak and Daxter."
2,Quite a let-down,"This game was the ""reason"" to get a Playstation 2.Suffice it to say, I'm not much of a gamer, but I finished it twice in less than a week. The replay value was minimal, unlike the last game, and there were no extras like the VR training of the previous game.Did I mention it was easy on the Normal setting? I managed to beat half the bosses on the first try on normal. It just wasn't that big of a deal.Combine that with a plot that (a) requires you to sit down through hours of non-activity to listen to and (b) makes no real sense... and you end up playing an anime character, not Snake, for most of the game.I can't really recommend this game, except for the technical aspects. It's really neat that you get all the flexibility that you do in this game, but that's nothing new to PC games.... just new to consoles."
1,THE BIGGEST DISSAPOINTMENT EVER,"I gave it a one star because I was a MGS fan(the biggest ever beleive me) , and I am very disappointed about this game. I Mean i loved the first game i played it 100+ hourse beat it a number of times and liked it so much. MGS2 you dont be snake. And the end you wait for the big ending you say now i know whats gunna happen then BOOM it ends and the whole game is pointless. If you never played MGS then you may like it but if you were hooked on the first, give it a rest. I was dissapointed after waiting 2 years. All the screans of snake you see in the first 2 minutes of the game btw."
3,"this is an okay game, but has no replay value at all!","This game is great, for the most part, but don't listen to people who say for you to buy it. It's better to rent the game twice to decide if you like it (...)"
3,A Breakthrough In Gaming But Alittle Boring!,"I'm a serious MG fan and I also found MGS2 alittle weird and boring.The plot is cool at first but gets harder to follow at the end.It also has WAY to much talk and the ending is disappointing.BUT! The game and game play is awsome. The soliders are harder to fight cooler graphics cooler moves!I thought this was the last one why do they leave it wide open for another one?What happened to Ocelot in the end? Wasn't he the biggest punk in MGS how is now a master mind in MGS2?? All in all it's worth buying if you like MG, but do like I did during the talking scenes get up and get a drink!"
5,The best game for PS2 so far!,"I just got this game today and I wasn't dissaponted, not one bit! It's the best game I have played for the PS2 so far! Great, great graphics, excellent storyline...what more can I say?? Excellent game! If you have a PS2, you've got to own this game! Do it now, 'cause I don't think you'll get a copy 'till next year! Sit back and enjoy: thanks again, Konami!"
4,Perfect condition/Slow shipping,I ordered a brandnew book from this vendor and the book came in perfect condition. However shipping took almost a month. But I am located in Hawaii which could explain the extra shipping time.
5,Great Purchase,"The referenced book is one of the best written on the subject of marketing: complete, up to date, pertinent case studies,well worth the purchase price. The product advertised is the product received and was received in the time frame allowed and in excellent condition."
3,"OK book, but redudant for my needs","This was 1 of 3 required textbooks for an MBA course I'm taking. Framework for Marketing Management was the main book and I felt this textbook just echoed what the other textbook said.Still, it is a good textbook with good examples. I always expect school textbooks to be very dry and boring, but this wasn't the case with this book, or ""Framework for Marketing Management."""
5,Excellent book,Excellent and very complete coverage of the marketing discipline for marketing students. Highly recommended for anyone taking up or keeping up with the new developments in marketing today.
1,Vastly over-rated,"This is a typical textbook in MBA programs - outrageously overpriced, recycled over and over again, with the obligatory ""revision"" every so often, just so they can kill the used book market and force students to buy the newer editions. If you have to take marketing (I don't consider the subject to be worthy of capitalization) then this is the book you have to have. Otherwise, there is no reason to buy it.Oh yes, did I mention that the index is pathetic? I believe that college professors do that intentionally, just to make sure that the students read the text, instead of using their time efficiently in looking up what they need."
1,"Marketing Management, 12th Edition","Much to my chagrin, I have discovered that the book cover does not match the one that Amazon advertised, but two things bother me immensely:1) I noticed that the book came from India and that the ISBN # for this book does not match the ISBN # I had ordered.2.) It is a first Indian reprint, 2006 and states: ""This edition is manufactured in India and is authorized for sale only in India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.This has left me to wonder if the content in this book even matches the content of the book that I need for my course which starts in three weeks.Where is the quality control?"
1,Delivery was wayyyy to late,"I ordered for this book a week before skl started... It never came until the 4th class.. seller wasnt helpful as there was no tracking number available to track item, Also I never got a price cut since the book came in late.Service was terrible...I have shopped alot on Amazon for my text...this was the worst i have ever see!"
1,It never arrived,"The book never arrived, I wrote and email to the seller and never answered. I made a claim and got a complete refund from Amazon."
3,"Over-Rated ""Standard""","Although I can't compare the 12th edition to past versions of this text, I can say that the latest edition is heavy on theory with little quantitative data to back up its assertions. My MBA class's consensus was that the book's quality varied wildly from chapter-to-chapter, as if some of the chapters were written by one of the co-writers without any collaboration."
3,Good Marketing Management Overview,"I was assigned this textbook for my MBA course in Marketing Management. Although the material is somewhat dry, tedious to read, and common sense, it does provide people with a good, broad overview of marketing principles. The text provides a lot of real-world examples with fairly recent events, companies, and applications of principles."
1,this book sucks,this book has been published and republished with the only chnages being the chapters reversed and new examples. the index in the back however has not been updated so it references incorrect pages. several acronyms used are not explained. terrible book.
4,An eerie book about eerie things,"This book is strange, haunting, depressing, and beautiful, like a view of an industrial park at sunset. Mulcahy gives hellish glimpses of our world as it could be, and drives it home with a sarcastic undertone that can praise as well as damn. Very eerie stuff indeed. Good luck keeping a similar world-view as you had coming in"
1,wrong scent and arrived completely smashed!,"I received the wrong candle - different from what was ordered. Also, it arrived completely smashed in the box, glass shattered. I'm very disappointed - it was supposed to be a Christmas gift! I will not pay for shipping back a broken item. I don't think the post office allows mailing if broken glass anyway."
5,Read this.,"If you think you are anabaptist in character then check this book. It shows real christians and real suffering for Christ. Oh, that God would light the fires..."
4,How did they fly under the radar?,"All three LPs (one an EP) are outstanding. It really come across as a fusion of neo-psychedelic electronics and urban country rock (with an emphasis on the former).For the period, their sound is quite unique and it almost a precursor to the more extensive neo-psychedelic bands that have come out of Australia in recent years.OK, the vocalist isn't the best, but the harmonies mask most of the shortcomings. And vocal prowess isn't a key point of the genre in any case (nor has it ever been the halllmark of prog-psychedelicmusic, witness Pink Floyd).Adjectives such as dreamy and cosmic do come to mind, but this is also a band rooted in the Graham Parson's school of country.In any case, these albums are worth owning, and it really doesn't matter which one you start with."
4,pop pop pop pop,"indulge your ears in some could country-tinged psych-pop california style - Byrds-esque and quite catchy - good for pop fans. not a classic, but a solid record with some lush and hummable tunes. my favorite track is The Old Sea Miner - lots of fun. Enjoy!"
1,utter nonsense,"this band is utter nonsense: if they're ""artists,"" they're con artists, all right, feebly nicking Byrds' riffs, Burritos' feels, singing almost Olypianly out of tune--and having the AUDACITY to present tripartite harmonies. a lot of people have been fooled by these posers--don't be one of them. this album's a travesty. I want my money back!"
4,Out of nowhere.,"For a debut album this is brilliant. These guys obvisouly have great record collections and use them for a great effect here, imagine a cross between the grateful dead, the beach boys, the byrds and apples in stereo and you'll have an idea how this band sound.(The use of steel guitar is especially brilliant!). Fans of quality music will adore this. Do not hesitate."
4,Books Available,I too bought this toy for my 4 year old barbie mad daughter at Christmas. I looked around for the extra books as promised and today I sourced a supplier in the UK. They are 'Clove Technology' (on 08707 280038) and they have one further book and cartridge available for 12.90 with 2.00 post and packing.The makers themselves promise a further two books in the near future and then this company will sell them. I do hope this helps anyone who like me was beginning to think this toy may have been a bad mistake!
4,Nice but could use some work,"This is a very fun and exciting toy, but like most toys it has its flaws. My daughter got one for christmas and I didn't think it worked properly so I took it back and got another one. This one seems to be the same way so I am assuming that is how they all are. It isn't overly sensitive and sometimes won't respond to my daughter touching the page. And you do have to have patience for Barbie to finish talking before trying to touch the page to give your answer, but other than that so far my daughter (who is 4) loves it. Especially when I hook it up to the TV."
1,Daughter was disappointed,"Santa brought this item for my 5 year old for Christmas. We had a hard time getting it to work even after following the assembly directions closely. After it finally worked, it only worked for about 10 minutes then it stopped. It did not work again after that, so we returned the item. Don't buy it. It's a waste of money."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"My daughter wanted this for Christmas, so Santa bought it. It is the biggest piece of junk yet. We had problems with it from the time we first put the batteries in it. It is temperamental. At times it will work when we use the touch pen and at times we get nothing. To get the real effects, you need to be connected to the TV, even though it says it can work alone. The pages of the book do not go in properly. This causes the device to not work correctly either. You must use batteries with it in order for it to work. However, you can order an adapter for more money.Santa also brought the Barbie Beauty Boutique. This software was excellent. My six year old loves it.Don't waste your money on the B Anything Education Center."
3,You can't expect much for $9.00,"I bought this for my 5 year old daughter. It is a little complicated for her and I was dissapointed that you can't buy the memory card or extra books. However, the item was only about $9.00, so for that price, it's great. I would have been more upset if I had paid a lot. Also, if you want REAL educational toys, stick with Leap Frog. This is more toy."
4,Barbie B Anything Education Center,"I had absolutly no problem operating the toy nor did my five year old. I also do not see what joy a child would have playing with the toy without it being connected to a television. That feature alone is why I purchased it. All it takes is a couple of C batteries or the purchase of an adaptor. Switch the TV function to video and plug it into the television. It is comparable to the games played on the Barbie website. I mean really, what does one expect to get out of an electronic device that costs $39.99. You get what you pay for. I quess they expect Barbie to get up and walk out of the TV and do the electric slide or recite the bill of rights. The toy was all that I expected it to be for the price I paid for it. My five year old enjoyed playing it and had the patience to play the game with out any difficulty."
3,Additional Books and Cartridges,There are two additional books and cartridges that are sold on Ebay.
3,Supply Disappointed,I am so disappointed with this product.The box states catridge included (BIG LIE) and then the company or any other stores DOES NOT provide you with such items. This is sitting there collecting dust and proving how much I've wasted my money. If only Oregon would step up to the plate and do something about this they would then have a great product.
4,"very good mat, expensive shipping","This is a very good product. Rubbermaid mats used to be in all the stores, but have been replaced by cheap imports which don't stick. This is a heavy duty mat which I like a lot. I have an old home and the bathtub is slick. The strips don't stick as well as hoped, but this is a good solution.Shipping seems expensive, and again these days most shipping is expensive. Had these before and they last very well and do a great job of providing non stick.UPDATE Nov 1, 2011 - still working fine, keeps me from slipping, still liking itUpdate May 15, 2012- still liking it"
3,Could be thicker,"It's not easy to find a regular rubber tub mat, so I was happy when I found this one. The size is generous and it definitely stays put. It's nice for baths. However it's not too pleasant to stand on. You feel all the little suction cups under your feet. If the top layer were thicker, that problem would be solved. I ordered the white color, and it's off-white not white white like I expected it to be.Also as others say, shipping is too high."
5,Comfortable and Safe,"All of a sudden I could not find in any store. This is another product that I have used for at least 16 years. Rubbermaid makes the best tub mats that I know. The suctions cups are the best. Its the only one my husband likes, it's soft. It is an extremely safe tub mat. But, of course I found it on Amazon, thanks again Amazon..."
1,Won't Lay Flat,Much lighter weight material than used in earlier mat. Retains curled edges from shipping container wrapping. Works OK once it has been forced to flatten on shower floor.
5,Rubbermaid Shower Mat,"This Rubbermaid shower mat is well built,functional, & WILL keep you from slipping & busting your butt in the shower. I highly recommend it. The life (or hip) it saves may be your own!"
4,"Simple, sweet and perfect","I am very pleased with this purchase. The mat is nothing special in the looks department, but I dont need anything fancy myself. I had a fancy pebble mat and it hurts your feet and collects all manner of dirt and hair eww. Needless to say when this baby showed up I couldn't wait to get it in my tub. Anyways this is real comfy on your feet and its anti microbial a major plus for a girl who doesn't LOVE to scrub the tub constantly. Great buy!"
2,Not mildew resistant,"I peeled this up from my shower today and it was super moldy. I assumed mildew resistant meant mold resistant. I guess that's my fault. It needs to be able to drain, or at least have access to air or it will get really moldy."
4,Season 1,"The series is typical Nero Wolfe, it can drag along for a few minutes but ultimately the conclusion is always surprising and often humorous."
1,Mystery series,"I originally reviewed this 48 hours ago but it was not published. I have to have my say on this series: A&E; cancellation, justified, the actingso over the top. The scenery just isnt there some dark green painted props. What are people thinking to say this was an outstanding tv series. All the face shots, the shoe shots an occassional 50's car. All to hide the fact that the series was done on a shoe string.Save your money."
1,Nero Wolfe - - The complete First Season,"the entire produciton - - The direction, the acting ( Except Timothy Hutton) photography, scene connection was a disaster... What a waste of our time to watch it and for the money spent to produce it........ After Thayer David and William Conrads portrayals of Nero Wolfe Maury Chaykin is exhausting and tiring to watch.... Horrible..... Go buy yourself a good meal instead of this class b production....."
5,Fabulous,"Unlike the other reviewers, before seeing any of these movies I had read all of the Rex Stout Nero Wolfe stories and books. I can tell you, for example, that Cramer does indeed light his cigar in the office, in two of the earlier novels.I half-expected to be disappointed, but I was more than overjoyed at these movies. ""Eeny Meeny Murder Moe"" is very good. ""Over My Dead Body"" is very enjoyable. The cream of the crop is ""Prisoner's Base"", which is excellent.If you're a Nero Wolfe fan, don't hesitate. You won't regret it. Series 2 is out, too!"
5,Best Wolfe Ever,"Those of you who know Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodmin will be very pleased with this film version. Every detail is exactly as Rex Stout intended and described. The dialog is perfectly preserved and the stories adapt well to video. The casting is a particular joy in that the players remain the same through all of the stories, with all except the few main characters playing different roles in each. If you have never met Archie and Mr. Wolfe before, this is a wonderful introduction."
5,To see it on the small screen...,"I am a fan of the Rex Stout books that star the fat Nero Wolfe and cheerful Archie Goodwin. So A&E;'s TV episodes based on the books was a new series that I welcomed, one that I came to enjoy. Being able to have the series available on DVD, to me, brought me even greater happiness. I just wish there was some kind of extras. Timothy Hutton and Maury Chaykin are perfect for the parts of the main characters. Mr. Hutton is not just one of the producers but also directs.The sets, cars, atmosphere and outfits all help to bring about the stories in the style of the books. Try to get it, used or new."
5,Rex Stout would be proud,If you like the books you will enjoy watching this series. Entertaining and faithful Rex Stout's unique writting style. I just wish A&E had continued adapting the books to film
4,COOL !!,"Ivie really *WAS* Duke's best vocalist. This is a great compilation of some of her best recordings with the Ellington Band. If you love that 1930's heavy sounding jazz with hot vocals this will be a very welcome CD. And of course the band is superb as ever, with some very important recordings throughout. There never was another ""Ivie"" for Ellington and the band."
5,"Handy gadget, load photos without camera","I had not used this device before, and did not expect to find it useful, but decided to try it for the price, partly based on other reviews.I found it very convenient to be able to use multiple memory cards in my camera, and to load the contents later, without having to have the camera available. I was on a trip to Italy, and to reduce the loss of photos in case my camera was stolen, I changed cards form time to time. At least, I would have the majority of my photos.I had little trouble using the cassette, getting my PC to recognize it (with the card inserted) as a mass storage device. The transfer rate seemed fine: SanDisk Extreme HD Video - Flash memory card, 16 GB, Class 6 SDHC. I loaded 1836 photos, including panoramics (about 7 GB) in 9 minutes on a standard USB port on my PC.Very convenient, I am glad I got it."
5,SATA Hard Drive Cable,"This SATA Hard drive cable works just fine and is very easy to install/use. And, of course, online price can't be beat."
5,"STARTECH 36""SATA HD CABLE","So far, exactly as advertised. The 90 degree angle on one end is perfect for fitting into the tight areas on todays motherboards.Is not brittle or rigid, but easily bends around corners to conform to the shape of power supplies, cards, etc. Comes in different colors to make it easy to determine which cable goes where. Would definitely recommend."
2,uninspired and forgettable cop vs. killer movie,"Blowback follows very well trodden ground. A standard cop vs. serial killer movie, it sticks to the cliches of the genre. The killer's ""twist"" is that he kills each victim in the style of a martyred saint, with a bible reference in a test tube placed in the mouth. Perhaps the intention is to echo other recent screen psychos like Seven's John Doe or Silence of the Lambs' Buffalo Bill. Blowback's villain is, however, like all the other characters, lacking in character depth and ultimately unconvincing. Mark L. Lester, the director, has been a prolific producer of mediocre action movies, notably Commando and Big Trouble in Little China. Some of these can perhaps survive as late night movies to be watched over a few beers. Still, even among the lesser cop movies, there are a lot that should be seen before this one. Try Fallen or Bone Collector. Regarding the DVD, it's 3:4 format, with no features (not that you'd want them)"
2,For rank beginners only.,This is a frustrating little guide for me. I'm constantly coming across birds that don't seem to be in this book. If you're a beginner and don't know many birds at all this might be a nice intro but you'll out grow it in a week or two and if you already know most of the common birds in your area this little guide will drive you crazy. I don't care how portable it is.
5,Best Field Guide book!,I like this book because it is simple and easy to use. Because it is color coded by birds. Its great for the beginner birder. Plus it let's you check off the birds you have seen in the back of the book. I would definatly recommend this book to any beginner birder as their first book of purchase!
4,"Nice little book, does its job","I was soo addicted to my old Peterson guide, and I bought this for my Mom, who loves the format. After using it a few times, I like it better. Its a good little, usable field guide. Now we keep three bird books in a basket with two sets of glasses everytime we sit out in the yard. Mom grabs this one first, then I wrestle it away from her. Pity summers ending.wish I could buy a copy of his birds of Willamette valley on amazon."
4,Gift for my 7yo,"Really great book my son carries it everywhere. We bought it last year as a gift. He loves to tell me what bird is doing what in the back yard. Even if it is male or female. We take it camping and on road trips. It is a lot of fun for our family. My 3yo now will tell me what bird is in our neighbors yard.I put 4/5 stars for some reason it doesn't show the bird my family always called a blue jay...we see them often in our yard and I did as a kid growing up, but there is nothing like it in the book so how that can be I don't know. Kind of frustrating! Very easy to use!!! Set up by color, very nice photos to identify, nice maps showing areas that they live, and what season they live there if they migrate. Super cool. : )"
2,Interesting in a boring kind of way,"First of all the title and cover are totally misleading. I was expecting more of a horror movie or at least some kind of survival situations. The first episode is a girl who has a failed suicide attempt, gets her wrist caught in the rope, spends the next day trying to free herself, and eventually the rope just breaks and she's free. The second episode is about a girl who locks herself out of her hotel room, ends up in her boyfriend's room across the hall and finds out he's cheating on her. There is basically no talking throughout. The first episode is very boring. The second episode has a little more going on and is even a little comical to me. Dont expect much from this ""movie"". Only redeeming quality is that the girls are pretty attractive and spend most of the time toppless."
3,"Sorry, but i cancelled the order","Ken Cohen is well known. There are excerpts of his Qigong training on you tube. I decided to try some of the exercises for free first, see if they benefited me, and then perhaps reorder."
3,Calming and meditative DVD,"This DVD contains Tibetan chants accompanying animated images of 3 Buddhas: Chenrezig (Avalokiteshvara) the Buddha of Compassion, Buddha Sakhyamuni the historic founder of Buddhism and Mahakala (six-armed black Mahakala) the Protector.The music and animated images do give a wonderful ambience for anyone practicing the Dharma. Just pop it in, and either use it as a meditation focus or just to create a more contemplative atmosphere in the room.The only reason I gave it three and not four stars is because there could have been more Buddhas (Manjushri the Wisdom Buddha, either Tara, Vajrasattva, etc), but if they are still down the production pipeline, then I eagerly await the follow-up DVD ;-)"
5,"Hey, XSIman","LightWave is a great package. So is XSI. Your post is inappropriate, and has nothing to do with this training course. If you have a problem with LightWave, don't deal with it here."
2,Effectively Useless,"The book has no Title or Copyright page, rendering it effectively useless asit cannot be cited in a bibliography or footnote."
2,What Was I Thinking?,"One day I heard a classic song by Deodata, which reminded me of an album I once owned and thought I loved called Happy Hour. Well, I really don't know what my frame of mind was back then, but now, this CD is just plain old disco, and not the memorable, catchy, still fun to dance to stuff. Unless you LOVE disco and just have to have all disco recordings ever produced, skip this one. It's not Deodata at his best. Sorry."
2,Does NOT look anything like this color!,This color is actually more grey in color & I was dissapointed. I couldn't use it & had to go out & actually test colors before I found one that matched perfectly
5,LEGACY OF DARKNESS,this is the best yu-gi-oh set to come out yet. it is loaded with many great cards and has a high educational value. your child will gain stratgey and memorizaton from playing this card game!
2,Oh...this Display is not worth buying,This Display has not very good cards in its Boosters. You should buy a Pharaos' Servant Display or a Metal Raiders Display
3,hard to find,"Durgol is so hard to find, I had to order it from Canada and directions were not clear. Also, spent a lot for shipping and was left wondering if vinegar would have worked just as well. Our Capresso coffee maker recommends durgol so that's why we ordered it. Hope this helps."
3,Colors are not truely represented,The actual color of the product is very different from the way it looked in the photograph. The slipcover is otherwise well worth the reasonable price.
5,An eye-opener,"Morris Rosenthal was the first to posit the idea that POD books are best sold online and to a niche audience. He clearly delineates the steps needed to take your manuscript and turn it into a book via Lightning Source. While some of the material is dated, due to developments in 2007 and 2008, the basic idea still stands.Some of the material in the book is rather technical and would be better digested by computer savvy people than by a technobooby like me. However the general concept still stands. Rosenthal's analysis of Amazon book rankings is obsolete--at least it was in the version of the book I read. But the basic idea is very important. Read it along with ""Aiming at Amazon"" by Aaron Shepherd."
2,Uneven writing,"This book contains some useful information, but the writing is uneven. The author is often wordy and drifts into unrelated tangents, so I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Not what I needed...,"I have one book out on CD rom...and am an artist that teachers painting. Someone suggested I look into POD options...but I knew so little I went with the first good book recommendation. The book is okay, but so no one commits my error....if you are looking to write a how-to which would include good images, printing with POD is a toner method and images are not good. Save yourself time and money..."
4,great for the price!,"not as soft as i'd hoped, but still great- i think once i use my bike more and wear the seat in it'll be geat- or maybe if i weighed more it would be more comfortable ( my boyfriend likes it)- still worth it though-"
3,Good cheap seat.,"My 15 year old seat was worn torn and ugly and I saw this on sale so I bought it. Its about as uncomfortable as the old seat on my 10 speed but it sure looks a lot nicer. The seat is pretty firm, so lighter people may not get much cushioning out of the padding. You do have to tighten the snot out of the bolts otherwise it will tilt after its mounted. Just like most seats, you can flip the mounting bracket and slide the seat forward or backward on the rails to fine tune your reach to the bars.Edit added here: After switching this to a few different bikes I got to say, this seat works a lot better on a relaxed bike than a ""sport"" bike. The cushioning actually works when you have lots of weight placed on it. On a road bike with your weight on your legs and arms its not so good. Make sure you're going to use it only on a short trip bmx/cruiser/hybrid if you buy it. Something with the seat lower than the bars. FYI its not as fat as the fisheye photo would lead you to believe.."
5,Budget for your bottom.,"I tried out my new saddle today and rode 4 hours on it. It was a very comfortable ride throughout and for the price I would definitely recommend it. The seat has a very cushy feel, but I wouldn't claim it as being ""pillow soft."""
2,Great price but uncomfortable,I have not ridden my bike as much since I bought this seat. It is too uncomfortable. Its narrow and 'bony'.I am female and it hurts after a mile.Its a shame as the price is excellent and it was easy to install.
4,Great value.,"I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of this saddle, given how inexpensive it is. It is compact and comfortable, definitely softer than the standard saddles, although it may not be the softest money can buy.Overall, a great value. My only regret is that I did not get two."
2,Bike Seat is Just OK,"I didn't look very closely to the description apparently. The photo makes this seat look wider than it is. This bike seat is as narrow as a regular bike seat, its only a little cushier. I could have spent the same amount of money and got a wider, comfier seat at Wal-Mart. Overall, its just OK. Better than the original seat that came with my bike."
3,Better but,"This seat is WAY better than the original that came with my Schwinn 10-series exercise bike. Smaller, better suited to my petite frame. However, I'm unable to ride more than 30 minutes without my derriere getting numb-even with frequent repositioning. Perhaps it's just that I'm out of shape and will improve as I tone up. We'll see."
4,"Soft, Durable Seat","This seat is comfy, but still sturdy enough it feels like a racing seat. The perfect seat, especially for the money! I've been riding 10 total hours the past 2 days, and I haven't a bit of soreness!"
3,not the best thing,"it is good nut be careful after 10 days the padding with the gel started coming off, now it is not that comfy anymore."
1,PRODUCT NOT PROPERLY DESCRIBED,"I am sure that the product is a ""good"" product and very well made, but the full description of the product was not conveyed properly in the ad. In the picture of the product, it appears to be a full size comfort bicycle seat, but when received, it is more like a racing bike seat, and not very comfortable.I returned the product for credit, and apprecited the way the credit was handled and expedited.Will certainly make other purchases via Amazon.com"
4,h800,"good stuff, call button is a lil tougher to press that most motorola headsets, but nuthin to kill the coolness of the slider"
4,Good value for your money,"This earpiece easily sells for over $120 anywhere, and I was able to get it on here for $70...this is great! The battery lasts a long time and the convenience of being able to connect at the push of a button is a great feature. The Rapid Connect feature could probably use a little improvement because it doesn't connect as fast as the ""Rapid Connect"" name makes it sound, but it does what it needs to, and allows you to answer the call before it gets forwarded to your voicemail."
3,it serves it's purpose,"If i was to compare to the H700, i would pick H700. The slider is no quicker than the H700"
1,earpice does not work,"earpice does not work. came in mail on time. but earpiece does not work...had to call wireless emporium two times. on second call, they said they would refund me. which i got in 3 days back on my credit card."
4,Not bad,"I like this headset. It works as advertised. There are only 2 issues I have with it. 1. It gets really uncomfortable in your ear after a short period of time which makes you not want to use it; and 2.) Depending on where it's placed on your face, it is sometimes difficult for people to hear you if you talk at a normal volume. Both can be easily overlooked and overall, the product is one I'm happy with."
4,MOTOROLA H800 BLUETOOTH,"This is a very nice new style product, however, the one shipped to me was defective, and when I inadvertantly ended up calling MOTOROLA about a warranty replacement...When I did, MOTOROLA ended up sending me a different model, without a home charger, for which I had an older model that used the proper charger for the new one sent to me by Motorola...I really liked the H800 from the vendor, too...but the new replacement sent is good too!!"
1,AWFUL BOOK !!!!!! DON'T BUY IT!!!!,"Oh my God !!Bad, bad, bad book!!!!This book made me sick and a pounding headache!So poooorly written, very hard to read!!She also really should have been reported for neglecting her dog for so long, it breaks my heart into a million pieces.Shame on her!!I keep wondering what happened to that poor animal?I will put this junk in the garbage RIGHT NOW!!Please do yourself a favor and don't buy this book!!!"
1,Scary but poorly written,The author has a very scary tale to tell but it's quite a difficult read. I'm surprised that no one used spell check on the manuscript before it was published. The grammar is atrocious and truly takes away from the story. I find myself trying to figure out what she's writing. I wish someone had proofread this to at least correct all the misspellings. If I had realized it was self published I would not have purchased it.
2,not really to ghosty,well first off this book was written by a person who i think never wrote a book in her life. im not saying shes a bad writer you can just tell. to me the book this book has really little to do with the haunting but more to focus on strong family and faith.
1,YOU DON'T DESERVE TO HAVE A DOG!,The most horrific part of this book was what Cindy did to that poor animal. People like her don't deserve to have a dog. People like her also need an editor when they attempt to write a book. I hope I never find out she has pets again because I would report her to the Humane Society in a minute!
1,Worst Writing EVER,This author lacks rudimentary grammar and writing skills; her spelling is atrocious. No talent for prose whatsoever. A condemnation of our educational system. Don't spend your money.
2,It was ok,"This book wasn't so bad that I couldn't finish it, but it wasn't all that great either. The two star rating I decided on here is perfect since the book was just ok. Had the book been a long one I probably wouldn't have finished it; Since it was under one hundred pages it was really no big deal to read the whole story.I feel that Cindy exagerated on a lot of things that took place in her home, and honestly I have to wonder at her mental stabability. She said that she was evaluated by a mental health professional who said she was stable, but to what extent the testing went she did not elaborate on.I personally don't recommend reading this story when there are so many other really great ones about hauntings out there. But hey if your into reading about a psycho bible toting weirdo who can go a whole month without sleep don't let my opinion stop you!"
1,Review of Cindy Sarro's The Wall,"The story that this book tells could have been interesting. However the writer has no concept of grammar, punctuation, sentence structure or the use of active voice in writing. I realize that this book is a self-publish, but either the publisher or the writer's agent should have aided her in editing. The impact of her story is spoiled by the poor quality of the writing."
1,What a load of tripe!,"I guess if you can get past the numerous spelling mistakes and bad grammar, there IS a story in there somewhere - I just have not found it to be interesting or entertaining at all.The book needs to be proofread, and the author has the writing ability of a 10 year old at summer camp - and that is being generous. It's one big run on ""story"" with bad grammar and spelling packaged as a book, which has failed entirely to capture my attention for longer than 5 minutes.My advice is save your money and buy something else. If I could have rated it less than 1 star I would have."
1,A Horrifying story,"This book is very poorly written. I didnt enjoy the story at all. Reading this book, for me, was like reading the catcher in the rye. The author rattled and rambled through the whole story. I'm sure that it could have been a better book if she had someone to help her with the editing. I really can't say that I would reccomend this book to anyone. Read the back of the book and you have a good idea of what's in the book."
1,I cannot even finish reading this drivel.,"The one thing I cannot stand is a ""writer"" who cannot write. This is the worst book I have ever owned. I should have believed what the other reviewers said, but I thought the story would be scary enough to make up for the poor writing.No. It's not scary at all.This woman's story is hackneyed, incoherent, and not even remotely scary. Honestly, I think she had mental problems.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."
1,This Book Is A Waste of Paper--Awful!,"Do not waste your money on this one. I have read every true haunting book out there, and this one is the worst. So many errors in grammer, spelling, and word use that it was torture to keep reading. This book has no chapters--just 99 pages of blather about a ""ghost"" hitting the author. It is so bad that it has to be self published. No publishing house would touch this c--p! I repeat--don't waste your money--I took it to a used book store to recover at least a little of mine!"
1,"She left her dog tied up outside the ""haunted"" house when she left...","...and when she bothered to remember the poor animal's existence, she'd go feed and water her. Cindy, if you are out there and reading this I'd really like to know what happened to this poor dog that you abandoned."
1,Didn't See through this one,"Very disappointed and will be returned.The base, stem and mirror surround is nothing but plastic. For the price, the customer would expect a lot more."
4,Beautifully lilting violin with occasional pipes.,"Beautifully arranged, celtic based fiddle playing with accompaniment by renowned bagpiper Eric Rigler. I listen to this CD a surprisingly often and even use it to help my children get to sleep when they have trouble. I don't mean it has ""sleepy"" music, but it is so lyrical the kids get caught up in it and swept away. He makes his fiddle sing, like a mythical siren calling you home."
1,is good mount,if you have a plasma T.V and the light comes from different directions you can tilt the T.V so image is clear.
4,Geroge's review,"This game is a very decent shooter style game. It's fun to play. AI is not too bright but the game can be challenging. The story line is adequate for the game. I found the ""Sam Spade"" monologues sometimes overplayed. All in all I enjoyed the game."
2,Not great,Overall the toy was not easy to put together and once together fell apart. NOT Recommended
3,Circus Music Time,"Throw away the martinis and cavier and bring out the kool-aid and oreo cookies.None of these tracks are memorable at all.It's the sequel to the earlier ""That Happy Feeling' album - released on Cd as 'Safari Swing' - which at least had some more notable numbers.It's a waste of great talent: such a great band, playing tripe circus numbers which sound pleasant but makes a big band jazz fan want to cringe."
2,The Complete Storiesof Evelyn Waugh,"After having read a review of this book in the NYT, I am in complete agreement with the NYT reviewer's analysis. The plot and character are thin and predictable. With that in mind, the writer is great. He took a tired plot and character analysis and made the reading very interesting. I would watch the author for future literature contributions but this book was not worth the price."
2,Don Street's Knots,"I didn't rate this very highly. The whole production had an amateurish feel to it. There were even a couple mistakes in it. He tied the ""Double Sheet Bend"" knot incorrectly when he demonstrated it. Later on, he tied it correctly when using it with a Monkey's Fist. He tied a ""Rolling Hitch"" knot, but it appeared that he demonstrated the wrong pull direction on it when finished.I wish I hadn't bought it. This is one of those DVDs that should be in the ""bargain bin"" somewhere, in my opinion.Captain ""Q"""
3,Pretty good.,"Well, the toy is good from an interest level. But, honestly, I find this is a good example of how the Thomas wooden toys' quality has gone down hill. The large wooden block on the left side of the mountain is wood. But, the rest of the mountain is NOT solid wood. It is made out of a hardened version of cardboard. Basically, think wood pulp and glue. It is not solid wood, and it is not any where near as durable as solid wood. (Ours already shattered in one corner).The old Thomas toys used to be predominantly solid wood. They were durable. (Well, not the paint job, but the physical toy was durable). They have slowly become more and more plastic, and the solid wood has more often than not been replaced with this pulp-board.Pity."
5,Great starter set!,"My son loves trains and cars - so this set was a no-brainer. It has a train track that goes over a small bridge and a car track that runs under - so he can play with both trains and cars at the same time.As far as Thomas tracks go - I think this is one of the best at this price point. There is enough track (you can flip over the car track to reveal regular tracks on the other side) to play around and make your own designs. We bought this as a starter track and decided we didn't need more (especially since we have several other tracks - geotrax cars and chuggingon interactive).The only word of warning - the little brown ""boulder"" is actually really heavy - so if your child is prone to throwing objects, you might want to hide it. The ""house"" is on strings, so you can't lose the pieces and it does fall easily once the boulder hits it - but it isn't easy to use Thumper to push the button that will cause the boulder to drop. My 2 1/2 year old has figured it out, but uses his finger."
3,"Can write CD-R's at 2x on Win98SE, CD-RW's are not reliable","I have used the PCRW464K to write CD-R disks at 2X speed on Win98SE. I use it to backup my hard disk and to burn ISO images of Linux-Mandrake. Writing to CD-RW disks isn't reliable. In spite of this, I'm satisfied with the product I bought because of its convenient USB interface."
1,DON'T BUY SAVE THE AGGRAVATION,"If I could give it zero stars, I would. My unit came with a european power adapter and I live in the US. Support promised to send me the proper power adapter with in 24 hours, after I made 3 phone calls and spent about 45 minutes on hold. The second support person I spoke to was the most uncooperative and rude. She refused to let me speak to a supervisor or manager ""None are here."" I finally got to someone who I thought was going to help, which he didn't either. It has now been over 48 hours and no sign of it, no e-mail or phone call to explain any delay. It was like pulling teeth to get some help. I am returning my unit and purchasing a different brand altogether. Like I said, save your time, money and aggravation and buy the other brand first. I won't purchase another Philips product solely because if this is the help I get on a simple problem and it can't be resolved, what kind of help will I receive if I have a real problem?... Never again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Worked great for a while....,"I got this burner because I was looking for something inexpensive. I used it with my IBM iSeries ThinkPad. It took me forever to install and setup, but once I got it going it worked awesome for oh about a month and a half... All of a sudden it stopped working, crashes my computer all the time. Piece of garbage... Tech support is useless. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Mediocre product,"I bought this product because of its cheaper price compared to other major brands. However, the problem came in when I was trying to make a disc-to-disc copy and failed for numerous times. I then exchanged for another one and the same thing happened. I called the Tech Support twice and althought they were able to offer advices but both were pretty much the same and would not solve my problem. Tech Support was helpful but I had to wait a long time to get to them. So I guess they still need improvement. Anyway, I wouldn't recommend to buy it unless you can find another USB cdrw for a better price and performance."
2,"not so good, get a more expensive one!!","First, be sure you'll get the software (worth over $60) and the driver (hard to find the correct one). it was very hard to find and to install this machine to my win98. If you get errors with your software, try CDR Tools Front End (free and good) with 31MB fifo, DAO mode, burnproof. It is hardly compatible with win98 (you'll experience problems) but it works for cheap product standards. If you have money, go get a better one. And another note, Philips does not provide assistance with this product unless you pay them $19.95!!!!!!!!! i gave a 2 because it is working (for now. I probably won't restart my win98 ever again :) )"
1,TERRIBLE - DO NOT BUY,"This Product is terrible, do not buy...I purchased this product for my computer because of its USB port, and also because of its reasonable price. Don't let these things trick you into purchasing this item, it is not worth it. I have a very new laptop with easily all of the requirements, and with Windows 2000. I brought it home, and set up was easy, and then attempted to load the software, but I was unable to do so. So I followed the instructions to attempt to reload the software, and it still wouldn't work. Now if this wasn't enough, I attempted to uninstall the software, and was unable to do so using all of my removal programs. THIS PRODUCT IS A TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME, and I am writing this to try and save you the stress and trouble I had to deal with."
1,waste of time and money,"I understand this can work only on 95/98. If you are on Windows 2000, the CD creator software that comes with it cannot recognize the drive.THIS IS NOT MENTIONED IN THEIR SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS.."
1,Avoid it.. Breaks after 20 Cds and the worst Service Support,"DON'T BUY IT. The first problem I had was with the Easy CD Cretor (what a piece of...). I could not write a CD at 4x, only at 2x. I bought Nero Burning ROM and I could write at 4x.... but... The drive worked fine for 2 month, when I only successfully burned about 25 CDs. I lost about 20 more, due to a kind of Laser Power Failure error. One day it was working and the next it stoped working. I called Philips Customer support and they asked me to send them the drive for repairs (by UPS, 8 bucks). Then, after 4 weeks they sent me back the drive. Guess what?. The unit I received wasn't the same unit I sent them, because I compared the serial numbers and didn't match. I called Philips Support again and they told me that they send REFURBISHED unit in exchange for the damaged ones!!!. They DO NOT exchange with NEW units. Now I have another's guys CDRW drive, with a scratched and dirty enclosure, not like the new-alike one I sent them."
1,Poor customer service by Philips makes this a bad choice!,"I bought the previous generation Philips external CDRW and was shocked at how bad the customer service around this product was. At the time of purchase the support was bad, and to add insult to injury they did not offer drivers to allow the drive to be used with Windows 2000.So - unless you want to stuck with an obsolete product with no manufacturer support - don't buy this product."
4,Works fine for me,"I have a laptop PC running Win98SE, and this drive works just fine; exactly as advertised."
2,Play in one minute.....SERIOUSLY?!?,"I started out this dvd waiting to be impressed and was very disappointed. Dude, plucking one string can hardly be called ""playing"" - it does not constitute a warm-up or even tuning your bass. Your claim should have been if I can teach you how to play a note in under one minute then you can learn to play the bass. I had already begun my path to learning to play the bass so this point was moot to me. I bought this dvd to round out some of my other lessons but after viewing the first fifteen minutes of the dvd, I took it out of my player and decided it was a waste of my money. For those of you who aspire to be good bass players, try something like eMedia's Bass Method. It is a little more expensive but well worth it."
3,Highly informative but with reference to older Excel versions,"This book has a lot of valuable information about VBA and is very interesting to read. The big minus here is that all the references are pointing to older Excel versions (5/97, 2000, 2002). This makes the mental linking of the information to relevant sections in Excel 2007 or 2010 a bit tricky. Some of the details are also irrelevant in Excel 2010, since the feature might not exist anymore. VBA code itself, however, has not changed over the years, which is why the reader of this book can still acquire useful information through the many examples in the book.Overall I would say it is an ok buy but if you're looking for something more up-to-date, I would recommend you to look into the Excel 2010 VBA books."
3,Bulky and complicated,The radios are bulky and complicated and they use a proprietary battery.Also it's easy to inadvertantly turn the volume down and miss a call.Otherwise they are fine.
2,Works only in ONE mile range,I realized that 26 miles on opens space is not 26 miles in town. In reality this radio works poorly even a mile away outside in suburban area without no concrete building on a way or hills. Very disappointed... looks like it's just another looks end toy
1,Don't waste your money,"This product is not worth the price one is charged, this is nothing more than a child's toy! It didn't even get 1/3 of a miles reception, so don't waste your money!"
3,Don't let the waterproof fool you.,"I do a lot of kayak exploring and thought it would be a good idea to purchase radio's that not only have the NOAA Weather Alert, but also be waterproof in case of a mishap. The radio's work great, and the weather alert has really come in handy, but the waterproof feature leaves much to be desired. The radio only says it meets JIS4 specifications. What is JIS4? I have no idea, but I can say it's not much. My radio was accidently droped in the water for just a second but was never submerged. The battery compartment got wet and the display fogged up. This caused the radio to stop functioning properly. After a few minutes under the hair dryer, it seemed to get better, but now I realize waterproof to JIS4 specification must mean it can only withstand damp air. I will be much more carefull next time. Good sound, good features, but don't let the waterproof fool you."
3,Waterproof radio for bike to bike communication,"I purchased this radio mainly to be used as a way to talk to other motorcycles. Initially it was tricky to adjust the VOX as I had 2 - the one on the radio and the one on the bike communicator that the radio connects to. But once I got both adjusted it seem to work ok but I wouldn't say perfect. Two of my friends had Motorolas and those seem to work well, but those were not waterproof.One of the main reason I picked this model was that it is advertised as waterproof, but so far I did not get a chance to test that feature.Another thing to be aware is batteries. It seem to use them fairly quickly. On an all day ride I used almost 2 sets. Luckily it also uses AA but that can get expensive, and in my case carrying a bulky charger is not my first option. I wish they had a compact cell phone type charger available. Charging time also seems long at 12 hrs. I guess I'll get a set of rechargeable AA's.Radios seem to be well built and of good quality."
2,26 miles? Are you sure?,"I have buyed this 2 ways radio by reading the comments here in amazon. It doesn't worth the price, the max distance it can achieve a real comunication is like 2 or 3 miles. 26 miles may be in direct view and near a lake or something. I still prefer the Motorola radios!"
3,Poor battery life,"The radios seem OK, but just like most cell phones these days, the batteries don't hold a charge for very long. We ended up leaving them in the cradle all the time, or they will always be dead when you want to use them.The ability to switch to a weather radio quickly is very handy."
4,Motorcycle Radio,Features are numerous and work as expected. Using to communicate between motorcycles with good results and a range of about 1/2 mile on the FRS side. The headsets had to be replaced with the midland AVPH-1 and the reception has been very clear. Have not tried the GMRS side for distance but I'm sure it would be satisfactory. Other riders have purchased the same units with the same results. Would buy again.
4,Length of cord is nice,"I bought this item because I thought I was having problems with my wireless remote. As it turns out, it was a wiring problem in the boat. However, I do find myself using this quite often.I am accustomed to using the manual type that rocks back and forth, so the electronic version is a little difficult to use for me. I haven't had any problems with its use though. Everything works great. I have a dual console (fish/ski) and it is nice to be able to take this back to the driver's seat and maneuver the boat while the kids are fishing (as opposed to being at the front of the boat). I have had this product for about a year now."
5,min kota foot pedal,excellent results with this purchase. Item was clearly dsscribed and the service was very timely. Would definatly used these people again.
1,WORST Game of The YEAR,"This is the worst game of all time. The only reason anyone else should suffer and pay good money for this terible excuse for a game is if they have some sick devotion to MEN IN BLACK. I would not give this game to my worst enemy. PLEASE if you are reading this, STAY AWAY from this game."
3,Confusing but again essential copy,"These books cover one of the better SS units that historians have long overlooked. The contents I am not judging but my only problem is that the book has three chapters and each one is written in French, English and German. Which is very confusing as I am paying for well over half of the book that is useless to me, why not print the whole book as one copy, combining both volumes and printing them each in their perspective languages. Was it cheaper this way? Probably. Most of the photos are taken by members of the division which I usually don't mind but these aren't very interesting, plenty of shots of soldiers but little on its equipment if that's what you are looking for. Modern photos of the battlefield and actual uniforms found in the area are a nice touch."
3,It would be a great toy if it didn't come damaged!,"I got this for my daughter and it looked like someone had drawn on it:( The toy is great, though, and a friend of mine's wasn't damaged, so I guess it was just a little problem they had with mine."
1,FOR OLD COMPUTERS ONLY,"ALTHO THIS VEGAS STYLE GAME WAS A LOT OF FUN 15 YEARS AGO WITH MY OLD COMPUTER, I HAD TO RETURN IT THIS TIME AS ITS NOT COMPATABLE WITH TODAYS HARDWARE"
1,Big Rip-off,"If this Blu-ray sold for $1, I would still consider it a rip-off. The video looks like a poor conversion from a VHS tape. In no way is the original video hi-def quality. After a brief introduction by the doctor, the video instruction begins with several minutes of a man making a bed and a woman folding clothes. They are trying to make the point that the man should help the woman with housework to help make her feel more comfortable. The video spends an inordinate amount of time to make obvious points.The quality of the ""instruction"" is also VERY poor. There is sparse narration with no real instructional value. Directions, such as ""Begin by gently rubbing the top, bottom, and sides of the feet using both hands at once."" These is no description of real technique. The video is shot from across the room, so it is difficult to learn any techniques from watching the action. There are many other videos (DVD and Blu-ray) and all are a better value than this one. Don't waste your money."
1,"BORING, disorganized, poorly filmed, almost impossible to watch","Really bad. I am seriously suspicious of the ""rave reviews."" Whoever made this DVD has poor video skills, to put it mildly. The camera just drifts around and some of the time you can't even see what is happening. Very cheap production and it shows in every scene. You aren't going to learn much here. I take massage seriously and this is insult to the serious student. Trust me, you aren't going to learn anything that will ""turn on"" a woman here,"
1,this is not blu ray quality,"First of all, this shouldn't be offered on blu ray : it is VHS tape quality.Secondly, it is way to expensive : buy the dvd instead and try to find it second hand; don't pay more than 10 and i'm being generous.Thirdly,it's a cheap amateurkind production and most of all boring : this is massage for the shy."
2,"Low quality, ok for someone who's never received a massage","I've had a few massages, and there was nothing in this video that was new for me. It was OK to reinforce some basic principles, but we had to put it on 60x speed to be able to make it to the end. This would be a good intro for somebody who has never received a professional massage."
3,It's amateur at best.,"My girlfriend and I just finished watching this DVD. The most annoying thing was listening to the same royalty-free stock music (one individual song) over and over for an hour and a half, lasting about 3 minutes per play. They give you a little break of silence here and there, but then bring it all back. Perhaps there's some hidden comedic quality about it, because we found ourselves both laughing at the fact that we started to get mad about it.Otherwise, the direction in the video is decent, but not very detailed. Better than nothing, I suppose... but certainly not worth the money in my opinion. You'd be better off with a cheap book, or just ""winging it"" with a bottle of oil and tell yourself to make a full body massage last over an hour."
1,NOT HD & barely instructional,"looks like it was shot originally on a shoulder VHS recorder. fast forwarding through the video, it appeared to offer no special technique or insight- the only thing approaching sensual is the lady lying on a bed with only a towel covering her (not the woman on the cover). it should not be released on BRD (misleading), and the DVD should be less than $5. I consider this purchase wasted money, as there was nothing to learn from this video and quality was far less than implied."
1,I hate it! NEVER BUY THIS!,"ALL THIS MOVIES SENSUAL COUPLES MASSAGE NEVER BUY ! NEVER! It is the worst quality for Blu-ray, it is home made video an is like on VHS not blu-ray! Music terrible! Boring Boring Boring! It is even not sensual massage!!!! I return it!!! The worst ever!"
2,Rusted,"This was a nice lock set while it lasted. Both locks are completely rusted over from head to toe after about two years of being exposed to the weather. I expected rust on the lock shafts where the metal rubs against metal, but even the heads of the locks are rusted over. The chrome finish is not very durable and doesn't protect against rust. If you take the locks off after every use and store them indoors, then these will work great for you. But if you're like me and prefer to keep your trailer locked at all times to help prevent theft, then you'll probably want to look else where. I'm now looking for a set of stainless steel locks."
5,Everything you need...,"This product fit what I was looking for. It fits my hitch as well as my trailer perfectly. The key is easy to use and the receiver is easy to remove and attach. No nonsense product, solid craftmanship."
1,Junk Science at its worst,"The number of logic fallacies, unquantified opinions and illogical rants is shocking for a book that is about other myths.Example, some of the most egregious examples:Page 37: The Myth: ""Junk food causes ill health"". The Fact: ""There is no such thing as food that is bad and food that is good for you."" Really, all food is equally good for you?Page 48: The Myth: ""Non-Organic foods are covered in harmful pesticides"". The Fact: ""One of the pesticides deemed safe by organic produces carriers a warning that it is harmful to fish.""A proper book would look to determine if the myth is true or not (and that is what I was hoping for.) But instead, the fact does not refute the myth, doesn't provide if organic foods are good or bad, and is irrelevant to the discussion.Time and time again, the authors avoid meaningful debate and rather simply rely on name calling and off the cuff opinions."
5,Excellent Recording,"I bought this album after seeing Athena Tergis in ""Riverdance"" on Broadway. She is extraordinarily talented, and this album reflects that.""Journey Begun"" features some light pieces, and some dramatic pieces, and some in-between. All of them are great examples of gifted fiddle-players who make the music seem natural and easy. The album as a whole is original, innovative, and enjoyable."
5,A-1 grouse hunting resource,"I have a library with every book I can get my hands on related to grouse hunting. There are resources specifically on Ruffed Grouse, guns, gunfit, shooting techniques, and every other aspect of the sport. The grouse hunting guides tend to get a read once or twice and then stay on the shelf. Not so with Walrod's book. It is the one hunting guide I have found myself referencing repeatedly. He has great comparative statistics and charts for locating birds depending on the conditions. It is a very enjoyable read and an excellent resource for the dedicated grouse hunter"
5,Great item - Great price,This product was better than I could have hoped for. It was shipped very quickly. It was a surprise when it showed up on our doorstep in less than a week after ordering. I would recommend this wall mount EVERY time.
5,nice compromise between pure flat mount and articulating mount,"Not much to say here, but this was easy to install, seems sturdy enough, and has a nice tilt function."
4,"Abby, we want more; come ye back.","I bought ""Crossing to Scotland"" as a gift for someone who'd enjoyed the live concerts. The effect has been to make me look like I have very good taste.Newton's musical skills surpass the all-too-common format in which allegedly Celtic music becomes a sort of New-Age easy listening. (People near Washington D.C. know better; Newton's cello has become an integral part of the National Geographic Society's Scottish Christmas concerts, along with Bonnie Rideout's violin, Al Pettaway's guitar, and Maggie Sansone's hammered dulcimer, and the mandatory bagpiper.This album deserves much wider play. As for Newton, my only question is why she waited so long to produce this CD. (On the other hand, it was certainly worth the wait.)"
3,Wow. Same thing happened to me.,"Had it for about 18 months. Base stopped charging the handset. Changed the battery - tried to charge it for 24 hours - but the base wasn't charging that either. Called AT&T, they walked through a little hardware-reset trick by pulling ALL the power sources for 2 minutes and then putting them back. Didn't work. They apologized and offered a discount towards a replacement phone to be shipped to me - but I could not wait that long. Since other people are seeing the same thing happen, I suppose it is not a very durable phone."
2,Good while it lasted but it died too soon,"Maybe I expected too much from a $35 phone. It worked fine for about 18 months but then the base quit charging the phone. I replaced the battery, thinking it was just that the battery had failed. Charged the new battery for 12 hours as directed, but the new battery quit within a couple of days. I noticed then that the charger light was flickering and not steady. Checked all the connections; everything was tight. I will avoid AT&T phones in the future."
5,Great Phone for the price,I have been looking for a codrdless phone with a lighted keypad. There are not alot to pick from. I saw this phone on sale at my local Target store. The handset was the right weight and the color was nice too. Plugged it in and used it right away. I don't have the static that the other reviews said they have. I get great reception and its really clear. Try it . If you don't like it return it. I know I won't be returning mine.
1,It's actually a 900Mhz phone,I don't own the phone but I work for a Wireless ISP and had the opportunity to see it on my scope. It uses a 915Mhz carrier that doesn't change freqs when you hit the channel button.I'm not sure why it's labeled 2.4Ghz...
3,Worked good for 3 years,"Real sturdy at&t phone- which is why I always choose at&t phones. Hardware is sturdy, always a clear reception, a good phone for the price, had all the basics I was looking for. I live alone in an apartment- so it was all I needed. However, I've had it for 3 years now, and the display (that shows caller id, and my address book, and calls missed) is now not working properly. Huge strips of it no longer work, so I can't identify and phone numbers or words on it. After all, I must get a new phone. I like my phones to last just a LITTLE longer than 3 years.... Was good while it lasted."
2,Fone Failure,"I have owned this phone for a few years, and it worked well, but then the battery started failing to charge. I replaced the battery only to discover that the new battery would not charge either. The light on the base flickers, just as with other people's descriptions. Ultimately these cheap Chinese made phones are a waste of your money"
1,Popping and interference worse than 900MHz!!!,"I purchased this phone and knew that I'd be returning it after the first phone call I made on it. Try as I might, I could not get it to stop making those annoying popping sounds, and in some areas of my home the interference was so bad I actually got a dial tone during my conversation! I returned it to the friendly Target store nearby and opted for the GE 500 GHz Analog Cordless instead, which is a DREAM COME TRUE!!! Splurge and spend the extra $15 on the GE and get crystal clear reception instead!"
1,this tool damages the frame,deep gouges in the wood when using this tool. had better luck just hammering in the v-nails. not worth the money.
5,good,this product is very good. excellent. I recommend it. will not regret your purchase. muy buen producto y funciona muy bien
4,Logan Studio Joiner,The Logan Studio Joiner is very easy to use. The cd that is sent with it for educational purposes is great. As long as you follow the instructions the joiner works well. Once in a while the mechanism that will seat the v-nails will stick a little but it is easy to adapt to it.
2,Joiner is cheaply made and not accurate,"Logan describes this frame joiner as ""economical"" but it is better described as cheap. It is a semi-adequate unit if you can buy it on sale and you don't require precisely made frames. The error tolerance is about 1/16 inch. There is no easy way to stablize the frame when flipping it.The customer service support at Logan Graphic is very poor. I bought a V-groover that proved to be factory defective and per Logan Graphic instructions sent the unit to them - their response has been customer nonservice. Nearly two months and ten emails later I have yet to receive a replacement unit."
3,A little lonely,This is not my favourite Kaempfert album but it is still very good. I particularly like the title track One Lonely Night and a track titled Maltese Melody. The other tracks are all delightful and are a testament to the skill of this man and his excellent orchestra. It is even more amazing when you consider that he wrote or co-wrote most of the tracks on this album as he does for most of his other albums. Nice album.
2,Best used as recycle waste!,"Well, It worked ""OK"" for about a year. All of the sudden it stopped working after the warranty was completed. Did not work well with virus software installed and never create CD-ROMs at the max speed. Overheated and crash the computer several times before it completely died. Buy something else!!!!!!"
5,Great Unit!,This is my first CD-RW. It isn't the fastest but I was looking for a value. I had it up and running on the first boot. I used the included Adaptec Easy CD Creator software and had my first music CD completed within an hour of opening the box. It burned 12 tracks in about 15 minutes. The only minor glitch was the included installation CD failed to load. I don't know what is on it because I didn't need to use it. All in all I am extremely happy with it and can recommend it highly.
1,never buy it if you do not want to waste your money and time,not even an one star product - a third class product from a first class company(!). It worked initially in Windows 98SE. But once I tried XP - problem started - the customer service seems to be from North Pole - worthless and rude. After weeks hardwork - it suddenly started working again before gone dead for ever (within one and half years of slow bad performance).
1,wrong product,"i got a wrong product, i paid for the 360 red 3.4 ounce and got the 360 1.7 ounce and the bottle wasn't sealed"
1,There's this cool new technology...,"... it's called a leash. Or a fence. How about keeping your pet safe the responsible-- not to mention cheap-- way.I've been a volunteer at a no-kill animal shelter for 5 years, and I'm still amazed at the lack of guardianship people show for their pets. So your dog has this $350-dollar doodad on its neck. It's not going to keep it from running out into the street and getting hit by a car, or picked up by somebody who wants to use it for dog-fighting bait or sell it to a lab (yes, these things happen-- often).Have some sense, people. This is ridiculous."
1,Totally worthless,"This product keeps changing home addresses; none of which are the address I typed in the initial field. It does not stay charged so that it is actually able to function as advertised if you are gone from home any length of time and you put your dog in a yard. Additionally, gravity takes it down to the lower neck area in common use so that when the dog is doing normal dog things, the device sinks downward so that the antenna is pointing toward the ground. The pictures are misleading. We tried all of the advise the company gave us. It's just not a device that works when and where you need it to work. It was a lot to invest to have this many problems."
2,Didn't Work for Us,"I ordered this product and received it shortly after. I ended up sending it back. The unit was very large (much larger than my cell phone) and rather heavy and cumbersome. I have a really, really big dog (130 lbs), and I thought it was too large to leave on his collar. I can't imagine what a person with a smaller dog would do. Also, the ""snap guard"" that attaches it to the collar won't work on a martigale style collar (the collar must have a buckle). The optional weather resistent pouch option will not fit on a collar over 1"" wide, and is only secured with velcro. In any circumstance where my dog was lost, that would not make me feel that it would stay attached. So, until they make this smaller/lighter and have a more reliable way to attach it to a wider variety of collar types, it's not something we would consider using."
4,To gloss over,"This is a nice book for the price, rather to gloss over the topic, not to study.Good looks, well bound, not complete, but then I didn't expect it to be so at this price or size."
1,A disappointment,"This CD-ROM is not much of a bargain. It consists simply of several Adobe Acrobat files, which are scans of two books published in the early 1900's, as well as a Bible atlas from the same period. The maps are terribly hard to read because the scans are not very clear.I returned this product for a refund."
1,STAY AWAY!,"This has half the amount of vitamins despite having the same number of capsules. Instead of taking 3 per day, now you have to take 6. It is not at all obvious. Stay away and get the non VCAPS version.Nature's way is pretty clever I guess. I think most people would search for Alive 90 count vitamins. The boxes also look identical except for minor cosmetic difference.I also talked to them about this and their customer service was rude. I would have expected a natural good company to be more customer oriented but whatever. It tells a lot about a company when they do not have a working website, make you wait a long time on the phone and then keep cutting you off and basically do not care what you say."
1,Alive! Whole Food energizer Multi-Vitamin,"I have purchased this multi-vitamin for many years now and have had no complaints. I recently received from Amazon a new bottle, and the formulation has been changed. The taste is terrible to me. I never had a problem with the original taste. Perhaps others will not agree. I struggled for weeks trying to make myself take the vitamins but finally realized I would enjoy a different brand. I wish Nature's Way would put it back the way it was."
5,Feel great!,By far these are the best vitamins I've found. My energy level has increased and I have an overall sense of well being. I would highly recommend Alive! to everyone!
5,Alive Multivitamin,The Alive Multivitamin is my usual vitamin supplement and I found the prices on Amazon to be attractive and the selection was good and varied. Shipping was prompt with good packaging. I intend to continue to order.
2,Great Ingedients But Gave Me Very Bad Heartburn,"I agree that the ingredients in this product are plentiful but after starting and stopping them to make sure that it was indeed these that gave me real bad heartburn, I had to stop taking them and am now taking a liquid product that suits me just fine and should even be more absorbable. No matter how good the product if you cannot tolerate it then no point."
3,Couple issues,"This is a nice vitamin since it is all vegetarian, but couple cons:a) hard to swallow - big tabletsb) you need to take three of them for a full dose. Not a big deal and maybe a plus since you can get equal doses through out the day but a pain to swallow three of these if you want to get the full dose at once.c) This company also has a gel capsule one. They do not tell you but with the vegetarian gel ones, you need to take 6 of them. So even though it looks cheaper per count (180 tablets vs 180 gels), you would be getting half. I think that is somewhat deceptive as I never had to take 6 of any medicine/supplement to get the full dosage. They were also rude on the phone when I tried to explain thus I am looking for another natural/vegetarian supplement."
1,Caused health Concerns,"Since starting these vitamins about a month ago, I have noticed irregular heartbeats & rectal bleeding. I even went to the dr two weeks ago to see what was going on. I stopped taking the vitamins & my symptoms went away. I started taking 1 a day for the past 3 days, and the irregular heartbeats and rectal bleeding have returned. These are serious side effects. I am calling the company tomorrow to file a complaint."
1,Wrong Order,I received the Max Potency (which is cheaper) instead of this one which I ordered and it will be too troublesometo return it all the way from Singapore! Disappointed.
2,only 15 servings on mine,"CAREFUL mine got here last week and only has 15 servings at 30 vcaps. The seller apparently left amazon.I will stick with Adam by Now foods. Has 30 servings and better standardized ingredients like, grape seed, saw palmetto. I read someone complaining about the retinol (sp?) in the vitamin A portion on this being dangerous. Honestly the fruits and veggies aren't more than something to write on the bottle. I can more out of 1 bite of broccoli. Selenium could be of a higher servings as well but thats just knit picking. Oh well... can't always get good service on a market website. 95% I've been thrilled from buying online.....but there will always be one time you get shafted."
1,almost purchased but changed my mind,Product does not mention being gluten-free which is critical AND it contains stearate which is very questionable. There is a lot of controversy about stearate and I don't want to take chances with my health.
5,Alive-Tablets,Gives you lots of energy. I have taken all brands of vitamins and this is the first brand that gives me a lift and does not make my stomach upset.
5,Alive gummie vitamins for adults,"I got these vitamins for my teenage son who is 14. He doesn't eat great ( hardly any fruits or veggies ) so that's why I ordered these. They have 26 fruit & veggies in them. He also likes the taste of them, so they've been a good daily supplement for him. I don't have to harp on him to take them. We will keep purchasing them."
5,Great product for a resonable price.,I use these vitamins for a replacement for a very pricey product sold by 'dealers' in a marketing pyramid that costs about $50/month. These have worked very well to keep my immune system strong and energy level up.
5,I love these!!,I love all the ingredients these vitamins have. Not to mention that they are plant based and not chemical based. I'm really happy that Amazon offers a 15% discount when you select the automated shipping and they show up right when your previous bottle runs out!
5,Great Vitamins,"I have been taking these for about 6 months and they work great! Can tell a huge difference in energy levels, and they don't cause stomach issues that some chemical vitamins can. The ingredients are from whole food, so it is just like eating. Would recommend this for anyone!"
2,Had know idea what it was about.,"I watched this movie because someone else recommended it and said it was ""profound"". What was profound about it for me is how eastern, mystical, religious thought packaged for western society via a movie can come across as it so often does. Touching, yet missing the mark when it comes to truth. Nevertheless, the acting was good and there were some touching scenes trying to proselytize the audience with its message."
3,I liked it but,"I found patts of it, so unbelieveable. FOr instance she was in her late twneties having been in a convent since she was sixteen. She was a virgin but an expert at sex- from being taught by a woman for a few weeks? come on. Yes, she was crying in the middle of it,,but I would of enjoyed it more if she wasn't so perfect, and she was at least a little bit hesitant. . Who is perfect thier firswt time? It was just silly to me."
3,Puddy Speaks,"That doesn't look like True Love to me. This is a really freaky movie that looks it was shot on the days' off from the actors real jobs. The cast includes John Glover, Simon Callow, Jennifer Tilly and Eric Roberts in small roles. I watched it because I love Puddy. I think the sets and costumes were intentionally designed to be hideous to be true to the characters' backgrounds and that self-regarding mysticism by Asian tourist guides is deservedly disdained (""Bardo."") I enjoyed it but it is definitely visually/ aesthetically gross and the entire movie is obviously intended to be an uncomfortable experience. The main characters end up bald-headed by the end of the movie. And Marie Matiko, Nicole Bilderback and Mrs. John Cho from Sorority Boys look like sisters."
5,unexpected quality,"At first the flick seems like a cheap reality show filmed with a hand held camera but the substance of the film gets better half way thru and toward the end. Ultimately, it is quite an emotional trip and the performance by Marie Matiko makes this a totally awesome experience."
5,Great!,I have not had any problems. I know several others who also have this same bag (some for significantly longer than me) and they haven't had any problems either. It has a lot of space for it's size and is easy to use. I have pretty bad back problems which made me get this bag and I'm grateful that I did. I'd recommend it to everyone looking for a low-price but good quality bag.
4,Not bad for the price,This was not a bad item for the price and what I'm using it for. There could be a little more room in each of the compartments but I've managed to get all I need for work to fit in this one bag. I love the handle and the convience of the wheels...however it is a pest trying to get the case down hill. It takes some working but I manage. Overall I like the product and am glad I bought it.
5,Nice Item,"At first I thought I was going to be unhappy with the item because it looked bulkier in person than online. But after using it I found I was very happy with it. It rolls & takes corners so smoothly & quietly, and I am able to easily hang another smaller bag from the handle as well. It's very light & easy to handle which is what I wanted being a petite female with arthritis. All the zipper compartments are an added plus and are plenty spacious. My laptop nests in the padded compartment with velcro closure perfectly. I recommend it."
2,Not what was expected.,"This bag is a royal pain. Nine out of 10 times the telescoping handle would not extend to its full range causing much frustration on my part. I expected it to be a much smaller bag, but it was the same size as all of my other computer bags. The wheels also caused some problems but were not near as frustrating as the handle was. I would not recommend this bag to anyone."
2,"Nice, but...","I purchased this due to a back injury and the need to transport teaching materials. I walk 8 blocks to the bus each day. The functionality of the case is great and the narrow wheels may work fine in airports, but they wear very quickly on concrete sidewalks. The narrow profile concentrates the weight onto a small contact area. My bag experienced serious wheel wear in only two weeks of use. Still, I liked the case and contacted Kensington about replacement wheels. They do not sell replacement parts, and the wheels are non-standard. Not wanting to have to replace the case every 6 weeks, I returned it and purchased a case that was not as functional, but that had standard roller-blade size wheels.If you are limited to using this case on smooth flooring or occasional sidewalk use, it is fine."
1,Poor Quality Roller Carrying Case,I have used this case for 30 days and the wheels are already wearing out. The telescoping arm is a joke. It does not stay up when you want it to and it will not receed when trying to lower the handle. Very poor quality.
1,Great Design ruined by cheap materials and bad quality,"I love the design of this bag, for my purposes it is just about perfect. HOWEVER the materials used in it's construction have to be the cheapest on the planet. The telescopic arm wobbles, and feels like will break any second. Not only is the fabric cheap, thin and crinkly, it smells like horrible chemicals. The smell took about 5 minutes to permeate my entire office.I know someone who had the previous version, which has an almost identical design and they warned me that the new ones just did not hold a candle to the older ones. It seems that Kensington decided to re-factor the bag with cheaper materials and processes to make more money and in the process they ruined what by all accounts was a awesome laptop roller.Until Kensington returns to the old materials, construction and design, I would stay away from this bag."
2,Weakness is telescoping arm,"I liked this product enough to buy a second one after the handle of my first one broke. But, when my second one had the same problem with the telescoping handle from day 1, then I just sent the second one back."
2,Handle issues,"Had this bag 4 months with daily usage.. the button on top of the handle doesn't always push the rubber stoppers in, if forced eventually the rubber disappears and the handle doesn't stay open. Plus the handle wobbles to the right and left. The wheels are nice, but the bag is a little large to go under any airline seats easily. I did get it in the overhead bins nicely even on the embraer aircraft (commuter jet)-- not sure if these folks will replace the bag."
3,Good bag,Make sure you board first if you own this bag. It's a good bag but if you travel on small regional jets it barely fits in the overhead and will absolutely not fit under some of the seats. Check into the Kensington 62430. It is smaller.
2,Not the bag it used to be,"I should have listened to other reviewers. A friend has this identical-looking bag, but bought it years ago. There is definitely a difference between his and mine. His has held up very well, it's sturdy, the arm doesn't wiggle and it's clearly taken abuse and is still in great shape. Mine looks good, has a good amount of room for all the files and two computers I travel with, but after only a few weeks I'm worried the arm is going to break off. I'll continue to use it for the time it holds up, but am saving up for a much better bag."
2,Arm is hard to retract,"The bag is a great size and the wheels work great, but the telescoping arm is a b*tch to retract. You really have to ram it down aggressively, and oftentimes I can't get the bottom one to go down at all."
4,Kensington 62348 Contour Roller Carrying Case',"This is my second Kensington Roller... It is a great durable bag in the past .. Seems like the construction is similar, but time will tell if the zippers will hold up.. Looks and feels cheaper.. Functional now ... Will have to wait and see... Not sure why the change... Hopefully the reasoning was not purely cost... Good product."
4,useable but quality declining,"I just bought my 3rd one of these. Every time I buy one Ireview the other products out there, but this one has exactly the combinationof pockets and compartments that I need.I agree with other reviewers, the quality has gone down.Compared with the bag I bought 2-3 years ago, the ""ballisticpolyester"" has replaced the leather that was acrossthe front. What really bugs me is the extendable handle.On all of my bags it's what has gone first. It won't extendreliably any more when I'm going down a ramp, so I have towalk it in front of me, clumsy. Or it won't retractall the way, hard to handle at an airplane door.This time I ripped out their computer sleeve and replaced it witha laptop sleeve (mine's an old Targus, I can't find the modelon Targus website) that has a strap, so I can pull the laptop +sleeve out of the Kensington.Bottom line: useable product; for the price I can afford a newone every few years; could be more robust."
1,not the best investment,"Unfortunately, this was not the best investment for me. I had to use this bag for a couple of months( about twice a week to get things around a couple of blocks) and the wheels on this bag got worn out so quickly i was not able to use the bag again after first months of try. the wheels now making the most loud noise on the pavements and floors. So I can't use it any longer for my job or travel.the overall appearance of this bag is fine and it the inserts and compartments are great though. It has the issues with the wheels durability."
4,Almost right,"This is a quality rolling bag. It's thinner than all the ones with room for storing clothing, which is desirable. For business use, you want just the basics. I have just two quibbles. First, there is a row of ""loops"" for pens and pencils. Every one of them is too short for a pen or pencil, so the pens will just fall out if the bag is not kept upright. Really dumb design. Also, the compartment for the laptop doesn't zip around far enough to open fully, so it's clumsy to take out or insert the computer. Other than those issues, this is the best laptop rolling case I've found, and I have looked around. Incidentally, the bag looks much better in person than in the picture. The fabric is stronger than anticipated, too."
4,Great for the Business Traveler,"I greatly enjoy this notebook case! It's hard to find one that fits a 17"" notebook computer these days.Pros:Lots of space, and its well organized.Telescoping handle, navigates well through airports.Easy on hand grip, distibutes weight well and is comforable.Cons:Strap doesn't support weight well, begain to tear after one week of use.All in all this is the best traveling case I've had."
4,Roller Carrying Case has lots of pockets,"This case is really nice however, I thought I was buying a black case and it came in as a dark green. In all the pictures it looked black and I didn't even think to check the color of it. Oh well, all else is good with the carrying case. I serves the purpose."
2,Finger pincher. Noting like starting out so many mornings with a nice pinch.,It ain't no Samsonite. Little pincher. I could be partly to blame. I use it sparingly as nothing starts of a bad day like being bitten by this item.
4,Very good design...with a caveat,"I find this an excellent bag. All of my laptops (12-17 inch) fit in the foam lined storage, and there is sufficient space for files and papers, wireless mouse, extra battery, ... a lot of stuff.The roller works beautifully...almost no effort to roll the bag fully stuffed around.However, as another reviewer noted, the telescoping handle should be another length or even two long. I am over 6' and it is almost impossible to drag the bag behind you without your shoe kicking the bag...you really have to drag it on the right side to avoid kicking it."
2,"Great design, quality terrible!","I bought this without seeing one. The reviews were mixed, so I thought it would be OK to buy. Plus, the Kensington name I recognize from other computer parts I have purchased.Well, the bag is nicely designed, but the quality is terrible. From the zippers to the telscopic handle it's made cheaply. Plus, the narrow plastic wheels are super noisy on cement. You'll sound like you are riding a cheap skateboard into the building!I would have paid more and bought a different one had I known all this in advance."
4,Smooth but bulky,"I thought it was going to be a lot smaller. The dimensions it states on the specs don't seem to be anywhere close to what it is. Which turned out ok for me since I keep my laptop and at least 2 casebooks in it at all times, but its overkill if you just need to bring your laptop, you are better off just carrying it than manuevering the bag around the aisles and whatnot."
5,Suprisingly great bag!!,"This review is for the Kensington 62348 Contour Roller Carrying Case.After buying 2 other bags and being very disapointed with the size and quality, I finally found the bag for me. Every inch of this bag is available for use. Even the back, where the handle goes down, there are pockets next to the handle. Instead of empty space!! You can even put a magazine or files in there. The handle is sturdy, and long enough for me at 5' 11"". No problems with my heels geting hit. I was cautious about the clearance because of other reviews, but I haven't have any problems. If I ever need to replace this bag, can't see that I would with the warranty, I would replace it with this one again. By the way, not a carry on for the plane. Too big."
4,"Pretty good, but not perfect","I'm generally happy with the bag. It holds a lot of stuff, and there are plenty of pockets, ""cargo nets,"" and zippers for stashing the variety of things I need when I travel. The biggest problem I've had is that the retractable handle sometimes doesn't extend all the way. When it doensn't, I have to push it all the way down again in order to get it to extend. It's a pain, but not horrible. The curved foam strip on the back between the wheels is also coming off, and needs to be glued back on. This shouldn't happen in a bag I've only had for 3 months."
5,Great roller and not too heavy to carry for widescreens,This is the best carrier that I have found for a widescreen laptop. Rollers and handle are very sturdy and it is not too heavy like some others.
5,Great rolling laptop bag,Bought this laptop case for my husband and I and then bought another for my parents. Rolls easily. Is balanced well. Has lots of room. Reasonable price. Great buy. Thanks!
4,No more back ache,"I purchased this case after I was injured in a car accident. It is hard for me to carry a heavy bag full of files,17 inch laptop, and books now because of the stress on my neck and shoulders. In fact, I tried to be fashionable at conference last month and used my Dell bookbag instead. Boy was I sorry. This bag more than delivers all it promises and that others have written about. However, it gets 4 stars instead of 5 because the mesh used for the pockets (mouse, power cable, water bottle etc) is so easily ripped. I try not to put anything in these holders if I can help it. Otherwise, the remaining material/parts of the case are pretty durable."
2,not for me,"That Kensington Roller Carrying Case was my mistake. I wanted a rolling brief case for office and class use. This is a monster case more suitable as luggage for a plane trip. Too many pockets, too much padding, maybe needed for trips but not for light duty going to class holding folders and a few books. It is well designed and well built but not for my needs. It has been retired awaiting a long plane trip while I still carry my stuff in a brief case. I am still looking for a bare bones rolling case with maybe two compartments and no padding or multiple small pockets."
3,Great for big laptops!,"I'm very happy with my purchase of this case. I have a monster 17"" laptop that would not fit in my old laptop cases or my laptop backpack. This case fits just fine under airplane seats, but it is a bit tricky if you try to roll it up the airplane aisle. My only complaint is the handle. It's a bit rickety in that it sways back and forth and doesn't always keep the case going exactly straight (hence the difficulty with the airplane aisle since it just barely fits between the seats) and it's sometimes difficult to collapse back down. So far, it hasn't been an issue and I hope it remains so."
4,would be perfect if insert was slightly larger,"This thing is really handy. The storage spaces are all very usable for what they were designed for. It rolls easily and the handle opens and closes well. My 17"" HP (widescreen) just barely fits the insert however and I'd call it 5 stars if it were just a little larger."
3,Spykee,"Awesome concept, not the easiest thing to put together. It still works, however my son does not use it. Wanted to use it remotely while on vacation however the configuration of the IP address, etc. is not for beginners. Had an IT person check it out and he could probably have done it from his house, but I gave up. Again NOT an easy product to assemble, there are many many pieces. Unless you have a lot of time to devote to this robot, the cost is not worth the hassle. It sits in its box now."
2,Battery doesn't charge,"Bought this from Woot but the battery never held charge. Charged overnight on 'OFF' and also tried charging overnight on 'ON' positions. Comes to life while on the cradle but ones the connection is made via wifi, it keeps giving me the status of 'Charging' or 'battery low'. Whenever it leaves the cradle via the forward button on the software, it dies and the connection is lost.I have read a lot of reviews with the same issue.I'm trying to search for a replacement battery."
1,Avoid the hassle,"Construction is terrible, provided screws don't hold anything, takes hours to put together. Has no manual, must be downloaded from the website, does not connect to a Mac even though the Mac finds it in its airport and the telephone help line is always busy, prompting to call another day. After having spent over 20 hours trying to connect it...I finally gave up. We never saw it in action, but after reading some trouble shooting blogs I realized, that this was a mistake."
2,Erector Spykee,"Erector Spykee is a hyper inflated toy that is hardly worth the small mental effort to put together a few indistinct mechanisms that resemble dumb cranes or hulking robotics. You can't do much with it, it's expensive and math and science lovers rave about it day in day out. It's overrated by everyone who has purchased one and there's no evidence that this is any more productive for the brain than a pile of bricks. This toy is pushed by the elitist robotic sub-culture who think they are the wave of the future.If you are using it for kids, you're better off just getting a block set, an army set, and a classical Erector Building Set. You'll even have money left over to get a bike.This is a robotic size piece of junk. I wasted my time and money on this."
5,Amazing Robot - got it for christmas,"This Robot was is amazing. As soon as I got it I loved it . It took me all of New Year's Eve and some of new years day. It has over 200 parts . Once I Went to [...] and downloaded the manual and console I just had to charge it and then I was ready to go! When I first turned it on it beeped and then I started to drive it . As I examined the different things I could do , I noticed the sound effects , they were amazing. The wa-ha-ha-ha!!! was one of my favorites. Some mp3 drag and drop difficulties and some difficulty with the VOIP phone ( could hear the other person but they couldn't hear me) , but all in all, it was a wonderful robot ."
4,Disturbingly current,"Epicenter DVD: A Video DocumentaryThis DVD is surprisingly current even though it was made several years ago. People mentioned and interviewed in this dvd, like the current Israeli leader, and the current Iranian leader are still in power or have just regained power. This DVD is worth watching even if you find Biblical Prophecy tricky or hard to follow because the political events covered are still going on. A great way to learn about the Middle East through ""the third lens"" of the Bible."
2,just wasn't what I thought,"I took the pills as described on the label, but after a few days the pills started upsetting my stomach real bad and made me nauseas."
2,Almost useless.,"I am researching planting food plots and creating habitat. This book only restates what you see in the magazines, so it's not really worth buying. I didn't find much for useful information."
4,Dirty Little Secret,"The dirty little secret of travel writing is that in order for a story to be funny something bad has to happen. Editor Kate Chynoweth is well aware of this fact and has selected tales with terrible twists written with wit and charm that demonstrate the point. The writing in this collection is a cut above the average collection of women's travel tales that I have read. However, not all of these tales are amusing. I was horrified by the Erica J. Green's story about an ant phobia brought to life in Africa. But, most are quite lighthearted. I found some of the one-liners in A Useful and Comprehensive Travel Dictionary for Girls by Buzzy Jackson laugh out loud funny.[...]"
1,"Muddy, muddy, muddy","The songs are great. But these particular recordings are terrible, even considering their vintage. If you want to hear what the Kingston Trio sounds like, pick up a collection that doesn't sound like it was recorded in a storm sewer."
1,Don't buy if you're looking for good quality,"My husband was a big fan of the group and I bought this because I liked the selections, but we were both very disappointed by the quality of the recordings. It's not an official version, so none of the songs were studio-recorded, which would be okay if the quality was even half good. But they all sound like they were recorded with a personal tape recorder - in many cases hard to hear, with a lot of background noise. I wouldn't buy this unless I already owned other Kingston Trio recordings and wanted this to round out a collection."
5,FINALLY Rock On makes it to CD,"Yeah, so if you've bought all the other compilations (Very Best of, Mickey and Other Love Songs, Oh Mickey) hoping to have all the songs from both of Toni's albums on cd, of course you fell one track short--Rock On. Well, here it is at last, and the sound quality is perfect on this disc. In fact, the track listing is nearly identical to the ""Very Best Of"" CD, but while that CD included ""Easy for you to Say"" and ""Do You Wanna Dance"", This one replaces those songs with ""Rock On"" and ""Best Performance."" You pretty much have to have 3 or 4 different Toni Basil compilation CDs in order to have all the output from her two albums on CD. If only a comprehensive 2-disc set would be released with ALL the songs from both albums, all the 12"" mixes, and the 3 or 4 songs she recorded in the second half of the 80s for various movie soundtracks!"
3,I used to Love these.......,I used to Love these.......but unfortunately they just don't seem fresh anymore they are just kinda chewy not crisp and just not what they used to be!~
5,Delicious!,"These Nugo bars did not dissapoint at all! When Costco stopped carrying these, I looked everywhere and could not find them in any stores. I was hesitant about ordering online but decided to give it a try. The Vanilla Yogurt bars arrived extremely fresh. They were so delicious, the box was gone quickly! Definitely will order more!"
5,Refreshingly Different Taste,"If you are like me, you like a ""snack bar"" that does not feature chocolate or peanuts. Well, this is a great choice. It is not sweet like NuGo's other bars, but still has a pleasant taste and a texture that reminds me of ""rice krispie treats"". Plus: only 4 Weight Watcher Points for a snack that fills you up because of the fiber."
1,Worms in the Bar and they don't care,"I used to like nugo's. I always bought their flavors at Costco when they went on the road show... But I found a worm in one of the bars (a sealed bar). I took a picture, sent them an email. They responded saying they would get back to me. 4 months later, it was dropped and no one has ever contacted me... Sorry Nugo, but I thought you could do better. I don't buy them anymore... Beware! look at your bars before eating! They may have some extra protein in them.It makes me choose a star, but I would rather give them a zero in customer service...."
2,Know more...,"I was looking for a low sugar snack, something to munch on while I was on a diet. I figured these sounded great! But I could not find the nutrional details here. I went to the website and found the info, after that I realized that this was not the low fat, low sugar snack I was looking for. Below is the nutrional info for one bar...NUTRITIONAL FACTSServing Size: 1 BarServings Per Package: 1Average/Serving %Calories 170Calories from fat 25Total Fat 2.5g 4%Saturated Fat 1.5g 8%Trans Fat 0g 0%Cholesterol 0mg 0%Sodium 150mg 6%Total Carbohydrate 26g 9%Dietary Fiber 2.5g 5%Sugar 13gProtein 11gVitamin A 40%, Calcium 30%, Thiamin 40%, Niacin 40%, Folic Acid 40%, Vitamin C 40%, Vitamin B-12 40%, Vitamin E 40%, Vitamin B-6 40%, Riboflavin 40%, Iron 5%"
5,Excellent product!,"Increased performance, decreased fuel consumption and sounds great! Highly recommended for new or old vehicle. Excellent purchasing and delivery experience too."
1,This is NOT Tuite - Do NOT Buy Online,"Others have commented about the typos and such, so I won't dwell on that. I will say that the word Tuite should not appear in the title of this book, nor anywhere in the book at all. If you want to look at it, go to your local book store and give it a look prior to buying it. The person who wrote it may be skilled at some things in the martial arts world, however they do not even know the definition of Tuite. Therefore, I can in good conscious state that nothing in this book would be anything even remotely close to what is called Tuite. I go by the definition from Oyata, Seiyu, and I'm sorry but grabbing someones hair is NOT Tuite. Please do not be like me and buy this because it had the name Tuite in it. There is not a single technique in the book that can be called Tuite by Oyata's definition. Go to a book store, peek at it, and you will see.Additionally the publisher should invest in spell-check."
3,Ok.,"I have two dogs and laminate floors. I thought this would be ideal for picking up that last little bit. Wrong! The ""exhaust"" from the dust pan causes hair to be pushed away so I am always chasing it down. There isn't that much suction so it doesn't do a very good job. And I have noticed that dirt that you have sucked up falls back out when you pick up the dust pan."
1,"Decent show, stupid DVD",Show good. Overpriced DVD with no extra features to speak of bad. Plus the redhead is wicked nasty.
1,Please read my review of Volume 1,Please read my review of volume 1. It goes double for this. Sure the women are pretty... but I'd rather sleep in a port a potty than have this in my collection of DVD's.
1,AWFUL QUALITY!,"I know I should have reviewed this before, or even returned it. I can barely watch these DVD's because the quality is SO grainy! The vendor should have checked this out before sending. Very irresponsible!"
1,Sex and the City The complete second season,I ordered the second season for a christmas gift and found out later that the set had two disc's of disc two.They also had a inner label on the C.D.'s that indicated it was from Blockbuster and it was in a C.D. paper envelope and not it's original case.Not impressed with the packaging nor the missing third disc.
5,"Great season, Definitely worth owning!!","This season is great, but a heartbreaker at the same time!! Deals with a lot of issues of single women, and how to deal when an ex has a new relationship. Sooooo many good quotes in this season. The beginning of Miranda and Steves relationship.....Carrie and Big try again.....great season!"
2,Maybe I am just a dumb male from sticksville...,"... but I am afraid Sex in the City leaves me cold. I agree that the writing and acting are consistently above average, but the subject matter ... yecch. Should I have dump the guy who is uncircumsized? How can I get that adorable four thousand dollar handbag? Should I have sex with that cute busboy, or am I just a promiscuous alcoholic? For a conventionally married, non-urban, child rearing male, this stuff reads like a script from another planet. I look forward to the 25th season, when the women are all post-menopausal tarted-up harridans dragging their gigolos to some sad, upscale watering hole and reliving the old days over Cosmos."
4,Funny Funny Funny,"I loved this season. I like how it improved from season one, while staying true to all of the characters. A must buy for all interested in great comedy."
5,"Best writing, acting on TV.","Darren Star hit the jackpot with this show. The writing, acting are absolutely superb. Quality of this show exceeds that of many movies. If you want to find out why this show has generated so much buzz, you must rent/buy the 1st and 2nd seasons. The show is not just only for the ladies. My husband also enjoys the intelligent dialog, themes in the show. We have a great time laughing at all the funny moments on the show. For all you divas out there-- you must check out all the costumes and shoes on the show. Too bad they're from 2 seasons ago..."
1,No redeeming features,Best avoided along with all other mainstream junk. The one value to this series is for American males: take the women in it as an object lesson in what to avoid in life in the realization that there are things worse (much worse) than loneliness.
5,Tells it like it is.,"Most relationship books, movies (DVDs) are pure fantasy; i.e. how things should be, however, Sex & The City hits the target. As the author of From the First Date to the Bedroom--The Single Man's Guide to Success With Women, I love it whenever some of the lines/scenes could be taken from my book.If you don't get HBO and want real info about the dating and mating game--take a gander at Sex & the City!"
5,I could watch it all day.,"I love these women. I think I'm most like Charlotte, but I'd like to be more like Carrie. The women are so different, but still support and love each other. I wish I had that sort of friends. I watched an episode a day so I could make it last. I didn't see them first hand on HBO, but have enjoyed the show as reruns on other channels. Until I started buying the season DVDs I didn't realize how really raw they were. I think the F-word is overused a little, but other than that, it's all good. There is something for everyone."
5,DAUGHTER VERY HAPPY WITH GIFT,I ORDERED THIS DVD SET FOR MY DAUGHTER AS ONE OF HER XMAS GIFTS & SHE WAS VERY HAPPY! THIS IS THE 2ND SERIES WEVE ORDERED THROUGH AMAZON & IT IS THE BEST DEAL ANYWHERE. I SHOP AROUND & AMAZON ALWAYS HAS THE BEST PRICE & THEYRE BRAND NEW - NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER! CAME IN IN A FEW DAYS - NICELY PACKAGED. NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER WIHT THIS ORDER. WEVE TOTALLY ENJOYED THIS DVD SET!
4,"Trendy, Hot, Juicy Tales","When has there ever been a show that can compare to Sex and the City? Carrie, Miranda, Samantha, and Charlotte returned for a second season, continuing to sleep their way into love (if possible). These four leading ladies have become cultural icons; television will never be the same (and, depending upon one's perspective, this will be either an agreeable or despicable trend).I couldn't pull myself away from the TV the whole weekend morning, noon and night!! I have never laughed so hard. This show is so entertaining and true to life. It takes everything that people are scared to openly talk about, and puts these issues into wonderfully written episodes. A MUST HAVE for anyone ready for a real show for real women!!!"
5,More of same but Better... 2nd Season Sex & the City...,"What more can be SAID???... HBO's Sex & the City is a HIT!!! Buy it... gather close friends and watch all 18 episodes back to back... could turn into an interesting party!!!... This series gains momentum and stands out in television history with great writing, acting, and direction. The 4 main characters, you'll find, you really care about because their situations and relationships hit close to home... can't wait for the next season..."
3,Sex and the City Second Season,"Love the series so I had to have this DVD. Cover was slightly broken, but it still held all the DVDs properly. Good otherwise."
4,"LOVE THE DVDS, NOT THE CASE","Obviously, the actual dvds are great. Season 2 is very good. I definately love it... 5 stars. The reason why I rate it 4 stars is because of the plastic case that the dvd's come in. Mine are always ripping and cracking. It looks pretty tacky when I keep having to tape up the sides. Getting the $200 set would be worth it if you dont have any of the seasons already."
5,Love This show,"I love, love, love this show. I had already watched every single episode on this disc but bought it anyway"
5,Thinking about Feelings,"These four women have very different personalities and have a large variety of relationship experiences. Some really difficult issues are handled tastefully, with interesting analysis of what we want and need. It really gets me involved and thinking. The Brain is the biggest sex organ after all!!"
3,a fun toy,"Basically it's a very easy to operate system,but I was very disappointed in the screen size. From the picture online you can't really tell that the screen is only a small fraction of the lid."
4,Good Radio's for the money!,I purchased these for the kids to use while we are camping as well as myself using them for hunting. They did not disappoint me at all. I was afraid the heavy trees would cut out my range but they did very well. I would recommend them to anyone.
4,Very good product,"Muy buen producto, el rendimiento de las baterias podria ser mejor pero por el momento solo fue utilizado en alta montaña, donde el frio puede hacer disminuir su duracion.Lo utilizamos en conjunto con un GXT-500 y en algunas oportunidades el GXT-500 captaba las llamadas y el GXT-750 no.La antena es un poco mas extensa que el GXT-500, lo que hace que sea menos compacto.En definitiva, un muy buen producto. No se si Motorola tiene algun equipo similar en cuanto a alcance."
2,Worst Toy I've Seen in a Long Time!,"My 4 year old and I were very excited to try this toy but our excitement soon turned to frustration and disgust as we encountered one design flaw after another. First, it is impossible for a child to peel off the stickers for the white spaces without removing the black outlines that are supposed to stay fixed. Once those black lines come up, sand gets underneath and they never stay down again and the picture looks incomplete. Also, the ""great"" release button that is supposed to allow you to empty the sand back into the jars JAMMED WITH SAND on our first shake, thereafter allowing the sand to fly out of the device on every subsequent shake so no sand can be reused and it makes a huge mess. Sand also stuck in crevices of the device and then came loose on subsequent shakes causing the colors to mix. THIS TOY IS A DISASTER - I CAN'T WAIT TO THROW IT OUT AND HOPE MY CHILD FORGETS WE EVER OWNED IT!! SHAME ON YOU CRAYOLA."
2,Huge Disappointment,"My 7yr old son got this from Santa. What was I thinking. We saved it for a snowday project. After the prep of filling the small bottles w/sand, very tedious, we then pealed off the background sticker for one picture. The sand does not stick as well as they photo shows, alot of very light shading. Then shake the holder to gather the sand out of the shoot and it now jams open. Then we tried to peel the sticker off for the next area and the sand used for the background is now coming off on my fingers. I could go on but I will simply say, save your money!!"
2,Messier than you think and stickers peel too easy,"My daughter made a sand art picture at a local fair that came out beautiful, so when we got this gift I thought great! But it turned out to be more hassle than workable. The pictures are tiny, and we found the more of the white sticky area we revealed, the less likely the black borders were to stay in place. The base design is supposed to be mess-saving, but the clear top cover does not attach well enough and sand 'leaks' out when shaken. Not all the sand goes into the corner at the end to pour back into the tube, so we had to wipe out the inside after each color. Overall, I would not reccomend this until crayola improves the black bnorders and sand mechinism."
2,Very Disappointing,"My daughter just received this as a birthday gift. It is a nightmare! First of all it claims to be mess free, but that is a completely wrong. The release mechanism that allows you to pour the excess sand out at the end sticks and so when she shakes it the sand pours out all over the place. The kit contains six pictures that have cuts in them over adhesive. To color the picture, you pull off sections of the picture. Even I had difficulty lifting getting the paper to release properly! My daughter was very frustrated and upset that she was unable to do it. In addition, once the six pictures are used up, the whole thing is worthless! On the whole - it is definitely a big disappointment and I would steer clear of buying one."
2,wish I read these reviews before I bought this one,I never would have given this as a gift if I had tried it first. My 7 year old and I had a very hard time peeling the stickers off. The sand kept leaking out of the hole because the release button broke. The frame did not stick down with the provided glue. She was frustrated because she wanted to give one as a gift but the lines kept coming off with the stickers and it was just a mess. It is certainly not a mess free activity either. I would not recommend it for any age.
2,Good idea....not good as designed and sold.,"I think the idea is a great one. My son (4.5) was dying to do it and I was excited to help him. Getting the sand into the teeny bottles was VERY messy and not easily done even for me. The stickers are hard to get off the page without taking other parts of the picture off....and if one part gets off, it won't re-stick and sand gets under it. The 'release' mechanism to return the sand to the bottles got stuck open on the first try. And again, was messy trying to get the sand back into the bottles. Again, if they could fix the mess problem....or maybe not advertise that it's mess free?"
4,THIS WAS GREAT FUN FOR MY 3 1/2 YR. OLD,"HOWEVER, it is a bit messy and definately requires adult assistance. The sand sticks all over (including on top of the sand already on the picture). The dispenser, used to empty extra sand, does not work well at all. We had fun with it, but isn't really user friendly (unless a child is much older!).All in all it was fun and my daughter made pictures for her teacher, aunt and grandparents. She really enjoyed it!Still looking for info on purchasing additional sheets?????"
2,A bit messy,I would only recommend this for parents who like to endure super messy art projects. Top screen really needs a locking mechanism to make it more difficult for sand not to get out. The sand return mechanism is not completely effective as it released sand without the release button pressed. Directions never really tell you what to use the glue stick for. The idea is good to make sand art pictures mess free. But my 3 year and I made the same amount of mess we would have doing a sand project without the Crayola kit. But the crayon-like sand dispensers did make it easier for her to direct the sand.Also disappointed that I haven't found refill kits for the paper projects. 6 project s really won't last long.
1,Dont waste your time or money.,"This garbage is not worth owning. The creator is borderline insane. His ideas are that boxing is the only way to fight, and his broken English is next to impossible to follow. The creator or his representitives are online over on Yahoo and plague the clubs with SPAM and obnoxious posts even after being asked to stop repeatedly. The material that we have viewed is poorly made and the instruction is of very poor quality. You would be better off going to a third grade playground and learning to fight from the class bully. Do yourself a favor and do not waste your money on these vidoes. He has further made reference that America deserved the attack on the 9/11. I would not give this man ANY American money."
5,#1 Album of 2000,"The best album of the year in terms of emotion, musicality, and lyricism. ""I wouldn't wanna happen to you, cos I could never climb the walls you walk through."" ""No, you're not alone, cos everybody's out there on their own."" A reminder that rock bands can still rock, carry a tune, and know what you're going through."
3,"Informative, But Not Focused","I enjoyed reading this story which is based on the real-life experience of the author's father, but at the same time, I felt the story should be narrowed in order to be more powerful. The story is too many things: an overview of the time-period of the story, an explanation of Morse code, an explanation of the steps necessary to obtain a ham radio operator's license, radio equipment, how to build a vacuum tube for transmitters, and then, at the end, a story about how the protagonist helps rescue a far-away family through his ham radio skills. This reads more like a summary than like a powerful story. The information IS interesting -- more interesting than the story."
1,YET AGAIN..Tesla has been erased from history,"At the begining of the book there is a pencil drawing of statues. It's meant to be all the people involved in inventing the radio.Watts,Morse and OF COURSE Marconi is in there but no mention of the man who actually invented it..Nikola Tesla.Please look up Tesla Erased..very informative.My daughter is named Tesla because I wanted her named after someone who was honest and did something to better the world,It's offensive enough that Marconi (aka MarFONI) is in there but Tesla isn't mentioned one bit.Even if you think Marconi ""invented"" it..Tesla should have still been mentioned but who cares about someone who wasn't rich.I proudly named my child after Dr.Tesla who invented way more than the radio and it was a shame to bring her home a book that doesn't even mention him. I am only glad I didn't pay for it but borrowed it from the library"
2,Not a durable product.,"For the first few months I owned my shower radio I was quite pleased with the purchase. I received very good radio reception -- as good as my clock radio. However, after about three months it stopped working (I thought the batteries had run down). I purchased new batteries, but it no longer functions. I didn't notice anywhere that water had gotten into it... and I kept it in a place above the showerhead so any water that would have been on it was mostly condensation. Anyway... I'll not likely buy a CD player for my shower again and just stick to having one on the counter."
4,Overall a good collection.,"As you can see by the track listing some of them are live. I would rather have the studio version of Gimme Back My Bullets, and the live version of Gimme Three Steps. I also could have done without the Live version of Free Bird as the studio version is also included. That would have freed space for one or two more tracks, maybe The Needle and the Spoon. But overall a good sampling of a great band. Their first album was released in 1973, and Street Survivors in 1977. It's amazing to see the number of great songs they produced in that short period of time, many of which you still hear every day on the radio."
1,"bad battery, bad company","I ordered multiple brands and capacity for this type of battery so I could see which worked best, but the company decided to be ""the good guy"" and send me all of the same higher capacity battery, all of these batteries barely lasted 4 months before being able to hold a charge anymore.I do not suggest this battery or ""thebatterycenter"" company"
1,Disappointing and Overpriced,"My 20 month old quickly tired of this product that in retrospect was advertised misleadingly. Consisting of only numbers 1-5 with colored pegs that insert into each corresponding number appeared overly-simple for the age range specified. Making matters worse, it was hugely overpriced as compared to the Little Leap (Leap Frog) toy I purchased along with this."
4,Practical insights,Very useful to any professional trying to get their head around an adopted child's issues. Quite helpful to parents who adopt as well.
5,Excellent for people who have been lost their whole lives.,"As an adoptee I have never fit it and I have always felt likea stranger in my family. When I read this book it was likereading my own feelings. I have been able to understand andexpress my feelings regarding adoption since reading thisbook because now my feelings have been validated. I highlyrecommend this book for any one wanting to understand howit feels to be adopted. This applies to adoptees, birthparentsand adoptive parents alike, as well as extended familymembers and friends."
5,Absolute Truth About Adoption,"In ""Journey of the Adopted Self,"" Betty Jean Lifton writes an amazingly comprehensive account of what it means to be adopted. This book is my most dependable reference in traversing the uneven ground of reunion with my relinquished daughter. BJ Lifton has helped sensitize me to the special challenges associated with having been relinquished and adopted. Her contribution has been invaluable to me.I have recommended this book to many others and made a gift of this book to many more."
5,Best Adoption Book,"I am an adoptee, and this is by far the best book exploring what and why adoptees feel the disconnection they often do. I highly recommend it before reading anything else on the subject."
1,Very disappointed,"I finally opened this book after many years on my shelf to help me in my quest to tell my adopted kids that I have made contact with their birthmother. What I read was a lot of anger, stories of unsuccessful reunions, and a feeling that an adopted child can never reach peace with either family. I refuse to believe that is true, but that is how the book comes across. Some points in the book are excellent, but the negative was just so prevelant."
2,Making A Big Deal Out Of Nothing,"When one reads a book about ""A Quest For Wholeness,"" it's quickly apparent that the author is projecting her lack of ""wholeness"" on others. There is nothing ""unwhole"" about adoptees, and that reality renders this book meaningless. Also, you've really got to wonder about an adult woman who--besides Monica Lewinsky, perhaps--that would allow herself to be addressed as ""BJ."""
4,Adoptee heritage: deliberately & forcibly kept secret,"Some may argue that there is nothing ""unwhole"" about adoptees. Then again, some people are wildly outraged by adoptees searching - those people usually threatened themselves by the notion for some personal reason. As an adoptee who had a positive adoptive experience I nonetheless felt the need to search. My parents helped me and the experience ultimately did make me feel more ""whole"", although it was not entirely positive. Lifton writes beautifully and incorporates poetry, folklore and psychology into her tale of the adoptee experience. I don't agree with the emphasis on in-utero and birthing experiences as forming later attitudes, and I also don't think open adoption is for everyone, but I do think this is a wonderful, worthwhile book all people touched by adoption should read."
5,A Must Have for Adoptees,"This book is a must have for adoptees and can be useful for birth and adoptive parents. It gave me insights into myself as an adoptee. It clarified emotions and frustrations that I had felt all of my life. It brings to the forefront the true emotional drama that exists in adoption. It doesn't sugarcoat the realities, and it bares the raw and powerful emotions that follow the adopted child all of his/her life. If you want validation, this is the book for you."
4,cute little lifestyle book on gay bears,"This is a lighthearted, illustrated book about bears (chubby, hairy gay men) and their culture. It includes a lot of living hints such as names for different goatees, computer emoticons in order to describe one's self, etc. For anybody who tries to collect all literature on bears, you must own this book. I only have two critiques. First, there is only one picture of a man of color in it. Second, the book casts all bears as butch: like mama bears don't exist!"
4,BABY BOOM/ MR. MOM,JUST THE GREATEST THAT MY WIFE CAN SAY!!!!!!!Baby Boom / Mr. Mom (Double Feature)
1,Sorry I spent the money on this!,"I thought I had a handy hand held trimmer - so that I didn't have to haul out my big trimmer everytime there was tall grass around my deck. Within seconds of using - just on the grass at the edge of my deck - the plastic ""blade"" broke. I thought maybe I had hit it on the concrete edging. I then replaced the ""blade"" and held it high above the edging to get the grass and the grass!! breaks the ""blade"" again!!! The plastic ""blade"" can not withstand trimming grass. I am throwing this away -and sorry I spent my money on it - I tried the website listed on the pkging and it was not found. I will still try to contact the company. Save your money!"
4,pretentious sleeper-folk from montreal,"Seven core members playing more than a dozen instruments: guitars, banjos, oud, organs, piano, upright bass, cello, violin, drums, scrap-metal, saws, accordion and harmonica. Slowwww whispy folk, very low pulse and understated, yet moving nonetheless. They're on Alien8 Recordings along with that other Godspeed You Black Emperor side project, Set Fire To Flames. Worth it if you can find a copy."
4,Boldly lucking out...,"I found this gift set item with a crunched box and paid much less for it then I ever would have thought I could. I love these dolls, what can I say. I purchased them for my toddler daughter. She gets a Barbie & Ken, I get to influence her in a nerdy way. We did put up all of the tiny accessories for later years. I still brag about my Barbie Star Trek find."
4,I can't last a day without these!,"Having extremely oily skin, I use these every single day. If not, I feel as if my skin is dripping with oil (YUCK!) I thought with age the oiliness on my skin would subside; at this writing, I'm 38 and I still have acne and oily skin. These sheets are a wonder and they really don't disturb your make-up, although you might want to touch-up after you've used a sheet. The only thing preventing me from giving this product 5 stars is their size: they should be bigger, I think. Instead of just one sheet, I use two or three. Anyhow, if you have oily/shiny skin like I do, these will do the job. I hope you love them as much as I do!"
5,Very good,It completely absorbs oil. Since my skin is oily and in summer this helps a lot! I use this very often almost every two hours nowdays. I was used having a shine on my face but now it looks very clear.
4,"Great Absorbant, but small in size","I have very oily skin and these sheets work so well, and after i use these my face doesnt shime as much!! The only con about this product is the size, the size can be bigger."
3,Not bad,"I have tried three types of blotting papers so far for oily skin: Clean and Clear, Palladio and 24/7. The Clean and Clear did remove the oily shine and I didn't notice any residue on my skin. I didn't like the texture of the Clean and Clear sheets on my face (somewhat rubbery) and sometimes couldn't get one sheet out at a time. My favorite are the Palladio for ease of use and the option of a slight powder finish (on one side of the paper - so you can just absorb oil if you prefer). The Clean and Clear are better than the 24/7 which left a ghostly white powder on my face (only comes in one color)."
1,Horrible... Just Horrible,These two people have no reason to be in front of a camera much less charge a DVD $20. You see better tv personalities on youtube. They speak in 100% pure hearsay. All their facts and figures are just as bad as watching a 24/7 news channel. Basically you're supposed to believe what they say simply because they say it....I sir refuse to believe you just because you say its true. Its the whole space kettle theory all over again.
1,Are you kidding ?,"My 4-year old kid could have done a better job on making this film than the guy and gal in this DVD ! She was a joke - reading off prompt cards throughout the show, and finally doing a ""And-you-were-there"" conversation with the (""quote"") dead - - - which was SO PHONEY that I finally had to shut the whole stupid movie off ! It was HORRIBLE ! The interviews with hotel employees was SO BAD, that it looked like the editing was done by a child. Just ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC ! I was hoping for a GOOD solid DVD about probably THE MOST HAUNTED HOUSE IN AMERICA: The Whaley House, in Old Town, located in San Diego, California. Instead, I watch a trashy and C-grade blunder of what could have been an AWESOME DVD !Yuck - ""Two thumbs WAY DOWN"" - (Siskel & Ebert)"
3,Beyonce-fan Disappointed,I expected this dvd to be better than what it was. It looked like something that was recorded from a tv special on Beyonce.
1,Does not fit Beretta Nana,"This was the only holster that came up when searching for a Beretta Nano on Amazon.com. It is way too small and does not cover the trigger as indicated in the photo.Other Beretta models were listed on the packaging when I received the item, but not the Nano."
5,We. LOVE. This!,It's our breakfast viewing pleasure on the iMac! Sooooo very good! Thanks for putting it on Prime. Our sons love it!
3,missing episodes,"Hi. I don't think that all of season 4 is there. Not sure why they did it like that, but if you check an episode guide, you'll find out that about half of it is missing. Good show though."
1,"no CC, no subtitles","well, the show itself is 5 stars, but these chintzy companies releasing stuff these days without CC or with subtitles, screw 'em...Millions of people are hard of hearing or deaf..."
3,But are they THE ORIGINAL TITLES???,"The first 3 dvd box sets were released with Jay Ward's Widow's supervision which meant, she only wanted the second season's main titles on EVERY SINGLE SEASON as well as changing ""The Bullwinkle Show"" to have new CGI graphics as well as a new narration in the style of Bill Conrad. Now that she's died, have they gone to the original aired titles without the bastardization?"
2,Too little content,"I used to enjoy watching this show on TV. However, the DVD's are like watching the show with commercials. There is so much repeat content associated with each skit, that maybe 25% is original."
4,Introductory design for the novice cabinetmaker,"As a novice woodworker, but a professional trades instructor, I found this book to be a wonderful source of information about traditional and contemporary styles and techniques in furniture and cabinetmaking. It introduces the fundamentals of furniture anatomy, styles and wood movement. You are then moved along to joinery and furniture subassemblies with detailed and very readable illustrations. The strength of the book is, indeed, in the illustrations. The project section illustrates, by example, the styles and techniques introduced earlier but allows Woodworkers the freedom to add dimensions of their own. It is a very useful guide for those who are looking for ideas and allows great freedom to customize the design without getting too far off track."
2,"Good idea book, but very short on designs and joinery method","Illustrated Cabinetmaking would make a decent idea book, but falls short if you're looking for a ""how to"" book. It is filled with many different types of furniture designs, including alternates. The chapters on furniture style and anatomy are adequate, however, the ones on joinery are lacking. Although quite adequate in describing and showing limited illustrations of the joints, there is virtually no instruction on how to construct them. The same problem occurs in the furniture section. The description is short and offers very little construction information. Consider the spice box on pages 272-273. The door of the illustration on page 272 appears to be lipped, but has a half mortise lock. What does it lock into?"
5,One of the BEST woodworking books I own!,"This book is very complete covering fundamentals of furniture anatomy, styles, and wood movement, various joints, subassemblies used in all kinds of projects, and Furniture.This is a great book for the beginner or professional.Provides a lot of good inspiration as well.Dining tables, occasional tables, desks, chests, cabinets, built-in cabinets, and beds are all of the Furniture types covered.Beautifuly illustrated with exploded plans of how all of the parts go together... I can thumb through it and end up reading it for hours!! It's just really a very great book to own if you're interested in woodworking.It seems I always have within an arms reach!I love it!"
3,Okay but disappointing.,"This came in the condition of a library book, it looked worn and it still had stickiness on the back from a tag put on it. The material of the book is excellent, I was just disappointed in the cover of the book."
1,Pass over this one,"If you're looking for a romance novel, this is the place. If you're looking for a novel about flying, fliers, and aircraft, go look for something by Tom Wilson. If James Michener had set out to write Peyton Place, this would be the result. The male characters are angst-ridden caricatures, the females are all sex-obsessed nut-jobs. The flying sequences are virtually non-existent. There were two - count `em, TWO! -- flying sequences from WWII! The author has never been there, and knows nothing about the culture or history of flight. I gave up halfway through the book. This one's bound for the used book store as a trade-in."
5,Native Wisdom for White Minds,I have been reading this book for some time and it has always been just what I needed to hear. I have had many friends read it over the years as well and they have even gone out and have gotten one for them selfves. It has help keep me inspired in my own recovery;as well as to help others in there own recovery.
2,It's OK,"This book was a bit of a disappointment. I guess I should've read the fine print - the cover art led me to believe that it was Native American philosophy and found that it was stuff from all around the world (Ireland, England, etc.) and most of the passages just didn't do much for me. They seemed disjointed and most didn't provide very much inspiration for me. I've had much better ""thought for the day"" books."
3,White Minds that need Native Wisdom,"Thsi is a good source of daily meditation.Not exactly as I had antipated, but nonrtheless, this book does help you to stop and reflect on you life and they way you are living it.It helps you to look at more simpler way of viewing and interpreting life."
2,Native Wisdom for White Minds,I did not expect what I got from this book. I have only purchased history books and Native American books. It was on the recommended list for me and I made the mistate of thinking it was Native American Wisdom for White Minds. As it turns out it is native wisdom from all over the world. That is ok if that is what you were looking for but I have already studied religions of the world and was looking for specifically Native American wisdom and/or spirituality.
5,introduction to advanced play in bridge,"Terence Reese has written books on many aspects of bridge, both alone and with various collaborators. In this book, he describes many of the areas of play that distinguish the expert from the pedestrian club player. The topics covered include inferences that can be drawn from opponents' plays, timing and control of the trump suit, tactical plays such as holdups, waiting moves and deceptive measures, and techniques such as timing, entries, endplays and squeezes.The style is Reese at his best. Hands that contain the essence of an idea are examined, and further examples given to illustrate the idea. On the whole, an excellent book for an aspiring bridge player to study and learn."
2,Ok,"I enjoyed the first novel in this series, but the second I didn't really care for... I actually didn't finish reading the book. I read the first few chapters and skimmed the rest of the book just so I could read the ending. I didn't find it all that exciting and finding out that Sam wasn't dead in the first few chapters kinda took the suspense right out of it. As I said I liked the first book, but I don't think I will read the third."
3,"Installation was ok, but wasn't 100% fit for OEM part","Installation instructions are pretty generic, so if you're buying this make sure you have a guide from somewhere else to walk you through the process. Installing was simple, but it was not a 100% OEM fit as I had to fight with the part to get it into place whereas the original part came out and went back in with no issue."
4,So...you think you might have a problem with selfishness???,"Wow! What a great book! Yes, it was written in the 1970's, but the content was strikingly honest, concise and revealing. It clearly lays out what exactly a life looks like that is too self absorbed. Sadly, what is discovered is that in working so hard to be self seeking, one's self destruction is what is found. Health, relationships, success....hardcore selfishness is the enemy and not a positive attribute! So glad that I could still get my own personal copy of the book after reading a friends copy. You will want one to highlight and underline!"
4,Student entering into Geriatrics,"I found this book to be relevant in my studies as a OTAS. My field of specialty is Geriatrics, so this book provided many areas of expertise that has better prepared me for when I am ready to practice. The chapters we detailed with relevant information. I would recommed this book for any OTAS who may want to specialize in this field."
4,Fair shape,"The book was in fair shape when I received it. However, it was a great price for the shape it was in."
5,Very Impressive,"The author drew me in right away with her vivid depiction of small-town life and controversy. The character interactions are true-to-life, and I enjoyed following these people as they uncovered and confronted the ugliness in their town's history."
4,Great Book!,I love this series! Cannot wait to read the next one! I would love for these to be available in e-format.
1,Mis-Leading Description,"This is a 100% plastic item. The description gives the ""impression"" it is metal. The description states ""Chrome"" and ""Die Cast"". I may or may not return the item. I believe that it will break VERY easily!"
2,please do not buy,"I bought this plane with high enthusiasm. When it arrived with a broken charger, i was frustrated but the company agreed to send a new one. Then when I tried flying it took to many nose dives, because the plane's front is too heavy. Finally the the engine jammed up and it was only the first time flying it. I am an experienced rc pilot, and this was the worst plane i have ever flown. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,Who is this book for?,"I know a little about Lupton's career -- teaching, writing, and curating shows. She seems very intelligent, but I don't understand who this book is really for. Beginning or advanced people? Crafters or designers? Some of the ideas in this book (wrapping paper) are so obvious that I think anyone with an ounce of creativity has already figured them out. Some things (commercial embroidery) seem very advanced and specialized, and not useful to most people. The layout of the book is nice, but the content is very inconsistent. Was this really a student project, as someone mentioned? If so, I think Lupton should have made more of an effort to make sure that everything came together and made for a coherent whole. I think there are better DIY books out there."
3,A pretty but only introductory book on design,"I'd had the impression that I would learn some techniques on creating my own stuff: business cards, websites, t-shirts, stationary, etc. They touch on all these subjects, and more, in the book. But I was disappointed that it is really more just a collection of ideas and work that MFA and graphic arts students have created, with very little technical detail of how to create designs for yourself. I was looking for a how-to, not a see-what-we've-done."
5,D.I.Y - Love this book,I bought this for my 16 year-old. It has great ideas and explains them in simple terms. Not just a follow the directions book - it explains concepts and encourages experimentation.
2,How To Be Ironically Tacky,"Pretentious art student tripe, mostly. I discovered that I can wrap gifts with newspaper! I can use a graph paper notebook for a scrapbook! I was looking for examples of cutting-edge design, and a methodology to implement it. What I got was the product of the tragically hip after too many lattes."
5,Very Clever!,"In an age where everything looks the same, author Ellen Lupton and her team have put together an inspiring book on how to create graphics (t-shirts, magazines, books, logos) without going through conventional printing processes. Lots of interesting ideas here. A fun and inspiring read."
1,"Marxism, Flies and Fetuses","I glanced through the book and thought it had some good product ideas. When I dove more deeply in it I discovered that it is basically dedicated to Karl Marx, founder of Marxism, precursor to Communism. Odd connection to design. There is also a lovely project depicted for those who love flies and fetuses. There are fake flies sewn on a pillow with hand drawn fetuses to top it off. Guess that would be a conversation starter. I love all kinds of books and have never rated this low. Skip this one."
3,Great LCD - yeah right!,"The LCD screen on this toy is too small. You can't see the screen at all and the resolution is horrible. It has great features and wonderful games, but you really can't play them and enjoy them with the display being so small."
2,Hot Wheels Accelerator Disappointments,The screen is horribly small. I watch as my boys squint to see it. Then in my package there were no instructions. We bought it out of state and could not return it anywhere around where we lived. We wrote for instructions and never received any. How unfair. And my boys love anything hotwheels. My 15 year old has collected them forever so this was a BIG let down.
4,fon for the holidays,I wondered why no one had capitalized on using holiday music for workouts and was happy to find one.This is short and festive not super hard and takes place ina holiday decorated living roomcorny but cute nd cool because it fits in with the season. Now I can go to holidays parties and work off that egg nog!!!She even says start this during thanksgiving up to new year COOL then making up in January wont be so hard when you are working out all along.moves are easy weights are light3rd interval she kicked it up to hi impact but you can stay lowI plan on doing this all through the holiday season Very happy I got it and a great gift if there is someone on your list who is an intermediate at home excerciser Only wish they had an ab workout on it
5,PERFECT,"I wish i had this diaper back pack to start with. There is also a line called Daisy Gear which offers a similar line of products as well as some as the same.. just to let anyone know.I LOVE THIS BACPACK! It's comfortable and offers plenty of storage space. Worth every penny. The company is great too. The diaper wipes dispenser was broken so I called the company, they shipped a new one out immediately!When my daughter gets older and less demanding (diaper bag wise) I intend on buying the Daisy Gear tote.This bag really has everything you'll need."
3,Nice design but ugly fabric,"Purchased through Amazon.com who used BabyAge. I was very disappointed with the service at BabyAge. I wanted to return the product because it came with black marks on it plus I did not like the fabric - the light colored fabric is made of a unappealing synthetic leather. I had to wait for so long - approx 25 minutes - to get a live person to assist me. Then instead of crediting my credit card like they were supposed to, they just gave me store credit. Then I had to call AGAIN to straighten this out and spent another 20 minutes on hold to get a live person. Did not like BabyAge service and will never order through them again. Did not like fabric on backpack however the design of backpack was very nice. Would consider buying a differnt Dadgear backpack, just not the ""professional"" kind, and would not order through BabyAge."
3,"Great Backpack, but could be better","I got this for my husband for father's day since he was not liking my diaper bag that has pink and bows on it.... Turns out that I began using it all the time too.It has a ton of different zippered compartments for all the various items you need to take along and plenty of space (I easily get everything needed for a day out w/ my 2 y/o and 4 mnth old, along w/ my wallet, phone, etc).Two things that could be improved:1) The two spaces where you can zip in cups are not padded to keep drinks cold2) It was a good idea to create a separate pocket for wipes, but I've found that I generally just throw my wipes package into the bag so either that compartment could be improved to hold diffent types of wipe packages, or possibly could be done away with altogether. The plastic wipes box sent is very thin so it doesn't hold my jumbo sized packages."
1,buy something else,"I had a Baby Innovations backpack bag that had lots of pockets, but with a toddler and another one on the way I needed something bigger. Looked at all the reviews for this bag and the Baby Sherpa. Despite no insulation, I ordered the DadGear. I was very disappointed. I knew going in there was no insulation, but there weren't enough compartments to store things, the inside is just one big hole, and the changing pad could only be for a little baby it is so small. I ended up ordering the Baby Sherpa and comparing them side by side. I returned the DadGear and KEPT the Sherpa."
4,Dad Gear Backpack,We like all of the compartmens inside. Easy to get to. Perfect for the Dad on the go.
2,Falling apart at 4 months old,"This bag is designed great. It holds everything you need and then some. However the construction is really poor. We purchased the bag in June 2010 and it already falling apart. Both my wife and I use the bag. We are not rough with the bag. The inside linner is shredding in several of the pocket areas. The stiching is seperating on the the outsided pockets.For the price the bag should last longer. I can understand the outside getting beat up. But, the inside should not be falling apart."
3,Good Idea bummer it tore,I got this bag about a year ago and it has served me well with one exception. The seem on the top by the handle has completely ripped open and the bag is almost unusable. Bummer because I really liked it.
5,Great bag!,"This bag is definitely worth the extra money. It was a replacement for the Skip Hop Via backpack and this bag is much more comfortable, holds a lot more, and it's much easier to get to everything in the back section. We really like the built in wipes case and the diaper pocket. No more digging through the bag trying to find them while trying to keep a squirming baby on the changing table.There are a couple of things that could be better. The changing pad isn't padded, it's just a thin piece of nylon. It works fine as a cover for the changing surface but doesn't add any cushioning. This is a minor complaint since it's easy enough to buy a separate changing pad. Another thing I'm not crazy about is the stroller clips. They're attached to the bag with a thin piece of fabric that seem flimsy, although they've held up fine so far.Overall this is a great bag. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a backpack diaper bag."
5,Holds everything,"I love this bag. It's plain looking and it's pretty large, but it hold EVERYTHING. It's easy to organize all of baby's stuff and it's especially good for overnight trips where you need to bring along extra stuff. My favorite thing is the diaper hammock and the little wipes pouch. You never have to dig around for diapers, there easily accessible and it's easy to spot when you're running low.p.s. I'm a mom, but I still carry this bag. It may not be all cute and covered in flowers, but it allows me to carry my son, my purse, and the diaper bag without a struggle."
5,Such a great product!!!!,"This is such a great back pack!This upper part JUST for diapers,makes it so valueable cause i don't have to open the whole bag to search for them and they are always clean and ready...The same for the down front part wich allows me to grab the wipes without having to look for them!I love it, it is VERYVERYVERY spacy, its not huge but well projected with good divisions without over doing them to the point i get crazy looking for things...Really worth it!!!"
4,As per expectation,+ many compartment+ side pocket can fit thermos- expected the material to be slightly thickerOverall happy with purchase.
3,Fairly General,"The AWP guide is fine if you're looking for general information, but it doesn't go into a lot of depth about any of the programs. The standard guide that everyone recommends is Amy Holman's An Insider's Guide to MFA Programs, which is actually outstanding. The MFA Handbook by Tom Kealey is okay too, but it's pretty subjective and not always accurate and a lot of people seem to distrust it. I haven't actually seen it so I can't say, but that's what I've heard.I don't think it would hurt to have the AWP Guide as a resource, but if you're only going to buy one I'd go with the Insider's Guide."
5,ATT E5900B 5.8 - A great buy for a great phone,"Like so many, I ""over-reshearched"" initially and then realized I would miss out entirely if I let every little ""knock"" on a particular model make a decision impossible. I was on Amazon for an entirely different purpose when the price of this model caught my eye, and I decided to take the plunge and not be distraught if a discounter 1000's of miles away had a slightly better ""deal."" I did insist on 5.8 Ghz and am very glad I did. I can ""roam"" freely throughout the house with no annoying ""buzz."" The speakerphone is supurb even when speaking with callers on a cell - very clear. I must now take the time to buy a third remote. My only regret is that I did not (yet) craft a central plan and make my ATT a ""true"" multi-line house phone. It is certainly up to it and I do plan to add at least one more remote line in the basement as soon as renovations there are complete. ""Highly recommend - both Amazon and the ATT E5900B."" And by all means DO go with 5.8!"
5,Strong bonding,"These patches are really easy to use. Place a piece on the tear/hole/or whatever it is you're trying to repair, and place a hot iron for 30 seconds. Thats it. I've used it mainly for repairing holes and tears on comforters and quilts. I've also tried it on a cotton shirt elbow.This is ideal for internal damage/tear etc.To repair external damage, you may want to consider matching colors or a way to dye the repaired fabric once you've plugged the hole. For e.g I'm thinking of getting the denim repair kit for fixing rips in my jeans."
5,Add this book to your collection,This is a very powerful book. The images are breathtaking and the organization of the book gives more meaning to them. This is a visual history of being African-American. Add it to your home library for your children.
4,Thanks for the confirmation,"I watched all the cable news shows, so I knew alot of what was already in this book. I also watched all the C-span coverage which really was more truthful. But I am gratefully to Mr Tapper for putting it altogether, filling so many gaps in our knowledge and confirming all my suspisions. The only thing missing were some timeline and flow chart graphics. There is so much to keep track of. So now that we know so much, what the hell can we do about i?. Do I hear impeachment? Do I hear national revote? It is about time that we start using this incredible technology that we have for something other than spying on our private citizenry. We need all new, tamper proof, voting equipment that is the same all over the country."
4,A glimpse into the dark side,"Tapper shines a bright light on the Y2K election, not so much to illuminate as to expose it's underbelly. Just about any conspiracy theory is worth considering, and dirt is thrown in everyone's direction. Some of his attacks seem fair, others seem gratuitous.But Tapper tries to be fair, and tries to present everyones' points of views and suspicions. The only actors in this drama that come out clean are those who provided interviews for his book (who are many).Tapper is hard to pin down politically, but he comes down harder on Bush than Gore. Maybe that's because he understands Gore's position better. Or maybe it's because Bush won, and it's tempting to believe that power comes in direct proportion to corruption.When attempting to be unbiased, a writer can either distance himself from his subject matter, or he can fully engage in the emotions and rational of all sides of the issue. Tapper does the latter, and for that reason alone is worth reading"
1,"Bad law, straw men and guilt by association ...","... are all the tools used by this author. There is nothing here that regular readers of news coverage during the election turmoil have not seen. However, Tapper uses the politician's trick of taking a few facts and then using wild deductions to make fantastic allegations. (This is a good lesson in why scientists use ""inductive"" rather than ""deductive"" reasoning. The latter can be used to prove almost anything.)Rather than waste time with this book (which I'm happy to have picked up used, not new), I suggest the curious reread the coverage of the post-election recounts. There the irony (and paranoia) of both sides' legal arguments become clear. Most of the more ""liberal"" recount methods--those opposed by Bush and his team--applied to the infamous ballots would have given Bush the election. Most of the most restrictive or ""conservative"" recount methods--those opposed by Gore--would have given Gore the election."
1,"A waste of time, money, ink and paper","A poor excuse for journalism - Mr. Tapper should keep to telling the story without the colorful references to ""Bushies"", ""Gorbies"" and his grating personal observances of figures central to the issue. I thought the penchant for shock chapter titles and petty personalizations fell by the wayside in 8th-grade creative writing, but sadly that is apparently not the case.I tried to read this book - I knew it had to get better... By page 200 it was in the rubbish can."
5,A FANTASTIC PAGE-TURNER,"Tapper is one hell of a writer - I can't believe a book about politics would have me so engrossed. His witty style of writing makes the book very hard to turn down. There's one crazy event after another. As a resident of south Florida, I can attest to the accuracy with which Mr. Tapper describes the local political environment. It is a mess down here."
5,Buy this Book,"Although I am not a political junky, and at times get fed up with much of the US's political scene, a friend recommended this book to me (she read it on another friend's advice) and I was pleasently surpirsed, to the extent that I chose to write this review (which I've never done before).This book is clearly clever, and more importantly, is a very good read that lets the reader know some of the dirty things that went down in Florida in an extremely interesting way. Much of the media seems quite dry to me these days, so it was nice to get a unique persepctive on all the Florida madness.Two thumbs up for Down and Dirty and my best to to the author, Jake Tapper, on a job well done.p.s. I even plan on starting to read Tapper's stuff on salon.com after reading this book."
1,Tapper's the Down and Dirty One,"The book is a compendium of ""aren't I clever"" observations by a reporter who obviously prefers to be fast rather than right. Per the New York Times Book Review, ""Deadlock"" (by Washington Post reporters)is a more balanced, thoughtful work."
1,Don't Bother,This book is a classic example of extracting a pound of lies from an ounce of truth. It is riddled with cliches and unsupported conclusions. It isn't even a good read. The accounts of the Florida election in the news give a much better feeling and understanding of those events. Don't waste your time with this.
1,Since there is no ZERO on the star scale...,"Only in America could a ""journalist"" write a book without factual data to support his claims. Only his political opinions (I thought they weren't supposed to have any) are given as reasons to believe his word and his conclusions. If your a liberal, your going to love this book. On the other hand, if your intelleigent you'll wait for history to produce a more unbiased view."
2,Another way to say the same,"Is so fashionable!! Pilates is the thing to do, just like the stars. And so many authors profit from it: writing the same thing all over again with just a few changes in the vocabulary or maybe in a few exercises. Pilates is to be taught by a trained person. Trust me no Hollywood star sits in front of a video or just reads a book. There is no substitute for personal training. I find it a bit cheeky to try to make money with someone elses ideas and exercises. And to imply that you can learn it by reading a book. Will you buy a book on how to perform open heart surgery? Another try. Another failure."
5,Superb history of an extraordinary woman,"Having been educated by the Grey Nuns whom St. Marguerite founded, I knew some aspects of her story already. However, I have read this book at least 6 times and never cease to be amazed at her courage and her faith, and her dignity in the face of ugly taunts and adversity. Anyone of any faith should enjoy this story about a woman who was able to succeed despite the odds against her as a woman, a widow of a despicable man, and as a religious in the 1700s. A story of courage and perseverence and great accomplishment - plus some fun about hiding an Indian under her skirts so a French soldier could not find him. Give it a chance and I am sure you will enjoy her story. She became a saint in the Catholic Church in the early 1990s."
4,Encourages creative thinking in toddlers,My 4yr old loved this toy. It gives him a chance to talk about shapes and how many sides they have.. How differen shapes can make pictures... A creative process for him.
3,Great tangram puzzle,"This is a good product to play with child but the only drawback is the limited amount of puzzle pages. My three years old son will usually jump to level 3 difficulty level, perhaps he has done another puzzle under Learning resources so this set becomes relatively easy for him."
2,disappointing,"This season was far worse than the first one. This is caused by two problems beyond the ones described in my review of the first season.The first problem is that the scripts would have made good programs if the surrealistic-subtle satire style of the earlier Avenger programs was adhered to. The dead serious cops and robbers style of the New Avengers was not matched to the scripts. Al of the books on this series roundly condemn the New Avengers as being a poor shadow of the original program.The second problem was the lack of funds caused by several financial backers not investing in the program at the last minute. Because of the seriously limited production budget, the scenes are dragged out beyond the optimum length to pad the program to an hour. One example is several minutes of a police car being driven around city streets at the legal speed limit."
1,wasteful!,"I recieved this as a gift but never really used it. After researching Gerber baby bath products, I switched to more natural products. I found this kit to be completely unnecessary. The products are filled with chemicals, something I am not comfortable using on my baby."
1,Smell is very strong,I don not like these washes at all. The scent is very very overpowering!!!!! I had to mix only a little of one with another unscented brand and it is still too strong. I do love the case though. It is sturdy and has lots of room.
2,dries out my son's skin,"didn't like it. it dried out my son's skin. it's smelt ok, but the lavander bath didn't help him fall asleep either."
2,too harsh,"i love the lavendar bedtime bath, but these are too harsh for babys skin, especially excema... go with aquaphor baby wash."
5,Smells so good!,I think that grins and giggles is the best smelling baby product so far. I highly recommend the milk and honey!
4,Good as a gift,"I put this on my registry so I wouldn't have to worry about buying all the different baby soaps and shampoos separately. Everything in the set is full-size, which is nice. The tote is very large and roomy - I've added several more full-size bottles to what came in the original set and there's still plenty of room to spare. While it would probably be a couple of dollars cheaper to buy all the items separately and put them into a plastic tote, the set makes a nice shower gift and saves time and effort over buying each item individually."
5,Grins & Giggles,I just want to say that this is the best smelling product around. The other shampoos and washes don't have a fresh smell the way these produsts do. I don't think that I'll ever use any other product unless I'm forced to do so. All of them smell so good. My daughter doesn't seem to mind them either. I am always tempted to use them myself.
1,Not hypoallergenic,"Yesterday I couldn't find my usual baby lotion, so I used the giggles and grins hypoallergenic ""oatmeal"" lotion on my two month old. He broke out in a splotchy, red, dry painful rash. I checked the ingredients, and there was fragrance! Fragrance should eliminate the hypoallergenic label. Very not happy about that. Today I am buying extras of Aveeno Baby fragrance free."
3,shower gift,"I sent this as a shower gift. My friend was thrilled and disappointed at the same time because the container was broken when it arrived. The shipping was not carefully prepared because the whole plastic container was put into a big box without any padding or bubble plastic to keep it from moving or being shifted. Her remark was ""I can't believe such a big company is so cheap and/or inconsiderate in shipping item like this"" :("
2,Not as gentle as you think,I generally like any product gerber has to offer. The storage unit is great but the shampoo (especially the lavender wash) is very perfumey and was irritating to my baby's skin
3,"""Heavy"" on the drum....must be kidding?","The first Medicine Head album on Dandelion (John Peel's company,no less!)was such a great listen I thought I REALLY needed this one,.....but ,sad to say,as far as I can hear on this one,they had lost their spirit here(and just their second album too!).The drums are mixed waaaay back,....so what's with that title here? In fact many of the pieces sound a lot less accomplished compared to the first album,which I fully recommend if you like modern bands like Black Keys and White Stripes....just to hear two man/person band pre-cursors.Things get a bit cacophonis,drums NOT matching the sounds played,ie;""racing"" to catch-up,and atonal (maybe out-of-tune) parts along the way also. There were a few tracks that seemed similar to what I'd heard on the first album.....but I'd say to hear the real interesting music this band was known for in the early days get ""New Bottles Old Medicine""."
1,Bad quality,"I bought this clipon from Amazon.The first time I tried it on by clipping onto my specs, and then raising the shades, the shades part came off the clip.I put them back together again, but it kept coming out. On closer scrutiny I found that the center flat of the shades part was not being completely held down by the spring, there was a gap, which allowed the shades part to disengage from the spring clip portion.Until today, I haven't used it yet. I'm looking for a cheap pair of clipon shades that I can dismantle and try to replace the it's clip with the eagle eyes clip.The products sucks in quality. Just another American company outsourcing to China with cheap quality products while they rake in the money. I spent 250 USD on three pairs, out of which 2 are screwed. Will never ever buy Eagle Eyes again in my life, or the next life, or the next...."
1,Not for use at night.,"Though stated otherwise, these clip ons are not for use at night.Also, the clip that holds them to the outside of your glasses is large and very distracting."
3,I was greatly disappointed.,This pair of sunglasses do not do any better than a pair of polarized amber wrap arounds that I picked up for less than $4.00. Needless to say I was disappointed. I canot recommend these sun glasses as being any more than common polarized sunglasses.
2,great light blockers - wrong size for most,"I bought a pair of these glasses online, and they do block uv and blue light and generaly help you see clearer, but the rectangular shape and small dimensions of the sunglasses are not mentioned by the seller or made clear in the picture. The dimensions of the glasses are approximately: 55 mm (just over 2 in.) for each lens at the top tapering down to about 45 mm or less at the bottom. The ""bridge"" width is about 17 mm. Each lens is rather small and useless for round or roundish glasses. The total lenth of about 127 mm (about 5 in.) is rather small also. There are of course persons whose glasses fit these dimensions, but the sunglasses dimensions are not described for those whose glasses don't fit these dimensions.To sum up: these are great clip ons but be aware of the tiny size and irregular dimensions."
1,clip broke off within 6 days of using them,"The clip is spot welded to the thin metal bar that holds on the two lenses. Within 6 days the spot weld broke and the clip fell off. I took the Eagle flippers to an optician who looked at them and said they could not be repaired. He showed me where the tiny spot weld had broken. He expressed amazement that such a tiny spot weld was used to hold the clips on. This is the third Eagle product I have bought, and of the three items, two have broken. I would not buy products from Eagle again because they cut corners to save money. For example the Eagle sun glasses do not come with a hard case, they come with a bag that offers no protection from crushing the glasses. And the plastic frames are cheap plastic that is not adjustable, is brittle, and are too tight for my head which makes them uncomfortable to wear for more than an hour."
3,Eh.....,"This an ok toy. I don't have this breed, but I still have many dogs from the past from Animal Alley. However, Animal Alley's stuffed animals aren't exactly life-like. They all have the same eye color: brown. I prefer Douglas Cuddle Toy, for they've got much more quality. They have the best quality life-like stuffed animals ever!! I'd recommend DCT over this any day."
1,Good Deal?,"Whereas we like the product itself, I was surprised that the sticker still attached to it said $7.99 instead of the 9.99 we paid for it (without shipping). It is soft and adorable."
1,MADE IN CHINA,I returned this product. I could not give this toy to my granddaughter because it was made in China. I wish that had been noted in the product information...While it may be safe. She puts everything in her mouth so I was not Willing to take the chance.
3,Good for the price,"But my son only really likes the ring with attachments (l.right corner toy in pic) and the rattle (l.left corner). The 'wrist' rattles don't grab his attention, he's only recently started playing with the teether, and the fish just bores him.That said, Sassy toys have always been some of his favorites. I'll purchase individually from now on."
2,kind of flimsy for the price,"These seem like cute baby's first toys on the Internet, but after opening up the package, I found the toys to be kind of flimsy in construction and not worth the price. I think this set is worth maybe ten bucks, tops."
1,Shame,"The toys are great, the problem is that Sassy has been using toxic plastics in the making of their toys. I will be returning them to the company."
2,Not the best pilates pregnancy book out there,"As a Pilates instructor, I do not think this is the best book for pregnancy. There is no discussion about what is safe in each trimester, and I do not think there are enough modifications of the exercises to accommodate pregnancy (in fact, the only modified exercise is the hundreds for third trimester). Essentially, she gives the exact same exercises for each trimester and gives no information on how to modify them for an expanding belly, for safety, etc. A much better book is the Pilates Workbook for Pregnancy by King. If you already know Pilates then you dont need Winsor's book (very basic exercises that you will already know), and if you are not familiar with Pilates you should find a more detailed, safety-oriented book for your pregnancy."
2,it's ok but not great,this book is an ok book but it takes an hour or more to do all the excrecizes. also it is seperated in to each trimester that's a good feature. but in both the second and third trimester it still has you doing excrcizes while lieing on your back. no way through each of my pregnancys my doctor has said don't lay on your back after the 1st trimester. other than that the book is good it get's you in shape and it dose help alot postpartum
3,Expected More,"I just finished this book and I couldn't help but feel dissapointed when I put it down. It was an okay read (subway, under a tree, before bed), but it wasn't a ""oh my God, I can't put this book down"" kind of book. Too bad, because I think if Hamill hadn't held back some, it could have been a lot more moving."
3,"Same columnist/writer, drinking or not.","Lacking in this autobiographical examination of a ""life of drinking"" is any sense of whether the writer changed or not. It seems he hasn't. He is the same columnist today that he was when he drank. Perhaps the parts about Brooklyn might excite natives, but for outsiders,Hamill's descriptions of his youth into manhood aretedious and overwrought. While he might capture the flavor of Brooklyn neighborhoods by mentioning street corners and hangouts, he doesn't capture at all the flavor of the times Brooklyn or elsewhere. One item worth noting: to his credit, Mr. Hamill does not preach about his conversion. Dick Sheppard, Jersey City, NJ"
2,A Drinking Life,"Love Pete Hamill, just not really interested in a persons sexual exploits and his struggleswith alcohol. Happy to see he survived."
2,not the best,"Quite honestly, I expected much more from this book, but was quickly disappointed. Despite the advice found in these reviews, you can find much better books to transport you into the old days of the New York streets. If you want a real memoir to read, one that tells the true tragic story of an Irish boys life with an alcoholic father, stick to Frank McCourt's ""Angela's Ashes."" It's written better, has much more feeling, and content.Hamill whines, and complains about his life, and it's apparent that he is telling the story in a pity party circle. After reading the book, it's clear that he should just get over it, because his life isn't, and wasn't bad at all. Even his drinking problem pales in comparison to any NYC bar fly.Stick to Hamill's fiction."
4,Anything but dry!,"As an avid reader of all types of books, both fiction and non-fiction, I have come to appreciate an extraordinary work. On the strong recommendation of radio personality Don Imus, I recently purchased and read ""A Drinking Life"", by Pete Hamill. This is an extraordinary work. Written with the grit, honesty, and street-smarts that have become his journalistic trademark, the book is often touching, occasionally hilarious, and always straight from the heart. Hamill is truly one of the gifted writers of our time. I highly recommend this courageous, witty, gritty memoir, a helluva good time. And a treasure. I would be shocked if anyone read this book and did not become an instant fan of Mr. Hamill. (Add a star if you grew up in, or currently reside in any of the New York City boroughs)."
2,"Living with drinking, not a drinking life","Admittedly, Pete Hamill's A Drinking Life has its moments. His descriptions of his native Brooklyn can make even this Canadian boy feel nostalgic. There is no doubt that Mr. Hamill's life has been an interesting one. Interesting, but certainly not defined by his penchant for alcohol. While the title would seem to promise some sort of examination of his own alcoholism (if that is what his thirst can really be called), it is gradually reduced to a tone of deep melodrama when Hamill reveals himself as not really addicted, just kind of thirsty. In the final ten pages, the author boasts that he simply ""gave up"" booze: never went to AA, never sought any kind of help, just quit. Such ease of recovery forces readers to wonder whether drinking was in fact the defining activity Hamill claims it was, or simply one in a series of selfish actions."
2,Diappointing read,"Quite frankly, I don't understand all the glowing reviews of this book. Hamill writes very well, and apparently has excellent memories of his childhood. And that's why I didn't care for this book; more than 2/3 of this book deals with his childhood. Also, he delves into his teenage years and his sexual experiences in graphic detail; I didn't buy this book to read about that.A much better read is his ""Why Sinatra Matters"", one of the very best books I've ever read about my idol...that book I rate 5 stars, but not ""A Drinking Life""."
5,fabulous,The Karmababy sling is fabulous. It is very comfortable to wear and easy to use. My four-week-old loves being able to be close while I am active with my 2 year old and being able to look around. Nursing was a little tricky in the sling at first but after a few practice sessions nursing became much easier.
3,"A drive-in style movie,barf bags included!","I still have one of the barf bags they handed out before I first saw hs at the drive-in in the 80's. There were also red flashes to warn people with ""weak hearts"" of the gore scenes. It doesn't quite live up to the hype,but it is pretty gory for 1974. Most of the gore consists of hearts getting torn from peoples chests by a monster that comes out on full moon nights. If youy're like me,you'd love this film just 'cause of the hype. I think this is better then many of the early to mid 70's horror films out there,if you're a true horror fan,this is worth checkin' out."
5,A good book,The book is brand new and I was with the Panama with American for bananas gurading the train did kill a guy for burning the bananas on te train. All of you should read the book is very good.
5,Great practice tool,"Got this set for practicing without driving the wife nuts, it works! Softens the sound, but keeps it's tones so you can work on your beats. Takes only a few minutes to install, but well worth it."
4,Sensitive ears,"The parents of the drummer think these are great. It muffles enough to not drive everyone crazy, however, if the walls of your house are thin, you may not think so. Mom especially appreciates the cymbal pads."
3,Good set of mutes,"Bought these for my son when he started playing. Cuts sound down, not completely and it does change the pitch of the notes. Good idea for those in small spaces and want to play longer without disturbing neighbors. I would recommend looking into the sound absorbing tiles for your walls for the long run before I would buy these though."
2,Do not buy!!,"The first problem is the smell. They have a VERY strong rubber smell that lasts for about a week. Second, although it silences some of the drums it changes the pitch and sound so much its completely different. The only ones it works well for are the high hat and bass drum, it quiets them and keeps the same tone. For the snare, it is barely quieter, but a much much higher pitch sound. The toms are quieted but again a WAYYY higher pitched tune. When you put these on the snare and toms, its not even worth playing because the pitch/tone is so off. So if you are learning drumming or just want to learn a new song these make it so much harder because the drums are not the right pitch. For the ride cymbal; it just just sounds like you're hitting a piece of rubber. And for the crash it turns into a loud, sharp, quick, and annoying sound, but not any quieter. Only get these as an absolute last resort! if you have to quiet the drumset get an electric kit, or put acoustic foam over the walls."
3,All WHAT Hits?,"Mungo Jerry had one hit - ""In the summertime"". How can a band that went through more members than albums have this many different best of collections? If, like me, you received this album for free then display it proudly and look aghast when people ask ""Who are they?!""There may be a few people in the world who have to own every album with Mungo Jerry songs. Knock yourself out. Seriously, the 2004 Best of album also contains 16 songs, more than half of them different selections. I think they make this up just to market another album, like syndicating Gilligan's Island for 30 years."
4,TRU the original,This album is real raw but you see where it all starts. I wonder what happened to all the people featured on this album.
5,Stellar Performer,"Immediately, I was taken by the sound quality of this instrument. Since I had already tested the product at a local retailer, I knew what I was getting. I have absolutely no regrets; it's a stellar performer."
2,Bad quality - Problems with the keys,"I live in Venezuela and bought the keyboard through Amazon because he was cheaper than to buy it in my country and I thought that the quality of the product was superior. Nevertheless, the product that Amazon sent to me is defective, the complete last 10 keys of the acute notes don't work because they are hard and they don't emit any sound.I'm really very disappointed and annoying with the purchase of this product.Now I'll have to fix it in Venezuela because to give back it to Amazon will duplicate the cost (shipment plus Venezuelan tariffs and taxes).Don't recommend the product."
4,Good keyboard,"Don't buy this keyboard if you want thousands of sounds. You get the basics with this one: 2 grands, 2 electrics, 2 organs, harpsichord, vibraphone, bass, strings. I love this keyboard; the only negative is the sledgehammer-like thunking sound the keys make when you release 'em."
5,excellent keyboard!,"I bought this keyboard for my daughter in lieu of a real piano for lack of space. The weighted keys give it the feel of a real piano, and it is full-sized, but portable. It also has excellent quality sound - I highly recommend this product if you cannot afford a real piano, or if you don't have space for one."
3,Pretty good but not a piano,"I would give this 3 - 4 stars.I bought this item to fit into my very small New York apartment - (I have a grand piano in a country house). Once I got used to it, I enjoyed it - it has a very good tone and touch (weighted keys), but there is a slight problem in that there is an underlying 'clacking' sound to the keys, which I find a little annoying. Also, the pedal is somewhat disappointing. All the same, I like it and am very pleased to have it."
3,Casio Privia PX110,"The piano is just okay. The speakers are weak, but sounds nice with headphones on. The keys are quite noisy while playing which can be distracting and takes away from the joy of playing, but, again, with headphones on it is not so noticeable."
1,OK until it broke,"I bought a Casio PX-110 as a Christmas present for my 15 year old grandson who was learing to play the piano. After 10 months of careful use a single key stopped functioning correctly. I had the credit card receipt for the purchase, but not the original sales receipt. I sent Casio the paperwork I had plus a notarized letter on the circumstances of the purchase, per their request. Casio says they didn't receive the documents and would not repair it under warranty. They wanted to charge me $257.00 to repair one key, which I declined to do, fearing another key would break, and bought a Yamaha keyboard instead. I feel that it is a serious quality problem when a keyboard breaks in less than a year, and a design problem when it costs over $250 to reair a simple problem."
5,Great sound for this price,"I purchased this after a bit of research, and found that the Casio PX series is pretty highly reviewed. I was looking for an inexpensive piano that had a realistic sound and feel, and was full length. The PX110 fit the bill.The sound is really nice from this digital piano, although the speakers are NOT very good. The sound is excellent through my headphones. I hook mine up to some different speakers when I play for others, and it sounds great.It doesn't have a lot of special features, but I wasn't looking for anything that did. The weighted keys do have some ""clack"" noise when you press them, but since they're weighted, I kind of expected that.The only thing I don't like about it is the sustain pedal. It works well, but the sound it makes when the plastic is pressed is loud and distracting. I purchased a different one from [...]"
5,Very nice keyboard for the price,"The keyboard is great. The kids like to practice more now than on the grand piano (mostly because they can use headphones so everyone isn't listening). The speakers are a little weak--through headphones or an external amp it sounds much better. I like the touch of the keys. They are a little noisy, but not any different than other electronic keyboards with weighted keys I've tried. I couldn't believe the price. Very satisified with this purchase."
1,3 keys broken!!! Really disappointed!!!,"I bought this trivia from amazon, I really happy when the trivia came less than 1 week, but when I tried to play it, there are 3 keys that is not come back, it's still like being pressed, even tough I don't press it, and then there are no sounds to one of the keys...I really dissapointed. Amazon said it is new, but now I cannot play some songs because the 3 keys I cannot play...I don't know how to repair it to who and I read here there are person that complain the same thing, the key is not properly...Amazon should be responsible, if it said 'NEW', it should all working properly...but the 3 keys already broken when I opened the package...Really dissapointed.."
5,my favorite Sherlock Holmes story,I can never understand why this epic story hasn't been put onto film yet. It's such a great story and it's wonderfully narrated by Simon Prebble who's the best when it comes to Sherlock Holmes. A great addition to anyone's Holmes library.
1,Not what we were hoping for at all,"The ""board"" is thin and simply unrolls. It retains the rolled shape for a long time and was really cheaply made. We ended up having to replace it with a different board. Not impressed."
2,Not for self-study,"This book is not suitable for self-study. Nowhere in the editorial review did it say this, so I thought I'd put it out there. All of the questions and comparative thinking sections are meant for a native or advanced Spanish speaker to answer for you. The answers are not found anywhere."
5,"A neglected subject, fascinating treatment.","This is a fascinating and well written account of one of the best known, yet little understood, archaeological mysteries of the century. The discovery of the first-century grave under the present basilica of St Peter's is a detective story which is usually given a confessional treatment, if it is noted at all. Walsh does a brilliant job of untangling the threads of the excavation, without making assumptions about the religious aspects of the find. He leaves the reader in little doubt that what was discovered was what Christinas from the second century on certainly believed to be the grave of the apostle Peter. As for the bones, he makes a reasonable case for those being revered in the time of Constantine, without claiming that they are, or are not, those of the Prince of the Apostles. Whatever one's faith, this is a book to be read in one sitting. Anyone going to Rome should definitely read this before visiting the site."
4,A fascinating account,"A fascinating account of the search for the the final resting place of the first Pope's body. Combined with photographs and diagrams, the author's easy-to-read text reveals a truly interesting, and entertaining even, search."
5,Captivating Children's story,"I gave this book to my 8 year old niece who was captivated by the story and chose it for her first book report. She confided in me that she wanted to be ""just like Aubyn."""
4,Miriams Well was a very emotional and explanitory book.,Miriams well presented a lot of religous baracades that can keep the public from outer life. Miriams well shows signs of all people and how open they are to the modern world.
3,Decent book,I was shocked by all of the 5 star ratings for this book.It is not a book that I will regret reading but it is not a book that i would highly recommend.I was a little let down with the climax that came crashing down into nothing.
1,Not intriguing or believable.,"I agree with an earlier reviewer, the 5 star ratings on here must be from friends of the author.This book was not believable or intriguing. A 15 year old main character grew tedious after about 100 pages. The whole thing seemed painfully unlikely. Skip this one."
2,If you have time,"I am not an avid reader and when I decided to read this book based on reviews I was highly disappointed. I can watch this plot on TV. If you have the time, then great, read it. I would have rather read something more deep, historical, and poetic. Sorry, not my recommendation."
5,Excellent Read!,This book was fantastic. I wasn't able to put it down until I finished it. I immediately cared about the characters and couldn't wait to find out what happened to them. The wording was highly descriptive without being verbose and the storyline was absolutely captivating. The unanticipated twists and turns kept me reading and reading. John Searles has done a great job with his first published novel! I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a great story.
2,Novel Still Missing,I ordered this book b/c I saw that it had received almost 5 stars. I was quite unimpressed. A 15 year old boy has sex in the room where his mother died with a kidnapped one month old lying quietly nearby. A little ridiculous as is the rest of the book.
2,Ok story that was a slow read,Was expecting more of a Who dunnit thriller which this story is clearly not. Dominick Pindle is a 15 yr.old boy going thru some severe family issues with his mother & father as well as the hardships of entering adulthood. Its a sad story that hightlights the downfalls when people do not communicate with each other. Some of the actions of Dominick were implausible.
5,Great Resource for expanding your classroom!,"This is a wonder book/resource on how to approach lessons in the classroom to account for multiple intelligences. I just borrowed this book from the library to use for a paper, and just loved all the information in it that I am now going to purchase is to use for my classroom. The information is so well written and laid out in a manner that is easy to follow whether you are quickly skimming through or sitting down to read it cover to cover. I strongly recommend this book for any teacher wishing to expand their students' learning experiences."
5,It's very useful to me,"This book is very useful to me.How to develop students' eight intelligences and teach basic skills through multiple modes. I think this book is anchor full of valuable classroom exercises, resources, and ideas for interdisciplinary units. ^^"
5,BEST GUITAR & SYNTHESIZER ALBUM ..,"I DON'T REMEMBER HOW MANY TIMES I HEARED THIS CD. MAYBE HUNDREDS IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL AND ROMANTIC, SIMPLY THE BEST MUSIC A PERSON CAN BUY FOR HIMSELF OR FOR FRIENDS.THIS IS A MASTERPIECE THAT WILL REMAIN AS A CLASSIC AS TIME GOES BY.THE MOST POWERFUL COMBINATION OF ACOUSTIC GUITARS AND SYNTHESIZERS EVER CREATED."
5,Wonderful!!,"Feels your heart with joy!!!!!!! the music of this album is beautiful, makes every day of your life a better day."
3,"The only song that ""grabbed"" me was ""Quiver""","I have two other CD's by Chris Spheeris and I like only 1 or 2 songs on each, but I like them a lot. ""Quiver"" is a stand-out. Reminds me of Keiko Matsui."
3,"Good, but pads kept falling off","The headsets are fantastic. The sound is better than any headset I have ever had and I forget they are even over my ears. The bad thing is the foam pad kept falling off so I needed to buy replacements. Other than that, the headsets are awesome!"
1,Not impressed with product.,"The headphones were not blue, which is what I ordered. I do not notice any extra bass.Not that impressed with this item."
1,This product is a real disappointment,It is supposed to have skip protection but it constantly cuts off whenever it is not level and stable so it is no good to use while walking or moving about. A real disappointment.
5,Great,Just what I thought it would be. For any one that wants CDs played in the car its great lot of fun
4,personal coby cd player.,I find it is easier to use for my audio cd's my other ones are cody's and I also enjoyed using th3m it is easy to put in a pocket and use it any where.
5,Good price good performance,I bought two of these. One for my wife and one for her friend. They both worked great. No skipping and good sound quality for an inexpensive portable unit.
1,Terrible from first try,I was excited for this new player for basic use. I am not happy with how often it skips. I have ice issues from day one. Should have spent more money on a nicer player.
4,Coby portable CD player,"Love the size, but the readout is too small to read, the buttons are grey on grey cannot read, sound is great thru head phones AND it works with, small portable speakers."
5,Colby CD player,I use these CD players in my kindergarten classroom for books on CD. They work great and prove to be durable. My kindergartner's use them every day and the first one that I bought is two years old and still running strong.
1,CD play stopped working,"I purchased a Coby Cxcd329 Slim Personal CD Player, which stopped working after a week. I am quite disappointed, and the manufacturer requires $6.00 to return it, plus I would have to pay shipping. It does not seems worth it to go through this, since I only paid $19.00. Needless to say, I am quite disappointed."
3,"Cheap, cheap, cheap",I have never seen such an inexpensively manufactured product. It is amazing that it works but it does. I use mine to play cd's before i go to sleep. It does the job. I would never think that it could go on the road for a walk or a bike ride; it would just not function.
1,idont waste your money,It never worked...button was depressed and never came up so couldn't get it to open or turn on..junk..and not worth sending back so another waste of my money on electronics via amazon.com.
3,Coby Well It's Alright,The Headphones Do Break Very Easily and the Player itself is Alright but Not at Al the Best! So it Won't Last Long!
3,"It worked, kinda","I bought this for the purpose of having music while I mow the grass. I have tried other portable systems to play CD's and with the vibration it just won't work. As this did not work either. Where I mow it is rougher than the normal lawn so in all fairness I can't say there is anything wrong with the player. And it did work where the other systems failed. You just can't pound the devil out of it and keeps working. The sound was fine, but that must have a lot to do with the ear phones you use. And I am afraid I can't even tell you about battery life because it failed shortly after I started mowing. Again where I mow it can get tough. At times I am actually on two wheels. For what it is worth I have always had great luck with Coby items when they are used for what they are intended. And I mean for the price I thought why not try it."
1,coby cd player,The cd player that I purchased will drain the batteries and not complete one song. @2min. then shuts down. Coby model cx-cd329 portable cd player.
3,works but cheap,"I bought this product so I could listen to CD's while in bed. When I got the CD out of the box and attempted to use it, I had to readjust the headphone jack several times to get the sound to work on both sides. The place to put in the batteries was cheap plastic and will break easily if mishandled. This product does work, but, you must handle with care for fear of breakage. I feel this product will at most last a year because it is made so cheaply. If you want a CD player then pay a little extra to get one that is made better."
1,One can do better,"I received two of the CD players beecause of a delay in shipping. I overpaid. The construction is barely there, the anti-skip protection is non-existent. On an enviromental standpoint the player EATS batteriers. You can do better."
5,It does the job,"Low investment, high return! The little player comes with a headset. Nothing fancy, but it works exactly as I had expected. The batteries don't last too long...maybe only 3-4 hours, but that might be due to my choice of batteries.Good product for the price."
2,Not so pleased,"This item skipped at the lightest movement & the sound was not good at all. I gave it away. I purchased a different CD player. I have had 2 Coby CD players & have been dissatisfied with them both. I won't buy Coby again, no matter how cheap. You get what you pay for!"
1,"Spend a little more, get a lot more.","I purchased this cd player a year or so ago. I thought that by now the other brands like Coby would have caught up to mainstream brands in quality, I saved about $20 in this transaction.*This cd player won't play anything but perfect cd's, the slightest scratch sends it into spasms which are reduced by turning the skip protection off, ironically.*There is no external power plug*Player takes forever to spin up, and an eternity if it sees a scratch.I am going to have to go out and buy another cd player because this one certainly isn't any good. It does not work like it should, so spare yourself the pain and get a better product."
4,pretty good...,I've had this discman for a few years now and it is just now starting to skip/glitch. It has worked well up to now so I just bought another to replace it.
2,"Yep, it's crap","Not much in the way of features, and some of them don't work. The headphone jack shorts out if you move around, the anti-skip function is worthless, and it's picky about the CDs it will play. Save your money."
2,good product when it isn't broken...,"good sound quality, about as good as a $40 sony player, except it doesn't seem to last more than a month or so...I got 1 from my local Entertainment-and-other-stuff retailer and it wouldn't even read a disc. I exchanged it for another, per their return policy, and it lasted 3 weeks or thereabouts. Fortunately I was able to get a refund in the form of store credit instead of exchanging it again, but yeah...sucks that sound quality doesn't get much better than this, at least as far as I can tell..."
1,Did not work,I agree you get what you pay for and this was for nothing. It does not work.. very frustrating but I should have realized it was too cheap. Not sure how to give it no stars...TW
4,Lourdes: Shrine of miracles,"I think this is an interesting documentary.But I'd recommend you also buy one of the following movies: ""Bernadette"" or ""The Song of Bernadette"".These movies will give you an even better insight in what exactly happened over there in Lourdes to Bernadette."
4,A Real Hit to the Funny Bone!,"Zingers is a book of all one-line sayings guaranteed to stick out in the course of conversation, or make a lasting point in your written works. From serious to downright hilarious, ""Zingers"" is a book for those searching for the right thing to say at the right time--in a witty and wonderfully wacky way. Like it says- from ""Ambition to Zeal"", this book has got it all."
4,Entertaining and useful,"This book not just a handy resource, but the best part is just flipping through and reading one here or there. A fun coffee table book."
4,Love them,"I love the lights, i ordered 4 for all my light outside. They look expensive and they will hold up for years. I love amazon's prices."
1,Broken Globes,"I ordered 3 of these. The electricians installed them, but one had a broken globe. I was told about the problem after they were installed. I sent it back and was sent a replacement. That one also arrived with a broken globe. I sent that one back and obtained a third one. That one was okay. I would not have kept the product except I had paid the electrician for his service call. Very disappointed with these lights."
4,Monster trucks,"My nephew loves monster trucks and he is only two. They are a little smaller than I hoped, but still safe for him. Hotwheeles are usually pretty durable, so I think this is a pretty good product."
4,School Book!,"Book was in excellent condition upon arrival and was just as described!! The shipping took a little longer than expected/hoped (although It got here sooner than the computer estimated), but other than that everything went very smooth..."
3,"Was Okay, could've been better","This book was okay, believable characters but there wasn't much depth. It was good if you had nothing else to read. The best thing was the dynamics between the two women, without that there would not have been much worth reading. I just did not think the writing style was great."
5,A Must for Drivers of All Ages,"'Driving Survival' is a must read for anybody who gets behind the wheel, regardless of how much experience you think you have. Jim MacPherson has crafted an easy-to-read AAA Auto Guide that will open your eyes. It had handy information on topics as varied as increased rollover risk, the correct way to adjust your mirrors (I had been doing it wrong for more than 20 years) and what to look for when purchasing a car. The book is also laid out well with clear, concise graphics and loads of sidebars. It's the type of book you read from cover to cover or use as a reference manual. You won't regret purchasing this book. It could save your life or the life of a loved one."
3,PowerBall - Is it worthed?,I bought this in hope to be able to clean/polish my alloy wheels fast. I have some high end OZ wheels with 17 spokes (!). It takes me usually 20min just to clean the wheels. The product is a fantastic polisher but not a cleaner. Using a soft brush and elbow grease it will probably yeald better results. The Mini Powerball started to shred after first use. Maybe its me that I dont know how to use the product. I have not tried the PowerBall being afraid that the results would be disappointing. The power Metal polish works great just with a rag and a buffing mitt. I am now looking at Mothers' web site or experts to get idea on how to properly use the tool to get the best effect. 3 Stars its all I can give due to the extra work I had to do which would be cut in half by using a brush instead.
4,Best of Billie Davis,"Really good if you are a devoted Billie Davis fan. Most of her well known recordings are on this, but she doesn't have that'punch' in her voice, it's all been tempered down.But having said that, I enjoy listening to this, and I'm not a devoted fan."
3,"Good effort, now let's go one better!",She recorded what to this day is the definitive version of Chip Taylor's gorgeous Angel of the Morning. Her re-recorded version here does her credit but now we need the original 1968 production in all it's glory. She deserves much better but this is welcome while we await a collection of her original recordings remastered. Great under-rated voice.
5,This is the definitive work on America's great jazz legend.,"If you love Bix, you'll love this book. It out classes all other efforts in the field. The research was exhaustive and directed toward getting the truest picture possible of our #1 jazz legend. The text is a bit broken up by the intrusion of quotations from sources, but that is the price of authenticity. For those who know and love Bix's music, the book is a must. For those who don't know his music, the book should make the reader curious enough to listen to him. I cannot recommedn it too highly."
2,Basic,This is a basic massage video. You watch the couple give a basic massage. Nothing you wouldn't already know how to do in the first place.
5,Powerline Wavemaster Review,"I started cardio kickboxing this spring, and they use the Powerline Wavemasters for more than half of the class time. I couldn't get enough. I had to order one for myself to use at home during my ""off"" days. I ordered mine straight through Centruy and it is awesome. Even in class, on padded mats, the bags will move around as you work on them. So I also recommend the ""shadow boxing"" technique where you move around the bag as you work out. This is only for thoes of us who ""go at it 100 miles an hour"" because there are some ladies in my class who never move the bag at all from punches or kicks. For my home model, I have it on carpet, and I went and purchased a sheet of that non slip grip rubber material and put it under mine. Works great keeping it in one place."
3,Wavemaster - should be more stable,Overall a good work-out companion. Needs to be more stable. Filled with water the wavemaster moved around all over the place. Filled with sand it stays in place a bit more. Filled with sand it moves slightly with my punches. Kicks forget it...unless up against a wall
3,what a blunder,The product was fine. It is a stable punching bag. Just very large. I actually did not get the bag that I originally ordered. I have the wave master xxl. The problem was the distributor. This product took almost 2 months to receive properly. This was supposed to be a holiday gift. I ordered the gift in plenty of time and received the final product in mid January. After MULTIPLE excuses and really poor customer service I finally had a punching bag with a bunch of extra bases that took an extra two weeks to get rid of. This was a comedy of errors.
1,MORE NO LIMIT ARTIFACTS,"Okay, before I start this review, I have to tell everyone this album was made in the pre-historic days of No Limit. This is before all the platinum success, and cartoony production.Now I will start my review. Mama's Bad Boy was Master P's second album released on the small independent label In A Minute. The lyrics are of less than average standards. And the production is ridiculous. It sticks to the looped up Marvin Gaye samples and cheap synthesizer sounds. This is partly due to the fact that Master P is in the production credits, and he did a majority of the albums production [sorry, no KLC or Carlos Stephens here]. The only half-way decent tracks are ""Shoot 'Em Up"", and ""I'm Going Big Time"". This is only recommended for hardcore No Limit fans and those looking for the man before the success."
2,Stupid !!,"This Telenovela is already interesant but it is such a stupid history,so illogical, too much death,too much killing and it is so stupid, and it is fantasy. waste of time!!"
2,Sooo Boring,"I love Gina Gershon as much as the next guy or gal, but this was soooooo boring.I think she is a beautiful and charismatic performer, but the behind the scenes material here is like watching someone's home movies...sooo boring. I wanted more of Lovedog's music,less of the band ,her assistant,guitar tech, road manager and yes..... less Gina. A straight concert performance would have been much more satisfying."
3,Her Rock,"Her Rock.(http://www.geocities.jp/ecoshistar/ggrock.html)Women take the tools, the reason.It is for baby child the education.Thanks Gina, the show."
4,Slow Delivery,Slow delivery. The bag on one of the cartridges was opened and one was sealed. Product works.
1,Second Review,"Good afternoon,I already sent you a review. Never got the item, amount was refunded to my cc. I received a very bad customer service from company selling the computer, cause never received any mail or notification that they were out of stock, (after confirmation was sent to me that the order was approved)BrgdsP.Ribera"
4,Nice job Sony,"I recently bought this and its my first Laptop, I actually like this Vaio a lot. Nice screen, not too heavy, EXCELLENT PRICE, nice speed & memory and multiple options to play with. The only problem is that without warning the screen goes to the previous page and am not sure what to do with that.otherwise I think its wonderful machine for its price, come on ""ITS A SONY""..."
3,"Nice, but not multimedia friendly, if you need sound","This is a handsome laptop with lots of functionality, but the speakerscan barely be heard - even at full volume. Whats worse, is the soundis terribly distorted at full volume, forcing one to find a balancesomewhere between crummy sound and no sound.Great for the library, but don't plan on watching DVD's orplaying mp3's on this unit."
2,Not for PST,"DO NOT BUY THIS FOR THE PST! This item would be great for a much larger knife but could fit 2 PST's (Personal Survival Tools) in it. I should have been very careful to read the measurements but I did read in the detailed specs that this product was for the PST. Saying that this product fits the PST is like saying that a shoe box fits an egg. When I contacted the seller they stated very coldly, that they posted the measurements but had no response to my inquiry of why they stated that this thing fit the PST. They gave me a return number to send it back and 2 pages of regulations stating that the package must be unopened among many other things. How would you know it fit unless you tried it? Any way I would send it back but the return shipping is more than the product is worth (they know that!) I am very unsatisfied with the seller! Gave this 2 stars because although this rides high on the belt, it may be good for whatever monster it is supposed to carry. It is not the PST!"
3,good chocie,"This book covers all the everyday aspecs of life, in a very peculiar way that involves you with the manin charachter in a fraternity with space and universe"
1,?????,"I don't understand what's ""celestial"" about this collection. Not bad songs, but not the best either; these songs have been heard so many times already on so many other compilations for this, that, and the other. But what truly boggles my mind is how these selections are supposed to relate to the concept of a ""celestial celebration""???? Does not compute O_o"
4,surprisingly good,"Compilation cds are usually kind of corny because they're usually full of the same ole top 40 pop hits, but I was surprised at how enjoyable this one was. I recognized some songs and was enthralled with some new ones.It's moody and varied and features some great female talent. It's like a mixed cd one of my girlfriends might make me with a random shuffle of artists she has saved on her realplayer.I pop it into my car whenever I get sick of waiting for the radio to play something intelligible."
2,No celebration.,Was not like the older albums they produced. Played it once and I think I left it somewhere. No great lose.
3,Not the Greatest Quality,"I will have to agree with the other review that this item is not very well made, but the size is perfect for my little one and the color is the color that he asked for from Santa so those are the only reasons that I ordered this item. I do not see it lasting very long at all. Word of Caution is absolutely is shipped in the original packaging, a guitar shaped box with the picture on front so if this is a suprise you may want to look elsewhere. The first guitar I received was crushed mainly b/c of the box that it is shipped in there is no protection for the poor little guitar. The seller immediately sent out a new guitar and did not require me to send the damaged one back. That should tell you about how much they have tied up in the product when they dont require the damaged item back at all."
1,Don't buy this product.,The guitar actually broke in half while trying to tighten the strings. I don't know that there is anything else to say after that.
1,Don't buy this guitar!,"This guitar is TERRIBLE - it is very cheaply made, has horrible sound and is a waste of money. Try Back to Basics Toys and their guitar for little ones."
1,Can't hold a tune,"Despite all my musician son's efforts to get this little guitar functional for his 3-year old, the strings would get out of tune after a few strums. I know it's a toy, but had hoped it would perform a little better."
2,More for a toddler,I bought this guitar for my son who is 5. It is made horrible. The strings all broke after 1 week and the strap would not stay on the guitar at all. This is more of a toy for a 2 year old and is not worth the money .
2,Awful,"This guitar came to me with things missing. I have a son who was looking forward getting this and when we got it he could not even play it!! It was a mess there was chips in the paint the ""nut"" or also know as the top bridge was missing and without that you can't even play the thing. So I guess what I get for the price I paid for it. I will have better luck going to Wal-Mart and buying a new one. I don't recommend this to anyone with kids or getting it for a special gift like birthdays it will hurt their feelings like it did my son. I will never buy from here ever again."
2,Not very durable,This product was not very durable. It broke the same day we got it. The strings are metal but are not very well attached to the tuners. I would not recommend this product.
3,Unable to actually use the strap,"I purchased this guitar for a 2 year old specifically because he wanted a guitar with a strap.While this guitar is not ideal for actually playing music since the strings wont stay tuned, it was really just for holding and pretending to 'rock out'. It came with the flimsy gig bag and other accessories but the fact that this instrument does not have a peg on the bottom on which i could actually attach the strap, renders it basically unusable- unless of course i drop another 8 or 9 dollars on the peg at a guitar store, and install it myself. For that price difference, i could have bought a better product with a ready to use strap.Disappointed in the lack of candor from this seller."
3,Comes with nice extras,"This is a very cheaply made guitar. The strings wouldn't stay wound and my husband had to glue the string guide back on as it was attached crooked. Also, the holes that the strings rest in are too shallow and he had to cut the grooves deeper so we could tune the guitar. We kept it because the extras it came with were nice and worth the money we spent. It's good enough for use as a toy/beginner item."
2,Nice gift for younger child,"I was impressed with the quality and look of the guitar purchased formy 6 yr. old nephew. The zippers on the case was broken on arrival andthere were no instructions for attaching the strap to the guitar, or anybasic guitar instructions."
1,Too Small,"The Guitar was the size of a ukulele. It did not go over well with my 4 year old. It was way too small. I bought it because his older brother had a guitar, but this was too small to really look like a guitar for my son.Beyond that it was fine, but not what I was looking for"
1,"Looks like a guitar, but doesn't make a sound","I was really disappointed with this guitar. When it arrived my son was so excited, but when he tried to play it there was no sound. My husband attempted to tune it, but said the issue was there was no space between the guitar and the strings. It was a total waste of money for us. I would not recommend this at all."
2,lasted a week,"you are better off getting a plastic guitar with batteries. It came apart after a week, not really playable, I had to fix it before it could even be used for the first time."
4,"not great, but useable...","There are lots of complaints about this guitar. It's cheap, the components are flimsy, the strings are basically unusable, but here's the thing: there are ways that you can make it a completely functional child's or toy guitar. The tuners have phillips head screws on the back. If they don't stay put, just tighten the screws! If the bridge slips when you replace the strings or de-tune them for any reason, crazy glue it into place! I am going to put some uke strings on it so it sounds goofy and hawaiian. not a guitar i would gig with, but if you are going to pay less than 30 bucks for a musical instrument, than you have to expect that it isn't going to be a beautiful piece of work. with a little modding, it can be more than it is out of the box."
2,"Very cheaply made, but what do you expect for 20 bucks","It doesn't look as pictured and has a hollow sound, even if it is a beginner childrens guiter."
2,Looks good but doesn't play a tune,This guitar looks like a mini acoustic but the bridge is not even glued into place and you cannot tune the strings at all. My 3 yo is going to be disappointed. Cannot believe how cheap this guitar is!
3,Carrying Bag,"It doesn't look as pictured and has a hollow sound, even if it is a beginner childrens guiter. This was with some pretty gentle handling, so I'm wondering what it will do in the hands of a five-year-old, and how long the peeling will continue."
1,Nice little guitar if it wasn't broken!,"I bought this for my nephew for Christmas & they didn't get up here till after the holiday. All I kept telling him was I had a really special gift this year for him & he was so excited. After he opened it, the first look on his face was priceless he was so happy. As we took the plastic off & turned it over we seen that the neck was totally cracked off!! He started crying because he couldn't play it. I am so unhappy about this. I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't broke!!"
3,Peeling Paint,"I ordered this for one of my grandchildren for Christmas. Looks like a great little toy guitar, but when I held it and turned the knobs to tighten the strings I noticed some of the paint from the neck of the guitar was peeling and sticking to my hands. This was with some pretty gentle handling, so I'm wondering what it will do in the hands of a five-year-old, and how long the peeling will continue."
4,Cutest thing Ever!,"Gave this to my 3 year old for Christmas. Awesome! He has grown up around real guitars, so he knows how to treat it with respect. I would recommend this to anyone who has patience with real instruments. Reguardless of how great I think it is, it is still a toy. We have had a few issues with tuning the strings, but we think we can work around it. It is the perfect size for preschoolers. All in all what a great buy!"
4,fun for kids,"i bought this guitar for my son's 3rd birthday. he loved it! still plays with it a year later. he started taking guitar lessons from his daycare with this. in fact started a trend because soon after all the other kids were looking for mini guitars, but were buying some that were too big and too expensive. this was just right. the bag that it comes with is incredibly cheap and ripped but whatever, it is for a childs toy. just be careful with it. also had to have it tuned, that should be expected."
