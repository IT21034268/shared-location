1,The whole premise is a joke....,"Who exactly is forcing these people to go down the road of competitive, for pay athletics? And what exactly is stopping these multi millionaire athletes from becoming owners themselves? Starting a new league? Branching off into other enterprises that would create opportunities for others? The athlete, with rare exceptions, enters into these agreements with universities and pro sports teams of their own free will, and if they don't prepare economically for a future that doesn't include pro sports, they have no one but themselves to blame. Rhoden wishes these athletes were ""slaves"" so people would more buy in to his spew about racism in society...doesn't seem like the ""unfairness"" he laments hurt the pursuit of his dreams any..."
3,Misnomer,"The title ""Vitaphone Cavalcade of Musical Comedy"" is really a misnomer! This 6-disc set has very few of what I would call MUSICAL comedies... Most of it is actually early Vitaphone shorts - some of them taken from early silent footage (albeit with a musical background from the Vitaphone studios) and a few are not even comedies! The title should have been ""Early Vitaphone Shorts, Volume 1""... Nonetheless, I found it enjoyable, and - yes - I'm hoping they will release more of them!"
1,DISAPPOINTED,I receive this book 2 days ago and I ordered this book like three weeks before! When I got this book is so old! Since I saw the status said use but like new! Awww!! I want to return this book!! Which way can i return it?
5,Just what I ordered!,I received the calendar in plenty of time for Chrismas and in excellent shape. Thank you so much!
3,Great Product; Not great service,"I'm happy with the quality of the cap, but had problems with service. I had ordered this with expedited shipping. Took about 8 days before they notified me part of the order was back ordered. I asked if they could change shipping or ship partial orders. My questions were not responded to. I finally got my order over 2 weeks later and was still charged premium (almost 50% of purchase price) for expediting shipment."
2,It's decent....,"The product is okay, but the quality is lacking. The cardboard inside the visor is very thin. The cloth is thin, it's just a cheaply made product. Compare to other military caps I own, it's very flimsy."
3,Great Price,"Cheap, no problems. I don't completely understand why it took over two weeks to ship, but I was told it up front, so whatever. I'd recommend."
5,A Treasure of Wisdom,"An inspiring explanation of eight potent verses, the only writings left to us by Lord Chaitanya. Swamiji has made these beautiful words come alive. I found it difficult to put down, even when I knew I had to get to sleep! And rereading it later, I found even more value in it."
5,Cute!!,"This doll is cute and unlike most bratz is appropriate. She dosen't have a ton of makeup like other bratz, just enogh. I recommend this this doll!!!"
5,"Science fiction analogy to ""Lord of the Flies.""","Both ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""Eden"" deal with the transformations in behavior/culture after the thin layer of civilization is stripped away.Eden is a slow build to a fast finish. The ending satisfies and, at the same time, leaves you wanting more. Though intellectually and emotionally complete, the finale leaves you wondering what the next phase of evolution will be.Highly recommended for everyone -- and in particular, anyone interested in spiritual and societal evolution."
5,Extravagant Praise,Absolutely essential reading for woman priests and ministers helping us redefine on a new level expansions of the sacraments we love.
3,Good premise,"I enjoyed the premise of the book, so I bought it. By the end, though, I felt that it diluted into every other chick-lit book. It was still a fun read."
4,a fast read,This was my first Valerie Frankel book. I enjoyed it and read it within a couple of days.. It is a change from the murder mystery/suspense novels that I usually read. I thought it was nice not to have to think so hard and just to enjoy the story! I will read more Frankel books in the future!
2,Did you all read the SAME book..it was BORING,"UGH yet another waste of time. it was slow/boring and took forever for me to read. I am serious when I say that I am SHOCKED you all like it so..I could not wait to finish it. it was not as bad as Wolves In Chic Clothing but it was pretty useless in my opinion. I had to finish it because thats the way I am... but what a waste of time....pass this over..it was not intresting at all.. basically ""girl finds love,friends and a rat infested house.."" THE ENDI had no motivation to read it at all"
3,nice but cliche,"Perhaps what is amazing is that the world turns out prodigies year after year in unexpected places and Mr. Kempf seems to be one of the more recent ones. His style is nevertheless and unarguably good and musical. I have only heard Horowitz and another one particular pianist by the name of Cecile Licad, who made a quite similar recording of Carnaval Op.9 along with the Toccata in C major and Papillons (SONY label 1990 previously CBS Records Inc.) which in the early nineties was compared with Horowitz, an achievement of its own. Her style is undoubtedly more musical, sadly forgotten and buried in the vast bowels of musical literature and over the years have been posted in different websites (particularly her performamnce of the Toccata in C) but not properly given credit. I urge (even challenge) readers and afficionados to listen to her recording and compare it to this one."
5,Too hot to pass up!!!,"Don't get me wrong if I say you don't need to know the songs on Keith's CD to enjoy his performances. I saw Keith in concert before I bought the CD and enjoyed his show greatly!!! So much so I went out and bought this CD. Let me just say it rocked my world. His voice, character, sense of humor is amazing and it all comes through in his music. Definatly worth the $$, it's worth it to buy one for everyone you know. Giving them this CD will make them instant fans. Just try to prove me wrong. Seeing him perform was great, but having this CD to hear him whenever I want is the next best thing. I also want to let everyone know ""Jeans On"" is the best song off the album, and every other song on it is second best."
5,The BEST CD!,"Keith really knows how to make the greatest music! Hits like Somebody Like You, Song for Dad, and Raining on Sunday make this cd a must for any country music fan! Definately one of my favorites!"
5,Golden Road is Worth More Than Gold,"The sophmore album from Aussie Keith Urban is best described with one word. Phenomenal! The range of music is incredible from up beat track ""Somebody Like You"", to heartfelt ""Song for Dad"".Keith's musical ability also shines through with his fast licks on the guitar all the way to playing a cardboard box. For any sceptics buy this album and your doubts will fly out the window."
5,Hooked!!!,"The first time I saw the ""Raining on Sunday"" video...I was HOOKED! I started listening to Keith's music and bought this album. I never knew what I was missing. This album has quickly become my favorite. The mix of vocals and guitar are impressive and magical. CAUTION: If you listen, you may become addicted too!"
5,Keith Urban has done it!,I really liked the first c.d. but this one is definitely his best. Keith really shows his talent on every song. I listen to this all the time and never get tired of it. I would reccomend it to anyone. You will not regret buying it.
4,Comparison,"Golden Road, the second album by Aussie Country artist Keith Urban to hit the U.S. and Canada, is an excellent compilation of musical artistry. As a follow up to his self-titled debut, this is undoubtedly a remarkable CD that consumers would be delighted with. This album tackles a few difficult issues of the artist's life and I believe the message of overcoming one's personal demons is clear. Also the ballads are highly meaningful. A must have for any Country lover.Where Keith's first album was directed toward relationships and the downfalls that can occur, this is a more high spirited release which speaks of promise, dreams and conquering the obstacles life places in front of us.His vocal and instrumental talent shines through in Golden Road like nothing heard before. Overall this is an excellent addition to any music collection.This review submitted by I-Squad Member Havoc."
5,Fantastic follow-up release,Full of upbeat songs that make you want to jump in your ride and take a road trip with the windows down and the volume sky high!
5,Fantastic Followup,"I Must say Keith has greatly improved from his past album. I recently seen him in concert and he played a few of his new songs and I couldn't wait till I could get the CD, now that I have, I am NOT DISAPPOINTED! A Must Have For ALL COUNTRY FANS like myself!"
5,Great CD,This is a great Cd. I listen to it all the time at work. It's got a great selection of songs and I think that one of my favorites has to be the hidden song!
5,LOVE IT!!!,"Honestly, I have listened to this CD so many times I have nearly worn a hole in it. It has the perfect mix of sappy and upbeat songs.....there is not one that I don't sing along to!"
5,Golden Road,"Keith Urban is back with a strong set of songs with GOLDEN ROAD. The album opens with the infectuous first single ""Somebody Like You"", I dare you to not try and sing along to this truly wonderful song, definately a good song to introduce the album with. ""You Look Good In My Shirt"" is a surefire hit, with an excellent guitar riff, it's an incredibly catchy song. ""Raining on Sunday"" is the second single, a wonderful torch song. ""What About Me"" laments what all of us are thinking, just what the title suggests. ""Whenever I Run"" is an excellent ballad, about running to the one you love. There is quite a bit of guitar, banjo and fiddle on this album, filled with his wonderful vocals. Other highlights include ""Song For Dad"", ""You'll Think of Me"" and ""Who Wouldn't Wanna Be Me"". Definately pick up GOLDEN ROAD right away, its an excellent CD!"
5,You Beaut Aussie Goodness!,"I have been calling all my mates up telling them to take a geezer at this true blue release worth it's weight in gold. Keepin' it real Keith Urban has dominated the World Country Music Charts with this near to perfect CD release. To say that all the tracks are excellent is an understatement, what you find here is hit after hit belting out through your speakers for a truly fantastic aural euphoric plunder in bliss experience. Keith is the result of a musical love child between John Mellencamp and Steve Vai, and a little John Taylor bedroom eyes genetics to boot (scoot)."
5,THE BEST YET!!,If you don't already have this cd GET IT!! If you do have it then GET ANOTHER ONE! This is Keith's best work yet. Love it!
5,Golden Road,"Golden Road is Great from begining to end. This is the first CD I bought as a new Country Music fan. Golden Road has something for everyone. The lyrics in Keith's music are inspiring, emotional and upbeat. Golden Road spoke to me in every song in many ways. Because Golden Road was everything I expected and more I was inspired to purchase other music by Keith. If you need inspiration and hope, this is the cd for you. And if you just need good music, then this cd will do that too.You will be HAPPY with the music on Golden Road."
5,GOLDEN ROAD IS GOLDEN,"This album is wonderful from start to finish. There's not a bad track on it and the hidden ""One Chord Song"" at the end makes me smile every time I hear it. It's great to have something new from my favorite Aussie! Go get it today!!"
5,Golden Road - Keith Urban,"I bought this CD after seeing and hearing Keith Urban's ""Somebody Like You"" video featuring beauty Nicky Taylor. Urban does not stray to far away from his firmly planted country roots. His blend of country and rock is the perfect mix. Keith's guitar solos are in a word ""awesome"". Many of the songs seem to come from personal experiences. I especially like, ""You Won"" and ""Who Wouldn't Wanna Be Me"". The suprise guitar solo at the end of ""Somebody Like You"" is ear candy. Keep up the great work Keith!"
5,What a superb artist. He doesn't sound like he talks!,"As an Aussie he certainly sounds country. Well thought out POSITIVE lyrics and connected, well produced vibes. He certainly deserves the acclaim that has followed him. Maybe more. Doesn't hurt to have a famous connection though.."
5,Really Good,"This album is one of his first big ones, and it is an awesome album! I listen to it as often as I can!"
5,Aussome Keith Does It Again,"keith urban is amazing and extraordinary. His guitar prowess is amazing. Since we purchased Golden Road on release date it has been the only CD in the car. I love tracks 1,2,6,7,10,11 and the Hidden track. Track 10 is ""Song For Dad"" it is touching telling of the relationship that keith and his father have. Tracks 6 & 7 ""Jeans On"" and ""You Look Good In My Shirt"" are funny and clever and the riffs are Aussome!"
4,"Urban's Album, Truely Golden","This Cd is great. It has spent most of it's time in my cd player, virses my cd holder. It rocks. It's Keith Urban's best album yet. It's a must for any music lover."
5,Totally refreshing,This is an awesome CD. It has a little of everything. Every song is bound to touch all of us. They are all about every day life and experience. Experiences that we have all been through and can relate to. The guitar pickin' by keith is just amazing. A must have in your CD collection
3,Sweet Sounds,Keith Urban has a smooth flowing voice; the beat of his songs is always postive and uplifting. You will feel terrific listening to this CD. It is full of love and hope and joy. I was lifting to the clouds by his music.
5,Keith Urban Shines on Golden Road,"Keith Urban has been around the country music business for quite a while, but Golden Road will be the album that will get him noticed. The first single, a upbeat tune called ""Somebody Like You"" soared to the #1 spot on the charts and stayed there for eight weeks, making it the biggest hit of Keith's career. His current single ""Raining On Sunday"" is poised to follow in it's footsteps.Keith is an incredible guitar player and this album includes some amazing guitar work. Not only is Keith a great guitarist and singer, but he can also write. He cowrote or wrote eight of the twelve tunes on Golden Road, including the song he wrote for his father ""Song For Dad"".This CD is another great album from a singer headed for the top. It would make a great addition to your music collection."
2,Not a fan,I heard him on xm and I really loved one of his songs and then I listened to the album. That was the only decent song on there and then I realized he was from australia. Not what I was used to I guess. I tried listening to it a few times but it never caught me.
5,Touching and very Personal CD!,"I have been a fan of Keith Urban from the beginning and have loved his music but this album is his best by far...it is a very personal look at Keith as a person.It shows his talent for writing as well as singing. And it proves once again what a strong musician he is also.If you never buy another album of his, you should invest in this one..Try it, you'll like it!MNKUGirl(I-Squad Member)"
5,A Wonderful Surprise,"I bought this CD for one song...""Who wouldn't want to be me"". I heard the song at a wedding reception while my little cousin was singing along. However, the whole CD is wonderful. I look forward to any future Keith Urban music."
5,You'll Think Of Me...Raining On Sunday,There are two terrific songs on this CD that I could listen to again and again. Raining on Sunday is a great relationship song about just taking time to be with the one you love instead of letting the real world catch you up and take you away from the most important person in your life. And You'll Think of Me is just a great song about how you still find yourself thinking of people even when they are long gone from your life. Anyway...this entire album is great and worth buying or downloading. Those just happen to be two of the best country (rock-ish) songs with great guitar sections. You won't be disappointed.
5,Absolutely One of the Best,"Keith Urban's CD, Golden Road, is defenately one of the best country CD's of all time. I wasn't a big fan of Keith until I heard ""Someone Like You"" on the radio. I went out to a music store just getting some CD's that I wanted with a gift certificate, and I had some money left and I didn't know what else to buy, so I picked up Keith's CD just to give it a chance. IT WAS WORTH IT! This CD has some of the best country music I have ever heard and it is by far my favorite country CD in my collection. I don't have just one favorite song on the whole CD because every song is a great one. There isn't a song on this CD that you will want to skip over. It is defenately worth your money!"
5,A Keith Urban Review:,"I think this is the best Cd because i love every song on it and that don,t happen much.but i love all the songs on this Cd and all the others as well.keith is the greatest artists to ever hit nashville in a very long time, and i think he deserve ever thing that he has gotten so far and a lot more.i know he will be around for a long time to come and i will be his fan till the day i die.keep up the great work keith i love you.Carmen PayneHanceville,ALA"
5,Golden Road is golden,"I can't say enough about this amazing CD. It makes you feel happy, sad, reborn, energetic, etc...it puts you in an overall good mood! This by far Keith's best work. He's a multi talented artist that is finally getting the recognition he deserves. He reveals himself like no other artist I know can. This is a must for anyone's CD collection."
1,>>>>>+++++ CAUTION +++++>>>>>,"I too purchased this charger and found the power connector loose on the circuit board. After soldering that back on it still doesn't charge the battery, but now I'm suspicious of the battery itself. Another 'feature' I wasn't fond of is this charger fits 2 battery types (Canon & Sony) and it's not exactly clear how the battery should be positioned in the charger. I'm thinking, put it in backwards, and your battery could be toast."
2,Didn't work so well for me...,I bought this to charge my canon 5L battery. After a year (and not so many charges) it wouldn't fully charge my camera battery unless I put a rubber band around the power connector to the charging body. Kinda lame and cheesy. I bought a replacement from local electronics store. Different brand. Hopefully it'll last longer and be better quality.
3,Abbott and Costello meet the Andrew Sisters.,"Fun, World War II period piece. A & C in one of their best but the Andrew Sisters and the great swing music are what really set this apart. Just to hear and see ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"" and ""Apple Blosson Time"" is enough to recommend this movie. And don't miss the killer jitter-bug scene toward the end of the movie. It rocks! (Any of the so-called swing kids out there, worthy of their high-rise drapes, should already have this movie in their collection.) Also, don't miss Shemp Howard, sans Moe and Larry, as the mess cook."
1,Not so funny,This guys maybe were funny in 1950 but today... Tons of cliches of old times comedy and nothing original. Better buy Stan and Laurel!
5,The Best Drawers Ever!,These are the most comfortable drawers I have ever worn. I can barely tell I have them on.
3,"Good, but not great, book by the former Chief of the Service","As the leading civilian authority on the U.S. Secret Service, I was moderately impressed with Frank J. Wilson's book, co-written with Beth Day, entitled ""Special Agent."" Don't get me wrong: it's a fine book...but some of the facts are wrong, there's no index, it's alittle dated, and alittle dry in places. Still, for the Secret Service researcher, it's essential."
4,A glimpse of the past,"As another reviewer stated, this is not a polished professional recording. Rather, it is a documentary of a tradition that is rapidly being lost in its homeland. These are real people, and at times they are hard to listen to. However, for lack of a better phrase, it grows on you, especially if you have Calabrese ancestry. Many of the melodies & singing styles reminded me very much of the ""Mystery of the Bulgarian Voices"", as there is definitely the same exotic quality."
2,"Manfred is good, BUT....","If there was a way to unsync the two sides of your brain so that you can put a delay between what you see and what you hear, then this would be a great DVD. How in the world could this DVD be released when the audio is sooooo out of whack?The last reviewer is right on when he says that there is a 1 second difference between watching a snare drum being hit and hearing it a second later. While watching this terrible sync, you try to put it back to normal with your brain, but it doesn't work. As much as this concert LOOKS good..and SOUNDS good..these two qualities TOGETHER add up to one broken DVD."
2,Must be read with a shovel.,"I'm no slouch, but this book is really tough to get through. The author makes a difficult subject even more so with his overly erudite writing style, long sentences, and obscure references. A good editor might have helped a lot."
4,The Very Best of Latin Jazz,"A great selection of tracks, but spoilt somewhat in that the tracks seem to run into eachother and volume of each track varies. However, worth buying for the music alone."
1,wish you were here pink floyd,WHEN I ORDERED THIS DVD I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IS WAS THE CONCERT OF WISH YOU WERE HERE.IT WAS NOT .I WATCH IT AND IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.THAT IS MY LAST DVD I WILL BUY .
3,Pink Floyd,I purchased this as a gift and glad that you have such a diverse selection of items. I will be eagar to hear how this is from my friend.
3,"Ok, but not up to expectations","I was expecting this doc to be as good as the Classic Albums: Dark Side of the Moon doc (available for streaming on Netflix).This is definitely more amateurish and not as engaging as the the earlier documentary. There is a bunch of good info for die-hards but the presentation is not great.It does make me want to see an entire documentary on Syd, though...."
1,cheap and tawdry,"Another cheap attempt to perpetuate the myth and mystery of Syd Barret, all for the sake of the mighty dollar. Nothing but a series of mildly revealing interviews going over the same stuff."
4,Wish you were here,"Too much talking and not enough music, it gave the story of each band member that was informative, but far too long"
2,I paid 20 bucks for this?,"Just as I was getting into this, it was over. Only an hour? Whaaa? Hardly any footage of the band, and way to short...Not to mention the timeline is completely scattered. I love Pink Floyd, and it does offer some great insight on the album..but I was disappointed."
1,Ask me about Alaskan,"The most fun I had with this game was the excitement I had waiting to play it. You start out walking from the lodge, you see a musk ox, you are finally able to get off a shot and the game is over because you fired your gun within fifty feet of the lodge. You try again and walk farther this time when you hear a snarling, growling noise and realize you are being attacked by something because your energy bar is going down. The display says, ""You have been killed by a bobcat."" I tried this game for over an hour and thats all the farther I got. Oh, once when I was being attacked by something, I started firing blindly and I heard the wolf yelp...never did see it, mind you...and was fined again for shooting too close to the lodge. During the tutorial I once shot a bear and the graphics were awful. Don't waste your money."
3,Chasing the Devil's Tail,"This is the first of David Fulmer's books I have read. I probably should have started with Rampart Street, but will read it eventually. I liked Chasing the Devil's Tail a lot, and particularly liked the protagonist Valentin St. Cyr and hope to read other books about him. Interesting how he changed his name from Valentino Saracena. The descriptions of Storyville were great, although the names of the madames of all the Houses became somewhat confusing. But all in all I liked it, and look forward to reading Jass also by David Fulmer."
1,"Dear David Fulmer,","Alas, David, you have done us wrong!! Imagine penning an entire book based on New Orleans and a ""Creole"" detective, yet apparently not knowing the meaning of the term. Why do you refer to St. Cyr as a Creole of 'mixed race'? That is NOT the meaning of the term Creole!! A creole is a person born in the West Indies or Latin America, who is really of European ancestry, particularly Spanish. It may also mean a person of mixed Spanish and French ancestry. Anyone familiar with New Orleans, or Louisiana in general, knows a person of mixed race is NOT referred to as Creole. Give us a break. Makes me prefer to read something by Ace Atkins instead."
2,Not among Crawford's best,"This novel is an Arabian fantasy about a genie who must win the love of the loveless Zehowah, a Sultan's daughter. He tries this, that, and the other to get her to love him, to no avail. Only at the end when he's ready to sacrifice his life to a waiting mob does she crack. True, it's a fantasy, but Zehowah's absolute refusal to have any feelings for Khaled is hard to take. This was Crawford's favorite of all his books--which is also hard to take: he wrote much better ones than this."
5,Excellent movie to watch over and over,The first time we watched this movie was probably over 10 years ago - loved it then and love it now. The music is fabulous as is the story line and acting. It's a great one to own!!!
3,"Fair, not great","It's perhaps me, but I couldn't get past the fact that just about every major character was based upon a real life player in the Brill Building/60s pop music era. And I could not reconcile Carole King ending up with Brian Wilson, or Phil Spector trying to dance. Had the characters been truly original we may have had a great story here. The music is certainly strong enough. God Give Me Strength is about as stirring a song as has ever been written for a movie. I'd rather give the movie 2 1/2 stars, but I'm forced to round up."
5,Great DVD for a great movie!,"I first saw this on encore or something a few years ago and loved it!Being a huge fan of the Brill building pop of the late 50s to the early 70s and an admirer of director Allison Anders I was all over this.I was quite happy with it!Great performances,music,and story arc.The dvd has a widescreen film with great sound,deleted scenes(w/3 music performances),a making-of featurette with cast and crew,and commentary from Anders.Yay Universal!"
5,A wonderful undiscovered gem of a movie,"This movie is beautiful and touching and amazing. The only part that bothers me is that more people don't know about it. I tell everyone I know to watch this movie. Illeana Douglas is one of my favorite actresses and the cast is first rate. Matt Dillon , Eric Stoltz, Bridget Fonda....the list goes on. The music while not superb, was a great comical send-up to the genres of the time and some of the songs were actually quite good. I highly recommend watching this movie."
4,"Good cast, good story","I picked this movie up on a whim, and I really enjoyed the story about the rise and fall of the Brill Building songwriters. I especially enjoyed the chemistry between Douglas and Matt Dillon, and the stellar performance by John Turturro. He is on my list of overrated actors. The only thing I didn't like was the editing. At times, it could be very choppy and you could tell which scenes were being cut."
5,Wide TV Credenza,"This credenza is a large and heavy piece of furniture. It works great for our 82 inch TV. It takes awhile to put together, but worth the effort. It is a rich dark brown and very expensive looking. We love it!!!!!!!!"
1,Poor Durability,"I purchased 6 units approximately 2 1/2 years before writing this review. In the time that has passed, 4 units have failed for varied deficiencies including, but not limited to 1) failed head gaskets, b) a failed relief gasket, and c) a failed bypass valve. During a longer span of time, there have been zero failures of installed Champion branded valves. I conclude that the Orbit product is a failure waiting to happen. Given the time an expense of installing sprinkler valves, I strongly recommend that interested purchasers buy the genuine article -- the Champion anti-siphon value with automatic manifold."
1,1 out of 4 failure,"I'm a beginner (now novice) at all this. Hours of internet research, several books. Bought four to match existing units. One has failed after only a 1/2 year. Thought it was the solenoid and bought one. Finally just bought a new value. All this was a very expensive learning lesson. After looking at the Amazon reviews, will try RainBird from here on out.December 28, 2009Two more have failed. The Home Depot clerk said it shouldn't, because it's the top of the line. Really disappointed with the product. Have given it two stars prior, will drop it drop it down to one."
1,same experience,I bought 6 orbit brass valves less than a year ago. 3 have stopped functioning. I was looking for the solenoid but I think I will go buy another brand of brass valve after reading these reviews
3,Good but not great.,"I liked this book. But I honestly was expecting more about what it was like playing for Coach Meyer. The author does a good job pointing out certain things that Coach Meyer stood for. For example, Coach Meyer believed in making players take notes. What I would have liked to see from the author was- what notes did you take? I think this would have given insight into Coach Meyer and what it was like to play for him. Overall, I give this book 3 of 5 stars because it is, in my opinion, almost too general and not specific enough (at times, very repetitive in ""reporting"" what happened in the games). I enjoyed it, though, and would loosely recommend it."
4,A good player perspective....worth reading,"I have long been interested in Don Meyer's approach to coaching basketball, and was very excited to be able to read a book from one of his own former players. I own many of his tapes, which are excellent, and a few of his notebooks that detail what it is like to be involved in a whole season under Don Meyer.This book was enjoyable, and anyone who aspires to be a coach or just enjoys reading about coaching and sports I would recommend picking it up. The overall writing of the book is very average, and doesn't give you a great impression of Don Meyer's attitude and overall approach to the game, but you do get good perspective of how he coaches.This is a book that I plan on picking up again a few years from now and reading again."
2,Stating the Obvious,"I felt that this book misses the mark. Most of the information is online, and the book does give many details about each occupation. At points it gets way too technical to be useful. It seems to have two audiences- high schoolers interested in math, and math majors applying for a job. The first group wouldn't be interested in the more technical aspects (resume-writing, for instance), and the second group will find this book to be too basic for their needs (they already know which occupation they want, hence them writing their resume for it)."
1,Dissatisfied!!,"The book is not at all what I hoped for or expected. I was not looking for technical design advise or insights. I am seeking something more holistic and creative that will help me become more visual in my creativity, a book that will help me access my visual side through my emotions, thoughts, senses while giving me ideas and suggestions on how I can do so in my everyday life and creative career as a dancer, writer and sensual movement artiste. I'd like to return the book. Shortly after receiving it, I had an accident and messed up my foot. Your email for feedback is a reminder that I need to return the book to the shipper.Please give me guidance on the procedure.This book is geared for the visual technical designer such as a graphic artist, an interior designer and decorator, etc.Thank you!"
1,"Eye Candy, Brain Vacuum","OK, you can certainly see lots of examples of cool designs, but if you are looking for actual HELP with learning to design, this is NOT the book for you. I kept waiting for the book to be useful. Finally, towards the end is a section of exercises that can help ""unlock"" your visual creativity. That was useful, but in the end, it didn't redeem the book.If you are looking for a neat beginner's guide to design principles, see ""The Non-Designer's Design Book,"" another gem by Robin Williams."
5,a sense in life or an essence of life,"If you are looking for the sense in your life, want to look at what are you doing in this world - read this book. It is an easy reading with that makes a great sense when you are prepared to accept it.Till now (Dec 03) the author has published 7 books in this series, this one is the first translation I know about.PS I've read the book in Russian, hope the translation is good."
3,Bumpin Bumpin,"I like this song. Is this a new group? lol jk. T & C really outdid theirselves but I wish the tracklisting had an instrumental & 1-2 remixes. Nice, tho."
3,Pretty and fun for a little while.........,"I love this doll head, because the hair is great, the doll is pretty and it's durable. I purchased it for my almost 5 year old daughter. She really enjoyed putting the stickers all over the doll. She didn't understand how to use the fingernails and that definitely requires adult assistance. She also loved that all the jewelry/hair pieces can be taken off and she can wear them herself. But once the stickers are gone... there isn't any makeup or additional products to use on the doll. So she used it for about a month and now it sits there. Very pretty on the shelf, but not a long play-life."
1,Not what I wanted,"I didn't realize that it was a 230 V, until it reach here, and then when I did find use for a 230 V backup, one of the two I bought failed to work. Not too happy with this purchase."
4,A Great Ride,This DVD is a must for train fans. It covers some of the best scenic railroads in the USA. (The Cass Scenic Railroad is a personal favorite--a great trip through West Virginia's mountains in spactacular fall color.)
5,Timeless window into man's soul,"This is the Jorma album that stands the test of time best for me. His playing is spontaneous and driven by feeling rather than technique as it usually is. Songwriting is divinely inspired. It is not unusual for artists to create masterpieces during turbulent times in their lives...perhaps because we are closest to God in weakness, and the best songwriting involves powers more mysterious and elusive than logic, education, and technique. Unfortunately my copy was lost during a turbulent period in my own life! It is worth the money to replace it."
4,Casio Men's G-shock,"Very nice watch, but I didn't realize that it was a little small for my son, being that he is 6'3"" and weighs about 250lbs. but he likes it. And he wore it today."
4,So far so good,"Sober looks with decent features. Keeps good time. Only concern is that configuring the watch like setting of time, changing time zone etc is a bit cryptic and requires the user guide. This could have been made a bit simpler."
2,Great show - weak DVD's ...,WB really give the impression that they are totally uninterested in doing anything even remotely special with their valuable Batman properties on DVD.They know there is a market out there for season boxed-sets of this show (due to repeated requests made to them from the public) - why would they choose to ignore this?My advice would be to vote with your wallet and wait until WB wake up to themselves and treat this award-winning television show with the respect it fully deserves.
1,There are no more heroes...,"Thats right, you heard me...there are no more heroes..not on DVD at any rate.I too, must agree that this is an extremely shoddy treatment of a spectacular animated series. My friend bought it and I borrowed it to see if it was worth having at all. It isn't. It hurts to think that Warner Bros. doesn't think highly enough of its fans to treat such a gem of a show with such half hearted effort. I wont go into the details, the other reviews are more than adequate in outling the complete absence of any redeeming value of this disc.I fully support my disappointed comrades and will say that Fox will continue to get the bulk of my money on DVDs until Warner Bros. can come up with a box set release thats worthy of the Batman series."
1,"Great Series, Terrible Treatment","5 episodes a year, with no special features? That's how WB is choosing to release this GEM of an animated series. Unbelievable. Instead of putting out a box set per season, with a comprehensive episode guide and some special features, they are releasing this disappointing DVD. It's great to finally have them on a disc, but not 5 at a time."
2,Mediocre,"I purchased this product with very high hopes of being able to style my short hair! However, for every day styling, this flat iron doesn't work very well for me! The curved plates serve a purpose, but not for just a regular pass through and simple style! It heats up well and super fast! However, clamped together, the plates are very chunky!! Overall, this flat iron is ok! But I don't get much use out of it!!"
3,Nothing special at this price,"PROS:-It is colorful-It squeaks, so is possibly more interesting than stuffed toys that do nothingCONS:-Poor construction, I was so shocked when I saw threads coming out of it, and those felt 'hairs' falling off...right out of the box-Doesn't 'do' anything for this price, unlike gloworm, which costs less - lights up and singsBEST USE: Maybe 6 mo age rangeRECOMMENDATION: Not worth the money.It doesn't really do anything and isn't made very well. My son LOVES tags, so we thought this would be ideal - that he would play with the large felt 'hairs,' but he never liked this toy and has ignored it since day one. He prefers Lullaby Gloworm, a simple small blue dog made by Carter, and a small stuffed Tiger."
2,Cute Hedgehog but not as described on the box,"The hedgehog arrived from Amazon and it is adorable....soft and colorful. Unfortunately,the nose does not squeak at all nor are the ears crinkly (two things that are described in words and pictures on the box).....I'm guessing that something (or someone) on the assembly line malfunctioned and neglected to include the features (squeaker and crinkly-sound fabric) that would make these item more than a cute (and quiet) stuffed animal."
3,A GREAT ATTEMPT TO CREATE ELECTRO-NEGROIDE..,"I give Novalima credit for trying to emulate the electrotango movement of Argentina with traditional Afro-Peruvian songs. However, I think that the CD would have been better if it would have included more cajon rhythyms and more musicalization along with the lounge sound... But it's a very soothing CD. If you listen to it, it'll very enjoyable... This CD is not your traditional Afro-Peruvian music CD, but is very creative and it'll certainly lead the way for the development of a new wave of Electro-Negroide."
2,Requires the patience of a saint..,"..and the vision of a someone who's misplaced their bifocals. Unless the color of the item requiring repair EXACTLY matches the premixed colors, you're gonna be mixing colors til the cows come home to come up with the right shade. Aside from the color, it looked like a patch job as the texture didn't match. Also, application wore off quickly and item reverted back to the condition it was before I struggled with this. Save yourself the aggravation. Put the money toward a replacement or a throw to cover the tear/hole."
4,Surprisingly good results,"I'm quite happy with the repair I got from this kit. I had a big tear (1/2"" x 3"") in my vinyl car seat. This kit had everything I needed and the repair came out pretty good: you can tell it's patched, but I'd say it's 80% or so. Looks better than the piece of electrical tape I had on there before. For the price it can't be beat.One advantage of my situation was that my seats were black so I did not need to do any color mixing. I could see how it would be difficult to get a good color match on a non-standard color."
3,"Good Product, Not For Every Application","I think this is probably a good product, just not for the application for which I needed it. My pickup seat has a tear in the material where it hits the hard plastic of the seat bracket, it tore because each time the seat cushion is compressed the material would rub on the plastic. The repair kit does not provide a durable enough fix for this situation."
2,Not good for convertible tops.,"It doesn't work for repairing convertible tops. It did last for a few months on the tears in my soft top, but they split again."
4,vinyl repair,It did A pretty good job. The flat iron needs to be on the repair longer than recomended to get the vinyl repair material to completely dry. I repaired two corvette door panels and then repainted with sem vinyl paint. They both look like new.
2,Don't use unless you are a color-mixing expert!,"I had some tears in the back seat of my MINI when i bought it used, and thought I could easily patch them up with this kit. The seat color is charcoal gray and I had a devil of a time trying to mix the black and white to try to get the exact color. the paint is also very gooey and difficult to apply evenly. If you do have a tear in your vehicle seating , I would strongly suggest getting a professional to do the job properly."
1,Good luck trying to color match,"Bought this for a small hole in the vinyl in my boat seat. My boat vinyl is neither white nor cream, its an off-white type color (technically its called 'bone') and trying to color match was impossible. I never ended up using the product because I couldn't color match correctly. If you have perfect white or other base colors then you'll have an easier time with this product."
1,I would give it ZERO stars if I could.,"I followed the directions for this EXACTLY, used on a couple of small cracks (not holes) on a vinyl arm rest on a chair. I used the black, and did not have to mix any colors. This should have been simple. First off - a warning... the heating element smokes because the hot metal parts come in direct contact with the cheap plastic handle. If you use it too long, it really gives off smoke with a bad chemical smell. It is definitely not a well-made piece of equipment - borderline fire hazard if you don't use it properly. After using the kit, the CRACK that was in the armchair hardened and split further, making the repair look WORSE than the original crack. I should have just left it alone and done nothing. I can not recommend this product. DO NOT USE!!!"
1,Urgent! Pay attention to the reviews!,"I gave this 1 star, but only because that is the lowest rating. Ladies and gentlemen, unless you have red, white, or black upholstery to match, this has no hope of working. The instructions tell you to make a small amount of the paste and match it to the leather or vinyl. Problem is, you start with their color chart, and the instructions as I followed them did not even come close to the chart, much less my car seat. No amount of adding base color (white) could fix it, and then, I ran out of white. That was it.Take my advice. Follow the recommendations of people here. They have made the mistake of buying this product and then reporting on it so that you would not make the same mistake. It seemed to me that there was just no other product to do this job. That means one thing: There is no product to fix this. Call an upholstery store."
4,Excellent writing!,"Although a fan of Rick's public television show, I wasn't sure what to expect from this book since it's a bit of a break from his regular guidebooks. I was very pleasantly surprised! Rick has a dry and sophisticated sense of humor that I found quite amusing. His descriptions about the various characters he has met in his travels are really entertaining."
1,For Die Hard Fans ONLY,"As a travel guide writer, Rick offers folksie homespun advice for novice travellers,which is fine, but as a humourist he fails miserably. This is like reading someones random thoughts on their favourite places, past experiences and family life. He is all over the place, literally, straining to make the mundane amusing. For die hard Steve's fans only!"
3,Entertaining,"Although a touch maudlin at times, this is an entertaining travelogue that gives the reader far more insight into Rick Steves than do his travel guidebooks. It's heartening to know that even ""the guru"" has doubts, fears and misgivings when he travels in Europe."
4,postcards are for everyone,Rick Steves postcards from Europe is a great way to relive places in Europe that you have been and a nice way to preview places that you might want to visit in the future.He introduces you to people from many different places and you almost feel as though you know them.
3,"(singing) ""The Hills Are Alive With Rick Steve's Musings...""","We enjoy independent European Travel and leap across the ocean as frequently as we can. Rick's books are helpful although he is remains opinionated and upfront, we enjoy that. This book is a wandering account of his quarter century of travel to the ""old country"" which he continually makes fresh and alive. But, for historical information and details, we tote along a ""Blue Guide.""Perhaps the best service he encourages is this---travel is not just experiencing the past, but making international friends along the way"
2,Entertaining reading but no really helpful for traveling hints.,I found his antedotes entertaining but they weren't very helpful in providing traveling tips for a recent trip to Europe.
4,Very Enjoyable Read,"I am a big fan of Rick Steves guidebooks. I use them every time I travel around Europe. I am really happy to say that I enjoyed this book as well. It is neat hearing more information on some of the same people and places he lists in the guidebooks. Also, I really learned how Steve came to love travelling to Europe and a bit about how he started the business.He definitely has a dream job as some others have said in their reviews. Definitely would recommend this book to Rick Steves fans!"
3,THIS BOOK IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THEIR WAY EUROPE OR THERE,"THIS BOOK IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THEIR WAY EUROPE OR THERE OR JUST GOT BACK FROM EUROPE, NOT FOR PEOPLE YOU ARE JUST WISHING TO GO THERE OR ARM CHAIRS READERSThis book was too simply boring. I hope he does this project, plus with his family included and tons of big pictures with this too. Thank you."
5,"Personally, I think it's a crime that this is out of print","The three trumpeting Läubin brothers (all of whom play for German orchestras) team up with Simon Preston for a program of excerpts taken from all manner of baroque pieces. The result is a thoroughly enjoyable bit of listening, beautifully played, beautifully recorded. The final track, a rousing version of Handel's ""See, the conq'ring hero comes"", is worth the price alone."
4,Bump in the road for TL,"This cd is not nearly as good as TL's previous releases. The songs are just not as tight and memorable on this outing. His trademark inventiveness, soaring vocals, thoughtful lyrics, and powerful instrumentation are all present, but it all feels sort of pasted-together within each song. Each song has its moments, highlights in time where you feel the emotion, but they seem to be just that: moments-- the complete songs never really form a coherent and memorable whole. I also question the ordering of the songs- the album feels uneven and lurches from style to style in a way that doesn't flow at all.The four stars are for the fact that this is still great music...but it just feels a bit more like generic indie rock, rather than the stunning and heartfelt music I've come to expect from Ted.If you are just starting out listening to Ted Leo, I would steer you to Tyranny of Distance or Shake the Sheets, which are towering masterpieces of rock and roll."
5,Another great album,"A much less ""poppier"" album than his last but shows a wider variety of his playing style. A few reggae influenced songs and longer drawn out songs (ala Little Dawn live extended songs) with a sort of epic feel to some of them. However, unlike the last album, this one doesn't provide anything that will hit big commercially except for ""Sons of Cain"" but still another quality album that is another step in Ted Leo's musical development."
4,something's lacking,"As a huge fan of Shake the Sheets' power and catchy-ness, something is definitely missing here. The lyrics are superb but the delivery feels flat and monotonous.Compared to most of the rubbish that's out there, it's really good yet several steps from great."
4,RAGGA RAGGA RAGGA 2003,"THIS IS A CD THAT ALL REGGAE "" DANCE HALL"" FANS SHOULD INVEST IN THIS IS FULL WITH HIT FROM START TO FINSH. WITH SOME OF THE BIGGEST NAME IN THE BUSSINESS, I CAN SAY MONEY WELL SPENT."
3,A good book,"Everyone,This is a good book. However, I expected a little more from it. When I bought this book I was expecting to see a real look at prison society and life. It was a little too politically correct for me. I was expecting a gritty California prison novel, but I was greeted with a look at prison from the eyes of what seemed to be a middle class author and not a convict. It just didn't seem all that real. It seemed like I could have thought up the ideas myself. But, it was a really great read and I will buy more Edward Bunker books. His writing is addictive(I finished the book in less than 2 days), and I really want to read another to see how different or similar it will be. I would recomed this book for anyone who enjoys crime novels or prison novels, but I will read another one of Bunker's books before I tell people that he is worth reading more than once."
1,This book is confusing,This book offers good examples but the questions are confusing and badly worded it lacks lots of explination on the nature of the program to be written
3,Mozart shouldn't be this clipped and brisk,"After praising a number of Levine's Mozart recordings, especially his wonderful Posthorn Serenade, this CD brought me up short. Levine is always quick in this music, verging on the efficient. Here he is downright brusque, forcing tempos and clipping phrases everywhere. Not a single bar, even in the slow movements, is allowed to relax or smile. The Vienna Phil. plays with its expected finesse, even at these breakneck speeds, but the digital sound from 1986 is thin and glassy. I will tiptoe a bit more cautiously through Levine's complete Mozart cycle from now on."
5,Fits my phone but not my car,"The product is probably a decent product, but it doesn't work in my vehicle, '04 Jetta. I think it has to do with the part you plug into the cigarrette lighter being to long."
1,not for true fans,the service from the vendor was great but the cd was very disapointing. the performance was really bad. the vocals were off.
3,Good but,The screwdriver set is good......but I have already broken 2 of the slots/heads to it. The metal used is really cheap.
5,EXCELLENT,This has been the best book I have read in a long time. I thought her Historical Romance books were the bomb but this book was awesome. I was a little skeptical at first having being use to her other books but I was not dissapointed. Buy this book you won't be sorry.
5,Historicals or Contemporary??,"Beverly Jenkins has proven she can go ""both ways"". This book, with descendents (Graysons/Vashons)from her historicals is a great read and the characters are so strong, independent, and still working to help The Race regardless to the era. Mykal Chandler could be broke and still be awesome; Sarita, as with all of Ms Jenkins' women is a sista that makes one proud to be a woman. Dragons and Little Red Riding Hood will now have a different meaning for me. I hope Saint will have a story in the future. This book was worth the wait, Ms Jenkins. However, I hope we don't have to wait too long for another. Keep up the good work, Lady."
4,Edge of Midnight,Interesting story line.Read book non-stop. Enjoyed new Characters being introduced at Intervals. The three brothers are interesting and each ones is so different.A good Read!!
4,So Good!!!,"What an amazing storyteller!!! I've read all but 3 of her historical romances, and was somewhat hesistant to read her contemporary novels - that is, until I read Rhythms of Love - and loved it!. How could I doubt this woman's skills?This was a really good story; sexy, suspenseful and funny. Mykal was yet another sexy hero, and Ms. Sarita was as tough and strong-willed as her 'many greats-grandmother'. I really like that she tied these new characters to the characters in her historical novels. Absolutely great cast of characters. Can't wait to read St. and Drake's stories.Another good book that I think you'll love! Keep 'em coming!"
5,Speechless,"I will keep it short since my title is ""Speechless"". Best book I've read in years. Thank you Ms Jenkins."
5,One of Beverly's best!,"This one was exceptional, I especially like the tie in to characters from previous Beverly Jenkins books. Characters are great and sensual. I highly recommend this book!"
2,not completley accurate,"I am Swedish and bought this book as a present for a friend.The book is cute, but after I read a story about manhole covers in my country that I, nor any of my Swedish friends ever heard of, I'm getting suspicious that there may be stories in other countries that aren't true."
3,Interesting but sparse,"This is an interesting book to read. It gives you insight into various cultures. But it's not a good investment if you're going to a single country listed in the book and want to use this as a serious aid. Each country is given 2-3 pages of information covering handshakes, what to wear, gifts, etc. It's good to know, but it's a fairly shallow treatment; I'd prefer many pages of regular print rather than the glossy presentation here. Still, it makes for a quick, fun read if you're into this sort of thing."
2,Not that impressed,"Based on the price and the amazing reviews I expected these to be a great buy, but was sorely disapointed. They are just like normal sheets I have purchased at Target...not soft...not before, not after I washed them. Definitely regretting this purchase. : ("
2,500TC sheets,"Sheets became rough after the first washing. I was very disappointed with them, and I bought two sets. Never again."
3,"Nice Sheets, but Not Luxurious!",I was a little disappointed with these. They are nice sheets but I don't feel that they were a great bargain. I've washed a couple of times and they are nice enough to sleep on but not the super-softness I was looking for.
3,Sheets are a good value,"These sheets are not luxurious, rather they are an upgrade from the average sheets you are probably sleeping in now. With a few launderings and some wear they are very comfortable sheets."
2,very dissappointed,Both the fitted sheet and the pillow case are way too big. I don't think they are of standard size. They are very easy to get wrinkled. I began to wonder why so many people gave it positive reviews...
4,Speedo goggles,"Speedo Vanquishers are the only goggles my high school boys will wear for competition because of their fit, performance, and appearance."
3,Great at first. But now extremely foggy.,I followed the directions for taking care of them. They worked great for the first few weeks. No fog whatsoever. But now they fog up almost instantly and I'm constantly washing the fog out. It's annoying. I wish they still worked as well as they did when I first bought them.
4,Nice goggle,"Good shape, good sealing. Yet the fog starts to appear after I used it several times. But I know there's no absolute anti-fog. So overall, it's good product."
1,POOR ANTI-FOG,"The anti-fog worked for 50minutes of my first swim with the on. By the second swim, they were already fogging within the first 10 minutes. I followed the instructions to a tee and rinsed them immediately after practice without letting any chlorine water hit the inside of the lens and STILL FOGGY and RESIDUE on the inside of the lens. Other than the lens looking cool and having a reflective mirror tint, these are terrible goggles!! I would not buy them again or recommend them to anyone."
4,best goggles I've had,"I swim a lot, and these are the best, longest-lasting goggles I've had. I've been using the vanquisher goggles for over a year now. I've had my current pair for almost three months, and they are still pretty fog-free. My only complaint is that the clip on the straps can break easily when adjusting them. I like them a lot better than the hydrospex. The vanquisher plus goggles are especially helpful in blocking the sun when swimming backstroke outside."
2,"Good design, however poor Anti-Fog feature...","After I lost my beloved Speedo swim goggles (can't remember its model) I started looking for a new one. With the impression of those positive reviews, I bought a blue Vanquisher Plus.Well, the antireflective mirrored layer works fine under sunshine and looks cool also. It has 3 separate nosepieces so that you can use the appropriate one to adjust the goggle on your face. However it's very hard to attach/detach them as the connections are too tight.My biggest disappointment is its Anti-Fog feature that vanished after the second use! I wore them at the sea, not in the pool (so no chlorine) and without touching the inner layer I rinsed them with fresh water after each use. However nothing can be seen through the foggy glass now. What a pity... Well, I am not expecting Anti-Fog feature to last forever of course, but come on Speedo, it couldn't survive even a weekend!"
1,The worst swimming goggles I have tried yet!,"First off: they are cheap! You can tell from a second you opned the package they are cheaply made.Comfort wise they are below average, a little stiff and hard. You can really feel them on your face.Anti fog is as bad,well they all kinda lack in this department.Rough rubber strap that is impossible to re- adjust in the pool. I adjusted mine in the room and it took about 10 min and I had to use a tool to do it. Completely unacceptable!I can't find one positive feature to be honest, they are worst than cheap goggles from a dollar store!"
5,Great goggles!,"I am not a professional swimmer, but once I used these goggles I realized that my previous ones were a toy. Great fit, no water leak and do not fog up."
3,It is not really recommended if you have a big nose.,It hurts your nose even though it comes with 4 different sizes of nose bridge.
4,Great goggles but tough to change the nosepieces,I bought two of these for my 9 yr old son. He has a broad bridge so I liked the fact that there were a variety of nosepieces. The nosepieces were tough to switch out. I was afraid that I might break them. Once that was taken care of though he loved them. Once we got the righ nosepiece in and had a good fit then these were a great pair of googles.
2,Good but ...,"I recently bought two pairs of these goggles -- one pair for me, the other for my wife. My pair fit and worked perfectly right out of the package. My wife's leaked from the start. And when we tried to change the nose piece to create a better fit, we were not able to complete the job because of the flawed design. Speedo should have known better."
2,Not worth it,"The rubber gasket on these goggles ripped after on use, and they have fogged up more than any goggles I have used in awhile."
4,Very nice swimming goggles,"These are a set of very nice swimming goggles. Works very good in sunlight as well as when the pool is indoor. The glassy surface tends to get some touch marks which require a soft cloth to clean up but its ok, it does not damage your goggles or obstructs you view while swimming. Comes with 3 nose-hooks which you can choose according to which fits you well."
3,Too Dark for me,"First thing, I am a lap swimmer, not a competitive one, so can't comment on competition quality. But from a point of view of lap swimmer, the biggest problem I found with this product is that they are too dark. Since they are too dark, even slightest of fogging in the goggles creates large amount of fuzziness, after every repeat I need to wash these goggles, which is a little painful, and of course there is no peripheral vision with these goggles. The goggles however are comfortable, so if you don't mind doing laps in dark, foggy and no peripheral viewing condition, you can have them. Otherwise my suggestion would be to go with Hydrospex"
5,Great goggles,"These goggles are exactly what I was looking for. I'm a recreational swimmer and with these goggles, I have perfect visibility, they are comfortable and they stay in place. Couldn't ask for more."
5,Excellent quality and fit,"After using this goggle for a couple of months I liked it so much that I ordered the same model in clear, to use in indoor pools. The goggle is well-built with quality materials, keeps the water out, and it fits comfortably."
3,Not anti fog,cons: 1.The very first day I put them on it fogged up with in minutes. 2.very dark need light to seePros: 1.keeps water out of eyes 2.great UV protectionI wont buy these again.
2,A little stiff,"Confortable but kind of big. Nose bridge is too stiff. Hard to look on sides without turning your head. Antifog, doesn't last very long, a bit expensive for what it is. Blue gives a nice end view of the pool (once in tha water). I think I'll return to my basic swedish googles even though they hurt a little after a few our wearing them."
2,snapped in half on first open water swim.,They fit snuggly and seemed to hold water out pretty well. 15 minutes into my first swim I was hit by a decent wave. Usually waves rip your goggles off your face. These goggles snapped in half at the nose brace / spacer. I've had 10 or more different types of goggles on open water swims and I've never experienced this. The nose brace popped off (and I wear the goggles with medium tension). Goggles were lost (they sink). I usually wear Sable and it takes herculean strength to pop the nose spacers out to replace them. And my aquaspheres don't have spacers. These didn't work as expected. Sigh.
3,"It is nice, but the anti-fog function not work well","Its appearance looks good. However, the anti-fog function does not work well as they describe. I took ""very"" care of it before i use it. But, the first i use it, it start to fog. So, i dump it."
2,anti-fog? maybe not,"this pair of goggles wears really comfortable.BUT, it fogged after my second use!! I am so disappointed so i would just give it two stars."
4,Good set of goggles,I have been very pleased with the quality and durability of these goggles. I have been using them for almost a year and would definitely recommend them.
4,"great cost, but a few downsides","Great low-cost product; this is the same non-drowsy formula as you'll pay an arm and a leg for at the drugstore for a few tablets of Bonine. However, a few notes, largely due to minimal Amazon product info & poor labeling on the actual product:-ASPARTAME: This contains aspartame, which is not clearly stated in the product description. Doesn't bother me, but if you try to avoid aspartame, just be aware.-DOSAGE: The labeling on bottle does NOT state what the dosage is. I am not a doctor and this should not be construed as medical advice, but in my experience taking meclizine HCL in the past, a standard dosage is 1-2 tablets (25-50 mg).-TASTE: Taste is not the greatest. Very chalky, lingers with an odd aftertaste. Other chewable tablets I've had in past are far superior in taste. I'm not complaining since I just paid 7 bucks for 100 tablets, and I can just swallow it like a normal pill instead of chewing."
5,Speed arrival!,"Am very happy with the product, my fiance has virtigo and this helps with it alot. Also quite happy with the speed that it arrived, Thank you very much!"
1,first inactive ingredient is Aspartame,"I am allergic to aspartame plus aspartame has been proven to cause dizziness in studies, and this product is for preventing dizziness and nausea. I will be returning this product and going back to the local drugstore to buy Bonine which has the Meclozine without aspartame."
5,authentic!,"i come from italy and i must say it is very authentic. i love it. it sounds just like home. i do not knoww why anybody does not like it. if you want great italian music, i suggest this. it is very lively and happy. i love this cd. it remind me of home."
1,Rough and tough tunes,"Well, I don't know what I was expecting when I bought this; something along the lines of ""classic Italian tunes,"" I believe. Well, if you're in search of something to listen to while sharing a bowl of pasta with friends, this isn't it! You'd loose your stomach! The singers are not professionals, the sound quality is very good - so you hear every straining note from the ""artists."" This would be a good album for an Italian language teacher, to explore dialectical differences within Italy, but beyond educational pursuits, I wouldn't reccommend this album."
1,not what i expected,"i bought this expecting songs like you'd hear while eating in Olive garden or lively Italian songs, you know, like what everyone thinks of when they think of Italian music, there are about one to three songs on it that sound similar to that kind of music, but the rest are elderly Italians chanting at high pitches that sound dark, strange, and not what you want if you want Italian music. I agree with the other review, maybe for an Italian teacher, but not for me, and if you want lively Italian music, not for you. [the price] is way too much, and I wasted it! errrrggggg! May I suggest the series of world music called Internatiol Passport. They are real folk songs and music from around the world. I've been pleased with each CD i've purchased from them. Just search under La Musica From Italy or Italy Folk Songs From Naples"
4,The Funk is Back!!!,The instrumental is filled with so much funk that it stinks!!! Great little CD at a good price.
3,"Pretty good for the New Prince, but still not like the Old Prince","For $3 bucks, this ain't a bad deal. Pretty good for the New Prince, but not like the Old Prince, SST is an above-average track for Prince that, if added to his recent album, would have been a highlight. Odd Sade reference notwithstanding, this track has a cool New Orleans-style melody hook, complex, gospel-style vocals, and a nice vibe. While the intrumental jam BRAND NEW ORLEANS has a sorta clever title, it's really just another throwaway Prince groove that should have kept in The Vaults. Still, SST ranks as one of Prince's better recent cuts that puts most of his last-decade work to shame. Let's he stays this focused and raw and self-contained on his next full-length effort...but I'm not gonna hold my breath."
1,Buyer Beware,"It was my fault for not asking questions. This small poster, which I thought was one of those lobby sized was not that at all.It was only a really disappointing PICTURE copy of the original. It even has the original's crease marks.It was my fault. But shame on the seller for not being more specific with the description."
4,Good motivational tool,"This book gave me a good look at the process (in short) that many of these individuals had to go through in order to achieve their goals. There were some key similarities among many. One, they did what they loved to do, or what they could do well. Two, they seriously worked HARD at it. Three, there were no short cuts. These three aspects will ring true again and again when you read about successful businesspeople. This book just focuses on those that have done it and are African Americans.I give it a gold star (4 of them)."
4,About time.,"I have been looking for a book like this. It was an excellent choice of subject matter. However, unlike the magazine articles that tell the story of success, these stories lack flavor."
5,Thank You!,"I am delighted to extend a warm, personal ""Thank You"" to Ms. Mitchell for writing such a dynamic book. I commend her and the fine business men and women that appear in her book for the outstanding contributions they make on a daily basis for improving the quality of life for many young black people. It is concerned authors like Niki that help to revitalize the true spirit of black self empowerment. Niki's examples of personal excellence plays an integral role in instilling in young people an appreciation for life, and fostering a climate of ambition and achievement amony young people. This book encourages young and old alike to become business leaders in their communities. I applaud Niki for affording our young people the greatest gift of all for the holidays--FAITH IN THEMSELVES."
5,Awesome surprise!,"I bought this cd for the title track, Resurrection and was not disappointed. Every song on the cd deserves its play time! I love both the Spanish and English songs... definitely worth the money!"
4,A Feast to the Eyes,"This is an exceptionally beautiful book. Donna Green's luminous illustrations shine forth on nearly every page, in correspondence to the glow of the season which the book concerns. I strongly recommend that anyone who appreciates truly fine art should purchase a copy of this volume."
4,A literary genius.,"This historical comedy-drama is based on the true story of Joe Gould, a bohemian eccentric who was a fixture in New York's Greenwich Village from his arrival in 1916 to his death in 1964. Gould, who claimed to be a graduate of Harvard, would cadge drinks and subsist on catsup as he regaled patrons of neighborhood saloons with stories, poems, opinions, and his imitation of a seagull. In a 1942 New Yorker profile by journalist Joseph Mitchell, Gould spoke of his life's work, a book entitled An Oral History of Our Times, which he claimed would be eleven times longer than the Bible, contain a variety of overheard conversations from throughout the years, and document the decline of 20th century culture. Mitchell kept tabs on Gould, and tried to introduce him to publishers who might put his work into print, but nothing ever came of it, and it wasn't until Gould's death that Mitchell discovered the surprising truth about his friend."
5,Brilliant.,I recently read Hob aloud to two kids (10 and 12) and we all had a ball. Every single time one of the kids had a question Mayne answered it in the very next sentence. He seems to have an almost magical understanding of the way kids' minds work. Hob's particular take on the world has warped us forever
2,Poor battery life,Battery noticeably starts losing the ability to hold its charge after 4 months. Wahl seems to be a better option.
4,Great Clipper,I've read all the good and bad reviews here and obviously it will depend on your beard as some people seem to not like this clippers but for me it is a great tool and works very well. This is my second unit as I bought one of this model when it first came out many years ago and it still works but I just decided to replace it with a shiny one. It is rare when I find a product good enough to repeat the old model instead of buying the new version or another brand. The company sent me a DOA unit but they replaced it in short order.
1,Mustache trimmer,"Not able to trim mustache close. You would have to have a bushy, thick mustache to work.Not satified at all."
1,Lame battery.,"One year, all parts are good as new, battery won't charge any more so I'm shopping for another. I'd have been happy to buy a replacement battery but couldn't find one."
2,meh.,"its alright. it cuts... but not close. and it tends to pull at hairs. i returned it after first use and got an andis trimmer. i was kind of upset, i expected a lot from this."
1,DON'T BUY THIS THING!,"This glorious product:1. Painfully pulls at hairs, with almost every stroke!2. Comes with two clip-on double-sided attachment combs, which are supposed to enable four different trimming lengths, but they all leave the hair too long. So forget about any nice, short and sharp facial hairstyles.3. Comes with three detachable trimmer blades (each one having a different width), but they all trim identically ""well"" (see point #1 above).Plus points:1. It's relatively quiet. So you it won't sound like you got a lawn mower in the bathroom. (However you might end up cursing and yelling in there by yourself...see point #1 above).2. Comes with a pair of scissors and a barbers comb, which are without a doubt the best things in the box on terms of hair grooming.3. It's a great paper weight.Conclusion: Skip this product."
3,Looks great but low on options,"This trimmer looks great and it has a shiney outside. The clippers work great but there aren't enough settings for the desired styles that I want to shape. I like to fade my beard so that the stubble starts at the tip of my side burns and I blend the hair down gradually getting thicker as I go toward my chin. What sucks is that the four settings on this thing don't allow me this option. 3mm, 6mm, 9mm, 12mm. At first it seems like these settings would be enough but I found that I would like something in between 3 and 6, and in between 6 and 9."
1,"Lacks precision trimming, Mulit, multi, multi pass trimmer at best","I needed to replace my old trimmer due to it's sheer age. I had hoped to at least get something equal. This is a multi pass trimmer at best, the comb attachments don't even properly line up with the blades, they are so far away from the comb it's necessary to go over and over and over the same area so many times and it still misses some. It looks nice, rechargeable is a nice feature. If only it worked as well as it looks."
2,Not as good as it should be!!!!,"I got this trimmer to replace my old Norelco.I was pleased by the way the trimmer itself was smaller than my Norelco and seemed well made.That idea came to a screeching halt once I had it charged and started to use it.The adapters to set the trim depth are poorly made and set crooked on the trimmer and come off even when not in use.I thought maybe it would improve as I got used to using it,not a chance.I have tried for a couple months to get accustomed to it and it is just poorly designed and not well thought out.I am stuck with this since the money back offer is only good for 30 days.You might get lucky and the adapters will fit on yours but it is taking a chance.Back to Norelco,they have a solid product that is well designed top to bottom,be careful and choose wisely."
1,Save your money,"This was a waste of money, a horrible investment. Spend the extra money and buy the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer. Now that's a real beard trimmer. The Remington has no power, short battery life, does not have sharp blades making you go over the same part over and over, and cuts one length only...stubble. It is useless. I used it 10 times and was disgusted. I bought the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer and have had the exact opposite experience."
2,Weak motor,"I bought this for myself to replace my previous Norelco trimmer (the plastic attachment's clip broke) and hated it. The motor seems weak, a charge only lasted for a couple of days it seemed. I used it once and went back to using my broken Norelco so I ended up returning it."
4,Interesting Book,"I thought this book was very interesting and I learned a few things. Somethings I had always known, some I just discovered recently like what the Emacipation Proclaimation was really all about and somethings I was surprised to learn while reading the book. The original book is almost 20 years old so many of the fallacies have been brought up a long time ago. Still if you are interested in history or myths and legends this book is great to have."
2,"Worth it, for a cheap price...","I've collected a wide variety of music over the years, including dance/techno/electronica...or whatever you want to call it. I get a kick out of hearing some of my favorite classic rock tunes ""modified"" a bit. True, some stuff can be annoying and hard to listen to.These dance versions of Queen's ""Flash"" by Vanguard are fairly disappointing. It starts out fun enough, with a thumping beat after the main chourus...and then really goes nowhere. I often imagine how people at a dance club would react to the break in the beats. It just wouldn't work. The additional mixes are not much different. If there's anything good to say, it's that I'm glad Vanguard didn't try to dub any other vocals. I have both CDs out there featuring the ""Flash"" remixes. Thankfully, I didn't pay much for either...and now I understand why."
4,Another great book in this series...,"This is the 3rd book in a 3 book series. I really enjoyed this book & the adventure along the way. I do feel though that the book was a bit rushed. I can't tell you how many errors I found in the writing. Many, many words left out & others added while some other sentences just didn't make any sense. I wished there had been a bit more mystery to the ""bad guys"" in this series rather than it all being laid right out for your but overall I loved the series & would highly recommend it."
5,Great for organizing....,"for sorting out screws (different sizes), nails, wire nuts, bits, bolts, rivets or anything you have laying around the house loose. I have 3 of these and they are perfect for what they do. Though kind of heavy when full, they have the strap in the middle which makes them easier to carry and a loose string to pull to tighten them up when there not that full. For the Handyman, they are excellent to have. You can store just about anything in them. You will appreciate the Milwaukee s Organizer."
3,Adequate,The organizer is smaller than I imagined. It seems a little flimsy and the material is thinner than I expected. I bought two but will probably only use one of them since the material is so thin.
3,I expected a better product from Milwaukee,I expected a better product from Milwaukee but the item fits its purpose. I have and like the Bucket Boss bag alot more it is a much better product.
5,Awesome!,"Love this DVD......he is such an emotional singer, you can really appreciate his talent more by seeing him perform. I can't get enough of James Blunt."
4,Sad vignettes,"This is a collection of stories of the near demise of Alexandria and how it occurred. For people who like that city today, it is important to read and examine its 20th c history, the tumult and the emigrations and this book helps accomplish this."
2,Boring story telling,"There has been a lot written about Alexandria, the pearl of the Mediteranean. Reading ths 'stories' in this books, fails to evoke the grandeur of this city. Having spent a few years there myself, the mundane stories in this book leave me uninterested."
1,Not for Hiking!!,I bought this shoe thinking that any ECCO would be a great shoe. Boy was I wrong. It is nowhere near as comfortable as my other ECCOs. After a short hike I had a horrible blister on one heel. The next day a blister developed on the other heel.I read reviews of this shoe and everyone seemed to like it and thought it was great for light hikes. Well I disagree. I would not recommend this shoe to wear even as just an everyday shoe. I doubt that I would ever wear it again. Too bad because it looks like such a nice shoe.
5,The Gold Book of Prayers,"This is the finest prayer book I have ever owned. I have bought many for friends and new Catholics as it covers such huge territory. It is easy to read, has scriptural rosary verses and prayers for every occasion. Buy a bunch for friends and family. You will not regret it."
3,Nothing special,"The book begins with Sam's grandfather trading him from the first place Gladiators soccer team to the worst team in the league, the Tigers. Team doesn't have a coach. So Sam's dad steps into the coaching role and recruits two talented players who lead the team to its first win. Soon, Dad becomes all about winning just like his father, Sam's grandfather.The story is similar to THE COMEBACK KIDS except it focuses on Dad's coaching and his growing desire to win while sacrificing teamwork. The book won't be a classic. It's awkward as the author has the challenge of translating the movie into books for easy readers. It teaches about competition, good sportsmanship and teamwork. The book targets kids ages four through eight, uses color photos from the movie and readable text for emerging readers."
5,The Meg & Dia Band,"The first time I listened to a few songs I was already hooked. I then found out about their first album ""Our Home Is Gone"". Now, I can't go a day without listening to these beautiful girls. Every song on their album ""Something Real"" is awesome."
5,Im ADDICTED to this song,Ive never heard of Meg and Dia but i was watching music video previews on MTV2 and i saw the preview for Monsters... I love this song from them and now i love their music!!!
1,Terrible Towels (and I'm not talking about the Steelers),"These towels were rated ""excellent"" by Cooks Illustrated but they're awful! They aren't absorbent and they're the size of bath cloths. Think twice before buying."
2,Faded Reallllly bad,These dish cloths are nice once they QUIT fading in the wash. I now have shades of green and orange EVERYTHING.
1,Disapponting,NOT a good towel unless you want to use them to line your muffin basket. They are so thin they are almost see-through.
5,A nice end to fun TV series,"This is the last episode (a double-episode actually) of Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide that first aired on June 8, 2007.Like the rest of the series, this is a light-hearted look at middle-school through the eyes of Ned, Cookie, and Moze. The class goes on a field trip to the fictional Huffington Library and most of the story takes place on location -- a first for the series and a nice change. (Though the library is based on Huntington Gardens in Pasadena, CA, the episode was actually shot at Descanso Gardens in La Cañada Flintridge, CA.)Does Ned end up with Suzy or Moze? You'll have to tune in to find out but, its worth the wait."
5,"Funny, . . . maybe not original at certain times, . . . but decent.","I couldn't help but write something for this show. I haven't bought the DVD, . . .I'm hoping for a full series DVD.I'm, also, an adult . . . But, I could be considered a ""Big Kid.""Even though the show is geared towards children, it's not close to being immature or childish.I think this is basic new school ideas for teens that may be growing up fast or that may have wisdom beyond their age.So, if you're looking to give your child something encouraging to watch while keeping them happy or entertained, . . give them this gift. Though, this is the finale and some background into the characters may be helpful.Nickelodeon is slightly similar to Disney, although their humor and cartoons can be slighty edgier at times.Other Nicktoons of note, that fly under the radar, are Jimmy Neutron, Fairly Oddparents, and Avatar: The Last Airbender.Peace"
5,VERY FUNNY!!,This movie is highly under rated. I ran across this show on tv and was hooked. It's funny and it's made for the whole family. Ned Bigby and his two friends Cookie and Moze have a bunch of mishaps while on a school field trip (that they were banned from). This dvd also includes 2 episodes from the show. I just love this show!!! I can't wait to get the first season on dvd.
2,Sloppy book--Ned whats your advise to fix,"First off-- the pages are out of order and even repeated. How they could sell a book like this is beyond belief. Go to a bookstore to check out the book first (Cookie's page is repeated by Moze's profie as if she were a volleyball/compuetr geek!!) Other than that is as if Ned published a ""Letterman"" top 10 list based on facts from the show..."
1,Bad Knife - Used?? Was advertised as new!,This knife needed to be sent back to Cutco for repair/sharpening. I doubt that it was new. Probably used for quite a while. Would use this supplier again.
2,UH! UH!,"I really enjoyed Coffee and Kung fu and was looking forward to this one.Unfortunately, I felt extremely let down.I really disliked the back and forth (present and past) continuous ride we had to take in order to get through this book. At any given time, I wasn't sure if I was in the past or in the present.I really would have preferred the storytelling being told in one period. I know that the basis of the book was to ""go back in time"" but, for me, it really did not work and completely removed my enjoyment of the book."
4,Tired of all the usual Christmas shows?,"I was tired of the usual fare of Christmas shows that are seen countless times each season. These gems are wonderful, and something the kids never get tired of. Besides, who can resist Disney at Christmas since both names are synonomous with MAGIC! and that is what this video is."
4,It's Disney all over,"I found this collection of Christmas stories absolutly delightful. It' been a long time since I've seen it, so I can't say much about it. I do remember that I was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie has new themes instead of the boring old Christmas-spirt stuff. The chipmunks are especially funny, at least my family thought so."
1,Temptations Live,"I thought I was purchasing Temptations Live at the Copa and it turns out this isn't that album so I am very dissatisfied.The Temptations used many different arrangements for the music they played during their live performances to add variety, but the arrangements on this album aren't their best. Much of the music just drags and the classic songs sound much more like they originated in a bowling alley lounge rather than in the hearts and minds of one of the best R&B; groups that has ever played a note."
2,nothing special,"I am a long time Pink Floyd fan and have purchased David Gilmores earlier albums. I was thinking to buy his old stuff on CD format when I saw that he had this new album. Sorry David, but I didn't find anything outstanding here. I like you but I'd, rather some classic ummagumma or your first or 2nd solo. Thanks anyway."
4,Enjoyable,"The unconventional in the subtitle ""An Unconventional Guide to the Eighteenth Century"" is a little deceiving. This reader expected to find curiosities large and small, such as Mr. Washington's false teeth in an exegesis to show how different that century was from the ones we grew up in.The unconventianility is really Mr. Darnton's insinuation of himself into the text with many allusions from the 18th century to ours. It's ok - it's a historian's sin he cheerily admits up front. So Paris's informal political communication networks of gossip, handbills, songs, subversive literature, et al. focuses on ... well ... the King's sex life. There's more to it than that, of course, but still, in all a lot like the internet and a certain recent president.The last chapter, ""The Skeletons in the Closet: How Historians Play God"" is worth the price of admission."
1,Whatever,"Anyone who teaches at Princeton shouldn't be allowed to publish a book with the words ""false teeth"" on the cover!"
2,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!!,"I bought this camera for my daughter for Christmas. I looked at quite a few. I can tell you that this camera takes excellent pictures, has a real nice large display, a nice look and a nice grip/feel to it. ALL the benefits are completely obliterated by the fact that the camera ABSOLUTELY DEVOURS batteries like there's no tomorrow. Buy this camera if you dare but be prepared to ""babysit"" the batteries for the rest of the cameras life. . The batteries will die UNBELIEVEABLY QUICKLY, predictably and consistently. This fact cannot be underestimated enough. It was a bad investment. To make matters worse, you get a short little abreviated user manual in the box while the website has a complete owners manual detailing every aspect of the camera. I called customer service and the wanted to charge me $20.00 for the book. Another raw deal!"
2,S1050 Review,"Very disappointed with this camera when shooting in low light conditions. Lots of noise when shoting in ISO200 and above.When shooting indoor, most of the images turns out to be blurr at 1/20.Anti-Vibrations doesn't seems to improve image blurr.But in outdoor lighting, photos taken are impressive!If you don't mind using tripod all the time when shooting indoor, this camera will be fine as it comes with manual control for you to play around with the settings."
4,surprising,"Plenty of battery life with rechargeables. I have had no problems with batteries. Great features and specs for the price. The most surprising is how nice photos with flash look. Even up close results are soft and highlights are not blocked up and washed out. The large viewing area is helpful for eyes which are not as good as they used to be. I would like a viwfinder option, though. This camera doesn't have one."
3,Great camera,"This is my first review, although I am a frequent reader. The samsung digimax S1050 is a feature packed camera with everything I wanted. But there are some serious flaws. Primarily the software, it is poorly laid out and extremely volatile, kind of like the blue screen of death. I have developed a loyalty to samsung after a series of excellent products, but I am not blind. I was spoiled by how rock solid canon was, samsung hopefully will offer a flash to fix this. The features severely decreased image quality. Motion control changed 10mp camera into a 1 mp webcam. It had quite a lag for it's autofocus. For point and shoot though, I believe it is one of the best you can get. Seriously I am just pointing out the worst, It doesn't happen all the time."
1,does not work,"I bought the camara and with every single picture that I tried to take, the camara will have a problem. Example will shut down or display a low battery sign even thought I tried 2 different sets of new batteries, the lences will no work corectply or the click will get stuck."
2,Problems,"I bought 5 of these of Christmas presents now just a little over a year later only one works mostly due to the fact that it's owner does not use it much. Battery problems, overheating etc. Avoid. I am a die hard Samsung fan but this is a bad camera."
5,The best of my 28 years in sobriety,"Nan Robertson's book is the most accurate I have ever read concerning Alcoholics Anonymous. She is devoted to AA, but more so to her research and her honest in writing. If I had to read one book concerning AA, this would be the one. Robert F. Hale"
3,Intriguing verification of historical reality,"Potter's book does much to validate the historical Jesus though does not complement accepted traditional teachings. For inspiration I found R. Patton's ""THE Autobiography"" infinitely more satisfying. Potter has done a commendable job of collating factual information that doesn't unquestioningly swallow orhtodoxy. A valuable reference tool."
1,Gnostic Arrogance,"Dr. Potter's book is a joyful gloat that ancient texts were found that shed doubt on the deity of Jesus Christ.Dr. Potter chastises ""ignorant"" fundamentalists everywhere for attributing the miracles of Christ to the power of God, rather than the power of the human mind. ..."
3,Mop and broom holder,"Again I'm waiting for my move - but it looks like what I wanted it for the job, and it looks good."
4,broom holder works for me,"this is a good product, esp for a small space (i use inside linen closet). sticky tape doesnt really work, works better screwed in."
4,Great for the price,It does it's job. The double stick tape didn't work so I had to find a space to screw it into a wall. But otherwise this is a great product for the price!
3,mop/broom holder,"nice product but not big enough to hold all of the things I needed hanging. the hooks are awkward and didn't fit the items I needed hung next to the brooms.... meaning I couldnt hang the duster and dust pan next to each other - not enough room- and the hooks are small and can't hold what i needed it to. and like i said, all items can't be hung at the same time. i do not recommend this product."
3,great,"This is a great product and works just as described. I originally wrote a stellar review, however, I received an email urging me to revise my review. So since you feel it necessary to bug your busy customers to write a review and not be willing to take whatever it is they have to say, I hope this is more to your liking."
3,Its Ok,I received It wail ago and it just OK not that happy with it !It did not fit all my my mop nor the little broom which suppose to be hanged!
2,stayed on the wall for 2 months,"In a perfect world, something this cheap would actually work. Now, I will look for something more expensive which is what I should have done in the first place."
4,Nice space saver,Ordered this product to keep my stuff organized in my small pantry. This organizer is very easy to put up. I will be ordering one for my sister I am so happy with it.
4,Great little broom/mop storage,Pretty pleased with this item. It was easy to mount to the wall and holds quite a bit of weight. My only complaint is the holders for the broom stick is a bit difficult to remove the broom or mop from. It's nothing to major just takes a bit of wiggling to get them in and out.
1,Not worth the cost,"Just not worth it. The broom handles kept falling off prior to installation, also annoying to remove the handles. I also purchased the Evriholder Magic Holder 5 position wall organizer at practically the same cost and loved it.Would not suggest anyone to purchase this."
2,"It was OK, small but just OK.","I was not so impressed with the broom organizer. Yes it is doing what I want but is is smaller then expected. Not real high quality, but then again it didn't cost much either. So I guess it's another lesson in...you get what you pay for."
3,Fell often and holes are small,This product works as intended but you cannot hang many brooms/mops because the weight will pull it off the wall. We had to glue it to the wall because the stickers could not hold it. The holes are also smaller than some of our brooms/mops so make sure your handles are thin before ordering!
5,Really Helpful,I installed this in my pantry. It was easy to mount. It's great for making extra space and organizing your cleaning tools.
3,works ok,"This contains a super sticky piece of double sided tape, so you can hang it on your wall without tools, which is great. The other great part is that it holds my swiffer with no problems as it hangs on one of the hooks. However, my brook- which has no handle or grip will only stay op for about an hour before it slides out of the circular grip. So, my broom is right back where it was under this thing on the floor. It's cheap, so it's not too disappointing... but I do wish I could use it for what I intended. That dang broom."
2,Things stay in,"Things also go up, but not down. Hooks in the middle should be deeper, you can hardly hang anything on them."
2,Great for small light weight items,"I use this for my dust pans, and fly swatters. It does not work as well on my heavy corn broom or she mops."
2,Not what it looks like,"It sounds like a great idea and I was really excited to complete the project. However, it has taken me TONS of time and I had to go buy new glue to even get it to work. The kit comes with really useless glue in a horribly inefficient dispenser. The glue doesn't hold corks in. Not to mention the corks never quite fit right so your cork board will never look like the example picture. I wish I hadn't wasted my time and money."
4,Wine lovers unite,"Always wanted one of these products, the only issue is wanting to complete it right away but not having enough corks at the ready."
3,Color,"It wasn't what I expected. The color of the wood was yellow and not very attractive,Other then that it was OK."
4,Great gift for a wine aficionado,"This makes a great gift for someone who drinks (a lot) of wine. There's some work involved - glueing the corks on the board. But it's a nice project. And each time your giftee glues, s/he will be thinking of you..."
3,You Supply the Corks,"I know. It's obvious and I should have read the instructions more carefully, but the picture is a little deceiving. Giving it 3 stars because of that, but other than my mistake, very nicely built!"
5,Great Product,I got this for my brother who is a wine lover and he really thought it was neat! I would buy this product again for a gift.
4,Wine cork board,"Just the gift we were looking for. The seller sent it quickly, well-packed and it was exactly as advertised with a price lower than others we looked at so we were very pleased."
4,"Great cause, silly creature reference","By ""Newt Samander"" (aka J.K. Rowling), it is otensibly, Harry Potter's textbook, a compendium of the non- human or -wizard species one might run across. For Harry's fans in need of a between-edition fix, this is a work for the charity Comic Relief. The entries vary from the familiar fairies and ghouls and unicorns to creatures I can't help wondering if Rowling's fertile imagination contrived: froopers and lobalugs and mackled malaclaws. Fortunately,the text notes each critter's Ministy of Magic Classification from one X (boring) to five X (known wizard killer) so studious types will know whether to worry about a Chizpurfle (XX) more or a Quintaped (XXXXX) more, should one encounter such. Included are sophomoric doodles by both Harry and Ron Weasley. Silly fun. Great characters, no plot!"
4,Harry Potter Fan,"I thought this would be a neat addition to the other Harry Potter books, and it is. Just a little disappointed in the length (very short), but it has the same style of JK Rowling's writtings and was entertaining."
3,Slower than normal being shipped,Book was in condition as described but it took a few days to leave the sellers place of business.We received the book within the time alloted but it was much longer than any other books I have bought.
2,Disappointing,"After reading all seven Harry Potters and the Tales of Beedle the Bard, I find the Fantastic Beasts dissapointing.It's just a list of wild and segamented imagination. Of course, you may say, all novels are out of imagination. You're right. But the imagination in this book is just dull, tedious and not funny."
2,written in book,"The book was written in ink from a child all over the first few pages, i wish that had been told on here before i bought it. But other than that it is in ok condition."
3,"Good book, but not as advertised","When I looked for this book, I wanted a hardback copy. I found this listed under such copies and at a reasonable price so I ordered it. I received it within the said time, but when it arrived, it was paperback, not hardback like categorized. That's is the main thing I am disappointed in, but other than that, the book is good. I suggest the seller advertise this book correctly next time under ""paperback"" so people don't expect a longer-lasting hardback book in the place of a flimsy, bendable book."
5,<3,"Love, love, love it. I hope she writes more of their ""school"" books. She's just brilliant. I love everything Harry Potter."
2,"""Used"" is too nice a term.","I was disappointed because it came with a folded back cover, and a small rip on the front, which upset me, because it is a gift for my little brother. It also has small amounts of residue on the back, a pencil mark on the front, and a stain in the bottom of the crease, that you can see on every page. It is much thinner than I expected, it's maybe 1/4 of an inch give or take a little, But that isn't a big issue. I would recommend buying it new, or hardcover."
3,A little short of stuff but it will do,I really expected more graffiti and more fabulous creatures. And alot of the creature descriptions were similar and confusing. But it was a good reference for the Harry Potter series. It helped me understand alot more about the creatures that made it more vivid in my mind.
4,Never got it,"As much as I know this book was going to be amazing, unfortunately I never got it. =( Of course I am not saying it was the sender's fault, something may have happened in the mail. But as for this book, I can say it is amazing work done by J. K. Rowling and a must for people who not only love Harry Potter, but also have an interest in amazing creatures or who have an artist's eye"
3,"Lots of political, organizational and technical detal","I was looking for a good introduction and foundation for understanding Concorde and I thought this book along with Orlebar's would do the trick.I was very disappointed with this one, though. It devotes lots and lots of words to (from my point of view) arcane historical and political issues. After a couple chapters I just gave up and returned this book. I was very happy with the Orlebar and Calvert books.If you're interested in the detailed very insider-oriented story of Concorde, this may be the book for you. (And it appears from a number of the reviewers that it was interesting for them.)"
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I bought this book hoping to find out new stories about Montreal but would have to agree with the reviewer who said it's mostly recycled and well-known stories. It's a meagre little book with not much in the way of illustrations or photos and each chapter starts with a question, probably meant as a sort of riddle, but then the answer is written right below. I found that irritating."
3,not the Ultimate,"Unless you are looking for these specific recordings, I don't think this is your best choice. The title is misleading: Jackie McLean chose from among VERVE recordings of Charlie Parker. If you're looking for a good overview, best of, or first/second Charlie Parker CD to add to your collection -- Keep shopping, is my opinion."
1,Forget it.,"Sorry, folks, if you liked ""Acadie"" for it's diversity and beauty, don't expect to find it on this CD. It felt like one, long, boring song set in a standard rock idiom. Yawn! ""Acadie"", however, is wonderful!"
2,Surprisingly disappointing,"I came to this album out of a love for Lanois' sound (as displayed beautifully on U2's ""Love is Blindness"" and Dylan's ""Man in the Long Black Coat""), but found I don't much care for his writing. With the exception of the stunning ""...Marie Claire"" the songs just don't resonate.To comment on Lucas Rex's review: I would bet the words ""America Edition"" are entirely about ruining the cover. It's just a guess, but I suspect that there was a dust up about distributing the album in America so the words ""American Edition"" were so-carefully placed over the cover art. Ahhh....Smell the Glove."
2,Not First Choice,"Although this book shares some good information and common sense, if you yourself are dealing with a hearing loss (as the book suggests), you will not find an unbiased opinion here. Stressing oralism (lipreading and listening with assistive listening devices), there is no talk of sign language whatsoever herein. If you're losing your hearing, but vow to never admit you're deaf (when the loss becomes that severe) and vow that you will stay in the ""hearing world"" at all costs, this is the book for you to read as you live in denial. However, if you are truly open to learning about every option offered you as a hard of hearing or deaf person, don't waste your time. That's just this deafie's opinion. :o)"
1,Unlucky?,"Perhaps I got unlucky, and hopefully others will review this, but the one I received was either broken or poorly designed.It would release and renew the IP lease every 60 seconds on my WAN connections. This meant any persistent connection would be lost every minute. If you happened to be playing an internet game it would go poof every 60 seconds. Not a very useful thing to have. There was no way to tell it to stop doing that either. Perhaps I had a bad one and am in the minority. I'm hoping others post reviews so I can find out. I'd love to have one of these but the next cheapest Dual WAN router is $200 by XinCom."
2,"Not enough ""romance"" in this ""romance novel"".","Believe me when I say I wanted desperately to like this book. I have been searching for years to find an African-American historical romance novel.My critique with this story is not the ""idea"", the idea in itself is brilliant: a beautiful headstrong woman out West alone who meets a very virile & handsome outlaw who is just as attracted to her as she is to him. It wasn't until I had gotten half way through the book did I realize that although there was chemistry between our heroine and this outlaw nothing was happening. It was as if they were both AFRAID of one another. I know it was suppose to be because she was ""innocent"" and he was ""wanted in her town"". However I couldn't help but ponder why Mrs Jenkins the author didn't have the characters flirt more with one another. This BUBBLEGUM romance won't make you blush in the least. I bought the book 3 months ago and couldn't finish it."
4,Beverly Jenkins normally can do no wrong,"I enjoyed this book. I read it years ago. I do/did not like it that the Publisher's put half caucasian looking woman on a Historically Black Novel Cover. Can we get some true to the times covers. Anyway, the Hero was annoying to me. And, the Heroinne had more sexual experience. Odd. I liked it, but I didn't really like them as a couple. Pretty good book though. Loved the twins."
5,Good Girl... Bad Boy... Great Story,"This is one of Mrs. Jenkins best work to date. I really enjoyed the Edge of Dawn, but I enjoyed this even more. The main characters intrigue you from the very beginning but I really fell in love with the supporting characters. The town of Henry Adams became very real to me and it was like I lived there. Any author that can do that is absolutely awesome.Kendy Ward"
5,Another Great One!!,"Why hasn't Oprah discovered this author? We have and again Ms Jenkins has not disappointed and done it again. She has shown that she can go from historical, young adult, contemporary and back to historicals. In Something Like Love she brought back characters we are all familiar with and put together a story that you hate to see end. I plan to read this book again while I sit on the porch waiting for a Neil July. Keep up the good work, Ms Lady."
5,A wonderful good-girl bad-boy love story!!!!,"This book is my favorite Beverly Jenkins novel. This is a story that proves that love can conquer all. In this story, the love of a spinster named Olivia broke down the bad-boy determination of Neil July, an outlaw from a family of outlaws. It was her love for him that earned him his freedom in the end and the two make such a wonderful couple. As you are reading it, you remember that bad boy you liked when you were growing up and how he made you feel. This story warms the heart as well as the soul. It takes place in the wild west, but makes you feel like a movie screen in Hollywood! You will not be disappointed if you read this book!"
5,Another great story from Mrs Jenkins,"This is another great connecting story. Read Night Song, Topaz, The Taming of Jessie Rose, Always and Forever to get the background on the town of Henry Adams, Kansas and on the secondary characters. Hope Two Shafts, Teresa and Preacher meet their match in the future."
5,WOW!!!,I couldn't put this book down if I wanted too. I first read about Neil and his Brother Two Shaft in The Taming Of Jessi Rose and fell in love with them both. I couldn't stop laughing at there antics I actually read the book again. I really can't wait for Two Shafts story or that of there sister. Keep up the good work Ms. Jenkins:)
4,Coloured Pencil Portraits,An excellent book to get started on coloured pencil portraits. So glad I bought it but also will buy a video by the author as I feel I need this to accompany the book in places. I am a visual learner
4,Good book!,"It shows you the best way to draw portraits in colored pencils. I've only give it 4 stars because I've realized that the only way to learn how to draw is by doing it. Take picture you really like and draw it over and over until you get it right. And be patience,YOU WILL LEARN but with time. If you want to learn how to draw something specific like. Don't buy a lot books like I did. It's not worth it. I hope this help."
2,"mostly a see it, do it, type book","Like many of the ""see it, do it"", type books that are typically written by visual artists, who imagine their target audience is just like themselves; this book tends to gloss over alot of details that would make it helpfull to those who buy this sort of material."
2,this isn't a book for beginners,"This isn't a book for beginners. Although, Kullgerg's portraits are beautiful to look at. I feel I haven't seen all the technigues needed to complete a portrait for myself. I think this book would have been helpful if it had guided me more on light."
2,Doesn't work miracles,"If creating natural-looking, and expressionate scenes of realistic people through your own creativity is what you're looking to achieve, I'd look for other books. Art is a form of expression and interpretation (portraiture as well!), if you follow the methods in this book to creating a portrait you'll find yourself denied of these privileges. DON'T think that this book will teach you to draw *real* people from your mind, basically what you're doing is enlarging a photograph on paper with colored pencil. Portraits can be lots more fun than doing this.However, I have to say I learned a little bit more about colored pencils by reading this book and the drawings were nice to look at, which is why I gave it 2 stars. But I've read it maybe twice in the past two months, and so far only picked it up once more to find out the title of the book to write this review."
1,NOT GOOD AT ALL!!,So much material is left out. I have read many more interesting colored pencil books. My opinion. Fl
4,Colored Pencil Portraits,"For someone getting started using colored pencils to draw portraits (and even for the somewhat more advanced Art student), this book is an excellent step-by-step guide. Included are many examples by the very talented author of the book, Ann Kullberg."
5,Excellent resource,"I bought this book after taking several classes in drawing and it now is my favorite ""teacher."" The chapter on drawing hair resulted in huge improvements in my techniques and outcomes, and her information on mixing colors for skin and shadows very helpful. I highly recommend this book."
3,Portraits,This is a good book but does not give assistance with drawing portraits as much as it deals with the handling of colors. I did not find it as helpful as I wished.
2,Beware of the niacin flush,"I had been having success with taking 2 grams of another brand of melatonin to help me sleep through the night and wanted to see if I could lower the dose. I usually find NOW products to be reliable and of high quality and this product may be also, but it is definitely not for me. For some reason, this product contains a very high dose (100 mg) of niacin, which in such doses can have the side effect of producing a rather profound flush, increased heart rate and other unpleasant symptoms. After taking this product (one pill) for only two nights, I found I was waking every two hours soaked in sweat with my heart pounding, which has never happened to me before with melatonin. I quit taking it and am no longer having those symptoms.I'm not sure how to score it because for some people the flush may not occur or may not be as severe. I would advise caution with this product."
1,Why would you add B vitamins?,"We have used Melatonin to help our son who has ADHD fall asleep. Other brands have worked great and we couldn't figure out why it stopped working. We noticed that this brand has B vitamins included in it, which has had the opposite affect with our son- keeping him wide awake, for hours.I'll take responsibiity for not noticing the label, but why would you put something that gives people more energy (B vitamins) into a sleep aid?"
5,great service,"I received better delivery service from this vendor in Austria than many in my own ""back yard""."
4,Firefly... Waterfall,"An uniquely written book with an amazing tone, with a deeply profound story of lost and its effect on a family written by it's middle child. I was feeling this fast read was going to be near perfect, being packed with so much acute vulnerability, but then the ending or the lack there of an ending put a damper on my exuberance. So if you have pathos for books of this ilk, you will find reading this book one soul soothing release from the harshness of everyday life."
5,Excellence,"I read this book when it came out several years ago and just finished it for the second time and still can't believe how powerful the story is and how well the book is written. I knew Sean (Kathleen's younger brother) all the way through grade school and went to his house several times to visit him over the years. I considered myself a close friend of Sean's and never realized what was going on his life until reading this book. I always wondered why a young, extremely bright, good looking kid would even contemplate such a fate. It's extremely well written and I would recommend it to anyone."
5,wonderful,I enjoyed this book. I thought it was beautifully written. This is one of my favorite books I have ever read. While it was sad it also had humor and love. It appears Shawn has never been forgotten by his loving family. I would highly recommend this wonderful read to all!!!
4,Watch the Guardian at least once...,"Really enjoyed this movie overall, telling a tale of the United States Coast Guard was enlightening. They expose much in the way of the life of a rescue swimmer, and really what the USCG is all about. Ashton Kutcher is well-chosen in the role he plays as the competitive young adult just beginning in his training and career as a rescue swimmer. Special Features on this flick are great to watch, educational. Alternate ending is available in the special features, which I must admit I preferred over the one they chose for the big screen. Very Kevin Costner-ish. Though he is a superb actor, there is a certain hero-like quality that he always wants to impress upon you in his movies, which I don't care for. Regardless, I still recommend this movie, well-made and obvious that there was a lot put into the authenticity of it. Watch it at least once."
2,I've seen it all before,"Haven't been able to finish the film...seems like I've seen this before. It's the Coast Guard version of ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" and ""Top Gun"". Predictable? Yes, very. Who can't forsee the recruit falling for the local girl and who couldn't forsee a bar fight? And the hotshot upstart(the ""Tom Cruise caracter"") who rubs the brass the wrong way but in the end comes to terms (""Officer and Gentleman"").On the positive side the action at the beginning of the film was great and reminds us what these fabulous Coast Guard guys have to do. I would recommend the movie to those who haven't seen the earlier (and better) versions of this film but for those who have.....rent, don't buy."
2,"The Poor Man's ""Officer and a Gentleman""","Being a member of the CG Auxiliary I had high hopes for this movie. I was very disappointed. What could have been a good but often told tale of ""the old veteran training young upshots"" quickly degenerated into a rip-off of the vastly superior ""Officer and a Gentleman,"" right down to the spray-the-young-recruit-with-a-hose scene. The only good things were Kutcher's love interest, and the old lady who owned the bar Costner's character frequents; good actresses. And the ending where Costner's character kills himself made no sense at all. Dumb! Save your money and rent the Richard Gere/Debra winger classic instead."
3,the guardian,I like it alot but it was scary in some places for litte kid nowone under 13 shud see this
3,I have to have,a good ending for me to think it is a good movie. I can read the paper everyday to get a movie with a bad ending. THe actors were great. The story line was good so why they spoil the ending is a mystery to me!
3,water and more water,The story was a bit predictable. I did enjoy the rescue scenes in Alaska. What a tough job. I liked the alternate ending better than the one chosen for the movie. What's wrong with a happy ending?
5,An amazing tale of courage and sacrifice,"Ben Randall is a veteran Coast Gurad rescue swimmer. After a tragic accident he is reassigned to an instructors position. He meets a new recruit named Jake Fischer. Jake is more concerned with breaking Senior Chief Randall's records than learning how to save lives. Randall takes him under his wing and learns what motivates the young upstart. They become friends and after graduation a dangerous mission changes their fates forever.This is an incredible movie. The acting, story and drama in The Guardian are all amazing. It also has an ending that will shoot you right through the heart. There are a lot of movies out there, but not many are rewatchable and worth owning. This movie is both. You can watch it again and again, it never loses its impact. I think everyone should see it."
4,The Guardian,This is a very good movie about our U.S. Coast Guard and how they train. Kevin Costner was excellent in this miovie and Ashton Kutcher was the wiseguy in the movie but gave a good performance.
4,The Guardian,I thought this movie was great. It gives you some insight to what the Coast Guard does.
3,Entertaining enough,"I was attracted to this by the rescue scenes in ""The Perfect Storm"", which alerted me to the fact that US Coast Guard swimmers actually jump into raging seas to rescue people.So, was this a fitting tribute to the courageous men and women of the US Coast Guard who put their lives on the line for mariners in distress? To be honest, I thought they deserved better than this rather formulaic, predictable story (especially the odd beginning and matching end). The sea rescue scenes are well done, and you cannot help but admire the people who really do this for a living. In that regard, the film succeeds very well. The training/rivalry/romance bits are just the usual old Hollywood boilerplate grafted on, things you've seen many times before. Kevin Costner, who can be very good, does a sort of strong, silent wooden Indian impersonation, and the young hotshot is, well, a typical Hollywood hotshot.Nevertheless, there are worse ways of spending a couple of hours (it was rather long too)."
4,A fun movie with high quality video and audio,This movie is very entertaining to watch on a regular DVD but the experience is very much enhanced with the Blu-Ray Disk. The video is stunning and the audio is very good. I enjoyed seeing Ashton Kutcher in a dramatic role for a change. He is still very funny in the outtakes.
3,I liked it,"I liked it because it was the typical ""hero gives his life for the sake of his mate"" but with a twist: the Coast Guard.The end was predictable, but the movie in itself was fun to watch, Kutcher is always good looking, and Kostner too.It has a bit of everything: some parts are fun, there are action, plus romance, and we learn a few things about those true heroes that are those saving lives for the Coast Guard....It was like An officer and a gentleman, but in the Coast Guard school, and true officers of the Coast Guard are included in the cast, and that gives the movie a true meaning."
2,2 Stars Due To Costner,Kevin Costner was great in this movie. Thank God for him or this movie would receive 1 star. Movie worth renting not buying.Ashton Kutcher should have taken lessons from his wife on how to act. Demi was great in G.I. Jane. Ashton is terrible in this movie. He has no acting skills what- so- ever. I guess I just do not get the Ashton Kutcher thing. I see him pertaining to 5 -12 year olds but that is all.His Hoo Rah is a total embarrassment for the Navy and Marines.
5,The Guardian- Awesome Movie!,This was a very inspiring movie about the US Coast Guard search and rescue teams. Me and my children loved the movie!
4,Good movie,Good movie. Surprising role for actors. quick shipping. This movie is all about heroes.Very good story. Not used to seeing Ashton Kutcher play a serious role.
3,I liked it,"This movie was pretty much Top Gun but the Coast Guard instead of the Navy, and ashton Kutcher instead of Tom Cruise. As a big Top Gun fan I gave it a try, and it amused."
4,Coast Guardian,"I as many I'm sure feel that the Coast Guard is underappreciated. This movie does for CG rescue divers what ""Men of Honor"" did for Navy divers. This movie not only shows great character development, but it gives some pretty good background into how training and operations are conducted in the Coast Guard. Fans of movies like ""Top Gun"", ""An Officer and a Gentlemen"", and ""Men of Honor"" will want to catch it for sure. Well worth checking out and with a great story, acting, and music it is good family entertainment. Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher give stand out performances. I recommend you at least rent it, and I think may drama fans will want to purchase it."
5,Great Movie!,"Despite the fact that it may not have the originality that other reviewers have pointed it out, it's a great movie. It brings a lot of emotions to the surface. Laughed and cried with the movie. Excellent jobs by the actors."

1,uggghhhh!!,"i like costner and kutcher just fine and wanted to like this movie, but (oh jesus!!!!!!!!!) it was awful. The screenplay was utter [..], leading us to devastatingly horrible acting. I could watch it again and try to give it another shot, but it is just not worth it. I remember sitting in the movie theater and cringing in the pain of how horrible it was to watch this. Watch at your own risk!!"
5,THE GUARDIAN TWO THUMBS UP!!,"this movie was just wonderful period. watch it, and after another nine dollars is going to fly out of you pocket liek me to watch it again.QUESTION: The song at the end of the movie...whats teh name of the song? adn where can i get the soundtrack/original score?"
5,The Guardian,Great movie!! I have watched it several times.It is very realistic and I am now aware of what the Coast Guard does and the specialized division of the rescue swimmers.
2,Retire and . . . what?,"If you learn by example this book is for you. It is filled with stories about other people who have successfully made the transition from one long term career to another. Supposedly this proves that it can be done. However, the book is also laced with statistics and other information that will make you think twice about trying. Rather than giving encouragement, as the title suggests, this book is really quite frightening. It is not a ""how to"" book. Nor did I find it helpful."
5,My sister requests these every year,"I'm too old and fat for these panties... but my 30 year-old sister asks for more every Xmas & birthday. She loves them. As a gift-buyer, I like that they come in lots of colors so I don't have to repeat buy. Customer service is good and they arrive fairly quickly. I'm sorry they aren't covered by amazon prime.... but otherwise this is an easy and appreciated gift."
5,Excellent toy for chewers.,"This is one of the only dog toys that we have bought that was not destroyed within minutes. We have an 9 month old mastiff/shepard mix that can chew through almost anything, toys had become non-existent in our home as he would tear them apart in minutes. I bought this ball with high hopes that it would last for a week or so anyway...well we are going on a month and the ball is totally still intact. This is our pups favorite toy and gets chewed on daily. Would not hesitate buying another one."
3,Planet Dog Orbee-Tuff Soccer Ball,"Very big and very heavy ball. Defiantly not for a beagle. + side, probably will never break. Won't buy again."
3,One tuff ball!,"I like the heaviness of the ball; that part is durable. I was a little disappointed that there is a big hole in it along the seam line. My pup uses that to pick up the ball and that's good, but if the hole is necessary, I would like to see it in a different place on the ball and not in the seam line. In a matter of 2 days the ball is starting to come apart at the seam. In order make the ball last I have to put it up as soon as play time is over. So, this ball, with the large hole where it now is, is best for a dog that is not a heavy chewer."
3,Early Tear in Hole from *ONLY* Retrieving,"My 60-lb, 7-month-old Old English Sheepdog puppy and I only play retrieve with this ball. She has a soft (very gentle) mouth, and is not a chewer. We have not had this soccer ball very long, and it is already tearing at the large (manufactured) hole. I gave it 3 stars because it is a fun toy to play with, but it gets zero stars for durability."
5,It's still alive after a couple of weeks,"Most toys die a quick and untidy death around my house - I have three dogs, and two are avid toy chewers. Stuffed toys last about 35 minutes before squeakers are ripped out and toy guts are strewn across the house like so much fluffy carnage. This toy is bouncy, it smelled good, it's small enough for the littler dogs to play with, but large enough for the larger dog to enjoy carrying around and laying on (she likes to sit w/ her ball under her front legs). Five stars for sturdiness."
2,small dog toy,"The Planet Dog Orbee-Tuff Soccer Ball is too heavy to be kicked and caught by a smaller dog. I have a boston terrier/beagle mix (30 lbs.)that loves playing with balls, and has enjoyed the type of soccer ball that is inflatable with a semi-durable cover. We thought we would try this one, since the other is no longer available/offered in our area. Otherwise, this ball seems very durable and may be more suitable for a larger dog."
2,"Not as ""tuff"" as other Orbee-Tuff","I really like Orbee-tuff's products: the football, orange ball and snowball, are still here 4 months later with no signs of damage. However, the soccer ball did not stand up against my bull terrier. Within a day my dog had somehow split the ball along it's pentagon ""seams"" and I watched him just happily pulled chunks off and spit them out. The soccer ball went into the trashcan in pieces.I recommend Orbee-Tuff -- just not this one."
2,Dog loves it...utterly craptastic quality.,"Well, my 9 month old GSD has an obsession with a fuzzy stuffed soccer ball she ""stole"" from my smaller dogs...she plays with it all the time yet has never even chewed a hole in it. She is NOT an aggressive chewer at all, her toys last a loooonnnngggg time. Well, she loves playing with this ball but she ripped off the soccer etched shapes in no time flat. Total waste of money for a ""sturdy"" toy labeled as ""tuff"" when it is clearly not..."
2,Fun but not very durable,"My 60 lb pit lab mix took about 3 minutes to tear a hole in this ball, pretty disappointing since I was specifically looking for something durable. The hole hasn't gotten much bigger in the few days since, and he can still kind of play with it, so I guess that's positive."
4,Well balanced comfort and hope giving reading,"L.s.,I originally bought the book for myself as I was dealing with loss of family and friends in a relatively short frame of time. Once I had read through it I found myself sharing the book with others who had gone through a similar experience as I did. The words that came back to me were, comforting, hope, peace and spritual.Since then I have bought a number of books which I give away at appropiate moments.This I wanted to share with you.Kind regards,Doug"
1,Don't buy the Dome enclosure,"The dome is excessively large and cumbersome compared to the camera.The power cable and adapter that came with it largely make the 110V power useless. considering that the main reason to purchase the dome is to mount the camera outside it would have been more reasonable to have the adapter built into the actual dome itself and then wire it up with the correct power cable direct from the mains. Instead they opted for a standard household adapter with a plug.I'm very disappointed with the quality and design of this product, not up to the usual standard from Dlink.For the price I would be better buying a new camera designed specifically for outdoor use.Don't buy this product you will regret it."
5,dcs-70,"great price at $150.00 normaly found for $300.00 installed on corner of my building using bracket I made myself, from pictures of factory brackets. I installed outlets in the ceiling for 120 volts and cat 5 wire and ran lines through the wall to the brackets housing very well made and easy to work with. I have not used in below zero degee's yet, but they work great in high wind and wet conditions and do not fog up!"
2,D Link outdoor enclosure,"This is the second D Link Camera Dome type Outdoor enclosure I purchased. The first I had no problem with at all. The Second would not close at all. I called D Link and did not get any help at all, just to tell me I wouldn't be getting my money back from them.I spent over two hours on the phone trying to get some assistance.Normally D Link is very helpful, but this time not at all. It will make me very leary about purchasing D link in the future. By the way, I fixed the problem myself with my own tools."
3,DCS-70,I have had this enclosure for about a year. It is designed for professional use and is solidly built. My one caution is to mount it to a solid structure that will not move in the wind. Any excessive movement causes the D-link cameras to eventually loose their orientation requiring them to have a power down and reset. Mount it to a solid structure and it works perfectly.
5,enlighting,After 29yrs of reading different books this provided me with a wealth of information of how and were it all begain.
4,Outstanding Visual Design,"This is not my favorite Wagnerian opera by a long shot. But it is a must own, for the simple reason that these are absolutely the best set designs ever done. The Venusberg scene is dazzlingly Bosch-ish, the entry into Wartburg looks like it stepped out of an Italian Early Renaissance fresco. A must own."
2,The Most Important Thing You Need To Know About This DVD...,"...is that there are voices heard mumbling throughout the second half...as if the sound engineers accidentally put a live microphone next to the snack bar in the lobby. I'm not kidding. The first few times you hear it, you'll think ""Hmmm...that's strange."" But after it's been going on for 20 minutes, then 30, you'll realize that you wasted your money.I've noticed that, in general, sound engineers in orchestral music are SADLY lacking in comparision to pop music producers. I've become inured with these ridiculous flaws in my own Wagner collection, what with the frequent mysterious noises and sloppy edits in even the best renditions of his operas. Where's George Martin when we need him?!?It's an incredible shame too, because the performances in this particular version are great."
1,Damn - Two Disc #2's,"My wife and I have tickets to the Tannhauser Opera this Sunday at the LA Music Center. To prepare, we opened this DVD and were surprised to find TWO of the #2 DVDs and (of course) NO #1 DVDs.Damn.I ordered another copy of this set. Hopefully that one will have TWO #1 DVDs so I will have matching sets.Otherwise Acts II and III appear to be a fine production. The NY Metropolitan Opera really gets it ""Right."""
5,"Hear the PodioBook, too...","The reissue of this work on [...] is astounding. Tracy's natural ability of storytelling shows through in the audio production of this work. He and his wife do a great job voicing the differenct characters, and the production quality of the work is a-ma-zing...Great Stuff."
2,"Bad Science, OK Fiction","If you prefer hard science Sci-Fi, avoid this book. The difficulty in writing Sci-Fi set in the near future is maintaining a sense of believability. Unfortunately, the science as set forth in this novel is sadly deficient. Even if the technologigal geegaws set forth in this book were invented in late 1996 (the book was printed in May, 1996) it is implausible that they would have totally replaced the former infrastructure by 2010 (the year in which the main events occur).However, this Sci-Fi book is more interested in the story than the technical geegaws. Within the technological framework given, the story, although treacly and predictable, is enjoyable as a borrow once from the library book. I would not recommend purchase of it tho."
2,Not worth the time,"Having never read any of Tracy Hickman's work before, I opened my copy of The Immortals hoping to find taut, mature science fiction - the cover does brag that he is a ""NY Times Best Selling Author"" after all. Instead, I got a slapdash attempt to be politically correct (look! I like gay people! I really really like gay people!), literarily descriptive (start playing a drinking game with the number of references to eye color), and intellectually beyond the confines of 'mere' religion (The one bad guy calls himself ""Reverend,"" the other spouts a sort of doomsday social Darwinism).Given that this book was written in 1996, I'll cut him some slack for rehashing such tired tropes. But even so, the writing is generally uneven, moving from clever bits of description to overly maudlin efforts to poke at the reader's tear ducts, and he can't seem to figure out how to work exposition seamlessly into the rest of the story. There is much better science fiction than this."
2,Agenda Driven,"For me this book was too slow, ponderous, and dark. There is some kind of agenda issue here of trying to portray gays as being discriminated against in this dark world. I think it was overdrawn and overblown, and not a reflection of the world as it really is."
3,Browse before buying....,"This, like it's companion book, Image Effects, is a basic Photoshop 'cookbook. There is little explanation other than the step-by-step instructions. If you like the images and effects then it's the book for you. Personally, I feel it's a bit pricey for what you get, but if it holds value for you, and will be worth the time saved."
4,The Scoundrel is worth your time!,"This was the first book I had ever read by Ann Carberry and I will now be looking for more of her works. I was hooked from the first page of The Scoundrel. The love story between Alexander and Kit was told very realistically (not the usual woman loves man but has no idea why and he treats her terribly, etc.) and progressed well. I also enjoyed the baby (Rose) in the story. There is also a nice secondary love story involved. There isn't a typical ""villain"" in the book trying to keep them apart except for a housekeeper who doesn't take up an inordinate amount of the storyline which is also a nice change of pace for a romance novel. The only thing about this book I didn't care for was that the ending seemed rather abrupt to me. I like to ""see"" a little more of the characters after they declare their love for one another. Otherwise, I would have probably given this book 5 stars although like I said in the title, it's still definitely worth your time."
5,Great Yoga Series!,I went to one of the Chopra Center's retreats and was able to attend a couple of Claire's classes in person. She is incredible! I have purchased and love all three DVDs. The music and backdrop make this video a great experience. I wish she would make more!
2,not for oil colors,i didnt like this book. its all about acrylics. it doesnt go into oils. i purchased it because it a basic to sharpen artist skills but it didnt really help me
5,Clear text and beautiful color works of art.,"This little book is a gem for all who are interested in art and paintings,with clear and concise instruction showing color and paintings in gradual progression to the finished product. This artist/author/teacher has integrity in all aspects, and it shows.I've seen Steve Allrich's beautiful paintings in a gallery on Cape Cod and I can attest to his wondrous results."
2,a bit disappointed,I should have listened to the other reviews. The images are yellow toned and it makes it very difficult for a beginner to learn how to mix paint and get the right colors. The book also doesn't guide you on this matter which makes all the difference. I haven't used this book once.
1,many good tips,This book is written by an artist that has a lot of obvious talent and ability which is always a good start for how-to-paint books! His approach to colour particularly sticks in the mind. There are no complete step-by-step demonstations (beginning to end mapped out)- but many snapshots of some of the processes and some of the stages he arrived at before the finished product. Particularly useful for artists interested in landscapes and alla prima. I would recommend this as a book which complements an artist's personal tuition program - but not a book for complete beginners I wouldn't think.
2,so so book,I read this and found only some info helpful. For a beginner this wasn't what I was looking for.
2,Disappointed,Pictures are so yellow/gold that you can't get the full benefit of any instruction/information being given. Very disappointed. Would not recommend.
4,Worthwhile,"I do not have access to a good oil painting class for beginners. I have only done two exercises so far, but I like the lessons and it seems like it will give me a good foundation to build apon."
2,over view of this book from the serious beginner.,"This little book really surprised me in its depth of knowledge. Its not for the first time painter, its more geared towards the artist who has been painting a while and understands the art concepts.All its tips, need to be put into practice, and refered to when needed.Its one of those books thats easy to follow only if taken in bite size chunks."
2,"A small book, a big disappointment...","Either the printing of this book is so bad that it makes the colors look dull, ""orangy"" and dark, or does Mr Allrich paints this way? Anyhow I am returning this book for lack of inspiring me or teaching me anything really valuable. The paintings as well as the writing are dull... It looks to me as if Mr Allrich had concocted a book to exhibit his work with here and there some information and tips. Very disappointing."
1,one color scheme,"As you flip through the pages, you will see only yellows and begin to feel overwhelmed or depressed at the lack of color. One color scheme should not be used to teach beginners, as they may want to explore the world of color."
2,GARBAGE,"THIS WAS SOME STALE A$$ CRAP, VERY UN INTERESTING, AND REDUNDANT LYRICS, A COUPLE OF BEATS WERE OK, BUT THAT WAS IT.LYRICALLY THESE GUYS JUST CAN'T BRING IT, AND THEY'VE BEEN AROUND FOR SOME TIME NOW. THE BEATS DIDN'T REALLY KNOCK AS HARD AS I THOUGHT THEY SHOULD'VE, LETS FACE IT RAP FROM THE SOUTH IS USUSALLY KNOWN FOR ITS HARD BASS, AND BAD FLOW, AND LYRICS, BUT THIS ONE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE HARD BASS, IT WAS KIND OF DISAPPOINTING. STRAIGHT BOO BOO"
3,Less attractive than their other recordings,"The Texas Torenados are a super group, no doubt, and the essence ofconjunto tex-mex music. Most of their CD's deserve and have been given'5 stars by me but this one is less attractive excluding the two solosongs by Freddy Fender ""Tus Mentiras"" and ""Trying"" which are great greatgreat recordings and are worth the purchase of this CD. This guy was sucha wonderful artist both in English and Spanish that still today I keepon purchasing all that's still coming out on the market both on CD andDVD."
5,great music,"its good music to listen too and dance, which I hav'nt done in awhile. I have listened to Feddy Fender along time ago and with this group I think there great. I have listen to other latin music, but I guess I'm the old fashion type, I grew up listening to my parents music, like the old country western as well. I like that better than the new groups. Besides I like all types of music."
3,Arrogance in Abundance,"I would have enjoyed this book a lot more if it had been strictly about Boudica. However, every other chapter was about a Roman woman or Roman general or Roman emperor. I could have done without the incestous thoughts and ways of the Romans. Lots of it was irrelevant to the story of Boudica. Boudica, in this novel, is an arrogant person. She literally bit off more than she could chew. What really did not sit well with me, throughout the entire novel, was the fact that she catered to Rome and allowed them to rape and enslave and rob her people and enjoyed immense riches UNTIL they took HER stuff. Only THEN did she want to fight for her country. Only after they raped her daughters, stole her home, and publicily whipped her, did this woman lift a finger for her people. Nevermind that what had happened to her and her children had already happened to a thousand others in her country. So it was a story of revenge, not of honor."
2,better to up-grade,Many of the tracks are incuded on Ride Like Lightening which has a stronger collection of tracks on CD1 Big Youth is sexy and has a sense of humour which is unusual. He is not as well known as he should be but a number one man among London west-indians in the 1970s.
1,This is a Bad Movie,"This is so low budget that it is embarrassing. The acting is poor,about the level of a bad High School play. The Civil Warbattle reenacting scenes are poorly done. Finally, The storyline is bad. Most of the movie story makes no sense. I paid [$] for this DVD and it wasn't worth that."
5,Should not be compared to...,"Ok .. It is not ""Gone With The Wind"" or ""Gods and Generals"" What it is a ""5 Star Amateur Effort"" on a Civil War Story with no 6 or 7 figure actors. It utilizes Civil War reenactment footage and some good photography.."
1,Not even remotely what is pictured.,"The hangers I received look nothing like whats in the picture. They are merely a length of 3/8 rod with a squared hook on one end. They'll work, but they aren't what I thought I was ordering, I'm severely disappointed in the misrepresentation, it's not like Amazon at all."
1,wrong item pictured!,"I recieved a different item not as pictured, beware, its not worth the cost to reurn."
4,Fun Romp Through Bisexual Erotica,"I was introduced to this book two months ago by a lady friend I was visiting in Portland, Oregon. In fact, she asked me to read her one of the book's stories as we made love. Even though I may be totally straight, I loved the fun and intriguing stories in this book. It almost makes me wish I was bisexual, with all the rich, exotic, and at times playful scenarios contained within the book's collection of stories.Stories like ""First Hello,"" ""Pissing In the Men's Room,"" ""Sauce For The Gender,"" and ""Anal."" The stories present a very affirming view of bisexuality. The characters in these stories for the most part are out to have fun and have some extra variety in their lives.The more erotica I read, the more I realize is isn't just about the ol ""bump and grind,"" but also about the character's lives, feelings, predicaments and how they all fit together to make a story sing. These stories are alive and vibrant and might just put a song in your heart too."
3,Consistently good but rarely great,"3 1/2Fun, eclectic electro set mixes dancefloor savvy and headphone subtlety with a degree of finesse similar acts do not comprehend. Exotic sampling and crisp beats hopefully weave into something greater with some of these nine tracks."
5,Bonobo - Dial 'M' For Monkey,"Bonobo delivers another album of outstanding downtempo. The opening track on DIAL 'M' FOR MONKEY, ""Noctuary,"" maintains the delicate melodies of ANIMAL MAGIC, while ""Flutter"" brightens the mood with a sitar and bells. The rhythms here, for the most part, are mellow and nicely syncopated to maintain listener interest. Listen to how the funky beat of ""Change Down"" drops out at the end to lift the track into pure bliss or how the zither loop at the start of ""Wayward Bob"" leads both to a calming jazz and to an urgent mystery. ""Pick Up"" keeps the tempo up, even as the short but beautiful ""Something for Windy"" whistles itself into the ether. ""Nothing Owed"" whips itself up into a guitar and saxophone wonderland, and ""Light Pattern"" ends the album in that same vein. Forget dialing ""M""; dial ""B"" for Bonobo!"
5,Interesting journey into the twisted mind of Arthur Rimbaud.,"A book for anyone who enjoys good writing. Filled with life and fantastic imagery, the only thing lacking in this collection are the original versions in French. Other than that, the translations are excellent, so much that one forgets that the poems were originally written in another langauge."
4,The Rebel And the Muse,"Rimbaud at 14 years of age mastered Latin poetry! Although he was an extraordinary genius, he rebelled against family and society almost blindly. Having taken to be sacred the derangement of the senses, he ventured into a hallucinatory world where he tried to give the ineffable a descriptive voice. Thus his theory of ""pure poetry"". Rimbaud eventually gave up on writing verse, and became an explorer of some renown. He returned to France to die in his late 30's. Arthur Rimbaud: Complete Works at least contains the original French texts, and the English translations are excellent. The latter portion of this remarkable book deals mainly with Rimbaud's letters to several people, including Verlaine. And while Verlaine eventually made peace with himself, unfortunately Rimbaud did not. On his gravestone is written simply the words: ""Pray For Him""."
5,Great Poetry...A Classic Book,"An essential book that collects all of Rimbaud's poetry. I thoroughly enjoyed reading each poem and would like to thank Mr.Schdmit for translating the French text to English for those of us who don't speak the language of love. I believe this book contains all of his classic poems, prose and letters that the legendary and doomed poet wrote during his brief literary career. A wonderful book for all lovers of great poetry and for admirers of Rimbaud's uncompromising, daring and original style."
2,Beware! Creative translator at work!,"Highly unreliable. Schmidt has produced some very good English-language poetry, but it ain't Rimbaud. He conceals this by not printing the original on a facing page. Worse yet, he prints the Illuminations as free verse, when they were written as prose poems (on the rationale that the prose poem isn't as successful a genre in English as it is in French.) I am sternly against this kind of translation, unless you're going to go all the way and admit that what you're doing is a poem by Paul Schmidt ""after"" Rimbaud. But he doesn't. Rimbaud newbies are directed instead to Louise Varese's superb versions of Illuminations and A Season in Hell; those who want a complete works should go for Wallace Fowlie's less memorable but more faithful edition; total Rimbaud freaks should learn French (and mortgage the house in order to be able to afford the magnificent Pleiade edition of the originals)."
2,"No longer necessary, if it ever was","I wrote an earlier review of this edition of Rimbaud back when I called myself lexo-2; I'd now amend it, if I could, to say that the only translations of Rimbaud that non-French speakers are going to need is Wyatt Mason's superb bilingual edition in two volumes for the Modern Library. Schmidt has a lovely turn of phrase, but this is really a collection of poems by Paul Schmidt inspired by the work of Rimbaud, and not in my view a translation at all."
3,Crisp short stories,"Gao Xingjian uses small events occurring in daily life such as the visit of a decaying temple by a young couple, a road accident involving a father and a his young child, a swimmer suffering from a sudden pain or conversation in a park to deal with topics which he cherishes: the lost innocence of youth, the quest for an environment ruined by modern architecture or the nostalgia for a lost tenderness that only a father or grandfather could provide. Often there is no plot in those short stories, but a simple succession of images, impressions, dreams and thoughts. An author well worth discovering."
4,Buy this somewhere else!,"First off, the price is outrageous! Don't buy through Amazon. You can find this through Tonevendor.com or Parasol.com at much more reasonable prices. I think this is a great album but it is not as cohesive in the 'album' sense as 'This is Beaumont', the groups first album. Some very good tracks, very chill music. Imagine yourself riding around on a Vespa scooter in Italy circa 1968! Great stuff!"
2,"Works, but very noisy","I've used one of these to raise and lower our 17' skiboat for over 15 years. It worked reliably, but I recently replaced it with a Warn 110v winch after reading that the Warn winch was much quieter. They were right. The Superwinch almost required one to wear earplugs."
5,superwinch,"I use this winch to pull a converted cart up a steep grade, Great when I have to haul firewood."
3,Crimson Mountain,"This book is okay, but it's not one of my favorite Grace Livingston Hill books. Quite a lot of eliminating economic ""class"" within the story."
3,Not what I expected but is okay,Too much chit chat and not enough production methods. I am opening a dairy and I need more of the hard process not history.
5,Rookie Shirley Horn Fan!,"I must say I'm probably not the one to ask a serious question about the style, previous recordings, classic hits, or anything for the matter about Shirley Horn. After reading the other reviews, I thought I'm truly out of my leauge, then I realized there are people who may not have ever even heard of Shirley ( I hadn't b4 purchasing this c.d) and so my insight is going to be different, but hopefully helpful. I was thoroughly impressed by the entire recording. She's a flawless singer, yes her voice is flawless, and sexy, and rich, hauntingly beautiful. I listen to the whole C.D over, and over they're all my favorite. I don't have anything previous to compare it to. The other reviews just make me want to buy more Shirley Horn music, which i'm going to do right away!"
5,Vocal and dramatic mastery,"This DVD is a testament to the artistry of Sherrill Milnes. He is vocally stunning, as well as dramatically dominating. The expression on his face as the curtain falls on the Council Chamber scene is intense. The other singers are good as well, although there are a few places where the tenor has some pitch problems. The reviewer below had a pretty accurate discription of the other stars. The father-daughter duet is marvelous and Milnes' pianissimo is emotional. The production is visually strong and thankfully faithful. Anyone who loves this work will want this, but those unfamiliar are encouraged to try it as well, especially if Verdi appeals to them. Dana Hill"
3,Letters from Cassandra - 3+,"Maigret receives an anonymous letter predicting a violent crime. The letter is tracked back to the home of a prominent, if idiosyncratic, Parisian lawyer, who lives in and works from a huge luxury apartment with his high-strung wife, two children, devoted secretary and staff of several. After an initial visit to the lawyer, Maigret concludes that there is plausible threat--but by whom? to whom? and why? Ultimately, the threat becomes a reality and the sorting becomes more serious.I enjoyed the novella--the portrayal of characters is first-rate, as always--but the subtlety (or vagueness) of the storyline seemed overdone at times. The focus on the psychological state of the characters and their interactions necessarily slows the action down, but maybe a tad too much with ""Maigret Hesitates"". Still, the book had plenty of good moments and is worth a reader's time and attention."
3,Doesnt work with Playtex,Do not buy these if your looking for a replacement for the playtex inserts. Will not fit.
3,dated but still worthwhile,"while eno's best works sound as if they could have been made today, or even 20 years from now, a majority of this album has a definite 80s electronica sound. i understand electronica is now somewhat a derogatory term, and pulling from this genre does not help the albums cause. however, there are some good songs on here, and 1 or 2 gems that no Eno fan should miss out on. also, i find this album a good diversion from the majority of music in my library.Recommended."
4,kiss my moby,"Better than I remember .Ali Click was the groove that caught my ear,but the album as a whole deserves a listen.3 1/2 to 4 stars."
4,"not bad, but please release the original ""My Squelchy Life""","""Nerve Net"" was an lp that wasn't until very late in the game, when Eno got cold feet and didn't release his original offering, ""My Squelchy Life."" (Please, Brian, release it)This lp took many many listenings for me to finally come to terms with it, and many more before I realized that I was really enjoying it. His mixes of funk with electronica a la the Orb (and others who have used Eno as a blueprint to make their music) are nice listening, and leads me to wonder if Eno will release a full-on electronica lp of some of his tracks...hmmmmVery different listening than most of his lps (""Spinner"" comes closest to this effort, in many ways), this lp nonetheless has wonderful moments on it and Eno fans should give it a spin."
4,Sounds from a water bubble,"I have this cd for about ten years now and I still really like it. Mr Eno is the master of his unique sound, and he is very consistent in how to use it. On ""Nerve Net"" everything seems slightly warped and out-of-tune, yet ethereal, an ideal soundtrack for nighttime listening. Don't fall asleep though, some songs may lead to accidents - ""What actually happened"" brings on the feel of a harrowing rollercoaster ride through a dark and scary forest; ""Juju Space Jazz"" sounds like recorded on a boat rolling haplessly in the sea and may actually induce symptoms of seasickness, and the groove of ""Ali Click"" could lead to compulsive dancing. My only reservation is that some songs draw out a little, but this depends on the daily mood of the listener."
3,Clay Pot Painting- need experience,Book is great. Lots of fun ideas. Need some previous painting knowledge and a steady hand.
5,Awesome book!,"My kids loved this book about the underground railroad. The pictures are very inviting and well done. Even though, this book is long, my kids were involved the whole way through."
4,The Spider-Man short,"While the Wolverine & Venom story is the lead piece, and a fine part of a larger story by Sam Kieth, I myself wrote the Spider-Man story here. This is purely a story for fans: the concept was to take every idea that was now a Spider-Man cliche and put 'em in one story. Without giving away too much, the punchline to it all was to have a Steve Ditko drawing of ol' Pete, but that and a few other things were altered by the asst. ed. Ah well. Can't win 'em all. It's still a fun story for any serious Spidey fan...if I do say so myself."
1,the fox,"I was very unhappy with the quality of the book. It was more like a pamphlet and an odd shape that was difficult to hold and read. There was no information such as the year it was written, anything about the author.Just a thin folder with printed pages inside. Plus it was expensive for what I got."
2,Disappointed,"The book's dimensions are smaller than one would expect for a photography style book (shame on me for not paying closer attention). If you are looking for ""inspiration"" in styling this might be your book, but it contains no information on how effects were achieved and there are a good portion of the images that are obviously digitally manipulated to get additional effects. This is not the semi-educational guide to extremely creative make-up artistry that I was looking for."
3,3 Star historical rewrite,"This video has been in my own collection for several years now. It inspired me to do my own extensive research into the Graham case. The movie leaves out so many details which are damning to Ms. Graham (Wood). It became clear to me that since the movie was produced three years after her execution that someone wanted to change public opinion regarding the Monohan murder. Graham was not a victim, she was an amoral opportunist who got caught with her pants down (quite literally). I am against the death penalty personally; however, Susan Hayward's performance didn't reenforce by beliefs. She growled more than she spoke and her receipt of the Academy Award for this picture astounds me still. This is a good period crime (circa late '50's) B&W drama, but do not take it factually to heart. Except for the reality of some of the execution details (which will cause nightmares) it's meant to tug at your heart strings and to demonstrate the callousness of the system."
5,I saw the original movie with Susan Heyward in it.,"I saw this movie about 8 times,I can't get enough of it. This was a real tear-jerker.It was very sad but very touching.I did't like the ending as it made me cry like a baby, I mean really cry!!"
4,Story of Redemption,"If you want an anti-death penalty movie, rent ""Dead Man Walking."" This movie works best as a story of how Barbara Graham's heart and attitude changes as she approaches her execution. Susan Hayward's best performances come when she's at her sluttiest before her arrest and as she's waiting for her execution. Her hystrionic level when she's put in the slammer gets a little too high. She's best when she tones herself down. I bought the movie, for keeps around the time of McVeigh's execution, but I'm still hesitant to watch it again for a while. It cut too close to what was going on in real life."
3,Was I Ever Surprised!,"Well, I knew that this was about a gal on Death Row, but I kept thinking she'd get her pardon from the Governor--no dice! Other reviewers seem to know a lot about the real woman on whom this Susan Hayward character is based. Evidently, it was quite clear she was a murderess. The same reviewers say things like, Susan walks away with the picture. Well, how could she not? There's nobody else particularly outstanding in the film, and because of that partly, and partly because the character kept causing her own problems, I didn't care for this movie. It was quite depressing. So, if that's where you're coming from, I guess you'd like it. I Want to See Something Else next time."
3,Doesn't Live Up To Its Reputation,"This is a terrific script with a sound argument against the death penalty especially where there is room for doubt as to the person's guilt. For me, the film's major flaw is Susan Hayward. She plays it from her throat and not from inside herself. I was astounded as to how forced her performance was especially knowing that she won the Oscar for it. I wanted to like this otherwise well scripted and filmed movie, but I just can't get passed that performance."
1,A mistake,I believe I ordered a DVD from region 2 by mistake. It was bought on Amazon from a popular movie business located in the United States. It said nothing about being from region 2 on the web page I was looking at when I placed it in my cart and then ordered it. However after viewing my order I seen wear it states that is a region 2 DVD that will not play on american DVD players. Buyers be aware of this. To avoid any further confusion I will not order any more DVDs from amazon or the seller I purchased this from.
1,Are these safe to eat out of?,"ReceiSango Splash Onion Soup Bowls, Set of 4ved them in the mail today, although intact,these bowls are porous, and from China and I question the safety. Also they look too thin to be ovenproof. Very disappointed, I will be returning them."
5,Beautiful bowls / great value,"I have the mixing bowls and soup bowls -- yes they are 'partially glazed' and that is their charm. Rustic, casual and beautiful.And they go in the microwave or the dishwasher. I love them."
2,Broken soup bowl - poor packaging,"Received soup bowls yesterday, very poorly packed, with only one piece of packing paper separating them from each other. Therefore, one was completely broken and now must be sent back. Also, ordered ""onion"" soup bowls assuming they could go in the oven to melt the cheese on top of the soup - this is what you do with an ""onion"" soup bowl - only to find they are not ovenproof. Very disappointed with Amazon!"
5,"One of those ""must have"" cookbooks","We've had our copy now since 1971 and it's completely fallen apart (we hold it together with rubber bands when it's not in use. Several of our favorite family recipes are in here (apple crunch in particular).If you like good food and enjoy cooking, this is the book to have. It MUST be reissued!"
3,New York Times Natural Foods Cookbook,"I think this book, quite old now, was over rated. The recipes are confusing and the ingredients hard to find."
5,The New York Times Natural Foods Cookbook,Very prompt delivery! My husband loves the book. The condition of the book was exactly as the seller described. Thanks so much!Kathie
4,"Gorey Was Odd, Brilliant And Wildly Creative","I did not even know who Edward Gorey was until last month. While we were vacationing on Cape Cod, my wife spied The Edward Gorey House as we were driving on 6A and said ""let's turn around check that out."" His house was quite ""peculiar"" and his closest living male relative Kenny (mentioned in this book) gave us a tour. Gorey certainly was odd, brilliant and wildly creative and this absolutely comes through in this book of interviews with him. If you know nothing about Gorey, this book will cover his life and art for you. If you know Gorey, the book will fill in some gaps. One caution, the book gets repetitive as Gorey essentially tells parts of his life story over and again - how can celebrities put up with the same questions over and over?"
1,These wipes remove nail polish!,"It seems to me that these wipes did indeed keep me from burning, but something is wrong with these wipes! They removed my nail polish completely and also caused the black paint to come off my umbrella handle and smear everywhere. I don't know what they put in these wipes because normal sunscreen does not remove nail polish!"
2,"2 Bottles, No Change...","Used 2 bottles thus far on a pee soiled rug from our dog. It has done nothing so far. The fine print of the bottle says to allow drying for 2 weeks by the way. Guess those enzymes have to take their time! Well, it's been 2 weeks after our first application and we have had no change to the odor. We are going to apply 2 more bottles just for the fun of it.They offer a money back guarantee, so, if they actually send me my money back I will rate them much higher. Await my update to this review about if I actually get any money back or not!"
3,I don't know,"This odor remover seems ok, but it hasn't struck me as a cure for pet odor by any means. I've followed the instructions, saturating our dog stains. Maybe, as one reviewer suggested, it doesn't work as well in humid climate? It does seeem to remove most of the smell, but the spot never seems completely renewed, even after repeated uses of the course of a week. Still, better then most chemically laden carpet stain removers I've tried before - so I'm appreciative of that aspect."
5,Natures Miracle,"There was a terrible smell coming out of the grout in our bathroom. We tried tons of cleaning supplies to no avail and started to think that the grout had to be removed and redone.However, Through the internet, we heard about Natures Miracle. I have to say, it truly is a Miracle. We focused on the grout only, scrubbed it with Natures Miracle, let it sit overnight and Voila.The smell dissappeared. I'm so glad we found out about this product. I would recomend it to everyone.Iris"
5,The only pet odor remover that works!,"If you use this product as directed it works very well on all pet urine odors. The one downfall is if you have tried to get out the odor or stain w/ another pet odor product, Nature's Miracle may not work. So make sure you try this one first!"
5,No more Pee,Love this stuff. It cleans the floors and laundry from my dogs urine smells and keeps him from peeing on the same stuff again. he is now 95% house trained @ only 4 months
2,Didn't work for us on the odor of an older stain.,"We've tried several products and had high hopes for this one but it didn't work as well as we hoped. Our carpet is dark in color so there was no urine stain, but an odor was noticeable. For the first day or two the product worked on the odor, but it eventually come back. Maybe if the stain was fresher it would work better."
2,Didn't help,"My dog was VERY sick a few weeks ago and after all the vomit and its stains were cleaned up from my bedroom carpet, I noticed a few days later there was still a rankness lingering in my room. I searched online and found this, got it super quick in the mail and immediately went into my room, used up the entire bottle, scrubbed it in my carpet and let it dry. The smell of the product was a certain alcohol smell, and wasn't terrible although I wouldnt say it was a ""good"" smell. The next day I was excited and thought it was better because it seemed fresher overall, but then 2 days in after that the exact same smell is back. I would not waste time using this product again to treat carpet odor."
1,useless,"Despite my worst fears, I have a kitty urinator. After lots of review reading and the reccommendation of my pet store owner, I bought a gallon of Nature's Miracle. When I didn't see results at first, I ripped up my carpet and cut out the soiled part of my carpet pad thinking that must be the reason I was still smelling urine. After using the entire gallon of nature's miracle on my carpet, I still have a house that smells like urine and (thanks to N.M) now rubbing alcohol.I'm going to give NOK-OUT a try now, I guess. What a waste of money."
2,Doesn't work for set-in perspiration stains,I have a racing pit crew shirt that I unfortunately neglected for a while and there were some set-in perspiration stains in it. I read that enzymatic cleaners work well for this and this product seemed to get decent reviews so I gave it a try. I soaked the areas in question for 5-10 minutes a few times and put the shirt in the laundry but the stains are still there. It may work for pet odors/stains but doesn't seem to work well for perspiration.
3,Black Light Still Shows Stains,"I used a black light to find cat urine stains. I tested this product on a small area of stains and really soaked it good. After blotting it up, and even after a follow up carpet shampoo, I could still see the stains with the black light. Smell is gone, and it looks fine, but the black light still shows the stains.P.S. - Never buy a black light."
1,Used gallons. Doesn't work,"I've literally used gallons of this stuff. And the urine smell remains. Strong. I soaked the carpet, the pad, and very likely the subfloor. Still stinks of dog urine, 4 weeks and $55 later. Sigh."
1,This product is terrible!,"I came home from a weekend away to find that my house sitter hadn't done a good job and there was a dog pee puddle dried in the guest bedroom. I used the carpet cleaner with water to moisten the stain and suck up what I could, and then tried Nature's Miracle. Ugh! This made the smell awful! It's been a week since the original treatment and it's so bad no one can sleep in the room. Do NOT buy."
5,works great,I have 2 mini doxies and they will not stop peeing in the house. Nature's Miracle works but it does not stop our animals from marking the same spots. I can say that our house does not smell like urine and that is exactly what we were looking for. There are no stains on our carpet and I have not found any other product that works as well.
2,Works for a few days...,"I got this and thought it was great....got the smell out right way, but after a few days it return! I really wanted it work, but no."
5,The best one out there!,"I used this for the first time in my sister's new apartment. Supposedly, she was renting a pet and smoking free apartment. The unit we looked at was spotless. The one we walked into the day of the move-in, however, smelled horridly of cat pee. They had a so-called professional come in to shampoo the carpets but their efforts did squat for the odor. We took advantage of the apartment still being empty and rented a rug doctor to do all of the carpets ourselves. We used nature's miracle in the shampooer and, holy cow, you would not believe how awesome it works! Honestly, you would have to see the used water we were dumping out of the rug doctor. Anyways, it works like a charm! The apartement no longer stinks and I will be keeping a steady supply of this stuff for the future. It works on everything, not just pet stains!"
2,"Does not deter, only cleans","Nature's Miracle is OK for the cleanup of cat urine (spray). However, it still leaves something behind that my cat can smell, and that cat will spray there again and again. I used Nature's Miracle for several weeks because when I went to buy my usual ""Dumb Cat"", and it was out of stock at the store (with good reason). Wow, what a difference. With the Dumb Cat, the cat will never spray that area again. If you want something that works for sure, get the Dumb Cat. If you want to cheap out and don't mind repeat sprays in the area, but you'd like a short-term cleanup fix, get the Nature's Miracle. Dumb Cat Anti-Marking and Cat Spray Remover"
2,Arrived with no seal under cap and missing fluid...,"I have always bought this from a store and it has always worked great. This was shipped with packing tape over the lid and in a bag tied closed within the box to prevent spillage. But there was no product seal under the cap. When I buy it at the store there is always a seal under the cap. I noticed the fluid weighed a little on the light side. Its effectiveness is also not what I am used to, as in it does not work as well, though still works okay. I believe that either this is not the original formula, or was just outright replaced with something else, or that some of the fluid was removed and replaced with water.I do love the TRUE Nature's Miracle product, but I'm suspicious that I received something else or it was watered down. It should definitely have come with a seal under the cap. If this is why the product can be sold at this price then it needs to be in the description."
1,Does not work AT ALL,"Nature's Miracle is total crap. I bought a gallon of this stuff after my cat peed all over my clothes. I doused the clothes with this stuff, and let it hang out to dry. THREE TIMES. This had no effect whatsoever on removing the cat pee smell. It was a total waste of money. What DID work is Oxiclean from the grocery store. Save your money!"
1,Deceptive Description!,"Beware! The picture shows the Gallon size. What is sent are pint bottles. I should have paid attention to it saying 16 oz, but there is no excuse for a deceptive picture!"
1,Not good for clothes,I bought this item to remove stains from my clothes. It didn't help remove any of the grease stains that my pants had.-Unsatisfied customer
1,Worthless despite the hypw,"when i first put this on i thought hey i can't smell it anymore. well that illusion only lasted a day and the odor came back. i repeated it, letting it dry in between as directed, until the bottle was empty and it still smells. this just wasted my time."
1,"What happened to the product ""Petzyme?""","I entered Petzyme, and Nature's Miracle popped up instead. Petzyme is amazing, and it does work on feces as well as urine and blood stains. I have cleaned my light colored wool oriental rugs after my elderly dog's bloody diarrhea, hemorrages, and new puppy accidents, and they look (and smell) brand new after 10 years of life with animals. Help if you know what happened to this great product."
5,Life Saver,We have 2 Shiba Inu's and couldn't live without Nature's Miracle. It's fantastic for removing odors from accidents on carpets. I've used it in our steam cleaner for general carpet cleaning and in the laundry to wash pet bed covers. It has removed every single odor problem that we've had. We're hooked and would never even consider trying another product.
1,Carpet still smells...,"I followed the directions on the back of the bottle and used the product several times. Unfortunately, it didn't take the urine smell out of our carpets. Thinking I didn't use enough, I used more the next times, but it still didn't help. Moreover, it doesn't make sense to have to use so much of the bottle for one stain even if I didn't use enough. Wanted to love it, though."
1,totally ineffective,"Purchased the 32 oz. bottle and tried on cat urine. The wool carpet had a spot on which I'd tried everything - boiling water, soap, carpet cleaner, baking soda, vinegar. This product had no impact whatsoever."
2,Odors? yes. Stains? no,"I'm currently fostering a pit bull who marks his territory in my house when left alone for even a few minutes. Frequently I don't discover the urine until it's already dried into the carpet and I'm left with both the scent and the stain. This product works well for removing the scent/odor of urine, but it definitely doesn't remove the stain. Thankfully a friend of mine who owns a consignment store another product, Kleen Warrior (sold door to door) that lifts the urine stain overnight.Bottom line: Have urine odors? This will work for you! Have stains? Find a different product."
1,"Didn't work for cat urine, expensive","Our Little Man cat decided he wasn't using the litter box for a while, and so of course we were left with that awful smell. It says it should work on even old stains and smells, so we bought a gallon of this (one of the most expensive ones I saw at the pet store) and poured it on the spot.It smells horrible while it's ""working."" We live in a very small apartment so the stink of the solution was almost unbearable. And after all that, the old smell is still clearly there. I mean that you can still tell where he went, even if you are standing above it, let alone if you knelt down and put your head there.Doesn't work on old cat urine, save your money."
5,There is no equivalent...,"This product is fabulous for any type of material or flooring needing stain and odor removing. I am so pleased with this for my puppy housebreaking work, I went and got their scented dog pads and potty spray. Great value and quality."
2,Stain and Odor Remover,"It claims to remove Stain and Odor and it does not remove stains. Whether it removes odors, I didn't really pay it any attention. I followed the instructions to the letter and it still didn't remove the stain from my hardwood floor."
5,Nature's Miracle,I have used this product for long time since I have two cats.I'm glad that could get with great price offer.
2,Best Product,"The best product to remove pet odors and stains is PLAIN WHITE VINEGAR and water. Don't waste your money. Owned a pet shop, vinegar neutralizes all pet odors, musty smelling clothes, put it in your laundry to freshen clothes and it won't harm material like bleach does."
1,natures miracle,I have tried this product and it does not work. I have several dogs and bought this product at the pet store and it was a waste of money
1,Just like any other miracle...,"...if you have enough faith, you'll believe it works.Unfortunately, it didn't work on de-odorizing a single dog, one-time-urination spot. I used the entire container, and let it sit for a week.The product is mostly alcohol, so it's no surprise that it didn't break down the urea in the urine.Science."
3,"Great Product, But....","We've been buying this at a local pet supplies shop. It really does work very well, but you have to use a lot of it, and it isn't cheap. I would rate this much higher, if it wasn't so damned expensive. If you don't need it as often, and as much, as we do, I recommend that you try it."
3,Great For Odor Removal - Not So Much On Stains,"We are renters with a dog and there are times when accidents happen. We use Woolite Deep to fight the stain (excellent) then use this to deodorize the area. This advice was given to us by a worker for Stanley Steam Cleaner and it has been a great one-two-punch on getting the carpet clean and scent free. Bonus, the products don't damage the carpet or leave an irritating residue like Resolve (every steam cleaner we have met laments on their hatred of Resolve because it makes it difficult for them to get the dirt out of the carpet)."
5,The best,"This regular ""standard"" Nature's Miracle is the best. Been using it and recommending it (I'm a dog trainer) for a LOT of years. Works beautifully. Recently tried the special ""urine destroyer"" formulation and I'd STRONGLY suggest staying with this one - the original. Got a pup, an older dog, or even a child just learning to be toilet trained and ""forgetting"" sometimes, Nature's Miracle is for you. Great stuff."
1,doesn't fit,"I bought these for my 77 ironhead Sportster. When I tried to install them they didn't fit. I'm very unhappy with this purchase. Also, they are very flimsy. The housing distorts when you try to twist the light into the socket."
1,"Fit perfect, works horrible.....","I bought these with the thought of using less energy in my Land Cruiser. They fit perfectly in the socket and did light up. I noticed right away these were not as bright as the stock bulbs. In fact, they were about 50 percent dimmer. I decided to live with this since they used less energy. Then, after only a couple months of use they began to fail. Some of the LED's would no longer light up while others would randomly blink. These are poorly made, cheap products......don't buy them!"
3,easy on the ears,"A good soundtrack, not spectacular. It dosen't hold it's own once removed from the movie, but all the tracks are well written and performed but better when in the movie."
5,book,"purchased this for a friend who was doing researcvh for a paper he was writing and he said the book arrived in good condition, in a timely manner after purchasing and gave him a lot fo useful information for his research."
5,10 Stars,"This book is wonderful and easy to use. The ideas really work. I started using them with my class and saw results with the first lesson. The kernel essay has made my bad writers good. This is a must for all writing teachers. If you get a chance to attend her workshop, do it. It was money and time well spent. She even emails you back when you ask questions. Check out her web site: [...]Buy this book."
3,Disappointed,"While the concept of releasing students from the tyranny of the five-paragraph essay is to be applauded, the book itself was disappointing. In general, the models included are awkward and undeveloped--they have the feel of rough drafts--definitely not ones I would use as mentor texts in helping my students create their own pieces. The bulk of the book is models like these and repetitive tips for how to lead kids through guided writing and kernel essays. Perhaps I'll find it in a library some day to grab an idea or two, but I don't need it as a ready reference in my home library."
5,generally fabulous enjoyment,"I am NOT one of the music experts who do reviews. ALL selections on this CD are INTERESTING and ENJOYABLE, without any noxious noise excursions for shock value that some artists think are necessary somewhere in their collection."
2,No great news and too much truth,"The new Werewolf saga has no great news than the new st system.If VtR rewrite the entire vampire beliefs and erased the truths - Point for it! (nobody gets benefit from weird legends acting as truth)In the other hand WWtF just renamed the same things... and just changed the tribes number and name (to wrost, since there are 5 tribes and moon auspices with the SAME definition).The point for the book is the new definition of the spiritual world and ""the hosts"".Who expect news shouldn buy it."
1,Werewolf the Forsaken = WTF = What The F@%k,"Seriously WTF says it all. White Wolf will definetly go under in about 2 years if they don't ever re-release the old system. Here is a message for White Wolf, taking out the point of Werewolf (the apocolypse, the wyrm) and leaving them just standing around with there claws up there butts then I might as well play a werewolf in d20 modern. Honestly, give me WtA or give me White Wolf's death."
4,A much-needed update,"With Werewolf: the Forsaken, White Wolf has revamped (pun intended) the Werewolf system. It is now a game that will appeal to a much wider audience. Honestly, until I read this book, Werewolf was the one White Wolf game I refused to play. The previous rules were *terrible*. The new rules of course build off of the World of Darkness core rules, and are in some ways similar to the rules for Vampire: the Requiem. One advantage of this similarity is that when vampires and werewolves meet, there might not be so much frantic searching for the rules that govern a contest of Gifts versus Disciplines. If you were in any way interested in the previous Werewolf system, this update will be a revelation. If you're new to White Wolf, while Vampire is their flag-ship, Werewolf is a relatively simple and direct game with an incredible amount of potential."
3,good but not good enough,the wtf book is a good book for someone that knows nothing about the game but for someone like me that has played the game for 13 years it lacks alot....vampire will be the #1 game again for white wolf it is a much better game
2,A pale comparison to the old game.,"All of the interesting story elements of the old game have been replaced with lackluster substitutes, i.e. werewolves tribes being equivalent to fraternities or clubs. Basically this new incarnation, as I understand it, is set up to be Dungeons and Dragons with werewolves being the heroes. If I wanted to play D&D;, I would do so.The artwork is awesome. Ron Spencer. The best artist to ever draw a werewolf. That is the only redeeming quality of this book."
2,Personal Feeling,"I feel that even though this book and game may be enjoyable. It is not worth the price listed. In fact it is not worth more than $10. The information about the world of ""Werewolf: the Forsaken"" is very limited and does not go into great detail. Especially when compared to the other ""World of Darkness"" templates or other White Wolf products."
1,Not the book you're looking for,The book that was sent to me was Agripopolis by a former Argentine president. I was looking for Ariel by rodo. The book I searched for was not the book sent to me so make sure if you are looking for ariel not to get this one.
1,Way Overrated,"This book was required reading. Sadly, I fail to see why people find this to be an important text. It is a very flat read devoid of anything interesting. If you like reading incoherent dreams and delusional rambling then this is your book!"
1,Ariel,Este libro es complicadisimo de entender y si no esta dispuesto a dedicar mucho tiempo a leer y ha entender un libro de tanta complexidad y enredo no se lo recomiendo a nadie.
3,Entry Level Book,"This is an introductory book for both chemical and isotope hydrology topics. If you just want to know both topics in general, maybe this book is the right one to start. Based on the price quoted, I recommend you to get more specific books for each topic."
4,Sound great,"Easy to instal and a lot easier to clean/replace the filter then the stock. Has a great sound, you can hear the air going in... The only issue I have with it is the first bend from the intake rubs on the hood. Also with the filter at the top of the engine compartment it does not get as much cool air as would like but then this is a short ram intake not a CAI. as far as performance it is not significant by itself."
5,Great study material,"Get this book and study it. Then ask yourself if your ""knife fighting master/instructor/teacher"" is telling you the truth about reality, or is he only selling you smoke."
5,The capricious nature of commercial and critical success,"JWH is a highly skilled songwriter. He writes moving songs with smart lyrics and interesting chord progressions. His voice is reminiscent of Elvis Costello and his guitar playing is strong. His career should have achieved at least the same commercial success as M. Ward. In concert, JWH is charismatic, witty, tells great stories and cracks quite a few impromptu jokes. In short, he might have the best between-song-banter I`ve ever heard. I don't understand how he never received the acclaim he rightly deserves. See this guy in concert when he decides he's bored of writing novels.Can an album be a classic if it's nearly perfect but nobody bothered to buy it? This one is in my top 50 list but the number of people who are exposed to this work are few and far between. Who writes songs like ""Hitler's tears""? Answer--no one else."
1,Just awful,"My kids and I read the book together and loved it. Even got the audio version for a long ride to Canada. However, the movie was so bad that none of us could watch it. The acting was horrible, the plot was completely turned around and minimized, the children were completely unlikeable....I wish I could give this negative stars."
3,Video vs. Book,"My sixth graders read the book then watched the video. They seemed to enjoy the book over the movie. They felt the movie was ""too slow"" but could be because of they are so use to modern day movies.Yes, I will use it again (next school year) because it is always a ""treat"" to watch the video on a book one just read and to compare the two."
1,Sucky movie good book,One of the best books I have ever read. When I saw the movie I almost threw up. Worst movie I ever saw.
3,High price and dented cans,"I feel really ripped off by the price$5.26 a can and many reviews claiming this was the bestI ordered 2 cans, I received 2 dented up cansso I went ahead and made some chicken curry thaisoup. I found this Milk to be average in taste no difference thanother brands I have used.But the thing that really got me was when I went downto my local Asian market and found this exact same item for 1.89 a canwithout the dents...."
4,Political adversaries thrown together to free innocent man,"Defense attorney Daniel Walker wins an acquittal for his client by tricking the real culprit into confessing. After the case, power broker Calvin Stoddard vows to support Daniel's run for a seat on the state senate if the lawyer handles a legal matter for him. Daniel, realizing that Calvin's support almost insures his election, agrees. Daniel's opponent is the local librarian Lily Morgan. Five years ago Daniel painted Lily as an adulterer as he obtained a divorce for her ex-spouse. A murder occurs, and the sheriff arrests Lily's friend. Daniel decides to defend the accused. Since his own clerk is unavailable, Daniel enlists Lily as his legal clerk. As they work together to prove his client did not do the crime, they fall in love. Breathless will thrill fans of historical mysteries, and romance readers will cherish the love story between the lead protagonists."
1,"""Breathless""? Try ""Witless""!","...Daniel infuriates me with his arrogance and his high-handedness. He wrongs Lily terribly, and when he comes back to town, he feels only a twinge of pity that all the people in town ostracize her because of HIS brilliant lawyer work. Then he proceeds to boss her around mercilessly, and at one point, he handcuffs her to a post because she stages a protest. What a man! Where's the line for more romance heroes like him? Sign me up for one!!! (sarcasm intended here).Then, in the end, (what a wonderful man!) he gives up a promising political future for her. Gee. If he had walked into the library and I was Lily, I would've told him where he could shove his new library card."
3,Fun but....,"Temujin has good ideas but fails to deliver the ultimate. This is not Myst folks. Lots of snags in the game and several areas of severe frustration. There are no smooth follow-through in some scenes and this may leave you wishing for another game plan. I have gotten pretty far without a clue book but after all that work am not excited about finishing the game, something to work on?.I know I am not the first to comment in a neg. way, just wanted to add my comments. There are many ++ to this game, unfortunately also many - Once you are on the track it goes well then it craps. Again, something that requires better attention?"
5,Perfect for scenery makers and diorama makers,Good product with the right consistency for diorama makers. You can brush it on or use a spray bottle to spray it on. Holds things tight and dries clear. Perfect for applying textures to your terrain.
1,Pointless,I dont usually buy things like this but i decided to try it out for my daughters project thinking we may get a more refined final product and I just didn't see the point to this stuff. It didn't work like anyone would assume from the description. We ended up using other products and threw this away. Waste of money for us.
5,A Kick in the Pants,"Ever wonder if your life has a purpose? Ever ask yourself if you have made the best career decisions? Do you sometimes wonder if you should be zigging while your life is zagging? I suspect most of us have asked these questions, and even more so if you are reading this review! This book offers up a simple message, delivered as a kick in the pants. This is a crafty story designed to get the reader in motion, to not simply stand still - but to motivate the individual to do what's right and pursue a higher calling. Isn't that what we are all seeking? Maybe the author has found a neat way to describe how to beat the rat race, and to seek a path towards personal fulfillment - I don't know, but sure is something for all of us to shoot for. There is no time like the present to grab this book and consider implementing in your life. I did, and am looking forward to the rest of 2006 with great anticipation."
5,The Ten Secrets: A Father's Last Gift,"The Ten Secrets reminds us of what is truly important in life with a nuance that is rarely seen in literature today. A touching and thought provoking journey from start to finish. True happiness is not ""all about me"" or what we can take from the world and contrary to popular culture, life is not about how much money you make or the notoriety that you gain, it is a precious gift to be shared. The Ten Secrets awakens an awareness of the impact that a person can have on another's life, the ability to enrich the lives of those you come into contact with, and is a reminder to appreciate each fleeting moment. These simple truths have made me question and reflect on my path through life and will be a touchstone for my future."
5,Compelling Story,"The Ten Secrets, A Father's Last Gift is a heartwarming tale that intrigues, inspires, and yes, imparts wisdom. Edwards creates compelling characters through crisp dialogue and distinctive voices. Journey with the main character, Chris Mathews, and be transformed by the ten people he meets. You will be glad you did. This is a wonderful, thought provoking, conversation starting story!"
5,The Ten Secrets A Father's Last Gift,"This book was excellent. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. I shared it with my co-workers and friends the next day. It will definitely be a book that I will give as a gift. It applies to all."
3,Come up with something Original!,"The book is a fine story, but just a complete ripoff of Mitch Albom. The author seems to recycle thoughts from Albom's books, and even designed his cover similar to most of Albom's books....was this an attempt to sell more books?"
4,"Touching, funny, and clever",This is the perfect book for anyone who is trying to figure it all out. I think everyone will see a little of themselves in the main character. It makes you think about who you are and where you are going without being too heavy. The book is like good advice from someone who has been there too. There were lots of little references to make you laugh and insights that you never see coming. It is the perfect Sunday afternoon read.
5,Lessons worth remembering,"The Ten Secrets is a funny and touching novel. I was able to relate to the main character and hope that I can grow as he was able to. The direct writing style is not for someone expecting a flowery romance novel, and it makes it all the more captivating of a read.I dont normally post reviews, but my dad also read the book when he visited for a few days recently and he loved it too. Best part about it was that we had a great chat about our family and our history after he read it. I dont want to sound like a visa commercial, but that conversation was a 'priceless' moment of sharing with my father. This book's reach will be far greater than the pithy story it tells. If you like authors as practical as Dale Carnegie or as inspirational as Victor Frankl, you will thoroughly appreciate the wisdom in The Ten Secrets."
5,Very comfortable and stylist,Very elegant and stylist with comfort. Height is right enough to avoid fatigue of your feet in the long walk. Love to have them.
3,I made it,"I enjoyed several songs on the Cd but the main song was ""I Made It"", but I also was reading the label and realized that a lot of the songs were recorded close to my hometown."
1,Horrible,"This is one of the worst books I ever attempted to read. I finally quit about half way through. The writing was sophmoric and the story completely ridiculous. It was like reading a comic book. How many times do I have to read ""blam! blam!"" when a gun is fired? The idea that an ancient manuscript, once translated, would read like a modern suspense thriller is ludicrous. Or that it could even be translated so quickly. This story is best for grade school children."
4,Almost as good,In the Authors tradition the book has some neat story twists and alot of action.While not a suspence as reading Icestation this is still a very entertaining book.Actually this book tells 2 story's one at the current date and one during spain's colonization of Peru.
1,Written like a 12 year old,"I read Ice Station, and while amateurish was reasonably well written. I suspect that the editors rewrote that one to make it readable. For Temple, they probably either thought that Reilly was successful enough to allow it through without editing or they couldn't find editors willing to undertake the task. I don't blame them. I have never read a professionally published novel that was so badly written in my life. It reads like a 12yo wrote it, with exclamation marks on every second sentence, cartoonish ""BOOM, CRASH, BANG!"" descriptors (the best one is YECCHHH), repeated use of unrealistic words like nanosecond (""a nanosecond before it happened...""), and totally unbelievable scenarios. Other reviewers have described some of the idiotic plot devices used, so I won't go into them here. Suffice to say that if your tastes run to Green Goblin and The Incredible Hulk comics, you might like this book. Otherwise go with Clancy or Forsythe. Or get a lobotomy."
2,Chock full of action...and horrendous prose!,"This book is, perhaps, the first sign of the apocolypse. At the very least, it signifies the end of literature as we know it. Matt Reilly is an ""author"" only in the sense that someone prints his books. His prose is crude, clumsy, and an embarrassment to literate people the world over. He makes liberal use of ellipses and exclamation points, which is fine. If you're ten-years-old. If, however, you intend to write for people who have NOT been lobotomized six or seven times, it would pay to be a little more competent. A little more subtle. I will not even disccuss the plot; it is far-fetched beyond description, requiring not just a suspension of disbelief, but a complete suspension of brain activity. However, I did give it two stars because I actually finished the book. I have to hand it Reilly there; something he did compelled me to find out what happens. In the end though, I think we're all a little dumber for having read this book."
2,Completely Ridiculous,"I decided to try Matthew Reilly because he was recommended based on the fact that I read books by James Rollins. In the beginning, the book seemed intriguing and entertaining. Unfortunately, this did not last. While I am willing to suspended some belief this book asked for far too much suspension. As the book progressed, the main character, who was a professor no less, seemed to get out of situations that were so over the top it was like watching Indian Jones saving himself from an atomic blast by hiding in a refrigerator. Eventually, this book culminated into a final battle that was so over the top when it was over I just rolled my eyes and realized I had wasted a lot of time reading a book that even teenagers would find hard to believe.Honestly, I cannot believe that Reilly could have written this book with a straight face. After this book, I am not inclined to read another by him."
5,A Winner,"This was one of the best books I have read. Sure it is unbeleivable but Hollywood created James Bond and he has survived unbeleivable odds also.Congratulations to a great Australian writer who's novels should be made into movies.I enjoyed the historical manuscript and how it all tied in with the present day. Talk about break neck speed at which all of Matt's books are written, if you enjoy action, action and more action wait till you get your hands on AREA 7 his latest creation.I think Geena Davis would make a great Mother (character in Ice Station and Area 7).I have just read a few of the critical reviews - you have to remember that reading is escapism and fun, if you want facts you shouldn't be looking in the fiction section of your bookstore or library!!"
5,The man who writes screenplays,Suspend belief and enjoy this work as it is. Engross yourself in the gun battles and the feeling of near death. It is one constant ride. Kick up your shoes and enjoy the ride...who knows you might even get a new outlook on life.
1,Avoid at all costs,This is by far the worst action/adventure book I have ever read. I'm surprised that aliens didn't show up at the end to fight against everybody else... How this book ever got a top review is beyond me. Please do not waist your time
2,were there any editors around for the Kindle version?,"First off, i liked the book and have read a number of books by Reilly and like them all.The reason for my revire however, is that the Kindle version has SO MANY missing words and incorrectly scanned words that it became very hard to read. This is especially true at around 64% of the way in to 70%. Did this not come electronically from the publisher?"
4,The action never stops,"Matthew Reilly has created a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat from the time you open the cover. Professor Will Race is late for work at NYU and finds that his day is going to get stranger than he can imagine. From the concrete jungle of New York City to the dark of the Amazon rain forest, from Nazis to American servicemen to Inca warriors, Race finds himself running (and flying) from death at every turn trying to find an ancient key to a decidedly high tech weapon. Like every good hero story, Race also discovers that he is more than he thought he could be. Oh, and he has to save the world. Reilly does a great job of moving the story and keeping the suspense at a high level. I'll be reading more of Reilly's work."
1,Temple,"I bought this book at a used bookstore, sold on the back-flap description. It started slow, had no pacing, became more ridiculous with every page, and failed to produce even one character I could sympathize with. Whether it was the author or the editor who was responsible for the extremely annoying phrasing, it did not help the story at all. The constant need to italizise, and punctuate every other phrase with an exclamation mark! made me feel I was reading someone's bad first draft. It read like a poor attempt at writing a novel that is meant to go straight to screenplay. What's doubly heartbreaking is that the other books of his sound so good. I won't be lured in, though. This one was painful enough."
5,Very nice!,"Reasonable price, cover was bent (may have happened in shipping) but book was in good overall condition. Thanks!"
2,This book sucks!,After reading half this book I was finally worn down by the improbability and stopped. After careful consideration I decided that my time could be better spent watching paint dry.
2,Temple - Matthew Reilly,"I was reading this book and enjoying it thoroughly before I got to page 144. Imagine my surprise when I got to the bottom of the page--""Its black head was absolutely massive. It took up the en-"" and went to the next page where it began ...""agents dressed in blue assault helmets and SWAT gear hurried into the compound after them."" Apparently pages 145 thru 176 are missing! I glanced through the rest of the book and didn't see any other obvious flaws until I got to the excerpt from his book ""Area 7"" - the last 4 pages of the excerpt are cut off on the right side. It looks like some words are missing. Very disappointing."
4,Good read,"This is the second novel by Matthew Reilly I have read, the first being Contest. I am not completely finished with the novel at the time of writing this review, but have stayed awake later than I should on nights just to read more of the book."
3,for fun non stop action,"An unbelievable story with very unrealistic characters, but a fun, refreshing and wonderully entertaining read nevertheless. This is one of my first Matthew Reilly book I've read, but I'll def. pick up another one again."
3,Hard to belive,"This book should have been right up my ally, I am a 17 year old guy who loves action adventure, but this book made the last Dirk Pitt adventure I read seem like a serious look at post cold war espionage. The book is fast paced and does have a good plot-It is a 'fun' read-but I found after the third time the 'hero' was saved at the last instant, I could not suspend my belief any longer. Think of an Arnold Scharznigger movie on a double dose of steroids and you have this book. I actually think this book would have been better if the author had toned it down a bit. If you like comic book adventure this might be a book for you, but you might want to wait for the paperback."
3,An Indiana Jones Style Technothriller,"This was a fast-paced action thriller that combined elements of archeology, Inca history, and hi tech military hardware. William Race, an NYU linguistics professor, is approached by the US Army to go on an archeological expedition in search of an ancient Incan artifact. The artifact is rumored to have the ""power of the gods"" and is a threat to national security. The modern day Indiana Jones embarks on a journey with many twists and turns as rival groups also try to recover the artifact. The story is quite entertaining, but at some points the reader must suspend belief as Professor Race escapes untouched from one fatal situation after another. All in all I really enjoyed this book and even learned something about Inca history. Move over Lara Croft, there's a new Tomb Raider in the Temple."
2,"Slightly entertaining, but...","...ridiculous in the extreme, nonetheless. Overuse of exclamation points was a little annoying. Definitely not on par with Preston/Child or even James Rollins, but I have to admit it did keep me interested. Fine for a beach/vacation read if you like adventure stories."
2,It had possibilities,"Reilly's first published novel, ""Ice Station"" was pretty good. Fast paced, good characters, poor plot, but who cared, the action was wild.In ""Temple"" Matt decided to throw out any attempt to base his book in the ""real"" world. The BASIC story is excellent, but the plot twists, conspiracies, and bad guys (3 separate groups) leave the reader shaking their head, wondering how stupid does the author think we are?The Hero, Race, a quiet university language professor, seems to need a cape and super-strength to pull off half the stunts he himself can't believe he's doing. Even the wildest Willis, Schwarzenegger or Ford movie can only do a third of the stunts ""Temple"" slaps us with in the first half of the book.Matt, here's a hint, if your own characters don't believe what's happenening or what they're doing, why should we?p.s. Stay away from the military conspiracies side stories, they really ruin your work."
2,Balanced mixture of good and crap.,"OK... this book has action. However, it seemed to me that the action sequences were not written for the readers but rather to satisfy Author's need to be tedious and verbose.Here is a question I want to throw at the people who read this book and gave it more than 2 stars.""How did the military test Supernova to see whether it works or not in the first place before it was stolen?""I sure as hell would love to know the answer to this question from the readers who are hyping this book and also the author himself.This book is trash. Dump it and move on to the next one on your list."
3,Good action but not very belivable,Hero wins through despite impossible odds. A very fast moving story line with many twists and turns to delight even the most jaded of readers. A disappointment that major chunks of plot that are very similar to ICE STATION. Swap water for ice and the chase scenes are virtually interchangeable. The use of animals in the plot of the first book was novel - in the second it was a case of deja vu.
3,Good book for teens,"See story summary above.An action packed thrill ride through the jungles. A good story for the comic books. I say this because, as implied elsewhere, it's all so implausible and unbelievable. This title will most be appreciated by young readers. Maybe grades 8-12. But be advised, there is plenty of violence and death.Recommended for younger readers with a taste for adventure."
2,Not as good as Ice Station,"This is the second book I read from Matthew Reilly, and it was a real dissapointment, the first book Ice Station was really good and this one somehow doesn't work as well... The race to find the Idol is ok, but after the Idol is found the story just looses it's fun element. I'll probably buy the next book from Matthew Reilly, but that one had better be good :) Better luck next time..."
1,Disappointment,"I had heard a lot about this writer. Now, after a few pages of Temple, I have put the book down and will not venture any further into it. In the first few pages, a person is hiding in a ""drop ceiling"" in a very old Jesuit monastery; two different countries have built a ""doomsday machine"" that can destroy the Earth and an ancient Inca prince ties a rope to an arrow, shots it into a wooden door and slides down the rope. GIVE ME A BREAK. This is junior high school stuff. I have never felt like I wasted money on reading material but this just changed my mind. I won't even put it in the trash as it would stink it up."
2,Starts off OK...but only gets worse,"This book would be considered an Over-the-top Action Adventure. And when I say Over-the-top, I mean Waaay over-the-top. So much it hurts. I thought the surprises and Twists Matthew Reilly threw in along the way were completely ridiculous and unbelievable. Things to look forward to about this book-Many nanosecond-narrow escapes.-False scientific and military info-Many exploding heads(Reilly probably has a record here)Atleast it's not boring. I can't stand boring books that take half the book to actually become interesting. That's why I gave this book atleast 2 stars. It dives into the action pretty much right away. I found the flashback chapters to be annoying.SPOILER?Are women immortal? After reading Rollins and Reilly I am beginning to think women are the most invincible characters in these ""adventure"" books (besides WILLIAM RACE, of course lol)"
3,Not the best of the genre,"This was a decent book, but if you like it, you'll love Excavation by James Rollins. Read this one first, then Excavation. Trust me."
2,Just too wrong,"Let me start by saying that I'm a big fan of fantastic adventure novels by Clive Cussler and similar, as well as more technical action novels, and usually my suspension of disbelief goes really far...I really wanted to like this novel, but Reilly seems to have made the mistake of getting way too technical and specific without having the remotest clue about what he's writing about. Some of it could have been forgivable, but it was pretty much pervasive through the novel. He confuses fission and fusion at every turn, his supposed planet killer laughs at the basic laws of physics, while he invents some new ones. Even the basic chemistry you learn in high school is just plain wrong. Most of the astronomy is ludicrous, as well. Otherwise, it's probably a real fun novel - if you can get past some really apparent errors."
1,I couldn't put it down quick enough!,"I was given this book for Christmas. It was the worst present I have ever received. Totally unbelievable from beginning to end with cliched characters,plots and juvenile writing full of hackneyed words and phrases. But who am I to complain. Judging by other reviews this book is fantastic-such is life."
1,Ridiculous,"Aside from his limitations in character development, Mr. Reilly can't even do any decent research on his books. If he did, he'd realize that there are no such thing as Jesuit monks, people don't play baseball in New York in January, and a plethora of other details that prove that Mr. Reilly doesn't care to let basic research stand in the way of a story.He does seem to know a lot about weaponry, however, which I suppose is an accurate reflection of his mindset. Be advised."
1,Unbelievability eliminates suspense,".Terrible book.There are many reviews that pan this book because of the complete lack of beleivability and repeated ""...at that exact moment..."" escapes.Others have responded saying its all just for fun and you should not expect literary greatness.My problem with continual narrow escapes (good guys kill 10 guys with 10 bullets - sometimes less, while bad guy misses good guys with 10,000 bullets) is that after a couple of times it removes all of the suspense because you know the good guy will get out of any situation - and I mean any situation."
1,Threw it away 150 pages into it.,"Temple was one of three books by Reilly that I bought when I first heard of him (see reviews for Seven Deadly Wonders and Ice Station). I forced myself to get through Seven Deadly Wonders, enjoyed Ice Station, but after those two, I was only willing to invest a few hours with his antics and stopped once it became too much.Of the two time lines, the older story was interesting and I was primarily reading it to see where that story went because the modern time line was just stupid. Unfortunately, the hero in the ancient story started experiencing miracles typical of Reilly's heroes. At that point, I put the book in the trash. I wouldn't wish inflicting such a poor story on someone that might pick up the book after leaving it behind in my hotel."
4,Templeistic,"The book is yet another enjoyable read in the Matthew Reilly series, filled with the twists that keep you reading until the early hours of the morning wanting to know more."
3,An Average Book,"This book started out slow. Dr Race was made out to me too wimpy to have accomplished all the daring things he did in the book. The other characters were not really fleshed out. My method of telling how good a book is how long it takes me to read it. A 5 rating I will read until it is finished, all day and night!!! This one took me 4 days. It was just not thrilling enough to pull me in but it was okay reading in a good setting."
4,ADVENTURE/SUSPENSE/INTRIGUE/WOW!,"This guy can write, he had my attention throughout the book on a roller coaster ride and the ending was also great. He is on my list of authors to be on look out for from now on. No movie based on it I think could ever do it justice."
2,Slapstick Adventure Under the Guise of a Thriller,"It could have been a good book. The cover looked good, the flyleaf was captivating and the storyline had real potential with nice historical underpinnings. But, it was overwrought with unbelievable scenes and too many last second escapes. It seemed as though he was writing it for a James Bond screenplay rather than an adventure novel. Novelists have used the Nazi storyline since the 1950s, and it seemed to die out in the early 1990s. Not in this book. Anymore it seems like a hackneyed crutch used by a novelist to provide the archetypical bad guys. By the end of the book I felt I had been taken in by a bait and switch con. Slapstick is not what I enjoy reading and had I known what I was getting into, I never would have invested the time to read it."
3,"Over the top, big time","For pure escapist nonsense I liked Ice Station, a story that just kept on snowballing up. This is similar non stop action and you need to suspend belief for the entire book. In Ice Station the hero is a Special Forces soldier, the hero in this is a mild little archaeologist who, by the end of the book, could take on James Bond, Dirk Pitt, Jack Ryan etc single handed, so is less believable then his previous hero. To me, this was like an Indiana Jones film, a non stop rush that should not be thought about for even a nanosecond. If Mr Reilly can peg the next one back just a little there is a very entertaining book in him."
5,Great,"Uses to teach the importantance of names, and how important it is to pronounce names correctly (especially foreign). Through the book, her Mexican-American students come to realize that their names are special. Great book."
5,Great Teaching Tool,"I use this with both students and teachers to show the progression that an immigrant student takes throughout the course of a school year. Through short poems, the reader really gets an idea of what it is like for Jorge as he struggles to adapt to life in his new classroom. I highly recommend this book for ANY school setting.I felt the book did also help teachers understand the importance of learning how to say a student's name correctly. As well as it helps explain what the student might be felling or thinking. This is a MUST HAVE for anyone who works with students from outside of the United States."
3,Excellent product; Lousy Slow Shipping,"I've bought this supplement several times before. Butcher's broom is the active component in several produce formulations and topical treatments for venous diseases and venous insufficiency, such as varicose veins and hemorrhoids. There is some clinical proof that this stuff works, and at least for me, it is very effective for hemorrhoids. When I saw this on Amazon, I thought I could save a few dollars, and ordered it. Unfortunately, I ordered it three weeks ago and still haven't received it. A look at the seller (DIRECT SUPER CENTER) shows that this is the rule rather than the exception, and they send stuff out late, never offer reasons, and never give shipping status updates. Hopefully Amazon will get rid of this seller, as they are not up to par for Amazon marketplace sellers."
3,"GREAT idea, but...","...make sure you have a short car ignition key (if that's what you'll be using it for). My findings after trying one of these on in a local sporting goods store.The problem with all wrist wallets is that unless you have a huge wrist, when you fasten them to your wrist, the wallet contours to your wrist and you don't have much continuous FLAT space to accommodate 3"" car key. The result is not only uncomfortable, unsightly, but also untenable because the pointed end of the key is bound to make a hole in the fabric sooner or later.Looks like I'll just have to stick to my less-than-sexy-looking shoe wallet, sigh..."
2,Should be called Pureabordomalia.,"Pure's brand of psychedelic funk rhythm sounded pretty exciting in the early nineties, but it hasn't aged well. No one will be surprised to learn these guys were produced by the Talking Head's Jerry Harrison, it fits right in with his style. `Greedy' is the track that launched them, but there was no follow up. Probably got noticed because of the success of like minded bands like Jellyfich and The Farm Their space has been taken by jam bands like Phish and Dave Matthews. May be of interest to fans of such music."
3,Self-Hypnosis Training Video,"Sorry, but I did not find this training video helpful for me at all. It's very difficult for me to concentrate...I was lousy at the Lamaze method for natural childbirth...and this was no different. I think personal instruction would have been more effective for me. I gave it a 3 because it might be helpful for people who can concentrate."
3,The best AND the worst ever recorded by Kenny,"One every second title is great jazz music, the other is great supermarket/elavator noise.If your CD player has a program function, or if you are more open minded (or just patient) than me : buy this CD : Computer G or by by blackbird are just great jazz music.If not, forget it and go for more homogeneous CD : Persuance from Kenny Garrett if you like Jazz, and any album from Kenny G if you own a supermarket or operate an elevator."
5,Probably the most underrated Kenny Garrett album,"Kenny Garrett has been thrust to the top of the jazz world through his recent successes, including SONGBOOK and PURSUANCE:THE MUSIC OF JOHN COLTRANE. Many critics overlook this album as one of his great successes. BLACK HOPE was my first exposure to Kenny, and he has been a great influence on my playing ever since. Kenny burns up the track with legend Joe Henderson on COMPUTER G(check out the trading four section on this one)and BYE BYE BLACKBIRD. I also love his original TACIT DANCE and he rolls off an unbelievable solo on JACKIE AND THE BEANSTALK. A must have album for any Kenny fan."
4,"Near-excellent disk from a developing artist, Kenny Garrett","Kenny Garrett's most UNDERRATED album, Black Hope offers a tinge of what Garrett is about: Scorching blues-derived sound over various jazz and R&B rhythms. This is Garrett AFTER Miles and Blakey..."
5,Excellent album,"""Black Hope"" was an excellent contribution to jazz in the 1990s, and holds up very well today. The energy between Kenny Garrett and Joe Henderson is powerful, the compositions are strong, the group dynamic is first-rate, and-- very remarkably-- we get to hear what happens when Kenny Kirkland brings his electric keyboard sounds into a jazz small group situation (although most of the record still features his acoustic piano). I think the results are great: the textures on the more R&B-oriented material are beautiful, and the percussive, subtle synth sounds on the funkier material grooves hard, as does the whole band. Brilliant album, essential for a fan of either Kenny."
3,Pleasant overview,"3 1/2Nice mix of easy listening ballads to Coltrane-esque hard-bop with a little funk in between, Black Hope might try be too many things to too many people for compositional supremacy but this saxophonist delivers beyond decently in all these Jazz sub-genres."
2,Perhaps the most overrated kenny garret album,"i bought this cd after reading some of the reviews and was greatly disappointed. i almost gave up on kenny on the spot, because this cd is so SMOOTH. i mean that in a bad way, as if kenny g(arrett) was trying to be kenny g(orelick).but luckly for me, i bought SONGBOOK soon after, and was very happy. i don't know, if you like the real kenny g, do the jazz world a favor and buy this cd instead. but if you like MODERN JAZZ, stuff that builds off of everything that came before it, try out one of his other ones."
3,Beethoven: Egmont/Wellington,"I have always enjoyed ""Egmont Overture"" but could do without the parts that include singing. I didn't know Beethoven had written short marches (like ""Wellington) but they are interesting, esp the one with what is supposed to have gun shots but sounds more like bubble wrap popping or a bunch of fire crackers"
4,An enuresis-inducing anthology!,"Wow, what a book! I literally wet my pants. I mean, the urine was coming down in barrels! Eww, it was disgusting. Oh, yeah, the book was pretty good, too. Love that Clive Barker kid."
4,enjoyable but biased account of a brilliant thinker,"This is the most recent of several books I've read by or about Noam Chomsky, and I'm still waiting for an objective, critical analysis of the man and his thinking. Though quite enjoyable and full of interesting details (like cover photos of obscure political magazines that Chomsky read as a child), Barsky's biography comes clearly from the pen of someone enamored of Chomsky's ideas and work. The last paragraph of the book sounds embarrasingly like the voiceover from a low-budget propaganda film. Chomsky fans will enjoy the book, but anyone wanting a more balanced approach will still have to wait for the ""definitive biography"", which to my knowledge remains unwritten."
4,Don't be mislead by Olier Kamm (the reviewer),"...As for this biography, I suggest taking a copy out of a library and check it out before purchasing. It does cover some ground, and is an enjoyable read, if you're a fan."
3,"[Three-and-a-half stars out of Four] Chomsky's best...Bravo for the Prof., for standing up for Robert Faurisson...","Obviously anybody with a triple-didget I.Q.can see by even a casual read that Chomskyis a complicated man. Thus many of his booksare at least somewhat complicated reads. Ihighly recommend this as a potential 'Bestof...' book for Anti-Statist fans who alsolike other controversial jewish authors bookslike Murray N. Rothbard (my favorite of thegenre!), Art Koestler (The Thirteenth Tribe),et, al. Also check out Art R. Butz 'Hoax ofthe Twentieth Century', and Walt Sanning'sDissolution of Eastern European Jewry..."
4,Ten Year Old daughter in Heaven...,"Okay, so my kid, now 10, gave up piano years ago. But now wishes she was in The Band! Instead she just follows every move these kids make. I told her she should get back into lessons and she too could be a star. Well, maybe. Anyway, I love that these kids actually have a bit of comedic timing and seem to enjoy every minute they are on camera. I know their parents (Nat and Alex Wolff's Mom and Dad are actor/director and pro musician respectively) are very talented and look like they are having fun with the show too. Get it for your kid if they are a fan. They'll dig it and it's all good fun and totally family friendly. Now we hope her uncle can get their autograph next time we go to LA. He claims to know someone that works with them who is famous in her own right. Cool!"
3,The movie isn't as innocent as it seems..,"I wouldn't say this movie is totally family friendly. For a kids show, it has several sexual references. Nat Wolff pats Rosalina on her butt. They also showed a teen couple kissing really passionately. The youngest band member swears a lot, but replaces them with other words (""poo-poo sauce"").The band members mocked the only girl in the band because she had a crush on a rival band member.Still, I give it 3 stars since it shows that kids can write music and put together a band and even if they fight, they can make up later."
4,IF YOU THINK THESE ARE THE PRICES YOUR GONNA GET AT AUCTION,"THINK AGAIN! THIS BOOK IS VERY HELPFUL IN IDENTIFING WHAT YOU HAVE. BUT...IF YOU LOOK THRU THIS BOOK AND THINK YOUR GONNA MAKE A KILLING ON EBAY, THINK AGAIN! THATS WHAT I THOUGHT. ITEMS ARE ONLY WORTH WHAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY AND MOST OF THESE PRICES SEEM HIGH. ACTION FIGURES AND RARE ITEMS ARE PROBABLY MORE ""IN SYNC"" WITH THE STATED MARKET VALUE THAN ALL OTHER ITEMS."
1,This book gives wrong information.,"This book gives wrong information. for example: it has a picture of the vintage figure Cheif Churpa, and the book calls him ""Wicket."" Need I say more?"
4,Nice little pheromone product,"Comes packaged nicely, nice size little spray bottle for home or to go. I love that it's re-usable and am formulating plans for it already, lol. Has the light musky scent I've come to recognize in pheromone products that are unscented (unscented meaning no added fragrance not actually scent free). The amount of pheromones and copulins isn't terribly high compared to some other pheromone products so if you're looking for something to stop people dead in their tracks, this won't be for you. It's a nice ice breaker, socially friendly product. I quite like it just for that. You can use it in conjunction with other products to get the attention you may be looking for but on it's own I feel it's a nice little product."
2,Lack of credibility a serious flaw in such a book,"Neither author evidently has any professional degree or apparent qualification to write a scientific book. I think that most readers would find them to be considerably more credible if they had such a degree, especially in view of the fact that Morgenthaler and Simms frequently foray onto (and beyond) the fringes of scientific knowledge. Such speculation would perhaps be tolerable if it were being espoused by someone who had a solid base of scientific training who had very sound reasons for conjecturing in this manner; it is difficult if not impossible for a reader who has no scientific background to judge whether or not the speculations of authors who have no scientific training are credible. The cover art and one of the fonts used in the text of this book can be best described as comical; they further detract from the credibility of the book."
5,INFORMATIVE AND ELEGANT,"Unlike all too many of his peers Dr. Helfant recognizes the crucial roles of spirit, will and determination in recovering from life-threatening illnesses. In a series of well-written cases drawn from his long career as a cardiologist he shows how the determining factor between recovery and death is more often a matter of the will to live than the latest medical technology or miracle pill.And to top it off the writing is lucid, elegant and often compelling. I cannot recomend this book higly enough."
5,"Fascinating stories, very well written","I really enjoyed Dr. Helfant's book. The changes these people made in their lives are astonishing, and make for a fascinating read. Dr. Helfant writes in a clear, delightfully sympathetic tone; refreshing to hear a doctor care so much for his patients.This book was great fun to read, and really makes you think as well. I rank it as one of the best books of the year."
2,Past the point of no return,"I was past the point of no return, about two hundred pages, when I tired of the characters themselves who seem to be one dimensional and who act without introspection. Oates was able to give ample exposure to the dark side of behavior, but actions and events seemed to come out of nowhere without foreshadowing. The mystery of human emotions which Oates is known to explore seemed to be revealed as philospical treatise rather than as artfully drawn characterizations. All in all the novel seems more like a social commentary than a human drama."
5,BULLSEYE,This was the album where Ritchie Blackmore started to get the formula right for creating AOR albums.1. Death Alley Driver-11/102. Stone Cold-7/103. Bring On The Night (Dream Chaser)-7/104. Tite Squeeze-7/105. Tearin Out My Heart-7/106. Power-8/107. Miss Mistreated-8/108. Rock Fever-7.5/109. Eyes Of Fire-7/10
3,"Don't like Joe Lynn Turner vocals, but....","This album is the best Rainbow album featuring pop-metal singer Joe Lynn Turner, no doubt about that. This singer, owner of a potent and beautiful voice, unfortunately uses it mostly for singing pop metal tunes talking about love (in a kind of Steve Perry style).Blackmore hired him with the clear intent of breaking mainstream America. The first result of this union was the catastrophic DIFFICULT TO CURE. Blackmore and Glover thought things over and decided to go back to hard rock. The result, STRAIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES, is a very efficient album, not one to make you stunned, but a really good album.Blackmore is playing free and relaxed in it. His riffs are catchy and intelligent, albeit very simple. The nine songs are good, and there's not a feeling in any one of them of being a throwaway or filler.Recommended for Rainbow fans."
2,Where's Ronnie,"What happened to these guys after Dio left? Mediocrityclaims another bad ass rock band.Too bad,man,they were one of my favorites"
4,"Powerful,melodic,soulful.","Recorded in 1982 at Morin Heights,Quebec,Canada(anyone remember the weird Order of the Solar Temple incident that happened there in 1994?),this was a come back album for Rainbow,at that time featuring the golden-throated Joe Lynn Turner and Roger Glover on bass.'Straight Between the Eyes'is easily one of the best Rainbow albums ever,featuring smashes such as'Stone Cold'and'Power'."
3,Another Disc For Die-Hard Everly Fans,"Lots of stuff you can probably do without, lots of unissued tracks and alternate takes that aren't all that good. On the plus side, you'll find the cleanest, crispest versions of songs like ""How Can I Meet Her"", ""Don't Ask Me To Be Friends"" , ""No One Can Make My Sunshine Smile"" and ""So It Always Will Be"", most of which have been on the hissy side in previous packages. Note: Both versions of ""Nancy's Minuet"" on this CD are alternate takes; the original single version is included as a bonus track on the ""Sing Great Country Hits/Gone Gone Gone"" reissue CD. 4 1/2 stars for sound quality, 2 1/2 for content."
5,Constance O'banyon's most wonderful hero yet!,"Reece Starrett is a different kind of hero. Handsome, yes. Honorable, passionate and sexy. Yes, yes, and yes. But Reece isn't your run-of-the-mill rich and powerful hero. He's a poor, hard-working rancher who never imagined a woman like Saber Vincente could be attracted to him. He wrestles with his conscience, trying not to love her, but it is a battle he can't win. Written with sensitivity and the power that only O'Banyon can deliver. Way to go."
5,THIS BOOK REMINDED ME OF VISITING A LOVED FRIEND,"Since I met Saber in TEXAS PROUD, I already knew her by the time she showed up in RIDE THE WIND. Reese is such a wonderful hero--he didn't feel like he was good enough for Saber, but she proved to him that he was. I liked her brother, Noble, entering the book, since we learned his story in Texas Proud. I loved both books and I didn't want them to end. ...A most devoted fan!!!"
1,Awful Storytelling,"I am almost halfway through this book and it is the worst writing that I have ever read. There is no character or relationship development at all. The dialogue is empty between the hero and heroine. The sexual thoughts and scenarios early on are ridiculous. I can't imagine how this book got such rave reviews. There is no depth to the story. It's completely superficial. I'm going to try to speed read through the remainder just to finish it. This book was an early work. I did read ""Wind Warrior"" that was published in 2010 and there's a world of difference between the quality of the writing. I highly recommend that book but not this one."
3,very attractive but coating is not practical,"I love the mug, I have three others from Sango's Nova collection and love those...however, take heed that this one is STONEWARE and does not have that slick surface that 90% of cups have. It is very unnerving when I need to stir things because you can hear the scratching, like you're scraping a rock. I have not scratched it yet but I also do not use it because the texture is just too strange to eat/drink from. Like I said, it's like sculpting a cup from a rock."
5,Wonderful view into another society,This is such a compelling story of the Quakers of a past era--full of tenderness and humor.
4,Made in Mexico?,"This DVD was made in Mexico and the audio at one point is barely audible. I had to grab my remote and turn it WAY up to hear it. The rest of the movie was fine. It's still a GREAT movie, well worth adding to your collection. I WISH it were available in BluRay. It certainly is deserving of its Academy Award nominations! Timeless."
2,Poor connection,"We were very pleased to see this movie available and rented it ...unfortunately, after only a few minutes, it began to ""hang up"" and stop. We tried restarting it several times, always with the same results. We finally gave up and watched something else available with our Prime membership. It was a frustrating experience."
4,Friendly Persuasion,I was caught by the unusual theme in this DVD and was delighted to find a film devoid of explicit sex and violence. I would recommend this to those who yearn for the higher moral and ehtical standards of yesteryear.
2,Incredibly predictable and boring.,"Two stars only because of Gary Cooper. And even with that, just barely. I am blown away by the 5 star rating most seem to give this movie. Apparently I don't get whatever they're getting. My review title says it all."
2,I've Definitely seen better,I'm surprised by how positive the reviews were. The movie was just plain boring. It's not just because it is old -- there are some great old movies. But this isn't one of them.
4,pleased,I received this movie reasonably soon after ordering it. It arrived in good condition. It's a great oldie if you are a fan of classic movies and especially if you like Gary Cooper.
5,Family Favorite,"Our family just loves this movie! We have watched this for years and now our grown children want their own copy. This is a clean movie with no foul language or scenes that would need eyes to be covered. There are laughs throughout the movie. Truly a good family movie. It does run long, but we always enjoy."
5,Love this movie,My husband and I are in our 30's. We absolutely loved this old movie. Good values and of course wonderful acting.
5,Friendly Persuasion,"One of the best movies EVER made. It has comedy, history, the clash of values between generations, and a decent depiction of Quaker lifestyle on the farm."
2,"ducks the issue, whistles in the wind","The film, ostensibly, is about the moral dilemma of conscientious objection to violence - the Quakers who will not fight for a ""good cause."" Sadly, this 1950s stab at a serious subject - in the shadow of nuclear destruction - squibs the effort. Actually, it is closer to a musical comedy than a drama, as though the director knew, for whatever reason, he could not bring off the tougher assignment."
1,"Dated, Superficial, and Musically Challenged","Perhaps because of the period in which it was created, this film just doesn't work anymore. The Quaker theme is a serious one, yet it is portrayed in a frivolous manner. Except for Gary Cooper, the characters are not believable. But the MOST inappropriate element of the film is the Pat Boone music played ad nauseum throughout. A descendant of Indiana Quakers, I was prepared to love this movie. Alas, it was not to be."
3,Wonderful movie,"it was ok, but the one I wanted was the DVD and I accidently had to reorder so kept both of them rather than go to the cost of sending the VHS back"
3,wow.........not really,"this speaker system is ok for about $20 it should never be worth more than that the 2 speaker are decent for their size but the sub cant handle most bass-based song such as rap, dance, etc.... and it does not charge your psp while docked it instead uses a detachable cable like the ones for headphones also the speaker are made form cheap materials 3d sound doesn't do much barely makes the sub louder if you wanna waste like $40 buy the psyclone speaker system its perfect. Do not buy this speaker system if you have i on for a while the speakers start to make an extremely annoying humming noise however the sub works really well if it detaches it would actually worth what i payed intec never makes anything worth while i officially give it 2 stars"
1,bad language,i feel this is not a book for a third grader because amy in the book refers to her brother as a word that i cannot mention on here which should read dirt bag instead of the word they use. my daughter is in third grade and read it and asked why there are bad words in the book. i plan on having it pulled from our school
4,"well-acted, sweet","It's the 1950s in rural Ireland and lovely, unmarried Tara gives birth to a son. Who's the father? She won't say. But the local police sergeant played by Albert Finney is crazy about her, and more than a little crazy in general. He wants to marry her, but she refuses.Enter a group of traveling players led by Milo O'Shea and featuring the comley Aidan Quinn and we have all the ingredients of a classic drama. Add in some smuggling, IRA bombs, a bombastic Catholic priest and the brew starts bubbling nicely.This movie was well-acted and well-written -- the plot has a lot going on; the scenery is lovely; the accents are Irish and Robin Wright is very beautiful. I have just two criticisms: I found the music intrusive and too much like a pastiche of what people think Irish tunes should be. A little more serious, just when you think everything is building to a grand climax, it all kind of peters out to a conventional happy ending. But this is a grand little film to be sure, to be sure."
3,Worth the time spent watching,"Although this is not a ""Great"" film, it is a good representation of a time period and life in that time. It shows the drama of life and how people adjust to make that drama tolerable. You have to watch it more than once to see the silliness of the characters, but it is worth the time. Irish cinema is wonderful."
5,Where would hip-hop be without these guys????,"Countless contemporary ""homies"" owe a debt of gratitude to George Clinton, Bootsy Collins and all the others that introduced the world to P-FUNK. This assemblage of eight of the funkiest tunes ever recorded, expanded, and gloriously ""crunk"" can pump up the volume at any party or even the dullest soiree.The classic ""Flash Light"" gets a new lease on life in a 10 minute-plus version here; the surreal ""Aqua Boogie"" is gloriously ""tight"" in its original 12"" version; while the strings of ""Oh I"" when paired with the beat makes that one a memorable arrangement.Finally, the mixture of ""Theme from the Black Hole and The Big Bang Theory"" from ""Gloryhallistoopid"" takes the listener to a higher plane of existence.The songs are as fresh today as they were two decades ago."
4,not that interesting,"okay this is for serious funk fanatics, best things here are the extended versions of flasahlight, and aqua boogie."
3,"12"" Parliament Review",CD arrived in good condition. Didn't know these extended versions existed. Has a lot of ole school mixes from the 70s. Good traveling music.
4,They are ok.,"the only flaw is that maybe the hard plastic piece is a bit too big. besides that, sound is good, bass is really good."
3,pretty nice for the price,If you are on a strick budget or you need some expendable ear buds with good sound quality.......these fit the bill! Better than all of my low end ear buds I have tried. I purchased these for working out and yard work. Didn't want to cry if I damaged them. These aren't Klipsch s4's but I am happy I purchased them.
2,Musician,"These phones are not as described, bad fit in the ear canal and as for low end response (bass) NOTBut you get what ya pay for I guess, Do not recommend"
3,Is this the demo version of the game?,"I was so excited when I bought this game with the 2 included Guncons. I hooked everything up and sat down to play. Ten minutes later the game was over. There was only one level to the game. After you beat the ""bad guy"" in the plane, the game is over. What's up with that? I'm not kidding about the 10 minutes of gameplay.Don't get me wrong, the graphics were great and I loved the Guncons. I just wish the game had more levels to it."
1,A Real Moral Problem Here,"I will keep this simple, for those who don't seem to get it. This movie was not near as good as the first one. Without Tucker this movie was destined to fail. Second, this movie seems to be saying, if your strapped for cash, go steal it from your neighbor, bad move. Some parts were funny, but all in all it was a waste."
2,Won't Charge,"Nice cable it allows me to sync but will not charge, not sure why, tried plugging into usb port and wall charger..."
3,Not an original,"I am a picky shopper, so when I decided to purchase this item, I did so with the understanding that I would receive a genuine Dell product. However, instead of getting a Dell Axim Sync and Charge cable, I received a Sync & Charge Cable for a Dell Axim. There is a difference! One is an authentic Dell product, while the other is a knock-off. And, as we all know, knock-offs usually don't measure up. So, part of the rating is influenced by the fact it isn't a genuine Dell product.Nonetheless, I have been using the cable for the past week, and so-far it has worked beautifully. Syncing with my laptop and charging my Dell Axim x51v has never been easier, and I no longer need to bring the bulky charging cradle with me. Still, the part that fits into the Dell Axim slot looks and feels cheap, but the cable itself is relatively thick and sturdy. I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone, and gave it a less than stellar rating because it is not a genuine Dell product."
5,An absolute must for the ASCP exam,"Frieda Carson's book is a must buy for anyone in the field of Histotechnology. I would not say that it is an exhaustive book, but it covers a good amount and gives a good representation of general areas, especially those topics that are covered on the ASCP exam. I often find myself referring to it at work. The book does not really delve too deeply into IHC but does provide a very basic primer on it."
4,Good Book,"This is a good read and a good reference book to have. Some concepts can be better explained and newer images (different resolutions) would be a big plus, but overall, it is a book that one should have on the shelf."
2,OVERRATED!,I have this book and the new self-assessment workbook and going through both texts I am annoyed by how many typos/wrong answers I am finding in both of these books!!! For this level I would hope to see zero typos and wrong answers. From other people that I have talked to I am finding that the book by Bancroft is the way to go!
5,great product,I have tried many of different cake eyeliner and this one is the one...Goes on smooth and easy.Dont flake off when it drys..Love it!
4,good product,I bought this to replace my Clinique which had been discontinued.This is a pretty good substitute. It is a good brown and stays on quite well I don't think it is as creamy but is a good product.
3,Good value,For just $8 product performed as expected; has cracked thru w/regular use. Might buy again.
2,"Okay, but not great",I was looking for something that lasts longer and without a need to re-apply. This does not do it for me.
1,"This Book should be called ""Chicken Run""","First Stanley Williams is running from a volcanic eruption. Now, he's running from the truth. Any reader with half a clue will be disgusted with Williams' attempts to disguise the events that led to six scientists deaths. I feel sorry for the victims and their families as well as the other survivors. I felt like yelling, ""Yes, Mr. Williams, there were other survivors!"" Williams continual denial that he never called himself the only survivor is a complete lie. Just see NBC Nightly News, February, 1993. It's a good thing there's another book on the subject so Williams has to come clean about being the ONLY survivor. Obviously he would have never done this otherwise. If you value the truth and good science you'll be very offended by this novel."
1,a really sad look at a preventable disaster,"What's so sad and disturbing about this book is that it's full of excuses by the author. Williams contends, ludicrously, that people at Galeras had to die in order to advance science. These types of cover-ups do an incredible disservice to the scientific community and seek to pull the wool over the eyes of the general public. Williams denies having any guilt, even though he was the leader of an expedition that took a group of mostly inexperienced people into a volcano: ""there is no guilt,"" he writes ""there was only an eruption."" What I read into this, was that Williams is indeed guilty and his unending protests that he did nothing wrong (very similar to some characters in the news over the past few years) are obvious cover-ups. It really left me with an incredibly bad taste in my mouth and absolutely no respect for this man who calls himself a scientist, but doesn't even have the heart to admit that mistakes he made cost people their lives."
5,Women will like it too,"I truly enjoyed this book. One reviewer said women will find it offensive(a male reviewer). I did not. True, all of the scientists on the mountain were men. So what? The rescuers were women and Williams portrays them as the true heroes. Should men be offended? After the eruption the soldiers on the volcano fled and the women led the rescue.People seem to be trying so much to hate the author of this book. Why? He admits over and over that he does not know all the answers.Somenone else has written a book and claims to know all the answers even though she has never been on a volcano.I truly enjoyed this book. Read it and ignore the people who for personal gain or because of professional jealousy or for whatever reason dislike the author. He admits he is human.I thought he came across as a flesh and blood likable man."
3,Surviving Galeras is a trip into Hades!,"In 1993 geologists & volcanologists convened in the Colombian town of Pasto, high in the Northern Andes near Galeras which has a long history of eruptions with a surprisingly low body count. About 5 miles from the crater these scientists were making friends, exchanging research & waiting for their trek up to a live one.I wasn't particularly keen to immerse myself into these volcano-jumpers' lives. Hey, the world is dangerous enough without actually putting myself into the maw of a seething pustule on the cheek of the Earth about to burst! Right?When Stanley Williams is writing about the history of each volcano & its affect on surrounding landscape; weather & populations; other volcanologists & their stories, he forgets how much he lost on Galeras & offers up a fully-fleshed absorbing read."
2,Not very exciting,"This is the story of a man who survived a volcano eruption. He was hurt badly himself. The main story keeps getting interrupted by rememberings of other scientists--a lot of characters, so the story is flooded with 'flash-backs' and the structure starts feeling formulaic and sometimes a little frustrating, because the interruptions break the momentum over and over. The writing's not bad, and you get a pretty good sense of what it's like to work on volcanos, but the story itself isn't very gripping."
1,Surviving Galeras,This book is a lie. Dr. Williams was directly responsible for the deaths at Galeras. He ignored data and warnings about the impending danger. Then he had the nerve to lie to the media about being a hero and the only survivor. Read No Apparent Danger. It's the real story.
1,Williams is held in contempt by his fellow scientists,"One should read Victoria Bruce's ""No Apparent Danger"" to put Williams' book and the related events in the proper context. Williams is an arrogant and dangerous loner who is out for his own self aggrandizement. His view of the events is rather questionable at best."
1,The Karate Kid,This movie SUCK..... the kid can't act.... only because his father got him the job... same....waist of time... watch the orginal....
2,My dad bought me a bike,"This was a predictable remake with just enough newness added in to keep it from going straight to dvd. The cinematography tries to fill in where the story falls short, but it should keep you from falling asleep (maybe). Having the child of a celebrity power couple play the top bill in his maiden cinematic voyage comes across as the shameless pre-fabricated non-event that it is; a $200,000,000 birthday cake. If I had that kind of budget, I would look pretty good too. Some kid's parents buy them toys or clothes, but apparently young Smith's dad bought him a movie franchise."
3,Karate Kid from Amazon.,Dragged in spots. Could not hold my granddaughter's interest and she is taking karate and loves the original Karate Kid.
3,"Good, but nothing new","A mother moves her son to a new home, where he encounters some local bullies, who don't appreciate his affection for a local girl. After a few beatings, he is trained in the martial arts, in order to prepare for a tournament. Sound familiar? If you've seen 1984's The Karate Kid, you've seen this film. Jacket on, jacket off isn't quite as memorable as wax on, wax off, but this is an effective follow-up to the original."
5,Very good,This is a good movie and the DVD come new!! This is the best choice.i love this movie it's the best
5,This is for a gift,"I haven't given this out as a gift yet, but I'm sure they'll love it, I know they wil really like it."
3,Fair plot copy,"It's OK for kids I guess, but I expected something better. The best part of the movie was when Jackie Chan's character used a fly swatter to kill a fly.It took me a while to figure out Dre was a boy and not a girl. He had dreadlocks, very good looking, etc. The end was predictable; even though Dre get pummeled, he gets up to win."
3,"Meh... Okay to see, not to own","I grew up watching the old karate kid, so this was a let down from the start. I recommend to see if you have the chance, but wouldn't go out of my way to own."
4,I get a kick out of (Kung) Fu,"You can't lose with Jackie Chan or, it turns out, with Jaden Smith. The remake of TKK is not The Seven Samurai or Chushingura, but it is good fun with great scenery. The fight and kata sequences are nicely choreographed and none of the wires ever show. The actors are likeable, and it was a nice gesture toward the late Pat Morita to rename Mr. Miyagi as Mr. Han.This is a good-hearted movie with a commendable effort to teach lessons about the proper use of the marital arts and automobiles. The ending concerning the win-at-any-cost coach is an improvement over the original movie. I recommend this movie to viewers who enjoy, however momentarily, the pleasant belief that most students of the martial arts are seeking self-discipline and enlightment, rather than a way to surprise a bully."
1,Suck'd,"Terrible. Jaden Smith can't act his way out of a paper bag, just like his old man, who is listed as ""producer"". Oh brother. Find the '80s original if you must, but leave this tepid remake in the dust."
1,Why do directors use bad actors? Dont' recommend this.,"We all know will smith's kid can't act, yet they continue to use him in movies that have pontential to be good but end up being a disaster. Yes, Will Smith has deep pockets to pay his way through to get his kid in movies but enough is enough. I would not even rent this at the Red Box. I'm a big blu ray/dvd collector but this one will have to be sold off my shelf."
3,Just O.K!,"First of all don't go into this movie expecting it to be exactly like the original ""Karate Kid"" because it's not. With that said, I think Jaden Smith did a pretty good job. Firstly, I don't like the fact that this movie is set in China. Secondly, I think Jackie Chan's performance was below his talent. Third, this movie was over 2 hours, and that was way longer than it had to be. Certain parts just dragged it out longer than it had to be in my opinion. Fourth, the jacket on/jacket off metaphor for was kinda lame. Then again, so was wax on/wax off, but ultimately when it came together it worked. I do like the fact that Jaden Smith actually got a chance to kick some butt in this movie seeing as how any real ""Karate Kid"" fan remembers that Daniel LaRusso got his butt kicked the whole movie. Including, the tournament, and in the end he does some kinda kick winning the whole thing. At any rate, I do think that Jaden Smith should keep acting because he does have a talent for it braids and all."
1,the karate kid remake,"This movie was so bad compared to the original, that as soon as I saw the remake, I had to watch the original again just to get the remake out of my head! This movie cant hold a candle to the original. It fails to have the magic that the original classic had."
1,Doesn't do Justice,"This was a poor remake of a perfectly fine original which never should have been recreated. It has a ghetto spin to it and does not deserve to even be titled ""Karate Kid"" The original was not broke so no use in trying to fix it."
1,Deceptive title,I ordered the dvd/ blueray combo for my son for an early birthday present. When we received it it was only the blueray copy there was no DVD included like is was suppossed to. I would have returned it if my son wasn't so excited but I'm very disappointed that it's advertised as a combo set and you only get one of the discs that are promised.
1,Horrible...,"Pathetic remake to say the least. The original was a classic and appealed to both adults and kids even to this day..this is more of a kid's flick, which is disappointing because most of the original Karate Kid's fans are adults now. If Will Smith wasn't the kid's daddy I'm sure they would have found a BETTER and OLDER actor to play the part and it may have salvaged this remake.Guess it's a good children's movie, but that's about it.""The Karate Kid"" should actually be titled ""The Kung Fu Kid""...but they obviously wanted to piggy back on the original's success.If you're a fan of the original, don't waste your time.FAIL"
1,movie is overated,"Sad to say that Will Smith's son should look for another career, he sucks as as actor. Jaden Smith should go back to acting school, after seeing this and the overacting in the day the earth stood still I think if it were not for has famous parents he would be nameless or unknown. I guess its great to have rich and famous parents. Save your money, see, rent or buy the original a much better movie!"
1,Not The Karate Kid,"While this is a technically sound movie, in of its own right, the use of the title, from a classic movie AND one that actually is involved with Karate is the travesty.This movie has NOTHING to do with karate. Several other martial arts forms are actually used. This was another blatant attempt by Hollywood to suck in an audience because they are expected something that the movie does not offer. I am a serious Jackie Chan fan but I feel that he has betrayed my faith in him by making this movie. Maybe if they had given it some other name I would not be as upset about what I feel is a total lie."
2,The Karate Kid??????,"Quick niggle.......why is this called The Karate Kid, there is no Karate in it. This should have been called The Kung Fu Kid. Instead the title makes no sense except for the fact that this is a complete rip of the original without the depth that made the original a classic. I can see this being an awesome movie for the young ones with the protagonist being 12, but for those that grew up watching the original, this is a huge disappointment."
1,A bit Overrated version..,"I was not feeling this film at all with Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan, this film made the original ""Karate Kid"" look oscar worthy.I do love the original ""Karate Kid"" but this remake with Jaden is another example. why you do not mess around with a classic, the story line is poor..but action scenes decent but can't carry the film, Jackie Chan is no Pat Morita for sure, sure Jackie is great at martial arts but a poor actor, i feel nothing for him..unlike Pat Morita who does a good job in acting.This new ""Karate Kid"" I did not like or will never buy a DVD/BluRay of this, luckily it was a $1 rental, even than that's more than I will ever spend on this new version,thumbs down!"
1,Sad attempt at forcing cultural diversity.,"Some movies should be left alone. You can't take a movie from the 80's about a skinny white Italian kid from the city that learns Karate to defend himself and change it to a Whiney Black kid and expect it to be the same. Would you make a white version of the movie ""Friday"". No... cause it would be a failure just like this movie. Not to mention Jackie Chan is Chinese and not Japanese. Karate is from Japan. Kung Fu is from China. Kinda racist on the part of Hollywood to assume all Asians practice the same martial arts."
2,Don't be fooled by the preview/trailer,"I really wished there was a remote control to fast forward many boring scenes in this remake. If you have seen Kick-Ass and Ip Man (2008), Karate Kid (2010) would be even BIGGER disppointment!Kick-Ass' FUN FACTOR completely kicked KK's ass. Like The Incredibles (2004), I just wished Kick-Ass would continue playing another 2 hours or longer, it was a breeze, whereas, I can't wait for KK to end!Like another reviewer said, ""Seeing an 11-year-old Jaden kiss that 15-year-old Chinese girl (she looks 15 or older) is at best - weird.""And in terms of kungfu, KK is like kindergarten stuff compared to Ip Man's (2008).KK has way too many boring scenes and ALL the action scenes are not great, if I knew better, I would have waited for the TV premiere."
1,the karate kid,"The product was good, but I am unhappy because I needed to have the Spanish language, was for a gift, and only comes in English and French, for it was not helpful"
1,the karate kid,the movie is good but I only received the Blu-ray. The package Supposed to be Blu-ray/DVD combo+ Digital Copy. My children were pretty Sad and I was pretty Pissed
1,NO MORE REMAKES!!,"Ok if this is a remake of the 80s classic The Karate Kid, then it's insulting and sad that Hollywood can't find anything better to do than to redo good movies. How about this for an idea: Remake a movie that was bad to begin with and make it better. Stop messing around with movies that are good all by themselves. 90% of the time, the remake does nothing except destroy the name of the classic. Stop the remake madness and leave these movies alone already. Please!"
5,Enjoyable movie,"The Karate Kid, was about a young boy determined to erase fear in his life by overcoming a group of bullies. I enjoyed the movie because not only did he earn respect in the end, but the bullies also learned a valuable lesson as well. It was based on Kung Fu, not karate, but the overall content was good. I would definitely recommend this movie to others."
1,Only if you don't watch the org.,"This might be O.K. if I had not seen the org.,but I did and its not good.It is however more of the P.C. crap Hollywood pushes for you to spend your money on."
4,Love It!,"As a fan of the original, this movie stood on it's own. Why? Because even though the title was that of the original, the story stood alone. It was wonderful to see Jackie Chan in something other than a comedy. And Jaden is a rising star. If you were comparing it to the original then you missed out because it wasn't. I plan to add it to my library along side with the first one. BTW in the original the lead clearly was not a martial artist but in the remake you can see that Jackie Chan of course and Jaden Smith are both highly skilled."
4,Good remake of a classic,"If you have seen the original, you will notice similarities and differences. All in all, a good remake that a younger generation will enjoy (although I am still partial to the original.)"
2,Bad version of the original,"So they tried to update this from the original, but the first one was MUCH better.Young Smith is too small to be convincing or believable and the plot does not work well.Things happened too fast, and were not nearly as good as the original.Perhaps decent if you had not seen the original, but no where near as ""feel good"" as the old version.I can't bring myself to watch it again."
5,A great remake,"I purchased this for my 4 yr old twins. Although it is definitely a movie for older children (PG-13, I think), we watch it together. The story remains the same as the original a young boy, Jaden Smith, learning martial arts to defend himself."
3,A fine movie if a little more unrealistic than the original,A 12 year old wonders around China and learns karate. The story is a little of a stretch. Chan is a good drunk and as good as ever. Smith plays his role well if not a little too cocky but you knew that was how that was going to go. Nothing surprising but a fine family evening movie. My black belt son thinks the karate looks too fake but I don't have the eye to see that.
2,Karate Kid Blu Ray + DVD,"We were supposed to get a Blu Ray + DVD with this order, but all we got was the Blu Ray. The movie arrived on time, but just disappointing that we did not get what we ordered."
3,"Entertaining, but with an asinine title","This film was entertaining enough, as far as remakes go.However, why would you call a film that promotes KUNG FU, KUNG FU and even more KUNG FU ""The KARATE Kid""??? It had nothing to do with karate, and if they had named it ""The Kung Fu Kid"" I think people would have understood that it was a plot remake.It's insulting to both karate and kung fu. Think I'm exaggerating? Answer me this: Would you make a film about baseball and call it ""The Longest Yard""? Would you make a film about football and call it ""The Bad News Bears""?They are to distinct and separate sports / martial arts. The title of this film promotes the orientalist mentality that everything Asian is indistict: ""It's all the same. All those people look the same. Karate? Kung Fu? It's all the same."""
2,Not easy to install on Corvette,"Instructions are useless. For my 2009 Corvette I had to remove the plastic rail from the new blade, remove the two metal filler rails from the old blade, pull the old blade out, feed the bare rubber new blade in, then slide each of the old metal rails in the upper slots on each side. It was a definite PITA and took over 30 minutes for one side. Also, it wasn't the same as the picture, and there were two per package, not one."
2,Not the best but good for apartments above the first floor,It does not cool as well as it says it should - 850 sq. feet. and a small plastic piece (cord winder) broke immediately and I've asked for a replacement which they did not send.
1,"Horrible, Horrible Unit","I have friends who have portable units, and this one majorly underperformed. In order to receive any cooling at all, you have to stand in front of it. In fact, aside from making noise, it really did almost nothing. It was also clearly damaged when I received it.Avoid this at all costs. If there is a good part about this story, it's that Amazon has a great return policy. Very quick pickup. But on the other hand, this product is simply a waste of time."
1,Disaster from start to finish,"The unit was ordered from J&R via Amazon and received in a seriously damaged and patched-up package. There was a wheel missing, the deflector fins loose in the bottom of the box and other damage. J&R refused to ship an immediate replacement, so I ordered a second one on my cost as I needed it urgently. This was never delivered as UPS returned it to J&R due to a confusion oner the damage claim. After numerous phone calls J&R and Amazon finally reimbursed the double cost and the shipping. DeLonghi should find themselves better distributors."
1,Disappointing!!,Delonghi should contact me for details.This unit works but the compressor shuts off after running only 5 or so minutes!
3,Works OK,I was lucky enough to get this shipped overnight to my house from New York for only $3.99 before Amazon realized what was going on. The FedEx guy couldn't believe it. I looked up the shipping and it was more than I paid for the unit. Mine arrived in good condition. I only use it in about a 100 square foot bedroom and it works good except for the fact that the built in GFCI plug frequently trips. I plan on cutting it off and installing a normal plug.
5,Required reading,"This book should be required reading for everyone, not just latin american men and women, as we all navigate through the globally shifting AIDS health crisis and the direct correlation to mutable sexual identities, mores and values. I learned things from this book that woke me up to world issues, the continuing struggle of female sexual rights. I use this book as a valuable reference."
1,Don't waste your money,"After returning one lot thinking it was a bad batch, I have another set and they are just the same - i.e. I can write to them but they may or may not verify in the same recorder/player and certainly will not be readable on another player. The same exact problem occurs when recording on another recorder so it is not the recorder. I have used other brands and they are fine, these are just CR@P and have caused me to WASTE A LOT OF TIME :("
1,Memorex 25 pack CDRW80 Discs,"This is the worst disc product i have ever came across, since i bought it i have only use one disc, after putting music in it, it refuse to play in other computers, it refuse to play in a player, i tried to make it repent, but no way. you can give it a try, may be the CD does not like me."
1,Be careful purchasing from J&R Music and Computer World,I purchased 4x-12x speed rw CDROM and they sent me 24X. I called them and they have no stock - instead of notifying me my product is not in stock they intentionally sent me the wrong product. Now I have the hassle of returning it....
2,CHEAP and BADLY MADE,"This was a real dissappointment. The colors looked great and the prices so low, but the product is badly made - not enough glaze on the clay and it is rough! Food sticks on the rough surfaces as a result. The cook ware is worse. I returned it."
3,not that lyrical,Kurupt promised tha old Kurupt on this album but failed to deliver. Excessive cursing dominates tha album but Daz comes very nice with tha beats. I Git High and Nina are tha stand out tracks.
2,"Same Day, Predicable Album.","Kurupt has made some good albums in the past, but this one is real dissappointment from him, I Expected more from this guy, but the writing is not impressive and the lyrical content is out of reach, although there are some good songs, west coast fans will love him and that's fine, but I Thought it was too predicable and too over the top.Thumbs Down."
4,A pleasant surprise,"I was interested in this book because it was Christmas-themed. I liked it because it was so different than anything I've read before. I had never heard of the type of Christian journaling that Mary Georgiana was led to (I never thought of what I would ask any Bible figures), and while I don't believe I have the biblical knowledge to take such a journey, I found Mary's journal enlightening. There is a perspective on the symbolism of the gift of myrrh that had never been presented to me, even in Bible Study class.I would have given it five stars, but it seemed to end a bit too abruptly. (Yes, I realize it's a novella.) I guess what surprised me most was the endnotes: this is the same author of ""Velma Still Cooks in Leeway,"" a book I didn't like enough to read past the first chapter.A good book for the season of Advent, as I think it does get us in the mindset of Preparation."
4,Pulcinella in full,"It's nice to hear the Pulcinella performed outside of its suite format, and this cd offers the whole ballet score. I can't compare it to other recordings, but the sound here is crisp and distinct, and the vocal soloists generally add to the vibrant harmonies of the small orchestra, rather than detract. Pulcinella is Stravinsky's departure, so to speak, from his early modernist blockbusters like Rite and Patrushka, and his genesis in the neoclassical. It is probably my second favorite of his ballet's. A great piece of art.The cd also offers another of his later works, a piece that supposedly tried to emulate Bach's Brandenburg Concerti, but seems to me more modernist than neoclassical. Its rhythms sometimes become unruly, a little like the Rite of Spring (a little). All in all, though, this is a good addition to Pulcinella.The cd closes by playing some of the original 18th century chamber music from which Stravinsky made his Pulcinella.A good cd all in all."
2,Boring,"Sorry, Eno. after an eight-year hiatus from instrumental music, the Balding One comes back with...this?? Half of this album sounds like a computer program (I'm not sure that it isn't, what with Eno's ""generative"" concept), and the other half is just plain boring.Actually, not all of the album is that bad. The track ""Ikekuburo"" is really a very good piece, one I enjoy listening to quite often. Buy the album for that track alone - all the rest simply sound too rigid and ""programmed"" for me."
4,Relaxation Music,"I bought this after hearing a cut from P. Gabriel's ""Plus From Us"". I already had Eno's ""Apollo"" which I enjoyed very much. The opening track is the star of this record - probably one of the most beautiful audio textures I have ever heard. The rest of the record is along this same approach - more like audio atmospheres rather than ""songs"". The bad part is that this CD is so enchanting and relaxing that I always fall asleep after the 5th or 6th song - so I can't vouch for the whole thing! Other songs on here contain Eno's signature of studio ingenuity once again as will be revealed should you buy this CD. Studio engineers and insomniacs alike should not be caught without this little gem."
3,Not what's pictured!,"The djembe I received was not the one pictured. It's smaller! Maybe the 7 should mean something to me but this was my first djembe purchase. It looks exactly the same as photo but shorter. I was bummed. Also mine had a blemish on the goatskin, almost like it was a display item. Just know what you're getting."
1,itch,This chair has some lacquer or chemical that caused everyone in my family to break out with contact dermatitis. Lots of rashes for everyone and lots of misery. DO NOT BUY THIS CHAIR
4,"Down-to-Earth, Touching and Hilarious!","Prior to having my baby, I dreaded the ""research"" of reading the typical baby books. TOO BORING! I couldn't put this book down! The author's approach is so down-to-earth and personal, I felt like I was reading about a friend. It made me laugh and brought tears to my eyes, the whole way through. I would recommend this book to anyone who's expecting. It's very informative and entertaining!"
4,Everything No One Tells You,"When you're pregnant for the first time, you get advice from all corners of the world. There are many books to help out...but no one tells you about the stuff that happens *after* the baby is born! First Time Mom provides wonderful and hilarious insight into the ""after months"", allowing a new mom to be fully prepared for what's in store. ""My Book of Lists"" is great!"
3,Only 4 heads,The picture and description is misleading. Don't be fooled. There are only 4 drumheads in the pack. Three toms and a snare head. There is no bass head. Other than that they seem to be very durable. I'm only giving it 2 stars because of the poor description. The actual product isn't bad.
3,"i love it, and its old","its an old game so the graphics are not amazing but the game in fact is nice, well done, smart and different, long but not too long, easy to control but so easy to win, i love it"
1,only one,"only one ok song on this , I don't know what to tell you but don't spend your cash on it.Guaranteed to burning your money."
2,Received Rubber Boots Only,Kit contained four rubber boots only.Kit does not contain metal cylinders designed to fit inside boot which slide along caliper bolts nor does kit contain tube of grease clearly shown in the product photo.Product did not meet my expectations of a Professional Grade Caliper Hardware Kit.
2,Bluetooth Dies,"After having my phone for about 3 months the bluetooth has stopped working properly. It now connects to a headset and disconnects with 2 minutes. When I bought the phone this never happened, in fact I thought it was my headset so I bought a new one. I have now tried 4 different headsets and have come to the conclusion it is the phone. If you do not wish to use a bluetooth headset then this phone is good but I recommend a different phone for bluetooth use."
2,Bluetooth Feature Died After 3 Months,"I bought this phone for two reasons, 1) it easily fits in my pockets and 2) it pairs with my car's integrated Bluetooth hands-free system. After about 3 months (May to August), the Bluetooth feature no longer works. It doesn't connect to my car's system, and it doesn't connect to my wife's brand new Motorola T305 hands-free system. My wife's phone (a 2 year old LG Chocolate) still connects to all of our Bluetooth systems, so I'm certain it's my VX8700 that's not working.I really like the look and feel of this phone, so I'm going to see if Verizon has a solution for the Bluetooth problem. If they do, I'll update this review.At least it still fits in my pockets!"
4,Love it!,"I love this phone, I've had it about 7 months and it has been great. The outside screen IS hard to see in sunlight, and yes it's squared and angular, but the metal exterior shell holds up better than any phone I've had in the last 15 years. Works great with both of the Bluetooth headsets I've used at one time or another. No problem picking up good reception in comparison to other Verizon phones in the same area."
2,Hated the phone almost as much as I hate VerizoneWireless,"After having a LG chocolate for over a year, and having it replaced 5 times under warranty, it broke again. Verizon replaced it with this lovely phone, which is missing many of the features the chocolate had. It has no music alarm, and though the camera is 2MP, it has no auto focus. Getting pictures that are not blurry is very complicated, and usually impossible. It is not very ergonomic and my hand would hurt after talking on it too long, as would the phone heat up quite a bit after about a 20 minute conversation. The keys are not conducive to texting at all, I deleted many a long, almost finished text by trying to type something from the 3 key and hitting end instead.I called Verizon Customer service to get a comparable phone to my old chocolate, since it was not my choice at all to get this phone. I ended up trading up to a samsung U900 flipshot, only paid $70, and love it!"
4,Good solid phone,"I've owned this phone for a couple of months now and here are my thoughts on it:The Good-------------- Feels pretty solid in construction- Excellent battery life- Great sound quality for calls- Has a MicroSD card slot to store pictures and other things on- Good signal reception- Decent camera for impromptu needs- Works with BitPim 1.0.5The Bad-------------- Side buttons are easy to press by mistake- Can't access MicroSD card slot without removing the battery- Charge/Data slot cover feels like it could break off very easily- USB drivers for data cable can be difficult to track down- Screen is all but impossible to see in direct sunlightI basically only use my phone as a phone, not some ""the kitchen sink is in here somewhere"" type of device, and the VX8700 has served me quite well. There are probably better choices if you want a ""do everything"" phone, but if you're looking primarily for a good solid phone this would be a good choice."
4,really cool,"i love this phone, love the style, and the dual hinge for texting, the thiness, but i have to say i'm not thrilled with the call quality, which is one of the reasons i got and switched from cingular to verizon...i'm in nyc, so it's not like there's no coverage...why can't carriers make call quality as awesome as the phones?"
2,Eh it's ok i guess,"I had this for over two years and i am already wishing to switch phones. It was an awesome phone when i got it at first it's slick, silver, slim, etc. but the quality of the phone is poo poo. The battery life is a disaster, it dies out very very fast. The camera quality got significantly worse(yes i know all lenses get scratched) but this phone just gets worse and worse through the years. The silver cover gets scratched and it looks like mortal hell lol. The keypad is nearly invisible so it's frustrating when you are trying to text. Anyways, im ready to change my phone to a blackberry so i am excited."
3,repetitive,When a man is chained to a wall for 7 years the days run together. It's a good book but there are other prisoner memoirs that are better.
5,"A strong, heart-felt account of hostage survival","This book is a must read for those interesed in learning more about the political and religious turmoil that grips the Middle East. Terry Anderson takes the time to describe the region in all its misery. Anderson remains factual and true throughout the book, rather than providing sensationalism. His account of hostage life is very gripping and depressing. He makes one feel good to be alive and free."
5,WOW!!!,This was great service and the product arrived just as advertised and on time. I am so pleased!!
4,It's Good,"I don't usually purchase country and western CDs, but I wanted WE Still Trust In God. It was worth every penny I paid. The whole CD is excellent."
5,"Diamond Rio, you are the best!","Not a country western fan, had not heard of Diamond Rio. Was a guest to their concert and now I am one of their biggest fans! This album put together songs that pull on your heartstrings and brings a refreshing to your mind."
5,Diamond Rio Greatest Hits II,"Awsome c.d. Bought it for the song GOD Only Cries for the Living, but love the entire c.d."
4,Diamond Rio Greatest Hits,I bought this cd just for a couple of songs they sing but as it turns out the whole thing is good.
2,DIAMOND RIO G.H. 2,"THIS IS AN OK CD. IM NOT REALLY A ""FAN"" OF DIAMOND RIO. I LIKE THEIR NEWER SONGS SUCH AS ""ONE MORE DAY"" AND ""BEAUTIFUL MESS"". IF YOR A DIAMOND RIO FAN YOU SHOULD GET THIS CD. BUT IF YOU'RE LIKE ME AND ONLY LIKE A FEW SONGS I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT."
5,A Favorite,If you like Diamond Rio you'll love this CD. It's one I play almost everyday - several times a day. Sometimes you get a CD and only like 1 or 2 songs - I enjoy every song on this CD.
5,Good music,The quality of the music gives manyh hours of enjoyment. Downloading was easy. I would recommend this product to others.
3,Doesn't fit RAZR V3.,"I'd bought this ""Y"" cable with the expectation that I'd be able to charge my RAZR V3 on one of the ""Y""'s output connectors, and a Motorola Bluetooth unit on the other - they have dissimilar sockets, requiring separate chargers/connectors (???). This cable appeared to be a purchasable solution.Unfortunately, both output connectors matched the Bluetooth adapter; neither the input connector nor the output connectors fit my RAZR V3 phone or its charger."
1,What phone models does this charge,This charger definitely does not work with the Razr. What models does this work with? Amazon doesnt mention them.
4,Convenient little gadget,"It works as advertised. What more can I say? It's handy to take in the car or pack so you only need to carry one charger for, in my case, my phone and my bluetooth earpiece. It would also work for charging two phones with one charger."
1,Not quite what I was expecting,"I have a Motorola E815 and H500 Headset (love them both). This Y Charger adapter will not work with this combination. The input is mini USB and the output in Mini USB and phone charger, but when I plugged the charger connection into my phone, the gave me an unable to charge message."
1,Y STANDS FOR YO-YO,"The Motorola ""y"" charger adapter is useless unless you are a mechanic. Inserting this into your earpiece is a piece of cake -well where do you plus in the rest???? Anyone have an extra phone? I wanted the electrical charger which is cheaper, easier to just plug into wall and headpiece and after an hour or two start using.If you need accessories for wireless phones, you should go to the company's store and talk to their technicians and do it right the first time. Ordering from a website makes you an easy prey."
4,Great Cal/Mag/D product - content mislabeled,"This is a great product. As long as I take it with food it does not upset my stomach or cause digestive upset. It is a great help with relieving muscles spasms. The only issue is that the product is not labeled correctly here on Amazon.The bottle I received reads: 1 Tablet contains 500 IU Vitamin D-3 (as cholecalciferol), 200 mg Calcium (amino acid chelate) and 100 mg Magnesium (amino acid chelate).The product description says there is 250 mg Calcium, 125 mg Magnesium.... which would lead one to believe that you are getting a more potent formula than what is available at other sellers. Source Naturals does not advertise a 250/125 formula on the company website.Bottom line, it's a great product, but I didn't recieve what was advertised."
3,"Informative, but boring","Assigned as a textbook. The book is pretty informative, and a good text for those with a limited background in transportation planning. However, it is mostly boring, and can be a very dense read at times. It also appears that some of the chapters have never been updated despite being the third edition, many use old data to come to questionable conclusions while making examples. Other chapters appear to be fully up to date and aware of the current conditions of things."
4,Informative and Inventive,"It's nice to know there is someone else in the world who is as conservative with their money as the rest of us. ""Life After Graduation"" brought light to many new ideas on how to make each dollar stretch a little further. As a recent college graduate, the book helped in negotiating and gaining a solid start financially. It is great that someone to the opportunity to put ideas like this together in one book. Kudos to the authors for being inventive in their business prospect."
5,Great book with tons of information for the recent Grad,It was a great book with tons of great ideas.
2,Little practical knowledge,"Most of the items presented in this book are random 'common sense' ways of saving money. For instance, to save money at the theater the author's recommend going to a matinee. I think the general public can figure out (on their own) most of the subjects presented in this book."
1,Too simple to be useful,"This book was too simple to be the least bit helpful. It provided just brief overviews of common-sense tips that anyone with even just a little personal financial knowledge would find painful to read. If you're looking for a 5th grade book about financial advice, buy this book. If you're a new graduate looking for useful information that doesn't assume you're stupid, then look elsewhere because you won't find it here."
3,not really hearty,"Madison Finn 11 can be romantic yet it thumps the heart (between Fiona and egg). It doesn't really freak us out but i like it. But i really wish it was Hart than Dan because from Madison Finn 1 up to the end, Madison longs for Dan."
1,Repercussion fails in telling story of amputee,"The Author,Podson, writes... a distracting, superfluous and boring book about the life of an amateur dancer who lost leg in vehicular accident. The book could have been inspirational and moving but it's just too badly written and in need of editing. I purchased the book because of the star rating ;but this is misleading. I am going to send it back to Amazon.com for a possible refund as I could not finish reading it."
1,Terribly written book about amputee dancer,Antonio is involved in hit and run accident. Author India Podson fails miserably in telling his story and the Repercussions he suffered from losing his leg. Antonio also lost his marriage and almost lost his ability and desire to dance again. But he overcame his self pity and handicap and therefore triumphed over adversity. The problem is in the writing. Too much reporting and not enough writing . Weak characters. Long winded superfluous sentences. Not enough dialogue. Cumbersome and boring to read. It needs editing.Could not bring myself to finish it.The ironic thing is that Antonio (or the real person) whose story this is would have probably done a better job if he would have written this book from the heart .
5,An inspiration to all that say they cannot!,"Something changes, and you are not able to exercise your passion. What do you do?This story tells of how one person overcame and shared his experience so others could as well.A story that should be read by anyone who thinks they've been stopped."
2,"Talented writer, but bad book","This book is about a band that could never make it in the rock scene in NY (or did they?), and the author tirelessly rips them appart. I had many problems with this book. Number one, isn't it a little easy to rip on a band that never made it. It's a little like picking on the smallest kid in school. It's easy, but why bother. Second, Sorrentino writes the book in a strange and creative structure. But, a cool structure doesn't make up for a dull story. Most of the book is about one night when the band just plays at a club. Pulp Fiction wasn't a good movie just because it had an interesting structure, it was an interesting story to begin with.The worst chapter is Dub 3 (Vocals) where every character is asked the same three questions. Again, these are not interesting questions, or answers. It's just people rambling. I know some people liked it, and I thought I would like it too, but in the end it just sounds like a talented writer with no direction or motivation."
3,transcends the trickery,"One grows tired of post-modern trickery and yet this novel has its ineffable charms, which it deploys with unerring accuracy. I forsee very good things from young Sorrentino. This book is but an augury"
3,Edgy.,"This is one of a thousand alternative collections out there, but the majority is pretty good. Basically you get the biggest hits from They Might Be Giants, Concrete Blonde, and Jellyfish. Great cuts from Pixies, Happy Mondays, and a Julee Cruise song from the ""Twin Peaks"" soundtrack. I'd have given this another star if the Jerry Harrison song was ""Man With A Gun"", but oh well. Ahh the early 90's."
3,Didn't care for the finish,"I returned this product, because I did not care for the Danze Oil Rubbed Bronze finish. The faucet itself seemed well made, but the ORB finish is more red than I expected, so I never installed it."
1,Orbee Obsessed,I bought these balls because both my German Shepherds love Orbee balls. I was EXTREMLY disappointed however because within days the top layer on all 3 balls started to peel off. Will not buy the Tennis ball style again
2,Fun but NOT indestructible,"While my foster dog LOVED his new orbee tennis ball, he managed to disable it in under 1 hour. I was not thrilled as it was listed as a 5 out of 5 chomper (for aggressive chewers). So far the only indestructible ball I've found is the bow wowzer. Hopefully the Otis and Claude ""rita ball"" will prove to be a dependable 2nd."
3,Ok for aggressive chewers,"We have very aggressive chewers, and right away they found a way to separate the layers of one of the three balls.The other two have lasted, but we a ball that constructed with one piece of material instead of layers."
1,Tennis ball LOVER has NO interest in this product,"My crazy tennis ball loving freak of a yellow lab has zero interest in this toy, which is a bummer, since his breath needs help! He's NEVER picked it up, in fact when I gave it to him he immediately dropped it. Maybe if it smelled like dog-you-know-what he would like it better...otherwise, just an overpriced tennis ball that I took a chance on!"
2,Lasted 3 days...,My chessie tore these apart in days. I wasn't letting her just 'chew' on them either. She was able to separate the yellow from just playing ball.
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"As soon as I gave this ball to my dog, the yellow bits of the ball started to peel off. I had to take it away and toss within 10 mins so they don't swallow the pieces."
2,not strong enough,"i bought these balls for my 7 month scottie thinking he would not be able to destory these balls.....wrong!!.....he went through all three balls in a weeks time. i would definitely ""not"" recommend these balls to any heavy chewer....the balls will be history before you know it.p.s. the reason these balls don't last is because the yellow part of the ball is another piece of rubber glued on top the actually rubber ball. the glue is not strong enough to keep it in tact."
4,Planet Dog A++++,Planet dog balls are the only ones we have. They are industructable. I thought this would have been alittle bigger
2,Not worth it,"I bought the ball for my dog to play with while I ran errands. He seemed to enjoy it, but after one week, a large portion of the yellow rubber part of the ball was torn off and probably had been eaten. The yellow part appeared to be glued together by flimsy glue. Not cool. If your dog was an aggressive chewer, I wouldn't recommend it unless you were supervising your dog while playing."
3,Can't wear your ipod with this skin,"If you're in the market for a silicon skin, these can be had for a reasonable price (I paid $4.99 for a set of 3 in amazon's marketplace)...BUT, be aware that you can not use this with the cord-fitted cap which comes with the ipod. I hadn't realized this when I purchased these, and it makes the product substantially less useful (for me).Now, if you're going to carry it in a pocket, or throw it in a purse or briefcase, and don't care about the cord- well then, these are as good as any (and more reaonable than most at less than $2 each!)"
3,Not too bad of a book,"I worked though the entired book and did all the exercises. I can honestly say I learned a lot of stuff I did not know before. The exercises were straight forward and clear; I had no problem doing them. But compare to other books about Office programs this one is somewhat boring. There are none of the color pictures. Also while this book will introduce you to most of Word's functions, but will not explore those functions in great detail. Shop around before buying this book."
4,good photo selection,"This book is exactly what I hoped it to be. Despite the fact that you can find better Robert Capa's books in this one photos have been carefully and right chosen, so I would recommend it to other people"
4,Fond Memories,"I loved this book as a child. The new edition has illustrations that are less whimsical but certainly more updated. Instead of feeling offended by the language...(Yes, the author is Black)...I think this story is a excellent way to introduce the idea of 'audience' to your students After all, it was written in the 70s and is directed to a 70s audience.Growing up it was one of the only children's books that I was exposed to that had Black characters and she was a powerful character too. She knew what she was talking about and was totally in control. She wasn't a token character colored brown to suit PC sentiments.Anyhow, this was one of my favorite stories growing up and I still have the copy that I loved as a child."
4,Politically Poignant by Definition,"Spinspeak II... how poignant and what a timely release. During this political season, as we are overwhelmed with the chatter of weasels and their pundits, Baar cuts through the poppycock and tells it like it is. This book is the antidote to the spinmeisters and 'politically correct' police who want to humbug us or scare us into thinking that two plus two is seven... or maybe three. Baar sheds light on that insanity. It's a very funny read. This book is a must have."
1,Hav'nt i heard this song before?,"Listen to ""Street Fighting Man"" of ""The Rolling Stones"" and you'll know what i mean."
5,Great Great Great Song,I disagree with one of the reviews below. This quite possibly IS one of the best Rock songs I have heard! In the last couple of years for sure. Rock on Oasis!!
3,Heavy duty does not necessarily mean thick,"I bought this equipment mat to go under my new Horizon CFS Upright Bike and protect the hardwood floors in my apartment. It is perhaps the thinnest equipment mat I've ever seen. Also, I assembled the bike on top of the mat and have a small tear in the mat as a result (from when one of the metal parts scraped the mat). Mat is definitely long enough, but barely wide enough for my bike (which isn't very bulky). If you're looking for true heavy duty protection for your floors, I would choose another product. But if you only need some basic protection for your floor this is good enough."
2,Wrong size shipped twice,The description on Amazon.com said that it was 7 feet long. Twice they sent me a mat that was only 6 feet long. I called customer service and they said that they must not actually have the product that I ordered. I cancelled my order and ended up ordering a different mat (7 feet long) that unfortunately was twice the price.
4,new york nick smooth and souful,nick scotti is a great looking guy with a great sounding voice smooth sexy soulful and a little playful at the same time like he had a good time doing this record as you might guess my favorite track is the one he does with madonna but the whole cd is great for driving romancing slow dancing or just relaxing good one nick but why nothing since then except for the track from the kiss me guido soundtrack?
1,BEWARE OF SELLER,"I strongly recommend buying this from another seller who won't call you a ""f*cking as*hole"" when your Cd doesn't come. That is what he did to me. I never received my CD and when I inquired about it. He verbally abused me. You should know how this seller treats his customers."
1,SUCKS!!!,"This recording is awful, technically, not musically. The recordings were made in 1947 and 1957, that's over 60 years ago! Imagine what kind of equipment they had. Played on a modern sound system, the distortion is almost unlistenable. I threw the case away before I played it or I would have returned it. I'm currently shopping for a more modern version."
5,"This CD Makes my ""Top 10 Stuck on a Desert Island"" Picks","This album is one of those rare gems which you will enjoy from song 1 through the very end. So sad these guys broke up before they ever became BRILLIANT. If you like The Ocean Blue, you'll LOVE Riverside."
2,Massager has a flaw.,"The Wahl massager itself is OK, but the attachment for which I purchased the massager does not fit on the massager. The opening of the attachment is MUCH narrower than the post on which it is to be attached. I had to use the attachment from my old massager in order to use the new massager. I'm very disappointed."
1,haven't got the product!!! They are not responsable at all!!!,"over one month, but I still haven't got my product! Never buy from them again!"
4,nice massager for your neck,"THIS IS A REALLY GOOD MASSAGER TO USE ON YOUR OWN BECAUSE IT IS NOT HEAVY. I HAVE NECK PROBLEMS SO I CAN USE THIS MASSAGER MYSELF WITHOUT ANY STRAIN. I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT SEVERAL TIMES BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A GOOD PRODUCT, BUT THE ONLY THING THAT IS WRONG WITH IT IS THAT THE CORD GETS LOOSE FROM THE BASE AND CAUSES THE MASSAGER TO SHORT OUT. THE IS A PROBLEM WITH EVERY ONE OF THEM. IF THIS PROBLEM COULD BE FIXED THE PRODUCT WOULD BE PERFECT!"
1,MEN: Do not even bother,"After a tough work out, I desperately need a strong massager to get out knots. After reading reviews that mentioned that this was strong, I figured I'd give it a shot since it was 25 dollars vs 100 to replace my broken brookstone massager. Big mistake. This thing is tiny and I can barely feel it against any of my muscles. Once I push down, the motor isn't strong enough to push back against a single one of my muscle groups. It's pathetic and irritating frankly; the ""Powerful Therapeutic Massager"" claim plastered on the box borders on false advertising, so look elsewhere."
4,UNDERATED DUO,EIGHTBALL AND MJG RETURN WITH ANOTHER BANGER AND IT DOES NOT DISAPOINT. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 30 ROCK AND THE LAST 2 SONGS THE WHOLE CD IS GOOD. THEY SHOULD NEVER DO ANOTHER SONG WITH P. SHITTY
2,Blame Puffy,"It is sad that these two southern hip-hop legends good names have been blemished by Bad Boy records. The transformation from their classic hit ""on the outside looking in"" along with a host of other great albums to this disgrace is quite sad. I'm sure your boy puffy offered alot more money and fame than they have ever had in the underground, and it hurt 'em. Some will say ""well thats what you get for being a sell out"" but if your in the game making underground hits for almost 2 decades and your only know to a small region, you may not feel the accomplishment or respect you deserve. I forgive them, not Puffy. Buy some of their old stuff."
3,liked them before they joined bad boy,diddy should let ball and g go back to that pimped out dirty souith houston-memphis flow they was sic wid it back in the days but no they had to join bad boy and make not one but 2 albums that pissed off their fans still not a bad album it would be better if diddy or bad boy was;nt involved.
4,manilow II,I bought this album back in the 70s on LP. I have played it so much that you can here that I have when it is played. Decided to buy the CD and therefore have this album forever and in good condition for as long as I look after it. This is one of my favourite albums of Manilow.
4,This is one sturdy tool!,"I will not tell you how many strainers I have busted the handles off trying to cleanthem but this one is built like a battle ship.If it was a little larger I would be in heaven.This is new to my kitchen, used only once but I think this a winner."
3,Will someone inform potential buyers the diameter of the skimmer?,"Will someone inform potential buyers the diameter of the skimmer? Amazon.com's description lacks the diameter of this skimmer. So do all the reviews. Some say ""it's wider than I had thought"" but doesn't provide the information. The manufacturer's web site only says it is ""wide"". Thanks in advance."
4,Nice fine mesh skimmer.,"I already had a small, basket shaped fine mesh skimmer, but wanted a little larger one, so I ordered this product. Although it's a nice heavy duty fine mesh skimmer, I do wish it was a little larger in size/dimension."
5,Great product,"High quality product, it was exactly what my sister, a discerning cook, was expecting and hoping for. Solidly made and a great grip."
5,"Simple Item, Countless Uses","I originally purchased this skimmer to use as a tool to remove the inevitable scum that rises to the surface when making stocks and broths. For this purpose, it works extremely well and is a good value when compared to say, other skimmers (such as All-Clad's). I also discovered that it could be used to sift flour in a pinch, or to remove meats from soups (and oil). Overall, I'm happy with the purchase."
5,Loved it!,"This book had so many great ideas for making my wedding unique. They are simple and feasible to create, but be prepared to be crafty or have someone you know who is crafty help you."
5,Modern and unique,"This book really helped in planning my wedding,it was fun and inspirational. There's alot of information on doing things more interesting and unique versus traditional. Out of all the books I acquired for my wedding planning this was by far my favorite."
3,Good buy,My family liked the Flying Daggers and Crouching Dragon movies the best of the four pack. More action in the aforementioned - Memoirs of a Geisha was a good story but I like the other movies much better.
4,Barnyard Horse review,"Great product. I bought this for my friends little boy. He loves it! It is extremely durable, he is teething and chews it constanly and it still looks fantastic. If purchasing it for someone under two, just make sure to remove the TY tag."
4,"Derailers ""soldiers of love""","These guys just seem to get better with every CD that they release, a lot of the tracks on this one are like a throwback to the 50s rock n roll music but with a twist of country, in fact this CD would be idea to play at a party the music certainly gets you tapping your feet, a good CD all round and I would recommend it."
3,Derailers derailed,Can't put my finger on it but this is not what I've come to expect from this great band. It's boring and it's far short of their previous recors.
2,I miss Tony!!,"I am a long-time Derailers fan but can't listen to them since the departure of Tony Villanueva. Don't get me wrong, Brian Hofeldt is a talented singer and is very charismatic but without Tony it just doesn't work for me."
4,Derailers - Soldiers of Love,"This is my first Derailers album. I had heard of them before, but never really wanted to buy an album. I think I've been missing out on a great band!Derailers' ""Soldier of Love"" is good - really good - I'm tempted to give it 5 stars but that'll be determined if I'm still listening to this 5 years from now. For now though, this is great ""Americana"" music. This is what real music is about. This is where country music started, where it has evolved to, and it's nice to see how it can still sound good in the year 2006.The songs are really good throughout - start to finish. The lyrics and choruses are very catchy without being cheesey - except for the ""Get 'Er Done"" song - That phrase is so played out by now, you'd think they'd have known better.This album takes honky tonk, country, rockabilly, and mixes them all together to make a great album. It's a record for good times and cold beer. It's nice to hear real good, quality ""country"" music every once in awhile."
1,What a big disappointment,"I just saw the Derailers at the Beat Kitchen in Chicago. I was so excited to finally be getting to see this great band. Well the band I saw was ok, but they should change their name because they are no longer the Derailers. These guys were pop-country want-to-bes with little remaining style, wit, humor, emotion or those beautiful harmonies I truly grew to love. I left before the show was over. I'll keep playing the albums I have because they are top notch, but as far as I am concerned the Derailers no longer exist."
4,A sensitive look at people who find love at different ages,"Have you ever had a book come along that you were ""meant"" to read? This past summer I saw Shadow Ranch at my local book store and bought it because I knew that it would be about life in Southern California, where I've always lived. It turned out to be the perfect book for me. I had just started a relationahip with an ""older man,"" and along came this book about love and life and more importantly hope. A mature love affair can be a wonderful thing"
1,"Sounds good, but doesn't entertain...","This toy claims that it will roll back to the baby when it is pushed away. It will sometimes slowly rollback, but probably 75% of the time it doesn't. Our baby will occasionally push it, but it holds her attention less than a play ball that can be picked up and rolled.It is more durable than I would have expected despite being bounced on. The idea is good, it just needs to be better implemented."
3,an ok toy,"I got this at a consignment sale thinking it would be a fun toy for my son. The only thing he really likes to do with it is climb over it, which isn't the safest thing to do in my opinion. I will give it props for being durable."
4,Another good album by a great singer and writer.,"I have all three of his albums and this one I confider to be more jazzy and romantic. I still cannot believe that Rahsaan is not known worldwide because he has great singing and song writing skills that is being ignored. I wish that a major record company will take notice and sign him up. I love to hear him sing and always will. Some of the other male artists out there, don't have half the talent he has and they are making big bucks and well known. Rahsaan's music is real music that I can listen to all day. I am spreading the word about this Artist."
5,Awesome Artist!,Im huge fan of Rashaasn Patterson.His voice is amazing and the musicon this cd just rocks!
5,Aural enchantment!!!!!,"To say this is a great album, in my opinion, would be an understatement. I have noticed that RP is one of the most consistent singer/songwriters in recent memory. He does his musical progenitors proud (i.e. stevie wonder). I hope he finally will get the widespread reverence he deserves."
5,Great Artist Rahsaan Patterson,"This guy is an amazing talent. The best song I've ever heard is ""April's Kiss."" The whole album is amazing from top to bottom. Rahsaan's self-titled debut and this cd are really close and that's saying something cuz that cd is like nasir jones first cd ""illmatic."" Instant Classic. This cd could be compared to what ""stillmatic"" is in comparison to ""illmatic."" Everyone should buy all of Rahsaan's cd's. Platinum! nothing less for this dude.My top 51.) April's Kiss2.) Don't Run So Fast3.) Forever Yours4.) The Best5.) Yeah Yeah Yeah"
5,SO HOT!!!,"Literally, I listen to all three of Rahsaan's CD daily while at work. I remember watching him on 'Kids Incorporated' some years ago in the '80's. He was an proformer then, not only can he sing his is a excellent songwriter as well. We have been listening to his work for years but did not know it, Rahsaan I love your work. I can't wait for the next CD, I know it will be just as HOT as 'After Hours'.M.Cobbs"
5,NEVER MAKE US WAIT AGAIN,"I will make this simple and plain, this guy is great. Pick any album that he has released, and u wont be sorry. (unlike USHER AND JOHN LEAGEND)."
3,Does not fit narrow blade holders,"The item itself is OK, but it is not really ""universal"" and will not fit the more narrow blade holders. I can't really say this this is not a replacement for my vehicle since it may have had the original blade holder assembly replaced at some point in time. Not entirely surprised that it didn't fit, and not worth going through the return process."
1,Not Universal Enough,These blade refills would not fit in my stock C5 Corvette. They are too wide to fit in the blade holder.
3,Not what I expected....,"I heard this CD descibed as being haunting, and enchantingly beautiful. Well, if you like a lot of electric backdrop, then maybe it would be, but personally this sounded fake to me, and lacked the quality I had expected. I'd reccommend Afro-Celt in replacement to this. This is altogether bland, as far I hear it."
2,There is a reason Amazon's used copies are selling for one cent!,"I saw this book while browsing Amazon. I'm a big fan of autumn craft and holiday books, so I ordered a copy used. First, be warned this is one of those SMALL books (perhaps 6.5 inches) with LARGE text, there is a craft per page with a photo of a suggestion on how the craft should look. The instructions are general and not detailed and contain no patterns. The photos are mostly cute, but the crafts really are only so-so. The tail end of the book contains a few recipes written in paragraph form. The recipes are simple and unchallenging. Overall verdict? 2. stars. I doubt I will make anything from the book, and anticipate donating it to the library in the near future. Disappointing."
1,Don't bother not even worth a rating,"Love ME, but this book is a big disappointment. The very few items were ugly..and so few it was a waste of money. Wonder why it was even published...."
1,Permatex is worthless!!,"We tried Permatex plastic tank repair on our fresh water tank on our travel trailer. We followed the directions, even let it set up for an extra day. The tank still leaked and the patch peeled right off. WORTHLESS!!!"
5,Loved this book as a child,"I read and reread this book many times as a child. The idea of having a magical pet who'd been revered by the Egyptians was enthralling to me. I also loved the way the main character finds out how to use her powers and what will happen if they're misused. In the same way that Harry Potter does, Witch Cat makes you wait and hope for the day you find out about your witchcraft abilities. A charming read."
3,a cat teaches a girl how to do good,"This is a book about a cat assigned to teach Gwyneth, a young skeptic of a girl, that she is in fact a ""witch"". The story is amusing, as the cat does magical things which the girl then tries to explain scientifically. The most important part of the book was the girl's steady realization that she could see the good part that is in all people, and that if she had magical powers, that she must use them to bring that good part into clearer focus."
5,"A readable, must-have handbook!","A great book, no matter what your area of emloyment or study! Everyone who is interested in better neighborhoods and friendlier living within communities should read this book. It's easily accessible, upbeat, and totally practical. This slim volume offers wonderful soloutions to problems that face every community. I would recommend it to anyone, and have given it as gifts to several people I know. (I'm secretly hoping that there will be a follow-up to this book.) This is really a book you will be glad you've read!"
2,Not a great book,"This book ignores much of the urban research (and all of the research that stands against the author's p.o.v.) about what it means to design, build and live in cities."
1,Easy set up?,"Mine must just be crap out of the box - It seems easy enough to set up yet connects to only another access point print server (when lucky - Netgear, this one was a piece of cake) not the network router/ wireless/ Internet (also Netgear Rangemax Next Gigabit)"
2,Very unreliable unit.,"When the WN802T works, its great. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to work very often. My first one died completely when about 6 months old. This was replaced by Netgear under warrenty, then the replacement died another 3 months later. That was replaced also under warrently, and the third one is now started to act-up, disconnecting and needing resets for no reason.If you search the NetGear support forums there are a number of folk reporting similar experiences - seems like there is a basic design issue with the WN802T."
2,Mine failed also,Mine worked fine for about 5 months then failed suddenly. I have not sent it back yet - probably will not bother based on the number of people reporting failures.
2,Like many others this thing just died.,"I've had two of these the first one just stopped working one day so we got another. (A fluke, right?) The second just died. Less than 6 months old and it's scrap. During the time that it worked, I loved it. Unfortunately, it's too expensive to consider disposable. Also unfortunate is the lack of a comparable product."
2,Another double failure,"I purchased my original WN802T in Sept 2006 which failed April 2007. Netgear advanced shipped the replacement (cost me about $17). The replacement failed around Nov 2007. Luckily I also have the WNR834 which is the router version which keeps plugging away. However, I like the flexibility of the access point better. Will try my luck at getting Netgear to replace the second failed unit also"
1,This access point is unreliable,"We were using this access point at work since it's advertised as being capable of handling a ""small business network."" It works solidly for about 2 months and it began loosing connection once a week then progressively dying everyday at about the 7th month before even power cycling won't start it up. I received a replacement and that died in less than half a year. Nothing was done to have the product replaced again. If you want an unreliable product that could last give or take a year, go ahead. Expect to be disappointed."
1,NETGEAR WN802T 200,"This product has given me absolutely nothing but trouble, and NETGEAR support has spent over 20 hours on the phone giving me assistance in setting it up. At best the access point usually causes a limited access wifi signal, but I always receive better range and a more reliable signal when I do not use the access point. The product required hours of NETGEAR's GEARHEAD support team to set up the access point, and it has never provided any useful function. The product I received is either defective, or NETGEAR should no longer sell the product."
2,Great -- when it works,"This device worked as promised with easy setup when I first got it in October 2006. Less than wo months later, it quit working. No internet throughput wireless or wired. Customer service returned via RMA -- I had to pay to return, but all worked. For a while. Just quit again this summer and waiting customer service OK to send back. They seem to be taking longer this time???Looking to buy something else to replace since this cant' be counted on when needed."
2,Not even a year,Purchased the access point in January of 2007 and it failed November 2007. The access point worked find until its last day. But I expect more then 11 months of service from wireless network products.
2,Ehhh.,"On the first use the inside plastic sheet split. I can use it a second time, but after that I will have to remove the plastic.Definitely would not stand up to machine washing as I only hand washed it and it fell apart. Still did a good job on the wood floors."
1,Don't buy this version,"This book is from a company that's sent someone to New York's City Library to photocopy this book (I can tell from the imprint on it with ""New York City Library"" on the page), only the person they've sent for this one may have never operated a photocopier before because several pages the text is skewed because the person moved the page before the copy was finished.I accept that out-of-print books might be missing a few pages. However all the errors with this are done at the time of copying. The index also is completely impossible to read.I found out that this book is available FOR FREE to download on-line anyway."
3,Saga Assortment Gives a Flavour of the Genre,"This short volume provides a good introduction to the area of Icelandic Saga literature. Centring around Hrafnkel's Saga, but including six other bite-size tales, the style of writing may be a little dry for some tastes. However, for me, the plain-speaking narrative reflects a harsh way of life on the North Atlantic island. The action revolves around individuals, their families and followers, and reveals a surprisingly political edge to early life in Iceland. It is not a case of epic plots - the issues are at a personal level. These tales were recorded for a later audience , perhaps as salutory tales - instructions, not just stories. The characters are often abrupt in word and deed, but I found this a refreshing, and often amusing, change from less prosaic fantasy adventures - after all, these are (mostly) real people, and real life. This book encouraged me to read more sagas, and I haven't been disappointed."
4,Intimate musings,"Donald Hall continues to share with the reader his pain of loss, the loss of his beloved Jane. Many of the poems are similar to the prose/memoir he wrote of her. His pain is palpable and intimate."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MOVIE OR RENT IT!,"THIS MOVIE HAS TO BE THE WORST CAR MOVIE EVER.ALL THE CARS ARE STOCK!SCION XB - STOCKHONDA S2000 - STOCKHONDA CIVIC - STOCKMAZDA 3 - STOCK1995 BMW 525 - STOCK (WITH A M5 ENGINE?, SIKE)REGARDLESS OF BUDGET, IT IS NOT THAT HARD TO GET SOME TUNED CARS IN A MOVIE."
2,Cheap cheap cheap,Agree with the last review - except I got 2 or 3 good uses out of it. Cracked and rusted with mild use. May as well get the disposable pans.
2,Not what I had expected,I looked a lot for bread pans this size. They have a strong odor of tin and I was afraid to use them as they might spoil the bread. I did not return them but was disappointed with the quality.
1,potential danger to your health,"I have returned this product and stated the reason that this product may be a danger to your health, please check your file."
4,Its works,"Purchased for a 15 year old Nissan Silvia/240sx which passenger side door lock failed. Install was fairly easy, you just have to look at what you want to do, read the included paper and get to it. Only issue was that i had to cut the wires of the actuator and the car, even though there were female and male parts on both wires the metal contacts were not long enough to meet when fitted. So you will need a wire cutter/knife and electrical tape. Door locks and opens like new now."
3,no directions,"There were no instructions provided. If it were not for the internet, this would have been a substantial problem."
1,CHEEP USELESS CRAP PRODUCTS AVOID THE TROUBLES,CHEEP USELESS CRAP PRODUCTS AVOID THE TROUBLES DID NOT WORK FROM DAY ONE REALLEY POOR QUALITY TOO JUNK ITEMS
5,Rogers Electronics,"This product it very good. No problems on installing it. But make sure you have enough space between the door lock and the door panel. Take your time and make measurements! Trust me if you do it, it will be well worth it. Also you might wanna buy an extra one just to have a back up. By the way, if any of you need the wiring diagram using relays please ask me. No charge: hit me up via email on r.roger37@yahoo.com I will respond promise."
4,Great product,The actuator worked fantastic and was simple to install. It shipped really quick too. I would buy this again in a heartbeat if I need to do another power lock.
5,awesome deal,"actuator works great, awesome when you consider the price,used one to create an electrically operated latch on my trucks bed mounted toolbox"
3,"Works, quality is suspect.",Works! Had to re-engineer the mount slightly to stop binding. Actuator used on ARE pickup bed cover (identical part # as OEM). Quality does seem to be just what it is - Chinese.
2,Bullet Boys - 'Za Za' (Warner Brothers),"Not nearly as good as either of their prior efforts,their self-titled debut or 'Freakshow'.The only two cuts I even thought were somewhat worthwhile are the opener ""When Pigs Fly"" and ""Cross Top"".The band's big mistake might've been to put not one,but two cheezy ballads on here,their third album.""Sing A Song"" and ""Mine"" are not good.I've always thought as the Bulletboys to be sort of like a David Lee Roth rip-off anyway.Still,a good band to catch live."
1,Can't use Shuffle lanyard when using this skin.,"What this product description doesn't mention is that you must use the included Speck USB cap when using the Skin Clear. The ball-bearing mechanism of the standard Shuffle USB caps do not engage when the Skin Clear is installed on the Shuffle. Since the Speck USB cap does not have a lanyard string, you're out of luck if you use the lanyard as I do."
1,Introduces Noise,"You have to use the Speck USB cap if you use this skin, and it introduces noise to my iPod Shuffle, which I hate very much. It's good protection but you've got to give up some audio quality for it...."
3,The story's fine...But the writing needs improvement,"This book was fairly readable, however, I found it to be rather irritating. Although I just stepped foot into my twenties, I prefer to read a novel that sounds as if a mature adult wrote it. For example, the author used the word ""she"" as a sentence opener for nearly a whole chapter. The repetitiveness made the book feel as if a high schooler wrote it instead of a college graduate. Yet, I did appreciate how she included scriptures into the chapters to show how the Bible encourages and guides us through all situations."
3,Issues,"HE'S FINE...BUT IS HE SAVED? is the story about three single sisters in Christ, Michelle, Sandy and Liz. Sandy is a new Christian and she is looking for her husband. Patience is not her strong suit, and she finds herself falling for whatever a man has to say. Michelle is still nurturing a broken heart. When she runs into her ex, she is traveling back down memory lane. Liz was raised by a single mother who poisoned her against men and their ways. Each woman will have to learn to lean on their faith in order to get to the next phase of their lives.HE'S FINE...BUT IS HE SAVED? by Kimberly Brooks has been on my shelf for many, many years. I love the prayers and the way the word of God is shared, but the story itself is predictable, condemning and nave. The characters lack uniqueness, as they all sound exactly the same and the women's desperation was just too much for this reader."
5,"""All that...plus""","This book was ""all that""...entertaining, funny, and thought-provoking...""plus"", it was full of surprises to keep you wanting to read the next chapter right away to find out what happens in the three young ladies' lives. Written very well and very real. Just finished it and passed it on to my young twenty-something niece!!! A definite must read for single ladies at any age, but especially the 20's crowd."
2,Don't Bother,This book was not all that great and it definitely was not comparable to a Victoria Christopher Murray novel. If you want to be bored out of your mind then buy this book.
5,awesome!,I loved this book....waiting on God is what we all must do for it is so worth the wait. I honestly felt like the characters were my friends...Christian ladies supporting each other. I love it!
2,Just ok,"This book was ok, I typically read Christian fiction but think I was looking for a little more, it was short an predictable."
5,Good!,I really enjoyed this book because it was realistic. If you are a single christian women you should read this and even if you are not you will still like it.
4,So Real,This was a great read! I think this book would be a great read for women in the church! It is a great book about being Saved & Dating!
1,Rigid and outdated psychotherapy method.,"This book offers a description of how the author conducts psychotherapy. I hope there aren't many people following his guidelines; they are rigid and off-putting. The therapy situation should be a collaborative effort, not one in which the therapist is all-powerful, all-knowing and over-controlling. If I met my therapist on an elevator and he aknowledged my presence by closing his eyes and concentrating on his breathing, I would not make it all the way to his office. Much better books on psychotherapy are The Heart of Psychotherapy by George Weinberg and On Being a Therapist by Jeffrey Kottler. Read these instead. I'm sending back Back to One."
5,"Fun, useful, a reminder of old times","I love this map! I'm so glad to see it on Amazon.In the early 90's I moved to Chicago, where this uniquely detailed map helped me learn my way around my new city. You can't understand Chicago without understanding its neighborhoods, and this map is the best way to learn how this great city fits together.Now that I live in California, this map is a reminder of the many happy times I spent in Chicago: a friend I met in Ukrainian Village, a girl I dated in Bucktown, the many Cubs games I watched in Wrigleyville, and so on. I can even see the south-side birthplace of my great-great-grandfather.I even enjoy the little mistakes: this is a hand-drawn map, not a cold computer-generated map, and tiny errors and corrections add to its quirky charm without diminishing its utility.If you live in Chicago, or if you used to live in Chicago, this map is a treat! I'm buying my second copy and framing it."
3,Love Mr. Brightside,"I bought this because I love Mr. Brightside so much, but I find the rest of the album just OK. I usually don't listen to the last few songs at all. I like the newer Killers, I think. I love their new album; Battle Born. I've listened to this one at least a dozen times, thinking it will grow on me, but I just don't think I like the style of most of the songs. I do like the first 6 songs better than the others."
1,don't buy it,"I was very excited to get this rack, So I bought it less than 2 months ago, it was on my car for just a month and it is already started to rust!!!"
5,A wonderful product!,"I received this steamer as a gift from my sister. I love it! I especially love that you can add your own herbs/spices in the spice basket. I have cooked all sorts of vegetables with it, with great results. However, I think the most surprising use (for me) was hardboiling eggs. I did not have one egg crack, and the shell just peeled off so easily when they were cool. I will never boil eggs again!"
5,Fun,I purchased two of these for grandaughters who draw and they both loved it. They are 11 and 12 and this was age appropriate.
1,DId not capture my son's interest,We bought this book because my son was interested in cartooning and doing a fair amount of cartoon drawing on his own. He flipped through it but had no interest in reading / drawing along.
5,Lifts your spirit!!,I just loved this book. The stories that Joseph Marshall shares are spiritually lifting. Reading it brought a smile to my face. I enjoyed the simple life lessons that are expressed in the book.
5,Wisdom Is The Goal,"Mr. Marshall has alot of thought in a small book here. From his walks with his grandfather to the questions of life and death. Wisdom and right action should be the goal of our lives. We spend too much time fighting to get ""stuff"" we think we need... How do we treat our elders who have cared for us as children? How do we treat eachother and the earth?The lakota views of life, death, and wisdom makes alot of sense to me at least. The CD that comes with the book is Mr. Marshall speaking these wisdom stories.. I really enjoyed the book and CD very much. It made me remember my own childhood and the time spent with my own grandparents. They taught me alot too, and years later the simple wisdom of their teachings shine true still. This would make a good gift for young adults I think.. Enjoy the stories and the teachings!"
5,Loved the book and the CD!,I was looking for something that accounted for Native Indian life/culture and not through a white person's research. The book was easy to read and I really enjoyed the CD that came along. In the author's voice he explains why he wrote on several of the topics he chose. He also went further into some explanation of the ideas behind some Lakota teachings.
4,Wajnryb should have her word processor washed out with soap.,But this book is one f***ing good read!
4,LOVE the show---disappointing DVD.,"I love this show.BUT... For the price of the DVD I expected alot of behind the scenes...gag reel, more deleted scenes, cast interviews, bios...All the typical ""extra"". There are only a few disappointing deleted scenes. This is by no means a fun ""fan"" type of DVD.Again...I love the show..I am a fan. But the Dvd could have given a little more, especially considereing it was $[...] bucks."
2,Short series,"Very expensive considering how short the series is. Also, I find it hard to believe that the three main characters would be friends in real life. Nico and Wendy's friendship is believable but Victory is just too immature and irritating to watch at times."
2,Not Sex in the city!,"I was boosted to watch that women serie, I was deceived cause series like it (Sex in the City) was so well done compare to this one that's not as interesting. It's entertaining but not credible, could'nt rely on the character's life."
1,Horrible series,"The worst of the Women's Murder Club, Cashmere Mafia trio and the only one to survive. Incredible."
4,An absolutely fabulous re-telling of a remarkable life...,"Joan Fontaine's re-telling of her own life is a riveting book for any movie enthusiast to enjoy. As she talks of her childhood, her infamous rivalry with her sister, and her many movies and love affairs, the reader gets the sense that Miss Fontaine is not only a fabulous actress and a beautiful woman, but also a fabulous and beautiful human being."
3,Just needs to be loaded correctly,"I wanted an alternative to the throw away plastic pods, the ""My Pod"" will not be it. Results so far have been very weak and watery cup of coffee. The first ounce from the machine is almost all water. I would keep looking...L. Edwards has the right idea, the trick seems to be getting the needle to pierce the Pod. The trick is inserting the pod so it is tight against the hole in the cap. I just wish the instructions made it more clear."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This has got to be one of the most stupid books I've ever started to read. It wasn't even cleverly bawdy. It seems as if the author thinks she's a literary giant by using the ""F"" word at least once, but usually more, on each page. She and her cohorts must have put this book together in a couple of hours. Certainly there is no substance to speak of. To sum it up...White Trash."
4,Its worth buying this book,It dishes the dirt of the celebs up in the air. She could have added more pictures of the stars she flew with but overall its very easy reading. An avid reader will have the book finished in no time.I am sure some of the stars got their lawyers involved after this was printed.
2,An exercise in vulgarity,"If art is an indiscretion against oneself, then this book is certainly artful: Ms. Benson admits to things most of us wouldn't tell a twin soul. Spitting in passengers' drinks, expelling fetid gas in their faces, screwing them in toilets in order to score concert tickets - these are the sort of things Ms. Benson not only admits, but celebrates. This is a great book for the Beavis and Butthead set; everyone else, you can buy a whoopee cushion for less and get the same effect."
1,Awful,"This stuff made me sicker than a dog. Heart palpitations, shaking, insomnia, frequent urination, dry mouth, headache, irritability, confusion. If you read around the internet, which I did after I took it, unfortunately, all of these side effects are common."
5,It's So Awesome.,It's So Awesome. The Movie Starts When We See The Little Drummer Boy Named Arron Playing His Drum To The Baby Jesus. Then One Of The Three Wise Men Named Melchior Told Him That He Was Going To See A Friend Of His A Man Named Simeon. Then We See Simeon At His House Looking At The Little Cute Silver Bells. Then He Looked At The Big Silver Bells. Then There Was A Knock On The Door. And It's The Tax Collecter. And He Demanded Simeon To Pay His Tax's. Until He Discovered The Silver Bells. Then The Tax Collecter And His Men Took The Bells Away. Then We See Arron With The Donkey And The Cute Little Lamb And The Camle. And One Of The Wise Men Melchior Is Riding On The Camle.

5,JERRY McCAIN - This Stuff Just Kills Me,This is the best album of Jerry McCain - it contains his best records ever. Thanks to the accompanying musician and the producer - there is no remakes - just fantastic performance on the contemporary level. It's Great Blues Music.
5,Oldie but goodie,"The book is quite old, but very good for those involved with or contemplating getting involved with TEE. I recommend it."
1,iinstrument technation retired,I am sorry to disappointing you due to the fact that the product received was not what i think i ordered. I do have a GM C 1984 sierra 1500 Canadian build. It has a straight block 6 cylinder 250qi motor. I have received a dist.cab and rotor kit for a 8 cylinder motor. The electronic ignition system on top of the cab is also required. How can you help me out with this problem.
4,Coin rolls,They are coin rolls and work fine for rolling coins and work great with rolling machines (I am using with a Royal Sovereign manual coin sorter).
3,sub standard product,was pleased on how fast it arrived but coin roll papers oversized. didn't feel like dealing with amazon or vender tired of the hassle I will not order from amazon or from the vender in te near future
4,formed wrappers,I bought these as a gift to go with the coin sorter for my grandson. They came as described and on time
1,Not the Best,"The wrappers come neatly boxed and organized, but they are not normal spec. They are a bit oversized so the coins tend to move around in the wrapper even when fully closed. They don't really fit well in my automatic sorter either. I would not recommend this brand of wrappers since I have bought other brands at the same relative cost without this being an issue."
4,it works,"can't really complain. we needed some coin rollers for the several hundred dollars in coins we had sitting in a jar. they seem to be of decent quality. didn't tear. held the coins until we got them to the bank. no problems, no issues. I'm happy"
1,dollar store item,"Same exact coin rolls at the dollar store but they are packaged by N.F. String & Son Inc. The package contains 36 wrappers for $1.00. 6 packages=216 wrappers= $6.00. Wrappers for machines or by hand, exactly the same wrappers."
3,Not sure how to seal them once full,Maybe it's common sense but I could not figure out how to seal the paper tubes after I filled them. Maybe you are just supposed to fold them over but that kind of defeats the purpose.
5,My husband loves it!,"I purchased these for my husband to go with the coin sorter I purchased for him. He loves them. They send so many in the package, he'll have enough to last for a long time."
5,Love 'em! Pre-packed as cylinders with one end stopped for easy,Pre-packed as cylinders in the box with one end curled up to stop coins from passing straight though so they work perfectly with Royal Sovereign sorters! Simple and well made!!!!
4,Foxy socks,"Quite stylish and comfortable, almost feels like wearing nothing at all (stupid sexy Flanders). However this sock pills REALLY easily, even if washed inside out, so you may want to use the most delicate setting on your washer and dryer, or even handwash and air dry if you're really particular about it."
3,A bit thinner than expected,"I know the instructions say not to wash or dry on high heat, but in practice that can actually be pretty difficult. They shrunk significantly when washed in cold water with some jeans, and in a dried on medium heat. They still fit though.I also found the wool to be thinner than expected, and honestly not any warmer than regular cotton crew socks."
2,Heathered Rib Sock - Men's Taupe poor quality,"Purchased these socks 6 months ago. After light use, I have started see serious fraying in the heal, to the point of a hole developing. I have probably washed and wore these socks a dozen time since purchase. My other Smartwool socks have held up perfectly. But this model of smartwool socks has a definite quality issue. I cannot recommend this model. For the $16 purchase price, I would have expected a better product."
2,Not really worth the extra cost,"These socks are not worth the cost, compared to Gold Toe. They did not last any longer than any other sock I've tried. So, back to Gold Toe for about 1/3 the cost."
5,Hot Foot,These socks are quite warm and comfortable. I have worn these for several years and will continue to buy them.
5,Ideal Socks,"These are virtuous socks. That is, they are excellent in the activity of socks. Not too thick, not too thin. Warm in winter, cool in summer. Color, fit, comfort... Made in USA (alas, from imported yarn, but still). They last for years. By far my favorite socks."
3,A bit misleading,"Whilst this is a lovely book for a beginner, I fail to see what is ""organic"" about stringing Pearls, Crystals, Beads together. Simply calling a Bracelet made of glass, silver, crystal beads ""Desert Blooms"" does not make it organic! It should have been called Mixed Media as it does do a good job of showing you Polymer Clay, some river stones and glass work. THe majority of the Organic looks are achieved from Polymer doing what it does best - imitating nature. THe book is nicely set out, clear instructions and supplies list. I was expecting this book to be on using Organic items such as Twines, Seeds, Pods etc. A bit misleading, however I am still happy I purchased it."
3,Pretty but Complicated,"This book is fun to look at, and the items are quite involved. Not exactly what I wanted from the title. These pieces are complicated, and use expensive beads, etc. I will look at it from time to time, but cannot get any real practical instruction from it."
1,"Oh, please","I just had to write a brief review, seeing as how this album had nothing but five-star reviews. Of course, my negative review will inevitably be declared as ""not useful"" to others who disagree with me. Fine. However, let me say that not everyone thinks this album is fantastic - or even good, for that matter. Just because a person has decent talent in playing an instrument does not give him a license to churn out shameless muzak like this, and that's EXACTLY what this is - vapid, meritless muzak. If that's your thing, fine, disagree with me and say this review is useless. I say YOUR MUSIC is useless. I understand that the term ""jazz"" is a large unbrella under which many sub-genres can find shade, but this is not jazz in ANY SENSE. This is ultra-safe, elevator background fare."
3,Could be labeled better,"I bought these by accident, a few months ago. I assumed (my mistake) that since India Tree made natural food coloring/dye free decorating sugar (which we love) that these would be dye free as well but they weren't.**I cannot attest to their taste, however, as we did not try them**"
5,Brilliant Bernstein,"Much criticized at the time, especially for the libretto, this one full length opera by Leonard Bernstein today seems brilliant and almost prescient in its subject matter. A great cast conducted by the composer makes the most of the gorgeous music A must for anyone who loves modern America Music or Bernstein's great Broadway scores."
4,AMAZING DEBUT,"Released in 1976, this was the breathtaking debut by RAMONES. The album has fourteen songs compressed in only 29 minutes, using some of the silliest and dumbest achords ever played in a guitar. But the result was grandious, fantastic. You can sense the nergy flowing around, giving you pleasure every second. A true classic for the rest of mankind.."
4,Look's good,"Look's good, Fit's good.Only problem is the velcro that is comes with to install has a white backing and in daylight can be seen through cover.Buy some black velcro and your good to go."
2,Too dark,"During the day these shades look real smooth. However, at night I have people flashing their lights at me all time and telling me they cant see my truck. People will also ride right up on you because they can't see you. I researched lens covers for over a year and I recommend going with a light tint job."
4,BigFamilyBound,"Great recipies. However some can be a little involved and more gourmet then a busy family has time for. But the recipies we do try, are excellent. If you are low-carb, or have Insulin Resistance this book would be a nice addition to your kitchen."
5,This is really a good low carb diet book,This is for really really low carb eaters.I do some carbs but this book helped me choose what's lowest.
1,Lucha Libre Movie,"I received the video right away as promised. The only problem is that the video would freeze on the fourth match and that was very frustrating. I tried it in a different dvd player and it did the same thing. I asked if I could get a better video, but never received an answer from the seller."
5,"If you blush, you need this brush","I would not be able to do blush without this brush, now that I have used it. The angle of the brush is just perfect to obtain beautiful results."
5,grunge deluxe,"If anybody asked me what exactly 'grunge music' sounded like, this is the record I'd play. Mudhoney were there from the very beginning and stood somewhere between Seattle's trashy underground and it's more popular bands. Grunge is about initially wanting to play the cool sounds you love to listen to but realizing that you're not really able to. Or, at least, about being too lazy to keep trying. It's produced by self-proclaimed losers who start to rape musical ideas. You'll find that in perfection on 'Piece of Cake': Noisy lo-fi-songs, nosy lo-fi-vocals and fuzzy guitars, creating some sort of 'garage-rock'n'roll'. They don't use any style-corset. It is what it is. Loud and dirty, but honest. One might call it 'Seattle Soul'. And on this album, Mudhoney found the right mix of fast and slower songs, with a few funny suckerpunches at other music styles, and no filler material. It's their best one."
5,Excellent Meditation,Really enjoyed these guided meditations and got a great deal out of them. Love Doreen Virtue!
1,Limp Writing,"I hate to be hard on any work, but this one was really disappointing. The writing reads like something out of a bad comic book. Sorry, but I just can't recommend this one."
3,Lucky to know,"several of the authors, and have a signed copy. My favorite is the one by A.J. Heard, and I think it will knock your socks off. Bill Brent and Carol Queen also have what I call great stories in this fun and interesting book."
4,Easy to Overlook,"The Everly Brothers got off to a great start on Warner Brothers with a couple of immortal classics in the Cadence mold and if there was a falling off, it wasn't by much. However, you do need to pay attention if you have not heard the material before. Once you do that, it will become clear that the Everly Brothers didn't decline, but just faded in poplularity.Everything sounds great."
1,New Century hymnal,"The church I recently started working for uses this hymnal. And like the majority of our congregation, I don't like it. In taking gender out of some things and using more modern pronouns and other factors, they have destroyed some of the most beautiful poetry. Many hymns that I have known and loved since childhood are either removed from this hymnal or so altered that it is difficult to tell it's even the same hymn. In my humble opinion, ""Dear Lord and Father of Mankind"" shouldn't be altered to become ""Dear God Embracing Humankind."" It just doesn't have the same impact. Neither does ""Nearer My God to You"" in place of ""Nearer My God to Thee."" And don't even get me started on what they did to the Christmas carols. I suppose I can understand the need to change some things, but this is really over the top and overdone."
1,"Old Errors, New Century","I found the textual changes insulting to the original authors of these sacred texts. No regard is given to the biblical language or traditions. Ideology drove the creation of this hymnal, not a desire to glorify God. This is what happens when humans become the center of their faith instead of allowing God's Spirit to speak and reveal God's self to us. For shame.This book speaks neither to the classical nor the orthodox nor the biblical nor the evangelical understandings of the Christian faith."
1,Not the Good Book!,This book changes the texts of traditional hymns in a way that is insulting to the original authors and poets and offensive to musicians. It also does nothing to encourage the creation of NEW hymns reflecting modern language and usage. It probably also plays right into the hands of right-wingers looking for ammunition to use in their hatred of everyone else.
5,Entertaining,This CD definitely catches the era of Star Wars and victory which can also relate to human history. The music of Star Wars has been always popular.
3,Get the vinyl. You won't regret it.,"Not that I'm a vinyl fan or anything like that, BUT... the vinyl sounds far better. I suppose it's due to better EQ and less compression. I have my original vinyl (I've had it for 30+ years!) and the CD version of the album, and there's no comparison, the CD sounds shrill and with no bass. The vinyl is balanced and very enjoyable!"
2,Doesn't Fit my Z3,"Just bought a brand new Z3 and the case I bought from this seller won't fit correctly. Now I have a useless piece of plastic.It almost fits the phone--but doesn't clip down all the way. I played with it for a little while, and realized that the case is either defective or just cheaply made. I've bought these types of crystal cases for all of my phones and usually don't have this problem."
2,The Movie Turned Out Better Than The Book,"The book is too fantastic and unrealistic. It is hard to follow and it is difficult to imagine some of the things that the author writes about. For example, putting bran in the scarecrow's head and saying that he has ""bran-new brains."" I am glad that the screenwriters for the movie were able to preserve the basic story line and produce a much better product."
5,Great for ALL ages,This book was first read to me at age 3. The book was so wonderful that it encouraged me to learn to read at an early age ao that I wouldn't have to stop reading when my parents stopped. This editions illustrations are wonderful and really fit the book well. This book definitely deserves a 5 star rating!
5,Important reading for readers of all ages,A nightmarish cautionary tale of agrarian revolution--complete with a hideous tin ro-bot!
2,"Technically good, but...","Technically speaking, the band is good here (of course, considering the amazibg talent of the musicians involved). But something is clearly missing, the sound is weak, the vibe is not strong, it's like they're playing by the numbers... Buy it only for collection purposes..."
2,Deep Purple- Live in Australia 1999,"Most reveiws are not correct concerning this DVD. While Morse is an excellent guitar player, this DVD sucked! As you would expect, Deep Purple, as it was during this taping, is downright boring! If you are a true Purple fan, you will go back and enjoy Ritchie Blackmore in the older tapings and deal with the 20 year old technology, and enjoy these without hesitation. That was the real and only Deep Purple. No others making up this band will ever compete! I was duped into wasting my money on this DVD by a bunch of wanabee young Purple fans writing reveiws, that obviously can't and will not ever comprehend what Ritchie did for the band. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"
4,I Love Rock & Roll,"The first copy I got was intended to another country, wouldn't play. I figured every copy the store had would be bad. Not so. Had them try out another copy and it worked fine. It just kinda leaves me breathless to watch this show. These guys are great. Much like myself, I'm surprised we are all still around. I can watch this DVD over and over."
5,Blackmore Fanatics,"Just because One member of a band could or choose not to perform with the one of the Best Bands in the World, and Still are..!! Oh yeah man, ive seen Blackmore live with DP..But Stever Morse, is as good as Anyone alive today. Bar none. The ""total"" musician, with some of the greatst musicians together again. What a show? Great production. And at first, it didnt to much..BUT the More you watch it, the More you want It...!! Im renting mine for now...Not for long, that's for sure. Its WELL worth the money, and may well be the Last Deep Purple tour...Who cares if Blackmore could not make it. Morse makes Deep Puprple a Better band actually. BUY IT....SOON....!!"
5,My son loves this!!!,He has Ligtning and Mater and spends every waking moment that he can with them. They even go to bed. My only problem is the not so durable tow hooks on Mater and they should actually work. My son tried to hook them up like he saw on the picture.
1,The retelling of a classic that misses the mark!,"Jane Eyre is one of my favorite classics and I thought that an erotic retelling of Charlotte Bronte's memorable heroine would be an interesting read. I agree with this book's preface about Jane Eyre having some algolagnic and sadomasochistic undertones throughout, but this retelling of Jane's rather interesting discipline at Lowood Boarding School misses the mark. I found it silly instead of erotic, wooden instead of smoldering. What disappointment! The unidentified author's imagination is nowhere near as overactive as Anne Rice's when she wrote the Sleeping Beauty series. I'll stick to the classic novel and its vague erotic implications -- whether they're real or imagined."
1,For Sadists-not purists..,"I was enticed by the opening and disappointed almost immediately after. What a shame. There are so many opportunities within Jane Eyre itself, that i was surprised the author did so little with the huge opportunity placed before him(her). The book is purely for die hard sadists. ""Jane"" herself isn't even enjoying her descent into submission like a good sub-it all smells of torture to me. It was so bad it made me want to write merely to show the author how it should be done."
5,Brilliant work of art:,"OK, I don't see the spot where authors can comment on their books anymore - or maybe I missed it, so I shall review us instead! First of all, the stories are all different, all fun, some touching, & mine (Here Comes Santa Claus) inspired because I was in a grumpy holiday mood. Not everyone is perky at Christmas - I'd been shopping & fighting in line for Pokemon Yellow. So my story tells the tale of two rebel elves who get booted from the North Pole for annoying Santa, and who when pitched together must at last face their feelings for each other. Unfortunately, this results in a planned ambush of the Father of Christmas. (which is pretty much what I planned to do to the Mall Santa myself)"
2,Old-fashioned love songs,"If you like love songs that are tender, music that is dancable, words you can understand, this is the album for you. And, Kathie Lee has an exceptionally pretty voice."
4,Pretty good for chatty Kathie,Kathie Lee has good taste but some of her song choices are so old. The first track is interesting. She probably would do better if she recorded more current stuff. This album makes one sleepy. Her Christmas songs sound alot better!
3,To defensive,"Kathie Lee has a very smooth voice (except for a few high notes). Here she tries to defend her love for Frank. If Frank drops her, there are many guys out there to get her on the rebound. I wish she would sing songs about the happiness of love."
4,coffee,"nice flavor, not as strong as I like my coffee, great aroma, recommend to anyone who likes a little lighter taste coffee"
5,Perfect item for fans of Amazing Stories and Movie and Television Composers,"A must have if you are a fan of Amazing Stories. I grew up with this television show. I ended up purchasing this and the anthology soundtracks 1, 2 & 3 for my husband. He is a musician and composer and loves movie soundtracks. He couldn't beleive how many big name composers were brought in for the series."
4,great performance - OK recording,"The performance is outstanding (would one expect any less from the Philly Orchestra?) But, the recording is just a bit on the dark side. Can't put my finger on it, but something about it sounds ""muted."" Nontheless, I'm glad to have purchased this CD and hoping for more new recordings from one of the best orchestras on the planet."
3,Intruiging sampler slightly marred,"3 1/2Creates a lovely night out with a premier orchestra, albeit in the middle section due to a certain detached quality in the recording. The selections are not earth-shatteringly necessary, but hold plenty of profoundly rendered moments and progresses nicely up to the Bartok centerpiece which does, amidst varying ideas, displays tremendous, if fleeting power."
1,Threads on the handle keeps wearing out,"Do not buy this faucet and shower, I had this for 2 years, and threads on the handle keeps wearing out, replaced the facet twice in two years, but now I need to take out the tiles to put a new unit."
2,Not the best Joao,"Amoroso/Brasil is not really worth buying if you like Joao Gilberto's soft atmospheres ; there is too much orchestration on this record, and it's sad too see that Joao sounds better, much more evocative and sensual when he is alone with his guitar. Better buy Live in Montreux or Voz e violao..."
5,Beauty,"Joao Gilberto (b. 1931) first came on to the scene with his debut album of 1958 titled ""Chega de Saudade"", introducing a new style of jazz samba called bossa nova. Gilberto is credited as the innovator of the bossa nova sound that sprung to life out of Brazil. We all likely own the 1965 classic Getz/Gilberto album, featuring his then wife Astrud on vocals along with Stan Getz and Antonio Carlos Jobim.This album is good to own because you get two albums for the price of one, Gilberto's ""Amoroso"" (1976) and ""Brasil"" (1981). These albums showcase Joao in his prime, vibrant and full of life. ""Brasil"" is a much more accessible album to listen to than the previous selection, and showcases fellow Brazilian musicians Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso. What an album to relax to and forget about life."
5,"Yes, Joao Gilberto Singing","I've heard that Mr. Gilberto, being very shy and a little strange, would not go into the studio for Amoroso, so they went to his house to record and he sang and played in his pajamas. Then Claus came along and added the quite wonderful arrangements afterwards. Perhaps that explains the slight out of synch feel.But when all is said and done there is no other like Joao Gilberto. Joao liked Fred Astaire. Another one of a kind. If you have not heard Amoroso go get it! In 1977 Joao gave a one man show at the Roxy, Sunset Strip plugging Amoroso. Two sets, two days. After the first set the management was begging the audiance to stay free for the second. (Wouldn't that be nice today.) On all four sets Joao's first encore was S'Wonderful ""that you should care for me."" He sang O Pato for me. How he gets to the ""heart of the matter."" What more?"
5,Review of Amoroso/Brasil CD,"This is one Joao Gilberto's best recordings! The clean background orchestrations only enhance the beauty of his voice and these great songs. The highlight of this CD is the Jobim classic, ""Wave."""
4,Dreamy,"Joao Gilberto's sings in a smooth, romantic and sensual way. I love it. Imagine being on the beach, embracing the one you love and listening to his wonderful, dreamy voice."
3,Wishing for Wings,"9-year-old Andrea is a bird lover who wants to fly, so when she sees an ad in the back of her comic book promising working wings, she orders them. She assembles the wings and glues them on her back, and can't get them off. She only tells her brother Jim, her parents are gone and she doesn't trust her Aunt Bets. After drinking some ""Areo-Joy Juice, her wings become more powerful and she can actually fly with them. She practices flying for about a week in secret, when she begins to notice some strange things about her body. She calls the man who makes the wings for help, and decides to see him in his office. But things don't turn out quite the way she expects, and she realizes how she has been trapped...This was a pretty good book. I liked it when I was much younger, though. I think that it is a book for young children, but is still pretty interesting in one afternoon."
2,Disappointing Ending,"The beginning was good, but the ending was disappointing. Why give up something special suddenly instead of figuring out how to keep it?"
2,Please - start taking lessons,"Yngwie needs to expand his playing to include anything other than squeezing notes into holes. His playing lacks structure and timing. While he is an amazing technical musician, there is little else.If you like Yngwie - get the DVD for your collection.BTW, the production is as bad as it gets. Yuch!"
2,"Boring, repetitive and simply rubbish","All YJM can do is play scales over and over and over again. This is one of the most boring showmen on the rock stage. The editing on this DVD is poor anyway. A waste of moeny, avoid."
2,A bad production,I bought this DVD four months ago and I stil don't see all the DVD! The video and sound are awful. If you want to see a nice Yngwie performance with good quality I sugget to try Yngwie's VHS Ricing force 1985.
3,Karate Kid,"I am an absolute fan of Yngwie's music, however I did not enjoy this video as much as I would have liked. I did not feel that the production was all that great and the lighting gave little to be desired. Yngwie's music however was awsome! Not enough of his guitar solo material (which I tend to prefer only). The sound was really good and there were some great angles. Something I did find a little humorous was how Yngwie was doing so many karate kicks, a bit cheasy. Yngwie is the best guitarist though, but not the best stage performer."
2,Not as good as i had hoped,"I had high expectations when i ordered this DVD. I own other music DVD's of other bands (Steely Dan, Stevie Ray Vaughan) and they were all excellent. I've got a...[new] home theatre setup so that really helped to make those DVD's (or any DVD) special. So when Yngwie Malmsteen Live! arrived, i was at first excited to throw it on but once i took it out of the box it came in, i saw the case of the DVD. Looked very budget,... and it just didn't have what i was looking for. Cheesy effects put through to look cool but don't, and Yngwie's kicks, by god the kicks. Someone should tell him not to do that, it makes him look bad for how much talent he has. most of the shots were bad too. No good angles. Now i hate being so harsh with my rating, but this really doesn't compare to other music DVD's I've bought. i would say to most people not to buy this, unless you are just adding to a collection. Not much replay value here. Not much initial value either :)"
4,all in all it is a good buy,"if you are a malmsteen fan, in my opinion, this is a great DVD to have in your collection! i'm a guitarist of 15 years and have went to the school of rock taught by yngwie, vai, paul gilbert, and george lynch to name a few. i also own my own video production co. when not working on music. in my opinion as an editor, the editing is pretty good, i liked it. the angles were good...some video was poor and very grainy.....like the 5th camera guy was using a best-buy bought camera. the sound is really not good: i was disappointed. for yngwie being so picky i'm surprised he let this out. you can hear stuff but it's not really enjoyable...since you ""just hear stuff."" it's muffled and low volume bothers me a lot. overall you will be happy if you want to add a newer video to your collection."
3,Not well put out,"This DVD is not well made. It does not have 5.1 surround sound, no extra material or bio thats usually on DVDS and Yngwies accoustic solo has been cut. I give it 3 stars not on Yngwies performance but on the quality of the DVD."
2,What is up with the audio?,"I can't believe Yngwie Malmsteen would allow such a poor DVD out. The visual quality of this DVD concert is really good, but at times rather cheesy. As for the audio, it is really something to be desired. Not only is it mixed at a terribly low volume, but I can't even hear a seperation within the instruments. I can't believe what I heard. My dad and I recorded a song using a small mic and an MD recorder and it sounds a million times better than this DVD! How can a small mic and MD recorder sound better than the audio mix on this DVD? The answer is quite simple...we have better equipment. In closing, this DVD is a HUGE disappointment. You would be better off buying Yngwie's albums."
3,Cute Book,"This was acute book, but unfortunately wasn't what I was looking for. I thought it was a book about a ""first sleepover"" since the Berenstain Bears generally have the best transition books, but it was more about behaving at a sleepover than anything."
2,Cute but $$?,"Bought this for my wife and it is nice and cute for a lady, yet why did I pay 13 bucks for 3 cents worth of plastic?"
4,Fun game for LPS enthusiasts,"My 6 year old daughter is a LPS enthusiast, so she happily spent her allowance on this game. It comes with 52 cards featuring 13 different pets. There are several variations of the game that can be played depending upon the cognitive ability of your youngster. You can play a memory game by matching 2 cards and turning them over, you can play go fish, or make up your own game. We had no trouble making up several games and playing this for several hours the week she got it."
5,Very attractive watch with the look of casual quality.,"I am completely satisfied with this purchase. My wife likes this stylish, casual watch. A bargain for the $50.00 I paid. Nicely packaged. Makes an major impression when given as a minor gift."
3,Nora Robert's trilogy,"Not really deep but decent story telling with reference to local customs & habits, a no brainer & fast read."
4,One of the pioneers,"Novalis can be seen as one of the very first German poets who abandoned the classic German way of writing. ""Hymns to the night"" in particular is a collection of poems characterised by a mysterious dark lyricism and an accult atmosphere, blended in a way that cannot possibly provoke, annoy or ""puzzle"" ANY reader. On the contrary, Novalis' unique way of writing sounds like ones' beautiful ancient prayer to ones' ancient Gods"
3,love is such a small thing,The poem is translated in English by someone who is clearly pound foolish and pennywise. So much effort is done to stay close to the original text but as a whole it has become a bit two dimensional. The poem itself reads like a profound work that has had and will have always some but not so manny admirers. That is not because it is so difficult or vague. No it's just that time kept this one secret for the grande majeure.
2,Ripoff,"And the major labels wonder why folks have deserted them...$21 for 43 minutes of music is a disgrace, there is a serious error by the violinist, and the sound is just mediocre. I'd recommend you buy the Naxos with Jando and the Kodaly Quartet: good sound, excellent performance(s) - and the Schumann Quintet too."
5,Fantastic Movie,I really enjoy most all of Hayley Mills movies. She started out as a fantastic actor. The only movie I don't appreciate is the Castaways. Horrible little movie. This one was thumbs up though. This movie got her the gig in Pollyanna.
5,Tiger bay,"Hayley mills' first movie, and one of the best.-it was made in england-so, you'll either meed a region 2 player, or a region free player, or look up 'dud duplicators' in the yellow pages and have someone put on a region 1 disk.-an old movie, so it is in b&w. very good anyway!"
4,Pre-Disney Hayley,"In this black and white, early-60's film, we get a rare glimpse of Hayley Mills before her discovery by Walt Disney, as she shares the screen with her actor father, John. She is truly extraordinary as a young tomboy, who gets involved with a fugitive -- natural, convincing, and affecting. And the film itself is well worth seeing for its depiction of her relationship with the man on the lam, played by Horst Bucholz. See this if you can."
4,Tiger Bay Roars,"Directed by J. Lee Thompson who brought you ""The Guns of Navarrone"" and ""Cape Fear"", Tiger Bay is a top notch suspense film. The 13 year old Haley Mills plays a tom boy who sees a murder by Horst Buchholz (""Magnificent Seven""). Of course, the killer sees the little girl who is the only person who can identify him and comes after her.

2,"Burlington, VT. is a turnoff","While Mr. Idle went on tour to some very exciting places (like Montreal, Quebec) Burlington---which has a popultaion of way under 100,000 is a real turnoff. All due respect to Vermonters but his going through Burlington should have gotten a footnotes mention and nothing more. As far as his bad book editing abilities for Burlington and other things.Blame Idle not the publishing company that put the book out. Why should they risk offending a bankable star who wishes to use their company? He could've simply took his book biz elsewhere if they angered him. Away from the other Pythons Idle has little talent of his own as this book proves."
4,I laughed and then I went to the loo,"and then I read this book. The third tallest Python, and the ambiguously charming songwriter, has delivered his blog into book form in order to squeeze every penny out of the punters who Idle-ize him. And it's worth it. Now that he has hit the big time with Spamalot, perhaps something really seedy and scandolous will come out that will shock Cleese, Palin and Jones back into action. And anything that deals with his especially endearing relationship with George Harrison is worth the price. Get this and tix to Broadway and laugh a lot."
5,One of the most enjoyable books I've read in a long time,I laughed out loud at this story of Eric Idle's bus tour for his Broadway show Spamalot. I've sent this book as a gift to several people and insisted they read it.
5,He and his nine men traverse America,"Fans of comedy, especially British comedy, may find both the title of this book - Greedy Bastard Diary: A Comic Tour Of America - and its author strike a bell. Eric Idle is an ex-Python, humorist, and explorer of comedy around the world: in Greedy Bastard Diary he and his nine men traverse America visiting Gore Vidal and the common man alike, enjoying stand-up comedy, and celebrating being part of an American family and British comedy alike. Especially recommended for prior fans of Monty Python's unique brand of humor."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"I love Eric Idle and Python but this book is NOT a pleasure to read. I kept reading it just to be fair to him. I held out hope that it would get better. It never did.While some of his personal accounts were interesting, there's a glut of boring, meaningless details. The funniest part of the entire book was the song lyrics, and most of those were well known Python songs."
4,Not for Python fans only,"This book is part travelogue; part personal journal; part inside-look at the makings of a comedy tour, and part autobiography. But mostly it is just a fun read - infected with that insane silliness you'd expect from Idle.Starting in Rutland, Vermont and ending in Los Angeles, Idle and his assembled crew spent 80 cold autumn/winter days visiting cities in the USA and Canada. The daily routine of the bus trip - the interviews, the theaters & hotels, the pains taken to perfect the act - are all addressed. What really makes this book work though, are Idle's hilarious musings on life, and the stories he shares about his friendships and adventures over the years. Also included are color photographs, the lyrics for some of his songs, and amusing comments added to the margins of many pages."
3,PERFECT CTI SOUND WITH DONALD HARRISON,"It not a perfect Harrison album. Is commercial and light, but perfect to hear in a car in summer, or to listen in a cool party. Harrison always sound well, but now is too easy.Eddie Palmieri, Chris Botti and Chub Loeb play in this record and play well but they no say nothing special. I can't understand this kind of record, but is nice, like all CTI records. Good musicians, making easy music. Is simple but is ok if you are looking for this kind of music.I prefer the ""other"" Harrison, but this is perfect for at good afternoon beyond the sea."
2,Dissapointed,"I was hoping for the repeated brilliance that can be heard on Art Blakey's ""New Year's Eve at Sweet Basil""or the more recent jazz ""Nouveau Swing"" CD.3D is a good cross-over studio CD. Eddie Palmieri and Step in The Name of Love are my only picks for this CD. This is definitely a worth while ""smooth jazz"" CD purchase."
1,This is the stuff of which to be wary!!,"War. Mean rhinos, kind elephants. Conflict that takes the characters (Rataxes and his band, anyway) to the brink of violence...It's fine to anthropomorphize to make a point, and with Babar the point is fine, because he's kind, thoughtful, and peaceful. But the poor rhinos, the treatment they receive here, is pathetic...Please -- pass on this one. Go with Shel Silverstein or other rhino authors. Early Babar books, fine..."
2,Pointlessly beautiful language,"Readers searching for alternatives to mainstream fiction seem willing to accept any crumbs; AVA is a case in point. Maso's language is, indeed, innovative and often quite beautiful. As is often the case with ""innovative"" fiction, however, it goes nowhere. AVA is highly self-indulgent--the writer is everywhere on the page--and this supposed meditation on death and dying seems like little more that the author's excuse to brag about her knowledge of art and literature and drop a few names."
4,"He,s Good Teacher","He is hendry,hank W7UD is his son when i when to clover park tc back in 1985.I learn how to trouble shoot and real good,so i brout thebook"
1,This film is useful for a Good Beating,I never finished this movie. My brother and I took it out back and destroyed it with baseball bats after about 5 minutes of watching it. That's how bad it is.
4,A must have if U have Koi.,"I've got 3 Koi....by accident....swimming in a 55 gallon tank. When I purchased them the fish person @ the store thought they were goldfish :) Over a couple months they morphed into Koi. It didn't seem 2 bother the other 9 goldfish.I bought the book because I'm gonna break ground this winter in the back of my home in The Sierra foothills in CA and give these remarkable fish a fitting place 2 play :)The book has it all. Beautiful pictures, practical section, Koi varieties, and a step by step, blow by blow description including schematics of how to build a Koi Pond."
3,LYNAM IS OK !,This is a good rock n roller. I enjoyed its freshness and yet it harks back a couple of decades here and there. Im glad that I have it in my collection. I also have heard their other releases and this is by far the better of them all. Lynam and Zan Clan kinda go hand in hand except that the Clan has the upper hand and is a band that I would suggest before Lynam.
4,I start my morning...,"Very often, I find myself rocking out to this album as I get ready for the day. I actually enjoy it more than I had expected to. Great talent, a lot of energy to rock out to."
5,Just saw them live...,"I just caught this band live at the HOB in N. Myrtle Beach. They played a short set opening for Candlebox and rocked the place out. I'd recommend them to anyone who likes solid rock. Also, definitely try to catch them live of you can."
3,".....didn't know, still lovin' it....","I haven't listened to this CD a lot (mainly because my sister keeps taking it away; so, she can listen to it), but I know that I like what I HAVE heard. I didn't know that they used the 'n' word... Maybe I just didn't listen hard enough. I think that if it doesn't offend that ONE person, and while listening, they are led to Christ; then praise the Lord.... I once heard a minister say this: ""This world is going to H31l in a hand basket, and you people don't give a D@#n! ... I know this for a fact because you are all more concerned withe second part of that statement, then you are the first."" If God wants to use this group, and the 'n' word, to add to his kingdom, then so be it... I just thang GG's for their ministry. If you aren't offended by the 'n' word, buy this delighful CD....(Words were muffed so this post wouldn't be dropped.)"
3,"My overall Rating for ""I Can See Clearly Now""","Okay, where to begin....Ah, yes. I purchased this CD as I was just getting into Christian music, figuring the album wouldn't have any ""hard words"" like secular rap does. But lo and behold, they had to mention the word ""nigga"". I am white, but I was still shocked and offended by these words, seeing how they're supposed to be Christian artists. They were called to be different too, y'know, live a different lifestyle. What if they had talked about going out and shooting the cops in the name of Jesus? I didn't approve of that very much. Other than that, the lyrics were very personal, very true. The music was original. All except for that one element (that very important element), the CD was great. But I don't listen to it that much anymore."
2,Never thought I'd live to see the day...,"...when a Christian band would have the nerve to put racial slurs on their album. The ""n"" word was used repeatedly in this album, and to be honest, I'm extremely offended. As Christians, we're supposed to view everyone as equals and everyone is the same in the eyes of God. The Gospel Gangstaz have totally demolished that truth in this album.Now, don't get me wrong. The message and music apart from the slurs were totally awesome. Songs like ""I Call Your Name"" and ""Once Was Blind"" are very touching and true (and that's only 2 out of many others). But the fact that they insist on using that word over and over kind of ruined the experience for me.Now, I am keeping this album (because they wouldn't let me return it once it was opened:), but I really would've appreciated a Parental Advisory label or sticker on the cover before I bought it."
4,A Secular Rap/ Hip Hop listener,"I aint gonna lie to kick it. I listen to snoop dre Jay Z Pac and more But Latley I have been looking for some HArdcore true to the heart Hip-hop/Rap without foul language . . . U know a cd u can play around a preacher without being frowned upon. well anyway i bought his Cd and its alright. theres only three tracks that Im Really feelin Track 4, track 11 and track 13. If u do decide to buy this CD, Turn it up. The other tracks are alright. The bass Is kickin and The bottom line is this: If your Just startin out lookin for a christian rap or ur a hardcore christian rap fan heres a good place to start."
1,Not what I expected based on the other reveiws,"I purchased this CD in hopes that it would be spiritually bound, but in my opinion it was not. It seems that most of the songs are about the rappers lives in general, not Jesus. You really have to listen to find out where they mention Jesus or God. I only liked 2 songs on the entire album. I also was very surprised by how much they used the ""N"" word. It also has alot of west coast flavor, which is fine if you are into that. I would not recommend this CD to anyone."
4,Worth Every Penny,"This CD is worth your money, I hear Gang Affiliated is tight also, but its too much money. Certified Trunk Beater"
5,DA BEST RAP EVER ( NO KIDDIN),"THIS CD IS SO HOT. You have to buy it man. Best Christian rap cd ever. Mr. Solo, Tikk Tokk, and Chily Baby are hot in this cd. These guy used to be gangstaz but it is cool that they are Christian now cause then I wouldn't of enjoyed this cd. It has West Coast groove to it. Real gangsta rap. CHeck out #3, I Call Your Name."
3,"Good beats, but not enough Satan","Being THE definitive hiphop encyclopedia that I am, I decided to give this album a try - especially for the fact that I know my Chrisitian Gangsta Rap like no one else in the states.So I checked it out. The beats are pretty hot. Actually, the beats are downright smokin'. Hot fire westcoast sounds. Makes you wanna rob a liquor store, smoke dippers and call up your local neighborhood chickenhead to get your swerve on.The lyrical content is outright garbage though. I mean, the flow is nice, but man - could these guys get any more preachy? I don't wanna hear about Jesus and saving ourselves and heaven and all that.What these guys SHOULD'VE done is bust phat rhymes about sacrifices dedicated to our Dark Lord Kromdor and everything that he represents. Lord Kromdor will save you. He's tight with Satan, so you know for a fact His crew is a tight crew to be representin.So next time Gospel Gangstaz, less Jesus, more Dark Lord Kromdor. Your album will be hot fire!Peace"
3,3 = SOLID,"I was flipping through the channels and came across a 'Christian' video show. GG's video for ""I'll Be Good"" was playing; that was enough for me. I'm not a Christian, but when that song plays, even I have to give it up for the Lord.I have to admit, I was a little embarassed buying a disc by a get-up with such a ridiculous name, but good music is good music.This disc is good. Hip-hop with flavors of R&B and gospel...not a trendsetter or groundbreaking by any means; just a solid listen."
4,OGG's GO ON AND ON AND ON....,"I've bEEN into tHe OGG's since Gang Affiliated and Do Or Die(2 CHritian Hip Hop classics) for tHeir SoutH Central Cartel.NWA-isH style of CHristian Rap,wHicH Has bEEN a trend setter for otHer artists speak on tHe problems on tHe streets...ONLY to provide tHe ANTIDOTE/ANSWER,faitH in tHe Lord Jesus CHrist.

1,Beware,"My husband reminded me to Beware of the ""AS SEEN ON TV"" of course I allowed the kids to talk me into this. It arrived in a package with limited care instructions. I seasoned the pan, then used the oil as suggested, then tried non stick spray. None of these actually prevented the pancake mix from sticking. It was worse when I tried the eggs. The surface is quite bumpy. Just a cheap non stick finish over the Iron which came off almost immediately. I washed as directed, dried and it rusted almost immediately. BUYER BEWARE!I would suggest an Aebleskiver pan (a danish delight now reinvented into the ""pancake puff"")"
4,Atlas Gloves,"Well, it was a gift and she said that SHE liked them,that she always borrows her son's and she was glad to have her own."
1,BOGUS AD,"ATLAS GLOVE CONSUMER PRODUCTS C300L FIT GLOVES LARGE (PACK OF 12)Vendor claims ad error after receiving my ""secure"" data of name, address, phone, credit card number and expiration date, etc. Yet more than 10 hours later there has been no change in ad on Amazon!

4,Works great.,Works just as advertised. Have had no problems with fit or performance with either product.
1,MY RIGHT TO MY OPINION AND MY REVIEW AND WHY I WOULDN'T BUY HIS BOOK NOW,His books are fine if you want Tales of Cape May. There is much more to the Jersey Shore than Cape May. The entire east coast of the state of New Jersey is along the Atlantic Ocean. His books and his Facebook page deal only with Cape May. He talks about spending only a week or so out of a yearin Cape May and lives in Massachusetts. When someone mentioned that there is more to the Jersey Shore than Cape May on Facebook he deleted them for that truthful comment. I have read his posts on Facebook. I was interested in the book until he deledted the friend of mine I mentioned just for mentioning that there is MORE TO THE JERSEY SHORE THAN CAPE MAY. A part of New Jersey where a lof of American History took place.
5,Yo...this music sounded amazing at the ACT 1 show,"Most tracks sound dated now but if U got a chance 2 check out his show or hear a live bootleg copy of the same songs U would see that they kick dragon live. ""God created woman"" is the best track on the cd so buy it yo!"
1,weak,Banging and funky but aside from that this disc is flat.it's diamonds&pearls with beats. same album different sound.
2,O ( + > ......ehhh,"i expected more from this album. many of the songs sound like the same song. and it isn't a good one, either.the best song is ""7"". it is, like, the only song that actually sounds like a real prince song.so, in my opinion, skip this album. download the song ""7"", cuz it rocks. possibly download my name is prince, sexy mf, and 3 chains o gold, but 7 is really all u need.cool cover tho."
5,One Star; What are you nuts?,"Definitely the quintessential Prince CD...great tunes, grooves, production...how does it get better than this? Prince To The MAXX!"
5,Let the Power Fall,"The ""Love Symbol"" release - October 1992 - is sweeping in scope and ultimately a peek into what was scheduled to be a rock (soap) opera, with a number of spoken segments to weave the music into a story. Out of that project remains two short segments that are spoken by Prince and Kirstie Alley.The 18 total tracks clock in at 74:56 and reached #5 on the Billboard 200 album chart. The singles were mostly misses on the hit parade; only the third of five, 7, charted well, reaching #7 on the Billboard Hot 100. There is renewed energy, as Prince travels familiar territory - his distinct rock sound - with elements of funk and hip-hop solidly in the mix.The creativity is incredible and Prince has a winning formula that is a worthy follow-up to 1991's Diamonds and Pearls."
3,"Not quite up to the Replacements---but solid, nonetheless.","O.K.---so Tommy Stinson isn't Paul Westerberg. But there's enough of the Replacements sound here to satisfy most 'Mats fans. With Bash and Pop, bassist and singer Stinson showed that he played no small part in forging the ragged around the edges, yet sensitive, rock and power-pop/punk sound that was the 'Mats calling card. It's hard to believe that he was already a 13-year veteran guitar player at the ripe old age of 26 when this was released. ""Friday Night"" isn't a great album, but it recalls enough of the 'Mats glory that any Replacements fan should enjoy it, yet stands up well in its own right. Also, don't miss Stinson's laterVillage Gorilla Head---also a worthy addition to the post-Replacements body of work."
4,Great Educational CD's,This is a great pack of 4 CD rom's for Kids. Mighty Math teaches basic concepts and problem solving skills. Thinkin' Things is a fun CD that the kids loved. Thinkin' Science teaches scientific reasoning and about the Earth's rotation and gravity. and Kit Pix deluxe has great art and animation projects for kids.
2,Practicing yogi,"First of all, the block may be solid, but not solid wood. It is hollow and made out of plywood. Secondly, it may look good in your home studio, but the top (smallest) facet caved in after 2 weeks of practice. So, if you are ordering it for decoration, it will serve the purpose."
3,buyer should note these blocks are hollow,"the pros are that the blocks are gorgeous and lightweight. the con is that they are glued together planks and I'm concerned about the longevity of this. I live in a dry climate so they may start falling apart after a few years... a traditional block is solid, something you can't tell by the deceptive picture on the product page. I have them now and they are the right size and seem to work so I'll keep them and see how long they last. However I find the hollowness disconcerting when moving them around and will likely look for solid blocks of hard wood in the future (not foam or cork)."
3,"Wow, it was written a long time ago","I had read this book as a child and absolutely loved it! I had thought of it over and over during the years, and finally found it through a search engine. It's a great little book that has a great deal of imagination. It's not the best writing style (it was written in the 80's), but it's a great story."
3,It is all about dollar,A documentary of New Orleans sex industry legal at the beginning of the XXth century (till 1917).Funny original stills and some ideas for busting recent revenue.Not too deep work.
3,Heating pad,"I was looking for a heating pad with auto turn off and thought from description that this was a larger heating pad. It is OK, but it takes awhile before it gets up to desired temp and stays there short time before working it's way back down to off."
3,I think it could be a winner,This is a christmas gift for a neigbor she did not try it out yet but she think its something she woulk like.
3,"Dated, but solid","Before Lords of Acid, they were Digital Orgasm. This is basically the same sound--90's dance music--but without the explicit lyrics. The subject matter is more typical of the genre at the time: Love, Peace and Beats. Not bad, but it sounds dated today."
5,100 % pure inspiration!,"Woow, what can I say? It is all about Chuck Jones!Very inspiring DVD with a great interview and some commentaries from famous people. This stuff is totally inspiring for animators!"
5,An engaging portrait of a wry genius,"I fell in love with Chuck Jones' work way back in the 60's when I was a student at MIT, where the adventures of Wile E. Coyote were followed avidly by the engineering students each week. The warped, surrealistic humor of the Road Runner epics were the perfect antidote to the daily grind of math and physics, and we always rooted for the coyote, even while knowing that he'd never catch and devour the road runner. There's a wonderful subversive quality to much of Jones' work, as this delightful documentary makes perfectly clear. It offers a nice mix of technical tidbits, commentary by admirers from Steven Spielberg to Matt Groening, and wry observations by Jones himself. If you've ever wanted to meet the man who gave us Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Wile E. Coyote, this is your chance!"
3,"Chuck Jones-Extremes and In-Betweens, A Life in Animation","I was somewhat disappointed to find only a snippet of ""The Dot and the Line"" and ""One Froggy Evening"" instead of the entire feature. I have been searching for these cartoons, without success for years and thought I'd finally hit the jackpot. But it was great getting an insight into the genius of Chuck Jones and hearing what other big stars thought of his work. It's a must see for anyone interested in the process of animation."
3,Chuck Jones Deserves More,"Chuck Jones is an amazing director, but unfortunately this documentary is more a ""celebration"" of Jones--the kind of thing you might see at an awards show, only longer and more repetitive--than an in-depth look at his life or work. This DVD isn't worthless. You do get a couple of great cartoons and some mildly-interesting pencil tests. But your time and money would be better spent with Jones' own book (Chuck Amuck: The Life and Times of an Animated Cartoonist) or with the cartoons themselves."
2,bland Victorian Romance.....,"after forcing my way through about 120 pages of this book I finally just gave up. In a word, this book was BLAND. The hero is your typical caricature of a Victorian policeman, and a bit of a boor to the heroine besides. Also-why does every low brow historical police officer have to be named Mick? The only saving grace was that he wasn't portrayed as Irish as well!The heroine is a Spinster psychic (another popular Victorian Romance cliche)-what I couldn't understand is why she was written as strong enough to go to the police after having a vision of a murder, but quickly loses all reason and becomes dreary and ditzy-taking abuse from everyone, family included.The final small, but odd straw is the cover-why is a Victorian street policeman wearing a velvet cape like some Elizabethan popinjay?This book was not my cup of tea but others have given it positive reviews so you may want to try it for yourself.2 stars."
2,Tepid Romance,"My thoughts on this novel, it is a mild and very gentle romance. It had the potential to be a lot more but in some ways fell rather flat for me.Sophie Haversham could at times ""see"" into the future, she could foretell certain events, in this case the would be murder of Detective Mick Dunbar a Scotland Yard Detective.The main components of this book, the romance and mystery were bland, tepid. For me the romance didn't sizzle, there wasn't a lot of chemistry between Sophie and Mick. The mystery component was a fizzer, and I really didn't care when the culprit was ""unmasked."" I have read a few books by the author over the years and knew to expect a gentle romance. I just found this romance to be ""gentler"" than the authors usual stories. It was a bit of a disappointment for me."
4,Great Book,"This book was entertaining. The heroine is psychic, the hero is a Scotland Yard inspector. The characters have chemistry, the story is not slow moving or boring. Not the best I've read but not bad either."
2,Really glad I didn't pay hardback price for this,"I usually enjoy L. Guhrke's books. However this one was no not even close to being up to par with her others. Sadly enough, this is the book she chose to go hardback with. I guess the female character having a ""special ability"" could have been interesting, but it wasn't. I will continue to read this author's books unless she doesn't improve with the next few books."
5,"Progressive, other-worldly masterpiece","After buying this album based on the merit of the three players in the band, I was not at all shocked at what I heard-heavy, progressive fusion unlike anything ever made. It did not take long before I realized this was and will be the future of rock music. Technically there is nothing to be desired. These guys have the chops and are not afraid to exploit them. But what sets this album apart from most other ""prog"" albums is the atmosphere created within. At times it is seething and relentless, other times melodic and introspective but always other-worldly in its overall sound and vibe. I could go on and on about the three players in the band but I'm sure if you're reading this you already know of them. This type of music will always have a place in my c.d. player and as long as these guys keep making music I will never be bored. Look out for their next album!"
2,A paint-by-numbers shred disc,"I bought both 'Universe' and Sherinian's 'Planet X' CD and of the two, preferred the latter (being more of a progger than a fusioner). Universe is more of a 'shred' disc and the tunes are pretty lame, bluesy/fusion numbers that you've heard everywhere else. First rate playing but sleep inducing. Get the first disc instead."
2,think twice...its alright,Take my advice...if you want keys opt for Rudess or Wakeman or Emerson...if you want technical opt for Spiral Architect or Cynic. This stuff is a complete waste of good cd space. I only gave it two stars cause I really think they TRIED to put out a good product...they just failed.
4,New slant on fusion,"A good album by Sherinian, MacAlpine and Donati. It is guitar, drum and keyboard fusion, but it has a much harder edge than anything I've heard. It sounds somewhat like Dream Theater and Liquid Tension Experiment. Lots of solos and high energy music. I only wish there was a little bit more contrast. Although not as good as the Liquid Tension Experiment albums, it is a very good album for anyone who wants to hear a diffrent slant on fusion."
4,4 star review,I think the book was good because it had well written instructions and helpfull pictures.
5,Inspiring,"This is a highly inspiring work. In a time when frontiers are more philosophical than physical, it is hard to imagine borders Hubert Wilkins crossed.For those who traverse paths others avoid, this story will provide ceaseless inspiration. Bon voyage."
4,the last explorer,Good book about a great man. Sometimes to many details but interesting. Amazing how much one person can accomplish in a life time.
3,Interesting,Interesting story but it dragged on with too much detail. Well researched but lacked a flow of words that held my attention.
5,A gripping tale !,I liked this book. It was very factual without smothering you with boring details. I highly recommend. The Last Explorer will make you think about the heroic actions of the men from the golden age of exploration.
3,Excellent book about a currently unheralded polymath,"Fascinating explorer, adventurer, soldier, and inventor. I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you buy it and like history, and adventure, I think you will too"
1,Couldn't read past the first two chapters,"What a disappointment! I had hoped for something at least along the lines of ""River of Doubt"" by Candice Millard which is about Teddy Roosevelt's trip through the Amazon taken after his Presidential years. This was totally boring. Perhaps it would have been better later in the book but I couldn't make myself spend the time reading it to find out. Too many other books I want to read.I really enjoyed reading ""The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition by Caroline Alexander (Nov 3, 1998)"" and ""The Floor of Heaven"" by Howard Bloom. Maybe I was put off by starting with all the background information..??"
5,The Greatest Unknown,"The fact the Sir George Hubert Wilkins is a virtual unknown against the supposed greatness of his contemporaries, Hurley and Mawson, is due mainly to his ""aggressive modesty"".Now Australians are rediscovering this truly remarkable man's life and Simon Nasht does him an immensely great service.Simply a 'must-read'!"
1,No romance!,"No offense to y'all, but I'm 57 pages into this book, and ther's no romance! No romance at all. I'm sorry, but I live for summer romance. I read ""Summer Boys"",which was awesome, but the bookstore didn't have the sequel. This was the closest thing to romance I could find in the young adult. So far, he's decided he needs to be less goody goody, and met Razzle, who he doesn't think of as girlfriend material. At the moment, they're just starting to become friends. And, I hate to say this, but I don't think there's any romance coming up. So please, don't waste your money on this! Instead, read ""Summer Boys"" if you're looking for romance."
1,RIP OFF ! NOT WORTH 1/5 the sellers price!,these games can be bought at most stores new or used for $15 to $20 a piece. It has NEVER sold for $100 a piece! NEVER!! DONT BE RIPPED OFF!!!
4,jesi's thoughts,"I absolutely fell in love with this books plot because of the different places events Madison gets to interact with. Of course, predictable Madison Finn has one of those `story-book' obvious clauses when she GETS to share a bunk with Fiona Aimee, Lindsey, and a new girl Stacey, but yet she HAS to share it with Poison Ivy, Phony Joanie, and Rose Throne. What is Madison going to do? Especially when a jealous Fiona is out to get her, never mind a scary ghost in the middle of the night, and a haunting tower looming in the distance!"
4,Another awesome book by Laura Dower,"This book is about when Madison goes on a camping trip to Jasper Woods. Madison, Aimee, and Fiona expect to have a good time. Madison has so much on her mind!! Whether its climbing the tower, Ivy Daly, or her crush Hart Jones, she has so much on her mind!! When she goes back to Far Hills she will be so ready for lights out!"
2,Misinformation,"This is the same ""documentary"" book Medvedev publushed in Russian in 1989. Quite entertaining, but also quite confusing and often misinforming where it touches on the causes of the disaster. It follows the official line of putting all the blame on the station personnel (""thankfully"", most of the shift personnel died soon after the catastrophe from radiation sickness). It almost completely sidetracks the real cause: the faulty reactor design which made it uncontrollable under the circumstances.If you feel confused when reading about ""operational reactivity reserve"" -- don't be. The author is either confused himself, or is trying (not very successfully) to cover the inadequacies of the official analysis. Too bad the Anatoly Dyatlov's book (the deputy chief engineer, one of the few first-hand participants who lived long enough to write about the disaster) wasn't ever translated from Russian."
2,Not what I expected,I thought this book would be great with my Evolve Grill I bought. There is no pictures of the food and the book ended up being boring and useless to me.
3,George Foreman Grill and Recipe book.,"I like using it, but the book I ordered says that there are different heat settings, which mine does not have for those recipes."
3,Good With A Few Exceptions...,The product is great but the reason why I am not rating it five stars is because it is a nuisance to clean because the plates are not removable. Also cooking thick meats is not recommended because it cooks a bit unevenly. I am however satisfied with the purchase otherwise.
1,Not worth the money,I recieved this with my new GF Grill. I love my grill but the recipes in this book are not family friendly especially for kids. Mabey if you have time to go to the store and hunt for the ingredients. I would not recomend this book.
3,"Good for people who know how to cook. My son, who never boiled water, needed more help from me to figure it out.","My son, who never boiled water, needed more help from me to figure it out. Mostly uncertain about cooking time. Good prior jusgement is required."
2,George Foreman's Indoor Grilling,"All I can say is it was very disappointing! There is MAYBE one recipe I would even think about preparing. There is no general basic ideas for preparing everyday meals. If I hadn't bought it online, I could have looked thru it and I would have never purchased it!"
2,"A few more basics, please!","The general layout of the book is good, and I have tried some recipes. However, I had hoped for some good basic information about grilling steaks, with some theory regarding thickness of cut and fat content. There are bits of theory scattered here and there but a chapter about general grilling tips would have been quite helpful, since the manual that was included with the grill had very little information."
2,Kid's Book,"The book is not worth the money. The few recipes are what the Foremans like to eat at home, and they are not that healthy of meals. The grill, however, is a good appliance."
2,Great Fun Recipes...But Not Really Healthy,"The recepes are really nice and creative, but if you're trying to eat healthier--this is a book to skip. Just because a recipe is full of grilled veggies, the ""health"" benefits lessen when you dump enough olive oil, cheeses, etc on them to increase the fat content to a whopping 25-35 grams per serving--of which a lion's share of these recepes sport.The rubs and marinades section in the back is good, but if you're watching your weight, and don't like to constantly modify your cooking--grill or otherwise--to keep the fat at bay, this is not the book you want."
4,GFGR,"This really didn't have as easy recipes I was hoping. They took a lot of ingredents that I don't have but I still got some good ideas.If you are a more advanced cook, this would be a great book."
1,not too much,"Yeah, not too much in the way of helpful recipes. Also arranged kind of strange with the index. More recipes for ways to cook hamburgers, sausage and things that really are not the most healthy way to eat. Not sure where the title came from.If you can pick up a used copy, maybe give it a try but his original cookbook was awesome while this one is just barely a one-star.Get a copy of Lean Mean Fat reducing grilling machine cookbook and you'll get your money's worth and then some."
1,a gift,This was a wedding gift.....BUT when I leafed through it I was unimpressed with the recipes! OR lack of!!!
4,golf bag,"I like it. It's nice and light for carrying which is why I purchased it. I like the pockets, but my husband borrowed my bag and did not like the lower storrage pocket. But I do!"
2,very little information for the high price,"These two books are very slender and too pricey. There are better review books out there, such as the FNP Certification Review by Kidd, Robinson, and Kish."
2,Not for doors,"What I should say is: It is not for a door expert. The planer is great but the bevel guide adjusts in the opposite direction from most ""door"" planers. This is a problem because if you have the door on a saw horse, you will have to flip the door over to get the bevel going the correct way. Also then your marks would be on the opposite side if you mark on the high side. Otherwise is very nicely made."
3,nice but..,"Nice tool, I have always been pleased with Bosch tools, but where it is reconditioned, it came with no blades in the tool or the package. Had to go buy blades before I could use it."
3,Live document of latter-day edition of the band,"Given how many live albums the seminal line-up of the Airmen recorded, this 1982 recording of a depleted latter-day line-up is fairly superfluous.Who's on it? Hard to say, since the liner notes don't include a personnel listing. Commander Cody and guitarist Bill Kirchen seem to be the only original members. The replacements are all competent enough, but the stoney wonder of the original line-up was either gone, or just didn't make it to disc.It's a reasonably fun set, but more for the completist than for someone trying to get their first taste of the Airmen's live show. Try ""Live From Deep in the Heart of Texas"" or ""We've Got a Live One Here"" first."
3,"Basic intro, but some problems","I first must say that this is most certainly not Ms. Davidson' best work. Several of her other books are quite a bit better.The book looks at Northern European beliefs, myths, and archaeology and seeks to build a general picture of pagan religions among Celtic and Germanic peoples. The book provides a cursory look at archaeology of sacred spaces, some linguistic issues and some basic reviews of myths and legends. On the positive side, the book's scope is pretty good.On the negative side, I found Davidson's analysis to be overly short and her methodology to be fuzzy.I would recommend skipping this book and focusing on her other books instead (many of which are excellent)."
3,less communications with audiences,Due to the special audiences B. B. does not talk and sing. One important part of live performance is missing. Yet his guitar play is as great as in Cock County Jail. I recommend Regal and Cock County Jail more than this CD.
3,Book excellent example of what JKD isnt,"For those new to JKD, this book is an excellent example by Jerry Beasley of what JKD is not. Beasley, a student of Joe Lewis (Lee student but never certified by Lee), shows step by step how to perform an art which is the antithesis to JKD. Great book exemplifying what's not JKD."
1,OK effort but misses the mark,"In reading this I got the notion that not much effort was put into research, only money for seminars. The opinions are narrow and the author rarely has a discovery we haven't already heard. I do give him credit on making people aware of ""concepts"".Many times the chapters contain the same information presented earlier.Very outdated and will not be regarded as a ""timeless classic""."
4,A well crafted spy thriller,"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Spy (also published under the title Catch a Falling Spy) is a well crafted spy thriller that incorporates elements of dark comedy with gritty action, suspense, and a noir atmosphere. The characters lack the depth of Bernard Sampson, the star of many of Deighton's later novels, but they are nonetheless intriguing. British agent Harry Palmer teams with CIA agent Mickey Mann to help Bekuv, a Russian scientist, defect. Bekuv refuses to cooperate unless his beautiful young wife, Katerina, joins him. Added to the mix are a U.S. senator and his aide, and a failed CIA operative, Harry Dean, who may or may not be a traitor--but the loyalty of nearly every principle character is in doubt through much of the novel. Deighton takes the reader on a wild ride, mixing credible action scenes with atmospheric intrigue. Fans of spy fiction shouldn't miss this one."
3,VAMP vs. FRANK,This flick was in good shape deleivered. This flick was very different than most? With women in the lead rolls!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,More damn cg blood.,"This will be short and to my point. From the title and pictures you know what your in for. I am so damn tired of the cg blood. It is so obvious when it shows up because it's not the same color as the rest of the blood and it's shiny. The cg kills are a joke. Watch the Midnight Meat Train and you'll see what I mean. The only way this works for me is if the movie is 3D because you want the blood to jump out so it doesn't have to look realistic. In Saw 4 or 5 not sure, they have a dude getting crushed by 2 moving walls. As soon as he gets it cg blood squirts al over. In the making of they said they built a prostetic arm and crushed. Then why use cg. It doesn't enhance it. Just built fake body parts and use buckets of blood not from a computer. Anything that this movie did have going for it was ruined because it had english voice overs. Americans (I am one) can't do the japanese anime type of voice acting. I wouldn't rent it if I were you."
4,Totally Worth It!,"If you're a fan of japanese gore flicks then Vampire Girl v. Frankenstein Girl is totally worth it. Hilarious, silly plot, over the top gore and cheesy make up and effects. Pretty much everythng you would expect from the genre"
5,Vampire Girl vs. Frankenstein Girl is Amazing!,"This is one of the weirdest movies ever. After the first 5 minutes, I knew that it was going to be one of the best movies that I have ever seen. It is very funny and very bloody. A must for fans of campy horror comedy gore films!"
2,"Fast, Cheap Not The Problem","Tasteless attempts at humor sink this one. The ""black"" humor may try to poke fun at those Yeti/Yamamba girls in Japan (with the orange tan), but it's beyond unfunny - these directors claim to want an international audience, so it's time for some sensitivity training. The cutting gags are just not funny. Also, there is little substance to offset the silliness. The three primary female leads are very pretty, and the photography is bright and sharp, but that's about all the good points. There's a difference between good low-brow (Rabelais) and this stuff."
1,Just horrible....,"This movie has no redeeming qualities, whatsoever. It's just silly and bloody for no reason. I am all for campiness when it makes sense (for example, Army of Darkness will always be one of my favorite movies), but this is just plain bad. Please save your money and your time."
1,Just god awful,"the people didnt seem to even know how to act the story line was horrible and the entire thing was so unbelievably stupid and at most times just random that it makes me sick to think I spent money to buy this piece of junk, save your money and dont buy this crap"
1,This movie Is Racist To African American,"I have seen alot of things an heard alot things, whether to believe that most Hollywood movie is racist. If you go see a movie you see that the black guy is the first to die protecting the blond girl or he protect her at the end than the he dies at the end of the movie.On this one movie I can't think of the name where this blond girl, asian girl, and black hair white girl go to a camp, where a friend took the guy who broke his leg by climbing a mountain with his bare hand.So now he's and a wheelchair, time to fastforward a bigfoot attack the black hair girl first in the bathroom then attack the asian girl but she survive, then attacked the blond,but she survive only because the bigfoot went back to killed the asian girl. You see racist,why do the blond girl or black hair white guy always got to survived in movies.So the Vampire Girl vs. Frankenstein Girl deals with being extremely racist to us African Americans."
3,"Renamed, repackaged 'The Mirror'","This cd is actually the 'The Mirror', with a new title and cover art. Musically, this is actually a pretty strong work, even without original vocalist Mike Harrison. The late Mike Patto was front man on this lp, and had a similar, ""rusty drainpipe"" voice as Harrison. Gary Wright, the main songwriter with the band, contributes some strong tunes (Hell or High Water, Fantasy Satisfier, The Mirror). Certainly not up 'Spooky Two'(a truly great album), nor with 'You Broke My Heart..."" or 'Witness', but for Spooky Tooth fans, a necessary addition."
3,"Only A Remake, Shucks!","I was a little disappointed to find this was a not new Spooky Tooth music. I love this album anyway, Gary was just getting into special effects which is seen (or heard) at the end of ""Higher Circles"""
5,Awesome,"This video is one of the best video's that has been performed. The more video's Bill Gaither puts out, the better they get. I can't get enough of the songs ""My Name is Lazarus"" by Greater Vision and ""A House of Gold"" by Mark Lowry, Guy Penrod, David Phelps and Michael English. I enjoy the harmony in these upbeat songs and in the other songs on the video. They put a joy in my heart and a dance in my feet. After watching the video, you will feel good all over. Well done Bill Gaither and the Homecoming Friends."
3,"Groundbreaking idea, burdensome requirements","I played with Motion at an Apple store and was so impresssed, I immediately/spontaneously bought it. I'm running it on a first generation 2 Ghz dual processor G5 with 2 gigs of RAM and a Radeon 9600 graphic card and it is slow and sometimes doesn't render ""on the fly"" at all. So now I have to get a faster ($600) ""recommended"" video card and all will be nice according to Apple. I've purchased the highest end Apple products since the Apple II and now I am annoyed. Hey Apple, if you write software that runs slowly on your fastest professional machine - DON'T RELEASE IT!!! I must have spent $10,000 in the last year and a half on Apple products and NOW I'm burnt out. I'll stick to After Effects (which can't do what Motion does without hours of keyframing) and eliminate my ""on the fly"" expectations."
2,You may hate it instead of loving it.,"If you are used to Adobe After Effects, then be prepared for a rude surprise. The interface for Motion is nothing like that of AE. If you are used to Discreet products such as *flame, *flint, *effect or *edit, then it will make more sense. I am running it on a dual 2ghz G5 w/3GB of RAM and it is still not ""real time"" enough for my liking. Take it for a test drive before purchasing if you can.Be warned!"
5,Love it!,"I love this cd, just got it today! Works perfectly! Just my only thing is that I plugged it into iTunes and my computer made a noise and then imported the songs to the libaray. So when I went to listen the two songs skip in the middle of the song for a couple of seconds. The rest are ok tho. But in the CD player they work perfectly fine."
4,Please Be Mine It's About Time,The CD arrived in perfect condition at my house. Just a miserable little scratch. But it dosen't matter. Buy it! worth it!
3,JO BRO fan,"The Jonas Brothers got thier feet wet with this album. I am way over 13, but my niece and her friends loved them since 2005. I must admit the album is pretty good for 3 brothers from New Jeresy. We have all of their albums. I will probably have to stand in line for as long as they are a hit. I am also a fan of the Jonas Brothers."
2,rips off of many bands,"The CD isn't bad...I'll give them that much. But the Jonas Brothers are nothing new. The most obvious similarity is to the Hanson Brothers. Hanson vs. Jonas, Hanson wins >10 years ago. ""What I Go to School For"" & ""Year 3000"" are covers of songs by Busted, an immensely popular boy/pop-punk band in the UK before they broke up. Busted vs. Jonas, Busted wins for their #1s. Finally, ""6 Minutes"" is a rip from LFO, another boy band from way back when. LFO vs. Jonas, LFO because Rich Cronin can school these kids with his raps and his looks. The CD's a nice try, but these kids should wait until they grow up and actually have a say on what they record."
5,This was a real cool CD,"I got this planely for Year 3000 but I ended liking the entire CD! Its really cool how these guys sing, although im glad the little one matured now and doesnt sound like a little girl anymore."
2,Talented brothers put out so so album,"I know these three brothers are very talented. They play a number of instruments, sing, and write, which is very cool for teenagers. They've all sung on Broadway and acted in TV commercials too. And this is a fun enough album. But this album doesn't really showcase the Jonas Brother's real talent like it should have. Record executives are manipulating the Jonas Brothers like a kid molds clay. They decide what the Jonas Brothers will do, will write, will play, and play up the cuteness factor with antics and funny faces. Johnny Wright did it before and it works, but for only so long.I really wish this album could have been done entirely by the boys themselves, writing, playing guitars, all that serious stuff, and done their way. They can do that, especially the youngest one. He's a freaking musical prodigy! But it didn't happen. They are Disney Radio darlings for now."
3,dry,I was really excited to learn more about such an important figure in baseball history. This in an unexciting story about a man of fire. It is sad that there is not more energy from this book.
4,Great Reading for Students of Baseball History,"If you are, like me, a serious student of baseball history who never tires of reading about the ""old days"", you will enjoy this book. If you are a casual baseball fan looking for light baseball reading, this is probably not the book for you.I think most of the other reviews posted here are on the mark: a lot of factual and interesting research into the life and times of the great John McGraw. People like me love this kind of stuff. But at times it can be bland, uninspired writing that would likely bore the casual baseball fan."
2,Look for an auto leveling laser level.,"I received this for free when I purchased a GMC miter saw. It can take a lot of time adjusting it for level and you don't want to push to hard on it after you have leveled it or it could get slightly out of level again. My tripod has a wide base on it therefore it comes into contact with one of the rubber feet on the bottom of this level which makes it very hard to tighten this level down onto my tripod. It has different speeds for the 360 degree line so can make out the line in brighter conditions. It can also do something like a 30, 45, and 60 degree line on the wall by moving the laser head back and forth. This makes for an even brighter line. I suppose if I moved the rubber foot and filed down the raised plastic next to it, I could give this level a three star rating."
2,Could be better,"This thing would jam on itself when adjusting the thumbwheels. It would stop spinning in most positions, which makes the adjustments worthless. I ended up removing the adjustable part, which lets the laser spin properly, but then you need a perfectly flat surface to put it on. It was cheap so i didn't expect too much from it, and I've been able to make it work by propping it up when i need to use it. Maybe I just got a bad one, but I would recommend investing more in a quality laser if you need to get heavy use of of it. I do like how it has a second beam out the top that gives you a perfect right angle. Also the beam length adjustment is a nice feature."
1,Ice cream scoop,"Don't believe it, it isn't any better than a regular stainless steel spoon. No miracles here, waste of money. Buy something else, you won't be satisfied with this, I most certainly am not."
4,Most Wonderful Ice Cream Scoop I've Ever Had!,"I was really tired of the 'regular' ice cream scoops. The ice cream constantly got lodged in the scoop and sometimes even 'watering' it first didn't help! Plus, my arthritis made that whole process more difficult. I tried different scoop sizes and bought 3 different ones, including one that was all plastic, but not one of them worked very well and hurt my hands to use them. I finally found this spade and it has made ALL the difference! It EASILY gets even the hardest frozen ice cream out of the tub, and doesn't hurt my hands like the others So what if you can't get little, neat scoops with it? It WORKS when none of the others would. My only complaint is that it's not dishwasher safe and I have to wash it by hand. So I took off one star for washing by hand but otherwise, I highly recommend this one!"
1,Disappointed,I bought this item hoping it would be as great as the pampered chef scoop that I lost when I moved but needless to say I should have just bought another pampered chef one. This item doesn't cut through ice cream as easily as advertised. It was a disappointment.
