2,"Tisk, tisk, tisk","Mr. Vaccaro, please. I appreciate the history lesson, but quite frankly, not all wrestling fans live in the basement of their Mother's house and catalogue PPV results. The vast majority of wrestling fans live in the present; hence why the WWE product has become ""faddy"" as of late. It's trying to turn a profit on the disgusting practices of modern society. John Cena's character is the prime example. White America is now speaking ebonics, and wearing the garb of an inner city gang member. It's now chic to be a rapper. John Cena appeals to that audience. Now, if Vince McMahon didn't seek out the help of the new Hollywood writers, we would never have this problem.In this sense, the WWE product is predictable and its not worth watching anymore. Maybe if the WWE product appealed to their rooted audience through nostalgic angles and storylines, they'd be in a better position."
5,wtf,"Why the hell Vince McManhon can't just let Kurt Angle be the champ once more cuz im pretty sure that everybody is f*cking sick and tired of cena being the champ, John Cena Sucks, you hear me, he freakin sucksI dont know if theres any body who can beat Kurt, the feud between cena and angle should be over, kurt should be the champ,today is November 24, survivor series is on Nov, 27, if Kurt doesnt win this time, F*CK YOU Vince, kiss my @$$"
1,WAR,"I think that there will be a Survivor Series Elimination Match between 4-5 of RAW's best superstars vs. 4-5 Smackdown's best superstars after what happened on WWE RAW Homecoming. I want this Survivor Series Elimination Match to be a ""WARGAMES MATCH!!!"""
5,Excellent for standard price,"This unit was purchased to replace the orginal stereo in my boat. Not only did it sound great, but it blows away my original unit."
1,Undecided,"The unit was relatively easy to install, although instructions were minimal. The radio works well, but AM stations are difficult to receive, even with an optional antenna. Just after installation, the CD quit working and would not eject the CD. Afer discussion with technical service, and trying suggested remidies, I shipped the unit to St. Louis for replacement. I am awaiting the new unit. If it works properly, I will increase its rating.A new unit was returned to me about two weeks after shipping the defective unit back. The new unit seems to function properly and I am therefore giving it a higher rating of four stars."
5,Great Breakout Performance,"This CD is fantastic. If you're in for that chill experience where you can just sit back and kick it, this is the CD for you. Not only that, but the vocals rock and the band can spice it up when you least expect it. Definitely worth the fifteen bucks. Enjoy!"
5,A Series Your Child will Enjoy Reading,"The Magic Tree House series got my third Grader son reading. My son couldn't wait to read this one and enjoyed it as much as the others! Number 22 in the series, this installment is true to Jack and Annie's adventures. The book is 2nd in their quest to Save Camelot. Jack and Annie go back to the Revolutionary War period. They learn about America's fight for independence and a lesson about perseverance. I like the way it presents factual events and history to the young reader. The book also gives facts about the Revolutionary War that teachers and parents can build on. Mary Pope Osborne does a wonderful job in writing a series that children anxiously await the next installment!"
5,Great book!,How would you feel if you were in a war? Find out by Reading Revolutionary War on Wednesday by Mary Pope Osborne. Jack and Annie were in a war to get a stone forGeorge Washington. I really liked this book because it was funny. Will Jack and Annie get the stone in time? Find out by reading this book!
3,The Revolution,"If you're big on time travel, this is the book for you. At frog Creek, Pennsylvania 2000, on Wednesday, in the tree house, a book appears. They just pointed to the place that they wanted to go and said ""I wish we could go there."" Before they new it, they were standing in the snow of the Revolutionary War on Wednesday, December 25, 1776. Uh oh, British or Patriots? Find out in this exciting read, Revolutionary War On Wednesday."
3,revolutionary war on wednesday,"one summer day in Frog Creek, Pensylvania, a Mysterious tree house oppeared in the woods. eight year old Jack and his seven year old sister; annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books. Jack and annie soon discovered that the tree house was majic. It could take to the places in the books, all they had to do was point a picture and wish to go there. Along the way, Jack and annie discovered that the tree belong to Morgan Le fay.morgan is a magical library from camelot,long ago of king auther.She travles through the time and space gathering books.

2,used books...yuck,"I have purchased the 1 cent books often, without trouble - granted they are only a penny. But when I received a set of books from this seller they stunk of gasoline. I had to throw away one of the books. I sent a note via the Amazon link with no response."
1,Revolutionary War on Wednsday,"This unbelievably immature book carries you on the extremely overrated adventures of Jack and Annie. As they go back in time, Jack and annie meet Gerge Washington, and give him advice. I'm not trying to be unpatriotic, but, this book our founder look like a weak reason to be proud of our country. I dont reccomend this book, unless you spend your time reading second grade textbooks. For pleasure."
2,Nothing Special,"I purchased the Technics based on the good words of Consumer Reports. If I had no stereo equipment, I might consider it a good deal at a good price. Unfortunately, my $... Teac AV receiver from Costco seems to be the equal of the Technics. My 11 year old Yamaha integrated Dolby surround sound amp is certainly it's superior.The back panel is well laid out, with a good number of connections. However, setup is not as easy or intuitive as one would hope for.If budget is a concern, with the $... rebate, this is probably a decent buy. However, I think there are other alternatives that might be considered as better choices."
1,Liked it at first,"I got one just like this at Conn's but it was the 52"" model. I was really impressed when I got it home. The HD through the component input is beutiful. But here is what you need to watch out for BURN IN in on the side bars if you watch it in 4:3 mode and I am talking less then 3 months with only occasionally watching it with black bars on the side. Akai put in small print on the front page of their manual that they will not warrent any type of burn in. I did call them anyway and they won't do a thing. If you do buy this TV make sure you always watch in 16:9 mode or you too will get side bar burn in."
5,Works good,"After breaking on of the whips while mixing a heavy dough, we decided we needed a replacement. It is an exact fit to the original and snapped right into the driver. Lesson learned, don't mix heavy cookie dough with the wire whips... that's what the cookie dough paddles are for."
4,Customer Service Tried Hard,"Initially the company sent two Bosch Mixer whips, but they sent them in a thin, regular paper envelope, so during shipping the envelope tore open and one whip fell out. So I called the company and they apologized and said they would send another right out, which they did, but it was the wrong whip and doesn't fit. I only really needed one and wanted one as backup, so oh well. Not worth the trouble or money to send it back and get the right one, but they really did try. Would be smarter to send it in better packaging!"
5,"Fun to read, fun to look at","I bought this book after seeing it in the ""Oppenheim Toy Portfolio"" guide. My 21 month-old daughter and I instantly fell in love with it after reading only the first few pages. The rhyme is fun and the illustrations are lovely and colorful. *Great* read-aloud book - highly recommended!"
3,okay,"good as ordered, however a spring to operate a flap on bottom was broken but it doesn't seem to affect operation"
4,Great Collection!,"Although I like this collection, I feel that this is NOT for the casual fan since they may not recognize most of the songs. I'm glad the ""If Not For You"" is included. I recommend ""Magic: The Best Of..."" to the casual fan."
1,Seen it before,"Yes, this game is a basic knock off of Bust-A-Move (also now available on DS). This game brings a couple new features to the table though:A touch screen that you will NOT use in gameplayBlocks that make stupid faces at you the entire timeAnd most importantly, This game will also give you the ability to wonder if the Gameboy Advanced version of the exact same game is any different than this game.While it is better than your average bargain bin titles, this game still lacks where it counts"
4,He is so strong that he always breaks things.,"This is the story of Mr. Strong.Mr. Strong is the strongestperson in the whole wide world. Mr. Strong gets his power from eating eggs and more eggs.This is part of the Mr. Men series. There are many other Mr. Men books available. These are great books for kids. The Mr. books are just the right length to read two of them to kids at bedtime, and they all teach some important lesson.Most of the Mr. Men books have other Mr. Men in them, but this book only has Mr. Strong, a farmer, and a couple people that he meets in the town.Of the Mr. Men books that I have read, I would not recommend this one, it it not the best work by Roger Hargreaves. I would recommend Mr. Tall before buying this one. If you do buy a Mr. Men book, then you should get a couple because they are very small."
4,alien tribal landscapes,"This wont be for everyone, but if you already appreciate Evan Parker's alien approach to his music then most likely you'll dig this album.Evan and Richard Nunns create a tribal atmosphere combining Evan's horn with a variety of traditional Maori instruments...flutes, percussion, various wind implements. Sometimes it feels like your in a rainforest at night, or in the desert on a vision quest. This album gets better with each listen. Recommended for the adventurous."
1,It's Elementary,I was looking for an equivalent to Math on Call by Great Source that is perfect for middle school students. English on call level one is for elementary students. It also it more of a teaching tool instead of a book to help explain the basic english rules and how we use them and examples. I am still looking for a good english handbook if anyone has suggestions.
2,You get what you pay for,"This cutter is cheap to purchase and its build quality reflects exactly that. The sample I received included blades that were not particularly sharp, and had so much play that the blades tended to 'nick' each other when the cutter was opened and closed. Since the blades were not particuilarly sharp, they tended to unnecessarily 'mash' the cigar before they began to cut, and the cut itself was relatively rough. At this item's price you can't complain too much, but just be aware that you may not get a cutter with which you will be happy."
1,Another piece of garbage made in China!!!!,"Don't waste your time or money. This product is a piece of garbage. For the same price buy the ""Cuban Crafters Revolucion Cigar Scissors""."
3,Would be 5 stars after a proofreader checks it over.,"This has the potential for 5 stars, but the clerical errors throughout will become distracting to the reader who pays attention to detail. The prose is riveting from beginning to end. The slice-of-life activities of Bable and his buddies keeps you turning the pages to see what will befall them next. The sketches and vivid descriptions with remembered dialogue all help to make you feel their pain and frustration right along with them. It was a revelation, too, that the rumors were actually true what I'd heard about General MacArthur's reprehensible role during that time. After reading this book, I can believe it all.SSGT Bable grabs you right off with humor in the first pages, and then he's able to keep you entertained while recalling some of his lowest and discouraging days in some pretty scary places. I'm just glad he made it home and filled in a journal to make this book. It's a slice of history we shouldn't forget."
2,"Acting on reality tv, sad story","So this show sets itself up to compete with deadliest catch, it fell extremely short! Several times within the first three episodes you can clearly tell they are acting or being told to act out certain situations a certain way. I drew the line when they edited in a fake shark and copious amounts of blood to a scene to add shock value. All the fights and arguments seem scripted. Had a lot of potential but sorry SPIKE Tv you just arent ever gonna be deadliest catch! Save your money and watch deadliest catch"
5,Fighting Powerline Noise,One of the few books about fighting power line problems. Oriented to the ham or short wave listener. Easy to read.
4,Noblesse oblige,"Is good, because the words have the true meangfull, i like it.i write this telling my friend's that nothing better you will ever listen too, that is better than this."
1,smell horrible,If you like an overpowering chemical eucalyptus stink then this is for you.I had to throw away due to the odor. Would have returned but dog found one in the garage and buried itEven the dog knew it smelled like SH&&&*T.
5,Bed buddy mittens,"When I come in from snow blowing (for the billionth time this year)my hands just ache from the cold. I throw my heatable mittens in the microwave for 1 1/2 minutes and they really warm up my hands! I got a pair for my daughter who lives in the dorms and always has cold hands. I hope she enjoys them, too."
5,Very Helpful!,"My mom whom is suffering from the side effects of radiation and chemo plus a major surgery - is always cold. I can keep her body warm with blankets, etc, but her feet and hands are always freezing. This item has helped her out quite a bit. Thanks for helping my mom."
4,Works well for my RA,These mitts work well when I'm having a flare of my Rheumatoid Arthritis. Wish they had pads on the inside as well as the outside of the mitts.
1,"wrong size, too small to fit on my hand","Gloves too small for my hands, so now just sitting in closet because the cost of returning them exceeds cost of product. They should specify the size so that buyer can know if they will fit"
5,Bed Buddy Warming Mittens,"I use thse mittens everyday, since I have a problem with cold hands due to Spinal Stenosis. They heat up easily in the mocrowave & stay hot/warm for quite awhile. they get me through the days & nights, especially in the winter. Love them.Russ"
3,Too bulky.,"The hand warmers are okay, but the design is poor. Too bulky. Feels like boxing gloves. Could be much better."
4,Great idea,"We love this idea for our daughter with special needs, but the inserts are too heavy for her to manage. So my husband plans to use these mittens and is looking forward to it."
2,"Really, really terrible","I love old-school kung-fu.For reference, I would say that my two favorites are: ""Master of the Flying Guillotine,"" and ""5 Elemental Ninja.""Dirty Ho is AWFUL! Granted the only reason I bought it was because I delight in seeing people read the title and squirm thinking it must be an ""adult"" title... but it is really bad.Every character looks exactly the same except for Ho, who is easily distinguished by a small bandage on his head. Apparently the fact that he has a band-aid on his head makes him ""dirty?"" Shouldn't his name be ""Injured Ho?"" or ""Wounded Ho?"" I dunno.The fighting is pretty mediocre especially considering you can't tell who is who (except for Ho). If there is a plot I couldn't figure it out...Stay away."
2,"A classic, but....","This movie is a classic old-school kung-fu movie. Gordon Liu always entertains and choreography is top notch for its time. However, the release from Red Sun entertainment is a disappointment. On the DVD cover it states that it is remastered, I highly doubt that. The picture looks grainy and you can see the tracking adjustments on a few scenes that usually happens on VHS tapes. I was hoping that celestial pictures would remaster this picture like other Shaw Bros. films."
4,Wonderful nostalgia,"At age 6, I grabbed the Lee car with my older brother to visit Central library, downtown. I rode the sandbox next to my motorman father on the rock 'n' roll Creve Couer line. I knew the inside of the car barn at Delmar and DeBaliviere, the coffee shop across the street where Dad and other Public Service folks hung out,and the bustle of the Wellston loop. The book taught me things I didn't know, reminded me of things I'd forgotten, and showed me lots of pictures of the city and the cars I loved as a kid. The reproductions are very good; the captions as interesting as the text. I loved the map of the rail system in 1962. If only it had been circa 1940...."
5,Absolutely spectacular,"One of the best blues albums ever produced! This CD is the work of a true bluesman, with a lot of soul and emotion. It's hard to find another guitar player who shifted so radically his style as Richie did. In case you don't know, Richie was the 80's shredder prototype: hyper-speed-guitar-boring-licks, a lot of technique, but no feel whatsoever. The peak of his uncoolness was perhaps his work in the Poison, one of those cheesy hair bands from the 80's weird musical scene. This is definitely in Richie's past, and in this album he mingles great technique, true blues inspiration, and an awesome punchy guitar tone. His version of Tobbaco Road is just breathtaking. Guitar lovers around the world, this album is a must have. Yeah, the blues is allright!!"
5,Excellent Stereo,"All you need and expect out of a compact stereo system. Superior, sounds - crisp and clean. I had it in my living room until I purchased by surround sound stereo, and it easily filled up the room.Person below had some service issues - I have had the stereo for 9 months now and - knock on wood - haven't had an issue.The base is a little longer like he said - that could be an issue, but if you have the space it's well worth it.I would highly recommend this system to anyone. You won't be disappointed."
4,Nice earrings,"These are a nice black and are the smaller size. My only issue is the clasp (I guess you'd call it that) on the back. The edges were rough and irritated the back of my ear, so I replaced them with some spares I had. Otherwise, I really liked them."
1,Risky Gamble,"After waiting 8 days for this DVD player to arrive, I was extremely upset to find that it didn't work. After plugging it in and inserting a DVD, none of the buttons on the right side of the player responded (play, stop, eject, etc.). I had played this same DVD earlier at work so I knew it wasn't the disc. After messing around with it for an hour and half, I finally got the DVD out. I returned this one and bought an APEX that was the same price. It felt way more sturdy than the Daewoo and works like a champ. I think it's luck of the dice whether you get a working one or a lemon. I read the positive reviews some people wrote and decided to take the gamble. I wish I hadn't. It's going to take at least 2 weeks to get my account credited, not to mention the hassle of shipping it back. I wouldn't buy this one unless you're the kind of person who finds money on the street all the time."
1,A piece of junk not worth buying,I bought this dvd in the summer and It works okay But there are many flaws like the picture quality is not good and am using a s video the picture is blurry bleeding kind like the remote broke the same week I bought it and the remote does not power the dvd you have to get up to turn on or off what a disgrace of dvd
2,Fine for the first few hours,Everything checked out fine until a few hours had elapsed and the audio cds quit playing. DVDs still played fine. Waited for a couple hours to see if it would play the cds again but no such luck and returned it.
1,"Player Freezes, and Customer Service is terrible","This player was broken out of the box. It played fine for 20 minutes and then the picture froze. Turning it off and back on again did not revive it--only waiting an hour or so would it start to work again . . . for another 20 minutes.Though I called customer service two days after I bought it (which involved over an hour of wait time before an automated menu gave me the number of a local representative--and forget about online help--the site seems designed to keep you from contacting them) I was not offered an exchange, and all the work to replace the damaged product had to be made by me. I was asked to bring it to a ""repair place"" that was so far out of my way, getting there and back would cost more than the unit. Daewoo's philosphy is not, apparently, ""The customer is always right,"" but rather ""Buyer beware.""Do not buy this product, or--I would recommend--anything from Daewoo."
4,Overall good But few Snags,"Price is a bargain.Quality of picture: Very good and vibrant colors thru s-video, But more than usually compromised when connected thru regular video out. on a scle of 1-10, S- Video score 8.5, (Regular Video score 6)Audio: Very good on a scale of 1-10 its about 8.5MP3: Very Nice.Other features( you know what I mean): ExcellentOnly drawback No power on/off on remote control.Inside stuff- The drive is easily replacable if it should ever go bad.Overall: A very good player if played thru s-video. Will buy one more for my Sis for x'mas."
4,good DVD for the price,"We purchased this DVD player for my parents for Christmas. It was easy to setup and the quality of the video displayed is very good. The only complaint that we had was that the remote control does not have a power on/off button. Not sure how this got overlooked by the manufacturer - maybe people in Japan aren't as lazy as we Americans!! My parents are not ""technical"" people, but have not had any problems learning to use it. For the price we paid - it was a good value."
4,"Some inconsistent quality issues, but, overall a good player","When the first Daewoo DVD Player arrived, it did not play DVDs well. At intermittent times, the player would simply freeze. The only thing that would ""wake it back up"" was power cycling the DVD player. I notified amazon.com customer service and they were *GREAT*. They refunded my return shipping charges and rushed a new / replacement unit out. So far the new Daewoo DVD Player (same model) is working just fine.Overall, I recommend this model. It is full of features at a great price. There may be some quality issues (on some units). Chances are, you won't be affected by these quality issues."
1,Good basic player for about two weeks,"We thought this player was just great for about two weeks. Since then, it freezes about once every movie we play, and we cannot get it to work again except by shutting it off and on. Occasionally, even that has not worked, and it refuses to stop freezing. I was too lazy to do anything about it until now (almost 10 months later); I'll probably have to buy a new player because it just freezes too much now, and I don't think I'll be able to get the company to do anything."
1,We sent it back,"This DVD player has slightly worse picture quality than a cheap VCR. The picture was fuzzy and the color was off. There is no way to adjust the color and human faces had a greenish glow that isn't incredibly realistic. One of the DVDs that we tried skipped and stuck often. The sound quality, also, wasn't up to par. We tested it side by side with our other DVD player and there was no comparison to the life-like, skip-free Genica which is not an expensive player. We sent it back and are still waiting for a refund."
1,Skips and freezes constantly,I am embarrased to have given two of these for Christmas. I bought for one myself and if the ones I gave are as unreliable the recipients may never rent or buy another DVD...
1,Do not buy,Bought this for my mom as a Christmas present and it worked well for about 6 months- then it refused to read either DVDs or CDs. Still does not work and my mom had to buy a new one.
1,Daewoo Color unacceptable,"Just letting you all know that my unit was shipped defective. The color/contrast cycled from dim/no color to bright/overexposed color. thios happened every 10 seconds. I also had problems with the subtitles appearing everytime I used features that had nothing to do with subtitles. I had turned off the subtitles in the setup page, but they still appeared. Wierd.I can't recommend this product and have asked for a refund. I guess I'll go with Sony for a few bucks more."
3,Adequate,"Adequate DVD player for the price...One major omission, however is the lack of a remote on/off. You can do most basic functions with the remote except turn the unit on or off."
1,Garbage,"I am extremely dissapointed w/ the performance of this dvd player. I can't even begin to tell you how poor the image quality on this receiver really is. I have tried playing three different movies and none have played correctly. After every two or three seconds of play you will see either the screen flicker or small pauses in the video sequence. Oh yeah, one more thing. Even if you can put up w/ the flickering and the pauses in play, you cannot scroll through the different movie chapters too much without freezing the player.I am not exaggerating when I say that the image quality on my 70 dollar vcr far outperforms the video quality on this dvd player."
3,"GREAT price, OK player.","You can't beat the price on this player, but it's not the highest quality in the world. My other DVD player is a Sony that has always worked flawlessly. While the picture and sound on this Daewoo have been fine, it does have a few flaws. When I first start a disc playing, the subtitles are always on. There is no soft power off, the only way to turn off the player is to push the giant power button. The motor itself is very loud and continues to run after you've stopped the disc, which makes me uncomfortable NOT turning it off. And we've experienced periodic lockups where the picture just stops moving and the player won't respond to any buttons being pushed...we have to turn it off and back on to get it to recover. None of these are giant problems, though, and I think this player is a good choice if you're on a slim budget."
2,Buttons -ouch,"I found the buttons on the main console to be a bit chessy overall... One may expect the units panel can be damaged if not taken care of... and no R-G-B or HDTV interface *sigh*Overall there are nice features not meantioned such as the Karoke Feature on the Unit and that it can play ""-r"" type medias such as MP3's.Overall Happy., but not overly impressed."
4,Good and Bad Points,"Great, cheap DVD player, multiregion capability with the remote hack. Only problem is that if your not careful, it goes crazy, and scratches up the discs. Something to do with multiregion I think, because it only does it with my region 2 discs. So if you are thinking of using this multiregion, try somthing else. But if you are looking to play R1 DVD, VCD, SVCD, MP3, look no furthur, this is EXCELLENT!"
5,Great for video downloaders.,"I have heard nothing but good about this DVD player.It plays all standard DVD great.First it plays all 6 DVD regions even with RCE. It can be switched to play NTSC or Pal.It plays all video standards. VCD, XVCD, SVCD, XSVCD, MiniDVD, DVDc, DVD-R, DVD-RW, and DVD+RW. And don't forget Mp3s. (thx vcdhelp.com for that info)I have a collection of videos I have download of the net and can what to get this DVD player to watch them with. I have heard nothing but good about this player."
2,"Goes bad no matter what, so just don't buy it","I liked this player quite a bit except for the same flaws that the other reviewers have mentioned (no power button, subtitles always come on, loud motor,etc.), but now i've had it for about 2 years and it's definitely broke. Whenever I turn the power on, the display on my tv screen is all wavy and multicolored ...totally unviewable, and it has problems reading the disc. So, judging by the other reviews, 2 years is a pretty long time for this piece of crap to work, so I consider myself lucky. Don't make the same mistake we made and buy it because it seems to have alot of features for the cheap price. Buyer Beware!!"
5,excellent,"A great buy. Multi-voltage, works in the US and Europe, Multi-region, plays DVD's no matter where in the world you buy them."
3,Availability,"Umm...just ordered it. Haven't recieved it yet. Don't let the ""Availability: 2-3 days"" fool ya. It's actually 2-3 weeks."
4,not to shabby,"I've owned this dvd player for 2 months now and a few of the new disc have frozen on me. It's kinda ghetto! But it's also a ghetto price. don't get me wrong, I'm not a DVD player hater...It's just I expected a little more. But for the most part,all is well."
3,Good and cheap,"Nowdays it is outdated - even HD-DVD is dead now :) It cannot do upscaling, so not good for large TV sets."
4,Very good entry-level model,"The DVG-3000N is an excellent choice for beginers, screen is crystal clear as well as the sound (be it movie, cd or mp3), basic all-around functionality is ok as is the standard remote, the pitch control function allows you to speed up/slow down the perceived audio (I say perceived audio because no change is done to the movie speed) which is funny to play with and useful if you use the player in a PAL environment.Connectivity is ok but not impressive, as it lacks component video and optical audio jacks, the player DOES have a ZOOM feature (tech data is wrong) and the manual is simple but complete.Manufactured in China and backed by a well known Korean brand, this player is everything you need if you are more concerned about watching movies than about buying the ultimate techno-hype."
5,great machine,THis machine was so good I sold my other dvd's and bought 2 of these. It plays everything I want --- including SVCD and MP3 --It could use some GUI inprovement for MP3 .. and a remote on/off-other then that the unit is the best I've used..
3,good for a few months,"I purchased this player back in Feb. for the first few months it was fine. Played MP3s, VCDs, CD-Rs, DVD-Rs, and more. Then about a month ago whenever I watch a DVD, within the first 10 mins, the subtitles pop on. This happens with about half of my DVDs. I'll go to the root menu and turn off the subtitles, start up the film again, and within the next 10 mins, the subtitles will pop up again. It has also started glitching on some MP3 CDs. Unfortunately, there was no warranty for this. Should of held out for a better one."
4,Good for the price,"I must say for the price it is a very good player... I found the remote a little hard to use. The stop, fast forward and rewind buttons are at the bottom while the play is in the middle. Difficult to use in the dark.In watching one movie I could not get the subtitles to stop showing up based on my preference. I had to keep turning it off via the remote....I am happy with this one."
1,"Defines ""You Get What You Pay For""","This unit defines the, ""You get what you pay for,"" philosophy. I purchased this player as a second unit for a bedroom but have been unable to view more than 45 minutes of any DVD before it freezes up and can not be recovered other than powering off the unit and powering back on. Sometimes picture and sound would be completely lost and no response to controls would work. Other times picture would vanish leaving audio playback only.A great lesson in consumer spending to be learned here.... it looks great though. Just don't turn it on."
3,Mixed,"I have mixed feelings about this book. On one hand I really liked the discussion of persistence models using J2EE. It was a great tutorial on the various options a J2EE developer has when dealing with databases. On the other hand, I'm disappointed that there wasn't more lower level type discussions. I ended the book feeling as if the ""best practice"" in Java database development is to avoid direct database development altogether and let an application server deal with it for me.I develop standalone client/server type database applications more than anything else. I very rarely touch an application server. And unfortunately, only 2 or 3 chapters in this book were useful to me. Everything else was application server specific.If you're doing straight JDBC development, skip this book and go for a pure JDBC book, as you'll not really get anything new or useful here. If you develop web applications, this book is definitely right up your alley."
3,Has a rushed-to-press feel,"This book has the potential to become a ""must have"" book in a future edition. But the current edition has the feel of a book that was rushed to press without really being ready. Some of the best practices are not well explained or even explained at all. Occasionally, they are not worded carefully enough or even seem to contradict each other. The syntax errors (which are more common in the tutorial chapters) highlight this rushed feel.Overall, though, I think the book has useful content, and I learned some neat stuff from it. I'm hoping that another, more carefully written and reviewed edition gets published."
3,"Should have been called ""Review and Comparison of Java ...""",This book barely scratches the surface of the persistence domain.There is a review and brief comparison of different approaches but by no means an in-depth account for each.Still searching for that perfect book...
5,A good choice,I really like reading this book. This book discusses a lot of database concepts. The author talks about how to use the javax.sql libraries. I found the book easy to read. I found the snippets of code useful. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn advanced concepts on databases with JAVA.Michael
3,Good for a beginner,"This was the first machine I owned (other than an antique Singer dated back to the 1920's). I still have it and am saving it for my daughter when she begins to learn to sew. Its a good beginner machine. You get what you pay for, and I paid $100 bucks for it at wal-mart. Its no Janome or Husqvarna..... but it works, and you do get plenty of stitch options. It has a needle threader... which I LOVED, and winding the bobbin is really really simple."
1,twice to the shop in 6 months - not happy,"We bought this sewing machine in March and my wife is learning to sew. We do not use the machine very often so it is very disappointing that we are now on our second visit to the shop. The first one happened just within the 90 day warranty, and we were able to send to official center 60 miles away. That problem was clearly a manufacturing defect where a part came loose inside. This second problem is the actual sewing is now not correct. Appears to be a tension problem, but everything appears ok. At this point, we are on the edge of buying a new machine that is more robust. I will wait and see what the shop says tomorrow. Could cost us more to fix it than it's worth. Timing is terrible, as my wife started a class two days ago. The reliability of this product is unacceptable. Very unhappy. (Are all the new machines plastic now? Miss the old metal units and metal bobbins)."
4,Lady Thief,"I enjoyed this book very much. It was on the light reading side of one of the types I like, but It made me laugh. If you want to read something but have fun doing it I recommend this book."
3,Learn to pronounce Spanish before you narrate,I wanted to use this series for an undergraduate course but the narrator of the series butchers the Spanish names of cities and places so badly that I will not use it.
1,Misleading,"This history of Cuba is totally misleading. The chapter titled The Conquistadores was not only misleading but also inaccurate. The writer tried to put together a complex history in a very short time. Among the misleading scenes were several showing Maya Indians in Cuba. There are no Indians in Cuba now, and the Mayas were never inhabitants of Cuba. The author overemphasized the oppression of the Spaniards,and incorrectly portrayed the Cuba before Castro as a two-class country with low morality. In reality the Cuba before Castro was prosperous with a strong middle class. The author neglected to compare these with the oppression, poverty and lack of morality that exists in the Cuba of today. He neglected to mention that prostitution, gambling, and criminal activity are rampant in Castro's Cuba. His portrayal of Fidel Castro and his men as heroes is far from believable. This is propaganda piece from the Castro Regime. If you are interested in the history of Cuba, check your local library."
1,Pure Rubbish,"This video contains selective, fictional accounts of Cuba's history... Not to mention the photos of the ""aboriginal peoples"" of Cuba are not those of Cuba. Yet another BFS piece of rubbish"
3,Les is mor,"Les, les. Listen you. Pork Soda I listen once, twice, hah. Keep lisnin. Man. Wow. Holy shwowallagabonga!Like too sausage? EEEEyah!So maybe OWAW (oh wow) be once, twice, hah. You keep lesnin snake! You keep on, heah? BUT YES!Zappa zappa zappa he keep rollin along some eh some ARRGGGH. Same Les now. You be good, you heah?"
3,"""One Better"" makes this album better","Les Claypool is brilliant. I love all of his music. That said, this CD is a little inconsistent at times. There are better albums of his to get a hold of, whether it's his solo work or his days with Primus. But ""One Better"" is a masterpiece. If you can't download this song by itself online, then it's worth it to buy this CD. Claypool is the most important musician to alternative music since Frank Zappa, and his music probably won't be fully appreciated for decades. Much like Frank Zappa."
3,You know what you're getting....,"I'm a big Primus fan. Claypool is as unique a talent as you'll run across, no question. While I'd rather he crank Primus back up, his endless projects are pretty fun. This is the most recent I have, along with Frog Brigade. This probably stands out more, as other reviewers have pointed out. ""One Better"" is pure Les, and you always have some of the strangest things ever to come out of a human being on his albums. ""Iowan Gal"" is a decent example of that, he's part Looney Tune, part South Park, clearly doesnt take himself too seriously. And he sure does get a kick out of that Beavis and Butthead show...."
2,Stick to his older material,"Of Whales and Woe is Les Claypool's most recent album. I have only been a fan of Primus for a few years now, but Claypool's solo material just doesn't compare to his past works. Most of the songs have nice little tunes to them, but not all are good (Vernon, Back Off Turkey), and the lyrics are just terrible. One Better practically gives a lesson about the Sputnik satellite. Stick with his material from 1989-1998 (Suck on This through Rhinoplasty, Sausage, and Holy Mackeral), and ignore the rest."
4,brea-lynn pandora of athens,This book is about a young girl named Pandora who is adjusting to becoming a women. I like this book because it is based on real life and what can really happen instead of somthing made up. I would recommend this book to other people because it is a good story and I learned some stuff about another place in the world while reading it.By : Brea-Lynn
3,Lame--Just Lame,"I wanted to like this--we certainly need good historical fiction for kids, and there's little on Greece or Rome--but this is not what I would have liked.I know this is series writing, but the author seems to have been writing it on remote.The writing style is flat and surprisingly amateurish, and the characters are not involving in the least.Socrates seems dragged into the book as device, nothing more.This may be suitable for kids needing historic fiction--but it will not get them interested in the period. I'd definitely recommend Caroline Lawrence's Roman mysteries over these--they bring their time setting vividly to life while telling a good story kids can ENJOY reading!"
4,Shows Promise for Interesting Series...,"Pandora of Athens was very well done. The reader may be lost in a few parts, but the basic plot is beautiful.It illustrates the average life of a thirteen year old girl living in Greece in 399 B.C. Pandora lives in an era in which women have few rights and are not respected, which she resents. She also resents the fact that upon her fourteenth birthday she will have to marry a man twice her age, her cousin, who is quite lothesome himself.A good addition to the collection of Historical Fiction.It shows promise for a one-to-watch kind of series."
2,Pandora of Athens,"Pandora of AthensPandora of Athens is about a thirteen-year-old girl who is going to have to marry her cousin, who is twice as old as she is. This book takes place in Athens, Greece in 399 B.C. Pandora really wants to become more of the community by helping other people. Women back then had to pull the water out of the well and do the cleaning. Hauling water up from the well was hard but Pandora enjoyed it. One day she went down to the well to pull up the water and there was a man named Socrates who changed her life. He gave Pandora hope. Pandora's bother was always getting to do cool things but know she wanted a turn. Socrates said that women should work and not just sit at home knitting. The rich theme of pursuing your dreams is great, but the book was slow and boring to read. Pandora of Athens could be a better read if the author made the plot go faster, and made the characters more colorful."
3,Not too bad.,"This was a bit too short, I would have liked a little more story to it especially at the end, but it was a good read, and didn't take too long to finish it."
2,What a shame,"The idea is *so* cool, and the Archos guys are *this* close to getting it right. The sound is great, the ease of use is amazing (plug in USB, see drive, drop song in place, play).But that's as close as they get - the finish of the unit, the crappy controls, the hopeless manual, and last but not least the fact that the thing fails repeatedly after only a couple of months use renders it pretty much a waste of money IMHO...Shop around for something better, or wait until Archos get purchased by some big name tech outfit that can deliver the QA and support required for a device of this kind."
4,I wouldn't be without it...,"I agree with Dan...many of the complaints listed here reflect user issues, which indicates to me that Archos needs to improve their instructions and tech support. I first bought the Jukebox 6000 and was so pleased we now have the 6000, the 6 gig player/recorder, and the Studio 20 in our house.I personally don't care much for MusicMatch, so I just drag and drop my folders into the jukebox. As for battery life, we haven't encountered any problems, and usually get a good 10 hours of play time.The Studio 20 gave me some error messages at first, but I would just disconnect, reboot the computer, and didn't have any more problems.I use mine as a back-up hard drive regularly, and with 20 gigs, there's still plenty of room for music. When I had to reformat my hard drive, all I did was transfer my files to the Jukebox, then reinstall. It was a breeze.I can't speak to the problems others have had, but we all love ours."
2,Wouldn't this be nice...,"I bought this product despite the bad reviews and warnings. And it was a great mp3 player. For a week. After just a few days, it stopped working completely. 6 GB is more that enough for my entire music collection; I just can't get to it any more. If you like to gamble with your money, go for this. You might get lucky. If you want something that is guaranteed to work, try a different mp3 player."
1,"VERY UNRELIABLE, EXPECT TORTURE","I bought an Archos Jukebox 6000 from Amazon in July, it had repeated ""Hard Drive Error"" problems, Archos instructed me to return it to Amazon.I bough an Archos Jukebox recorder from Amazon in November, basically a similar story.Both times there was a lot of TORTURE with recharging batteries, reformatting the hard drive, re-installing firmware, etc etc. I think this would be a beautiful device if it actually worked, but it DOESN'T. The chance is VERY high that you will take it on a trip and it will break down, and you will be unhappy.Also, Archos tech support is THE WORST I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED. VERY DIFFICULT to reach, and very unhelpful.Again, I wish this beautiful little device actually worked -- for the money, it is a wonderful deal.M./"
1,What a waste,"We bought three of these things for three different family members for Christmas in 2001. I just came across one of them in a ""junk"" drawer and am throwing it out. Just wanted to write this review now just in case anyone is looking at this item. All three of these mp3 players broke within 3 months after Christmas. The button became stuck on one of them, another just shut down completely and the third's screen scrambled after a few months. Waste of time and money."
2,Neat player while it worked!!,"I had the archos 6GB player/recorder for just a couple of days. It was very neat while it worked though :) did not have much trouble getting it setup and transferring files, listening to music etc. The user manual does not help much much is probably quite sufficient for people using digital gadgets. It is definitely much smaller than the Nomad and I chose it for the form factor. The complaint I have is that it just stopped working abruptly after a couple of days. Started displaying a message saying that there was a hardware error. So I just had it returned. And this was without even having done any jogging/any thing out of the normal that would cause shock to the player. On the whole, I would definitely love to have this product if only it worked reliably.."
1,Disappointing performance/non-existent customer service,"I read the good reviews for this player, and the solitary poor review. The odds were in my favor, so I took a chance and purchased this product. Big mistake.In the two days I have owned this product, it has worked only one hour. It refused to read a lot of files, but it *did* hold a lot of data. I just can't get to any of it. Twenty-four hours after I opened the box, it started freezing while reading files, and I had to restart it. Finally, it refused to work at all and froze upon booting up. It exhibited all of the problems that a previous reviewer had commented upon.The toll-free customer service phone number has been disconnected.I am beginning to believe that all of the good reviews for this product were written by Archos employees or advertisers. I would suggest that a would-be purchaser steer clear of this product, and anything produced by this company."
2,"Lots of Potential, but Fell Short","I was excited when I ordered this item, and even more excited when I received it. I followed the directions and set it up..but after 2 days of minor use it locked up constantly when booting up, and I heard strange pinging noises (the hard drive?) when I turned it on.Some time I would get these symptoms, other times not. When it worked, it was wonderful. Maybe I pressed the wrong buttons? I may buy one when the model is upgraded or some major firmware updates are offered.Loved shopping through Amazon.com!"
3,Is it Really worth it?,"A friend of mine has this jukebox, and has had some issues. I bought the Classic Juke box through Circuit City, and it works like a champ + more memory.. 10gig to be exact. If your not interested in transferring files directly from your CD player, you might want to look at e.Digitals Treo 10. You can do a search on edig.com."
4,"Awsome, but not perfect","Let me start by saying that if you spend the money, you will be satisified. The player works great, sounds great, and is fairly easy to operate. Anyone with more than a little computer experience will catch on quickly. When you get the unit upgrade the musicmatch software (for free) at there site. The headphones that ship with the unit are junk..Don't judge the sound quality until you hook up a better set of headphones. The instruction manual is almost useless, but the unit is pretty simple to figure out through trial and error. I have not been able to make the unit skip, the buffer works great. Store your entire music collection, plug it into your home stereo and it will blow you away. On a one to five scale:Headphones ....2Instruction Manual ...1Jukebox .....5Overall ...4+"
2,BURKE HAS DONE BETTER!!!!,"Maybe it was just me but I never could really get into this book. This is the eighth Robicheaux I have read and in my openion one of the worst. I think there were to many people involved, you almost need a program to keep up with them. To many dreams by Dave. Who is the problem? Is it Sweet Pea Cahrisson, Sonny Boy Marsallus, Johnny Carp, Moleen Bertrand, Rufus Arceneauxn, Emile Pogue or John Giacano and this is not all the players. There are about three or four stories going on at the amse time also. Graves being dug up, people being put off their land, chemicals being destroyed. To many stories and to many people for an old person to keep up with. Sorry, Burke."
4,Burke on less-than-top form is still pretty splendid,"Not quite the best of the Robicheaux series - that would be either A MORNING FOR FLAMINGOs or A STAINED WHITE RADIANCE - but James Lee Burke's second-best books are still more powerful, more moving, and more vivid than most writers' first-best.As always with the saga of Dave ""Streak"" Robicheaux and the lowlife elements he encounters, Burke excels at character delineation and at conveying the phosphorescent, putrid atmosphere of Huey Long territory. Fans of Cletus ""Noble Mon"" Purcel - with his truly poetic capacity for invective - will be glad to know that he's back, as is the still dirtier-mouthed Helen Soileau, who unexpectedly reveals a vulnerable side here.Precious few living novelists can make me buy their work purely on the strength of their name. Burke's one of the few."
3,A low point in the Robicheaux series,"I've been reading the Robicheaux series in order and liked it so far, but this book was not up par with the others I've read. By comparison with the previous books, I found the plot disjointed and the dialog wooden.I also thought The ""Vietnam angst"" was imagery overdone and cliche'. In addition, I felt that characters of Helen, Terry, Emile and Rufus were introduced abruptly into story line, and either given weak character development, or only developed later in the story. I think a basic error in this genre is to have a minor, poorly developed character be important to the outcome. Finally, I'm still not sure of all the details of what happened in the story and I thought I read it pretty carefully. I'd would have liked to see more of the loose ends tied up.If you're a real Robicheaux fan you should probably read it for continuity but I wouldn't recommend this as your first book in the series."
4,Family Roots Go Deep,"BURNING ANGEL by James Lee Burke has Deputy Dave Robicheaux digging deep into the dark secrets of Louisana's past.Families and generations mix and fall, the mob controls the projects and the girls. Sonny Boy Marsallus has a different scale of values that does not fit the scene. He calls Dave when things become hotter than an August day.James Lee Burke's plots are twisted, but seem almost the same from book to book, which does distract from their excellance.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH"
4,New to Southern living and enjoying the literature of the area,"This was just another in a line of excellent books by James Lee Burke. I enjoy continuing characters but different plots and James Lee Burke gives you just enough history to attach one story to the next, if you've read more than one. But if you haven't, each storyline stands alone as well. My cousin asked me if I had read any of his books and since I hadn't when I first moved to Louisiana, I began searching for whichever titles I could find. I only wish I had read them in order of Det. Robicheaux's life so I understood more clearly what happened to him and his family. I still have a few titles to go so I'm sure I'll figure it all out and enjoy every stirring and eloquently spoken word."
3,Pretty Good until the last 30 pages,"I like Burke and the Robichaux series and I liked this one up until it completely unraveled in the last 40 pages. Nothing made sense, nothing was explained and nothing resolved. Really screwy and it left me feeling cheated. Up until the end of the book it was one of my favorites in the series but Burke left too many plot lines just hanging. It's like he just got tired of writing the story and said the hell with it and wrapped everything up in 10 pages without explanation of what or why. Too neat, too tidy, too quick and too pulp fiction-like.He did the same thing at the end of the previous entry, Dixie City Jam. I'll continue the series but not for too long if it stays like this."
3,"GREAT DESCRIPTION, SO-SO STORY","First was my first step into the world of James Lee Burke and it was a bit muddy. The book is written beautifully with great Cajun-spiced dialogue, wonderful landscape and marvelous cooking. The only problem came in the plot. The book weaves together three (or probably more) stories concerning a mysterious hitman, a mysterious landowner, and the mob. The end seemed forced and unpredictable especially since the bad guy isn't in more than ten pages of the book! Their is also a lot of over-violent Vietnam horror stories and a supernatural element that doesn't pan out in the end. Overall, I liked the book and I thought Dave was a great leading man but I am going to be hesitant in the future about reading anything else by Mr. Burke."
3,"One of the only ""ok"" books by James Lee Burke","This is one of the only books in this series I was not crazy about. Its not bad, but just not great. But don't get me wrong this is a great series."
3,"Acceptable, but not great","The pacing on this production leaves much to be desired. The orchestra can't seem to find the right way to perform Ko-Ko's songs. When the songs should be fast, the orchestra plays like it is slogging through quicksand. When the pace should be slowed down a bit to allow for some witty enunciation, the orchestra races through. John Reed is acceptable as the Lord High executioner Ko-Ko, but he tends to sing a little flat in some of his songs. However, it is complete with the overture and the little list song is largely untouched. But these complaints aside, the music and words are still able to shine through. That's enough to make it a passable recording."
4,Great G&S,"This is my personal favourite of the G&S operettas, I have seen it performed multiple times and have loved the new adaptations as well and the original D'oyly Carte version. I have to say that there are so many different versions of the original score that I have had to scout around to find the one that I like the best and this is it."
3,An average Mikado,"Firstly, it must be said that Nash and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra have done an excellent job. Orchestration is crisp and clear, if occasionally the victim of inconsistent tempi. The reason for this recording's mediocre score are the few black spots in an otherwise exellent cast. Specifically, I found Colin Wright's Nanki-Poo to have much too much vibrato, but those accustomed to more operatic performers may appreciate this; I just though it inappropriate for the lighter, comical fare of Gilbert and Sullivan. Valerie Masterson and John Reed are excellent, as expected. A more rounded historical stereo recording would be the recently remastered and re-released 1957 from Sounds on CD. Otherwise, I would go with Mackerras or New D'Oyly-Carte, the former winning out due to its greater commitment to authenticity. Stay away from Sargent, unless, like me, you are a completist."
2,Rip Off,"Wildly unbalanced volume levels. Also goes for London's ""Pirates"" & ""Patience"". Takes all the enjoyment out of G&S. Try & get another label. Don't buy these three unless you are good at holding your nose. I was very disappointed at the overall production quality."
5,Good Quality,"I was nervous about buying a shirt on the internet - sometimes the quality can be less than that in the stores, but I was suprised! Great quality and nice shirt!"
1,Not really for roller rocker arms,"This is a poor off shore attempt to copy yet another US designed product in use for decades. Too bad they forgot to measure the inside diameter of a quality roller rocker arm like a Comp Cams stainless steel model. If they would have, then they would have turned down the diameter of the end that holds down the pivot to the correct size to go into it. As they are, they don't work and won't allow proper valve adjustment unless modified to fit. I recommend buying a quality US made brand."
3,Too much censoring!!!,"While I agree that this movie is one of Sellers' best, I was very disapointed to find that it had been heavily censored for this Austrailian release. I am glad to have what's left of the movie on DVD, but part of it's charm is in the ethnic humor and crude language that has been removed, as well as the footage of the ""Big, Beautiful T*ts"" that Hopfnagle has become enslaved to. I still have a Betamax copy of the complete movie, but I wish someone would release it intact on NTSC DVD. Did the AMA have this movie banished from America? I wonder..."
4,"Dark satire, a good mature Sellers film","This film is a satire about the American health service of the time and the effects of capitalism in it. As black comedies go it achieves black farce at times and I think that the points it makes are worth making. This is not a cinema masterpiece technically like Hoffman or The Optimists but like these it is a mature Sellers classic that has been completely under rated. Apparently the Region 2 version is edited, so hopefully the Americans will produce a proper edition."
2,peter sellers dvd,"Well, I can't really review the product, since after sending it back twice to the seller, I found I couldn't play ""that region"" dvd on mystateside player. The seller ""suggested"" I buy (make another purchase?) an all-region player to play this dvd.After ""serious"" consideration, I determined I won't buy another player just to play this dvd, and need no other purchases to be made.I assume my refund was credited to my account, although I never got areply from the seller."
2,missed its mark,I had no idea why this film was so revered or feared until I learned how this version had been edited. Too bad. It had potential to be funny but was NOT. Sellers is funny most of the time but this one was boring. The premise that profit driven medical payment systems cause severe social problems is a well documented issue - enough that he thought it was something he could make fun of. Too bad it is not funny at all. We need to put care back in Health Care and leave profit for Coca Cola and United Airlines.
2,Back to the Future???,"No wonder this tragic comedy of doing money in medicine had fallen from grace in the States where pinching cents on national health care while wasting billiards to please overseas warlords is steady a hot issue, these days especially.A team of Jewish characters embedded a way a local medical help had then been provided, peppering this cynic story with rude sexism and nice music."
3,Delicious candy but be aware of issues...,"I normally purchase this candy locally and was happy to be able to purchase from Amazon at a discount. Unfortunately, it appears I had a 'funny' batch. The first bag I had was perfect, but the second bag seemed to have been rancid or something. Some pieces from the bag had a very strong chemical taste."
3,waxy texture,I bought these due to the high reviews. They had a waxy texture and were ok but not worth 5 stars.
2,uneven glaze but happily LARGE size,I ended up sending these cups back because the uneven glaze bothered me - I could see drip marks running down the sides. But they are a happy huge size. 21 ounces.
1,Buy it if you're into self-loathing,Caught this movie at a horror film fest in San Francisco. Have no idea why TLA Releasing would pick up this movie as the message is being gay makes you a homicidal manic and/or a sexual deviant with no societal redeeming values and you're going to hell. A turd sprinkled with shiny production values makes it a movie anyone from the religious right would love. Skip it.
4,Wisdom from a remarkable teacher,"""Be Free Where You Are,"" by Thich Nhat Hanh, is a short book. In a foreword, Sister Chan Khong notes that what follows is a transcription of a talk that the author gave to inmates at the Maryland Correctional Institute at Hagerstown on 16 Oct. 1999. The text also contains a question-and-answer session and an appendix with comments by a few attendees of the talk.In this book Thich Nhat Hanh talks about ""the energy of mindfulness,"" meditation, his life as a Buddhist monk, the Three Jewels of the Buddhist tradition, his own poetry, and related topics. His words are tender, kind, and peaceful, and at times gently poetic. Recommended for readers of any religious or spiritual background, but especially for those with an interest in Buddhism."
5,Be Free Where You Are,"A exceptional book that encapsulates simple practices that are explained succinctly & beautifully. This book can help anyone (of any faith) to acheive happiness & peace. Whatever your situation this book is a touchstone for connecting with a LIFESPRING within & around you. A practical book that's a meditation in itself. The powerful techniques outlined can be practiced anywhere to plug into joy. Plus, it's short and takes you ""there"" consistently, quickly & easily."
4,Great!,Very insightful and a pleasure to read. Shows us that you can be free no matter where you are or what predicament you may find yourself in.
3,Cute but cost too much...,"Very cute dish, but I feel it's worth more like $9.99 or less. However I did go to Orson and Gygi's in Salt Lake, Utah and their prices were higher for the same product. So I guess it wasn't too bad. If the base of the dishes were higher I would like it more. I display desserts on these dishes and would like some room to place more of them on each level of the platters when I stack them. Serves it's purpose on it's own."
1,Bad Business....!,"I have ordered 2 items ""Tommy Girl Women's Livi Runner, White Signature, 5 M "". But I just received only one of them. I really fell unhappy when I go to shoping with Amazon.Hoppully you guy will improve your businesss as soon as possible"
2,Beware,"This book claims to be Video and Audio...the audio part is ca. 20 pages out of 300, is horribly outdated, and is not technical enough to explain psychoacoustic principles involved..it is generally substandard. The video parts also neglect the 'reasons' for various techiniques. The book serves as a compendium of techniques without providing underpinnings.A beautiful quote 'Mpeg 3 was dropped ... etc' Only if you have the limited point of view of this book....it should called 'Video with Audio' not 'Video and Audio'. There is a BIG difference.In many respects, DVD Demystified provides more useful figures and information.Not recommended."
4,Great Overview,I found this book to be a great tool for teaching 18 year-olds the fundamentals of digital video and audio compression. It was pungent but erudite without being salacious.
5,Still enjoying...,Still enjoying this purchase that I made a few years ago. They haven't lost any of their beauty. The boxes have held up each year through the Christmas season and are just as pretty to look at as the first year.
4,recommended but be wary...,"The earlier DVD players came with a lip-synch problem on the audio. Some DVDs do not have the problem. Actor/ess mouths don't synch so there is a delay. Later, Denon fixed the problem and offered older models a firmware upgrade (which i used). Video is nice and smooth, but the audio is where it really shines. If your in the market, do yourself a favor and demo the unit first for the lip-synch...MI2,Galidator,etc... will show the flaw. Otherwise, an excellent player and the audio alone is worth the price of admission.connected through component to RPTV (non HDTV)audio through quality coxial cable to Denon receiver"
2,"Sutherland, why are you ruining Bellini?","Sutherland's diction is horrible. Her voice is droopy. Her phrasing is poor. Her drama is nearly non-existent. Her interpolated high notes unfairly hijack this opera from the other singers. Where is Sills' studio ""Norma"" with Shirley Verrett when you need it? I hope EMI releases it on CD very soon.Also, everyone keeps ranting about how Sutherland and Horne sing everything in the original keys. Keep in mind that the tones have gone up one full tone since Bellini's time. So today's key of F has the same tessitura as the key of G in Bellini's time. That means that both Callas and Caballé, singing ""Casta diva"" in today's key of F, are actually singing the aria in its ORIGINAL TESSITURA. This means that Sutherland and Horne are actually singing ABOVE the original keys (tessituras). It is wrong of them to show off like that. Upward transpositions done to show off one's singing technique are just signs of lacking taste."
3,CALLAS 20th c NORMA,Sutherland has never been theatrical. The comparison with 1954's live Callas recording is fateful. The duo with Horne here is real superbe.
5,A thrill a minute here,"No one is going to match this Norma. This is my favorite opera, and I listen to this at least once a day. Sort of like getting up in the morning. Get a load of Dame Joan and Marilyn Horne. The singing is fabulous, and the music gorgeous. Best thing I've ever heard."
2,"Boring studio recording, not necessarily singers' fault","Despite the reputation of Sutherland and Horne, one really must listen to this recording for what it is, a bland, undramatic studio recording. The singers are miked rather distantly, reverb has been added, and the engineers have managed to drain whatever remaining life out of what might have been recorded on the original tapes. In the case of both Sutherland and Horne one can barely make out one word, much less any sense of character or emotion. I have heard Sutherland live, and the effect was much different. The beautiful, effortless voice at that stage in her career had an energy and a kind of natural reverb which was in itself dramatic and exciting, and you didn't feel that anything was missing. Horne I have never found to be an interesting singer or interpreter. But similarly, in live performance it was the energy of her singing that made up for the lack of personality and the rather hard tone."
2,Quite boring,"This is a movie about a forrest worker who accidently starts a big fire with his cigarette. Soon there is panic all over and urgent help is needed. But the whole movie is totally boring. The characters are not interesting, there is absolutely no one you will really like. Donna Mills is playing a kindergarden teacher who seems to have lost a child in the fire. This is the only highlight in this movie. But mysteriously no one is really concerned about it but Donna. This drama is just a nice try to make a good action movie."
5,Cool Boulez meets fiery Scriabin,"I love this disc (which to be fair, has received very mixed comments). Boulez, with his typical focus on clarity, tackles this volcanic composer's overheated music with compelling results. It's not the only way to play Scriabin -- some may prefer a more overtly emotional thrust -- but it works.The fabulous Chicago Symphony sounds thrilling, with the gleaming brass dominating but not overpowering the dense textures. I especially like this version of ""Prometheus,"" which includes the choral part - here sung by the excellent Chicago Symphony Chorus.Other versions may sound ""more Russian"" or be more passionate, but the approach here works on its own glittery, crystalline terms."
4,Ecstatic,"The jewel case was cracked and broken on arrival, but the CD was OK. The music is about on a par with Zubin Mehta's rendition and certainly more romantic than Lorin Maazel's."
1,One satisfied customer here.,"I bought this sight unseen because I wanted a fifty million dollar business dowel briefcase that fits shuttle. It fits the airport shuttle quite nicely. Some guy stole it and it had my socks in it, so I have to buy a new one and some more socks."
5,One of the better episodes of a great series,"Lt. Goldman and his company are assigned to take Hill 1000, a hill they've taken before and lost before. It promises to be the worst battle yet and a bloody battle ensues, with one of the cast members leaving permanently.If you like Tour of Duty, or any war shows, you won't be disappointed by this episode. A good buy."
5,Great V-Day gift!,Bought this for my wife on Valentine's Day and she absolutely loved it! A great buy for that special someone in your life.
4,My Husband Has These Authors to Thank,"What a wonderful, cheerful, funny, and INFORMATIVE book! My husband has these authors to thank for keeping our marriage full of spice, surprises, and of course a little aggravation. :-) As Aristotle said: ""There is no drama without comflict."" This book helps provide the necessary ""drama"" relationships require to stay interesting. A recommended buy!"
4,"Frames mix classic rock, punk for unique sound","The Teenage Frames have simple ideals about their music. Tour, play live, be realistic, and rock. Theyre good at it too. Their newest release '1% Faster' is a showcase of quality rock and roll with classic riffs, pop hooks, punk power, and catchy lyrics. These Chicagoians write songs about life in the city, and being human. '1% Faster' consists of 14 songs with various influences ranging from the Rolling Stones to the Clash. Most of the songs are shorter than three minutes, but the album does not sound choppy. Just about anyone can relate to their lyrics, and anyone can get into their sound. Take my family for example. I like it, my dad likes it. Im 20, my dad is 55. I like punk, dad likes oldies. The Teenage Frames can appeal to such a wide variety of people, so almost anyone who likes music should check out this cd. It holds everything that rock and roll should have, but rarely does anymore. This is the way rock should be."
1,Slow shooting speed ruins this game,"I love the original Snood, so I was really looking forward to this game. Unlike the original Snood, there is a limit on how fast one is allowed to shoot. In the time allowed for one shot, I could easily get off three shots in the original game, so the game for me is: shoot, wait...wait, shoot, wait ...wait. Not much fun at all, which is too bad because some of the new formats, like the circle Snoods, look like they would be really great if not so slow. I think the only realistic audience for this game is very young children."
5,sweet little book,"I bought this for my sister who is 10 years older than me, but is very close to my heart. The words and pictures are so sweet and meaningful that when she read the book she cried!"
2,a disturbing portrait of the mentally ill,"I confess I didn't finish the book. I tried, I wanted to , but as the depth of the character's mental illness and those around her took on more and more perverse and unreal proportions, I finally had to put it down.As a daughter of Viennese Jewish holocaust refugees, I was highly motivated to continue. I was intrigued by the descriptions of pre-war Jewish life in Vienna and charmed by the Viennese locales. I hoped to strongly identify with the characters, especially the following generations. I was ultimately, however, only repelled.From what I read, I found Clara's depressions and the capitulation of those around her to the disease (although the daughter seems to be finding her way as I closed the book) abhorrent.Maybe the subject is too personal and I was looking for strength and heroines, however I would warn potential readers to tread carefully unless you are a fan of the dark side of the psyche."
2,Too Many Gaps,"The author clearly does not understand heterosexual love and/or heterosexual sexuality, and skips over too many important details, specifically, why the grandmother and her gay husband conceived a child."
4,Great read,"Easy to read book with comical anticdotes. Not really as ""helpful"" as I thought it would be but definitely makes you think about your home business and helps you get other WAHM perspectives. I plan on recommending this to my friends and family."
4,The truth about working at home,"I have enjoyed both of Cheryl's books because they are written in a personal, easy to read fashion and they provide the reality of what its like to work-at-home! I have been working at home for over 14 years and providing work-at-home information and resources online for over 7, so I know a worthwhile book when I find it. Cheryl's book provides great information on how to work-at-home as well as tips on how to make it work. Far from being ""pie-in-the-sky"", working at home doesn't always solve the family/work balance challenge. But Cheryl provides a humorous approach on developing the best work-at-home scenario possible."
1,SUCKS!!!,"This TV is not an LCD...its a mammoth....13.7"" thick come on..i canget a projection tv thinnner than that...and its heavy, 75 lbs! compared to similiar 40-50 lb tvs. the pics on the syntax site are decieving....they dont show how thick it really is..dont buy and spend the extra money on quality lcd tv....you can tell that all the reviews here are from Syntax salesmen trying to hype this tv up...my review is the only true one. yeah its cheap...but you get what you pay for."
2,Resolution to low.,Why not offer full 1080i/p resolution at this size.Should be 1920 x 1080. Anything less and you will want to upgrade very soon because these TV's don't support native HD.
2,DO NOT BUY,Can not be connected to Direct TV and probably cable. Over 150 TVs on the lisy that can be formatted but not Olevia.
1,Unreliable,"After ten months of ownership I can agree with everyone that this tv has a spectacular picture, when there is a picture. Replaced once under warranty, repaired once more and now broken again for the third time. Quality control is clearly not an issue with these people. Customer service works well after you get though to them, assuming you get through at all. Save your money until you can afford a set from one of the big names, they cannot afford reviews like this, apparently Syntax could not care less."
2,Not what I wxpected.,"The back side is OPEN. It only covers the front & sides. It should say that the back side is open. Other than that & the fact that it is slightly bigger than my 17"" flt screen iMac computer."
5,Clear Vinyl Dust Cover,"This cover exceeds my expectations. Even though it is rated for 19"" monitors there is still some wiggle-room on the sides. Just for chuckles, I tried it on my wife's 22"" monitor. Worked prefectly. So I gave her the one I tried, and purchased another for my 19"" monitor."
1,And YET ANOTHER Misleading BFS video,"Yet another video full of SUBJECT statements blaming ALL of Cuba's ills on the USA... yes, the USA has done Cuba some wrong, but much of the history in this entire video series misleading at best. Uses video footage from the other videos in the set. For pete's sake, pick up a good history book and dont rely on this rubbish video series!"
4,Love this dog.,"The writing in this book is great! Perfect for reading to a child, the end is a bit silly with the people and the baby getting involved. I really though the dog was best on his own. The illustrations of the Wet Dog are fabulously endearing, he is just so cute, and captures that doggie-joy so well. I do find the baby that plays a key role at the end of the book to be too stylized and rather creepy in its mushroom-head bonnet. But still, a fun fun book. Good for a summer read to a child."
1,not really useful in a real ceremony,Anyone who is thinking of buying this book to actually use these arrangements at a ceremony STOP.....the playing is great but the problem is to many dropped D and dropped D&G; songs.(A string dropped to G)How can you retune your guitar while the ceremony is taking place!!!!!!exampleCanon in D dropped Dhere comes the bride dropped D&G;thenWedding march in Concert tuning????????????these three songs normally follow each other when I'm performing at a ceremonynot a lot of thought was put into the practical use of these songsreturning for a refund
4,Good debut,"Good pop by Elisa Fiorillo who had a hit with ""Who found who"" with Jellybean and later joined Prince."
2,"Content=Great! Hell is a songscraftsman, punk or otherwise. Sound=BRICKWALLED","As others have posted here with their reviews, Spurts: The Richard Hell Story, is a fantastic compilation of his career, solo, Neon Boys, Voidoids, etc. As is the case with any compilation, there is always a track or two that one would want to substitute, but there is only so much you can fit on 1 compact disc. Punk style aside, Hell is a song craftsman which is often overlooked. ""Time"" is a masterpiece that I played over and over when I had the 45rpm single. As much as I love the songs here, the mastering is awful. This music is supposed to be loud, but it was not meant to be compressed and limited so much that it is painful to listen to. So 5 amazon stars for content, 2 for sound."
5,I'm A Big Fan So Don't Get Me Wrong,"But, I've been thinking about it and I think that if Richard Hell really was punk rock he would have changed his name to Dick Heaven.The CD? It's gooooood. (The dude from Sonic Youth is the worst guitarist on the whole thing. Seriously.)"
3,What is this movie about?,"I must first admit that I bought this film only because Deborah Harry makes a brief appearance. The film is disjointed. There is not one story line but several. It is more like watching a series of short films based on short stories with the suitcase thrown in only as a link. There is no common theme. If you like experimental cinema, then you may enjoy it. You can debate whether there was in fact a point for bringing these stories together in one film."
4,Great entry level Dolby 5.1 receiver...,"I've had this receiver for about a year and I really like it. If you're looking for a good quality entry level receiver that sounds great but isn't a ""nut rumbler,"" this Denon would be a great choice. It gets only four stars because it comes with quite possibly the most abysmal remote I've ever encountered. More than one optical input would be nice, but it's not too big of a problem."
4,pretty good,Reanimation Festival is not the Ghoules best CD but it has its high points. Graveyard Girlfriend is amazing and To Go Home is probably their best cover song. If you are a Ghoulies fan already you should buy it but if you are just getting into them buy Fun In The Dark which is their best. Oh yeah- buy every album by the muffs because they are the best band ever to hit the scene.
3,filter noise but not phone call itself,"this filter out noise only. but when you make phone call, the conversation breaking up. so, i put this one at the phone (e.g. basemenet phone) that i hardly use to make/receive phone calls."
4,Divine Divinity PC,Old style RPG with quests and sub quests. Cross between ultima and diablo. I have enjoyed this game very much. I don't know how I missed buying this game when this is my favorite type of game.
2,Click to kill gets old,"Much like Diablo and even Neverwinter Nights, this game falls short when it comes to engaging playing. Because you only have control of one or two characters, this game becomes nothing more than ""click on the moster to kill it."""
2,Not that great..,"I agree with other purchasers of this case..best use is as a dust cover, not a carrying case. It's hard to close..trying to fit the lid into the flimsy grooves on the bottom is a pain and it's very thin. I was worried the sewing machine would fall out while walking as it slides around inside. I purchased it for my daughter so it served it's purpose as her first sewing machine and case but I wish cases were still made like the fitted one on my old Burnina. Now that sturdy, fitting case was what I'd call quality! You could just remove the top and sew, it fit the sewing machine perfectly and even had storage in the bottom. This cheap thing should have been given free with purchase of a sewing machine."
2,"Cost: $30, Value: $5","Unlike the old cases where the machine snugly fits inside and the lid over it, This is an inexpensive piece of plastic with latches on the sides. The machine just sits on a plastic grid bottom with nothing to cradle or hold it in, so it can bounce around inside when walking or if tipped over. As for walking with it, the handle in strangely and cheaply made. There are ridges for grips, but they don't work well since they are raised ridges which dent your fingers when you hold it, due to the weight of the machine. If you're moving it in a short distance (across a room) then you're not holding it long enough to hurt your fingers. Hmm, can't find much good about it, except it is a good dust cover. Why would Singer make such nice machines and skimp on the carrying case? It is the type of quality that would be given away at no charge, with the purchase of a machine."
4,Good for the price,"I bought this for my teen daughter to take back and forth to sewing club and is a bit bulky for her, but is functional."
5,A true bargain!,"A novice sewer with a basic machine, I wanted a simple case to hold the machine and its accessories. This one is perfect! It's nothing fancy, to be sure, but it does its job well. The case latches easily on both sides, and my machine, foot pedal, instruction manual, and accessory box all fit inside perfectly. It's easy to carry, lightweight, and the price is low. What more could you ask for? I highly recommend this item to anyone looking for a basic case for their machine!"
1,What a Waste!,"Because it's ""universal,"" the machine would be loose inside this case instead of tightly fitting into a molded space. I judged it to be virtually useless, therefore, and returned it immediately for refund. My recommendation to you is simple: don't bother."
4,you need this if you have sewing machine,"recently bought Singer sewing machine - you must have this item, to carry and store the machine and accessories.Good quality and price."
3,It's a case,"What can I say, it's a case, it works just fine for your sewing machine. It's not top of the loine but it will do the job."
3,not very compact,it is difficult to put under the end table where my other one lived forever. also i wish the machine would mount to this case but it doesn't. the handle could be far more compact. but its a sturdy case.
3,"Good Price, Decent Quality","This case is great for storing at home but if you're traveling or moving it a lot, it may be a good idea to get another one. It doesn't hold the sewing machine in place if knocked over. Still could damage the machine. Overall, a good product especially for the price and protects against things falling on it."
2,"Dust cover, not a carrying case","I bought this case as a cover for my machine a few years ago, and it was great for storing my machine when I wasn't using it very much. In the past 6 months I've started taking classes, and taking my machine with me, in this case. The handle is the MOST uncomfortable design. It's astonishing... I created my own ""padding"" handle so I can carry it further than a couple feet without pain in my fingers. My machine is not very heavy, it's just an awful design.It gets two stars instead of one simply because if you plan on putting your machine away, and never carrying it further than a couple feet, then it's probably an alright case."
2,Basically a plastic shell,"I wondered how this could fit so many different machines - what you have here is a large plastic shell that you lift the sewing machine into for storage. There is no way to secure the machine to the bottom (which seems rugged enough to hold the weight) but please note, as observed by another reviewer, that your machine is then 'loose' inside the box and will likely need some sort of protective padding to prevent it from rocking around inside the case it you are actully planning to use this to transport the machine, not to mention securing the pedal and cords. The latches appear to be sturdy. I haven't had it for long enough to really give it a testing as to the quality of the plastic.I couldn't find another Singer case, so I guess this is it..."
5,Sewing machine carrying case,"I am a new, yet old seamstress. Sewed years ago on old Singer. Bought new one recently, and it didn't have a case. I was delighted to find this one at Amason, although a little nervous given some of the negative reviews. I find this carrying case to be just fine--it fits very nicely, is easy to use and to carry, and is plenty sturdy enough for my needs. It's also a great value for the money. I'd recommend it to anyone who does not need an extremely sturdy case."
5,Just what I needed,"When I bought my new machine, I found that they no longer come with the case(!!) This product fills the bill. It protects it better than the cloth ones for a very reasonable price. I have younger kids and they can be rough on the things that are around them/ I don't have to worry about my sewing machine, it is safe in it's case!"
2,Singer 611 Universal Carrying Case,I was not very pleased with this case. The handle looks like its missing a part and there is no cushion on it for ease on lifting.
2,Singer 611 Universal Carrying Case,"I works OK. It's cheap and it's effecent. I don't think I would have bought, though, it if I had know it has staples to attach the metal to the plastic."
2,Check your state laws before buying,"I bought 2 of these, but didn't have enough of some letters. If you shake the frame a certain way, then the letters slide over/under each other if not secured. I regret not checking my state's laws before buying; if I use it on my car then I could get fined because it blocks over a certain % of my state's name. Now the frame is just in the box in the garage. :("
4,A fun look back,"I remember Aurora kits from the early 60's. Crude compared to Revell or Monogram but I thought airplanes were cool and any model seemed like a good way to involve oneself. I remember this book, too. Well, sort of. It has been nearly 45 years since the last time I saw one. It's a plug for Aurora, of course and a reminder of how simplistic building a model was. Judging by a magazine like Fine Scale Modeler, things have changed just a little! LOL As the title of this review says, the book is a fun look back 45 years and little else. BTW Aurora went out of business 30 years ago and the kits are now highly collectable. The most fun image from this book HAS to be the Avro CF-105 model coming in for a landing over a large ashtray; complete with smoking cigar beneath (with an admonition not to get the model too close to that hot cigar... D'oh!) Times have certainly changed!"
5,My Hope,"Was familiar with the excellent title song, ""My Hope,"" which is about 10 years old and is why we wanted the album. That and one other song, ""He Knows My Name,"" are the best and really only spectacular songs on this CD, in our view. There is something very special about them. We can play these two cuts again and again without tiring of them, and get inspired and blessed from them each time --real good stuff. I wish this California band, if they are still together, would produce another album with more songs of the spirit and skill of ""My Hope"" and ""He Knows My Name."""
1,Apples to Apples,"I would like to try this product but unfortunately I can't find the dose per caplet. To make a logical choice I need to know what dose is contained in each pill or caplet. It's bad enough that they are some times given in ""units"" and sometimes mg but when there is nothing how can an informed consumer make an informed decision?"
1,".""La Equally""","only one question - where is opera and drama ? i'm tired of Dame Joan boring singing! this is exhibition of high notes! and for her it doesn't matter what is this opera about or what senses are expressed by music.""La Equally"""
3,Silly Slapstick Humor,"Don't get fooled that this being a John Woo film that this has guns and action. There is action, but not gun fighting or kung fu. It's humor, the dumbest kind of humor. It's still funny, but it's just good for wasting extra time with. The humor in this movie is probably out dated and would be found funny mostly by HK movie veterans. I still recommend it if you want to see some really dumb funny Chinese flicks. If you want really good Chinese comedy, I recommend Stephen Chow movies. If you want Chinese comedy with a horror twist, I recommend the ""Mr. Vampire"" movies. **Choi Keen**"
3,A good starter kit,"If you sew or quilt, tool storage is always a problem. Singer's sewing kit makes a nice thread organizer, and for a beginner or for simple repair kit, it's great. Yet for most hobbyists, it's a great storage case that falls a bit short on ""essentials."" You'll want to substitute your own tools, such a decent pincushion, good-quality thread and metal and leather thimbles that fit your fingers."
4,Great starter!,"I just recently bought this with my first sewing machine and it's a great starter package!It came with all the basic's that I needed in order to start sewing.It's compact, handy, and great quality for the price. I would suggest buying a few more things to add to this but this case comes with plenty of extra storage compartments to put all your small essentials in for starting out.For the hobbyists it seems like a great economical storage kit even if you want to switch out whats in there for your own.Overall I would defonitly recomment this kit for anyone starting out, and/or anyone looking for a nice storage unit."
4,Great kit,The colors are very bright but great kit for a beginner like myself.BUT ...... when i first opened it I didn't realize that the thread would fall out so be careful and gently pull down the sides do just open it fast and excited ..... lol
3,"the good, the bad and the ugly","Like others I believe the storage case itself is a good quality. However the quality of the thread leaves much to be desired and I wouldn't use it with quilt shop quality fabric.Actually all the enclosed items are fair to poor in quality...I gave the ""insides"" to my grandsons who are beginning sewers but I use the case itself.I've solved the falling out thread issue by storing a filled bobbin on top of each spool of thread. This bypasses the cheap plastic bobbin holder insert and keeps the spools of thread in place a bit better.Thats the good and the bad....and for me the ugly is all the florescent thread...but then my grandsons love it and they use it on their machines....Paula"
3,On the cheap side,"OK, but the thread colors are on the rare side: florescent orange and pink, etc. The ""pin cushion"" is a piece of styrofoam. You get the picture."
3,Does great but...,"Make sure to tape loose needles together or else they'll fall out. I had to put them in a small plastic bag so they wouldn't fall through the cracks. Other than that, this product organizes materials well and comes with good quality items."
3,not suitable for the younger end,"This book is advertised as being suitable for ages 9 to 12. Well, after getting it for my young daughter, it really looks to be more suitable for the upper end of that spectrum. The book is nicely laid out with an interspersing of jokes and exercises, but so far the actual riddles that you've got a chance at figuring out are pretty few and far between. Most of the riddles are ones that you really can't figure out.Anyway, I'm more impressed with the other ""everything kids"" books I've purchased."
2,disappointed,I wanted riddles and brain teasers. This book had puzzles and games that I wasn't interested in. It didn't srve my purpose but would be ok if you wanted puzzles and games.
3,good for younger children,"This book is a good book for young kids. The riddles, puzzles and actiivities are definitely geared for elementary children probably in the K-3 level. It was not exactly what I was looking for."
4,Log Home Interiors,"This is a beautiful book with a lot of excellent glossy photography, but on the whole I wasn't happy with the execution. The authors chose log homes that are just not what log homes should be; simple, rustic, and cozy. These homes are large, expensive, and over-decorated. If you like baroque decors fine, but I think most people would agree with me that these rooms are too ornate. In addition, the photography while glossy, sharp and color saturated, is too harsh and contrasty. If you like the log theme and at the same time favor really ornate decors, this book will suit you, otherwise...."
2,Disappointing,"The interiors are not the quality I had hoped for.And an entire book of log home interiors became too much for my eye in the end. I have bought several second home books recently, and my favorite remains a new book called Second Home, which shows not only log and timberframe homes but airy beach cottages, cabins in the woods, lake homes, and every other style one can imagine."
1,Don't bother.,"I read Nadfine's Crenshaw""s Eden's Embrace and really enjoyed it. I found it well-written and the characters were strong and not ""cheesy"". I wanted to read another one-unfortunately, this one doesn't measure up at all."
3,Felt like an....,"While the ""tone"" of the book was written for us non-astronomers in mind, I could've used more illustrations--even pencil drawing ones--for many of the concepts such as angular size.Being a visual person, I probably should have looked at it first before ordering it. Someone who isn't as visual will probably do well with this book, as it's filled with a lot of excellent information throughout.1-24-02 update: After posting my review on this book, Professor Chris DePree e-mailed me and apologized for my problems with his book, explained why there were so few illustrations (budget constraint), and asked for any more comments so they could improve the 2nd edition. Wow, was I impressed!"
1,Didn't enjoy this,"I don't usually write reviews, but I think buyers should be aware that this recording has little to do with Lamott's very good book, 'Bird by Bird'. These tapes are self-help tapes, like Julia Cameron's stuff. I was disappointed and a little bit annoyed. The box even says 'Writer's Audio Shop' on the front--very misleading. I say read the bird book and pass on these supposed 'word' lectures. Sorry Anne."
1,"2% writing advice, 98% self absorption and psycho-babble","2% writing advice, 98% self absorption and psycho-babble. If your primary interest is self help for the compulsive, addicted etc. - this is the book for you; if you are looking for writing advice try John Gardner."
2,NOT the same WOOD BROTHERS!!!,"This CD may be what you're looking for if you like twangy COUNTRY music...BUT, if you're looking for the FOLK band ""The Wood Brothers"" (Albums: ""Loaded"" and ""Ways Not To Lose""), you're in the wrong place.I bought this CD thinking it was a different band, and was disappointed."
2,Definitely scratchy,"I plan on washing the heck out of these before I use them,just to make them softer,I received two gingham check prints and they are cute to look at."
1,Paper-thin and do not wash well,"I almost feel like I did not receive the same sheet as the people who have reviewed this product. These are extremely thin and rather scratchy. Thinking a wash with fabric softener will do them good, I threw them into the machine. They came out a wrinkled and even scratchier mess. I have never seen sheets behave this way in all my life - they folded in on themselves like origami with tiny tiny very hard wrinkles. Of course I cannot return them now that I've washed them. I would not purchase anything made by this company. In fact, I think I will stay away from bed linens on amazon all together."
4,nice,"We bought the yellow gingham sheets, the red gingham dust ruffle and the red gingham curtains. All are good quality. My sheet 2 pack came with two yellow gingham sheets, unlike reviewers of the blue that included one white sheet. The sheets are soft and attractive. They fit VERY snugly over the mattress protector and I worry just a bit that an older baby will have them pulling off at the corners. Overall, they are nice enough, reasonably priced and cute in the hard to find ginghams."
4,Stanley Black and Robert Farnon,"Black and Farnon stand out among 50s arrangers and conductors of popular music of that day. Here with excellent sound and performances of the easily accessible music of Gershwin and Grofe, it is a pleasure to enjoy them all once again. Highly recommended."
3,DDR Deluxe Pad,"First off... this is agreat pad, quick accurate response but it is NOT FOR XBOX 360. So given that games are not forward or backwards compatible... it is for the old XBOX. So it is pricey and is obsolete for the new games... HMMM does anyone make an adpater for this plug and converting to USB for the 360?"
3,"Pad works fine, but slips around quite a bit","The sensitivity on this pad is fine, but you may want to put a no-skid rug backing, or yoga mat down as it travels on carpet."
4,foam pad is worth the extra money,"I bought one of each, a foam pad and a non-foam pad. The foam pad is better; it allows you to play for longer in your socks; your feet don't start to hurt."
2,No Good,Sorry for the mistake my wife she just began playing she took the time to write the review but I began playing today and I played several years ago at heavy mode and sometimes non stop mode the pad is no good the bottom arrow does not work properly and the start button doesn't work at all I know how the pad respond and react and not what I was expecting
3,Don't trust the discription,"This is not a bad product. However, when you order a dance pad with a 1"" foam insert and get a cheap version with no insert it is disappointing. I returned mine for refunds because it is not what I ordered."
5,Love these!,I've missed these since the bulk candy store went out of town a few years ago. As good as ever and actually a lot cheaper then when I bought these back then.
4,great snack,"i would give this product 4.5 stars. i like the chewy gummy texture and it has a decent grapefruit taste. It is a little sweet and i would not mind some sourness in there too, but overall it still taste great and is a good snack.amazon shipped this ultra fast i ordered on sunday and it got here on tuesday (earlier than expected times of Wednesday and Thursday) and it came in great shape."
2,"Good product, but not when shipped.","I love Haribo grapefruit slices generally. They've been awesome when purchased at a local store, with a nice grapefruity and sweet/sour taste.However, buyer beware when purchasing online or mail order - when shipped around a lot, it appears that the citric acid granules get shaken off the candy slices, leaving them far less sour than they are supposed to be. My big 5-lb bag has a pile of citric acid in the bottom, and it does not reattach itself to the candy, even if poured over. The end result is a rather bland tasting piece of candy. So if you're a sour gummy lover, only buy these locally!!"
1,5 pounds of melted candy,"I purchased this online since we are no longer able to find this item at Walmart, it tasted GREAT however well more than 1/2 the bag was melted into on LARGE block, I am not sure if this is stored in a warehouse or if it was from traveling UPS in the Florida heat but it was basically a waste of money, we only got to eat about 1/3 of the bag and we discarded the rest :( This is my FAVORITE candy and to throw it away was such a waste."
5,Absolutely Fabulous!,These are the best candies ever! I remember digging through the Haribo mixed fruit bag to fish out all the grapefruit pieces when I was a kid. My mom and I both loved them! I was completely surprised to find them in a bag all their own. It made a wonderful gift to send my mom! She said that they are even better than she remembers! Sweet with a little tartness to them makes the perfect combination! Oh and the bag is huge! ;)
2,not as sour as I'd hoped,"they sent the pink kind, not the white kind. Still tasty, but not what I ordered."
1,Worst CD Player Imaginable,"Okay, when playing MP3s I want to strangle it. It makes weird noises and skips constantly.Playing normal CDs, it doesn't make the weird noises, but skips constantly and cuts off the end of songs. (It has a ""feature"" that cuts off what it considers silence at the end of tracks -- well, it makes CDs that you've listened to normally that have fade outs and such, sound horrible)It doesn't even work anymore; it thinks the player is open and won't play. I tried to fix this so the really tiny button inside would always be pushed down to make it think it's closed, but, I got annoyed with it and gave up.It requires 4 batteries and is huge..needless to say, it eats the batteries up really fast. Actually, it won't even play unless you have really good batteries - it said my batteries were dead and I put them in a battery detector and it said they were all ""Good"" ... of course, the batteries worked with other devices."
2,still waiting,"the order came late, I think due to inclimate weather around the holidays, and was the wrong size. GL sent return info and label but could not replace product with the right color in my size. I ok'ed a different color but I am still waiting for the replacement. Seems slow to me."
3,Product rec'd does not match picture,"Actual product received differs slightly from photo in listing. (See ""customer photo"") Connector ends are not gold, & plugs are different shape. [Product shipped matches photo on Belkin website at [...] - so apparently supplier has used wrong photo for listing.]"
1,Did not receive item from supplier. Still waiting for a refund,Did not receive item from supplier. Still waiting for a refund. Would not buy anything from this company again. All correspondence is done thru e-mailing
1,disappointed,I read 'imported' and it conjured images of quaint music and a melodious performance by an European orchestra. Aaaagh! It sounds cheesy with irritating drum beats and a keyboard.really disappointed.
3,undone,"Not a bad bass for the price BUT.......the wire on both the input plug & volume pot were loose (no sound when I check it out for the little girl I bought it for) if I had not done that the bass would have gone back. Also the inlay on the neck did not have the moon signs, just dots."
1,Too much blue clothing,"Loving Peruvian textiles and having visited many exhibits in museums, I was very disappointed at the extensive use of blue and blue-green in the clothing. The Inkas used only natural dyes including indigo but not mostly the textiles were reds, golds, oranges and browns. I wouldn't use this book with students. An excellent book on Peru's textiles - though not a child's book - is ""Hidden Threads of Peru"" Rowe and Cohen. These are not ancient textiles, but they do show a Peruvian choice of color."
1,WARNING: Very fragile mirror tunnel behind the color wheel....,"This line of projectors seem to have a fundamental design flaw that needs to be addressed in a recall by InFocus. There is a very small mirror tunnel behind the color wheel (looks like a long prism) that often fails as it is very fragile. This tunnel concentrates and channels the light to the DLP chip and if it collapses it can cause a dark (not black) band to appear at the left/right 1/10 portion of the screen. This band gets wider with time.The reason is that the glue connecting the four rectangular mirrors of the mirror tunnel peel from the heat; in my projector, one of the mirrors had slipped and fallen in.Otherwise a fine projector! If only inFocus would replace these defective mirror tunnels!"
4,Good Projector,"I use it in school and it does a great job.It is very bright and lights do not have to be turned off to see it, plus it is very easy to connect to the PC, speaers, or Video projector. I like the fact you do not need a PC to use the unit.I connected my PC and DVD both worked fine.I did have a small problem and tech support was excellent2 disappointing things1. You must use the remote (IR) to turn the lamp offIf you do not use the remote to turn off the projectorthe projector does not go through a cool down mode whichwill affect the life of the lamp.2. DLP is the newest technology but the colors are not as goodand accurate as LCD projectors"
4,Very helpful,This book was good about giving info about all types of engines and the differences between them. I still rate it a 4 and hope you enjoy it
5,Outstanding,"You simply cannot go wrong. This book, at this price, is a veritable font of information. The only thing I'd like to see is an expansion of the detail. Info is given on block and head casting #'s, and valve sizes, but no info on camshafts. What's more, there were more American postwar engines in the period that were every bit as interesting as the V-8s (Corvair, Slant-6, etc.). I'd gladly pay more to see it expanded in it's scope. All in all, great book."
3,Viewsonic Support,"Viewsonic does not offer in home service for this large monitor (like many other manufacturers). If you have a problem you will need to ship it to Viewsonic.I have what I thought was a minor problem which could easily be resolved. The media reader did not work properly. After much going back and forth with Viewsonic their service department determined the media reader portion of the N3200W does not work properly with some standard digital camera files and now states ""the media reader is considered a courtesy picture viewing function of the display"" and as such will not guarantee that it will perform properly. The N3200W product information does not call the reader a courtesy function as I took in good faith it would work, it doesn't work with many jpg files.I have not yet determined if all other functions work properly (I don't use all the inputs/outputs). Are there other ""Courtesy"" functions not supported by Viewsonic?"
2,Limited help and weak examples,The book has good introduction material the examples described in the book are bit old and some of the classes are deprecated. The book also needs an update to include newer features of JCE and JSSE. I hurried up to buy this book and then realized it is bit outdated. Now I have Core security patterns by chris steel which covers well on cryptography api and examples using j2se 5.0 and j2ee 1.4 as well.
5,One of Her Best,"This is one of the best performances of an operatic artist with the Morman Tabernacle choir in existance. Kiri's poise, music selections, and execution are flawless. The ending of ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" which would be forced for other artists is effortless for Kiri.For anyone who enjoys choir music with guest artists, this recording is a ""must buy""."
1,Horrible,"Hello,I thoroughly dislike it when a fellow Amazonian states in their review 'This book was so terrible that I couldn't even finish.' I can now empathize with that feeling.To my credit I plodded through it, so I could review it with a clear conscience. I think I was a few hours of life dear readers. Please take my advice on this:If you dislike hard headed , chauvanistic barbarians with Scottish burrs that call their heroines lassie, then this is NOT the book for you.If you're a tad bit logical in your romance reading , this is NOT the boook for you. (There is time travel which I have NO problem with. Why does it take weeks for the Babarian to realise that is isn't the 1300's and he can't talk to females as if they're 1 part imbecile, other part prostitute?)All in all, a horrid read."
2,Bored to tears,After reading this author's other books I picked this one up at the airport to keep me company during a long flight. Let me just say I never finished the book and was very disappointed. I love Reagan Reilly but this adventure of hers was a bit too much. Don't waste your time.
4,"Light-hearted, uncomplicated mystery","Regan Reilly is finally getting married to her fiance Jack, a NYPD policeman. The wedding is only a week away and disaster strikes. Her dress was being designed by two up and coming designers Alfred and Charisse. Their bridal salon was robbed and most of the dresses were either stolen or destroyed. There is an array of quirky characters throughout this narrative; namely the four women and Regan who are notoriously dubbed the ""April Brides"" by the media. Their unique stories unfold as Regan races against the clock to solve the crime. Though key to the story, Francis and Marco were extremely peculiar. Joyce's kidnapping felt like an extraneous event that was thrown into the narrative as an afterthought. All wedding and romantic problems were solved in time for Regan and Jack's big event. Overall, it was a whimsical weekend read."
2,Needs a fact checker!,"A ridiculous plot, but somewhat fun to read. Ms. Clark needs to know more about gambling, since she has the bad guys shooting craps in Atlantic City, then the Rileys interview the dealer-uh?! I pictured a guy throwing handfuls of dice around.Also at craps, you win or lose-no other player wins money from you. And I suspect going thru Nebraska isn't the shortest way from NYC to Vegas.Now I will be wading thru ""Laced"" Hope it is better."
2,Teen Oriented,Not sure why this series is even that popular. The endings are so predictable. The characters remind me of something in a Leave it to Beaver family. The writing style is very simplistic. I think Nancy Drew was more hard core than this.
4,totally functional and adequate,"Got these to use for packing purposes. They worked fine. Not nearly as nice as the Sea to Summit Mesh Bag, or better yet, the Outdoor Research set of 3 mesh bags, but they were still totally function and for half the price. The bigger stuff sack is pretty big too. I used it to carry dirty shoes and laundry in my backpack and as a laundry bag for carrying clothes to laundry mats. It could hold 10 lbs. of clothes for those trips There's also a handy carrying strap across the bottom which worked really nicely.RE: the smell, they do have that manufactured-plastic smell to them, but it's not a huge deal. Definitely wouldn't have noticed it or commented on it, if it weren't for the histrionics of the previous reviewed."
1,Not sure what to think,They have a strange smell to them they has not gone away. If not for the smell then they would be good little bags.
5,Singer Featherweight 132Q,Very light weight and portable. Sews absolutely great. Ease to use. Very compact. Would highly recommend!
5,LOVE this machine!,"After reading the wonderful reviews on this machine, I bought it. I'm a beginner at sewing, and this machine is so easy to use. I absolutely love everything about it. I was sewing on my grandmother's old machine (which weighed about 50 lb.s, no joke) before I bought this one. This machine is so light and easy to carry. I love how quick and easy it is to thread the machine and the bobbin. I just love it!! Oh, and it's very quiet. I have a 13-month-old, and I sew in the room right next to her bedroom while she's sleeping. She doesn't even stir! I highly recommend this machine. It rocks!"
5,"A cute, yet intelligent little working bunny","This is my first sewing machine after reading on tons of reviews on different makes and brands. I settled with a Singer because my mother has several old ones and it has a reputable name.I was so excited and surprised how easy the manual was and I was sewing straight stitches and even some of the fancy stitches in less than 30 minutes. I love the size of the machine, it's relatively quiet, and it's just a cute little thing!! Bought it on Amazon for $169 about a month ago, surprised to see it now has an even further reduced price of $129. Simply amazing."
1,Stay Away,"I purchased this for my wife to begin her sewing escapade. She used it for a few times and it ended up breaking...unfortunately, when it broke, it was after the warranty was already expired. The repair shop wanted over $100.00 to fix it, so not even worth it. I'd buy something a bit higher up..."
2,wears out fast,We owned one of these for a year. My wife used it for a couple of hours at most - it stopped working. Customer service didn't offer any help.
3,"Not a toy, not for a child","This model is much harder to put together than I thought it would be. It takes days of doing one step, allowing glue to dry and returning to the next step. In addition. bending the balsa to fit the curves of the hull is challenging.I would not recommend this for a child, as it would take a great deal of parental assistance. I am learning a great deal about the boat as I assemble, but it is only for the patient."
3,doris day special review,"This DVD does not play on my computer. Why? I Emailed the mfgr of the disc several days ago and still awaiting a reply, but not holding my breath. The disc plays well on my stand alone DVD players. Maybe it's my computer, I don't know, but all other dvd's have played on it perfectly."
4,A Day to treasure,"For fans of Doris Day, this is a welcome reminder of her huge talent.A much underrated singer, she could do every thing, sing Dance, and was a consummate actress, either in comedy or drama.It good to see her teamed with another sometimes forgotton performer, Perry Como....thay make an attractive couple, and the pity is that Doris did not do more Musical Spectaculars for television. Look out for her only other one ""Doris Day Today""...if you like Doris you'll find both of these dvd's two to treasure, and if you dont know her work you are in for a journey of discovery and rare pleasure.JOHN CRAIG"
5,Awesome!,"I think I made my boyfriend's life when he saw these! Durable, firm fit, can't wait to get out and test the waterproof factor!"
1,NO SMALL HOUSES,I bought this book to get some ideas on creative storage for a smaller home. The homes in this are not what I would consider small.
5,Most Exciting Recording Of Kodaly's Music I've Heard,"Ivan Fischer certainly enhances his reputation as one of the foremost interpreters of Eastern European 19th and 20th Century Classical Music with this exciting set of Kodaly performances, most notably the Hary Janos suite. The Budapest Festival Orchestra gives lively performances replete with Western perfection and Eastern European charm. The children's choruses are equally delightful. The warm, atmospheric sound quality reminds me a lot of classical Philips recordings made in Amsterdam's Concertgebouw concert hall back in the 1970's."
2,"Nav300 works okay, but don't buy it","I've been using this GPS for almost two years. It works well enough, but it appears that bankrupt Delphi will not be supplying map updates. I am a road warrior, and I am already running into problems where the maps are not accurate, or roads are missing. Also, it won't save a destination unless you are on a road, so if you are in a parking lot, down a long driveway, etc, you have to go back to the road to save the location. We purchased a Magellan 1410 for my wife to use, and it has better search features. And it's more compact!Conclusion: skip this GPS, and buy one from a solid company like Garmin or Magellan."
3,Unshaded directions,"I was disappointed to find out that if you are wearing sunglasses, you can't see the screen. While the NAV300 works great, I was also disappointed with the voice commands. They are hard to understand and don't have a TX drawl. I think a cheaper model would be a better buy. I like the Bluetooth, but the MP3, video, pictures, etc. are wasted features. The speed alert is very helpful on major highways and POIs are a great addition to plain roadway signs."
4,Sure they're re-releases,"While these titles are all available on the Treasures disc, this is the perfect dvd to give to your children to watch vs risking damage to the ""collector"" dvd. My kids love the older Mickey cartoons so to invest a few dollars into this disc makes more sense than worrying about the more expensive disc getting ruined. Be glad that Disney is releasing their titles in a more affordable and accessible manner. Plus a lot of people never had the opportunity to buy the canistered dvd because of limited release and higher cost."
4,No mouse works for america.,"Disney sure loves to mess with us american buyers.First they remove sports goofy in soccormania from it's extreme sports american release, and now this.The funny factory dvds was released in most counties before we got them.They got mickey mouse works tv cartoons.We get the same thing we get on the classics collection, and disney treasures.Still, these are great cartoons for anyone who missed the treasures sets."
1,HORRIBLE,GOT THIS VIDEO FOR A GIFT AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION. IT DID NOT WORK AT ALL. HIGHLY DISSAPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!! SHOULD NOT SELL THINGS THAT ARE BROKEN. THAT IS LOW. NOT GOING TO TRUST AMAZON SELLERS!!!!!
5,Excellent,"This cd is an excellent source for worship at home, on the job, in the car on the way to work. The songs truly ushers you in the presence of God."
4,it is good,"Good music but its not something I can rate as 5. I rarely listen to this one. Buy Hillsongs ""Amazing love"" or ""Blessed."""
3,Did Fleming discover the Penicillium antib. effect?,"The true story of the discovery of the antibacterial effect is doscumented in K. Absolon's ""The Antibacterial Effect of the Penicillium Mold. Billroth 1874 * Fleming 1929."" A historical documentation!!!"
3,Ummm...,"I love Nora Roberts and this is a good story - but not one of my favorite ones.The back cover reads: ""She was a success. Hillary Baxter had been only twenty-one when she left rural Kansas to pursue a New York modeling career. When Bret Bardoff, owner and publisher of fashinable Mode Magazine, offered her a prestigious six-month contract, the sky was the limit. There was only one problem. Hillary fell in love with Brett. But he appeared to be interested only in her glamorous image. Could he learn to love the woman whose face had haunted him from the first instant he had seen her photograph?"""
3,Not her best,"I am in the midst of re-reading all of Nora's books while I wait for some new books to come out. I reread this one and I am not sure what to think. It is a little hokey and you can tell it is early Nora Roberts. But I am also of the opinion that Nora doesn't write ""bad"" books, just some are better than others. This is not her best, but it is still a good, easy read. Hillary is a top model, Bret is the owner of a top magazine. After meeting at a photo shoot, he offers her the layout of her dreams. They have a relationship based on misunderstandings. You can't help but hope they would just have a conversation to clear the air. You wont love it like her newer novels, but you'll enjoy it."
1,"Bad, very bad book. Not Roberts' best.","I have just discovered Nora Roberts and am in the process of reading the books available at my local library. I returned this one after reading about 1/4 of it. It's a typical, early 80s romance where the heroine seems like a stupid, silly girl until the big strong man comes in and protects her. The dialogue and the entire plot just did not make sense to me. I am seriously considering staying away from Nora Roberts' mass market romances and staying with the larger, more well-written ones. If I hadn't already read some of her later works I never would have read another of her books. This was not the Nora Roberts' writing I've come to love and appreciate."
1,Not worth reading.,"Nora Roberts is usually one of my favorite authors with fun characters and witty prose. In this book, there was none of that. The hero was annoying, rude and painfully difficult to find like able. The heroine was insipid. By the 2nd chapter I was ready to set the book down and walk away but I kept reading sure it would improve. To my annoyance, the book only became more frustrating. I managed to work my way through the book but found it more of a chore to suffer through than the usual joy to read that I have come to expect from Nora Roberts writing."
2,"Pretty Bad, not up to Roberts' usual standards","While I liked the characters enough and I finished this book, it is not up to Nora Robert's other standards. Mainly because of the dialogue- it is so stilted and unoriginal. The attraction between the two leads lacked dimension as well. It is a light escape however, if that's what you're looking for. I have to say that while reading it I couldn't help but say to myself, ""wow, this is really bad writing!"" ""how did this pass the editors' lowest test"", etc. Just dopey- sorry. The premise had promise but it was goofily executed."
1,UGH,"OK, I love Nora Roberts - most of the time. Her romantic suspense novels usually have a great plot, characters that are human, but likeable, and are an easy read. But this book STUNK! The sappy female lead totally drove me to the psych ward. I couldn't even finish the book because it was obvious what was going to happen. Frankly, if the characters were likeable, I probably would have finished it. But they weren't. So the book is out the door."
5,BLITHE IMAGES,"Thoroughly enjoyable, well paced, interesting, romantic, keeps your interest, in the true vein of a great Nora Roberts love story."
2,Not her best work,"As a huge Nora fan, I was disappointed in this one. Now, we have to keep in mind that this was only her second novel published, but it was so typical Harlequin in the early 80s-- annoyingly overbearing hero, weak barbie-doll heroine who pretends to be strong but crumbles under the hero's pressure. Nora's first book -- Irish Thoroughbred was SO much better. If this is your first Nora read, please keep reading, because this one was not like her at all."
2,"Great poetry, bad formatting","I have loved the poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay for many years. While all the words are there, the e-book version of this book leaves a lot to be desired. The lines in each stanza are linked together into paragraphs; the line breaks of the original have been completely eliminated. It makes for a difficult and disorienting read. While the price (free) is unbeatable, spend a little more and get a properly formatted version."
5,"Excellent, approachable book","This is a delightful collection of Edna St. Vincent Millay's poetry. It begins with her most famous ""My candle burns at both end"" verses (First Fig) and ends with some exquisite sonnets. It's a must as an introduction to one of America's foremost women of literature, or the continuing study thereof. It's short, sweet, approachable memorable, and a good looking book as well. And you can't beat the price. It is amazing to me that such a treasure can be had for free. Enjoy."
3,Does what it is supposed to do....mostly.,"Based on price alone, I would never buy anything like this as what I work on does not require that level of security. However, when a co-worker left one behind when he quit the company, I decided to give it a try.It is very effective in ""blacking out"" the screen from anyone not looking directly at it. The further to the side one views the screen, the more blacked out it becomes. It really is quite effective if you need this kind of thing. It does darken the screen somewhat even when looking straight on. Not so much as to become a problem, but enough to be an annoyance.My only complaint is that it's difficult to clean. Every cleaner I've tried leaves annoying streaks. If anyone has a suggestion as to how to get rid of the streaks, I would very much like to hear it.As I mentioned above, this is a pricey item and probably isn't worth the money unless you really need the security."
4,Funny!,I really liked this movie and it was better than I thought it was going to be! Tim Robbins' character goes crazy when he hears noises espically car alarms. So he becomes a vigilante and takes care of the problem!
4,Noise,"This was a great movie, it arrived in plenty of time, and was in great shape, I would recommend this sell to others."
1,Don't Buy it!,I saw this Cd/Am/Fm Radio on Amazon and liked the compact design of it. So I asked my girlfriend to get it for me as a Christmas present. Well often the Cd stops playing for no reason at all. Even brand new ones with no scratches on it. And the volume control doesn't allow you to turn up the music very loud. I use it at work so forget about listening to anything over any noise. Don't beleive me? Try listening to Fleetwood Macs TUSKs on it. You will see. If you like Coby products don't buy this one. Look for other Cd players they offer.
5,Watchband for Casio Illuminator,"It arrived on time and OK, veru useful the little tool for remove the pins"
1,Awful,"I must have seen a different movie from the other reviewers! I bought this for my parents because my Dad had fond memories of it, and I decided to watch it. Where do I start: wooden acting (Robert Montgomery will NOW put his face in his hands to indicate anguish!), predictable and silly plot, over-acting (Dame Whitty's screaming was like nails on chalkboard). I wasn't aware there was any suspense....I was pretty sure Danny was evil/psycho from, like, the first few frames. I was sort of hoping for plot twist where the smarmy lawyer turns out to be psycho--now THAT would have been exciting!Don't waste your time unless you really have a lot of love for old movies, regardless of quality. For what it's worth, it was a good print of an old black-and-white."
5,Creepy!,"Based on a play by Emlyn Williams, this movie version does not fail to give me goosebumps! Robert Montgomery played against type - his acting is top notch.Just one word of advise - do not watch this at night, alone, during a thunderstorm. Even the cat crawled under the blanket."
1,Sloman's Whine Fest,"This book should have been called, ""On the Road with Larry Sloman."" This has to be the WORST book ever written about Bob Dylan because it has little to do with Dylan, there is very little in the book about Dylan and is ALL about the writer (Sloman) to the degree, at some point in the middle, he starts referring to himself,annoyingly, in the third person. It is about the dislike of his presence by Dylan's people, his difficulty as being a reporter as a wannabe and is self serving. The only redeemable aspect of this book is his coffee shop conversations with Joni Mitchell at the end of the book.If you enjoy page after page after page of incessant whining and childish, pouting by an author then by all means buy it."
2,"Love Dylan, but Not That Much","The whole thing seemed to be too much Dylan exultation for me. The concert was perfect, exactly the way it was supposed to be. Dylan was always so sage-like and untouchable. Get real! This is the story of Ratso following around a concert and he has a little more access than a fan who could follow the revue around. This seems like fiction not like ""historic document"" of a rock and roll tour."
1,NOT A LEXMARK PRODUCT,"This sale was deceptive. It says LEXMARK all over the order but when you receive it is is an American Spirit knockoff!!!! You can get ""compatible"" cartridges a lot cheaper elsewhere."
4,aquamarine necklace,This is a gift that was shipped to my grandaughter. She is pleased and says it is beautiful.
5,"Great quality, fast service...",The book arrived promptly and was in excellent condition as was promised. I am very satisfied.
4,"Its cool, til you get to the horseshoes, oysters, etc.","I agree with all the negative reviews on this page. The rest of the guide is awesome, but the locations of the Horseshoes, and Oysters are off, sometimes way off. I finally had to write down the places where they were so I would not forget. not much thanks to editors, but on the other hand, they made a great guide, sans the location maps."
3,eh,"It was okay, I guess. It wasn't nearly as helpful as I thought it wounld be, but helpful nonetheless. It didnt provide the best pictures and information."
2,They should have modeled it after the Vice City guide...,"In addition to the things others have pointed out -- the inaccuracies in the maps and screenshots -- I find the guide hard to use. For example, the map for all the hidden horseshoes in Las Venturas is about 100 pages away from the screenshots of all the locations. The Vice City guide was a great guide, very high on usability. You'll spend a lot of time flipping back and forth with this one. The typeface is really tiny, and the mission descriptions tend to be very simplistic (at least the VC guide gave you some actual strategy tips; much less so, I think, with this guide).It's big and slick and pretty to leaf through... but that can't justify its cost. You will find less than 50% of what the game has to offer without it, so you're stuck with buying it. Brady should publish a second edition with corrections, or at least publish online corrected versions of the maps and an errata page."
3,Complicated to use!,"This guide is in NO WAY easy to use. No index or table of content, and being as big as it is it's not easy to search through without them. However the content is very good, but you can save yourself some money and just Google 'Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas online strategy guide' and you'll find one with the same info,help,tips,secrets,etc you need to complete the game with 100% progress for free."
3,Who needs a strategy guide?,"Don't waste money on buying this, unless your really stupid and can't complete the game without some-one helping you along the way. and if u do get stuck, just get the cheats, they'll be all over the internet just days after san andreas is released.If you agree with me, i just saved you some money."
5,Comparison of PS2 to XBOX and PC Version,"I have owned both versions of this guide, and I ended up giving away the PS2 Version. It was very inaccurate in some of the locations of items. For a specifice example, the locations of the Photo ops in San Fierro. The locations were not accurate, and not even matched up correctly by number. Even some of the horseshoe locations were completely inaccurate that they were not even the correct location, which annoyed me because I spent a large amount of time searching for something that was not there. I own a PS2, but I use the XBOX & PC version because of its accuracy. There is no real difference, as the guide does not tell you which button needs to be pressed, so the XBOX version still fits.Also, for those who I know are curious, the XBOX version gives more insight on the dating and ""coffee"" aspects, unlike the PS2, which skips over it."
3,WTF Mate,"The majority of this book rocks. Enough info to find what ya need, laid out well. Finding the horseshoes, oysters, and photo ops is completely different. I don't know if ol' Tim Bogenn got into the liqour cabinet that day or what, but those items sometimes weren't where they were supposed to be. And man that was frustrating. Other than that, and a couple of other small problems, I'd buy it if you're an unlocking-obsessed GTA junkie like myself."
5,great,Perfect condition. Fast shipping. Really useful. Nice artwork. Would buy again if I needed too. Brady games is the best strategy guide!
3,this guy was drunk,I do not know what every one elese thought about this guide but my personal opinion was that the author of it was on crack!!! I was searching for all the tags and #80 was labled wrong. Trying to find all of the photo ops was real fun when you look at the first one and it says its over looking the airport but you look on the map and it's not even close to it.......... same kind of idea for the horse shoes a few not in the places they say they are. I thought mabey I was playing a diffrent version but its a North American release. I payed way too much for this book for it not to diliver what I most wanted 100% completion! I wish I could get my money back???
4,Lovely!!!,"This set of CDs is truly wonderful. I am fond of sacred choral music and purchased the CD mostly to obtain the recording of Gregorio Allegri's ""Miserere Mei."" This song alone is worth buying the set. I heard it live by an excellent college choir in my hometown and immediately set out to find the best recording of it. Most buyers recommended this recording over the others. (By the way ""Miserere Mei: by Gregorio is hard to find.) Additionally the other songs are also so relaxing, flowing, and meditative. I will be honest . . .the Tallis Scholars sing well but not as flawlessly as the Cambridge Singers. You will note that not every consanant is hit in unison, but this is not overly disturbing. (Still that is the only reason for giving four stars instead of five.) The sound is still lovely and the songs gorgeous. In Media Vita is another gorgeous song (first on second CD). If you haven't heard it, I'm sure you'll love the flowing melody!"
5,Great choral music CD,"This CD is excellent - a ""must have"" for every collection. Beautiful voices, relaxing music."
5,Ethereal,Magical blending of superb voices in sacred music. Evocative yet peaceful - listened to this driving across the California desert at dawn this summer and was deeply moved.
5,Music of Angels!,"Great and manifold are the divine mysteries of Christ's love, and all the wonder he hath created. The depth of the love of His children is so beautifuly rendered in the music on these cds, (wich I purchased for 1 dollar less at cdconnection :)). It sparks my imagination to think of the beauty of the songs of real angels. If meer mortal men can make harmony so crushingly exquisite, how wonderful is the song of the Sarrafim??!!! I recommend this to everyone. good music for your private time with the Lord."
3,A Woman's Touch,"This is most certainly not a Charmed book. This is a self-help counselling novel about the pros and cons of having children, with aspects of magic, potions and visions thrown in. Debbie Viguie is more of a counsellor in this book than a fictional writer. She plays out the problems of Piper and Leo extremely well, and from the way she describes Paige listening to a music performance, there is no doubt at all that Viguie can write. But what she forgets is that this is Charmed. She should have focused much more on the magic, the final vanquish, the plot and the enemy. The enemy was a no-brainer, the plot as thin as a report on trigonometrical ratios, the magic nearly nonexistent and the final vanquish being a simple potion. Her ideas are good, of course, but what she lacks is the creativity to put those ideas onto paper. I would recommend this book if you're a woman wanting children, but not if you're a true Charmed fan looking for real action."
2,"""Pied Piper"" leads readers to disappointment","Since Piper is my favorite Halliwell sister, I was excited about the arrival of Pied Piper. Charmed fans, however, will not find much to please them here. None of the characters is given anything interesting to do. Piper spends the book whining about staying home and caring for the children that follow her. Darryl exists only to return the kids to their homes. Paige does nothing but go to the symphony and talk about the flutist as if he were a junior high school crush. Phoebe's only function is to be present at the scene of two murders. The plot is entirely predictable, and the one detail that could be called a twist is not a surprise if you notice that the author has reused a name.If just reading about the Charmed ones is enough to make you happy, buy this book- but don't expect it to do justice to the characters."
3,a yawn for sure,PIPER AND LEO START TALKING ABOUT HAVING KIDS. SOON AFTER ALL THESE KIDS START TURNING UP GETTING LITERALLY ATTACHED TO PIPER. SHE FINDS WHERE THEY LIVE AND RETURN THEM BUT THEY KEEP COMING BACK AND MORE KEEP COMINGPAIGE ON THE OTHER HAND FALLS IN LOVE WITH A FLUTISH FROM THE SYPHONY AND JUST CAN'T STOP GOING BACK TO THE SYMPHONY EVERY DAY.DOES THESE 2 HAVE ANY CONNECTION? LIKE THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER SAID THE TITLE GIVES A LOT AWAY BUT THE BOOK IS OK. NOTHING YOU WOULD DIE TO READ AGAIN.
5,pied piper,Piper is my favorite character on the show Charmed. I enjoyed reading about her as a character in a book
5,cool game,This game is a pretty nice game for GBA Video and I love to watch over and over again!!! BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,do more research before buying this book,"i gave this book 2 stars because there is some attempt to provide recipes that are for diabetics... however, there are a lot of recipes that are very high in carb count... for example...the very first recipe on pg 18, corny french toast, is 69 grams of carbs... pg 26, corn potato chowder is 53 carbs... pg 28 pancakes 76 carbs... pg 38 pasta is 68 carbs... anyway, you get the point that this book is loaded with hi carb recipes. i would not recommend this book...you can get just as good recipes by doing a google on the subject... i feel the term ""for people with diabetes"" on the title is very misleading..."
1,A bad joke,"Almost every item in the book will set off your blood suger- All sort of high carb items from crackers to oatmeal, bananas and rice and pasta. This book was a joke and a waste of money."
3,A bit dissapointing,"After hearing Born A lion and We Sweat Blood, i was really looking forward to this album. I loved the balls out approach and simplicity matched with the over the top lyrics. On Sleep is The Enemy, he seems to have toned it down alot and went for more melodic vocals and guiar work. Its okay, but lacks the raw energy of the previous albums. I suspect they are trying to reach a larger fanbase and keep their old fans at the same time, which is why you have hard hitting songs like The Finger, and then more radio friendly ones like Baby Hates Me or First Date. The 3-4 hard hitting ones are great, and the rest is pretty average stuff."
3,maybe they need some sleep...,"I've been a fan of Danko since I got the c.d. Alive and on fire, but it wasn't until they released Born a Lion that I became a hardcore fan. That c.d. has yet to be beaten out by their newer releases. We sweat blood was a notch below Born a Lion and Sleep is the enemy is a notch below We Sweat Blood. When I first heard the single sticky situation on the radio I thought boy this c.d. is gonna rock. Instead the c.d. quickly becomes boring and almost 'poppy'. The first two tracks on the disc are excellent as well as two other tracks on the c.d., Invisible and Time Heals Nothing. But tracks like Don't fall in love, the finger and first date, those are just ridiculous. I don't know if they're losing their harder edge to appeal to a larger fan base or what. If you're just getting into Danko, check out Born a Lion before you wander into his other stuff."
2,Esoteric & Ivory Tower,"I could relate to about 1/10th of the poems. My instinct (late from the moldering glades of the academy) is that these poems were chosen to broaden (not deepen) the moat around the ivory tower -- poetry IS dead in this volume, mostly."
3,Bloom is a bit of a grump.,"Here in Australia, where I've been living for twenty years as a teacher, I'd lost contact with American poetry. I happened on the Poetry Daily web site and dived in. And found, I could order books through Amazon which I'd never seen. I now have two shelves of much read poetry and more in containers on slow ships on their way. I remember the pleasure I got from reading the commentaries and the poems in the Best...of 1997. So when I saw the Best of the Best (Harold Bloom's ed) I picked it up here, even though it was very expensive. While I enjoyed most of the poems, I found his introduction surprising. What a grump!"
2,Should be called the worst of the best,"Face it--Bloom is insulated, not in touch with the real issues and trends facing poetry today. His utter rejection of Adrienne Rich and her volume of 1996--one of the best in the series--only shows to his detriment, not hers, and to the detriment of this volume. While there are memorable moments in Bloom's volume, it falls flat for its lack of relevance to the lives lived by poets and readers alike in this day and age."
5,Fascinating insights from someone who was really there back in the day....,"The ""Tales of Trunfo"" book is a fascinating insight into life in the Triunfo/Westlake Village/Oak Park area of Southern California.Bordering Los Angeles/Ventura Counties, this is a first-person recollection of life on the Russell Ranch, back in the early to mid 1900's and was a fascinating read.This book has become one of my prized book collection items, as it's hard to find/out-of-print and limited quantity.The fulfillment of the book order was prompt and the packaging was almost archival, but much appreciated as the book is getting up there in years and deserves special treatment.I was so intrigued by this book that I searched out ""Cattle on the Conejo"" by the author's relative, to get HIS perspectives as well...."
2,misleading,"this is not a bbc concert, it is actually mostly taken from the groundhog night cd from '93. nowhere on the packaging does it say it is a bbc concert, only on amazon's write-up. like the cd eccentric man live at the marquee, this is actually some tracks from groundhog night and a few others thrown in. i was very mislead and unhappy. the sound quality is fine, but i would say spend a few more bucks and just buy groundhog night since all you are getting here is bits and pieces of it and a few other throw ins."
2,Still on the Lookout,"I am still on the lookout for a natural non-comedogenic soap for my body because I have shoulder and back acne. It did get my squeaky clean, but I definitely needed a good moisturizer afterwards as my body was excessively dry."
5,Excellent facial soap,"This is a great, natural daily facial soap. I've used soaps, scrubs, and all the acne cleansers and this product works great. Highly recommend!"
5,Music of true and lasting appeal,"This is a composer destined for future stardom and a true place amongst the greats of Czech music. He was a scholar of the Latin language and wrote and set many of his own texts. He was also a musician of true quality and originality. Strongly influenced by his native region and also Bohuslav Martinu, he developed his own musical voice, writing works that possess a heavenly naturalness and appeal. Any music by Jan Novak is worth hearing and the performances on this and its companion CD are worth every penny."
4,Nice Little Machine,"I've never owned a serger before, so I can't compare this machine to anything else. I've always wanted one, but they look so scary...especially threading it! I was just tired of straight stitching and then zig zagging my seams. Plus, no knits on my regular machine.At first I just couldn't get a decent, balanced stitch. But with time and patience (I'd say about two hours), I got there. This machine works fine for my personal use and I thinks it's a nice little machine for the price. It saves me tons of time. Practice, practice, practice on fabric scraps and watch the DVD that comes with it. It's very helpful. The manual is so-so. I'm glad I bought it. Also, I've looked on the web and there are several sites that carry parts for this machine. I'm asking my husband to get me some of the optional feet for my birthday."
2,Not worth the money!,"My first serger I purchased back in the mid 80's was a Singer. I had it for over 20+ years and never had any trouble with it. I took it in for some routine maintenance and I got it back with the tensions all messed up. I ended up just buying a new Singer model 14SH654 at Walmart. From the get-go, the motor smells hot when I use it. The needles they tell you to use I can only find through the internet on Singer's website. It's very time-consuming to thread. The manual is definitely not user-friendly. Whoever wrote it must have been an engineer or rocket scientist! I am extremely disappointed with the performance of this machine. I will never buy another Singer product!"
4,A decent machine - gets the job done,"Having never used or purchased a serger before, I bought this one on clearance and set it up. It was tricky to get started, but once I found out what my errors were I was on my way. You must set the threads deep enough into the tension discs. I've sewn baby items and they've turned out nicely. I'm pleased overall with my purchase. Now I just have to practice!"
1,Don't waste your time and money,"I purchased this machine thinking it would live up to the Singer Name, (even purchased a gathering foot, which by the way no attachements come with this machine,) boy was I wrong, the first time I used a different setting on the tension for gathering it never worked right again, no matter how it was set. I contacted support and they told me that it could be due to using different brands of thread, or setting the tension differently, anyway I got the run around. I have been a professional seamstress for over 30 years and know how to set tension and know about quality thread. They also told me to get it corrected I would have to send it to a repair shop, keep in mind that this machine was less than three weeks old! It worked a total of about one week. So I boxed it up and returned it to Wal-Mart and ordered a EZ Lock and it is working beautifully! and guess what, you can use different brands of thread."
1,you might want to consider another machine,"i ordered this exact serger through ebay, the bulb was busted and it didnt sew very well no matter how much i tried to work with the tensions. the seller was great and sent me a new one right away, the exact model. the serging is ok right out of the box, but if you change the threads and have to adjust the tension, forget it. the serging is terrible. i think the tensions in these machines are not very good quality, honestly, i dont know what its problem is. it's become very frustrating working on it for hours, reading and rereading the instruction manuel, and threading and rethreading. well, i'm on my way to the sewing repair shop!"
1,Broken in 20 Minutes!,I have been sewing on a 20 year old Brother serger that broke in the middle a project. I ran to Walmart and bought this Singer off the shelf out of desperation. At first I was impressed because it was really easy to thread - way quicker than my old Brother. The stitch looked nice but I was immediately concerned about the squeaky noises all the moving parts were making. It sounded very cheap. Then after about 20 minutes of sewing I heard a loud CLUNK and see that my right needle thread has broken. I try re-threading and it breaks again...I look inside to investigate and see the needles are scraping against the lower looper arm - which means that it had somehow gotten bent in the few minutes I had been using it. I looked at the loopers and the metal looked so thin I think I could have bent it with my finger. I will be taking this back to Walmart tomorrow for a refund. I am going to buy the Brother 1034D - it is comparable in price and has way better reviews.
1,THe worst Serger - ever!,"Bought this Singer Serger NEW, from the Viking/USEW center in Joann's January 2008. I have 30 Years sewing experience and am a ASG member.This machine has been horrendous. I gave it a try, thought it was a good price, it was on sale, and with the present economy was hoping it would be a good buy. Save Your MONEY and BUY A Better BRAND! You are going to want to pay the few extra dollars and go with something better. After numerous trips to MANY Joanne stores, this has been used once!For a first timer you will be so frustrated , it will turn you off Sergers!I am trading it in for a Huskavarna or Babylok"
3,Singer Serger,"I bought this Singer serger as a back up machine,it is good for what it can do, but you get what you pay for. I would recommend going up to the next model."
2,I would not buy this machine if I had it to do over,"Two stars because it does serge all right.BUT... it's a bizarre model that I can't find needles for. I've been to my local Singer dealer, manual in hand, to try to get him to order needles for it. Been on the phone to Singer's 1-800 number a half dozen times getting part numbers and numbers of service centers from New York to Michigan. One service center said ""we don't sell that machine. why would we stock parts for it.""In fairness, after enough calls the 1-800 number said they'd send me a ""sample pack"" of two needles... which hardly gives me a lot of confidence as to what I'll do some months down the line.And the New York place said they'd look into it and phone me back in a few days.But folks, my time is too valuable to spend chasing around like this.So... I'd recommend sticking with another brand, unless making frustrating phone calls is one of your particular hobbies...."
4,kay -experienced sewer,"bought this machine from Wallmart when my old serger broke in the middle of sewing a project. Did not read any reviews until after I had sewn on it. I found it excellent, and much less in price than I had expected to pay. I bought my first serger in the 70's a Juki and it was a devil to thread - traded it in . for a MyLock in about 85 - neither of them had differential feed . I like this one lot and think it is a good value ."
2,FRUSTRATED!!!!!,"I have to admit right off that I am not an experienced serger, but I do have good sewing experience. This machine has been such a nightmare for me!!!! I was so excited to get my first serger, but I am having nothing but problems and have not been able to finish one single thing. ARG! It threaded pretty easily with clear color-coded instructions but nothing else has worked. Three needles have broken, one bent (I'm only sewing flannel here!). Now I am out of needles and as others have mentioned, they aren't easy to find. I will have to order new neddles online which is fine with me at the moment as I could use the week long break from this frustating machine! I'll give it one more go when the new needles arrive, and perhaps a trip to the 'local' singer dealer 35 miles miles away, but I may be returning this machiine."
5,Sony cell phone battery purchase,"Great place to order from, had my cell phone battery within a few days of ordering (with regular shipping!) Plan on ordering from them again and again. Thanks"
3,Humanoids has a point,"Creation of the Humanoids is one of the worst directed smart films in history -- Even bad movie director Ed Wood could not be this bad. Yet, for all the incompetence (including much ""off camera mic"" sound work), the story is a smart and thoughtful one. It has been mentioned that Blade Runner is style over content (with a big budget) and Creation of the Humanoids is content without the competence to pull it off. Worth a look (and, more to the point, listen) to the very intelligent ideas presented, but you will not believe how badly it is executed. As for the second feature, War Between the Planets, you will likely want to give it a miss."
1,Beware of the HOT light bulbs.,"We bought this one in blue from our local Lowes. It's adorable, but the light bulbs get EXTREMELY hot. In fact they are hot enough to heat my son's 12x14 room several degrees every time it's on. Since it get over a 100 here in SoCal in the summer this is entirely unacceptable. We had to replace the fan within a year because of the heat problem. Also, you can burn your hand if you touch the glass surrounding the bulbs within a few minutes of the light part being turned on."
5,Bell goes Heifetz!!!,"Don't get me wrong, this was, as always, a Josh Bell CD worth listening to. It's one of his older CD's, and the pieces are played on his 1726 Stradivarius, so his string tone sounds a little more innocent than it does today. But what struck me was his showman attitude, how he really made it clear that he was the soloist and the attention should be focused on HIM. I have never heard Heifetz play Symphonie Espagnole but if I did I'm sure it would have sounded very similar to Bell's, especially during the fifth movement of SE. I believe that this is the last concerto CD he made before he got his '32 Strad and refined his sense of musicality, so it should be of special interest to big Bell fans."
1,TOTALLY MISREPRESENTED,"i bought this book for my uncle's 77th birthday since his time as a b-47 crewman was one of the highlights of his life. $150 for a book is a lot, but i knew he would cherish it and i didn't want to give him a used copy. as it turns out, that's what i got for my money. there was obvious wear on the book, and even scratches on the cover and jacket. because i received the book just before his birthday, i decided to go ahead and give it to him. i won't be buying anything from that vendor again."
5,Book worthy of the price,"Good read and worthy of the price. Takes a bit long to get to you as it is a print on demand book. I would recommend that you ask for the 5x8 copy and settle in for a good read. MSN, my employer, has picked this book up for review and it looks like a great project."
5,With a Little Faith Review by Gil-Ann in North Carolina,With a Litte Faith was an excellent book. I just finished it last night. It does the heart good to know there are folks out there like Jude and her children. I am so glad they took Faith under their wings and never gave up on her. She is truly a miracle dog and God sent her to the Stringfellows to help them heal. God also sent Faith to help others. The book was real - Jude tells it like it is. She is my kind of gal. Great book and I would refer it to anyone!
1,How did this book ever get published?,"I just finished reading the 2nd edition in it's entirety. I finished it only because I'm laid up right now and I had a morbid curiousity to see this train wreck to the end. Not only was this book NOT about Faith the dog, it was the most poorly written book I've ever read! There were spelling, grammatical, and word usage errors on almost every page. It was actually a comedy of errors! The run-on sentences alone rquired re-reading just to derive some meaning. To top it all off, the author repeatedly refers to herself as an English Professor in her self-absorbed, tangential diatribe about her personal messed up life. Do yourself a favor; read what others have written about the truly amazing dog-Faith."
1,Duped by Title,"I expected the book to be light hearted, upbeat, and uplifting. Wow, was I mistaken. I have to agree with the person who said that this content is better served in a journal. I made it through half of the book but ended up skimming through quite a few chapters because reading over and over about the abusive ex-husband and his new wife is just too much. I truly feel for Jude and congratulate her on her perseverance, but wow, I just felt like this was very personal information that should have been kept between Jude and her therapist. I'm thinking now that I should have asked for 'Faith Alone: Stories of an Amazing Dog' as my birthday present because what little time I am able to carve out of my day for reading may have been better served reading that book or cracking open one of the classics."
5,"Amazing, absolutely amazing","I saw the show Montel where Judy and Faith were on. Me being an animal lover and one that rescues all animals that are hurt or disabled. I fell in love with the story and then decided to go out to get the book. I ordered the book and through tissues and some nice music I read the book. It is overwhelming and touching from the tragic to the positive accoplishments done for such a dog. Any other person would have put the dog to sleep, but instead one person took a dog and gave it a chance at life. All I can say is congrats to you and god bless you in all you have done and all you have gone through."
5,Aweeeeeessooommmme,"Whoever this Johnny Benson is, I bet he's an idiot, or maybe the ex husband of the author and just doesn't like the fact that he's being told on in the book. There is no way this is a garage sale freebee book. The author is from my hometown and she's doing signings in many states at the request of many of us! Go Jude! Ignore the idiot! Awesome 5 star book!"
2,The book is not about the dog,"I was disappointed when I started reading the book and so far, have not finished it. I really wanted to know about Faith, not her owner's life. I guess I should have read the reviews better because they do state that the book isn't much about the dog."
1,With a Little Faith,"I have to agree with all the naysayers. I too am disappointed in this book. I was looking forward to reading about the dog, Faith and I'm over one-half finished reading the book and Faith has yet to be mentioned. Way too much about the author's family troubles. Maybe I'll skip ahead to where Faith is mentioned and start reading from that point."
3,Not to nitpick but...,"If the book is published by Xlibris that is a self-publishing firm. You are responsible for your own copy editing. You are responsible for picking the font and correcting spelling and grammar. Just seems a little strange to blame the publisher for these errors. I haven't read the book, by the way. I considered it but I found some of the author's statements to be a little difficult to understand given her use of a self-publishing company."
3,Thought It Would Be More About the Dog,"I purchased this book at the urging of my husband who had seen a piece on the dog. We love animals and wanted to know more about this special little dog. While the book was interesting, I expected it would be more about the dog - how they trained it, challenges in working with an animal with special needs, etc. Instead, it is more about the trials and tribulations of the author. And yes, she has had some tough times - but hey, don't we all? There's nothing about the dog until more than halfway through the book. If you want a book about how a single mom overcame hard challenges, then it's a good story. If you want a book about a dog - then this isn't it."
5,Couldn't stop reading,"This is one of those books. It hooks you, and you get reeled in. Prepare yourself, you'll cry. I saw the dog on Montel and had to get the book. I'm glad I did."
1,Big Disappointment,"This was the most disappointing purchase I have made in a long time. The first disappointment was that 149 pages are all about the author's dysfunctional marriage and her bitter divorce. Like there aren't enough of those stories available! I bought this book thinking it would light, uplifting, charming and hart-warming. I expected to read about how the two-legged dog named ""Faith"" touched the lives of her human rescuers. Instead the author goes on and on about all types of personal problems at home and at work, but very few pages are spent on the charm that I expected.The font is distracting and hard to read. There are typos. This book is not a good buy."
3,With a Little Faith,"I expected to read more about raising the dog and working to overcome the challenges that he was faced with. That is the reason I bought this book. I am an animal lover and send praises to everyone that give animals care and love.I didn`t want to read about the abusive personal life of this family. Yes, it was tragic for them and I am sorry about that."
2,Not great,"I've seen Faith on videos and had high hopes for the book. It didn't really meet my expectations. It started out good so I kept reading. When it seemed to be more of the same I kept reading hoping it would get better, it didn't get there. Seemed to be about how the author kept speaking her mind and getting herself into situations. Not about a dog, as I'd hoped and expected. Nor a ""pick me up"" sort of book.Not to be picky, but there were so many grammar errors - to the point of being very distracting - and this from an English teacher.Wouldn't recommend it to others."
4,With a little Faith....anything is possible!,"This is an inspiring story written (mostly) about a dog who was found as a puppy with no front legs. The story tells about how his ""family"" trained him to walk upright on his hind legs all the time and become the only known bi-pedal dog in the world! It is a truly insipiring story of courage, faith, and miracles! I would recommend it to any age...especially if you are an animal lover!"
2,Frustrating,"This book was so frustrating to read. These thoughts are for a personal journal, not a book for publication. Jude goes on television shows to discuss Faith, the dog, and talks about her book so readers assume the book is about the dog. However it is about her personal frustrations over family issues. I feel for her struggles. I admire her strength. However the book was boring, frustrating, annoying, and difficult to read."
1,Faith is remarkable,"but not the book. I tried to give the book a chance butI was not interested in reading about the author's divorce,bad marriage etc. I wanted to read about Faith, Faith, Faith.Title of book misleading."
5,Incredible story and then some,"Haven't been so impressed in a long time. This one is a good one. Tissues please! Forget about being depressed, this book drives it right out of you."
3,book club pick,My bookclub just read the book. Everyone had positive comments about the book. Many are going to have their kids read the book. All are sharing the book with others. Good read.
3,Picture is great Sound is not,The picture quality on this television is amazing but the sound is lacking. I have had to return this set twice because of a buzzing noise emitted from the speakers. Other than that it is a great item at a great price.
5,Early Singles,This album is a true example of the innocence that Céline's native tongue brings out in her. The words are so soft and fluent. Overall a brilliant buy for any dedicated Céline fan who wants to complete their collection.
5,Love it,This is the second book by Natalie Goldberg that I have purchased. Her perspective on writing is unique and simply conveyed.
4,worth reading,"I love reading books on writing and came across this Kindle one. I purchased and read it in a week. I think it's a good book, well worth reading. It has many good writing exercises throughout. I grew tired of a few of the stories by the end (the drug taking, the rant about not needing a degree, etc.). The bit about getting a degree being a waste seemed ridiculous to me, especially since early on she made a point via Hemingway in say that ""...if a writer knows something, even if he doesn't write it, it is present in his work."" So that seems to contradict her rant about not needing and never using her degrees. Overall this is a good book and worth reading."
3,"Interesting read but not really a ""how to write"" book","After reading it twice, I think this book contains both positive and negative aspects. Basically, I've come to the conclusion that it's not a book on how to write. Instead, I view it as a memoir by a person with a more-or-less interesting life. At times, it makes for fascinating reading; other times, the stories and anecdotes fall really flat. The writing advice itself is sparse though there are several decent exercises to cure writers' block. Goldberg is a remarkable writer who has wisdom and wit, but I expected more actual writing *technique* from this book and was therefore disappointed.By the way, I pity the narrow-minded reviewers who bash her for writing about her relationships with women. I've read plenty of books by heterosexual authors who constantly mention their spouses, and I don't see readers accusing them of throwing it in their faces."
4,More of the same...,"This is the follow up volume to the excellent Writing Down the Bones. If you have read the first book, and still feel blocked, then this book could prove very useful. What I feel is that she covered most of the important aspects of being an aspiring writer in 'Bones, so I feel their is some rehash, and some material that is just not as good as 'Bones.Still, she builds more on both zen and jewish wisdom, and it does not do anyone any harm to read it.Of course, this book helped me to appreciate haiku, and that counts for something!"
3,free your mind and your pen,"I recommend this book to help get the creative juices going for writers and writers-to-be. Although the writing in the book itself is sometimes a little bit dorky or awkward, this is more than compensated by the overall rush of good suggestions and liberating writing exercises, all presented in a way that is unpretentious, confident, entertaining, and sound."
1,"Woolly, impractical new age rubbish!","Believe it or not, this offence to trees was touted to me as a textbook for my creative writing course! Woolly new-age thinking coupled with profound-sounding but essentially meaningless pronouncements predominate, along with what must be the worse piece of advice a new writer ever had - Lose Control. Honestly, dear, if we all lost control when we wrote we'd write this superannuated hippy crap as well. Writing is a craft and should be an exercise IN control. Useless as spirituality (not nearly severe enough), useless as gay memoir (but I'm happy she found love. Kudos). Doubly, in fact triply useless as a guide to beginning writing. Avoid at all costs. Advice to other beginning writers - get a better, more useful book on our craft, which limits you in scope to anything not by this whiny new-ager. Wish I could rate this in minus numbers."
4,Natalie Goldberg...,"I like Natalie Goldberg...she's real. If you're trying to talk yourself into becoming a writer, I definitely recommend both Wild Mind and especially Writing Down The Bones. Both books have wonderful ideas and exercises that will tweak your mind. The spiritual aspect is what draws me and she confirms in these books what I've long suspected. That is, when you connect with your own Higher Self, creativity will flow--whether it's writing or anything else, that's the first step to ""getting it."""
2,A Disappointment after Bones,"While some will love this book, I found it terribly disappointing after reading Writing Down the Bones -- which I loved. Perhaps this is because Bones was so wonderful this could not compete. I found the writing in Wild Mind cloying and self-indulgent -- to the point of irritation. There are many more inspiring writing books than this. Don't bother with Wild Mind unless you want if for its great cover art!"
1,Self Absorbed Meanderings and Much Ado About Nothing,"I am an author of five books and 60 peer reviewed journal articles...and also a Zen student. I hate to give this book such a negative review, but there comes a point when churning out yet another ""free writing"" book repackaged...pouring old wine, well not even old wine, maybe stale beer, in a new bottle-- and fluffing it up with sexy Zen tidbits...is resting on one's laurels....rather than saying anything substantively new, just get yourself the classic Peter Elbow book on Free Writing. Obviously Goldberg is banking on the goodwill of her publisher to allow this Wild Meandering book to make it to print."
5,Her book helped me become a more successful author.,"I absolutely love this book. In fact, I owe a lot of my own success and joy to reading it. Natalie's book encouraged me to write a book of my own in my field of specialization as a healer of plants, animals, and people. I highly encourage anybody who is interested in following their dreams to read Wild Mind: Living the Writer's Life. It is a wonderful book filled with magic and it can help you become the writer, artist, or dreamer that you've always felt called to be. Read this book. It can change your life. It certainly has for me!"
3,"Wonderful, but a bit too wild","I have to agree with everyone that this book started out great. There was some good advice here and there; the best thing about the book is that it really motivates you and encourages you, giving you hope. However, sometimes Natalie seemed a bit far fetched and off track. Although this book offers motivation, it doesn't offer technique or suitable advice. A wonderful book to have to read once or twice, but not for eleven dollars..."
3,"Nice, but","This is a great book for first-time writers. I, however, don't fit in that category and didn't find many of the prompts helpful. This book SHOULD NOT be bought if you're looking for a book full of prompts (try ""The Writer's Idea Book"" by Jake Heffron). In ""Wild Mind"" the author tells a lot of stories about her life and how it pertains to writing. A lot of the insights she offers to readers are fairly obvious and the readers have probably come to the same conclusions. I would recommend this book for a beginning writer who wants to start reading prompt books and book on writing. If you already have a few of those books, this one can be skipped.*** I hear ""Writing Down The Bones"" by the same author is a much better buy.***"
1,You can do better than her,"This book gave me great confidence as a writer, because I know I can at least write better than Goldberg! All you can learn about writing from this book is in chapter 1: Don't edit while writing. Use the first word that comes to mind. Show, don't tell. Don't think; let it flow. Don't worry about grammar. Write badly if you need to. Write what's hard and hurts.The other 61 chapters are from the diary of an over-sensitive Zen student in therapy, flying all over the country with numerous friends. I found it annoying and would rather recommend On Writing by Stephen King."
5,THIS BOOK GOT ME PUBLISHED!!!,I used to experience writing blocks. It has NEVER happene again after reading this book. She got me published and I am so grateful I can gt anything published now. I would give it a 6 if I could
1,It's lucrative to write about writing.,"That's the only explanation I can come up with for this book. Goldberg has made a good living off of ""Writing Down The Bones,"" and now goes to the well again to offer advice to aspiring writers. Save yourself some time and read Lamott's ""Bird by Bird,"" a much better book on the process of writing that is filled with humor and insight."
2,"Good, but ....","The first part of this book was really marvelous, then she started on ""True Confessions."" If I had known I wouldn't have bought this book. Sex life and preferences should be kept personal and not published, at least not in a book about writing advice. It was totally out of context and had no value at all! I would have given even less stars, but the beginning really is good."
1,Awful,"Goldberg's publisher did her no favor by letting this garbage slip into print. I'm sure her credibility took a swan dive when ""Wild Mind"" came out. In one of the last chapters of the book, she wrote of speaking to her editor and proclaiming her Zen philosophy of writing: ""It's okay if this book is a failure."" By that measure, this book is supremely ""okay."" By the way, Nat, being straight, white, and male doesn't necessarily make one a ""redneck."" Your intolerance is showing. So much for your philosophy."
1,YOU CAN SKIP THIS ONE AND SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Wild Mind is a rambling assortment of stories told by the author ... many of which have nothing to do with the craft of ""writing."" Ms. Goldberg spends too much time discussing ""how she came out of the closet"" and her new gay lifestyle, and how it has somehow impacted her writing. In the end, the book includes very few useful writing tips or examples. I am completely amazed that it has received anything more than below average reviews. Save your money, this one is not worth it."
5,Changed My Life,"I read this book at a difficult time in my life-just after going through a trumatic divorce(when is divorce not traumatic?). Natalie Goldbergs words cut through my panic and gave me something to hold on to. Other people are lonely, other people feel the pain down into their bones. I fell in love with Natalies writng and with my creative self. I started writing poems and songs, one of which won a songwriting contest and was published. Once in a while, I re-read this book so that I can taste the words and fill my soul with the writers passion."
5,fabulous,"I love Doris Day and she was awesome on her tv show.Many people dont know that her husband at the time, Marty Melcher gave a handshake agreement for Doris to do the tv show.After he died Doris felt obligated to follow through with his obligation.It turned out to be a great time as it put her finacially back on the map and she met so many wonderful and beloved co stars>She is a true legend."
3,Hi Infidelity: 30th,On the 2nd CD some of the music was just instrumentalon a couple of songs. On first CD there was some bonustracks.
5,"Disc 2 is the ""gem"" for this release...","LOVED this album for 30 years now, and the remastering is done as well as any that I have heard. The reason to buy this set (assuming that you already have a copy of Hi Infidelity) is for the second disc. It's not often that you get to hear how an album gets it start. The Crystal demos show it all off. While the sound level doesn't seem to be as high as the regular album, it is really cool to hear the songs as they were being worked out by the band. To all you budding lead guitarists, put the instrumental version of ""Shakin' it Loose"" on, grab your Les Paul and play your own licks along with the boys!There are some new comments about the album by Kevin Cronin and Gary Richrath - I wish Gary could have or would have written more, but it is nice to see that he was invited to have a little input on this product!"
5,THE REAL REO,"Even though this has been re-mastered and re-mastered again, I never tire of this album. not a bad song on the disc. Too bad that the ""HI-Infidelity Line-up"" couldn't do a reunion tour! Kevin, Bruce, Alan, Gary and Neal... I seen them several times from Tuna-to Greatest Hits tour. The magic is shown in the demos."
5,Great Classic Children's Book,I was very happy to find this book. This was a childhood favorite and will continue to be for the next generation in my family. The story is simple enough for any child to follow and entertaining each time we read it.
5,Another great Harry book,"As a former preschool teacher, I remember how much my students loved the Harry books. Now that I have grandchildren, I have made sure they have met Harry and experienced his great adventures. Harry and the Lady Next Door is a story any preschool aged child will love."
5,"Good stuff, happy dog",My dog is 9 and these are an easy way to get her to take her joint help. I prefer to order the 3 pack as it works out to be the cheapest.
3,Tastes like chemicals...,"Yes, I tasted them and no, they are not delicious as described. They taste like chemicals but I guess that's what you should expect from a joint supplement. My Shih tzu and Pekingese eat them but only when I'm at work and they're bored."
1,allegric reaction,"I am sorry this product didn't work for my dog. He loved eating the treats, ( rare for him ) but had a terrible allergic reaction , diarreah and more. He must be sensitive to the concentrated vitamins in the treats. I was surprised I was charged for the return."
4,Joint Treats,"I have been buying these Joint Treats for my dog directly from Entirely Pets for quite a while and they seem to really help my senior dog's arthritis problems. When I recently checked Amazon to see if they carried them and found out they did, I was pleased to see the price was less than what I had been paying and they were still sent from Entirely Pets- same supplier. The only negative might be that the odor to these treats is not very pleasing to me but maybe it is to a dog!"
1,very dry,"Bought the soft chews and the minnie soft chews. The regular soft chews were bad,very dry. the minnie were great"
4,Joint Treat for Dogs,"This product offers a chewy little nugget that my dog just adores. He takes it at three o'clock in the afternoon and promptly at that time he is sitting near the jar waiting for his treat. Fred is fourteen and a half and has very little trouble with his joints. He still takes his walks in the park, has no problem getting up and down and goes up and down the stairs in our two-story house many times each day. I really feel that this treat helps his joints and it obviously is a treat for him each time that he eats one. It's a good product."
4,Good product,"I bought these along with the chewable tablets. I was concerned that the tablets would be a problem to administer so I got these also.The products appear to be helping a couple of mature, full figured ladies.The dogs love the chewable tablets and they are cheaper per dose unit. Therefore when I reorder, I will not order this treats, but only the chewable tablets."
4,'Joint Treats' for more 'Energy',"My little Cav.KingCharles girl and I are quite happy with the Joint Treats; not only does she love the taste, but actually, after being on them for over 8 months, seems to run around the yard more and faster! She's only three but the vet was concerned about her knee joints so I am pleased I found Joint Treats."
5,Arthritis relief,"I have been giving these chews along with Deramax, prescribed by my vet, to relieve arthritis symptoms in my elderly Australian Shepherd. He eagerly looks forward to receiving his ""treats"" morning and evening."
4,So far so good,"The dogs seem to like them a lot, but it's too soon for me to tell if they work. Service, shipping was great."
5,Will get you started,This is the first set of yoga tapes I ever bought and actually use. I've tried Living Yoga for beginners but found them complicated and hard to follow. Yoga Zone's instructors are very knowledgeable and easy to follow. This set gives you 2 20 minute workouts per tape so variety is never a problem. These tapes will give you a great workout if you are new to yoga.
3,YZ Basics,"I would not recommend that beginners buy this as a place to start. It's really just short, separate segments from their TV series. I was expecting a more developed, explanatory format,like their other videos featuring Alan Finger (which are better). Those other videos are a much better place to start! This was a disappointing set."
2,Yoga Snore,"I really disliked these videos. I was surprised to find, after reading the other reviews, that these videos were boring, cheezy, and entirely too easy.First of all, three out of five of my tapes had no sound. While this is no mistake of the yoga zone people, it was still very frustrating.Secondly, I could not get into these videos. The people were way too talkative, and the relaxation and meditation did not work because they chatted throughout the entire time.I definately recommend Rodney Yee or other Gaiam products ahead of Yoga Zone if you really want a good, effective, meaningful yoga workout."
3,Durable Wooden Toy,"This toy doesn't really do much. You take a hammer and hit the balls on one end and they come out the other end. I don't really know why that's suppose to be a cookie factory.My son loves the ball though. We had to take the hammer away from him. A wooden hammer and 21 month old rough tumble boy don't mix. We was afraid he would hit his 2 month old brother in the head with it. He also dropped the wooden main part on his toe so we ended up putting that up. These are his favorite balls though. They are plastic, not wooden but very heavy plastic, not cheap plastic. He did end up hitting his brother in the head with one of them anyway but we let him keep the balls."
4,Simple but great,"My nephew is a little over 1 year and he absolutly loved this toy. It seems like it would be pretty stupid, but for some reason the balls popping out of one end and rolling to the other really captivated them."
5,The exception to the rule.,"Usually, K-Tel's collections are a disappointment since they are almost always re-recorded versions of the original hits. This series, issued on CD and cassette, contained 10 original hits (5 each back-to-back on the cassettes) by Artists related either via musical genre or historically associated with each other and it has long been out of print.This cassette contains the original Disneyland/Vista versions of Annette's 5 Highest charting singles:1. ""Tall Paul"" (#7)2. ""First name Initial"" (#20)3. ""O Dio Mio"" (English Language hit single version - #10)4. ""Train of Love"" (LP version - #36)5. ""Pineapple Princess"" - (Mono single version - #10)The other 5 tracks are by Frankie Avalon and, they too, are the original Chancellor Recordings.This is an inexpensive way to add these oldies to your collection."
4,Philosophy and Magick Don't Mix,"This is a great read if you're into Wilson's work. It's more entertaining than the prequel, ""Ritual In The Dark"", but the philosophy is still a bit weak here. The theme of the book is this bloke (obviously based on Albert Camus) who is trying to acheive metaphysical enlightenment through sexual experience. The ""illusion"" aspect of sexuality is a major themeas is Wilson's hobby horse, the theme of the ""narrowness of human consciousness"". Even so, the major interest of the book lies in the person of Caradoc Cunningham, a practically undisguised replica of the occultist Aleister Crowley. This is the only book that I have ever read which seemed to give a balanced biew of hos personality, neither demonizing him nor elevating him to the status of a god. Anyone interested in sexuality or human greatness should read this book."
3,"The book speaks through sex, thought, and narrative.","Mr. Wilson's book, ""Sex Diary of a Metaphyscian"", is a narrative of himself. The story involves meeting an obese, charming pervert and then subsequently hanging out with him. Sex is the prevalent theme through out the novel. The philosophical standing is sound. His thesis statement of truly having focus during the sexual orgasm is valid and witty. It provokes thought. Wilson shares other related idea, but not in a cohesive fashion. Let this be the book you read if you desire to learn a small amount, and be entertained a moderate amount."
4,excellent,Purchased this product becase we just moved into a new home and did not want to drill holes in the walls. This works perfectly and that it is adjustable is the great. I would recommend these to anyone.
2,Design flaw,"The windows in my apartment have been around a while so they have some 'flex' in them. It isn't all that hard to push the window up and over these wedges. What they should have done is make the plastic rough, instead of smooth, and put a little ""step"" right at the top of the wedge so that once you hit that the window could not just ride up and over.The wedges and the Velcro themselves work fine and stay in place. If you have really solid window frames these could be a good solution. If your frames have some flex in them forget it--the window will ride right up and over the wedge with a good solid push (or pull)."
4,works okay,Bought these for my kids' windows on the 2nd story... they work well enough and get the job done but they were not as sturdy as I thought they would be. Keeping them because they do keep my kids from opening the window to far. The Velcro just doesn't stick as well as I thought it should have.
1,I do not recommend this - product didn't work for me,"I had high hopes for this product, as a way to stop both the bottom and top windows from exceeding a certain opening. It turns out for our windows, the wedge is not tall enough - which means it doesn't stick out enough from the window frame. Therefore the window can be forced past the tallest/thickest part of the wedge and just keep going. If they had made the product just a bit thicker at the height of the wedge, it would have worked. Alas, wasn't going to work for me in this design."
3,Good not Great,"This product is much better than average once you get it right. I had screws missing and the headboard was bad. After finally getting replacements, two follow ups by me, it works well. I am not sure it is worth the price though"
1,"OK product, not outstanding","I rate this product only OK. My expectations and impact in my exercise were higher, I am sure this product can be effective for other people."
2,Not designed for women.,"The product was fine except that it was likely designed with men in mind as it is too big for the average sized woman; 5 ft. 5 in., so I had to send it back."
1,worthless product,I can do sit ups all day - no problem but I can't seem to do one with this contraption. It kills your neck and makes a fairly easy exercise more difficult.
1,expensive - comes with no instructions,This product is WAY overpriced!!!! I called customer service when I went to buy it and I asked why it cost so much...the woman couldn't tell me much. I bought it anyway...thinking it was going to be GREAT and it is ok. It doesn't come with any instructions on how to use it - different exercises. I haven't tried the cheaper ab rollers...so I don't know if they are even worse. It is super heavy. The instructions on how to put it together even had typos....makes me wonder where this was made....I'm very disappointed.
2,disappointed,"Got these too expensive filters to replace a WaterPik filter insert. Didn't fitIf you have a WaterPik, throw it away and get something else. Another company that doesn't support its product. But, these Aquapur filters didn't fit into the cannister. So they went into the trash. They seemed very thin in material and probably wouldn't last too long. Just a guess. Too bad."
4,Water Filters,"I was very pleased with this product, it met my needs for filtering our water in the home."
2,not the best I used get the better model,"The NP version is more expensive for a good reason. This one costs ABOUT HALF. this filter which i use for drinking water and all kitchen water is being filtered with this, it is not odor free like the NP version provided. spend the extra few $'s and your water will be completely taste and odor free."
3,"Pictures misleading, this toy is small","I was so excited to see that this was on sale, especially after seeing the picture of the baby inside the toy under the customer photos. When it arrived, I was very disappointed. The picture is clearly of the larger version of this, and it doesn't tell you that. This is actually quite small. When I ordered, there were no dimensions listed in the description, I'm not sure if they changed it. It's only about a 15 inches tall and wide.Also, the toy isn't really that great. The bead thing is neat, but the sliding puzzles on the sides are pretty pointless as you can only slide them about an inch. The music drum thing is attached to a very short cord, so it's hard to use it on the xylophone. It is relatively durable though, made of nice wood, so it will probably last. But then again, my son barely plays with it, so he wont have a chance to break it anyway."
2,Horrible Quality,"First of all, please realize that the customer pictures of this item are totally off. This thing is a foot cube, so there's no way you could fit any baby outside of a newborn inside of it.That being said, when the cube first showed up, it seemed ok outside of the size, and my 2 1/2yr old son and 9-month old daughter seemed to enjoy it. That is, until my son realized that the wires on top were bent in such a way that there was no way for the Elmo block to move at all. Shoddy at best. We've had this cube for a total of 3 days now, and already at least 4 stickers are off of it, due to not being placed center on the piece they were on, or just low-quality stickers. My children still play with the cube, as currently it provides no real safety hazard, but the price I paid for this cube was entirely too much considering the low quality."
3,Sesame Street Activity Cube,"This is a pretty good value, most of these are much more expensive. I just wish the top latched on somehow, rather than being loose. It's nice that you can flip the top for storage, but since it's loose, you can't really carry it by the handle that's supplied. Other than that, we like it a lot."
1,Very dissapointed,"I have been extremely dissapointed with this toy over the past 6 months. I bought it for my 2 year old son (who loves Sesame Street) last Christmas. First, the box it came in was much too large for the product and little to no packing material was included. It was rolling around in the box during shipment. Since our play area is small, the size didn't bother me, but the stickers began falling off almost immediately. Once my son noticed a few starting to lift off, he began peeling them off and sticking them on furniture. I've had to use a glue stick to salvage some of them. More distressing was that a peice of wood from the xylophone broke off during play that he could have easily swallowed. Also he hasn't played with it much because it is so small and the moveable peices move such a short distance. This product is poorly made for the price, and I am shocked Sesame Street still has their name on it and it is still on the market. If I could send it back at this point, I would do so."
2,disappointed,"This CD includes many favourite carols, sung by an excellent choir, however, I felt that the quality of the recording was poor. I was unable to bring out the lower male vocals, thus the upper voices dominated throughout, which was quite disappointing. The accoustic echo made the lyrics almost impossible to discern."
5,Beautiful Choir Music,"I highly recommend this album. The harmonies are beautiful, and the boys choir performs well. The choir is disciplined and sing as one voice. Much of the music is sung a cappella. The director has good interpretations as to the dynamics. There are a number of carols I have not heard before. My favorites are Gabriel's Message, Mary's Lullaby, Jesus and the Apple Tree, and Wexford Carol."
5,Awesome Christmas Music,"I love my Christmas at Clare CD. I had it in albumn form at one time, unable to play so the return of this music within the 12 days of Christmas was most welcomed! Thanks for getting to me and in great shape. I will probably order more this year in time for Christmas gifts!Sincerely,Mark Raddatz, Lancaster, OH"
1,A contradiction in terms.,"Midge Ure's best recordings were made with the Rich Kids before he joined Ultravox, and Ultravox! made their best recordings with John Foxx before Ure joined them"
4,If I Was: The Very Best of Midge Ure & Ultravox ~ Midge Ure,"If I Was: The Very Best of Midge Ure & Ultravox~ Midge Ure is a good compilation of Midge Ures best tracks. However, it is a bit odd as it is lacking some major tracks like the thin wall, the hymn. Yet this seems to be a more a compilation of all the bands that he has been in (like Ultravox, Visage and others). The cover is fair enough, but he does look a bit haggard and quite old. Still and all this a fair compilation that gets the 4 stars that it deserves."
3,Some classic Ultravox ... some lousy covers,"If you haven't heard Vienna and Fade to Grey, then you haven't really heard Ultravox, which was one of the better British electropop bands. On the other hand, this isn't the album to buy, since the Midge Ure covers of No Regrets and Bowie's Man Who Sold the World are terrible."
5,Groundbreaking!,This is the book that Preaching Magazine has declared 2003 Book Of The Year. Amazing - well written and essential for all those who are in the ministry and especially for all preachers everywhere. Excellent.
3,Medical Technology,"In the book Medical Technology, a person can find when the very first successful surgery took place witch is covered in the first chapter all the way to medical imaging to the last chapter. Through out the book one will find the history of medical discoveries to just recent discoveries found in the twentieth century.Each chapter talks about one specific way medicine was changed because of the experimentation and invention of a man, or men, whose work is chronicled here. The narrative reads smoothly and is not so technical as to deter average readers. Chapters end with a chronology tracing the breakthrough from the first small steps to its acceptance into general usage. There are also chapter-by-chapter lists for further reading, Web site addresses, and source notes. Black-and-white photos add interest and diagrams help to clarify some of the more technical explanations."
3,"The Best Of Their Era, But That Sound Quality....","First off, I am a fan of The Pilgrims. Until I heard them, I thought Jon and the Nightriders carried the flame of purity for surf music. After I heard them, I realized that they alone were the keepers of the flame.This is a fantastic bargain, and as such I recommend it. Unfortunately, the sound quality of my copy is not very good at all - it sounds in some cases like either vinyl was transferred or source tapes copied without Dolby. A lot of hiss, and that was why we went to CD's in the first place.Otherwise, this is a magnificent close-but-no-cigar effort. If the sound were better, there wouldn't be enough stars to rate it."
4,Satan's Pilgrams are Neat-o Torpedo.,Great CD for listeners that long for that California surf sound of the 60's. My 1st impression is that these guys must have loved Dick Dale. To bad they are no longer playing together. I would have liked to check them out. I'm not one of those listeners that is going to break down & critique this cd song by song. I'm just gonna say that this is a perfect cd for us open top Jeep drivers to listen to while cruising down the street or for anyone kickin' back in your back yard chilln' with some friend with some tasty BBQ & ice cold beer.
2,Redundant,"There is nothing much helpful here. The Reader's Digest Reverse Dictionary has been around much longer, and provides better definitions. This has a few more modern words, but most of them are either too obscure, or too well known on the other hand, to be useful in writing."
2,Not That Helpful,"I've had this book for over a year, and it has been helpful one time. It never has what I'm looking for."
4,A Must-Have for all writers,Exactly what I was looking for. When I write the Flip Dictionary is within reach...The only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 is that it came in a paper envelope that was ripped and damaged the book...Next time send it in a box or a bubble wrapped envelope.
5,Good cheap holster,I work at s gun range and this holster by Fobus is both light and quick on the draw. A winner for those who open carry daily.
1,do not waste your money,"This was such a disappointment! They gloss over a few good places but never show the natural beauty of the area. The segment that shows them snorkling is only about 10 seconds and is not in a pretty place at all. There is lots of cheesy singing and banter among the ""guides"" and plenty of footage of them at the helm of their boat. I wish I had known how bad it would be and had saved my money!"
2,This Dvd is so disappointing,"Anyone who knows or have seen other dvds from Shekinah Glory knows that this one was very different. It seems like they were trying to put all types of things on the dvd just for the dvd sake. The artist was good but...it took away from there more established dance ministry, which I think are the best Ive ever seen. Also I love love love when the minstrels play and like I said before I love the dancing but the solo was awkward to watch with the dancer. I would have just focused on the minstrel or one or the other maybe. It was edited terrible and some parts were pictures and not even a video. This dvd had much more prophetic words which I love but wasnt shown on the dvd. The dvd just jumps from one part to another not at all smoothly like past dvds. Their past dvds made you want to be there but not this one."
4,Not a bad Receiver,"This receiver is pretty good for the price. I also own the sa-dx940 and sa-dx1040 They are all great and I have never had a problem out of any of them. The 940 and 1040 were known for producing alot of heat, but that seems to have been fixed in the 950. The sound is pretty good. You must however pay close attention to the specs. The 100x5 wattage rating is @ 6 ohms not 8 ohms. This means that you actually only probably get about 80x5 when running 8 ohm speakers. Never the less, sound quality is good. The remote control could be better designed, but serves it's purpose. Overall, it's worth the money."
5,Diference Between SA-DX950 & SA-DX1050,"I've heard SA-DX950 and SA-DX1050 with four SONY SS-MF600H 8 ohms speakears.... there is no diference .... They say that SA-DX1050 has less harmonic distorsion.....NOT TRUE !!!!...... The same sound and the same distorsion..... Both A/V receivers start to get distorsion at -16db with bass +10 and treble +10... The sound is exactly the same.... Both have the same power of the bass ..... I don't know why it says that SA-DX1050 has 20hz- 40khz ... I think it's the same for the both of them 40hz - 40Khz... Now i have SA-DX1050, i payed more money for the S-VIDEO input or output ....not for the power, 'cause it's the same...... So if don't need the S-VIDEO input or output .... Don't buy the SA-DX1050 .... get SA-DX950 for less money.... so you can save some money...."
1,nycdistrict,"really? no more than a lame, boring attempt at a made for TV movie script, and bad even on that level- I like TV, so please let this book kill itself like Lucretia #1"
2,Too much work,"I found this book frustrating. As someone who reads for pleasure during stolen moments in a busy life I found myself working too hard to get to the next page in this book.When I first saw this book on the shelf, I thought it would be a quick 2 day read as most of the historical fiction pieces are that I pick up. Boy was I wrong - it took me over a week, during soccer practices and hours of hiding from my husband.Almost every page spouts some sort of Roman mythical reference. Mix that with stanzas and remarks in Latin and Greek - oh what an investment of time this ended up to be - only to be greatly disappointed with the ending.Mr. Fance may be a brilliant playwrite, I believe he has a lot to learn about the average American woman (I'm assuming was his intended audiance) - with four children and a full time job I don't ever want to labor over a book like this again."
1,Is There A Copyeditor In The House?,"Please don't let this author write again without one!The book is riddled with spelling and grammar errors (even my seventh-grade daughter knows that you don't seize a horse's ""reigns""), but it's the anachronisms that really set my teeth on edge. I'm not an expert in 14th-century language, but I'm willing to bet that the words ""spiffy"" and ""sappy"" weren't in common use at that time. And how Lucrezia could refer to someone's utterance as a ""malapropism"" when the literary character on whose name the term is based didn't exist until the 1800s is beyond me.What ultimately made this book unreadable for me, though, was the tortured prose. An example: ""...these notions became an obsessive sequence of water buckets that I was throwing on my passion's wildfire."" This isn't even necessarily the worst example-just the one that occurs on the page where I finally had to give up trying to wade through the book."
1,a Novel with Multiple Personalities,"Unfortunately, the writer cannot determine if this book was to be a farce, historical fiction, porno, or theater material. It fails miserably to be a good historical novel. Characters are all drawn the same, same dialogue from each. Smut for smut's sake. Very disappointing in so many aspects."
1,Do Not Read This Book,"This book is an utter distortion of political and social realities of the late 15th century Italian States. It is poorly written and disappointingly researched. Case in point, Mr. Faunce has in improbable `honeymoon' sex scene between Lucrezia Borgia and her second husband Alfonso of Aragon, situated in the Villa Adriana at Tivoli. Unfortunately for Mr. Faunce, the Villa was sacked by the Barbarians of Totila in late antiquity and the excavation was not begun until 1501, several years after the wedding. The other instances of sheer mendacity are too numerous to list. The book is rife with other asinine inaccuracies that cannot be excused by literary license. It was supposed to be a work of historical fiction, not semi-historical fantasy. There were absolutely no redeeming features to this work."
2,tiresome,"I'm about half of the way through this and, although I find it historically interesting, it in no way takes me in. A pseudo-autobiographical novel about her life yet the phrases that are used throughout are certainly not phrases that one would expect from a 15th century woman. The language is today's language. This takes something away from the story but it doesn't kill it. I'll struggle through to the end because I can't put a book down if I don't finish it."
3,Just okay...,"SPOILERIn my opinion, Andreas was a complete butthole. I understand being an alpha, but he was just a spoiled little brat who threw a temper tantrum everytime something didn't go his way. The way he treated the Hope was just unacceptable. I liked Hope for the most part, but everything went downhill when I saw how long it was going to take her to figure out she was pregnant. Can you be any more retarded? If you know that you have had unprotected sex and then you start feeling nauseous and tired and have cravings, that in itself should lead you to at least consider getting a pregnancy test. I have no tolerance for studpid heroines, and Hope was near the top of the list."
1,"Agree with 2-star reviewer, and here's my 2 cents:","The hero was just way too overpowering alpha-male; the heroine showed little or no sense in her dealings with him, his family, or in her own life. I give it one star because she did become a LITTLE less of a doormat during the story. But while reading a romance novel, one's primary feelings shouldn't be annoyance and frustration with the characters! This one made the donation book-bin at my library with all speed."
2,depressing,I never thought i would dis a book ritten by Graham as she's one of my favorites but ths book depressed the hell out of me. The other reviews say it all so im just gonna say don't bother with this one.
4,Old Time Hymns,I would like to say that all the Chuckwagon gang tapes are exceptionally good. Especially for the people who like old time Gospel. I lost my cd that had the song on it(God put a rainbow in the cloud) I would be very interested in getting this cd but I cannot remember the name of the album
4,pox is kinda cool.,"i think pox is cool because you get to battle 30 feet away from someone it's not bad,but it's kind of hard.i battle my friends everywhere it's so cool."
1,dont get this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,this toy absolutely stinks!you have to buy batteries like every second!i suggest you get a cybiko instead : ) (itz more money though)
5,POX is absolutely the most...,"POX is absolutely the most intelligent and original toy to come out in quite a while. This is much more than just some overpriced novelty (like Pokemon, or Battlebots), this is a toy ahead of its time. After playing with it for a few weeks I realized that a lot more thought and time went into this than meets the eye. This is a game with imagination that requires quite a bit of thought to strategy, and can be played against any one who may be anywhere close-by.I would like to put forth my recommendation on this item to any who are considering it, and my thanks to the toy makers who created it."
1,amateur claptrap,"I spent 20 bucks for this Mr. Rogers of the waterways? Nothing but a blatant advertisement for weird artwork and doggie life preservers, if you want to see the finger lakes, don't buy this DVD. The cutesy-pie exchange between Captain Mark and his first mate wife will make you barf. Save your money for a bottle of great NY wine instead."
5,Bought it. Read it. LOVED IT! Bought 3 copies for friends!,This book is a must-read! The essays have me laughing out loud and leave me shaking my head in amazement. Kim Ficera is a talented writer and a gifted story-teller. I can't wait for her next book.
3,Not much actual info.,"I didn't get much out of the recording. I was looking for actual instruction, and this wasn't exactly that."
5,Great Russian music in soaring high fidelity.,"Even on my home-office computer system this DVD Audio is truly impressive. Prokofiev, wild and free, and Naxos have teamed up for a great musical experience. Highly recommended."
1,This is garbage!,"At work we still use the old version which sucks bad enough, but this ""upgrade"" and I use that word freely sucks so bad that seeing the price of it nearly makes me vomit. This is terrible software."
5,Not exactly politically correct,"But you know, how will future generations know history if every children's book is cleansed? The negative connotation of gypsy can be explained later. For now, let your kids enjoy this treasure. Besides, the ""gypsy mama"" in this book is portrayed as a kind and loving woman, despite her role as a kidnapper."
1,A disappointment,"My daughter loved the original Madeline, so we were excited to read her other adventures. I found this book quite disappointing. First, the rhymes are awkward and strained, making it difficult to read smoothly. Second, it perpetuates negative stereotypes of the Gypsy people. And finally, I found it quite distasteful that the children were sewn into the hide of a lion."
1,Promotes racist stereotypes,"The content and artwork of this book is as charming as any in the Madeline series, but it is marred by the blatant ethnic stereotyping of gypsies (the Romani people) as unclean, work-shy itinerants. Little enough is known about true Romani culture by most people today. Stereotypes like these only make the situation worse. Yes, the gypsy mother shown is loving. No one in the book is evil. But who would dare recommend a children's book that showed a kindly black mother whose family lifestyle epitomized racist stereotypes of unintelligent and lazy African-Americans? Stereotypes are stereotypes, and they should not be promoted this way in children's books."
5,A Repair Manual for Novices,"Fowler and Haynes have done a fabulous job of photographing and documenting the complete disassembly and reassembly of an MGB. Since most parts are identical from '64-'80, it will cover just about everything you need to know about working on your MG. If you are not British then some of the terms can be a bit confusing but you should know the lingo anyway. Or so say the purists. The book is inexpensive enough to buy 2 copies, one for the shop and one for in the house (so you can keep it clean). Just the money I saved in doing my first brake job on an MG paid for the cost of the book and then some. There still is no substitute for having an Abingdon mechanic looking over your shoulder but this is a great second option."
2,Haynes MGB book,"I'm not a big fan of Haynes books but they are better than nothing. The MGB book lived down to my expectations. While there is enough information to get work done, several procedures did not apply to my car even though they are stated to. For instance the pictures and procedures for servicing the cooling systems did not match my vehicle at all.This has been my experience with other Haynes books as well. I recommend getting them only if there is no alternative such as Chilton or the ""factory"" manual."
4,Good Reference Manual,"This is a good general reference manual, but not real comprehensive for a lot of repairs. It is worth the investment."
4,MGB Automotive Repair Manual,I ordered the manual so that I could have a source reference in a rebuilding job I have. If you really want specific information you will want this manual.
2,ALL THE SAME,"This manual is basically a condensed version of Robert Bentley's ""The Complete Official MGB"". I now have two manuals with the same information."
2,MGB Summary,"This manual covers most of the basics but has general information only and lacks a lot in specifics regarding different models. Body and Chassissection is not very in depth. It is a simple repair manual and not a restoration manual. Haynes could make three, possibly four, manuals for this car and be more specific."
3,Very informative for basic MG,"Very informative,but not enough info on after market improvements.Example: Original Stromburg Carb. vs. Weber Carb. Over all a good book to start with."
2,What happened?,"I absolutely LOVE JCS. I got so excited when they released a new album, because all the songs on their other ones are so powerful that you just can't stop listening to them. In listening to the first track, I decided it was okay, but the rest of the album sucks. What happened? The songs are so b-l-a-h. They sound so mainstream with so much more of the regurgitated riffs and themes of some of the more mainstream bands out there today, such as Creed, which not surprisingly they make an appearance (so glad they broke up!).I am thoroughly disappointed."
3,Good,"It's good, but not as good as their previous two albums. A few tracks really stand out (Strange, Dead Sleep, Unshaken and Paper Dolls). The album seems to be more pop than ""Pushing the Salmanilla Envelope"", but doesn't have the catchy reggae/ska hooks that ""Bring your Own Stereo"" had. Where I found every song to be great on their first two albums, ""re.present"" disappoints with more ""filler"" songs (Quitter, Beautiful, Unshaken). And even these songs aren't too bad.My favorite song is ""Paper Dolls"", I love to sing along on the ""blah blah blah blah""'s. The one song I really hate is ""Ghettoverit"": a slow song about how the ""Thug Life"" is so '97. The song is just not funny, and it's boring. This is a first for me, a JCS song I don't like."
2,Doesn't Practice Make Perfect?,"JCS has had plenty of time off from its last album (engaged in some serious legal battles with their formal label). As a major JCS fan, I have been nothing but disappointed with this album. I lacks the raw energy and passion that the earlier albums possessed. JCS has been on a scary road toward becoming a pop band. Haha needs to return to his roots, and ROCK. With talks of another album, we can only hope that JCS hops over the VIRGINIA COUNTY LINE, look at my NOSEFACE, and think of BLISS.But, JCS still is by far the best live show in the region."
4,Five years old and going strong.,"Just a few words in defense of the Fantom Cyclone XT: I bought mine at Target 4-5 years ago and it's always worked well. It has a few minor quirks which some seem to think make it worthless: The lights don't last long, but they're cheap and easily replaced, and to those who experience shutdown, mine did that for the first time recently. I popped out the small prefilter on the canister top and couldn't see through it, so I ran it under the faucet to rinse out the dust, tapped the water out, and after it cooled down, the vacuum worked like new. Not a big deal. It really is a good vacuum."
3,Vintage concerts,"Made in EU in 1999, Serial# 5-21233-2, Playing Time: 75 min.This CD is a re-issue of the limited edition album ""Picture This Live"" released in 1997. ALL the tracks are live: tracks 7 to 12 in Philadelphia during the ""Parallel Lines"" tour; the other tracks are recorded in Dallas during the ""Eat To The Beat"" tour.The recording quality is good, and the versions are raw and full of enthusiasm. This album doesn't have the polish of their latest ""Live"" album, but the band is performing at 100%, flaws and all. Of special note is the last track, a 15-minute medley of the T.REX classic ""Bang-A-Gong(Get It On)"" with the Bowie/Iggy Pop penned ""Funtime""."
5,live is the best!!!,blondie has no doubt earned the title of the greatest new wave band ever!this album was worth the money i highly recommend you get it blondie fan or not it is a must have!!!!!!
1,O-ring stopped sealing battery compartment,"I bought this one at Walgreens because of the low price. The unit worked and cleaned well until I had to change the batteries a few months later. After that, the o-ring at the bottom didn't remain the water tight seal for the battery compartment. The whole unit eventually died. Phillips should offer a free o-ring, battery cap replacement kit."
3,Doesn't work if left in cold and humid bathroom - Updated! Now it's broken!,"Updated December 10, 2011. After having the trouble mentioned below for a brief period, now the brush doesn't work at all. Brush did not last long (~3 months). Disappointing reliability. Buyer beware.____I've used the toothbrush for a couple of months now. I'm basically happy with the toothbrush and the replaceable batteries are definitely a step in the right direction. My toothbrush stopped working (just one short buzz each time I press the button) and I eventually figured out that if I keep the toothbrush outside of my cold and humid bathroom then the toothbrush works normally again (so far). I guess that condensation inside the toothbrush prevents normal functioning of the toothbrush; once the condensation evaporates then the toothbrush works again (for now). The problem I have is definitely not just low batteries (the toothbrush has the same problem with new batteries)."
2,Not good for travel,"I travel a lot and having to carry a separate AA charger is big & bulky. I eventually bought the standard sealed unit for about twice as much. It includes a very small charger that takes-up almost no room in my suitcase. Plus when the batteries eventually wear-out, the price is not high to replace it."
4,4 years and two brushes later,"I've owned two of these brushes, after the non-replacable battery in my first sonicare died I found this much cheaper version where you don't have to worry about the batteries dying while on the move. Both brushes have come up with the same problem: the battery cover eventually stops staying on. I've never really had problems with water getting in the battery compartment, but once the cover stops sticking then you can't really use the brush. However, they seem to last as long as the brushes with rechargable batteries and at 1/5 the price I think this is the way to go."
2,Toothbrush disappointment.,"Too nosy for me, (high pitched) I need to use ear plugs just to brush my teeth. It has one speed, too fast.."
2,Stops working after a couple months,"Love this toothbrush when it actually works but have had to replace it 3 times already, because it just dies for no reason. Philips doesn't give me any solution on how to prevent this from happening and won't give me my money back, just says ""We'll send you another replacement"" without acknowledging the actual issue. Don't buy it!!! They are very frustrating."
4,Great for the price,Great Toothbrush for the price. Have four and only had a issue with battery cover on one of them. That was after around a year of use.
1,Poorly designed toothbrush,"I bought this toothbrush and within 3 weeks, it stopped working (probably due to water leakage from the poor design) and the cap that keeps the battery in broke. I requested a replacement from Phillips and received it, and the replacement broke too!! And faster!! I got a full refund from Phillips. It did seem like it was doing a good job for those few weeks that it worked, but the design is flawed and should be taken off the market."
3,EXCELLENT,GREAT ECONOMICAL TOOTH BRUSH THE BATTERIES MUST BE REPLACED AFTER ABOUT 2 HOURS OF USAGE THOUGH
1,Short-lived,We bought two of these from Sam's Club and both died within 3 months. At first we thought it was a battery problem but then we discovered both toothbrushes took water into the battery chamber. It was pretty yucky in there and despite cleaning the chambers and replacing the batteries the units both died an ugly death. I liked the way it made my teeth feel really clean and will likely upgrade to a unit that does not require batteries.
5,But It!,"I was initially skeptical that the battery powered Sonicare could do as good a job as the rechargeable Sonicare toothbrushes that I have owned since the product was introduced years ago. Not only does the toothbrush clean my teeth as efficiently as the more expensive rechargeable models, it is great for taking on long trips. I have not had a cavity in 15+ years - something I attribute to my Sonicare toothbrush."
3,Seems Like a Good Toothbrush to Me... 3.5 Stars!,"This is a nice toothbrush for a first timer like myself. Strong brush power comes from the two double A batteries, although it is very noisy. It seems to suck tons of power, so only use fresh batteries, but I use rechargeables now to keep costs down. I don't get it wet, except for the bristles, so I haven't got any water or corrosion inside the battery compartment like others have complained about. When I rinse the bristles I angle the toothbrush down so all the water runs off it into the sink (I can't believe how many people complain about battery compartment water damage). I've used it for about 6 months now with no problem. I used a coupon to buy ($20) it so if it breaks I won't be too concerned. I'm going to make sure to keep it dry though to avoid any future battery problems. Seems fairly decent so far..."
2,Works great until it dies,I also went through 2 of these like a previous reviewer...they work great. But after its second set of batteries it dies...so for 2 of these toothbrushes I got almost 2 months of use total.Would send it in for a new one but...I feel that it would likely break again and I don't want to contribute too much to the good ol' landfill. Otherwise though it is a fantastic toothbrush. Not sure I'm a fan of the timer.
2,Does anyone have the same problem?,"I really had a lot of fun for the first month I owned it. Two AA batteries lasted almost one month. Compared with other rechargeable models, this one was fairly cheap. But after 5 months, now, it's so annoying that I have to change batteries every 3 days! How come a toothbrush eats up power so crazy?! I'm thinking of buying a rechargeable toothbrush."
5,Great toothbursh,"I think they might have fixed these because mine seem to seal water tight with the o-ring.If you set the brush horizontal instead of vertical, water won't run down it and get toothpaste all over."
5,Thank you Sonicare e3000,"This is a tool. Use common sense and don't leave it out in the rain. I'm delighted with my e3000 and thankful to Sonicare for creating it.Due to the death of the American spirit of ingenuity, soon they will be no more.There are 100 ways to take a little time and effort to care for this wonderful tool for years and years of use. Read other reviews for that. My teeth never felt so fresh after each cleaning, as if I just left my dentist's office. I brush more now than ever before as the e3000 is so easy, fun to use, and simple to clean after each use. Not 8 or 4 but just 2 little minutes and the job is done. Voila! Cleanest, whitest teeth ever. 5-Stars all the way. Thanks Sonicare!"
4,Perfect intro Sonicare,"My 12 year old was ready for a move from a basic toothbrush and while this may not be as great as model as the Elite series, she loves it and is a really good transition model from basic brush to Sonicare."
5,"Typical, excellent Sonicare product","I've been an engineer forever and an ER nurse for 38+ years; I know hype and BS at first glance and diplomacy has never been my long suit. I've been using a Sonicare toothbrush for many years. It was initially recommended by my, superb dentist dentist, a man who chairs the dental program at a major NYC medical center. I suffered from the beginnings of gum disease and, a month after using a Sonicare toothbrush, it was gone. When I briefly stopped using it, it came back. When I started using it again, it went away again. The engineering and construction of the Sonicare products is impressive; very few products, of any sort, are made this well. This battery model - which I plan to use while RVing - is another example of the company's superb products."
1,Absolute Garbage,"My old Sonicare died after and few years and I had tried using several different brush types, manual and powered, attempting to find a cheap replacement. After a less than stellar annual check-up, I decided to just buy another Sonicare.I saw this model and could not believe how little it cost. My old one was over a hundred dollars. It worked great too. I saw no difference other than the lack of the quadpacer timer thing. Unfortunately, it died in less than two weeks. And no, it was not the batteries, the thing is just dead.I suggest you buy a rechargable 4100 for forty or fifty dollars. I have been using one for a few months now with no issues. It has the great cleaning action of a Sonicare at a reasonable price. Same as with the cheap battery powered model, the brush turns off after two minutes but does not have the quadpacer or any other fancy features."
2,leaks water into battery compartment,"The first toothbrush i bought was eating batteries like crazy, new set every five days. Then i noticed water leaks inside the battery compartment and shorts them. Paid special attention to how to close - no good. Returned to amazon, thought it's a bad one, got another one - still sucks. I don't really understand how water goes inside but it kills the batteries. The only way to keep it working is to open and dry it every few uses and also keep it stored horizontal (not standing).Update: my solution to the problem was to dip both battery ends in petroleum jelly (Vaseline) to protect them from corroding from water, then then liberally top up the cap with more jelly before closing. being hydrophobic, that petrolatum seal seems to keep water away from the battery compartment."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I received this as a gift for Christmas. It worked great for the first few weeks, and my teeth were noticeably cleaner. However, it then would start shutting off before the 2 min interval was up. The intervals got shorter and shorter. Then, after another week, it died all together. Don't waste your money on this cheap Sonicare, just buy the more expensive ones that are better made."
3,Poor sealing; otherwise great.,"Like others, mine worked for 6 weeks then broke. There was water in the battery compartment. Even after drying it out, it still didn't work. I am returning it to Philips and will be getting a new one.Why stay with this flawed device? Because it cleans better than any other toothbrush I've tried. I no longer need to floss when I use this device. It effectively cleans the spaces between teeth. I like the fact that it takes AA batteries, and it is much cheaper that other models in the model line.Note, if you have sensitive teeth, this toothbrush is a little painful at first because the vibrations are high frequency and amplitude."
1,Worthless,"Totally worthless purchase. For one, it's noisy compared with other power brushes i've had. It began cutting out on me, at first I thought it was the cheap batteries that came with it. Then I replaced them and it continued to cut out. Bad connection inside or shorting out? I kept taking it apart to look at, changed batteries again and still nothing. It wouldn't run anymore except for one other time, then i turned it off to rinse and it wouldn't start again. It sat unused for a few weeks before I decided to pitch the damn thing in the garbage. I never did bother finding the paper work to return it. Isolated case of a lemon? Who knows. I wasn't impressed with the sound and the excessive spraying it did."
3,Develops black mold in the inside,"I've had one of these for several years and it has not broken, BUT water does get inside and creates black mold that takes a lot of time to clean up. I love the idea of not having to keep it plugged in, but they need to redesign it with an o-ring between the brush head and the base. I spend about an hour per month cleaning the inside with silver and q-tips."
3,Small but Good,"I must have missed the part about this being sized for kids. Other than the pint sized brush head, it works as it should."
1,This product is very very disappointing!,"I bought this product in Dec. or so, but only one month later this product is defective already!!! This is the second chance i gave to Philips. I really like the brush, but what's shocking me is that it can only last not even a month. I tried to change the battery and everything, but still no use. Now I wonder how do i get a refund or exchange. Or maybe there's no even a warranty or anything for this product!"
2,Not ideal for gum cleaning,"The best kind of electric toothbrush (according to my hygienist) is one with a rotating top to the head, that way it gets the gums better. I ordered this one and I don't like it... besides the lack of rotating head, it is very loud and I feel like I'm going to wake up my roommates. :)"
3,ANSWER,I Haven't bought one yet but here is something for users....WHY DON'T YOU TRY TAKING OUT THE BATTERIES AFTER EVERY USE!!!
1,defective!!!,this is my second purchase. I used to love this toothbrush...My new purchase stops working after two weeks!! it looks like it came defective from the factory...very disappointed... where is the costumer service to ask for a new working toothbrush??? I want what I paid for
5,Great price and all the brushing power I expected from a Sonicare!,Not rechargable but the batteries last a reasonable number of brushes before needing to be replaced. I love the feeling of Sonicare clean teeth. Well worth the price!
5,the best kind of toothbrush,"I have used the rechargeable sonicare for years. I got this one for trips to pare down on what I have to pack and now I much prefer it since the batteries last for months and I don't have the charger taking up space. The battery cap can come loose a bit and allow water and paste to get into the battery area, so I am always checking it and giving it a little push back in."
3,You get what you pay for,"I bought this tooth brush about 3 months ago because it was the cheapest of the Sonicare models. Sonicares clean better than any other electric tooth brush I've tried. That said I now wish I had spent a extra $15 or $20 to get the rechargeable model, because I've already spent that much replacing the batteries every week. I guess that's what I get for being cheap.Pros:CheapCleans your teethYou don't need an outlet to charge it.Cons:No quadrant timerEats batteriesVery picky about it's batteries (batteries that still work fine in other devices won't work for this)"
1,This brush is a LEMON!,"I have to chime in with the other reviewers. At first I loved this brush. It feels amazing in your mouth (hold your jokes please)! But within a few weeks or months it will stop working. I actually bought this brush at a drugstore on sale for $20. The first time it died, they exchanged it for me. When the 2nd one died, I was able to get a full refund. This brush is a lemon. You should know and you've been warned."
1,This brush WILL quickly self-destruct...DO NOT BUY!!,"Do not base your purchase decision on any reviewer who has had the product for only a day, two days, or even a week. My Sonicare Xtreme e3000 brush died about 3 weeks after first use. All owners of this brush will, sooner and probably not much later, find that water will invade the battery compartment and corrode the metal contacts and your batteries. That's what happened to mine and, after reading other reviews here and elsewhere, apparently is also happening to all other users of this brush. The O-Ring rubber seal suffers a design flaw and cannot maintain a water-tight seal. It's very obvious from the moment you first install the batteries...the bottom cap just will not seal tight enough! This product needs to be recalled by the manufacturer and Amazon needs to stop selling this garbage. I'm assuming that I'd be better off if I had instead bought one of Sonicare's reachargeable brushes with the sealed battery."
2,A Real Disappointment,"This item worked wonderfully for about 1 month, then water must have gotten into it or the battery connection went bad. I would have to change the battery every week, later, realizing it was not the batteries but the connection.A cheap replacement for the real thing."
1,Nice while it lasted,"For the two weeks or so that it worked, the Sonicare Xtreme e3000 did a nice job cleaning my teeth. Then it stopped working. The problem seemed to be in the on/off switch. I sent it back to the company, which refunded my purchase price a couple of months later."
4,A short length of electrical tape and you're good to go!!,A short piece of electrical tape resolves the water infiltration issue where the battery base connects with the brush holder. My experience with the rechargeable units was that they lasted for 2-6 months and then died. Phillips was pretty good with warranty service but the no charge replacement handles again lasted around 2 months. For the AA battery model I recommend fresh alkaline batteries rather than reusable/rechargeable AA's. The battery contacts in the brush handle sometimes dent the battery electrodes and can interrupt the connection. Fresh AA's quickly resolve that issue. I probably get 2 months from a set of AA batteries. The brushing action is exceptional and this Sonicare provides strong performance and great value. Seal the battery compartment from water with electrical tape whenever you load fresh batteries.
1,Cheap but lousy,"As others have said, water gets into this unit very easily. I am having problems with it after only 3 months. Spend more money and get something that will last. The only saving grace for me is that I got it for free."
5,SoniCare Toothbrush,Fantastic toothbrush! My mouth has never felt so clean! I like the built in timer that automatically turns the brush off after the 2 minute brush time! Good battery life and a soft touch around the gums are added benefits!
1,Defective - two of these Xtreme quit working,"I tried... twice. But both of these ""toy toothbrushes"" quit working. In the past I had a great experience with an older Sonicare toothbrush and was hoping for similar quality with this simpler, cheaper and replaceable battery powered device. No such luck. After a couple weeks it just stopped. Phillips was kind enough to replace it but the replacement also failed after a couple weeks. My advise is to avoid the Xtreme and buy the higher price device (or stick to the simple manual toothbrush)."
5,Don't waste your money!,I've had 3 of these and none of them lasted more than a month. DON'T purchase this toothbrush!
5,"Fantastic, especially for travellers",This toothbrush is awesome. I have used other battery powered toothbrushes from crest and colgate but this is in it's own class. The sonicare technology from the much more expensive rechargeable versions is apparent. This toothbrush cleans your teeth like no other battery powered toothbrush I have come across and for $30 its a complete steal.
4,Last same amount of time as the rechargeable,"I purchased an original Sonicare that lasted about one year, so I decided to try cheaper e3000 with replaceable batteries. This one last almost the exact same amount of time. Both the e3000 and rechargeable Sonicare I had worked pretty much the same. I just purchased my second e3000."
1,DON'T BUY THIS MODEL...do buy Sonicare,They quickly begin leaking and stop working. I bought one because I LOVE Sonicare. In fact I participated in one of their original studies before the product became available at the University of Washington Medical Center.I received one of their first models after participating and it lasted almost 7 years. Bought another and it lasted about 3 years.Couldn't afford the higher cost models and bought this as a temporary solution...well it lasted a matter of weeks before it stopped working.I WILL however buy one of the lesser expensive rechargeable models though because you cannot get a comparable look and feeling of clean with any other toothbrush!
3,Non functional design,"Good cleaning. But why did Sonicare do away with the colored rings on the base of the brush? There is no way for my husband and I to tell our brushes apart! We resorted to a piece of tape, which is kind of like the Apple antenna problem. I spent all this money on a toothbrush to put a piece of tape on it?!! Also, there should be a way to change the cleaning mode without having the toothbrush in your mouth."
1,aweful packaging,"The packaging that comes with the brush, not the amazon packaging, but the Phillips packaging is the worst. It took me way too long to get a knife, box cutter and scissors to open the heavy duty plastic packaging. And, in the process, I cut my finger on the side of the sharp plastic. Why is this product child and adult proof? Tip to Phillips: make it easier for consumers to access your products by using simplier, echo friendly packaging."
4,Money Well Spent,"I read all the reviews, many speaking about the seal (or lack of) at the bottom. Although I did not add any lubricant as was suggested in the reviews (not a bad idea) I have had no problem at all. NOTE: I first brush with my mouth full of mouthwash... (oversharing I know) but it is a wet process over the sink. I have checked and the seal is fine. The timer works well for me too because I tend to be in a rush in the AM."
4,Feel the buzzzzzzzz,"Switched from a different kind of ultrasonic toothbrus to this, and WOW this leaves your mouth all tingly and clean.It was a little rough at first, taking a bit getting used to, learning how to use it without it splattering toothpaste everywhere. But, now that I have the hang of it, I'm impressed! It's great.I have had no problem with it not getting water in the battery. I assume Philips knows these things get used around WATER and have the battery compartment sealed sufficiently as long as I'm not using it in the tub or something! It has a 2 yr warranty and only cost $20ish so it's not a big deal if it does break - I would call it a defect if it gets wet inside and expect it to be replaced.Glad I got this to replace my old toothbrush. Excellent device and great for this price! Love being able to swap out any set of AA batteries I have too (I use rechargables.)"
5,I think It's great,I think the toothbrush is awesome. I can tell no difference from this and the more expensive sonicare brushes. No issues with water in the battery compartment for me.
1,Cheap but...,"I had purchased this initially and while i was impressed in the initial few months, that impression didnt last for long. I unfortunately told my wife about it and had her buy it too and now we have 2 unhappy users.Mainly its the battery compartment.. which is in the bottom (blue cap). If you dont dry up the brush before storing.. then overtime the water can enter the batt compartment and corrode the batteries. The corrosion prevents the batt caps from even closing... which prevents the mechanism to operate. Both the brushes are not working as of this morning. I can see why its cheap(er).We are planning to go with the real (waterproof) sonicare."
4,Pretty good,I have had my Sonicare for over 9 months. I have to say that I am pretty impressed with it for a battery operated toothbrush. Had one of the rechargable sonicares and I like this better. I have one each for myself and two kids. Two are still running fine after 9 months of use the third just died. (my daughter is away at school with it so I can't say what caused the early demise.) Needless to say she'll be picking up another one. She also has a rechargable at her moms and elected to take the rechargeable to school as she likes it better.
4,Great for on the go teen!,Purchased this toothbrush for my teenage grandson. It is simple to use (batteries v charger) and portable as he moves between places. Perfect solution with Sonicare quality.
4,Two years and still brushing.,"My sonicare Xtreme power toothbrush is still working fine after two years. I'm buying a new one because after that long, well it's just time to retire this one, but I plan to buy another just like this one.The batteries last 3-4 months, the toothbrush power is great, and it takes up very little space on the counter or in a suitcase. Like I said, I will buy this one again."
2,"Works great, while it works","I had the rechargable type handle and it worked awesome! After three years the battery wasn't holding a charge and I wasn't ready to take it apart and use the ebay kit to put a new battery in, since that involves soldering. So I got this to use with my rechargeable batteries. It worked great, for a while. Now I am buying another rechargeable one since they are sealed up better, I hope it will last longer."
3,Not as good as the previous version,I think they changed the brush. The one I bought before which looks exactly the same had a stiffer brush that I think cleans better. Still better than the cheap disposable versions.
1,Did not last 2 weeks.,I changed the batteries and followed the instructions to the letter after reading the other reviews. For me if a toothbrush did not even last two weeks it does not matter how well it brushed.
1,Underpowered,"Basically, I have to change the batteries every WEEK. EEK! No way! I cannot afford this toothbrush--and since I stopped using it after third battery change, it may self-destruct-- just as they say."
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"I purchased this toothbrush to replace my boyfriend's old version since we still had a bunch of replacement heads to go through. Here we are just 13 days into having the toothbrush and it has already stopped working consistently. I agree with another post on here that as soon as water gets into it, the brush is ruined. Pretty hard to avoid considering its use. Spend the extra money and get a better Sonicare that doesn't have multiple parts b/c this one is a waste of money."
1,Defective By Design,"Under NORMAL use and care, this device stopped working two weeks after purchase. As others have stated, water/toothpaste enter the interior, causing it to eventually malfunction. The store would only exchange for a new unit, so here's the bottom line: I'll just keep exchanging every two - three months for a new unit. How's that for 'Eco-Friendly'?"
1,Nice while it lasted,"I really enjoyed this toothbrush for the eight months it worked. The other day, I couldn't get it to turn on at all. I installed new batteries, no luck. Cleaned out all the ins and outs, still no luck. I'm a bit heart-broken."
1,This item WILL stop working within a couple of months.,"My mom recently bought me, and then herself, this Xtreme-ly CHEAP toothbrush. Within two months it had stopped working despite buying new batteries. When I called her to tell her about it, she said that her had crapped out as well. Seriously, read all the one star reviews here, check out the comments verifying that this does and WILL happen. Maybe the higher priced Phillips Sonicare brushes are actually worth something, but not this one. Avoid at all costs!!!"
2,doesn't last - water gets in,"This would be a good tooth brush had they designed it better. Water gets inside and stops it from vibrating. Some times I have to take the top off and separate it from the bottom for a few hours for it to dry out, to get it to work. Also, gunk builds up inside of it and looks pure disgusting after a few months. I've had this about 7 months now and I'm tossing it in the trash."
1,water WILL get into the unit - a waste of money,"My dentist recommended this toothbrush. I didn't want to pay the exorbitant price for the plug in so I purchased this unit. We use rechargeable batteries in my house so replacing the batteries would be no big deal. After a week of use, it stopped working. Thinking maybe I had defective batteries I replaced them. The toothbrush worked on and off for another 2 weeks then completely stopped working. Phillips did agree to send me a new one but unfortunately, that stopped working in just a few days. Water getting into the battery compartment is the problem, no matter how careful you are.If you don't mind spending 100+ dollars, buy the plug in variety as I really did like how it cleaned my teeth. Otherwise, skip it completely."
3,Pro's and Con's,"This is my second sonicare e3000 - the first replaced after about 8 months. For the money this is definitely worth it. If it fails in the first few weeks or months contact them as sonicare will stand by it. It is a SONIC toothbrush for $30 or less so what can you expect. Last time I had the battery cap/connection problem. I find the mold inside worse this time for some reason? I think this one allows more water into the top, but the battery compartment tighter - so inconsistent quality. Unfortunately this unit takes the more expensive heads. But I read that once the battery dies on the expensive unit/flexcare then you basically have to replace whole unit - with that money you can buy like 4 of these! I think this is the best bang for your buck and recommend to use rechargeable batteries to save the planet! Good luck."
5,Great item!,"After thinking about buying one of these to replace my normal toothbrush I bit at this one because of its lower price. There really is a noticeable difference! My teeth feel smoother and cleaner after brushing than with my old brush.I have not had any problems with water intrusion, but I've been careful about not soaking the thing. I've also only had it about a month.Overall I'm very happy with the product and would buy it again."
2,Great while it works,"This toothbrush is wonderful, when it is working. Unfortunately, serious design flaws allow moisture to enter the battery compartment and corrode the battery contacts. This is mildly annoying, at first, because you can usually get it going by tapping the toothbrush on the counter top. Eventually, after a month or two, the battery contact will be so corroded that no amount of tapping will help and you have to go in with something abrasive (like sandpaper) to clean up the battery contact. You would be better off with one of the rechargeable models that have sealed handles."
3,"OK, but not as powerful as an Elite","I lost my Sonicare Elite and bought the Xtreme as a replacement. It does a pretty good job, but is not as powerful or effective as the Elite model. The AA batteries fade pretty quickly, and don't effectively brush your teeth near the end of their lives. I went in for a check-up, and my hygienist noticed the difference. The rechargeable battery models are more expensive, but you get what you pay for."
3,"Worked great, then the batteries cost more than the toothbrush.","Worked great for 10 months, than the batteries had to be changed every two weeks. Also the batteries would leak every now and then. But when it worked, it did work well. The automatic timer is a great feature."
1,"Sonicare e3000 - bad, bad, bad","Bought the Philips Sonicare e3000 upon advice of my dentist. Worked flawlessly for three weeks. Then one morning, it was absolutely dead. Replaced batteries several times; cleaned out all compartments per instructions. Nothing works. Obviously threw away the receipt after purchase. Recommendation: Don't buy this product! Wish I had read the reviews prior to my purchase."
1,WATER LEAK WITHIN 2 MONTHS,"I bought this item 2 months ago. I worked so well, I couldn't believe it. The bristles were soft, it cleaned great, it was portable, and it didn't take up room on the sink. I thought it was wonderful and was very happy with it.A few days ago, it started working intermittantly. I replaced the batteries. Still worked intermittantly. I replaced the batteries. It made a faint humming sound. I knew there was a problem and decided to look up reviews on the internet. I saw people were having the same experience and it was due to water leakage ruining the batteries.I will contact the Philips Co. and let them know. I really love this toothbrush and hope they will correct the leak situation. When they do, I would definitely buy a new one."
3,Not re-chargeable!,"I didn't read enough into the product to realized that it was not a re-chargeable toothbrush. Was disappointed, however for the price it couldn't have been. Anyways, for what it does, it's a pretty good toothbrush."
4,A must for Grieg fans,"Because Grieg is one of my favorite composers, I was delighted to get the complete incidental music to Ibsen's play and not just the standard Suites 1 and 2. Blomstedt and the San Francisco Symphony do a fine job of conveying the many moods of Grieg's masterpiece. Listeners need to be prepared to hear singing and dialogue in Norwegian, but its inclusion gives the performance an operatic feel. For those of you familiar with Suites 1 and 2, give a listen to ""Peer Gynt Hunted by the Trolls"", a highly dramatic work;then, listen to the solemnity of ""Blessed Morn"" and ""Solveig's Cradle Song"". I think this CD will enhance your enjoyment of Peer Gynt all the more."
1,Little Pim,"Maybe if your child already knows French this might work, but not for my kids. My kids are 2 1/2 and 7 1/2 and do not watch a lot of tv or movies so when they are allowed to watch something they sit glued to the tv. This held their attention for about 3 minutes and my 7 1/2 year old asked me what the heck was going on with this thing. I told them to be patient and watch but it really did not make any sense to me either. Definitely one to skip, sorry Little Pim."
1,Don'y Buy It,"The fact that Saving Private Ryan is one of the movies reviewed in this book shows you how much of a quickie it is. There are many grammatical errors, the reviews for each movie are short and dull, and most of the time the whole damn story is told. Don't make the mistake I did. What a waste of 20 bucks."
5,At last-a coloratura mezzo!,"Let me confess, first of all, that I have never been convinced that Cecilia Bartoli deserves quite all the adulation she receives. Second, I have always had difficulty completely enjoying ""The Barber of Seville"" - and other Rossini operas - because of his passion for coloratura mezzos, common enough in his time but an almost extinct breed today. If a modern mezzo manages to get through the difficult coloratura passages without totally disgracing herself, she still sounds old enough to be Rosina's mother. Bartoli not only sails easily and delightfully through the hard stuff; she manages to sound like a young woman in the process. The rest of the cast is excellent, and, being almost completely Italian, puts a liitle more zing into the acting than non-italians can achieve. Hearing this has not only put it on my wishlist; it has made me reevaluate Bartoli."
2,I like more Callas and De Los Angeles!,"I' dont like this version, because Cecilia Bartoli is very good for sing dificult ornaments, but not very efficient in the high notes -in a lot of moments she shout and gasp-, and I think that her vibrato is, sometimes, excesive. I recomended Callas or Victoria De Los Angeles."
4,Handel's Solomon (Paul McCreesh),"It took a long time to arrive, perhaps because it was ordered from USA , but you did warn me of an approximate delivery date. I suspect it should have a cardboard box cover, which it doesn't (I may be wrong, as it was all wrapped in cellophane, but I'd like to know). I haven't finished listening, but I'm enjoying it so far, and like the fact that it is the complete, unadulterated original Handel version. It certainly doesn't disappoint."
1,Terrible waste of my $18.00,This Cd was deceiving to me. I am so sorry that I bought it brand new!I expected harp music and it was the classics so don't be fooled by the Harp on the cover because you hear very little Harp being played in the music. I would say 14% Harp all the rest fluffy classical music.
5,A damn fine single and a U.S.Tour as well,"Pinch me. This single is fantastic and the remix disc is worth the extra cash. It just seems to have more meat than the Billingual stuff. Cannot wait for 'Nightlife'. On top of that, a U.S. tour! Neil and Chris will have lots of my money this year. I give it gladly."
1,You call this a book,"I can not beleive that someone would even publish this sort of trash. I really hope that the author did NOT expect to get rich with this sort of filth. I am a PROUD african American Woman, and this book made me feel ashamed of my heritage. We no longer live in the early 1900's the world has evolved, it's time that these close minded southerners realize that they are not from this country either!!!I am guessing that the two good reviews that this book got were from family members, if so what a shame, but I see why, family is probably the only people that read this book. Save your money!!!"
1,Is the author of this book serious ? This book is a joke .,"If I could give this book a minus star, I would, but since one star means ""I hate it,"" that rating seems appropriate."
1,Worst Book ever!!!!,"I can't believe amazon even sells this junk!!!!I am glad I checked this out at the library and did NOT pay for it!!!!Yeah the book title is right, Lets get serious about writing a book people actually want to read, the only thing this book was good for was using to start my bon fire."
5,Chronically Happy,I ordered this book and within two days I had it at my door. It is an excellent book for those of us who have chronic diseases.
3,"Cheerful, but nothing new.","She has a lot of good advice and makes you feel empowered, but really there's nothing new in this book and she didn't really offer solutions other than the obvious."
3,"If you are a jazz or Denzel Washington lover, this is it.","This movie is not for people looking for a great movie on jazz or romance but it is a highly stylized depiction of jazz today. There really are young musicians trying to bring jazz back into the public conscious, but alas, more people would rather hear ""Achy, Breaky Heart"". It definitely shows Denzel at his finest (not necessarily in acting). The costumes are great and Washington's song ""L-O-V-E"" is worth seeing the movie. The part about the movie that caused my to argue with my then boyfriend was that it seemed like after Washington was used up, then he offered himself to Indigo-- and she willingly took him back. Of course, he saw it as the fact the Indigo was the more devoted of the two of his women. Whatever! Be prepared to be stunned by the set, outfits, and music."
3,A Somewhat Decent Spike Lee Picture,"This is finally a Spike Lee movie, besides Malcolm X, that actually makes sense - somewhat. If you are into movies that have great jazz, this is it. However, I couldn't really stay with the story because Spike Lee spent more time on style and symbolism than actually substance, like many of his other movies. At times it seemed like Denzel Washington's and Wesley Snipes' talents were being wasted in poorly developed scenes. Nonetheless, the jazz in this movie is stimulating, and Bradford Marsalies is great."
3,Good to add to your Denzel collection,"Impression I had the first time I saw it: A jazz musician with a more intense passion for his musice than either of his lovers, loses it all and offers his used up self to the lover who will take him. Horrible love story, typical male. Impression in subsequent viewings: a band member who is envious of every thing the star has, including his woman, a devotion to a best friend, the unfair politics of the white man holding the purse strings to the main attraction, Harlem, a woman with unreleased passions of her own. Rebirth and renewal. Forgiveness and redemption.Great color, costumes and music. Don't look for any profound messages in this one. This one is all style and no substance. Denzel is at his handsomest in this one. My girlfriends and I wanted to nurse his wounds after his fight scene. And the song ""L-O-V-E"" is classic!"
2,Very AVerage Film but the Soundtrack is nice,"a couple of things jump off the Bat first Spike Lee is a frustrated Musician inside&2nd he has watched music films and taking the parts he felt were essential to making this picture.this film doesn't work mainly because And I agree with Spike Clint Eastwood messed up Bird so bad.I understand his take on making the music the central figure.also he takes on his buddy Prince Thru Denzel Washington's ROle between the Musician&Person.never dividing the two.much like what Prince did in Purple Rain.the power of control of everything.and the shade of the Sisters is Brought to Light so many times in this film.Spike tried to many things to make this film work.Denzel&Wesley are cool but stick to the soundtrack to hear the tight Playing Of Braford Marsalis,Terrence Blanchard The Brother does all of Spikes Scores and his POPs Bill Lee a very talented Musician.Right Idea but way to basic Story&FEEL.STILL SPIKE LEE IS A VISUAL GENIUS."
1,Mo' Crap,"This is the worst film I've ever seen. Spike Lee has made some okay movies, I don't think he's made one which doesn't have flaws, but this one, to me, was unwatchable, I don't understand what the other reviewers are talking about."
3,Ok Spike Lee Film,"This movie is only Ok in my book. It has great production values, spirited performances and striking actors. The trouble is the story isn't one that I come to care about. The characters seem to be acting in their own space and rarely interact with each other. It's hard to know whether Denzel Washington's character loves either of his women but you know who he is going to stay with because that woman is played by Spike Lee's sister. The film in many ways is typical Spike Lee - long, takes place in New York City, etc. This time the variety of characters just don't jell as one whole movie. It happens sometimes. In other movies he's made the film comes together beautifully, in this one it just didn't happen as well. That doesn't mean I haven't seen this movie more than once or discount it when talking of Spike Lee, I just think it is one of his lesser achievements."
4,A Dentist Reviews This Product,"There are four things a dentist looks for in a toothpaste:1. ADA seal of approval2. Fluoride to protect and strengthen enamel3. Low abrasivity to prevent wear on enamel4. Good taste for continued useThis toothpaste has all the above. It is a good toothpaste and as a dentist I recommend it.Like most toothpastes, it has sodium laurel sulfate, and if this ingredient irritates the mouth with sores, canker sores, etc., I recommend Biotene toothpaste.The ""Whitening"" claim made by many toothpaste manufacturers is a bit misleading. Too many people associate ""Whitening"" with bleaching, when in fact, it has nothing to do with bleaching. The whitening claim can be made because toothpaste removes plaque and does ""whiten"" the teeth.Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig, DDS"
2,May not fit,"The construction appears to be strong and more than capable. However, in order to mount the unit the thickness of the metal requires that you have an at least 3/8 inches or more of extra threads on the rear axle on each side of the bike. (1/4 inch for the wheel support and 1/8 inch for the brace. If you need to use the spacing washing, add another 1/8 inch.) Because of this, it would not fit on my child's bike."
3,glad I know how to improvise,"I was very impressed at how strong and sturdy the training wheels were, the instructions were pretty simple to understand, HOWEVER.....If you plan on buying this item you should make sure that the bike you are going to put them on has extra long bolts that stick out the side of the frame because if it doesn't then it will be impossible to attatch both the training wheel and the frame brace. Too late for me so me and hubby put just the training wheel on without the brace and are hoping for the best since it is too close to christmas to find a replacement part."
4,Keeps my kid off the ground,"These do what they need to. Good quality and easy to install. We replaced some older ones we got at a bike shop (not the same brand) because all the rubber came off the wheels. It looks like this wont happen with these. They look like they will last a long time. I will repost only if they don't work out for any reason, so no post is good news."
5,Big League UPS.,"This compact beauty will give you UPS for 4 outlets, enabling you to run an avg system for about a half hour! It also features 4 surge-protected only outlets, a USB circuit (or an RS232 in another model) and a phone or ethernet in jack plus 2 phone or ethernet jacks out (acts as a splitter). It also has voltage regulation to smooth out spikes & dropoffs and finally adds hot-swapability for its 525VA battery. It is a nice package of features in a nice compact, user-friendly box."
2,"Very nice dishes, but...","OK, a revision - like other buyers, I have to complain about the durability - the edges chip VERY easily. I now have 2 chipped dinner plates, a chipped mug and 2 chipped bowls. We will be replacing these dishes with Fiesta Ware as soon as we find a good deal!!I'd give them 2.5 stars now...These are truly very nice dishes, and I have no complaints about their appearance or quality, but I have 2 small issues that prevent me from giving 5 stars:1) The edges are so wide that it's tough to get them into my smallish cupboards.2) They are quite deep which seems to prevent them from getting completely clean in the dishwasher (or maybe my dishwasher [stinks]!).Overall, very nice, with a very attractive color."
2,Not very durable - chips easily,"I bought this set and the brown set and both chipped in less than two weeks. I guess that's what you get for $50. I had originally wanted to get matching serving pieces when they became available, but have decided to keep looking for everyday dinnerware that is more durable."
1,Save your money,"I sent this set to my daughter as a gift thinking that the image looked fantastic and they were quite a bargain. She called last night to say the gift arrived and she hoped it was a joke because this is one of the cheapest (in quality) sets of dishes she's ever seen. She only unwrapped a mug and one dish and put them back in the box, hoping that she would be able to return them. I sure hope I don't have to pay to re-ship a 23 pound box! If only she lived nearby, we could break the dishes into little pieces, turn them into a lovely mosaic, and chalk this up to a learning experience."
1,great colors and design but it ends there,"I had the same dishes for 18 years, Pfaltzgraff Heritage. I was quite tired of them and replaced them with these. Big mistake. They look great out of the box but they chip VERY EASILY. And, because of the great, deep colors, chips are quite noticeable. I'll be lucky if these last 1 year. My most disappointing and only disappointing Amazon purchase to date."
2,Lovely color but...,"Though this set is a wonderful color...it is quite heavy and not suitable for children or the frail. Also, it chips easily and often. We still use it but sparingly. If one has troubles holding a heavy cup...then this is not for you.They are great for microwave heating because they do not transfer heat like glass or Corelle. The price is right but spending a bit more for a set that does not chip so easily would advisable. If you will be using regularly with children or the elderly....their weight would be an issue."
1,Too Breakable,I purchased two sets in 2003. Most pieces now are chipped and this is definitely not a product I would buy again.
5,Simply beautiful,"This dinnerware is simply beautiful. The pictures cannot do it justice. The dark specs in the glaze are really interesting. Presentation of food is impressive on the dark plates (the midnight blue). If you like the look and size, I recommend this set highly. One caution: the plates are too large for a really secure way to load more than a few in my dishwasher, and they will chip if they are banged around. I have been happily using them (all pieces, including mugs) for more than 8 months, washing the dinner plates by hand, and so far can find only the tiniest chip on one plate, which may have been there originally. The other pieces go in the dishwasher and survive. The mugs in particular are really nice, great for coffee lovers. This is the only set of dishes I have owned with mugs I like to use every day. To feed a large family, or let kids clean up, this set might not be the best choice, but otherwise highly recommended."
1,Not recommended,"These dishes are not for everyday use. I give them one star for fabulous style and colors (I bought three different colors), but that's the most I can give them. These dishes chip very, very easily, and the underlying ceramic is bright white, so you really can't miss the chips. Plus, I'm not sure that I buy the ""dishwasher safe"" label, because these get unbelievably hot after short periods in the microwave, and change color also. I DO NOT recommend that you purchase these if you plan to actually use them."
2,Buyer beware!,"I ordered this set about 8 months ago in the blue. Since then it has chipped, faded, and generally disappointed me. When I first got it, I was very pleased. I guess if you hand wash it, it would last longer...but who wants to? I gave my beautiful Dansk away because I thought I was sick of it to replace it with this. Sighhhhhh...I guess I learned my lesson! You get what you pay for, folks."
1,Pretty but chip easily,I was very excited about the product and bought several different colors. But they chip easily and get very hot in the microwave. I like the idea of breaking them up into mosaics pieces! I want to contact the company for refund. Any suggestions?
2,Not very durable,"I decided after 13 years with the same dishes, I'd treat myself to a new set. Although the Sabatier dishes are very pretty, they don't seem to be very durable. The glaze is very thin, resulting in lines on the plates from using a knife or other sharp utensil to cut food, and I have already chipped one plate. Fortunately, I only bought one set of 4 place settings - I won't be buying any more and will look at some other brand to replace my old dishes instead."
2,Beautiful but not tough enough,"The style and color of these dishes are beautiful, but they chip and crack at the slightest thing! I have only had my burgandy set for 2 weeks, and already 3 of the dishes have chipped. The color white is underneath, which makes the dish look very unappealing!!! Very disappointed in the quality."
2,Problem Solving Generalities,"The book's main thesis is that problem-solving should involve a multifaceted team. Yet surprisingly, every case study (filling about 3/4 of the pages) describes an individual who was successful by excelling in ONE of these facets. Not a single case study describes problem-solving by a team of individuals with different problem-solving skills, which is what the author recommends. The book might be useful for people who could benefit by thinking more about the problem-solving process; there are constant generalities describing this process. Also, I frankly disagree that problem-solving is more important in the ""information age"". Why? This thesis is also not well defended."
1,Psycho-Business Babble,This book will not help you solve business problems. The author outlines his way of thinking about problem solving. But an outline about something as general as problem solving is simply not useful.
5,2 thumbs up!,This book breaks down Romeo & Juliet so anyone can understand Shakespeare. Highly recommended. Perfect if you are a teacher or a student.
4,No Fear Shakespeare,"I was pleased overall with product. I didnt expect writing on it, but it was reasonably priced and arrived in a timely manner. The book itself is wonderful for my daughter who is using it so I am pleased overall with service."
4,Romeo and Julie,I bought this for my grandson for school work. The book was delivered in a timely manner and in good condition.
1,Airport Model now obsolete,"The airport is a wonderful accessory from Apple. The one being offered here (model M7601LL/B) is now obsolete and has been replaced by a better model. The old model being offered by Amazon should be pulled ""off the shelf"". Otherwise buyers should be aware that they are buying the discontinued model for exactly the same price as the newer and better model that is now available."
5,Great but---M8209LL/A,The Airport is great but I think you will find that Apple has a new Airport Base Station M8209LL/A available at the same old price. Why not wait and go with the new model??
3,...,"Whats to say? Its a well written book, the experiments are understandable. The binding on this book proved to be rather fragile for me. I'm by no means rough on my books (gotta sell them back....), but the binding completely fell apart by the end of my semester."
1,Would never recommend this seller,Ordered the book Aug. 12 with seller stating it was shipped however no tracking number provided. Have since sent additional emails to seller with no response. My class has now started and I still do not have a book or a response from the seller. Amazon now investigating and hopefully will get my money back for a book I have never received. I would never order from this seller again!
1,Introduction to Organic Laboratory Techniques : A Small-Scale Approach (Brooks/Cole Laboratory Series for Organic Chemistry),"It has taken this company a month to even send this book. It is quite amazing how slow this company and how it treats its customers. Do not expect books to come unless you want to wait til the book become a classic. Highly suggest to purchase from someone else. Luckly, I've been using a book from lab TA for my organic labclass."
4,its not fair but its good,i have a ds and this is only for gba! my cousin let me use his game and gba to play and its realy challenging! it has some good graphics and really good gameplay! it was an addicting game. to bad its only for gba. its so unfair!
5,Early bird,"I like that album because it was at the time of its composition a original new sound with original and dynamic composition on the famous Hammond organ by a famous Belgian artist ""André Brasseur"""
5,Red vs. Blue Soundtrack,Wow! Awesome band. Was great hearing the theme song for Red vs. Blue in it's entirety as well as several other songs I thought were only scores. I am surprised Trocadero don't have many other albums. This is a must have for ALL Red vs. Blue fans.
2,Wasn't looking for much.,"I bought this cd to get 2 tracks: Blood Gulch Blues & another song entitled No One. Both of these songs were longer then played in the original series and I am just happy to contribute to any one who helped with Red vs Blue.this band is not among my favorites, and i wouldnt suggest buying a whole cd for two songs, but I am not displeased with my purchase at all."
1,piece of junk,this thing is a piece of junk. poor job at blending and leaks like crazy and impossible to fix
1,Made in China,"We only used the blender once before it started leaking. It seems that the cheap blade housing cracked and started leaking. What a disapointment!! We had hopped that the Cuisinart was a quality blender, how wrong we were. Lucky for us we just made the 180 day cut off for goods return policy at Macy's.Mike"
5,Amazing blender,"I purchased this blender specifically to make frozen cocktails.....margaritas, daquiris, etc.....and it is awesome! Absolutely no chunks of ice left in only seconds. The powerful motor must be the key, as this blender (600w) is replacing a 325w blender. It is easy to use to crush ice & blend drinks....I'm sure that the other features work just as well. And I like the glass container because no stains or odors remain.....very easy cleanup."
1,don't waste your money- if you do save your receipt,"Don't waste your money on this blender... We used it about ten times and the motor burnt out. I tried calling to get a replacement blender or to have it fixed, but I didn't save my receipt so Cuisinart was very unwilling to help me. The serial number apparently dates the manufacture date four year back...the warranty only covers products made in the last three years. We will not be purchasing Cuisinart Products in the future."
1,Extremely poor quality,"I have had this blender less that six months and already the blade had to be replaced because it started leaking and now the motor is smoking. Piece of junk!!! I thought I'd spend a lot more and get a really good blender, but this was a mistake! I am not a heavy user of the blender either. Choose something else."
1,They don't make them like they used to,"I bought this so I could use it to blend smoothies. Raw milk, ice, frozen fruit, powder from grinded seeds and goji berries and it couldn't handle it. The plastic bottom broke, that is the part that attaches to the glass jar that turns the blade. I read this on another review and i thought they were talking about the big plastic part that holds it on but he meant the part that turns the blade. Well i bought it for $129 and it normally went for $149. I guess they are getting alot of these returned because now they are going for $99. Don't buy this, if you do, SAVE THAT RECEIPT! Vitamix is about $400 but I hear they last 30 years."
2,Fun but Flimsy,"This set includes several cool earth and space vehicles and satellites. Unfortunately it is not durable enough for a 4 yr old accustomed to Hotwheels and other pocket size vehicles; with many of the pieces losing components to breakage. Finding space toys, particularly rockets that are not models for launch or display is difficult. So this toy set has the potential to be fit the bill, but the durability just is not there."
5,Strong hearts only!,Al Bano has a lock box designed in the shape of your heart.A powerful lyric voice; he can hit the high notes like no other.He has enthusiasm and class that will get you going.Buy this CD and enjoy a ride through his emotional rollercoaster.
2,Not the way I remember,"Jordan puts such a twist on your favorite New Kids On The Block songs. It's horrible. Especially when you remember the way they were back in the 80's. I think this CD was poorly done, and I regret buying it. If you want a New Kids on the block album, buy one of the groups albums. Much better than his rendition."
5,Jordan Knight sings New Kids on The Block hits,I love it! Hearing him sing these songs brings back memories of Jordan in concert. (solo) I didnt realize there were 2 cds so that was a nice surprise!
3,"Even as a Committed Blockhead, Not Exactly Sure . . .","I have been a huge and faithful fan of NKOTB for 15 years. However, I was a little speculative about one former member putting together a remix album of their greatest hits. I have followed Jordan's solo career and have to admit I'm a little disappointed that he returned to his roots. Perhaps it is because he has not had much success as a soloist. Granted, NKOTB is a great place to come from - but maybe it's time to move on and not fall back when things get tough?I will admit, the remixes are really good. However, at the same time I miss hearing the other four voices. Jordan does sound good and fans can get use to the new sound.So, for those of you thinking of checking this out, go for it. But as far as a message to Jordan - NKOTB was a great thing that brought a lot of people enjoyment. However, don't be afraid to continue on your own track and find yourself. Unbelievable success will come your way once again."
3,"New Kids, Re-mix ~ Jordan Knight","I think it's cool that he's done the New Kids songs himself, but I thought he was guuna sing it the same way.I think his voice changed to much. I like the old voice."
1,Did I even have to enter a star???,"Ok..HAPPY BIRTHDAY JORDAN!! Your new CD STINKS!!!! The best song on the album was song 15. And that is because it is an original demo. I asked this of the Joey Mcintyre CD and I'll ask it of this...WHO TOLD YOU THIS WAS OK??????Come on guys, this is NOTHING compared to the first album!"
5,excellent,"While I don't care for Jordan's other solo albums, I truly love this one. What a great way to relive NKOTB songs. I enjoyed reading his fans letters of love in the cd booklet. I think ""Baby, I Believe In You"" is probably my favorite on this cd. I sure hope he sings his old nkotb songs at his concert that I am attending in a week."
5,What a pleasant surprise!!!,"Having been a fan of the NKOTB, I was not sure what this album was going to be like since it was only Jordan Knight performing their songs to different mixes....but wow!!!!! He slows down some fast songs and speeds up some slower ones. His voice sounds great and the songs carry over well to the new sound of pop music....it is a really great album for fans of the NKOTB or just fans of good pop music.......enjoy! I am not doing a rundown of each track because it is a consistently pleasant album and has 2 cd's for this great price!!!"
5,Suet cake review,Excellent bargain with quality suet. It seems fresh and holds together well when put in my holder. My birds flock all over it!
4,Great deal!,"What a great deal for the price. Larger birds In my yard (robin, crow and dove) love this and it also attracts quite a few woodpeckers as well. I highly recommend this easy to use suet."
2,Wrong item received!,"What I ordered was the Health Outdoor Products Peanutty Raisin Suet cakes...what I received are Health Outdoor Products Song Bird Suet cakes. If you enlarge the Peanutty cakes you can clearly see they are an 11.5 ounce cake. The Song Bird cakes I got are a 9.25 ounce cake. Why quibble over a few measly ounces? Because I can get 11.5 ounce cakes at my local hardware store for .99, the Peanutty cakes are comparable and I thought the birds might like a change of taste. I'll use them as returning is just a hassle but I will not order again because obviously you don't get what you pay for!"
4,Birds love it,"This is a pretty good deal per cake. So far our local love it, including flickers, woodpeckers, bewicks wren, house finches, bushtits, jays and more."
5,Fabulous guide,My son has just been diagnosed with numerous food allergies. I paniced. This book gives you an explanation of what is going on and lets you know you are not the only one out there. It is a great guide with wonderful recipes that your whole family will enjoy and they are actually easy to prepare. I love it.
5,Caring and knowledgeable author...,"I called the author (several times in fact), and felt compelled to write a review based on the quality of information I've benefited from. I thought I knew alot, but realized so much more just from speaking with the author for only 10 minutes or so. It becomes obvious that she practices what she preaches, and was very direct in providing detailed answers to my questions. Again, caring and knowledgeable are terms that describe her well. I was very impressed."
4,Written for British audience,It's a nice handy guide to VW Beetles. It is written for UK so VW's pictured are usually right-hand drive. Currency's are in pounds also. Other than that good info can be found with some handy buying guides and tips for those looking to purchase one of these wonderful cars.
2,Friedman at his most polemical.,"In the first ten pages, Friedman says something like, ""I won't pretend that I care very much about this subject, because I do."" In other words, don't read this book thinking that Friedman is being impartial! He tells you that much himself.Par example:He calls Rhody McCoy an ""angry black man,"" I think, and basically argues that Albert Shanker was justified in making 500,000-some odd copies of anti-Semitic material from a couple hundred pamphlets supposedly distributed by supporters of decentralization in Ocean Hill-Brownsville in Brooklyn - some of these later found to be fraudulent - because ""Jewish fears about anti-Semitism were real."" Etc.Read this one critically, because Friedman is making an obviously subjective argument."
3,"Superb in detail, lacks writing flow","This is probably one of the better books on this subject. It also depicts an excellent view on race relations in general.Very specific in detail, this book traces the background of the early anti-semitism and racism against the Blacks that gave a new foundation for the Blacks and Jews to have an alliance.Friedman has tons of sources, and I doubt anyone would question his tone in his message, which is mainly both sides were at fault in their break up and how unfairly people judge each other.What this books lack is a certain mode of getting somewhere. The chapters are labeled in decades but Friedman jumps around too much and you lose your chronological train of though.All in all, if you want to know ""What Went Wrong,"" them this book is for you."
2,superficial and glossy,"Rx for Survival presents a media-friendly perspective of what makes a difference in international development and health. While some of the historical perspective is interesting and useful, the general presentation is facile, missing the importance of government actions, of human rights principles, and of community-based organizations in the identification and response to the diseases presented.Hilts writes: ""In science the couplings of love are sometimes expressed in mathematical models. They are like fluid flows, or combusition spreading."" This kind of rhetoric is everywhere and doesn't do much to spread an understanding of the diseases, or the successful response to them, that the author intends."
4,spikes best,I'm a big fan and if you are you will enjoy this all in one package its all about relationships!
4,"I Like This Book, It Is Bagus","Bagus means good. I took it to Indonesia with me for two months. Indonesian is the easiest language I have ever studied, by far. Your learning curve is very high and Indonesians are very friendly and easy to talk to. Learning the language is very rewarding and this book does a pretty good job of helping you speak the language. No book is complete and you should always organize your own grammar notes and vocabulary words but this is the best book I have come upon. It also has the added bonus of being made on cheap paper so it is light to carry if you are traveling with it."
3,"Nice EZ listening music ... no blues, no soul","Despite his claims to the contrary on his website and in interviews, Keb' Mo' has largely abandoned his blues roots. This album is a collection of innocuous tunes that fit nicely into the E-Z listening category. Good background music, but there's nothing there that gives a clue to the skills and soul demonstrated in Keb Mo's earlier works."
3,NIce but could have used afew more upbeat numbers,I love Keb Mo and have all his CD's but this one didn't grab me right away. I think it is missing those special upbeat numbers that really get the set moving. It is a worthy purchase but I would like to see a little more fire on the next CD.
1,I've submitted TWO reviews for this album. Neither has been published.,"In two reviews I've stated my opinion tha this is a poor album. One star... tops. I cannot understand why amazon refused to publish it. Well ... maybe I do. Hard to sell stuff with one-star reviews, isn't it?Anyway. Here's one more try. My objection to this set is that it is most emphatically not blues. It is feel-good chick music. Billing it as blues is an outrage.I don't care if Mr Moore wants to make this kind of pap music. But trying to pass it off as blues is insulting to real blues artists.My other reviewers were probably better articulated, but since our friends at amazon are only going to trash this one along with the others, why bother thinking about it."
5,Keb' You Just Keep Getting Better and Better,"Mmm, Mmm, Good...Once again Keb' Mo' has delighted me with original songs I might never have experienced if I hadn't bought this CD. Mostly the songs are about loving and losing. Who can't relate to that. Eileen is about a love that never had a chance. And Rita is about the one that got away. All of the songs are good, however I do have my favorites...as always. For gritty, soul-stirring depth you can't beat Whole 'Nutha Thang. Quite frankly, you'll be humming these songs long after the CD ceases to play. Especially the effervescent, Life is Beautiful. I remain, and always will be, a Keb' Mo' fan."
4,a light suitcase,"This record shows Keb' Mo's usual combination of blues and ballads, like most of his precedent works. As usual, it is a refined and accurate record, with excellent arrangements and high quality of the sound. There are some differences, actually: comparing to some early records and to the last one (""Keep it simple""), ""Suitcase"" seems to be a little weighed down on the ""pop"" side of such mix, as ballads (I'm a hero, I'll be you water, Life is beautiful, etc.) prevail over genuine blues tracks. More: some pieces begin with a blues introduction, but suddenly turn to a pop song (listen to ""Your Love""). I do not know if it depends on Keb's present good mood, or if Blues is making its way towards a softer age. As for me, I own all Keb's records and I love this musician as one of the best living bluesmen, but I will keep this work for my relaxed moments.Riccardo FrauSassari - Italy"
4,"Well written, easy to digest","Heather has did a good job by writting this TCP/IP book in a very plain language with clear and concise illustration. Personally, I appreciate her way to use an protocol analyzer to help the reader to understand the bit and bytes of each packet.This book is a great reference source for those wish to know the fundamental concept of TCP/IP. Good cross reference for CCNA material as well."
3,Angel Schlesser Essential,This was ordered by mistake and I will be returning it. I did recieve the intended order actually 3 days early.
4,And now from a different angle....,"If you have read this book, or if you are considering reading this book, perhaps you may wish to consider ""Little Pilgrim"", authored by Ko Un. Eminently more readable, less stratospheric. gassho"
4,"Worthwhile Reading if You Still don't ""Get"" Emptiness","Sometimes it seems that Cook can't quite keep the seeming contradictions of the viewpoint from Emptiness in his own head, but he generally provides a coherent exposition of the Hua-Yen view. This is not an easy subject to write about, and Cook does so cleanly and for the most part consistently. The occasional lapse into a somewhat substantialistic exposition can easily be forgiven. Like Hua-Yen itself, he avoids nihilism adroitly."
2,50%,"Bought 2 of them. I had to charge them quite a few times before they would keep a charge and after that only 1 is working..still cheaper than new phones, maybe 1 was a reject."
1,COCONUT CREAM,i WAS PRACTICALLY DISAPPOINTED AS BEFORE I ORDERED THE PRODUCT I WAS GIVEN THE IMPRESSION THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COCNUT MILK AND COCONUT CREAM IS THAT THE CREAM IS 100% COCNUT MILK WHILE THE MILK IS 70% WATERWHEN THE PRODUCT WAS DELIVERED TO ME I SAW IN THE CONTENTS THAT THIS WAS ONLY 70% COCONUT MILK.
3,Basic information,"This book is easy to read and is well written, but does not have much depth. The author has proven to be able to explain clearly complex ideas, but seems to lack enough background for some of the fields that the book explores. E.g., the enthusiasm with which the author explains that in an infinite universe there are many (infinite) worlds like ours seems annoying, and has little if anything to do with information or the holographic principle. It is a quite trivial idea valid for many cosmological theories.Anyway, you can have a good time reading it, and if you are not an expert in information theory, you can find here good explanations of some basic concepts."
2,Doesn't make the case,"Apart from the section on Shannon, who is not covered well by others, I found very little to recommend this book. Much of the material is popularized elsewhere and Seife is not a compelling writer who can clarify concepts. I remain to be convinced that conceits equating the universe with a giant quantum computer really enhance our understanding of the universe, or its contents. Particularly as we still have no idea what 96% of the universe is made of (dark matter)!!! In essence, saying that information explains everything is rather like saying language is made up of words that have to be in specific patterns to make sense...a worthless tautology that sounds great but whose information content is zero."
2,Dissapointing mixture of science and lousy journalism,"A very well written book and a thought provoking one. However, it dares to claim that information is the ultimate theory that explains it all, failing short of convincing the reader that that is the case. There are plenty of exaggerated statements about how ""information"" explains everything, that energy is the same as information, etc., all of them based on very week connections and evidence. As many other authors, this one confuses theory of information, with Shannon's theory of efficient message coding. The author also keeps confused with the role of the observer in the information processes, sometimes requiring it/him/her, sometimes dismissing it/him/her as unnecessary."
2,Zero was a better book,"Not a lot of new material in this book. The author states multiple claims about the fundamental role of information as a tangible entity but does little to prove this assertion other than maybe ""proof by repetition."" Bits and pieces assembled from better sources don't usually add up to much."
2,"Seeks only to amaze, and shoehorn reality into his theory","The book is constantly sticking the word 'information' into spots where it makes no sense, as if to justify the idea of 'Information Theory.' That combined with statistics that are only there to amaze ""...If you did this once a second from the beginning of the universe to now, the odds of ever seeing a 1024-on-one-side case are about 10^290 against."" The odds are constant regardless of the time span, why add the bit about ""the beginning of the universe?"" Certainly not a book for those with a technical background, and those without would be better served by reading something else."
2,Good for light coverage of subject...,"I enjoyed the subject and was fascinated on how he tied information theory into such a wide variety of areas of science.However, I found his writing style condescending. It might be good for someone without a scientific or technical background, but if you have already read a lot about information and complexity, you find his coverage a little ""light"". [I just have an BS in electrical engineering]I found his lengthy analogies and mental experiments distracting and imprecise. They got in the way of truly understanding the science. But, others might find them fun."
2,Rather Bad,"I am not indicting his theories, but his writing. My God. Buy ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian Greene. It covers the same thing (and much more) in a more eloquent and comprehensive manner. Do not buy."
2,Unclear and even incorrect,"The author mistakes clarity for verbosity and in the end I don't know what is he trying to tell us.The subtitle says that information science can provide a different view of everything. Instead of telling us what is this view, we are forced first to go first through the usual typical topics in popular science: a oversimplified explanation of quantum physics, relativity, what is entropy, etc.When the time comes to cover the specific topics of the book, quantum computing is explained very fast, and without clarity. Regarding the implications to the ""cosmos"", the author first adheres to the ""decoherence"" interpretation of quantum mechanics, and a few chapters later he bases the reasoning in the ""multiple worlds"" interpretation, which he takes seriously and claims that is ""rapidly becoming the favorite of physicists"" [sic]. He should be better informed."
2,"Good Broad base coverage, but that's it","I didn't figure out that this book only covered IE until about midway through. However, the cover of the book has a picture Netscape Navigator on it.This book offers a huge vault of neat little tricks, but I wouldn't want to learn Javascript from it. The examples are right on par, though, for teaching you examples. If you have no other programming experience, you'll probably want to avoid this book, as I felt it was good only if you knew Javascript already and wanted to perform a neat trick or two with the stuff. Most of it involves graphical quirks rather than form processing and such.There are better books around, but this one has its place. If the examples were cross browser compatible, I'd give this book a higher rating."
3,Good for beginners,"I found this book to be suitable for delving into the world of DHTML for the first time, but it lacks support for Netscape. The index (CSS) is superb and has all the details about syntax. I would prefer to see a more comprehensive list of objects and syntax's."
2,ok for ie,this book is good if you r developing an application for an intranet rather the internet as it covers ie stuff only
2,NEVER RECEIVED DOWNLOAD,"HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DOWNLOAD THIS ITEM. DON'T KNOW IF IT IS MY COMPUTER, ????????. DON'T BELIEVE i HAVE BEEN CHARGED, BUT WILL CHECK MY AMEXCO BILL."
2,bobby nomack,The best thing about the album is probably about 4 strong songs. The rest are remakes of songs you may already have.
2,wOw,"WOW! I can't believe this cd. I've heard the original Spinnin' Around song before, and the remix was HORRIBLE!!!!! I love the Jump 5 songs featured on Radio Disney, but this was awful! Rap singers take over on some songs. This was my first jump 5 cd, I was going to get All the time in the world, I SHOULD HAVE!!!"
4,Awesome Goop!,"So, far I really like this product. It goes on easy, and works fast. It has a very light (barely noticeable) scent that is pleasant. Plus, it wipes off your finger nicely! Big plus with really little ones."
5,to fill or not to fill,"Well i went back and forth on boxes to work with my subs, could not find a box that yould work so i went with the best i could find. Still to small but with some on the fill it is amazing how responsive my subs are and how clean they sound."
4,Great condition...,"As indicated in the product info, this book was in great shape. The shipping was quick and I am enjoying the book."
5,Delicious!,"I first tried these at a Harry and David shop. When I got home, I checked online to see where I could buy them in volume and I found them here at Amazon. These are just TOO good. Tart and sweet at the same time. Wonderful fruit flavor!!Haribo Gummi Candy, Fruit Salad, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)"
5,fruit salad,"my favorite of all the haribo products, cannot find this in my area, i can only buy it in some airports at inflated prices. very fast shipping."
3,Too Sweet.,"This pretty Haribo Fruit Salad gummy candy is really too sweet for my taste. A bit more sour would have been nice. Pretty colors, but just too much sugary sweetness."
2,Not really gummy or fruity,"These are coated in sugar which make them less gummy and kind of dry. They are very firm and chewy more than gummy. They have a lot of citric acid which makes them tart but there is no discernible fruit flavor in any of them. If you ate each kind with your eyes closed, you would not be able to tell one ""fruit"" from the other. Very very disappointed. Will be giving 11 bags away and not ordering any Haribo again."
2,Not like any fruit I've tasted,"The label mentions what flavors these are supposed to be.Could have fooled me, not fruit flavored at all, at least not like any fruit I've tasted. They do have a tartness that makes them edible."
5,Excellent Performances of works that deserve recognition.,These are excellent performances of works that deserve better recognition. Gounod's symphonies are delightfull. Fully remininscent of Haydn (esp. Goudnod's first Sym.) and early Beethoven (Gounod's Second). Marriner and the ASMF provide excellent playing; superbly recorded. The Faust ballet suite is the icing on the cake.
5,"Awesome, awesome, awesome","Pavel Kogan conducted the Ballet Music from Faust. I fell in love with the music. I had to find a recording of it. I saw Marriner had done it recently and figured if he did it, it should be a pretty good recording. I was wrong, because it is a spectacular recording. The Academny of St. Martins in the Field sounds incredible, and the Ballet Music is just a good on disc as I remember live in concert. The two symphonies are wonderful to listen to as well."
3,One more Mr. Man,"We love the Mr. Men books, but it is not the best one. If you want to buy them all, don't miss it, but if you just want to pick one or a few, take Mr. Tickle, Mr. Greedy, Mr. Busy or Mr. Skinny."
1,the software does come with a manual - reads a lot like this,"i have to agree with the reviewer who said all of the info in this books is in the manual.the filemaker pro manual is an easy read and comes with the software. if you have it, read it and keep your $20 in your pocket.if you are looking for detailed information not covered in the manual, you will not find it here. the only place i have found any substantial filemaker pro information so far is scriptology, filemaker pro demystified by matt petrowsky and john osborne - an EXCELLENT filemaker pro book, something this visual quick start guide is not."
4,It is fast and easy!,I really enjoyed refreshing my skills with this book. It really saved me in a pinch. Nolan Hester was also available for questions via email which further enhanced the clarity of the book. I brought it with me everywhere and each topic could be grasped in a matter of 2-3 minutes. Thought it was great!
2,Nice Carl Jackson album - NOT an Emmylou Harris album!,"I saw this CD at a local Border's and bought it. If its title said it was Carl Jackson with some harmonies by Emmylou, I might have still bought it, and would probably give it another star in that context. However, this is in no way an Emmylou Harris album. She sings harmonies on less than half of the tracks.If you like Carl Jackson with Emmylou backing him up, a far better album isSpring Training, which is Carl Jackson and John Starling, with Emmylou and the Nash Ramblers (Sam Bush etc.) as backup. Better harmonies, better songs, better production values.I'd be willing to bet that Emmylou had no say in the release of this CD, because she would probably not have allowed her name to be used so carelessly."
3,Massage Therapists,"I am a massage therapist in Texas and I bought this video to see if I could use a few of the techniques. Well for a massage therapist the techniques are VERY basic and you have probably used all these techniques before. I only found a few techiniques I hadn't used and the ones that I did find I did not add to my massage.Although, if you are not a massage therapist this is a great video to get started with. So, I would give it four stars for a novice and two stars for a massage therapist."
4,futuristic and practical,"Apart from seeming to be a high-quality product, it also looks great. It looks futuristic and will fit nicely with similarly decorated offices. Great."
5,The way it should be played...,"Many people forget that Rachmaninov was a great pianist as well as a great composer... this album will serve as a reminder. This recording was made from a unique piano-roll system which provides amazing insight into his technical ability and musicality. Especially stunning are ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" and his own transcription of Kreisler's ""Liebesfreud"". A must-have for lovers of great piano music."
2,not for me,"This book was just all over the place. You either have to have a terrific attention span or have read dozens of books in regards to Islamic fundamentalism.I would recommend ""Journey of the Jihad"" instead."
1,Didn't work,"I bought this for use in a small outdoor fountain. I know birds and dragonflies visit it, so I didn't want to use anything that would harm them, such as chlorine. The fountain had been cleaned and I was looking forward to keeping it that way. The concentration was supposed to be an ounce for every hundred gallons, and my fountain holds maybe five, so I put in one cap-full first. Within a week I had things growing in it. Thinking I might not have used enough, I cleaned the fountain again and this time used three caps full. Again there were things growing within a week, and within two it was almost overtaken. I'm not sure if it's the heat or the humidity in my area, but this product doesn't work for me."
1,Not as advertised,"I bought this product with great hope; however, it's not lived up to the other reviews or it's own description. I have a small two-tier fountain. The product did nothing to clean the water or rid the basins of the green ugly stuff. I've tried using more and more, but still no results. Disappointing."
4,Good,"Included in this package are over 100 music contract templates that will aid you in filling out every king of music contract imaginable, from the deals you set with music producers, to the deals with promoters, to the deals you have to make with agents. The contracts all have explanatory notes and underlining information explaining each the purpose of every line in the contract. As good as this set is, it doesn't compare to ""101 Music Business Contracts - Updated Edition - Preprinted Binder / CD-ROM set containing over 100 contracts and agreements for recording artist, musicians, ... industry. Entertainment law at it's best!"" By Ty Cohen, a more complete set with easier explanation and a more intelligent structure"
5,straight to the point,"this book is very much on point.it pulls no punches everything you need to know&how to handle your business uncut.not only is Kashif a Solid Musician but He also is a On-Point Author here.this is the kind of Book that any Artist,Group,etc.. heading into the Biz should read backwards&forwards&again&again.you always hear stories of getting Ripped off within in the Business&this Book will safe a many Career from going on ""Behind the Music"" saying the same Line."
4,Good info,Great basic info on cooking temps and internal temps to have your meat turn out perfect every time. A good tool to have in your kitchen.
5,"Inspiring, with messages I wrote down and will never forget.","I loved this book! I had lost my job and was feeling down and this really put a positive spin on things. In fact, it helped me go for an even better job and get it. I like this author's spunk. I recommend this book for all women but especially for women who have been fired from a job (the author has, too) or need more self-confidence."
3,Just read a magazine instead!,"In response to the last reviewer- there actually WAS an index of names. Fuller does spend a lot of time name dropping and very little time offering actual advice. I found myself skimming the second half of this boring book.That being said, Bonnie Fuller has done wonderful things for women's magazines. I loved Glamour before she took over and adored it even more after her innovative changes. I had read YM when she had creative control there and made it a truly wonderful teen magazine back in the early 90s.I had hoped for the fun, yet preactical, advice of my favorite magazine column- The Glamour List or something similar. This book failed to offer any real or useful ideas. Bonnie tells us what she did etc, but this lacks any substance."
1,Don't buy,"I didn't like how it was attached it can easily come off, maybe for older childern but NOT for the younger ones."
1,Breaking the tie.,"I agree with both gentlemen that the music on this CD is wonderful, the execution... above par; how can it not be when the performers are top-rated and their synchronicity impeccable? However, I have to stop my compliments at this point since I did not really listen to the entire CD. And, do you want to know why? Because there is something awfully wrong with the recording... you cannot hear the fortepiano! When such passages come in, I found myself raising the volume; only to have to drop it quickly before the excessively high volume of the wind instruments destroy both my eardrums.No gentlemen, performances apart... `engineering' ruined it for me. I returned the CD for a full refund."
1,This CD is awful. I am sorry I bought it.,"Whoever mixed this CD has no concept of balance. The pianoforte is practically impossible to hear over the winds, and the horn is so blaring that it makes me want to shut the whole thing off. I would return it to Amazon if I could. Don't buy it."
4,Improves our drinking water at reasonable cost,"Even tough our local water supply is better than most in the country we use this ""just in case"" filter to obtain the best possible taste: besides, it doesn't hurt to possibly filter out some more ""stuff"". I purchased a secondary kitchen faucet and had a plumber install on same kitchen sink: the cold water line now supplies both faucets, the filtered one, and, the unfiltered one. Bottomline, best possible water for drinking & cooking, instantly, without obstructing main kitchen faucet. Additional (one time) cost? $65 for top of te line stainless faucet at eBay, $70 for plumber & T-connector. We order/pop-in new filter every year."
5,clean water,good price works great I don't like being told how many words I must use if this is the case doe'nt look for any more reviews
5,Best replacement cartridge ever,"I got this to replace the one I bought previously, but I haven't gotten around to doing so because the old filter is still working well even after 11 months use! Great product indeed!"
2,Drops water pressure quite a bit,"This dropped my water pressure quite a bit. It would be ok for a drinking water filter, but not a whole house filter."
1,Misleading picture of filter,"Be warned what you see is not what you get. The filter is pictured as grey in color but what you received is the normal white filter.Have written to the vendor, they claim that color is actually white and not grey as advertised. Not impressed with at all with their lack of integrity. Have not tested the quality of the filter but just want people to be aware of this6th June 09 , the picture of the filter has been updated to reflect the true color of the filter but this was after the negative review has been posted."
1,"Did not fit my 17"" Gateway P6825","Did not fit my 17"" Gateway P6825 in width and length. Had some damage to the neoprene. Was not worth returning due to the shipping costs. Was lucky, found somebody with a 15.4"" laptop who needed a cover."
2,Not too good,"Cons1) This book has errors in it which is quite annoying.2) The questions in this book don't really accurately reflect the actual MCAT.Pros1) Some of the techniques required for doing the MCAT are required in answering these tests (i.e. careful reading, concept comprehension), and in my opinion the topics at least in this book are true to the MCAT.SummaryIf you're desperate for questions, and are willing to put up with some of the stupidity in this book, you might want to look into it.P.S. The best MCAT questions can of course be found on the previous examine www.aamc.org !"
4,Decent for the money,"They're cheap, which is nice, however the quality is so so. One pair ended up ripping after a few week's worth of use, thank goodness I bought a second set. They work nicely however, and don't cut circulation off like others."
2,"Outlast? They didn't ""outlast"" a month.",I only wore them about 4 times before the section covering my Achilles tendon (just above my heel) wore out. I won't be purchasing this brand of sock again. They were very comfortable while they lasted.
1,Sensitive toes,"If you have a problem with excessive tread in the toe of socks, these are not for you. I purchased the socks based on all of the 5 star ratings. I must say that I cannot wear these socks at all. They cause constant discomfort and, had I worn them longer, most probably blisters. I will definitely not buy them again nor will I wear the ones that I purchased."
1,BE CAREFUL about United Integral - Bait and Switch,"I can't review the product, because even though the packing slip says ""PS2 Champion Metal Arcade Dance Pad with Handle Bar"", we got a cheap fabric dance mat worth about $20. Buyer Beware! The seller was UNITED INTEGRAL.Amazon DOES NOT PROTECT YOU on this, you are forced to deal with the seller. So instead of the summer we envisioned with the kids on the dance pad, we will spend the next month dealing with this dispute. Amazon gave us a phone # for the seller, which does not work.YOu can read more about United Integral HERE, they are a scam company and I can't beleve Amazon is letting them use thier good name to rip off customers.[...]"
5,One of Wilder's Best,"this is one of my favorite billy wilder movies. it was a shocking, groundbreaking adult film when it was released and still holds up by today's standards. Also, Ray Milland's performance is wroth buying the movie by itself. he definately deserved his oscar"
4,The Lost Weekend,"This movie has stood the test of time and I haven't seen a more realistic and horrifying film about alcoholism. The book was even more graphic so when the film makers ended the movie with just a glimmer of hope, I was relieved and I think that the ""Hollywood"" ending was appropriate for once. But be warned, this movie will haunt you."
4,Demon Alchohol,"This movie which won 4 academy awards including best picture stars Ray Milland as a debonair drunk who hides alcohol in his apartment and cares more about booze than girls. Playin an aspiring writer, he meets the Jane Wyman character when his ticket stub gets inadvertently switched at the coat rack of a theater: he is perturbed because there is a bottle in its pocket. Even though it's Hollywood, and its dated, it's not easy to watch the Milland character miss his dates, go through delerium tremens, and sink socially because of his obsession with this sometimes-very-addictive legal drug. (The coat caper is rectified by the film's end.)"
2,treatment ready,I believe this video should be used in treatment centers to show the progression and physical impairment created by alcoholism. I work in the field of addictions and feel this movie is one of the most realistic portrayals of addiction that Hollywood has ever made.
2,Loathesome...and Tedious,"I've watched many noirs, and this being a Billy Wilder picture, I had high expectations. LW now stands as the only Wilder film I have hated. I definitely felt Don's self-loathing; I loathed him too. So much so that I felt robbed when he was diverted from suicide-- his demise truly would have ended his misery and mine. Sure, Wilder was probably forced to do the ""happy ending,"" but it totally undermined and negated everything that led up to it. I know all the enthusiasts will gig me for this review, but this really is an overrated flick."
5,Important Book,"This is serious work by a visionary of the human condition not to be ignored. She may go down as one of the important writers of our time. I am not sure how she could advance her craft and vision, but I sense that her next work will be an even more stunning display of her talent."
5,IF YOU CAN FIND A COPY - GRAB IT UP!,"This is a ""space opera"" of the first order. I first read it as a very young man, shortly after it was published, and the work has stuck with me over all these years. I recently found a copy in a used book store (no, I won't sell it) and gave it a reread. The little boy in me enjoyed it as much now as when I first discovered it. Recommend this one highly and those interested in the history of this particular genre certainly should give it a close look."
4,Excellent Book,"It is one of the excellent book I read on Digital photography, it explains most common mistakes a beginner do in photography and how to avoid them. After reading this book I am able to take good pictures. Author did a good job in explaining concepts very well."
5,excellent CD,"I remember this movie when I was growing up and loved the soundtrack. I recently heard ""The Touch"" by Stan Bush and my memories of this movie just flooded in! The CD came in a timely fashion and was good quality. Thank you for the memories!"
5,Beyond Awesome!,"I never thought I would get a hold of the original soundtrack, since the new movie's come out this must've been part of the promo package. Anyway, this is something you really don't want to miss out on - otherwise twenty years down the line you'll be wishing you'd bought it. My favourites are Stan Bush's ""The Touch"" & ""Dare"" but otherwise the entire album's excellent, love the additional soundtracks as well!"
2,Good stuff.,"the stuff here is great and all BUT....SINCE THEY ADDED STUFF SINCE THE ORIGINAL RELEASE, THEN WHY NOT ALL OF IT!!!that's right customers, this soundtrack is STILL NOT COMPLETE, even with the added tracks..... 15 years ago you could get away with this, but NOT NOW...I downloaded mp3s of the COMPLETE soundtrack, and man, does it rock.... this cd does NOT do the soundtrack justice.If you are happy with what IS here, then go ahead and get it... it is still great, it's just a sour seed that the whole thing is not here....I guess what we need is the SCORE, not the soundtrack....when will THAT BE RELEASED???????"
5,Love 3 out of 4 Bonus Tracks,"I love this CD partly becasue I love the original CD, but more so becasue of the bonus tracks. I remember the first three bonus tracks from the movie; however, I was a little disapointed by the Alternate Transformer Theme (last track) and like the original Transformers Theme song better."
5,Favorite Charmed Book So Far,This is the best Charmed book I have read so far it is very mysterious it keeps you guessing though the whole book I really recommend this book.
4,Good Place to Begin,"This book is a good place to begin if you haven't made the move to digital yet. Although some of the information is a little dated with the rapid changes in cameras, there is still much that is valuable within this book."
2,Not Very Astonishing....,"Maybe if you lived a very sheltered life, and you have never done anything thoughtful or creative...this book is for you...but if you are a deep thinker, very into philosophy, and creative...this book will not help you one bit. These ""experiments"" are quite boring. I was expecting insight, and in turn got obvious ""Experiments"" which people do by themselves on an every day basis. I read thru the book and did not find 1...not even 1....experiment which was interesting or not obvious. I was very disappointed."
1,Astonish Yourself- Astonishingly Bad,"Duration: Just a few seconds.Props: The ""Astonish Yourself"" book and a brick wall to beat your head against.Effect: Mind numbing.Imagine that you are a drooling idiot of a hippie and you have a few minutes to waste. Mission accomplished."
1,Drinking water while urinating,"My friend, Hannelore, let me borrow this book. She normally has impeccable taste in literature - so I can find no explanation for this aberration, except, perhaps, the recent death of her rabbit. An interesting concept, killed by poor imagination and lack of wit. Please spare me the pain of further such banal drivvle. Dreary, dreary, dreary."
5,Masonic Throw Rug,The qualilty of this Masonic Throw Rug is far better than I had expected.It's large enough for multi purposes and looks so nice you might hang it on a wall with it's beauty to adorne.
1,wrong tense,"I'm really disappointed in this product.The tense of the verbs conflicts with the rest of the sentence structure.They should use a similar idea as their ""In Other Words"" collection where you can flip the magnet over... and the tense of the verb changes to match the subject case.Great conceptual idea, but the finished product is junk.Back to the drawing board guys!"
5,Great Set for Kids!,This is an improvement over the magnetic letters on the fridge for kids to play with. It's very fun for little kids to make their own stories and generally be imaginative. Great for encouraging creativity.
4,Mag. Poetry,Love these! I used them on my fridge and also put them in their lunch boxes (they are magnetic as well) and they loved reading what I had put together for their lunch. They are small and the ones w/ yellow writing is hard to read.
3,comfortable- but size runs small,"they look good, and are reasonably comfortable- but the sizing is about a half size small- order up one size if you like thick socks..."
2,At a loss for an ending,"Sorry, this book fails the test of keeping any central theme going. The blend of church, succession, alliance, farmers, community all failed. The series had some type of Alien religious metamorphosis between them and humanity. Some scenes were intensely compelling, but the lack of definition destroyed the effort. Only read the series if you are a 'completist' or enjoy plot failure. Thanks, Harry"
4,There was meant to be more,"After finishing this book, I did feel that this series was meant to have more books, making me suspect that the author no longer lives.In the story, Areia and the Ilanu M'dians escape and find a home on Ronadjourn. The threat of war looms over them, however, plus the difficulty of Areia in mixing with the people of the country (who remember her quite too well) and in fulfilling her role as Chaeya. Then the church of the area complains about her relationship with an alien, giving her even more headaches than she could imagine. Life was never simple for a clone.Like the previous two books, it's intense and emotional. Sorry for the mere four stars, as this adventure was not quite my brand of space opera, but it was good nonetheless."
5,Valkyrie,"As one who watched both of these special and exciting birds fly, who was there for the crash of Air Vehicle #2, and picked up pieces of A/V #1 off the 15,000 foot runway at Edwards, I can tell you that this book is the best I have seen on the topic, and probably the best on any aircraft I have read. It is amazingly specific and informative, and has better graphics than I saw in the unclassified Technical Orders in our T.O. Library at Edwards AFB.If anyone wants to know what it takes to design and build an aircraft, this is the book."
4,Good book about a great plane,"This is the best book I've seen on the Valkyrie. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars were the editing/production problems that others have noted. In my copy, Chapter 2 ends mid-sentence and chapter 4 contains several repeated blocks of text. Warts-and-all a very good book that contains lots of information not found elsewhere."
3,POP Mode,POP mode(LCD display and voice activated)goes off when not always in use by police radar. Confusing and inaccurate.
1,Worthless - lots of false alarms,"Bought this radar detector after my Bel radar detector bit the dust after 10 years. I've had this detector for about a month now and found it to be useless. Lots of false alarms on all bands, especially on K and Ka. I have yet to see a police car with radar after the alarms go off. I had to turn off the radar detector ""detector"" features (VG-2 and Spectre) as they would go off for no reason. An example: sitting in a driveway of a rural subdivision and the VG-2 alarm going off non-stop, and I live in a state (Wisconsin) that doesn't even use these types of detectors. Voice alert got annoying after awhile so I turned that off too. My old Bel detector was always on the mark with detecting police radar and rarely had false alarms. I would not recommend this product to anyone - waste of money."
4,i love this radar detector,"This radar detector is the probably the best detector i ever owned, the range is great i live in raleigh north carolina and i do lots of highway driving and this thing saved me at least 50 times from a speeding tickets and the compass is amazing and everything on it, the only dislike is out of know where it will display pop mode when theres no cops insight, like i will be in my driveway and the detector will go off like crazy. But other then that great detector i recommend it to all my friends and family."
2,Not worth it,I bought this product since I do a lot of highway driving on my commute to work each day. I wanted the added protection to avoid speeding tickets. The features of this product are good and I do like having it but I would not reccomend it to anybody. What I found out after buying it was that state troopers don't turn on there radar guns when sitting on the side of the highway. They wait till you fly by them and then clock you. This detecter does alert you but for the most part I've already seen the cop and slowed down and the police don't even bother clocking you at that point. I did take a long trip for Thabnkgiving and this was true thru many states. I havn't gotten a ticket and do slow slow down when it does go off but in my opinion there is no reason to buy any type of radar detector. Cops have become smart to them and there will never be a detector that can detect a turned of police radar.
4,My Dog The Thief,I was very happy to find this movie and really enjoy watching it. It arrived in good shape and in a timely manner
2,came with dead battery,"I ordered 2 of these for my grandsons. They were thrilled when I gave them the giant Pez machines. Unfortunately,the tiny button 1.5v batteries (PX625A) died almost as soon as the boy's began playing with them. The toy takes 3 of these expensive batteries (about $5.00 each). The Pez machines do play music (that's why they need batteries). I expected them to play something closely associated with Mickey Mouse. The information supplied on the Amazon web site only says they play music. Turns out, they play Swanny River; seems an odd choice but I guess there might be copyright issues."
5,Good pen for the price,"The only bad thing I can say about this pen, and it's very miniscule, is that it doesn't come with hooks to attach to a crate. I was hoping those would, at the very least, be included. I'll have to pick some up at Home Depot, no biggie. It's a great item for the price and gives my kittens ample space to run around."
1,I do not recommend.,I was very disappointed. The opal is just a sliver....not round and full as pictured. It also was not set down in the setting properly. I returned it. I got a replacement....it was worse than the first. I returned it. They were very cooperative with the return and issued a full credit.
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased this ring as a Christmas gift for my 12 year old daughter. I wanted to buy her a birthstone ring that was relatively inexpensive but still pretty enough that it would excite her to have a ""grown up"" piece of jewelry. The actual ring itself was misshapen (more oval than round- as if it was bent by previous wearing), the stones didn't even remotely match, and it looks very cheap- like something you'd get out of a gumball machine. I'm definitely going to return this. I paid $30 for this item- not super expensive for what would have been a child's ring, but WAY too much for what I received. Cheap and ugly :/"
5,Love this collar.,We love this item. I am a huge Cubs fan and so is the baby. The pink and blue compliment her fawn colored fur.
5,Pentek RFC20-BB Filter,"I've been using these Pentek Radial Flow Carbon filters for a number of years in my Big Blue Whole House unit. They work great and make a big difference for chlorine. Without this filter, I can smell the chlorine fumes, especially in the summer when the water temps rise and the municipal supply gets over chlorinated.I do not have a lot of sediment, but these filters are not for that. If you have a lot of sediment install a pre-filter which is much cheaper than ruining/clogging the carbon filter. I can get about the 70,000 gallons rating between changeouts."
4,good undergrad text,"This book is written explicitly for undergraduates, but is certainly a good reference for the graduate student getting started in astronomy/astrophysics with no previous experience. The chapters flow together very well and the information is presented in a clear and concise manner. The problems in each chapter connect points from previous chapters to the new material the current chapter. Solutions to the problems are located in the appendix; while this may be good when you get stuck, I can imagine some students utilizing it too regularly and not learning the material."
3,alright.,"the book is alright, the 2nd half is just qualitative discussion, most of which you've proabably already heard. the first half is the best, gives all of the equations of stellar structure, but has some really annoying convensions -- it's in MKS units, and it denotes luminosity by 'F' which really threw me off at first. hmmm, the conversation is a little uninspiring too..."
5,Clear and Comprehensible,"I read the author's previous book ""Dynamics of Complex Systems,"" which is also an outstanding book that offers a more technical and in-depth look at complex systems in textbook form. The new book, ""Making Things Work: Solving Complex Problems in a Complex World"", presents complex systems concepts in a clear and understandable manner. Most of the book is devoted to detailed discussion of real world examples from the military, health care, education, international development, engineering, and global ethnic violence and terrorism. The author provides thought-provoking insights as well as innovative approaches to dealing with the complex problems in these areas. The world could be a different place if more people read this book."
2,promotional offer,Just a promotion to try and get you to use their service. There are a lot better deals out there for regular photo printing so I would look elsewhere.
4,Quick and Easy,This program installs quickly and is very easy to use for basic tweaking of pictures. It works very well and can be used by a child to get great results in minutes.
1,Problems running on Windows 2k and Windows XP.,"Tried installing on Windows 2k Server and Windows XP, on two separate machines. In both cases, the program crashes when trying to upload photos, consuming 200+ MB of memory in the process."
5,"Wonderful service, the best quality pictures I've ever seen","I've uploaded my digital pictures to ofoto for a while now. I have used ofoto to make christmas cards of my family, and for those extra special family members, I made them calendar pictures of my twins. Everything is sent out fast, I always seem to get my pictures before I expect them, and I have always gotten what I have ordered. All I can say is that the pictures they print seem to come out alot better than what they look like on my computer screen. Try it, you'll love it. You can even get those supersize pictures, or wallets of your favorite photos."
3,Free Photos? Of course it's cool!,"Great web site, and decent interface make a good product. High quality pictures make a great product and that's what you get from Ofoto. Getting the pictures to the Ofoto sight was not as easy as Shutterfly but the end product was just as good. Take advantage of this deal...."
3,Too Odd should be the title.,"Too Shy, what can we say? Best song of the 80's from a goofy lookin' group. Limahl did do better on his own and ""Love In Your Eyes"", ""Never Ending Story"", and ""Inside to Outside"" proved it. The rest of Kajagoogoo pretty much sounds bad. I guess Limahl is the only reason why I would suggest buying this CD. Unless you're a Duran Duran fan! Since Nick Rhodes did produce their first album!"
4,Kajagoogoo (and Limahl),"Even though I bought it for ""Too Shy,"" the rest of the CD is decent. Get a copy at a good price and check it out for yourself. Four stars!!"
3,A decent collection of singles.,"There's some pretty decent material on this collection of tunes. I'm not very big on the tunes from Limahl's solo albums, but I do like a handful of the Kajagoogoo songs. ""Too Shy"" is a song that I remember from years ago (a well-written tune that happens to be fun and infectious). ""Ooh to be Ah"" is a song that I mostly like because of its cool synth intro. ""Hang on Now"" is another one of my favorites--a well-written song that can be listened to again and again. The extended mix of it on this collection is also good and an added bonus. The Kajagoogoo song I like with the other guy singing would be ""The Lion's Mouth"" (that tune's got some energy). Kajagoogoo has never been a favorite band of mine, but I still think that they released a handful of likeable songs."
2,You Synchronize,"You Synchronize for the Macintosh may be the best synchronizer available, but it is not yet ready for prime time. It operates very slowly and is prone to failure, the announcement of which is written so poorly as to be incomprehensible. Neither the documentation nor the company FAQs address the failure to synchronize, and inquiries have produced no results. When the product works as advertised it seems to work well, even if at a snail's pace. However, when the synchronization fails one wonders what has happened, and there is no assurance that data has not been lost."
1,Much Ado about PHP Black Book,"This is not a very well-organized book. The examples are generally over-simplified. My biggest complaint, however, is with the cd rom - it includes ""Source Code"" from the examples in the book. The source code is merely all of the snippets of code in each chapter jammed into a few html pages. For example chapter 17, ""Objects"" has several ""Example"" pages which do not work because objects are illegally redefined several times within the same page. The author does spell it all out in the chapter, but the examples are simply not usable."
2,More like 2.5 stars,"It took a lot of my time to read and understand, most of the examples in the book are pretty much useless, you won't often need to know at all. Even though ""PHP essentials"" is slightly outdated, it presented with useful examples, I can finish that book in a day or two, very easy reading. Moreover, it doesn't cost any money at all if read it online, I bought it on sale for 4 bucks. The best way to learn is by studying and actually doing examples. the black book is served more like a reference book to me."
4,This is an excellent intermediate php book.,"I got this book as a christmas present from my mother (how's that for geekiness -- it's all I wanted for christmas!).I've used it extensively to help me write a content mgmt system, helpdesk, and filemaker/php xml integration. It's been a real gem. Now, it's not for those who need to learn, and some of the bad reviews for the book reflect this. And I think he moves along a little fast sometimes, as many authors tend to.But this book is basically organized into 1) intelligent discussion 2) class diagrams and useful information on what's built into php and 3) excellent howto examples with code.It's a great hands-on guide for building, and I reccomend it for those looking for a great desktop reference.To the author: good jobStatus: We definitely reccomend this book to intermediate php coding clients in our hosting company."
2,Barely okay. Look elsewhere.,"Had I not learned the basics of PHP elsewhere, I would not have learned them from this book. It is poorly layed out. Instead of systematic description of the language and its design issues, you get someone skittering around, mixing important details with unimportant fluff.I recommend Welling and Thomson's PHP and MySQL over this title just in the PHP department.To add insult to injury, the author is quite egotistical and thinks you will be amused by his practice of using himself in his sample code. Puleaze!"
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed with purchasing this book.It has a very diverse coverage on PHP and is the not the best books to beginPHP scripting with. i found it difficult to wade through the examples presented in the bookand also ended up finding several bugs in the code presented in the book.I was disappointed that this book didn't deliver my money's worth
3,For the beginner,"I bought this title for my niece who likes knots almost as much as I do.Originally, she was searching for a knot to use to hang a heavy object on a plaster wall.For more advanced people, I'd recommend the classicAshley Book of Knots. But for a beginner, this little volume has good illustrations to enough knots to make it very useful for a variety of purposes. I even imagine that my niece's two grammar school girls can enjoy making the knots, because they are presented in a very clear fashion which makes reading HOW almost immaterial."
5,very useful and easy to follow,My wife absoutly loves this book. She uses it to teach girl scouts how. To tie many different knots. The delivery from this purchase was much quicker than the stated time frame and the book was in perfect shape.
3,Not ideal for kids...,"I rather like the book, but I bought it for a young knot tying friend and it ended up being beyond his ability and he quickly became disinterested. Not saying its a bad book, just ""knot"" what I had in mind."
1,Not for the iAudio Like Amazon Claims!,"I purchased an iAudio U2 MP3 player for someone as a gift. On Amazon, they recommend this case as an accessory. As already noted by another user, this case does NOT fit the U2 player and I am just re-emphasizing that point. Do not buy this as an armband for the U2."
4,Just be aware...,"I bought an iAudio U2, and Amazon recommended this as an accessory. Although I saw it was for a different model, I thought it must be the same case. Well... it's not. This is model specific, so don't buy this unless it's specifically for the 700.Having said that, I liked the design of the case - easy access to the controls and the elastic armband looked great. Now to find one for the U2."
2,Unfortunately Doesn't Last,"I bought a 700 series iRiver to use at the gym, which came with this Armband, at first it was great, but it didn't last, there are two clasps which don't sta attcked well, and the pocket that holds the mp3 player itself is held together with a glue that comes undone after a few weeks of daily use."
3,something for history lesson,You should know Russian language and history to understand movie.And you can buy it from other stores if you seach internet. As politics dominate Russian mentality the movie avoid anything negative about Russia and its people and you have to figure out reality.
2,,"Even if one saw this album as a different band from the Dissection that released the timeless Storm of the Light's Bane in 1995, there really isn't much to be impressed about it. Yes, there's an unfortunate In Flames/Gothenburg sound coming from this, which I wasn't prepared to admit after the first two listens. Aside from a few cool solos and occasional mighty riffing, the rest of the material cannot be compared to older Dissection. This band is much more capable than this. This band was one of the few that used to be able to capture an atmosphere without the inclusion of keyboards. This is a major disappointment, and many Dissection fans are already infuriated at this change. This is still a Metal album by all standards; it's just that the hype was too enormous for this album and it does not live to any expectations. 2.5/5"
2,Limp,"I'm not going to be as harsh as the guy below me, but this album is a dissapointment. Lack of blastbeats? I don't know if that's that apt a criticism of Dissection, who even back in the day sounded like black metal light, think black metal with plenty of 70s rock. Kind of what you'd expect from a black metal band from goteburg to sound like. He still has loads of melodies and the music is decent, but the it does sound forced, heavy handed and frankly a little limp. The lyrics are wretched, even for black metal. It reads like a religious shout out list. It might impress 14 year olds but not me. A shame as I've been looking forward to this album since he was convicted. Oh well, at least Ishahn released a solo album."
1,What a dissapointment . . .,"I can sum up this album pretty quickly. Slow, boring, weak, repetitous, and anything but aggresive. I cant believe that after seven or so years in prison this is the best Jon could come up with. Their first two albums are my favorite melodic black metal albums ever, hands down. But this, what a sad day in metal history. If this wasnt Dissection, I might give it two stars. This is like Metallica releasing load after the black album (except the old Dissection would devour the old Metallica.)Where are the blast beats Jon, where is the melody, the passion, and excitement of The Somberlain and SOTLB? Its definitly not here."
5,An amazing collection ~,"This is the same recording as:Prokofiev: The Five Piano ConcertosAnd there are certainly more reviews for the newer (and MP3 format) version. But if you do not yet have a collection of the Prokofiev piano concertos, this is among my personal favorites and Ashkenazy brings his usual talent to the stage. Previn and Ashkenazy always had great rapport and it shows in this collection. The #2 is of particular magnificence."
2,Not what it was advertised to be,"My book, Apollo 16, was sent with a torn back cover, taped with scotch tape, and the CD ROM that was supposed to be part of the book was not included with it. It may have been an oversight, but this is not what I would call a good quality used book."
5,Great product,"If you're like me, you are tired of the long list of ingredients in creams that you can't pronounce. I just wanted something pure and natural yet effective. I really like this, my skin soaks it up. It's a great moisturizer."
3,One very annoying flaw...,"Everything about this thing is fantastic except for one thing: it skips. It skips sometimes for no good reason. I lay it flat on a table and listen to Rumours by Fleetweed Mac which is 40 minutes long and the sound drops out for 1 second during one of the songs. No biggie. But then I listen to an accoustic version of Everlong by the Foo Fighters and this same problem occurs three times. I hooked up my Jukebox to my computer to check if it's maybe the mp3 file's problem and of course it plays fine through my pc. For the most part it doesn't skip. Just be prepared for the sound the cut out for about 1 second for no reason whatsoever every once in a while. I've got about five hours of music on my jukebox and so far I've only noticed a big problem with Everlong. Maybe Archos hates the Foo Fighters or something. I've checked the newsgroups and others have complained of ""skipping"" as well so my unit isn't defective. They all have this flaw."
4,Takes some getting used to...,"In the world of smaller and smaller, this product seems to have missed the boat. A little smaller than a casette player and is heavier than my old mp3 player and cellphone combined.However, one cannot overlook the huge storage. I already have 991 files on it, and still have 70% space left.HOWEVER- it does have some drawbacks. You can only go through windows explorer to go through the files (a hassle to some...) and you really can't organize them and put them into folders because if you like a shuffled playlist, it does NOT go between folders. So you must either keep it one big mess or constantly keep moving files.It takes some getting used to, but i'm not really complaining. It sufficiently fits my needs, and what more can you really ask for?"
1,"Nice gadget, while it is still working","Finally a mp3 player to my liking. With 20gb hard disk I was able to store all my music and take it with me and enjoy my music all the time. However this lasted only for 3 or 4 months. After that time the machine stopped playing numbers. It would start a song and after 10 or 30 seconds it would just stop responding. Reformatted the hard drive, and put all my music back on the jukebox with the faint hope that this would solve the issue (mwuhaha). 5 hours later I still didnt have my music playing again. 3 weeks and 3 emails to archos later (still waiting for any reply) I ordered the creative jukebox. Hopefully that will continue to play...."
2,Once I get it installed...,"Who knows what I'll think of it. But I can't install it at all now, because I have WinXP and because I am trying to install it on a laptop that has no floppy. It won't, for some reason, let me install the drivers off my ZIO - perhaps because I have only one USB port on the laptop and it won't ""see"" both the ZIO and te Archos at the same time. I'm not completely sure, but due to the driver problem, and the fact that XP won't install the drivers that came on the CDRom because they're not ""signed"", I have a nice, expensive, plastic paperweight right now, when I want to be listening to music.Piffle."
1,I wish I could have given it ZERO stars,"I swear this is the worst purchase I ever made... in my life... ever. It worked for like a month, before it stopped. The tech support employees are minions of Hell. I emailed them four times over the last month and a half, NEVER got a reply. Once they realized that I wasn't going to buy more accesories from there website in hopes of keepin my Mp3 player working, they stopped replying. I will admit that I hate Archos. I am very bitter towards them because they sold me such a terrible defective product and refuse to do ANYTHING about it. I am basically screwed out of the 450$ I have spent on it and being a teenager I don't come across money very easily it took almost six months to earn enough money to buy iy. I hate ARCHOS do yourself a favor and buy a burner... or creative labs, or Neo... just NOT archos."
1,VERY BAD PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE,Customer support does not have a free 1800 #. Everytime I call I get voice mail or told they are in a meeting. I cannot turn on or off unless it is connected to the power supply. When I turn it off the LCD remains lit. I am trying to return this product.
1,Don't buy this product!!!,"The only good thing about this product is that it doubles up as a portable hard drive. Other than that, I received Disk errors right away and reformatted it at least twice. The Tech support and Customer Service was just horrendous. I had an email thread (because there is no 800 number either) trying to work it out with tech support spanning over 3 months.Forget about running with this thing on the trail. Even while i was on the treadmill at the gym wasn't even holding it (it was stationary on a holder), the hard disk flaked.The user interface is a beast, and to scan through only 3 GB of music was a time investment.On top of that, the $50 rebate never came either. Boooooooooooooooooooo!!!"
1,Pure Garbage,"My wife bought an Archos Jukebox 20. I plugged it in, spent a few hours copying files over, and waited for it to finish charging. When it finally finished charging, the display read ""HD Error"" and the unit refused to do anything. We returned the unit immediatelyMy wife wanted to try another one, so we bought another unit. AGAIN, I plugged the new unit in, spent a few hours copying files over, and waited for it to finish charging. When it finally finished charging, the display read ""HD Error"" and the unit refused to do anything.I have never had something not work out of the box beforeDo you want to risk these problems?"
1,"Caveat emptor! NO tech support, NO repairs!!!","Despite a promising product with great battery life and storage, when you have a problem with the Archos company, better tell it to the Marines! The tech support email address on their website bounces back, the 800 number doesn't work, and they are in a permanent state of the busy signal on their only their known toll telephone number. What a disappointment. Hard drives on these units are easily damaged, but even when you are happily willing to pay fully for a repair, just try to get an RMA number. JUST TRY!!"
1,Enjoy it while it works... cause it's gonna break soon.,"If you are considering buying this, notice how this product gets a lot of good reviews and but yet a large number of people absolutely hate it. That's because it's wonderful until you have a problem, which believe me you will. I love the concept, lots of storage and great sound, but I personally have gone through two and have decided that my cat is a better source of support for this product than Archos will ever be. Two different family members have also had theirs break. I'm going to try the Nomad product."
1,Total Waste of Money,I have sent mine back to Archos twice due to malfunctions. Their help line is not helpful at all. Do not buy this
1,BUYERS BEWARE,"Do not buy this, it was a waste of money and time, it sounds like a good deal with how much memory it can store, but it is one of the worst purchases i have made, i payed 200 for it and it has yet to work right, the first thing that happened was that the usb would not sink up with the computer, as soon as it started to do that the screen went (meaning that it was a blank screen and you couldn't tell what you were doing), it would still play, then it started to no sink up with the usb, so all the songs that i had on it are lost and all the software on it. now the thing won't even play. this was one of the worst purchases i have ever made, i will neaver buy another product from archos!"
2,What a Pain!,"Every description written about the ARCHOS is true except a major detail a consumer should know. The Jukebox is delicate. I purchased mine and have had to exchange it 3 times (as of now) due to it's sensative design. There are specific instructions, though simple, to follow while loading and playing files. If the user accidentally presses the wrong buttons, the mistakes wear on the hard drive and it won't be long before the device locks up and fails to work. I regret buying the ARCHOS. It's a terrific idea, 500 cds on one portable drive. But it's a bigger pain than it's worth."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Alright, this product works really good for about a month or two. Then it breaks. This wouldn't be so bad if Archos had a real customer service department but they don't. If you email them they won't reply and if you call them they won't pick up. They sent me someone else's broken Mp3 player as a replacement. IT has been one big disappointment after another."
1,A piece of Junk.,"I have replaced it once and the second one is just as bad. The hardrive freezes up,randomly gives unintelligible messages and is so unreliable, I can't take it anywhere. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere."
3,Technology not come of age as yet,"I busted my trusty MD player and was trying to decide between a MD player and an mp3 player. I went for the Jukebox first because I liked the idea of having my whole music collection on one player. However I did return it in the end because it was simply too big and clunky. There were some other issues in terms of portability with the batteries only lasting 6 hours or so and the simply tacky carrying case provided, which further added to the bulk of the item..in short I would advise anyone who wants to have a good selection of music to listen to for extended periods of time to invest in an MD player, at least until hard drive based mp3 players become smaller and more robust."
1,Piece of...,"Bring it home. Spend two hours loading it up with songs and all you get is ""HD ERROR"" on the display. Taking it back."
2,Not far enough,"This product is a major step in the direction of personal audio devices. The big problem, and I do mean BIG is the operating instsuction book! I have never been so frustrated in my life in the electronics field. Nothing is clear, no step by step flow on how to do anything. I have recorded and erased hour after hour of music when Ithaught I was dooing it correctly.Audio quality is another story, however. It's nothing short of GREAT!!! HELP IS NEEDED WITH 'HOW-TO' MAKE IT WORK"
4,Overall Good,"When i first recieved this product i was very excited to start to use it but found out that you have to charge it for 10 hours. The instructions that come with it are horrible, but once you get it working it does everything that it says. Once you get used to it you will love it. I recommend it, very fast. One other thing that is annoying is the fact you have to go through every song to get to a song that starts with a ""Z"". This is laborious and slow."
2,Pass on this one,"I bought the Archos 20 GB player and took it back after a few days. The problem is the sound. You can hear the hard drive spinning in the background of soft sounding music, which defeats its whole purpose.The interface is not very useful and making playlists is very labor intensive. I returned it for Apple's ipod which I am VERY happy with. It is worth the extra money and makes the Archos with its cheap plastic buttons, poor design and inferior sound feel dated."
1,"Archos JukeBox Studio 20 - poor product, poor service","I give it one star only because there is no option for 0 stars. This is the worst of all worlds. A product that even when working is not worth the price. It consumes batteres much faster than the 8hr advertised and the output (volume) is real low - at the highest setting it is difficult to hear while jogging or other activities. My unit quit working after about 1 month. I returned it to Archos under warrantee and went through customer service hell, they replaced it with a Jubebox 6000 (smaller 6GB version) without my permission. All attempts to get corrected have been blocked by poor customer service. There is no 1-800 number to customer service so I'm forced to call long distance numbers only to be put on hold for 20+ minutes and then promised call backs that never happened. I'll never buy from Archos again and would not recommend that anyone else even ocnsider their products. There are plenty of reliable products and manufacturers out there."
4,"So far, so good!","I just got mine yesterday ... and so far, so good. No problems making it work with Windows 2000 and my iBook. I'm able to transfer files back and forth between the PC and Mac easily by plugging the Jukebox into both.I admit that all the negative reviews scared me, but I wrote it off mainly to user errors. The unit isn't very intuitive, but if you're a gadget freak, you'll figure it out after a few uses.I've loaded over 125 albums and backed up tons of files from my PC and still have 10GB of storage left. I took it to the gym today and had no HD error problems as others have reported. It's just a little heavy to sit in your shorts pocket.All-in-all I'm very happy... so far."
1,Simply HORRIBLE!,"I purchased this hunk of junk 2 days ago. After putting about 3 GB of music on it and listening to it, I was very excited about having it. Worked perfectly. I got up the next morning to use it and it was toast. Didn't work. Had errors, power supply is all messed up....couldn't do a thing with it but throw it against the wall. So, I took it back, got a new one and had the same problem. Please do not purchas this product. It is an absolute piece of junk and Archos should be ashamed of themselves for putting it on the market. You will never get any tech support....and you will be VERY disappointed if you waste your money on this."
4,Great AntiPod,"That's just what I call my Archos, as people ask me if it's a tape player. It's a very reliable product, and reasonable priced. It doesn't force you to use a program like iTunes or Napster to transfer music or any other file to it--It's simply click and drag. I love how it can store my entire music collection.Downsides:-Size: it's heavy and won't fit into most pockets...not good for running with-No Auto-sort of files. Everything has to be done by yourself which takes a while to get going.After about 2 years my battery has worn down A LOT--but, i've gotten very good usage out of it. I would recommend install in the ROCKBOX program as it allows for more options like playing basic games and just more options in general. Also, if price is not an issue, look into the next player up that plays videos as well for about 50$ more."
4,Good So far- Studio 20 gig,"I have used my player for three months and have had no problemwith it.It takes a while to charge and it does get warm ... I let it just do it and it has suffered no damage. I haven't been changing battries, just topping off every day (don't believe that battery memory ... .. does not or ever did exist, except in very precicely timed discharge/charge cycles.)I don't expect a hard disk spinning at 3000 rpm + with a read head riding just microns above it to be happy being jolted about by a runner or such.I use a solid state (NO MOVING PARTS) rio mp3 for those activities. A 128 meg of storage works out just fine for that.I have some concern about ARCHOS as a company mainly because I know nothing about them or if they will last. Having said that I have a ton of stuff no longer supported by well known companies still in business. My stuff may as well been made on mars for all the support i get.I see a lot of ID ten tee complaints in these reviews."
1,This thing dose not work.,"Not long after I bought this product, it broke... The product is horrible for walking, or running. The hard drive became ""bad"" only three weeks after buying it, and I didn't do anything to cause it to malfunction. All in all I wouldn't buy this product again if I had to..."
4,"good, but not easy","got the jukebox 20g, the directions for setting up are not clear, nor is it compatible with windows xp. but, the bottom line is once you work through the bugs, it's fairly simple to drop and drag mp3 files to it. you should record them at 160kpbs to get good sound. 96kpbs is very distorted on music with high ranges."
4,You CAN have it all!,"I have waited for someone to finally have an MP3 that allows you to take more than a couple hours worth of music with you. Benefits: Easy to sync with the computer (will also backup regular files if you want). Works with MusicMatch (Great for automatically finding names, tracks, and creating folders). Line out for hooking up to small speakers. Looks like I will end up with around 500 CD's on this thing. Small and easy to carry (the picture makes it look pretty big but it fits in your hand) Down Side(?): Only two, One, the headsets [stinks]... Get some good old fashioned ear buds. Two, it takes awhile to figure out how to move through the thing (use playlists!). Bottom Line: It is great. Forget about deciding what music to bring with you - bring it all!"
1,Be wary of the archos,"I would like to say that be wary before you buy this product, this is a harddisk, so things start spinning. instead of flash which is less volatile (IPOD) so, the thing is, there are lots of problems with these hard disk, you cant go totting it around just in case you scratch the internal spinning harddisk, and also, even w/o doing that, I still have lots of problems with it! music freezes up, there are lots of hard disk errors, you can't scan or back up stuff more than 4 gbs in size, and now, its completely dead, why? because when I plugged it out from my computer, it suddenly registered a (final) hdd error, and this is suppose to be plug and play!! I have had it with this junk, and I am getting a separate hard disk and a separate mp3/cd player, im sorry but IPOD is too expensive too, even though it is better. Think and review before buying archos, thats my advice, even better, try it out for a while. This is one of the products you'd wish you did, trust me."
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"Seems like a great little gadget and it would be, if it worked. It worked for the first few months I owned it. Started having all these problems with it and ARCHOS replaced it under warranty. The replacement then worked for a few months and is now doing the exact same thing as the original one.It does not work as a portable mp3 player. You turn it on, it turns itself off 2 seconds later. It works fine when it's connected to the computer, but if all I wanted was an external hard drive, I would have bought an external hard drive. This is a huge waste of money! Do yourself a favor, buy an iPod."
1,Not user friendly,"First off, the software's version that comes with player is out dated. It caused me to loose the 7.5 version of MUSICMATCH JUKEBOX; in return for a 6.0 version. Second, once you do install the software, it takes an eternity to figure that you need more downloading to convert WAV music to MP3 music. The craftmanship and layout of the player indicates that it will probably not withstand the test of time. You must jog through a menu to just adjust the volume. Don't even think about playing the player before the recommended 8 hours recharging time. I let my player recharge for 24 hours, while I attempted to download music. It still didn't play after that. Lastly, the instruction manual is useless at best. It doesn't help you what so ever in downloading music to the portable devise. Afer 36 hours of playing around with it, to no avail., I finally sent it back. It's really not worth the time and effort put into it. Maybe, it's a better hard drive back up?"
3,should have included FM radio and it's recording,looks good !!!should have included FM radio and it's recording
5,One gorgeous shoe!,When I opened the box I was surprised that the shoe was even prettier than the picture. The quality was excellent. I have received tons of compiments on them. These have become my favorite pair of shoes!
4,THE VERY BEST OF THE YARDBIRDS classic oldies,"The VERY BEST OF THE YARDBIRS is the epitomy of sixties rock and roll. Several of the songs on this cd have been twords the top of the charts. EVIL HEARTED YOU and FOR YOUR LOVE are probobly the most recognized songs of the YARDBIRDS. The YARDBIRDS sound is pretty much the same as the BEATLES. Which means then, that it is different than the EAGLES. The YARDBIRS were never as popular as the BEATLES, with the baby boomer generation. This can probobly be atributed to there lack of origanil sound and lack of quality lyrics over the long term. this is one of those British clone bands however they really can not be faulted for this as it was the the thing to do at the time. in the song I ANIT GOT YOU they sing about women and there Mojo and how they have every thing exept whats really important to them. Either way its a great CD."
5,One of the best (relatively unknown) artists out there...,"Back in 1995-96, I worked as a bartender in East Windsor,CT. Lisa used to be one of our favorite live acts to book. She was an excellent performer and a really sweet person. This CD was the only one I knew of until recently...I'm thrilled to find that there is another one. Her sound is unique, beautiful, haunting, moving, infectious...all at once. Her ballads are deep without being mushy. Her up-tempo songs are excellent, as well. Wish you'd done more with your talent, Lisa!!"
3,Good First Step,"This is my first metal DDR pad. It was a wonderful step up from the cheap plastic pads. Great sensitivity, very stable. My only problem with this product is that the arrows cracked the second day I had the pad. I'm a excessive DDR player, playing at least an hour and a half a day. I was expecting the arrows to crack at some point, but not two days in. I'm really glad I bought this product. But if you play as much as I do I recommend that you just save up for a full metal pad, so you don't have to deal with cracking."
1,Do NOT waste money on this product.,"I could literally feel the pad breaking under my feet as I played, and it did not even last through one session of play. If you are looking for a good pad to play at home with, a cobalt flux is your best bet."
3,this is so wonderful,Pas de Tot is so fun and I love it. It means step of the tot. The tot means little child. I was dancer in New York city. I am back now after a while. A little while.
2,flawed design,works great if (a) you don't mind having to look down every time you want to click because the buttons are so small you can't keep your finger on them and (b) you don't mind your audience hearing an annoyingly loud click every time you advance the slide.
2,Emotionless,"Perhaps I am too American for this particular production, but it was boring. I was really expecting great things considering the cast, but it was flat. Even I, a Shakespeare buff & English teacher, was bored beyond redemption less than halfway through it. I was hoping to replace the Zefferelli version with this one in my classroom, but there's no way modern teens would stay attentive."
4,A Bargain,I have bought other geneaolgy programs only to return them. This program beats them all and for the price it is half of what other software programs cost. I find it simple to use with nformation stored without complications. It works well with Windows XP. I enjoy scanning documents and pictures as well and storing them to the desired individual in my geneaolgy program. There are no bothersome advertisements endorsements. I would give it five stars if there were better directions how to operate the program. If you have some computer savy you can figure how to operate the system. It is an excellent program and definitely worth the proce.
2,Family Tree Program,"This program was ok, nothing special really. It stored the information but when I wanted a printout of different family tree formats the layouts and what came out were really bad. It was even bad to try to view the formats. If you want a program that you can work with easily and not do anything with the informatioin than go for it but if you want a program where you can actually do stuff then find something else because this is not the right program."
1,Family Tree Quick & Easy,"Don't be fooled by the name of this program. Entering the information was fairly easy but the report function were anything but quick and easy. I had to call tech support 2 times, holding more than 10 minutes each time, only to find out that printing my entire family tree was not possible."
1,Would be better if it worked...,"After each race, the game crashes. I updated all of my drivers which didn't stop the problem from occuring. I have plenty of memory so that's not the problem either. Another thing, this game does not come with a manual not even a booklet to help with troubleshooting. Oh, it has a 1 1/2 page pdf document on the disc which was no help at all. If you are not going to provide any documentation then it should be sold as a jewel case for half the price. This was indeed a very disappointing purchase because it promises so much but fails to deliver. There are no patches available either. Not cool!"
5,Trucker,This was a christmas gift for one of my sons. He loves the computer truck driving games so I ordered it for my daughter-in-law to give to him. He loves it!! We ended up ordering 3 different games for his laptop. Yeah for Amazon!!
4,A refreshing and amusing pleasure to read!,"This book plays tremendously on personal experience, refering to instances so many people could relate to. The reality of ""Mr Commitment"" makes the humour, makes the frustration, makes the charm, makes it work!The Duffy (Mr Commitment himself!) whom we meet at the beginning of the novel encapsulates the frustration, and yet the charm, suffered by every girl in love with a man terrified of committing himself. The accuracy of the character portrayal makes the humour of the work that much more acute, whilst Mike Gayle's insights into human relationships provide stimulating food for thought, alongside the gradual maturity and development of Duffy as the novel progresses. Experience reconciles him with his true desires and teaches him the value of what he could lose in a light and softly philosophical way. A refreshingly male perspective after the ""Bridget Jones"" trend and a genuine pleasure to read."
2,No Nick Hornby,"I put this book away a dozen times during the first 100 pages because it was iritatingly predictable and I found everything ordinary. Worst of all, as ordinary as it was, it was still hard to believe some parts and dialogue. Unfortunately, I was on a long road trip and this book was all I had. So I trudged forward and found a couple interesting scenes (Meena's wedding) but was happy to finish the book and be done with it.I bought the book because people compared it to Hornby's High Fidelity. I've read High Fidelity and About a Boy from Hornby and I can tell you that this book isn't worthy of the comparison."
5,A very cute ... and VERY FUNNY book !,"I just finished this book today, and I have already told everyone I met how funny this book is. You would have guessed from the title that it is about a relationship ... the relationship of Mel & Duffy through the eyes of Duffy ... I found it very interesting to see the point of view of Duffy about his relationship ... there is a certain innocence in him (that I think we find in every man) which makes even the most normal scenes very funny ...(loved it when he describes the day at IKEA with Mel)I laughed throughout the whole book ...In the same category there is 'Junk Mail', very funny as well"
5,"FAST, FUNNY AND REMARKABLY WARMING READ!",This was one of my favorite books all year. The main character's turbulations in finding the meaning of commitment is remarkably true to what happens in life. I found it very warming and at some parts I found myself laughing out loud! Highly recommended
4,"enjoyable for all, but esp. interesting for a niche market","Fascinating read for a woman curious to look into the mind of her reluctant-to-commit man-- and humorous and uplifiting to boot.enjoyable, fast read. pretty british."
2,Mr. Completely and Totally Predictable!,"Every single plot twist was visible from approximately two million light years away. This book was utterly and totally devoid of any original sentiment or new thought. Why am I giving in two stars instead of one, then? Well, it did only take me two hours to get through it.I liked this book a lot better when it was called High Fidelity, and when it was actually funny."
3,Committed and did not know it !,"This is a story of a young man ( Duffy) afraid of commitment ! A young twenty eight year old guying dating a young lady for 4years and finding himself afraid to commit ! I felt Duffy truely loved Mel, she was his best friend ( he could talk to her about anything ) so what was the problem with marrying her ! When Mel decides to pop the question to him after 4 years he agrees but not wholeheartedly ! She realizes he is not really ready so she decides to break the relationship off ! He soon learns and realizes there is no one else like Mel. He was already commited and didn't even realize it ! This was an emotional story at times ! While I rated it with 3* it actually was a 3.5 rating !"
5,Laughed and Cried!,I loved Mr. Commitment! While reading the first chapter I caught myself laughing outloud. It was easy to see myself in the words Mike Gayle had written and easier to see my boyfriend (of 5 years) as Duffy. I have read portions of this book aloud to my boyfriend and it has helped us talk about our relationship. For hopeless romantics this is a must read!
1,Weak,Looks like these guys got their first video camera and tried to make a movie. The whole black and white imagery and very long drawn boring scenes forced me to cut it off in 17 minutes.
2,Made In China,"After you wind it up, it moves... a little. It doesn't work very well. But I'm guessing people won't buy this with the intent of marching it around the block. If you plan to let it sit on a shelf, it's great."
2,Not a good robot,"I bought this toy for son since he loves tin and wind up robots which are hard to find. This one is cute and small so he can lug it around but the seperate key does not work at all on this robot so we couldn't make him walk and though his arms can be moved, I snapped them off trying to move then in a different position right off the bat. My son was hysterial so we had to super glue them on (so much for being able to return the toy). I read collectible toy on the box after I bought the toy, my son is gentle with his toys, but I expected a sturdier, working toy for $9.99 plus shipping. I am very, very disappointed. Do not buy!"
4,Cool for the shelf,This is a cool toy for sitting on the shelf. It looks like a collectors item. Really quite simple in terms of mechanics. Not for little people.
5,The Stuff Legends Are Made Of,"That's what Herbert von Karajan had. On this CD, you get Dvorak's 8th Symphony, Tchaikovsky's 4th Symphony, Bach's Violin Concerto, and opera highlights of Mozart and Bizet. Truly it is an artist's palette of music. This compilation, I am sure, aims at showing the true flexibility of Karajan as a conductor. He was just at home with baroque as he was the ultra romanticism of Tchaikovsky as well, he was the consummate opera conductor. Although, the opera cast in the recordings on this compilation aren't top notch, the music is what is important, and Karajan delivers."
3,Vapid,"This debate had almost no life in it. I just don't see that much interaction between the three authors. Also, the fact that there were only three authors is problematic. Not having separate sections for Historic and Dispensational Premillenialism will certainly effect a work like this negatively. To have a Dispensationalist speak for an Historic Premillenialist ir vice versa will leave one of the views with poor representation because the presenter has no vested interst in that viewpoint (and is in fact an opponent, causing their presentation to intentionally be weak). This is certainly not the book that you want to use in a discipleship group or study. THe presentations are too weak. The way that each author approaches the discussion is far from forceful, which I feel it should be. I would suggest Meaning of the Millenium instead. But I could be wrong since there are people who've rated this work higher than the four-point. So check it out if you'd like."
4,Paul Doherty Keeps Pulling Them Out of the Hat,"The year is 1303 and the monks of the Benedictine Abbey of St. Martin's are happy with their quiet and peaceful existence, but all this changes when their Abbot is found brutally murdered in his own room. The Abbot is an old friend of King Edward I, and it is not long before Sir Hugh Corbett, the Keeper of the King's Seal arrives to investigate the murder.As the death toll begins to rise Corbett sets about investigating the dark secrets that the Abbey holds.Paul Doherty just keeps coming up with exciting new plots. He is a very prolific author and one tends to think in these cases that the books are just pulp fiction, but in fact his plots and characters are well thought and and well chosen. More power to your pen . . .typewriter . . . word processor Paul."
4,A great mystery!,"A great book! I was inspired to read this, having visited Canterbury and a nearby abbey (which once served as a palace for one of Henry VIII's wives) and I've wanted to learn more since. This book, set in an Abbey, lays out several murders for the reader. The King's clerk, Hugh Corbett, is a great character though probably more developed in previous mysteries by the author.This one had me hooked by the time I was halfway through it and I just had to finish it. Even though I like guessing at the ending I was 100% on this one (not even 50%!) but I loved it."
2,"Educational, but not captivating","I bought this DVD for my 2 1/2 year old niece (which may have been too young of an age). I tried to watch it with her, but she didn't seem to be interested in it. It does a great job of showing people doing things and interacting with things while saying the French words, but nothing actually happens. It's just a video montage with no story and no real reason to keep watching.I'm sure your toddler could learn some French from it, but only if you can get them to enjoy and pay attention to it!"
5,Great sound Great features,I debated between this one and the kenwood. I read some reviews about the software on the kenwood having problems so I bought the audiovox. This thing does everything it's supposed to. The sound is cd quality and it comes with everything you need. Including the antenna with 20 feet of cord. The read out is very easy to read. My husband and I absolutely love it and recommend the audiovox to everyone.
2,More of the same of the first one,"I had read the first volume and found it and the author a bit too self-referencing. Still, there were some good insights and wading through it was interesting, if only to get inside another art teacher's mind. But I am not finding the same value as I did in the first book, finding it more of the same for the most part. Sorry; I think the material covered could have been done in much fewer words."
4,A Proven Drawing System,The single lmost important idea this author imparts is that drawing can be learned by anyone willing to commit to a system of exercises that support observation and practice. Many examples show documented development and there is an openness to all forms of individual creative expression.
2,Taken in,"I have read many detective, mystery, and police procedurals from classics to trash. This is in the middle of the spectrum. It's OK, mildly entertaining, contains no real procedural suspense. The subject is the death of a male model and focuses on the fashion world. The only detail concerns what everyone is wearing. Makes a point of being blase at a raft of gay characters. I bought it because of past success from St. Martin's press. They should have left this one for the trade/genre paperbacks. I would have liked it better [on a] ... sale table."
2,Not Head over heels on this one,The relationship between Paul and Ben was very undeveloped so not feelings during the last chapter of the book. Their was to many names to keep up with as to who was who.I liked the concept and some of the characters but they were not developed enough for me to feel for them.It is ok but I have read much better books.
1,REAL RATING IS -----*: THIS IS NOT BOB SEGER,"Amazon requires that when you rate a product that you enter atleast one star. The true rating is of this CD is minus (-) *****stars.Anyone who is looking for Bob Seger needs to look elsewhere! The CD is simply ""The Bob Seger System"" remixed to make it sound more up to date.It also lacks one other key element;BOB SEGER. If this is actually Seger on the CD, then someone does not how to produce an album because his voice is pushed to the background by the music and the ""background vocals"".The mix tells me that Seger's voice is not on the CD, rather a poor substitute."
1,This is a bad album,"They overdubbed his incredible debut album with all sorts of guitars & other trash that shouldn't be there. If you are a true Bob Seger fan you should get this album right away so that you can be as enraged as I am. This sort of thing shouldn't happen. We should all write to Capitol Records & plead with them to re-release his debut album in it's entirety, unscathed. So that we as fans don't have to resort to buying this filth."
1,WOOF this album is no good,"Overdubbed so much it hurts your ears. It would be better if fans was given the chance to get the original albums rereleased on cd, instead of this respectless crab. I wonder if Mr. Seger himself heard this. Do not buy this album."
5,the best,"Just finished this-it's wonderful. It even makes me want to try cigarettes! As stated above, the author's fairly neutral, and the work of the tobacco industry in making and marketing the product really is the most interesting part of the book---the anti-smoking effort and the researches into tobacco are predictably flat and boring (but this is because we already know smoking is bad for you!)."
4,Y'all said it: good but loooooong,"Kluger's research is impressively thorough, his writing is lucid, and his insights -- well, insightful. But his inability to leave any detail unexamined makes this more of a resource book than a narrative. Slogging through to the end, became a chore. I mean, there ARE a few other books I'd like to get to before I die . . ."
3,"Interesting, but too long, too long, too long ...","Author Kluger did a fine job of exhaustively reviewing the tobacco saga, but only through the early-90's. Unfortunately, he stopped just before things got interesting. The book entirely misses the recent revolution against the tobacco lords. Besides, the book is way too long, and basically too complex to read. It's more like an encyclopedia."
3,"Informative, but BLAH","I had to read this for a course I took in college called Science as a Cultural Force: The Tobacco Wars. It was a combination of philosophy and chemistry, and I must say that I found the chemistry and philosophy parts of the course fascinating...but this book left me falling asleep on my bunk bed."
4,Fascinating but where was the editing?,"There is no question but that the book was exhaustively researched and tells you everything you might want to know about the tobacco industry over the past 100 years. Often it was compelling reading as well. But it seems to me it could have been a good deal shorter and still have gotten the main points across--say under 450 pages rather than 750 pages. It seems that every fact Kluger ever uncovered went into this book. As a general matter, I also found the book much more interesting when it was talking about the ""bad guys"" (i.e. the tobacco industry and particularly their advertisers), rather than the efforts of the various anti-tobacco groups to show the harmful effects of smoking. I found those sections comparatively tedious. No question that the book is quite an accomplishment though and I would certainly recommend it although I didn't find it necessary to digest every word"
5,One of the most thorough and best books on the tobacco ind.,"This book is a masterpiece by Dick Kluger. It covers every aspect of the tobacco industry. FromNewport to the Native-Americans. It was enjoyable, well written, informative and objective. Despite the current climate of anti-smoking, Kluger takes a neutral; he wasn't a shill for Philip Morris and he wasn't a shill form Willaim Novilli and the rest of the anti-tobacco crazys. After you read this book, you will know everything that there is to know about tobacco and cigarettes. He fulfils everything that was promised in the sub-title: Americas hundred year cigarette war - check. The Public Health- check. The unabashed trimph of Philip Morris double-check. I couldn't put this book down. You think that this book is only a few pages- despite it's 800 pages. It is fast reading. And it will be one of the best books you'll ever read!"
4,"Long, but good","I'm not a smoker (fortunately my parents totally discouraged me from it, and I had enough smarts to avoid it anyway) but I found this history of the cigarette industry to be quite interesting--especially the facts about the early years.It got a little dry towards the end, and the whole indictment of the industry has gotten a bit repetitious; I suspect at the time the book was published the message was new, but the message has gotten old fast. (Yes, it's clear that they knew about the health issues, and yes, they did very little about it.)Overall it's a good read, especially the first half. If you're at all curious about how the cigarette industry came to be, the book does a great job of describing the companies and personalities involved."
2,"Good Ideas, terribly executed","Crass is a band i wish i could like, but i just can't. The band had some great political ideas, but their lack of ANY musical ability whatsoever ruins any possibility of a promising record. The only reason i give this record 2 stars is for some of their political philosophies, i.e. their disgust at government and the system. Despite this, crass can't play a note to save their lives, and listening to this is unbearable. Also, their negative attitude towards bringing about change(singing that they would never change the system) is rediculous, because thats what they were supposed to be fighting for! How can you accomplish something when you don't believe you will? A dissatisfaction with government is not enough to make me like Crass."
1,This cd is horrible,"Any band who disrespects the clash clearly has no idea what they are talking about. You can say that crass was ""more hardcore"" than the clash, because they were really anarchists, but that just shows how stupid these people were. Anarchism does not work as a political or social structure. Believing in anarchism is just a sign of immature problems with authority. Maybe these guys parents never let them watch tv after 9 oclock or something. The Clash makes better music. They are better songwriters. They are intelligent enough to branch out and experience other styles of music other than what the mohawk-wearing ""non-sellout"" punks would call ""real punk"". Anyway, Crass is horrible, their lyrics are just angry tyrades against authority and those around them who are more successfull and skillfull (the Clash). Buy this record if you want people to think you are a real hardcore ""punk"". What a crock."
5,THE BEGINNING OF CRUST !!!,"The best of all of Crass'albums-and the first of em all,for all of you who don't know.The drumming is incredible,the singing-more of a statement delivery,really-is unique and really nails you to the chair,while the music is weird and pogoing,the drumming is a unique "" military style"" like,the songs are full of samples-tape loops really-lots of guitar feedback and radio sampling-not in the Ramones'fashion though.This and Best Before are punker's favorites.You have to read from the lyric sheet while listening,otherwise you loose 90 % of theimpacts,coz lyrics is all this band's about,and that's no small accomplishment.You'll love every single second of this record,no damned fillers in here.32 minutes of the most exciting,powerful and never succesfully imitated anarcho-political PUNK ROCK.NUFF SAID !!!"
4,BEST AND FIRST,"This release (originally formatted on vinyl, thank you) was intended to only sell a maximum of 5000 copies, hence the title. Unspoken of in the music press, however is the fact that it was near 1,000,000 copies at last count a few years back. This first release by CRASS is my favorite by far. Two versions of the song ""Do they owe us a living"" are on this cd. If you like anything by crass, then you'll like this release.If you've never heard them before, then you are really missing out on some great British anrchist/peace punk.Simplistic form of music- not poppy skate punk and no emopunk lead guitar solos here- and biting hard comentaries on the state of affairs in late 70's/early 80's England. Alot of the ideas have been passed on to later punk bands on both sides of the atlantic lake. With out exception, Dead Kennedys, Circle Jerks, and Propagandhi (as well as many others) got a lot of their influence through these guys."
5,CRASS = Great Punk Band,"all i have to say is that crass is a really great band, especially for the time period in which this album was released. My Favorite song is ""They've Got a Bomb"" and ""Banned From The Roxy""."
4,Won't be hearing this on the radio,"Crass is a fantastic band with a strong message. One star off for being a bit ""crap"" when it comes to music, but thats not what crust punk is about. Its very creative and the distorted sampling on a few tracks to me as an industrial fan is really neat. They're crude and straight forward and thats what what I really like about them. Anyone who liked this should really check out Penis Envy."
5,yes sir i will,"mostly disliked by most politicions,and most other members of public,however,the harsh lyrics and tunes,it is a great political cd,lp or tape. The live cd of their last gig(miners benifit gig) is a great consolation for some of the song,like the much disputed song=sheep farming in the falklands. -"
4,the prodigal son (daughter?),"I was given a tape of this album back in 1990, which was already years after it was released on vinyl. I FELL IN LOVE with this album, but of course my freak mother called it satanic and I had to get rid of it. I had secretly taped it on another tape and that somehow later on as my musical taste shifted it was taped over...years later I was listening to this taped tape and heard about 25 seconds of ""do they owe us a living"" and remembered that I LOVED that song, but couldn't quite remember who it was by, thinking it might be crass I found a couple MP3s online and guess what I heard! My beloved song once again, now I've found it again after nearly 10 years and well I still love it and I'm so glad it's now on CD!"
4,Good Punk CD.,"All I really have to say to those who are thinkng about buying this good, but very hatful punk ablem is that if you just made a transition into the punk rock genre, and used to be into the terrible world of mainstream music then this still might not be for you. Long time, hardcore punk fans only. Also pick up Christ the Albem if you liked this alot."
4,Great Headset,I ordered this headset for my at-home business! It gives me clear sound and LOVE the flexibility of being able to be mobile from room to room and still answer my calls! Super Fast Shipping!! THANKS!
3,"better than Norris, but never quite making the point","I like this author's writing better than Kathleen Norris. Unfortunately, her book never really gets to the point. She talks with each sister, but sums it all up in a paragraph or two. She never really describes their life in the cloister. Although perhaps the point is that she's never allowed in close enough to find out what their daily life is like. Throughout the entire book, one reads as if to discover some compelling mystery or truth, but it's just never quite there.This author is a bit less self-absorbed than Norris; still, this book leaves a lot unwritten. It's almost as if she keeps writing her way around some huge cavern that she wants to reveal but doesn't quite know how.Best to get it from the library if you're interested in reading it."
2,Don't love it as much,"I can see how this book might apeal to some, but I found it far from a ""spiritual classic."" While touching in many ways, the author kept throughout a sort of superior tone that began to grate, as if she was amused at everything she saw and heard. I think she was trying to be witty, but it often came off, at least to me, as a little snotty. But the book has its moments."
1,Bland with a capital B,"This recording made me not like Scriabin at first. Try the Hamelin(for the set) or Richter, Sofronitsky and Horowitz for individual selections."
1,"I DID NOT like this book in any way, shape, or form!",The books content was far from mental health in dealing with the subject of UFO's. The tilte was deceiving to the subject matter within. The book was very hard to follow or understand in the way it was presented. I certainly hope his next attempt will be a vast improvement.
4,A meeting of sound minds and prophetic voices.,"This book is a collection of essays from _Journal for Preachers_ written by some of the most prominent preacher/theologians in America today. Barbara Brown Taylor, William Willimon, Stanley Hauerwas, and Walter Brueggemann all speak to the question of how the church may properly speak in a post-Christian culture. The value of the book comes from both the rigor with which many of the writers engage the biblical text (e.g. Brueggemann) and the artful way the writers manifest the ""hows"" of preaching the gospel to a culture where the church is increasingly thrust to the margins (e.g. Brown Taylor and Willimon). Brown Taylor's ""Preaching the Terrors"" and Willimon's ""Postmodern Preaching"" stand out from the rest of the essays, but one will not be disappointed by any of the authors."
4,Very Good,"Pros:* good looks* good quality fit and finish* good picture both via cable TV and PC (1024x768), even with over-the-air reception* surprisingly good sound quality* good remote functionsCons:* OPC feature"
5,Rupp never had a losing record at UK . . .,"The Kiwi is quite mistaken in his reference to Rupp's ""losing seasons"". The Baron's worst record at UK was 15-10 in 1964. Dave Kindred (formerly of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Louisville Courier Journal and others) was neither a lover of UK nor Rupp and he stated that Rupp never gave the quote that our New Zealand friend attributes to Adolph. ""Can't we all just get along?"""
5,TONY NAVAJAS,THE B BOY CD OF ALL TIME PUERTOROCKS ON DA MOON RIGHT NOW KEEP IT ON TOP.....................ADR.................AIME UTI AMBUSH
5,Great charger,I am so very glad I had bought this charger for my cam. It is so easy and simple to use and there are two different ways to use it. I LOVE IT.
5,a classic,"Classic. Mythologies are metaphors, usually about spiritual practices. Neville Goddard has some nice metaphorical meanings for Biblical stories, and mythology also has similar meanings. For example, Prometheus and Epimetheus are going forward and backward on one's timeline. One can go forward on one's timeline, to the light, and bring it back, just as Prometheus did, and as is noted in Tad James'The Secret of Creating Your Future. Bullfinch did a great job of collecting these."
3,alright,"it's a bit dull, good reading when you want to fall asleep- epic tales i agree, but the old classics have a way of bleeding together-with ridiculous endless wars, horny rampaging deities, and names i don't know who can pronounce."
3,Soso,"Fabulous, great reference but wouldn't read it otherwise it was so so it was not my favorite book ever ."
2,Awful Edition of Bulfinch's Mythology,"Bulfinch's Mythology as long been one of my favorite collections of myth. However, this edition from Seven Treasures Publications (ISBN 978-1440426308) is AWFUL! It looks like it was formatted with Microsoft Word by someone who has no business with such tasks. The print is cramped and the page header and footer is barely set off of the page type. The Glossary was not professionally edited and pales in quality compared to the Avenal Edition of Bulfinch's Mythology.Buy the title, just not this edition! Two thumbs down!"
4,Mythology in its storybook version,"This a great book for all who have a intrest in hearing the myths and legends of gods and heroes, just in their story form, without it being analytical or narrated as a deconstructed text. This is mythology in its purest form, before it's been tampered with by english professors or translated by the historyian.A great read of the ancient myths."
3,Well written but a bit loosely.,"A classic reference used by millions of laypeople the world around. The stories are retold in an engaging fashion, capturing the imagination of the reader. However, for the serious scholar the lack of citations and the rather loose interpretation at times, will be a problem. Don't let this be the only reference on mythology if you are teaching a class."
4,Excellent Reference,"The key is recognizing that this is more of a reference book rather than something that might be read through straight for enjoyment. I think many of the other reviews recognize that as well. This book is very useful in our home school. We have a classical leaning in our home school and that means studying Greek and Latin and even the role of Gods and Mythology in ancient history. I also have a son that likes to learn about the myths and the ancient Gods and Goddesses. This is the book we often turn to for more information.For being on the kindle and being free, its an excellent book for a great price. We are not sorry to have it in our library."
3,Mediocre,"this was not as ""entertaining"" as I thought it would be. It was just a lot of facts. Each passage was not described as well. I thought it would be a lot of short stories, but it did not come across as that."
2,too hard to get into...,I haven't finished this book yet because it is hard to get into and doesn't hold my attention. Not sure if I will be able to finish it or not.
2,This version of Bulfinch...,"I have a book of Bulfinch's Mythology but got this Kindle edition for convenience sake. I have read quite a bit of the original book and was reading the introduction of the Kindle edition and the introduction was nothing like the original introduction. I went up a few pages and this version is revised by a Rev. E. E. Hale. It is a major revision, I would say rewrite with Hale's own opinion of things. I have not gotten into the meat of the book yet to see the differences but I was disappointed because I really liked Bulfinch's introduction and believe it is far, far superior to the rewrite. It would be nice if Amazon could let us know if it is a revision or an abridgment but it's not that big of a deal considering that it is free."
1,This OCR Edition is Terrible,"The General Books 2010 edition, sold for more than $20, comes with this disclaimer ""This is an OCR edition without illustrations or index. It may have numerous typos or missing text."" And indeed it is riddled with errors, distorted names, and mangled formatting, which combine to give a horrible reading experience.Amazon shouldn't even list it alongside other, non-OCR versions of Bulfinch's Mythology. Since reviews are shared among editions, one doesn't get the proper impression that what you're buying is substandard."
5,Bulfinch's Mythology,"I was very happy with the book I received. I received it in about 5 days after I ordered it, it was in good shape and exactly what I needed."
2,Disappointing,"- Subject: fascinating- Author's writing style: disjointed and self-focused anecdotes- Tone of writing: whiny- Wanted to put it down after 20 pages.- Despite effort to get through it, did put it down about halfway through."
2,"interesting story, mediocre storytelling","Ms. Casey is a fine, if unspectacular writer. Her story is interesting, and i was fascinated by a lot of the things I learned about white sharks. It's unfortunate that she didn't get to experience more first-hand encounters with them, and I hope that she writes again about white sharks.I also hope that she never, ever reads for her own audiobook again. She has a pathetically monotone voice, with a distinct lack of verve and character. You would think that someone speaking the words that they wrote would imbue them with emotion and feeling, making the listener feel privileged to hear the story from the source. Not in this case. Her dramatic pauses lack drama, her wisecracks fall flat, and her hopes and fears come across as bland and faceless."
2,The Devil Wears Patagonia,"Here's the story. Privileged yuppie teams up with seemingly misanthropic scientists to observe white sharks and condescend to everyone else. Entertaining but not educational, we learn more about the scientist's ""rugged, good looks"" than their credentials. The author is the type of wanna-be most of us know. ""If I sleep with a scientist that sort of makes me a scientist too,"" is what they think. But she's neither biologist nor historian, although I am sure she knows the complete history of Birkin bags."
2,Book starts off about Magnificant Creatures ends up about author,"I have to say, being an environmentalist, and being obsessed with sharks, drew me to this book. Let me keep it simple for you. The book starts off about the Scientists, the individual Great White Sharks, and the Island, and ends about all about the author, who quite frankly I had no interest in. It should be called ""I tried to write about the sharks, I really tried, but in the end it is about me"".:("
1,I was nonplussed,"I wasn't really too impressed with this book. I was hoping to hear lots of interesting shark stories, but it turned out to be more about the author's personal tragedies. Although it was a very easy, almost childish read, I had a hard time getting through the book because there was an excess of boring passages about nothing in particular. I was disappointed."
5,The female Krakauer,"It's probably not fair to call Susan Casey ""the female Jon Krakauer,"" but I kept thinking as I read this book of how much the two authors are alike: they plunge fearlessly into a place most people won't go and give expansive, fascinating backgrounds, all while keeping the story genuine. Once I picked up the book, I couldn't put it down. I never knew those tiny romantic-seeming little islands just west of San Francisco were so frightening and awful, nor did I know how huge white sharks can be, lurking and boiling too close for comfort. There's a point early in the story where Casey admits she has sharks on the brain and can't wait to get back to the terrible conditions of the island. After reading this book, you'll find sharks on the brain, too."
4,Thrilled and chilled,"What a magnificent beast the Great White Shark is and what powerful descriptions from this author. This work is a thorough examination of the thrilling research into the lives of the White Sharks of the offshore West Coast. The photographs are thrilling and really add to the narrative and the information.I felt a little guilty when Susan Casey's enthusiasms cost the key researcher his job - a loss for both his department and, I suspect the sharks."
2,diary of a vapid B,"OK, so the book starts out fine with some cool history of both the islands and early days in SF. As a resident here for 30 years I found the research and writing informative and well executed. UNFORTUNATELY she digresses to self indulgence, revealing both her lack of restraint and a penchant for poor taste in the following: ""Each time I visited the Farallones . . .Even when I didn't get to shower for a week I always felt sexier than I'd ever felt walking around Manhattan all cleaned up and wearing Gucci heals or La Perla underpants"". You've got to be kidding. The book is full of details of little relevance. She manages to find space to recount her pull-up exploits, how stylish and cool the scientists are, and describes her time moored off the island as if she survived the ""perfect Storm"". I found myself hoping she'd slip into the water and get munched by one of the ""Sisters""."
4,Superb,"More about the adventures of the author on these forboding islands than it is about great whites, it's still an engrossing read. One of the best I've read in a long time. Sometimes when you can't get away for an ""adventure"", a book like this comes along and puts you in someone else's. I walk away refreshed, ready to face the world again, with new respect for great white sharks, the Faralones, and especially the author and the researchers on the island. Thanks for taking me along."
4,"A great tale of an island adventure, not much detail about shark science","Susan Casey, a journalist, becomes intrigued by white sharks and the Farallon Islands some thirty miles from San Francisco. After fighting through restrictions and barriers, she manages to get onto the island and observe a group of scientists studying predation by great white sharks within the so-called red triangle. Her description of the islands flora and fauna are very good. Detailed descriptions of shark attacks also give the story some excitement. She doesn't provide much scientific detail about the research she observed; however, she's a journalist, not a biologist. She's a story-teller and does a good job.If your a shark junkie who enjoys scientific detail about the behavior and biology of sharks, you'll most certainly be disappointed. On the other hand, if you enjoy tales of natural adventures and the hardships endured along the way, you'll be entertained."
4,An exciting story,"This was a very exciting story. Susan Casey writes well, giving us an inside view of the events in a natural prose style. The Farallons never seemed so close, even when I visited San Francisco and toured them by boat. Casey writes a compelling story of the scientists and naturalists living in hellish conditions because they love the sharks, their--to my mind--unusual behavior, individually and in groups. Who knew sharks had such personalities? My only wish is that she'd concentrated more on the sharks, kept the whole sailboat incident out of it, and I couldn't read about Peter losing his job--his life up to this point!--without a little anger. It's a very quick read and worth it if you like sharks and roughing it."
4,Great book - but the title needs a rework,"I'm fine with the ""Devil's Teeth"" part, which is explained in the book, but the subtitle about ""Obsession and Survival Among America's Great White Sharks"" *HAS* to be changed. I really did like this book, for many reasons, but the book is more about the characters who live and work on the Farallon Islands than about sharks, bottom line.I bought this book to read about sharks, specifically great white sharks. I don't care about the migratory patterns of Puffins - and am still unsure why so much time, in a book about sharks, was spent talking about birds and such. The only explanation is that this book is not about sharks, but about the Farallon Islands, its rich and wild history, and the people who have chosen to spend significant portions of their life on the rocks."
4,"Great sharks, bad boats","This is a very interesting and entertaining book. Particularly the first half, discussing the biology of great white sharks, reasearch at the Farallon Islands, and the history of the Farallones. The end of the book shifts to a personal account of the author's attempts at staying at the Farallones without formal permission...while this part is still interesting, it doesn't compare to the excitement and fascinating natural history of the first half. Still, a great read."
2,Thoughtless introspection,"I listened to the tape version of this book on a 14 hour cross-country drive. I persevered, but, by tape six, I was weary of the author's ""sharky dreams"", her ouija board and her whining about the conditions under which she was living. For example, in the first couple of chapters, she repeatedly outlines the harsh conditions of the waters surrouding the islands. In her zeal to return to the islands ""under the radar,"" she docks a boat in what will prove to be overwhelming conditions. What did she expect?The material was probably enough for a couple of good magazine articles. As a book, it could have used a good copy editor to whittle it down to a reasonably focused narative."
2,Sharks? What Sharks?,The book starts out promising insight into white sharks and the Farallones but ends up being all about Ms. Casey. She comes across as a dangerous dabbler who left considerable damage in her wake. The story was superficial and disappointing.
4,I liked the information on Sharks,"My sister read this book. I have been curious about sharks, so was a good read.I enjoyed the information on the sharks, but didn't care for the background story."
1,Don't Bother,The author and her persistence to observe activities on the island leads the the demise of the entire shark research project. great.
5,History Made Fun,"A great read! Never a dull moment- this book is laced with intesting facts, history and comedy."
2,I came away disappointed in the end...,"Susan Casey's book is a fascinating peek into her obsession with white sharks. Her fascination and admiration of the creatures comes through, as does the passion behind her personal quest to spend time on the Farallones. However, by the end of the book, I was angry with Casey. Her blind passion put the entire Sharkwatch operation in jeopardy and resulted in the firing of one valuable researcher. I think that she succeeds in translating the majesty and awe of the white shark, but I think that the story comes off as a selfish city reporter who is no better than the tourists (whom she criticizes) who pay to cage dive with the sharks. She may mean to do well, but leaves the project in jeopardy as a direct result of her irresponsible actions."
3,"Some good, some bad.","Many of the criticisms already mentioned in other reviews are valid, so I won't repeat them. That being said, it is a book about an interesting place and subject, and while I was a bit disapointed by the self-centered writing of the author I just can't bring myself to give it less than three stars."
3,"Interesting story, but.","It was interesting to read the history of the Farallones, having lived in the Bay Area myself for many years. Susan Casey is a good story-teller, capable of creating scenes we could easily visualize, feel and even smell. As the main character in the story, my take-away was that she was a pretty girl who persuaded people to do things that went against their better judgment, because she was a persuasive, pretty girl, and in so doing created a fair measure of grief and destruction in people's lives. As in: this is something I want, regardless of how it may impact the lives of those around me."
5,great book,"excellent book! fascinating details about the great whites and the island. if you are looking for a nicely written book, this one rocks the boat"
2,The Devil's Teeth,"My thought after reading this book was "" I wish I could get my money back."" I didn't like it at all. It had less to do with sharks and more to do with Susan's plights on the island itself.I found the most interesting part the history of the island itself. The shark parts were not that great and actually take a second seat to her stay on the island. She does illustrate that each shark in itself is a unique animal with personality. If you like this kind of drivel you might like the book. But if your looking for hardcore shark data, biological data you will be disappointed."
2,"Blue Water, White Noise","Good geography book. Glad someone was able to get out there and pseudo-report on the importance of the research going on. Reads like a long article from an outdoor mag. Definitely an experiential book. Not a lot of hard numbers on anything of importance if you're interested in whites considering her hosts, but the Farallon history is right thorough. Unfortunately, the sharks didn't carry the book, allowing a decent writer the opportunity to write about topics that were slightly more interesting than watching grass grow. The efforts going on out there could have used better than this. Great subject, wrong writer."
2,Bimbo on safari,"Anyone who can buy a Ouija board to take on what should have been the adventure of a lifetime, pay $160 for it and then admit it has to be a complete bimbo.I enjoyed some of the writing about the history of the island, the birds and the sharks. But there's no real substance to the book and no point either - other than to document the author's self-indulgence.Overall, this was a disappointment."
1,Misleading Title,"I bought this book because the title suggested it would be about sharks; I found instead a 200+ page babble on a rocky island, birds and biologists with attitude problems (for example, only 7 out of 37 color photographs showed a shark from above the water, the rest showed absolutely uninteresting stuff).This was an absolut [...].Stefan von Brentano"
3,"""Here sharky, sharky""","Take it from someone who's read ravenously much of what's been published, scientific and popular, on the subject of the white shark over the last 30 years - this is a good but not a great book on the subject.In my esteem the best book on white shark safaris is still the first, the great Peter Mathesson's Blue Meridian, which documented Peter Gimbol's expedition to produce the movie Blue Water, White Death, which in turn inspired much of the parody of The Life Aquatic with Steve Zassou. Granted, it's not a book about science - since they did none - but it is a soulful exploration of the eerie place shark's inhabit in our collective unconscious.What I did find unique and valuable about Casey's book is its back story on the history of the Farallones, and I would recommend it more for that than for her lackluster treatment of the sharks, which remain the ocean's greatest enigmas in spite of all our efforts to explicate them."
4,Good read,"I just picked up this book in a discount bookstore in Orlando while on vacation for 4$ not expecting it to be such a great book. While learning about both the animal and natural world, I got to revel in Susan's destruction (of both herself as well as about anything she touched). She is the classic white hunter of years past. In short, it was extreme and I loved it. I recommend folks read it - but only with the attitude of looking for entertainment value."
1,Wow - Is This A Joke?,"Susan Casey - Gonzo journalist you are NOT!It's pretty obvious you want to sleep with a few of the scientists while at the same time, sabotage their entire research program. It's also obvious this tale is not so much about the Great White Shark as it is about YOU. It almost reads like, diary of a WANNA-BE. I like learning about the Great White to, but I wouldn't begin to qualify MYSELF as an expert opinion on the subject, even if I did see one up-close (which I have not). My point - this whole book was a waste of time for those of us who thought you had something thoughtful or educational to say about the Great White Shark."
1,A so-so story that has a few sharks in it,"I was excited to read Devil's Teeth, because who isn't interested in great white sharks? However, what a disappointment this one turned out to be. The background on the Farallones was interesting. But the sharks were minor players in what turned out to be a self-centered tale of a spoiled brat who wanted to get on the islands at any cost. She ruined a scientist's career, lost a 60-foot yacht, and then left everybody else holding the bag. Can't recommend this one."
3,Great topic but self absorbed writer,"Positives: stories about history of the Farallones and too-brief summaries of scientific information about white sharks.Negatives: way, way too much information about her own personal struggles. Also, she seems to semi-idolize the scientists in a way that struck me as groupie-like: ""He was a striking person, in his early thirties and athletically built, with jet-black hair and dark eyes and a smile that could light up a small midwestern city.""The author picked a great subject, and was clearly willing to do whatever it took to get a story, but she would have been better served by focusing more of her attention on the sharks and the islands. Nothing that happened to her personally seemed all that interesting to me."
4,informative but scary,"i took a day trip out to the Farallon Islands and it is other wordily. To endure living a few months there takes dedication. I enjoyed Ms Casey's reportingand it is spot on. While her book The Wave is so much more compelling, this should not be missed. She has guts."
2,Ambivalent,"While I thought the history of the Farrallones was fascinating, the fawning hero worship of Casey over Peter Pyle particularly was annoying. Like other disappointed reviewers I found the actual shark information lacking, although I did enjoy reading about all of the other wildlife on the islands.I really couldn't believe, however, that at the end Casey takes such flaccid ""responsibility"" for the demise of the shark project and the ruination of Pyle's career. I suppose her self-absorption and determination to put her own wants first are what permitted her to have such unprecedented access to a place few are allowed to visit in the first place, so it should be unsurprising that she will accept the accolades and gloss over the damage done by her ""work"" there. I was appalled, and saddened by the obvious and truly devastating impact that her little ""obsession"" had on the project."
2,"Book about writing a book, not about sharks","I purchased the book interested in learning more about great whites and the history of the Farallone Islands. As a surfer in Northern California, I'm fascintated in the topic and thought this would make a readable natural history and well researched book. While the book is very readable, it falls short of being the informative book on sharks and the islands. She is a compelling and good writer and manages to make most of the book about the difficulties she encounters in trying to write the book. The best compliment that I can give her is that she still manages to make this very readable. In actuality she spends almost no time during her limited stint on the islands, with sharks."
4,"Interesting tale about the ocean, sharks, and some drama","I quite enjoyed this book. If you are a diver or someone who loves the ocean you probably will too. Although the author spends a fair bit of time at the end talking about her misadventures, overall I still found it to be an enjoyable read. I knew very little about the Farallon Islands before reading this book even though I am from California. My friend who I gave this book to after reading it also enjoyed it."
3,A glimpse into a world,"I read this book because of the subject matter and while I did enjoy it, it could have been much better. I would recomend this book to people that know nothing about sharks or the islands that are the topic in this book. It is a good introduction into shark conservation. Yet for those that have sharks on the brain mroe than simply catching a BBC doc on the TV it is not as engrossing. It really is her diary as she watched others and doesnt have the same real when compared to books written by people that really know these beautiful creatures."
4,Hole,"Drills holes in wood. They are round and go all the way through to the other side. In place of wood, there is now nothing."
5,Stellar Work...Honestly!,"Great novel. One must keep up with the dates and years and remember what was occuring in history to fully understand and appreciate the intricate web of events. Many family skeletons are pulled from the closet and tossed on the family room floor, and done so is an amazingly graceful manner.This is my favorite modern novel and I compare all others to it. White Lies is, in my opinion, flawless. This was the first of only three novels that I have ever read that moved me to write to the author--and she replied."
5,This book changed my marriage,"My husband and I read this book while on vacation for 5 days in Eureka Springs, AR. Our relationship was bumpy, sexless, and we were both miserable. We may not have been on the verge of divorce but seperation had been mentioned several times. We had just had our second child six monthes before and we were busy with everything else. Reading this book and following the steps led us to a deeper connection than we had ever had before. I reccomend this book to those who may think they have a good marriage becuase things can always be better. Almost four years later,it has given us the tools to connect whenever we find our relationship slipping."
3,A minor curiosity at best...,"Largely clap-trap for people who don't already know about how important intimacy, openness and honesty are to a relationship. The whole book is told as stories of several different couples the authors worked with, which I mostly skipped through. The best part was the chart on chakras, which can be downloaded freely on the internet."
2,There should be more than sex to a relationship,"Ok, I will be fair to say that this book is another sex guide ""researched"" by experts and doesn't proclaim to be anything more. However, acting out fantasies to ensure a fabulous sex life seems to lack two very important factors, emotion and honesty.How many times must we have some experts tell of different environments, positions, etc. before we realize that once the book is finish, the magic will soon extinguish? The problem we have here (to paraphrase a famous movie) is a failure to communicate. Does a person want magnificent sex? Communication and emotions trump any role-play for ""a lifetime"" of compasion.Looking for the magical cure to your boring sex life should start with the dialoge and learning to say ""I love you"" with sincerity rather than pretending to be something you are not."
2,This book is too focused on straight couples!,I thankfully bought it as a gift for a dear straight couple who seemed to like it though. I just didn't
1,Better advice from teenagers,"Holstein has some prurient entertainment value in this book, but the rest of it sounds smug. Her advice is of the I have a good sex life and if you do what I do variety, you will too.In summary, if you just accept your partner, no matter what they've done to themselves or their bodies, you will enjoy your sex life. Come on. Humans are conditioned to find health, fitness, and physical attractiveness as turn-ons, so it seems partners have some responsibility to keep themselves appealing.Finally, the idea that people need to change partners, isn't examined, because in Holstein's world everything can be fixed. Sometimes that is true, but sometimes that is pure nonsense."
1,the no show,"I never recieved my purchase. I also, to the best of my knowledge, have not recieved my refund like I was told I would get."
2,Sorry but Mr PREVIN is quite off the tracks,"He has a beethovenian approach of the score which is quite a contradiction. Broad tempos, large orchestra, big sound.Everything is technically perfect but we are very far from RAVEL. In addition, the french diction of the singers is very poor.What a difference with his EMI recording of the 80's which is a real gem.The reference is obviously Ansermet but let's not forget BOUR (mono sound) & JORDAN (stereo sound)."
3,Ravel - meet Verdi?,"This is NOT a review of the recording - it is a review of the booklet accompanying the CD - nearly every other page of the booklet is the libretto of Verdi's ""Falstaff"" - which means a good chunk of the program notes for the Ravel are NOT included!"
5,A great old classic,I cant believe I was able to find this book in such incredible condition. I bought it to replace one owned by my father in the 1960's and it was just perfect!.
1,Piece of Junk,"DO NOT BUY THIS!! You WILL be disappointed. This is the second one I have owned. The touchscreen failed on the first one after only a few uses. The second one (what was I thinking, buying this junk AGAIN?) was so dim as to be unreadable, even with fresh batteries and the backlite on. My first one didn't have a backlite, but at least I could SEE it.BUYER BEWARE!!"
2,Great idea - bad display.,"When one looks at the box, it appears you're getting an Indiglo back-light. That's not the case. I asked for this for X-mas from my wife. Finally tried to use it on 12/28, but I cannot clearly see the chord diagrams. And, even though I don't play in public (yet), I would find it extremely difficult to use this device in a poorly lit area (as most gigs are). Get a real backlight on this, and I would definately keep it. Unfortunately, this puppy is going back to Guitar Center."
2,Handy but hampered,"As a previous reviewer stated this is a nice handy little chord finder unit to own. Fairly easy to use and the price is right. IMHO, it is better the over complicated Planet Waves GM-II version. Display is still the big problem though. It is hard to read and nearly useless in some lighting conditions. The back light (Indiglo like) version is still dim. A real ""easy to see"" back light would make this item a winner."
4,A beautiful book,"This tikkun is beautiful - it has more than any other tikkun I've ever used - regular Hebrew, Torah script, translation to English, and commentary, all across from each other. Because it has so much, however, it is also double the size of the traditional tikkun, so it's not as portable. It hasn't been a problem for me, because I prepare at home, but be aware, this is a BIG book (same size as the standard tikkun, but double the width).I've prepared two readings from this tikkun so far, and the Torah script looks exactly like the Torah - a very easy transition for me. If the weight of the book doesn't bother you, I'd strongly recommend it."
2,attractive title with little substance,"The title of the book uses the buzz words ""credit risk"" to attract readers. However, the papers collected in the book are not very deep and the coverage is very restricted. There is not much theory offered, nor is there any rigorous empirical work done. Not recommended for purchase, a browse maybe OK."
4,Basic but good.,"I agree with everyone else, but they are comming from a different point of view than the person that would benefit from this book.This book is very nicely done for the beginner who wants to read his first book on credit risk.Even for me I found some information in it that was extremely beneficial; it will probbaly save our corporation a great deal of money."
2,Ray Draper,This is really a collection of very general personal reports on things to consider when designing a scoring system. For practical application I think it has limited scope.
2,A good apologia for FICO,"This book describes how the US mortgage and credit card industries approach modeling, from the industry standard practioners point of view. It is best read by those familiar with the industry. It ignores the potential of current thinking outside industry standard practices. However, everyone interested in the subect needs to know the way FICO does it; they are the standard."
2,Disappointing,Dvorak's symphonies are known for their depth of orchestration. These renditions lack any brilliance or exuberance. They are stodgy and dull. I expected better of the London Sympnony Orchestra.
3,It is not useful as an extension of a charging cable for tablet.,Although it is a very useful and very comfortable device I've noticed that when using it slows the loading of my tablet.
3,Cute,"I admit, I've heard of Carol Channing and I know who she is but I've never seen her in any Broadway shows with that being said ~ and the positive reviews on the cover ~ I looked forward to seeing 'Carol Channing - Larger Than Life'. I only wished there were more interviews involving Carol, the woman can tell fantastic stories all the while, acting out! Overall, I thought it was ok. Carol exudes positive inspiration which I loved to see and the story how she reunited with her current husband was very touching. She's a gem!"
5,Hello Carol!,"What an amazing documentary of an amazing actress! This film follows Carol around as she gets ready to go onstage again after 16 years for an AIDS benefit. Her Dollly 'Boys' are there to help her along and so is a long lost love - just try not tearing up when he talks about how he wanted to come up to her when he saw her outside a theatre and didn't - Carols ""Oh you should have!"" tugs at the heart strings.Still going strong at her age is also a gret example for all of us! As the song saysw ""Look at the old girl now fellas"" and we must!"
5,Carol Channing is delightful in this engaging DVD,Carol Channing is one of the most engaging multi-talented stars in show business. This DVD is very interesting because Carol Channing is a delightful show business icon. You'll enjoy watching and listening to her stories. Other stars also offer wonderful tributes to Ms. Channing. I didn't know a lot about Carol Channing. After seeing this DVD I will seek other DVDs and CDs with Carol Channing. I recommend this DVD highly. You won't be disappointed!
5,Fantastic!!!,"I've always been aware of Carol Channing throughout my adult life, but never really caught her on Broadway or really paid a great deal of attention to her professionally. But after seeing this wonderful documentary I feel the loss was definitely mine. What an amazing woman with an even more amazing story! And the icing on the cake is her relationship to her beloved husband. I'd give this ten stars if I could. I absolutely loved it!!!"

4,Nice Telemann Collection,"This collection of Telemann Concertos and Overtures is an excellent purchase for someone who loves baroque music and is interested in discovering this composer. Conductor Neville Marriner and the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields turn in first rate performances of these compositions. More serious collectors will be a bit annoyed at this title though. These four offerings are obviously from a variety of sessions, so why doesn't London/Decca reissue more of this material as ""Double Decker"" CDs instead of giving us bits and pieces on this ""Jubilee"" compilation. Reuniting the original sessions would be an altogether more welcome release than this title, which while well played, suffers from an overall lack of cohesion."
5,Telemann: Viola Concerto; Don Quichotte; Hamburger Ebb und Flut /ASMF * Marriner,Telemann: Viola Concerto; Don Quichotte; Hamburger Ebb und Flut /ASMF * Marriner is orginally a Decca recording from 1977 and it was then released on CD in 1991. This recording is under the direction of Neville Marriner who leads the Academy of St Martin-in-the-fields. Nicholas Anderson has written the music notes. Highly recommended. 5/5.
2,This book's structure and extra substance makes it tedious,"The book is around the main concept of defining ""totalitarianism"" and how it's viewed by American culture and people, through several decades.I hoped the book was much shorter and the chapters were divided with subtitles. You might find the book interesting, but personally I find it mostly boring. Nonetheless, the first chapter has some very interesting and surprising historical facts that I enjoyed a lot."
2,"""The Well-Adjusted Child"" is far better","This is not a terrible book. Although the author is clearly quite superstitious (Christian), and some of the reasoning reflects the logical breaks there, this is a worthwhile read.However, covering the same ground far better is, ""The Well-Adjusted Child: The Social Benefits of Homeschooling,"" by Rachel Gathercole:The Well-Adjusted Child: The Social Benefits of Homeschooling"
3,Essential For True Airplane Freaks,"This release may look and sound like a bootleg, but that's part of its appeal, particularly for listeners who have admired this band from the beginning. Compensating for the erratic audio quality (not great, yet not abysmal either) are spirited performances by Jorma Kaukonen (guitar) and Marty Balin (vocals) that Airplane fans will not want to miss. The set list doesn't vary much in comparison to other live discs by the band, but this is still a historic document from the days when The Music Mattered!"
2,The performance is good..the production is poor,I am a major JA fan...I am NOT a big fan of recordings such as this...the sound quality is poor...very middy sounding...lacking low end and the high end is thin and hissy. It does improve alittle as it progresses along. It leaves you a bit fatigued at the end...after assaulting your ears. You can barely hear what Jack Casady is doing on his bass...Keep in mind this was recorded during summer 1967...Grace had just joined the band a few months prior.I think they could have put alittle better effort into the remastering of this recording.If you want to hear great live recordings...stick to BLESS ITS POINTED LITTLE HEAD and THIRTY SECONDS OVER WINTERLAND..I would guess this was recorded off somebodys pocket tape recorder from the audience....would hate to think this came off the soundboard..
4,Great document /very good sound,"My two cents worth on this CD are that this is a great set of songs from when Jefferson Airplane were very energetic and more Marty Balin led,and also that the sound really isn't bad at all(just check out the samples here...they are very representative).I found this to be one of the better ""import"" live JA releases. Just get this and ""Last Flight"" and you've got all the good ones!"
2,Way to difficult for kids,I bought this game for my 5 year old son who loves Shrek. This game was way too difficult for him to play by himself. Shrek is just too hard to manouver and the tasks are too difficult for a child.
5,video game,"Game was in great condition, service was great, i would buy from this seller again. thank you"
5,Fun game for the girls,"Unfortunately, they scratched it pretty bad after only 1 week of use. But for that one week, they enjoyed it."
1,Shrek Extra Large,"This game is not very good as one could take from my rating it 1 star out of 5. The training in the start of the game is spread out across several different training grounds and their is no logical flow to the training. Also, the aspect of emmiting gas at your enemies is funny to a potty mouthed five year old but no one else. Finally, the usage of the top down view map to get to the different areas is boring and obviously needs some work. In conclusion, Shrek Extra Large focuses on how big a fart you have instead of fun and interesting gameplay (Don't buy it!)"
4,"A game that is good, but not a must have!","I love Harry Potter and will until the day I die, but this game only deserves four stars! The graphics are worse than the last game, except for the fact that Harry is no longer a midget. Good for Harry fans, but get the cheat codes!..."
5,Very Good,"This game, harry potter and the chamber of secrets, is................................................................................................................................in one word, well, actually.....it is SURE hard to describe it in just ONE word..... some of the words are: TERRIFIC, WONDERFUL, EXCELLENT, FIVE STARS, SUPREME, EXTREME, SUPER, SURPRISING, PACKED-WITH-ADVENTURE, THRILLS, AND ACTION! It is just TOO wonderful!"
3,Harry Potter,"This game is alright, nothing special. I am dissapointed because I was expecting it to be similar to HP and the sorcerer's stone for GBC, and it is not. The graphics are the best part of the whole game because they are in 3D. You can get frustrated easily because you can easily get stuck and not be able to move on. There is also only one slot for a saved game."
4,cool game,"My bro has this game. I've played it a few times...pretty good game! Entertaining and a must have for any Harry Potter fan. The only thing that kept this game from getting 5 stars is the settings are awfully dark, so it's hard to see on important levels like when you have to copy a Professor's complicated wand movements. Besides that, cool game! Watch out for the evil rats!"
3,Ok,Ummm... I was expecting more. It was good. Really short. i beat it after about a day. Great graphics. The fighting is a bit odd. Good game overall for younger kids.(I'm almost 15)Umm... I think that's about it... It wasn't a bad game just a little too easy.
2,"Believe it or not, the first one was better.","THe sad thing about this game is that the other one was much better. Better music and spell organization, as well as a better view. It is too short, and you only basically sneak around. For the duel with Malfoy, the Computer is in control, and Harry knew that Fawkes was in the Basilisk room."
4,boring...,"I got this for christmas last year and i must say it's kinda boring. I got through gringotts in about the first day i got it, and then i got to hogwarts. I got through most of hogwarts ok, then i had to go through filch with the invisibility cloak. I'm still stuck there, after about 4months!except, i dont play it anymore, so it's not like i've been trying...If you like playing a repetitive game thats impossible to beat, get this game. ..."
2,Not so good,"This game is fun for the first 20 minutes, but then it gets just boring. At the end of the game when you fight the basilisk, all it is is a worm that slithers in a circle, and you have to shoot at it with you wand to kill it. Overall, i thought that this game was a really disapointing game made from a cool book and ok movie. It may be kind of fun to play it the first time through, but i would never want to replay the game."
4,Good Game!,"I really liked it. It had lots of action. Once you started playing, and got the hang of it, it was fun to play. So be patient at the beginning....You have to really think before you make any moves. The game kept me on my toes the whole time. I enjoyed it very much and highly recommend it."
3,ok,"OK, this game is kinda good and I like it a bit.The graphics are not so good and the bean challenges are sorta hard. The Basililsk is so dumb it like shoots little green thingies out of its mouth at you and you never get the sword. If I were to remake this game I would have you fight basililsk with sword, have you be able to fly the car, have more spells, make gringotts a little easier, and change the invisibility cloak(you find it in the hallway and it makes you invisible for a little while then goes back to where you found it-but is an advantage, its very hrd to sneak by Snape otherwise).This is not worth your money, unless you are a Harry Potter total mainaic."
4,Great!,"I've had a little issues staring the game, but if you hold down the START button and turn it on it starts up just fine. I haven't had the time to beat it yet, but it's very entertaining absolutely lovely.<3 Harry Potter FanaticTwilight Sucks."
5,by the power of Grayskull...,"How many times you heard this famous phrase....and i still love it. The game is what you are expecting from watching the show, a lot of of fighting against skeletors and others, but you have to use your brain to complete the level...using your brain for a video game? what a good concept...love the game, great graphics and what is better than hearing on your game boy advance: by the power of Grayskull...."
4,Most happy fun yes yes ever!,"I played the Japanese release of this video game in 1987 while the GameBoy Color was still in Beta testing and it was called 'MegaFunHappyGoGoBuyMore Boy'.This game is simply spectacular! The control, color, and weight are ideal!This game is the Wizard of Oz of our time--Must Have A+++***+*++*% !!"
4,Grows on you the longer you watch,"At first I was kind of ""Here we go another low buget gay film"". It started a little slow for me but the longer I watched the more I was like ""Shhh! Their British and I am trying to concentrate"". Cause my partner and pets were all distruptive and such. I really felt drawn to the dark haired character even though he was straight, my life was and is quite similar. Hanging out with the wrong crowd falling and rising above. Living with stranger who you remember for the rest of you life because they changed your life forever. This is a great gay film that does not force sex down your throat. (Not that I would have minded) It was a relief to so a good gay story that was not about getting laid. Lastly watch the previews cause Bear Cub and My Wife Maurice seem to be hillarious and at the same level of interest."
4,Los Panchos - and Romance,"I have no real knowledge of what is spanish romance or songs associated with spanish romance. But I ordered this CD from Amazon after reading what other reviwers had written about Los Panchos and got it for my family, Guess What?! The family had me syn this CD into their MP-3, so I take it for granted that Los Panchos came across big time. If I am ever told to get more spanish romantic music, I will know where to start."
4,"Rhythmic Latin America, warm sound, exquisite",This is good Latin American and Cuban in styleThey sing along beautifully with warm and deep sounding guitar chords accompanimentHaving obtained Eydie Gorme music CDs I became attracted to the companions of her songs. Recommended to play often
5,Very effective method,"I know a fair amount of standard Arabic, and I just wanted to learn to communicate with the Egyptian vocabulary. The method is incredibly good, and even beginners would learn a fair amount. The conversations have humor and are very creative while drilling normally boring stuff. I just wish the method had something written about verb conjugations and cost less. The past tense is taught at the very end of the lessons, and not all cases are covered. But after what I heard, I recommend all Pimsleur courses. (The challenge is to find compatible grammars in them.)"
3,OK for recording live tv but....,I have purchased Riproar as a PVR. It is OK to record shows but sometimes it will not record and it tells me memory is full but it is not. Also my TV needs 3 digit channel changing code this thing only sends 2 digits if only 2 are required. For example to enter channel 25 you have to enter 025 on my TV but this thing only sends 25 and there is no way to change this. Also it comes with only one video audio cable so you can only get the signal in but not out. Riproar is OK for a toy but if you want to use it to record a scheduled TV show it is not that good. If you want to have PVR buy something else.
3,Early demos cashed in,"The previous reviewer notes that this CD features no info as to origins of this recording. It is some demos produced by Georgio Gomelsky in early 1967 while Daevid Allen was in the band, some of the only Softs recordings to feature him. After the band got somewhat popular with ""Third"" and Gong started to take off, Gomelsky first issued them in 1971 as a cash-in, and, much like The Beatles Tony Sheridan tapes, they've been repackaged over and over again. If you are a fan, they are interesting. ""That's How Much I Need You Now"" could stand on its own (just piano & plaintive Wyatt vocal) but the rest pale in comparison to future recordings. Which you probably should expect."
5,The Indiana Jones of Cosmology!,"Thrilling! This is, to my knowledge, the only book where the adventure that sometimes accompanies the scientific deeds, receives its credits. The numbers of things that must be controlled so that a subtle experiment like that of COBE be realized beggars the imagination. This is a great book. If you wish you can also learn quite a bit of the very fundamental physics of the early universe."
1,bad at any price,I bought this used for 50 cents and didn'tget my money's worth. The author's pompousstyle is offputting and the content of thebook has been much better covered by others.
1,RUN - Don't Walk - Away from this item,"Is it possible to give an item no stars? If so, this product qualifies. I had my unit for a few weeks and the DVD player started acting up. Before two months were finished, it had quit. GoVideo's suggestion: use a lens cleaner. I sent the unit back and they replaced it with a 2150 model, but their warranty covers a second unit only for the remainder of the original warranty. Guess what? After two months, it went south too. My suggestion: Instead of buying a Go-Video product, save yourself some time and just burn your money."
1,Terrible!!!,"The first unit broke after a month and a half. After waiting nearly six weeks, Go Video sent me a replacement that then broke about 13 months later. This product is a piece of junk! Save your money!"
4,Simply divine.,The simplicity of the way bro. Lawrence shares immediately brings an awareness of how God made it so simple to come into His presence. The encouragement of the practice brings the hunger we need to stay with it. The book truly is a classic that I have waited for and have been so blessed to read. Knowing the relationship that God wants for each of us and His simply incredible love is truly simply divine.
4,Presence,"This is a great book and helps think through the omnipresence of God. God is always there and we can practice the awareness of God's presence in all we do.For more commentary on the book, click on or cut and paste the following link into your web browser:[...]This book ""Practicing the Presence of God,"" by Brother Lawrence, is worth the read and comes highly recommended."
2,"Wonderful book, look for a better edition","This is a great book, with practical application for the spiritual practice of all Christians of any denomination. This edition, however, is heavily abridged, cutting the much larger original down to about 95 pages."
3,Somewhat plodding...,I'm finding it very difficult to keep up with reading this book. I thought reading the day to day life instances of a holy man would be little more engaging.See other reviews to see if this book is for you. Maybe it just isn't for me.
4,Yamaha YZF & WRF Performance Projects Review,"Not nearly as detailed or as helpful as the CRF Performance Handbook, however, if you like Yamaha motorcycles you'll probably enjoy reading this book anyway. I'm glad I added it to my collection."
3,Very basic information.,I was a little disappointed by this book. I was expecting more technical information. For example; the project for suspension upgrade is little more than how to remove the components and send to a professional shop. This book might be ok if you are completely new to motorcycles. If your not a newbie spend your money on a shop manual.
3,Decent B-sides,"If you are a real fanatic, I guess you should purchase it. but the B-sides aren't all that intriguing. Average at best."
2,Historical views,"Grab yourself a thick history book and land your back under a tree. Play this CD in the background and let the flutes, cymbals and drums cheerfully take you places you've never been before. Enjoy"
5,Music of the Crusades,This is one of my most favorite CD's and one of the best purchases on Amazon. I love this type of Music and I love the Crusaders as well... this is awesome CD... it conjures up great images in the mind.... Glad to have it in my collection.
5,Time machine,"This CD (a reissue of an LP dating from the 1970s) brings the Crusades and its people to life. There are recruiting songs, songs of loss and longing, songs of dedication. There is a beautiful song full of reverent wonder at the experience of being in the Holy Land. And there is the song purportedly written by Richard the Lionhearted while imprisioned by the Emperor. Too frequently we read history as if it were something enacted by people of two dimensions, somehow removed from our living emotions and complexities. This recording helps to restore some of the living emotions of those who went before us. They were as we are and as they are so shall we be to those who follow us."
3,It's ok for a spare,I just bought it for a spare. It'll work in a pince. It's not the greatest for a permanent ligature though.
1,Tricked Into Buying,"I thought that this CD was Bonnie Raitt because I had asked to be notified by e-mail when a new CD came out. I was excited because my husband is really a fan, and I thought this would be a great surprise gift.To our great disappointment, this was Bonnie Raitt music done ""bluegrass"" style. I like bluegrass. I like Bonnie, but the renditions were awful. We could not even listen to the entire CD."
3,It's exactly as I expected.,"First, I don't understand how anyone could be ""tricked"" into thinking this is a Bonnie Raitt album. It's clearly marked as ""Bluegrass celebrates Bonnie Raitt"", and listed under ""Various Artists"".That said, I was expecting bluegrass-style covers of Bonnie Raitt songs and that's exactly what I found. They're up-beat and easy to listen to, and that's what I was looking for as background music at work."
2,Little more than a karaoke disc for Bonnie fans,"I ran across this for a couple of bucks at a yard sale. The woman seller said ""It's not Bonnie Raitt. I thought it was."" Well, that's obvious when you see a title like this, or ""In The Style Of...."" or ""...Plays ______"" whoever. But my best friend loves Bonnie & is starting to enjoy Bluegrass, and loves to sing, so I snagged it for her. The players on this disc are adequate, and though not Seldom Scene, Sam Bush, Alison Krauss quality, they play much better than I ever could. It's decent for singing along with, and that's about all."
4,I actually own this so...,"I bought this ...partly just to find out what this Pipex system thing was all about. Its pretty cool... for a large chunk of plastic. The trick is you buy a few of these sets and build them how you like. Assembly is incredibly simple, since each set comes with about three pieces and all you do is pull a piece off and stick it where ever you like, repeat, et cetera. They dont hold as many DVDs as the description said and you're supposed to buy multiple sets. Despite all its flaws it serves its purpose and looks kinda cool in the process."
3,Cable Oragnizer?,I think you hook up a bunch of these and run wires through them. Kind of an organizing thing...I think anyway.note: the rating level i gave it doesn't mean anything as i had to put one in order to post
1,I know what this is,"Its a game/dvd case holder/tower. If you click on see a larger picture, you acn see what it is holding. Pretty stupid looking."
4,"Good, but definately not the best","To the user reviewing this before me. This computer is by far not the best. It's GeForce FX5600 is definately a disappointment, a Radeon 9800 Xt/Pro or a GeForce FX5950 Ultra would make it alot better. 200 GB drive is nice, but I would replace it with 2 10,000 RPM WD Raptors in a Raid Array. 512 MB of SD RAM? What were they thinking? Clearly Double Data Rate memory is better, so why even bother with the Synchronous RAM, oh well. Good computer with the software bundles, but could use some help and fine tuning.Good for the average gamer or video editor, but by no means a dream machine for a hardcore gamer."
5,Fulfills its mandate...,"The writer describes a variety of unique and creative careers. He discusses the pros and cons of these jobs and what you need to do to get them. As hack writing goes, this guy has flashes of impish insight and wicked wit within the mostly pedestrian prose. It was probably written quickly under deadline pressure for a small amount of money. However, the author succeeds in fulfilling the mandate for a book of this kind. It is what it claims to be, no more, no less: an informative, how-to guide."
1,do your research,disregard my star rating for this item.connected to computer and t.v. correctly but image shows only as flowing lines of color.only later did i find out that the t.v. has to be RGB compatible and not Y'PbPr. find out if your t.v. supports RGB through component inputs and figure out how to configure it to accept RGB instead of Y'PbPr.
2,It is what it is,"The product was shipped in a timely fashion and was in good condition, but was not what I needed. It simply breaks out the the RGB connection from the DVI but does not convert to Y-Pb-Pr."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"This does NOT work to connect the DVI-i port on my GeForce Video card to my TV using the Component Video. Don't waste your money. It takes a bit more technology to make this conversion than a simple cable. To extend the life of my RCA wide screen HD TV, I had to buy a converter at $120. Again, don't expect a simple cable to do the necessary conversion. Save your money."
5,Great help for those looking to start up an off premise catering biz.,Very insightful. Loads of info. I struggled chosing a book to help me start my business but end result was thisbook and i am very happy i chose it.
4,A great value for the $20 sale price,"I bought this on a whim after seeing it for $20 in the ""bottom of the page"" section. My expectations were fairly low, but Black & Decker products are usually pretty reliable, and what's $20?The accessories that came with the pruner were nearly worth the $20 alone. A folding serrated blade and a sturdy pair of clippers, along with a decent pair of gloves. The bag itself is quite well-made, and seems built to last.The pruner is slightly underpowered, but it gets the job done on smaller branches. Don't count on the battery lasting long enough for very heavy jobs, but at least you can plug it in with an extension cord.For $20, it's a heck of a deal if you only need this for light work. However, if you're going to do some heavy trimming, spring for something more powerful."
2,Where's the Battery?,"The shrubber didn't come with the battery!! I assumed it would, but none was in the box, just the gaping hole in the back of the shrubber with nothing to plug the charger into. Nice kit, but not worth the price if I have to spend additional $$ for the battery."
4,Good deal for light gardening,"This product is a great buy, specially with the two added gardening tools, gloves, and the bag included in the price.The battery charges relatively fast, and lasts an appropriate amount of time. I had about five bushes in my backyard when I first bought this product and I could cut all of them with one ""charging"". Once the power runs out though, you can plug it up and use the trimmer while charging if the extension cord is long enough. However, the trimmer is not the most powerful one. It's more for thinner branches (other reviewers have already mentioned that). The other tools are not high-end quality, yet they are sturdy and get the job done.I've had this product for over six years now and it's still working. Great buy!"
4,eXtreme Programming,"Weird. I cannot find in the book most of what Ben Jury says. Moreoever, I cannot agree with him saying ""[c]ode reuse should be 'black box', ie ActiveX dlls or controls"". Doesn't he know the success of Linux?By replacing the first 30pages with eXtreme Programming, rather than just VB error handling, you will enjoy better programming."
1,Major Disappointment,"As an independent VB consultant/programmer, I buy a lot of VB books to keep my skills up to date, and to learn new techniques. I had high hopes when I first saw this title. Error handling is a critical requirement in any real-world VB program, but most VB texts don't discuss it in depth.Unfortunately, this book provides a very simplistic approach to error handling. Among other things, it omits any mention of error logging and tracing (i.e., writing out error info to a log file, and tracing the error stack). It's basic architectural recommendations for error handling look cumbersome and unworkable in a real-world context.I agree with the earlier reviewer (Ben Jury) - this book should not be given to junior programmers, or anyone else for that matter."
2,"Some userful information, but most of it impractical","While there are some useful tips in this book, there are also a lot of impractical ideas. It comes as no suprise to find that the author teaches VB at a college level, because many of the suggested standards are only practical as an academic exercise and would not work well out in the ""real world""."
2,I was hoping for somthing more.,"I rented this movie years ago and bought it because it was less than a dollar plus shipping. Bottom line is that it is below average in almost every criteria I can think of: cinamatography, plot line and dialogue. I am a semi fan of Bai Ling and know that she has made a career out of low budget independent films. I also know that she can act well enough to pull a lot of films up to the level of being at least "" worth watching "". Not this time. If you are a collector of her playing the asian hooker roles Then you might wish to add this to your collection. Other than that I would suggest that you try her in "" Gene Generation "" or "" Beautiful Country "" Both are inexpensive and better choices."
4,One of Her Best,"A good, solid English style mystery, the kind that is getting harder and harder to find. I really enjoyed this book."
3,Kool game,"This games wrestlers don't even look real, they look like there all on steroids. They remind of some earlire wrestling games such as WCW vs. NWO World Tour, Wich graphics were good for there time. But if you can't change Graphic quality in 7 years your in the wrong field. Pluss it doesn't have Sting, Ric Flair, or Lex Luger. It seems as if this was made for a WWF fan. But i'm both a Wcw and WWF Fan. But feel cheated because its lack of true legends."
4,The definitive pro-wrestling game for the throwbacks...,"I was not happy with the first installment of the game and probably should have had more patience with it. Coming from Smackdown! and the other WWE PS2 games, this one had a lot lacking.However, revisiting this game years later to play as Abdullah the Butcher, I am quite pleased with the gameplay and the choice of classic pro wrestling characters.The roster is a who's who of classic wrestling. I have enjoyed playing as David von Erich and unleashing the power of The Claw by a late legend of wrestling. There are many, many more legends to play with.The moveset becomes a bit repetative, and I've experienced a bug or two. But its still a lot of fun.The title says it all. ""Legends of Wrestling"""
1,Legends Of Wrestling,"I bought this game & have been kicking myself ever since.How do you play this stupid gsme?The controls are awful.Unless you have REAL fast hands{I don't}save your money.Oh,graphics are ugly too.You've been warned."
2,Bombastic and heavy handed ...,"Solti's only attempt at Handel's Messiah is admirable in effort but the result is mixed at best. It sounds at times bombastic and heavy handed rather than grand and majestic. Although I am a fan of te Kanawa, she is not the right choice for the soprano part; her singing lacks the lightness and speed that the arias require. The diction, especially in ""For unto us ..."" is so peculiar and contrived that it's almost unbearable to listen to. For better balance of majesty, tonality and pace, consider Andrew Davis' rendition with the Toronto Symphony from EMI. Robert Shaw's Telarc version is not bad either, although it is not without it's flaws. For period instrument recording, my choice is Hogwood's version from L'oiseau-Lyre."
4,A Great Sci-Fi Fantasy Read !!,"I enjoyed Paul Kidd's book very much. His characters are well developed, allowing the reader to vividly picture them, as well as their surroundings, with the help of the great illustrations provided. The reader learns to love these characters and relate to them personally as the story develops. The plot continually develops, maintaining the reader's interest until the very last page. This great work evokes emotions in the reader that may be surprising. The quick reading book contains everything from love, war, terror, tragedy, triumph and power. Try it, you'll love it !!"
5,Honest and lyrical,"Heid Erdrich's book is a beautiful meditation on motherhood, heritage, and the varied and unpredictable facets of love. A very necessary book."
1,The Mother's Tongue,"I thoroughly enjoyed the lyrical and gorgeous poems. All are sweet and meaningful, and beautifully, thoughtfully written."
3,Spiffy work shoes,"THe polisher looks good and does the job, albeit, with an under-powered motor. Maybe 1/4 horse-power more would be the key."
3,Worth the money but !,"The product is made very well, easy to assemble, easy to operate.The only flaw I found which is a major flaw is the motor is not very powerful. If you place your shoe to close to buffer the motor stops. In other words you must place your shoes very lightly to the buffer in order for the polisher to be effective. All in all still worth the money."
2,Not for everyday use!!!,"This shoe polisher lasted less than three months and it was only used by my husband for a quick buff to shine up his shoes before leaving for the office. The brush broke off and we couldn't find any replacement parts anywhere. So we just bought another thinking that we'd at least have spare parts if anything broke again. Well, the same side brush broke as did the one on the other side. The problem is that the brush should be on a metal axle rod and not plastic. This whole thing is made of cheap plastic with the exception of the tall handle! Definitely NOT worth the price!"
4,Shoe polisher review,"Works well, could be a little easier to attach polishing pads, it took an inordinate amount of time to do."
5,Couldnt put it down,"This book had a lot of everything. Drama and excitement. I was with ""Sticks"" the entire time. This is one of my favorite reads this year and I would love to see this on the big screen or on a straight to DVD deal."
3,it was OKay,"I only gave this a 3 star, because it started off kinda slow. The book was okay, it was kinda weird with the whole rap star thing. It wasnt one of the best books i've read, but it wasnt bad, not something to go crazy over or read again."
3,"potential, but stuck in the streets","The writer has great potential, but he seems to be to focused on writing ""street"" lit, instead of writing good lit.The over use of slang was really hard to deal with. I still dont know how to pronounce ""boaw"" and I live outside of Philly."
2,A little unbelievable,"I picked up this book on the strength of the reviews that I read and I'm sorry that I did. Maybe because I'm not from South Philly but some of the jargon kind of threw me, like what is a ""boaw"" or a ""jawn""? And the story seemed a little unbelievable to me, I mean here you have this guy who has no visible means of income caring for his daughter and he thinks that can't nobody in the world care for her like he can but he doesn't want to go out and get and keep a job to always provide for her. He's blackmailing the biggest rapper in the game, he's beating up football players and he's really a nobody and in the end the rapper is going to let him keep some money? It was a little unrealistic to me, but that's just my opinion."
2,A reference index,"This book is disappointing. It is not a book on theory. It's not a book on implementation. It names a technique, add a shallow description and quickly pass to the next topic. This is the kind of book I would use for learning a couple of words about compilers to drop it later in a conversation. If this is just what you want, then it's OK."
4,Probably the least bad of all case books out there,"A book will never really tell you what it's like to be in a real case interview, but this one is the least bad of all books that I've read. Forget about crack-the-case, wet-feet, vault etc. If you only want to get one, get this one. Then try to get your hands on the prep books of the MBA schools. The MIT/Sloan and UMich ones are pretty good.How did my interviews go? Got offers from McKinsey, Bain, BCG and a couple of others."
3,Yummo,It was actually a mother's day gift for my daugher so I haven't used it but both daughter and grandaughter love it.Just...a lot'o fun!!
1,Very Disappointing Save Your money,"Product is cheap, bag was all smashed and ripped. Was definately not worth the money. Very disappointing and was a waste of money. Save your money do not buy. If I had to do over I would have sent it back."
2,I've had better,I love the smell of this chapstick and I got it because I had tried the coconut one before and I love that one. But this one is sticky and I hate the feeling of it on my lips. I wouldn't get this chapstick ever.
4,"Great scent, but a bit pricey","Thr scent is wonderful, and the balm is very good quality. It is a bit pricey, especially because it doesn't last a real long time."
4,What were they thinking of?,"It's incredible the scripts Universal put Deanna Durin through. This one is screwy start to finish, not helped much by Franchot Tone's awkward performance (I guess being married to Joan Crawford didn't make life easy for him) and a script that at no point makes any sense. The funniest aspect is destitute Deanna wearing a high fashion wardrobe throughout (Adrian, I believe) and making a brief reference to it with a straight face. Her musical performances are nothing short of divine, with ""Nessun Dorma"" simply brilliant. What a voice and what a talent! The production values and supporting cast as usual are toprate all the way but largely when you've seen one Durbin film scriptwise you've seen them all. Imagine what kind of career she would have had at M-G-M (I know Louis B. Mayer never got over letting her get away). She never even would have done this kind of film. No wonder she left Hollywood behind."
3,Wonderful Deanna!,"This must be the lowest budget movie made starring Deanna Durbin. What's up with the fake food? Where they limited because of the war effort? But as usual, beautiful Deanna with her great voice makes this movie worth watching."
4,"Great works, good performance","It sounds good. That's pretty much all there is to be said. Lovely compositions, in a performance that does them justice."
5,Sublime at the pace of Jack Johnson,"If you want to get your Grandma to like sublime, that's probably not going to happen but she will love this cd.All tracks are right on with timing and harmony and the quality of recording is the highest.For a Sublime fan, it's a new, more relaxed way to enjoy Sublime. Even though the steel guitars are relaxing, they still have new and interesting sounds and harmonies throughout the whole album. (Eg. April 29, 1992).My personal faves are Santeria and Caress me Down."
5,Love it & Not Even A Big Sublime Fan,"I had bought this cd for my boyfriend who is IN LOVE with sublime and i am not a huge fan but i like some of their songs but very few and far between.I was expecting a hawaiian guy to be belting out lyrics but it was just the music and at first i was upset but then i listened to more and more songs and loved it with out the lyrics! it's so comforting and relaxing and i could listen to the songs over and over while my boyfriend would sing the words or at least mouth themGreat buy and cd and i suggest you get it, you can preview the tracks to see if you like itThis CD has been great on our 7 hour drives and we listen to it repeatedly, it is also great for a hawaiian party for people of all ages or for an ""older"" crowd that has heard the music before"
