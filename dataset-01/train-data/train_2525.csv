5,My 6 year old daughter loves it!,The variety of fun games keeps her interested when we're on long trips. The graphics are nice and she likes to be able to play against Barbie and her friends.
2,borrrrringgggggggggggggggg!!!!!!!!!!!,"this is just classic games like memory, tick tac toe , and connect but it made so it is all barbie like it is really meant for young kids and i really disliked it."
4,It's actually entertaining..,"It's a few minigames. However,this game is actually entertaining. I spent a good half a hour playing the bubble game.I've had this game for years,it was the first game I owned. Maybe that's why I like it so much,but anyway,I recommend it. Just forget about the Barbie part,if you don't like her."
5,Bunn Pour-O-Matic Coffee Brewer,"This is my third Bunn Pour-O-Matic Coffee Brewer. They are pricey but they last a long time. Twenty years on the last one. The DeCoty Coffee Company in San Angelo Texas has cleaned mine several times at a minimal cost. There are cheaper versions of the one I bought but it's worth it. Perfect coffee, fast fast fast, and one of my favorite kitchen appliances for thirty years or more. Rita McWhorter"
3,Great if it fits your needs,"Pros:- Always hot water, useful for many different applications from making oatmeal to tea (or filling a pot of water that will boil super-quick)- Lasted with no problem for 10 years of at least 3xweek use- Super easy to make a lot of coffee.But it's in my garage because- The always-hot water feature is an enormous energy hog. Not green and not cheap if you're not making coffee all day long- Not so great at making just 2 cups of coffee. Because that water is always hot, it evaporates quickly. So if you didn't use it yesterday, figuring out how much water to add to make two cups of coffee today is very inexact. One way is to pour water in til some comes out. Again, wasteful- Replacement parts aren't standard/widely available"
5,Still going strong after 40+ years,"I got this out of my grandma's attic a couple of days ago. My grandpa used to be a coffe salesman for Hills Bros and took this machine to trade shows. It has got to be at least 40 years old. I just plugged it in today and it fired right up. Coffee was hot, no leaks. Brews faster than most Mr. Coffee type machines. It is a testiment to the guys at Bunn that this machine still makes good coffee."
3,Not pleased with it,"My husband was looking for the perfect coffee pot to make HOT coffee. Coffee is never hot enough for him. He thought this pot would do it. There is a reserve of water always in the back of coffee brewer. This keeps hot all day and night, so when you add water for your new pot, the hot water comes out immediately for a quick pot of coffee.But the coffee gets hotter by sitting on the warmer. Coffee is not hot enough immediately.Also the coffee never seems to be strong enough. Using the same Dunkin Donuts coffee I always use, but I have to use an extra scoop each time using more coffee than ever. The pot sprays the water down, does not drip, which I think makes the coffee not as strong. For the amount of money this pot costs, I am not happy with it. Want to go back to my cuisinart coffee pot which everyone seems to have."
5,Perfect,"I purchased the Bunn A10 from AMZN.com a couple of months ago and I have to say I think it is the perfect device. The old-school yet modern design, austere but purposeful functionality, and quality engineering make this a ""10"" in my book. I have spent good money on many coffee machines over the years and believe I will be a Bunn customer forever.Well done!"
3,"Sounds like Garbage? Er, maybe the other way around.",See where Garbage got their sound from. Good album but Cuckoo and Pubic Fruit are my faves by Curve
4,"Very Good, But Sad","Khyber is living in poverty in a poor part of Toronto with her family. Her father abandoned them when Khyber's two autistic brothers were born. I can tell you, having an autistic child is not easy. Autistic children cannot look at you in the eye or even talk. Plus, it costs money for treatment. And you can imagine, with the shortage of money that Khyber's mother has, it would be hard to pay for treatments for two autistic children. But Khyber loves her brothers dearly and would never let anything bad happen to them. But one thing Khyber looks forward to in life is her friend X, who lives in the park. X is a very mysterious old lady who is intensely afraid of the secret police and will not tell Khyber her real name. When X suddenly dissapears, Khyber is devastated. She just had to find X. Her journey would probably be one of the scariest things that would ever happen to her. read on..."
5,Lil Dickens,Tale of a young bear cub and his mischievous misadventures in the wild. This an excellent family fun adventure film.
5,"""Dante's Inferno"" meets ""Friends""","An amazing book. Funny and terrifying. It makes me think of Catch-22 -- a strong, independent character forced to survive in an insane and dangerous world.I've read this one several times, and it's a can't-put-it-down adventure each time."
5,Much better than Gran Turismo 3,Pros:Great graphics.Real handling that is more realistic than the arcade version.3 modes of play.Brilliant Artificial Intelligence.Cons:Can only customize your car by changing it's color and number.Overall:94%
1,Don&#65533;t buy it!,"This game is absolutely not be recommitted. The graphic is out of fashion and low quality and the cars are handling in a kind of tug, which is very unrealistic.Don't buy it!"
1,This Game is Outdated Already,This was just released and it's already outdated.They don't race the 355 in The Challenge anymore.They race the 360.
3,Sam Denov memory could be better,"The misadventures seem to amount to a few glasses of wine. But, he is a good story teller. The best is a lovely story about a friend's silver plated triangle.The unforgiving remarks about Reiner and some members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's percussion section seem out of line for a book that is not looking for a lawsuit.I found Mr. Sam Denov's story of the CSO to be well worded. I finished the book. But, I'd not re-read the parts about his musicians union troubles."
4,Ammeter,"A very good product at a very good price. However, this gauge does not come with a holding bracket and the installtion instructions are very difficult to follow. I'm not disappointed, but it took a lot of work to get the job done right."
5,Dark Before the rising son,Great Book~ as always ~ a true shame Laurie McBain doesn't write anymore~! Now the world has lost Kathleen Woodiwiss we are truly deprived of great talent~
5,A Good Read,"This book is an old favorite. I actually ordered it to replace my other copy, which was falling apart. I love it!"
5,The Series,I love the story that is told in these book. I have them in paperback but I can only get the first two in Kindle. It would be nice to get the third one to go with them.
4,HARD!!,I like this game. The only thing I have a problem with is there are so many levels and are so hard to beat. It took me a week to finish the first level. It took me half a month to finish the game. But I still find it hard!
3,"Okay, but not good enough","This game is HARD at times. Men in black suits are surrounding you and sometimes you don't know what to do....This game deserved three stars because you know that all girls under 6 are in love with Barbie. Well, if it was even hard for me,... how is a little girl supposed to figure it out? What's the deal? I suggest you do NOT buy this game. Save your money and rent it, and THEN decide."
2,Fun - for the first week.,"Ok, this game is sorta cool, but not a ""Mom, I need new batteries"" every day kinda thing. You can hardly control Barbie, and her gadgets are LAME, LAME, LAME!!!!!!! Basically, this is for 4-8 year olds, not an 11 year old.~A Gamer"
5,An indispensable manual of direct action,"After a long wait, America's heirs to the Situationists come through with a wide-ranging, imaginative, and inspiring compendium of actions that people can take to challenge the status quo. Big and small, legal and il-, the 62 recipes run the gamut from dumspter-diving to banner drops, open relationships to locking down streets, monkeywrenching to coalition building. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the direct action tactics that have developed in anti-capitalist, anti-authoritarian circles in recent years.One gripe-- the section on ""undermining oppression"" is a clumsy and unfortunate endorsement of the kind of identity politics that have so recklessly divided the left."
2,Interesting but...,"I got the impression the author was more interested in proclaiming his own superiority than he was in providing useful information. Still, as a window into the Alinski-ite or Bolshevik mind, it has it's illuminating points."
1,"Recipes for what, pranks and vandalism?","This book is a political opinion book. There is no real anarchy here, just a variance of public opinion, a little vandalism, and some pranks. A bicycle parade is not anarchy. Making your own musical instruments is not anarchy. Modifying billboards, come on now. How about entering into non-monogomous relationships? There are some creative ideas for vandalism. I surely would not consider this any type of ""An anarchist cookbook"" as the cover says or any ""Recipe for Disaster"". If you want to know how to become a public annoyance and no how clue how to do that, then buy this book. This book targets the audience that is affraid of getting caught, willing to have a sit in, and play free music in the park. Go find anarchy elsewhere."
2,Doesn't deserve the title,"The activities described in the book are, almost without exception, harmless (if sometimes illegal) pranks or eco-friendly home ec. Handing out subversive pamphlets to college kids? Painting over billboards? More energy-efficient stoves? Is this what qualifies as a disaster these days? Your ""Rocket Stove"" is not going to stick it to The Man, I'm sorry. Don't buy this expecting anything interesting -- maybe grade schoolers would get a kick out of it, but that's about it."
2,not for the beginner,"While I have many Indian friends and watched many performances, I still was way out of the loop on this video. There is no instruction on how to do any of the steps. The ""instructor"" just goes for it. There are even shots of just her head so you have no idea what her body is doing and no way to know what you are supposed to be doing. And it's quite a short workout session."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"This production is like a bad High School PE class got ahold of a video camera and decided to 'make it big'. Absolutely no instruction, audio is unintelligible, and the dancers are not good enough for a workout video. In addition, the company Caiman.com will not let me return the video because it's been opened. BLAH!"
2,Disappointed,"I was quite disappointed with this video. It appeared to be a rather 'amateur' production with poor cues and instructions. The instructor appears to have difficulty talking since she's out of breath. I guess, I was expecting a higher standard like the belly dancing videos that are available. I enjoy bhangra music and have some concept of dancing to it so I found the moves boring and not quite to my expectations. I would skip this one even though I think the concept is great if someone could come up with a better production."
2,BHANGRA AEROBICS,"When I bought this dvd I was hoping for a very unique aerobics video, however, I was very disappointed. This is just like all aerobics videos, except it is not cued as well, the only difference is the music. The exercises therein are very hard on the joints (knees especially). It was also very hard to keep up with the pace of the instructor. It should say ""Advanced"" in the advertisement. Personally, after I bought this dvd and watched it once, I resold the item right away."
1,Doesn't work good.,"Unfortunatelly its doesn't work good,the values aren't actual. its could be a bad device, but I'm far away to send it back."
5,Brits Invade Again,"Hey I got this CD when they were first issued and if you like the Yardbirds, Them, Kinks, and other bands from the sixties, then this is for you. While keeping a fresh new feel for the album they still infuse the old feelings of yester-year.This will be on your play list for some time....I recommend it."
5,The Pictures all wrong but I Loved this movie!,Hi I am 13 years old and ever since I was 3 I loved Thomas and friends and Calling All Engines! is a better movie then Thomas And The Magic Railroad my copy came with A Bronze Diesel engine and I wish Boco was in the movie but sorry no luck. My only pet peave is why is their a Picture of a Calling All Engines! DVD With A Bronze Toby in front of it? Is he gonna be with another dvd sometime soon??!!!
3,Kid loves it,It is difficult for the adult to sit to watch this one. We (the adults) actually like watching the Island of Sodar with Alec Baldwin more.
1,Disapointed,We have several Thomas DVD's and older videos that are enjoyed on our house but this isn't one of them. The story is good but the narration is so monotone it is beyond boring to listen too.
5,Thomas' Big Movie,"This movie will feature Thomas and the other steam engines to work with the unhappy diesels. A new airport and new bridge is being built too. After a strom, it gets harder to get it done. Lady promises it will get done on time, but what happens when Diesel 10 returns?The DVD will feature a read along story, music videos, new games, and deleted scenes."
2,Not what you'd expect,This dvd is just a bunch of pictures with narration. I thought it would be animated. Very disappointed. Bummer that i can't return it since i had to open it to find out what it was.
2,Did I miss something or what?,"Everywhere I look, people are talking about how great of a movie Calling All Engines is and ""Oh!, It's soooooo much better than Thomas And The Magic Railraoad!"". In my opinion, this movie is just as much of a load of garbage that it's preceder was. It is POOOOORLY writen; I mean the dialogue is horrendous. But I think the straw the really broke the camel's back was when they cheekily added those stupid activities. WHY!!!! I'd be watching this movie and then out of no where, one of those activities would come on screen.I'm giving this movie 2 stars because I really do love Thomas, even though this movie does only deserve one."
5,Don't listen to the other guys!!,I don't know why in the HELL they let people who aren't fans of the games review them! Thisgames is one of the best simulation games for the Snes & Genesis! Buy this if you like real world war situations of the video game systems!! You won't be disappointed!!
1,Hard Ball not for indoor play,"The ball leaves plenty to be desired. The seam between the 2 colors, (which is a diffrent color than pictured), is much harder than the rest of the ball,the ball does not bounce well, forget about dribbling.It is heavier than anticipated. The ball leaves marks on painted walls and I recommend using it in an unfinnished space or outside. Poor ball for indoor hoops."
4,Good thrash 3.8 stars,"This was an album I stumbled upon by accident. And although they aren't well known they are still pretty good. Sure they aren't the next big thing to take on the Big Four, but hey thats what makes this genre fun to listen to. Sometimes you find a rare gem every once in awhile. Friends this is one of those albums. Really catchy lyrics and I like the vocals. The music is intense and the drumming is crisp and doesn't overpower the guitar at all. The opening riff of Mob Justice is one of my favorites in thrash. Chasin' Charlie is a good war song, as most thrash songs were at that time. Overall its a pretty good album. Its no RTl or Rust in Peace. But its a really good underrated album. Check it out if you get a chance."
4,another great but forgoten thrash band,"man there sure are a lot of them out there...the 80's were the perfect breeding ground for great thrash bands, bands like wrathchild america,heathen,meliah rage,forbidden,and of course-laaz rockit.while doing nothing new,what they did-they did well.professional ,hard hitting thrash, great axe grinders,great sound, and a screeching vocalist.this is,to my opinion,thier best album, with the opener-fire in the hole,being a classic thrash anthem,and one of the greatest opening riffs ever.i pray for thier return."
2,Their best.,"This is rockit's best album and that isn't saying much. Compared to any other thrash band out there, Laaz is just average and mostly bad attempts at thrash with poor lyrics and flow."
1,"""Finest American Luxury""","""Finest American Luxury?"" Give me a break. This and all other Hartmann wallets are now made by slave labor in Red China. Don't let them hose you. Hartmann sold out to the commies."
2,A good toaster for little bread.,"Medium to large slices of bread stick partially out of the toaster, and of course the part that sticks out doesn't get toasted. The sides don't get evenly toasted. Turning the bread slice over to even the toasting results in charcoal."
1,Arrived D.O.A,"I purchased this toaster, ..., when I turned it on and put 2 slices of bread in, the latch locked but the toaster would not start. Yes, the indicator light was on. I tried again and this time the latch would not lock. In any case I sent it back."
2,Villaware 5825 Uno Classic 2-slice Toaster,"I ordered this item, and loved it at first (for a couple of weeks) until it broke down, only one side of the toast got toasted. Something happened to the spacer/lifting mechanism and it pushed the slice of toast to one side instead of being in the center of the slot. It was a bit bulky in size on my kitchen cabinet. I wouldn't recommend anybody purchasing this toaster. I recently purchased a wonderful toaster from the Betty Crocker catalogue made in Canada, all stainless steel, absolutely beautiful, just the right size, and it performs three features more than the Villaware did. I thought the Villaware toaster was overpriced. Joanne Evens, Granite Bay, CA"
1,launch your burned toast,"Sitting on the counter this is a great looking toaster...until it is called into duty. No matter what setting I chose, the toast was burned and when it finally did pop up it was launched out of the toaster on onto the counter and sometimes onto the floor! Thinking this was just a ""lemon"" I exchanged it for another and the whole process was repeated. No matter how many times I tried it, or what setting, the toast ended up on my counter, burned beyond recognition. This is not a good buy at any price."
1,"Had toast for a month, anyway...","The Villaware 5825 looks great in the Kitchen. However, that's all it's doing for me right now. After a month or so, the toaster wouldn't latch when I push the knob down. It just laughs at me as I repeatedly attempt to make something as simple as toast. I suppose now I'll find out how the VillaWare warranty support is.In the meantime, I'll have to get something else to support my prodigious toasting needs. It will definitely not be from VillaWare."
1,Two-month Wonder Toaster.,"Two months out of the box and I'm wondering what is wrong with this toaster. The Villaware 5825 Uno Classic 2-Slice Toaster looks great with other chrome appliances and gadgets in our kitchen and the toast was great while it lasted. However, after only two months of service the dang thing won't latch down. Oh sure it's fun to laugh at my wife as she catapults raw toast out the Uno Classico, but we simply need more than comic relief from a toaster. Buyer beware."
1,HOW LONG WILL IT LAST???,"If you toast three times a year, this toaster should last you about ten years."
4,Big and beautiful,"The Villaware Uno two slice toaster is a big and beautiful piece of equipment. However, the dimensions given in the comparison table are of the box in which it is packaged. The toaster actually measures 81/2 x 81/2 x 11, making it an ideal fit for a standard appliance garage. Contrary to the features listing, it also has a high lift feature. The styling is definitely retro with very strong art deco features. This is a big, solid, well built toaster, and the front slide out tray is very convenient, as is the lighted on-off switch. The browning control produces very consistent results with toast, bagels and English muffins.The control is a bit on the heavy side, and a setting of 5 produces charcoal, while light toast requires a defrost setting rather than 3 as stated in the instruction manual."
5,One of the best,"This has to be one of the greatest ska/punk albums I have ever heard. No joke. Listen to songs like ""funny way"" and ""I didn't know"" and not get all giddy inside. I wish this band never broke up. F*ck drive thru for letting this album go out-a-print."
2,Definitely not leak proof,"The pictured mug is not exactly the mug you get.I have the mug in the picture, which is leak-proof, but one I received from Amazon has a different cap. The cap is flimsy and easily leaks (not just leaks, I would call it a pour). The model names are not on these mugs, Amazon should correct the picture as it is misleading to its customers. One of a few times a brick and motar store would have been better.The only good thing is that the base is interchangable with my superior leak proof cap. So I essentially own a leak proof mug and a half."
1,"Mug is a danger, as it will spill hot liquids all over you","This is supposed to be a ""travel"" mug. Yes, it keeps hot liquids hot for extended times... however, this also means that that extends the time that you can get burnt by hot liquid spilling, which I did. Who would expect a travel mug to leak from around the entire lid edge??Also, it does not fit in VW Passat (2000 year anyway) cupholder. I thought, perhaps, I could hang it by the long handle and that would work, except for the fact that this cup leaks and drips like crazy at the slightest bump, WITH the lid on and the drinking hole cover closed. I'm returning mine."
3,Ok but over priced.,It is OK. I like that it is stainless steel. No weird taste from plastic. I wish it was dishwasher safe. I think it is overpriced.
2,Too big for cupholder!,"I like the mug, in general, but it doesn't fit in my cup holders! (2003 Subaru). It also doesn't even begin to avoid leaking. I can tilt it in my cupholder and make it stay unless I take a corner, then it falls over and leaks everywhere, making it a pain to take to work with coffee already in it. I wouldn't buy it again!"
3,Leaky,"I really liked this mug until today. Today I was running to catch the bus and had this little traveler in the side pouch of my backpack. I thought the lid looked like the kind of thing that would stop a half full container of tea from spilling out. For some reason, it shot out the top of the container and landed all over my arm and my backpack. When I checked, the tea level had gone from a half of a container to a quarter. I don't mind that this mug leaks, because I didn't have a good travel mug before this, but I would like it much better if it didn't leak. Maybe I can find a replacement lid that will work better."
2,No Vacuum! - only marginal heat retention,"Pros: Great looking, great feel, easy to use, relatively spillproofCons: This is not a ""vacuum"" design. The walls may be double-insulated but this is not the same as a true ""vacuum sealed"" design. You can quickly feel the heat from the beverage dissipating through the outside wall of the mug. Top does ""weep"" if mug is set on its side.I am highly disappointed with this mug's inability (even after preheating) to keep a beverage adequately warm for more than about 30-40 minutes. I got sucked in with a great look and did not notice that there were no claims of this being a ""vacuum sealed"" model."
2,"average tasting coffee, not espresso","for all who are expert coffee tasters I will say 'lower your expectations'.1)This device makes good tasting coffee but far away from espresso. It lacks thickness and smell.2)The rubber tears off quickly.3) Hard to clean without using soap4) the bottom part is not polished so it changes its colour and builds up residue, which does not smell good. Also when left wet it forms white spots, which presumably come from the aluminium. ALUMINIUM IS DANGEROUS FOR YOUR HEALTH!5)don't fool yourselves reading other reviews and get a stainless steel one!"
5,The only way to brew espresso!,"I have an espresso maker just like this one (maybe alittle smaller) and it is GREAT! You can smell the espresso as it's working and once it's done... hmmmm.... Wonderful espresso! It's pretty fast too, I usually put it on while I'm getting ready for work (about 10-15 minutes) and get it on the way out the door."
4,i was wrong,"After some experimentation i've learned that i was just plain wrong about this product. I made 3 adjustments to the brew process that changed everything. First i switched coffee. I was using some beans i got from the Dominican Republic (not sure that was a factor). 2nd, I took the pot into the office and used water that is probably superior to my tap h2o @ home. Thirdly - and i think probably the main element - i used a gas range with a flame instead of my electric range at home. So there you have it! i've blundered! Consider my first review amended. For the $ it makes as good a java as you could expect!"
2,I can't unscew the top after I've brewed coffee!,"I am pretty strong, but very humbled at the fact that I cannot for the life of me, unscrew the top of this maker without a struggle! The worst part is, sometimes the pot is boiling away without the coffee coming up the spout, so I have to tighten the top just a little more in order for the coffee to percolate up. Then, it is nearly impossible to unscrew it later. I've bought new o-rings already with no difference. My husband even suggested a little vaseline in the threads; no difference.I used to have a smaller espresso maker a long time ago (I don't know the brand...) that was so easy, but because it was small, even on the smallest gas burner, I melted the handle. Instead of buying another replacement handle, I bought a larger pot so it would cover more of the gas flame. Now I'm sad I threw out my little pot!What an awful time when you really are looking forward to that first cup!!"
3,"Great idea, get a larger one","I have one this size and regret that I didn't buy a bigger one. They make them up to ""18 cup"" sizes. As a previous reviewer mentioned, this one only holds about one measuring cup of water in the reservoir and the maker refers to it as a 6 cup maker, so the 18 cup would make about 3 measuring cups worth of brew. Some of that is lost as steam during brewing.Also, this isn't really like expresso, it is more of a percolation process. (Anyone remember percolators?) It makes good strong coffee, 3.5 to 4 teaspoons of ground coffee fill the basket that makes about 1/2 of a standard coffee mug full.It is a little messy to clean but most expresso machines take as much maintenance.Hey Amazon, offer the larger ones."
3,There is a better way to go,"There is nothing wrong with the Bialetti. It is excellent.BUT...you really don't want to go with an aluminum stove top coffee maker. You want to go with stainless steel.Over time, there will be calcium buildup in the pot; unless you're smart and use distilled water (which results in better tasting coffee anyway). When you go to use one of the decalcifiers on the aluminum, an oxide will form that is impossible to clean.The inside will lose its shininess and possibly some of the metal, allowing aluminum to leach in to the coffee.This problem is avoided with a stainless steel stove top unit."
5,"Wonderful, low tech alternative!",I love this expresso maker. It's quick and easy to use and makes better expresso than you can get in most shops. Get it. Pairs up nicely with the Bodum tall milk frother for great capuccino.
4,Delish....,"I was thinking about buying a ""top of the line"" espresso maker like Starbucks Barista, but I decided to spend [price] and give this a try first. It is PERFECT for what I use it for. It makes great espresso and I am able to make decent iced mochas from it...(which was my reason for purchasing it). It doesn't make the BEST espresso that I have EVER had, but it truly is decent. If you want to make espresso with this pot, you have to buy good espresso beans...I would definitely recommend it if you happen to be on a tight budget like I am :-)."
2,doesn't last well,"I loved the coffee (not 6 cups!) for the first few days. Then, the thing got harder and harder to clean and is now a smelly mess. I love the concept, but wish I'd get more than a week's good use out of it."
1,I GIVE UP,"I READ THE OTHER REVIEWS AND DECIDED TO BUY BASED ON THEM. GOT IT ABOUT A WEEK AGO AND WAS REAL DISAPPOINTED! MAYBE I'M USING THE WRONG COFFEE OR I'M BREWING IT TOO HOT. THE PROBLEM IS I CAN'T KEEP THE COFFEE FROM TASTING LIKE DIRT. IF ANYONE KNOWS WHAT I'M DOING WRONG, I'M EAGER TO LEARN. DON'T PASS ME OFF AS A LIGHT WEIGHT WHO CAN'T HANDLE REAL STRONG JAVA. I LIKE IT THICK AS LONG AS IT TASTES LIKE IT SMELLS. COME TO THINK OF IT, IT DOES SMELL GOOD, BUT THE FLAVOR IS KNAPPY!"
5,"For the money, well worth it","Easier than fancier espresso makers, the coffee tastes great, the thing itself is incredibly inexpensive, and best of all, you don't have to clean it if you don't want to. I haven't bothered to since I started using it, yet the coffee doesn't have any bitter or unpleasant taste to it."
5,Great lattes!!,"For only 20 dollars you can have a great espresso maching. My husband and I use this everyday for lattes. It makes the best! It is very easy to use and clean up. However, I am wondering where I can find replacement parts for this espresso maker. I need a new rubber ring and have not been able to find one. Does anyone have any suggestions?"
5,yummy waffles,"I have this waffle iron and I love it. I've never owned a waffle iron and wanted to try it out. After doing some research I decided on this one. It has a handy dial on the top to set the amount of cooking time for your waffles so they come out as dark or as light as you like them. It takes a few tries to get it just right but then you have perfect waffles every time. I've never had a problem with my waffles sticking. You have to rub the plates with oil when you first get it and then every time the waffles just pop right out. I had a problem with the batter oozing out of the side at first but after adjusting the amount of batter and technique of pouring it in, it was smooth sailing. For the batter that did manage to drip down the side, I just waited for it to dry and used my little plastic pan scraper and it came right off. One of my favorite features is the lock and the flat end so when you are done, you just close it and set it up on it's end. It fits nicely under the cabinet."
2,Don't buy it! (unless you like cleaning it),"I'm a waffle fanatic and have been searching for the perfect waffler. Our old waffler was a villaware and we loved it so we bought this one. My biggest complaint? Batter oozes out of the waffler, and BAKES on to the outside! You have to spend 20 minutes scraping the baked on batter out of the many nooks and crannies of this waffler. (and you still can't get it completely clean) It's a horrific design. As for baking waffles, they are so-so, making more of an american style waffle than a crispy one. They are very thick and bread-like. It takes 3-5 minutes to bake a waffle, but one waffle is enough for two people. I thought the waffle tone feature would be annoying, but it turned out to be wonderful - the waffler chirps softly like a bird when the waffles are done. I was surprised by this handy feature. But you'll spend too much time cleaning the dang thing for only so-so waffles (But note, I am biased against american style waffles)"
4,"decadent, decadent fun. Wickedness you can tap yer feet to.","First off, 'April Fools' is downright genius - it's comic dynamite. This album is wicked, perverse, offensive, entertaining, disgusting, fanciful, and ghoulishly delightful. This one is not quite as good as 'Only Right and Natural' - this one is too long and some of th songs meander out there a little too far. But overall, it's astounding."
3,Good Performance But Poor Battery,Had for 2 years. Worked okay then battery started to go. At this point it holds no charge. Battery impossible for non-technician to replace.
3,Good value for the price,"This rotary shaver does a good job shaving. It cuts close. However, the flimsy hinge can't keep the top on when cleaning the razor. And speaking of cleaning the razor, you can do it with water or without, but you have to do it every time you shave if you don't want a mess on your bathroom counter. If you don't, then the razor throws all those little shavings all over the place. That get's pretty annoying. Anyway, for $60, it's as good a razor as I've had."
3,Same as old Release but worse packaging,"The only issue I have with this release is that the original ""complete collection"" was released in a thinpak. This time around you have the same 5 discs but they come in a clam shell box all stacked on one spindle with nothing between the DVDs (Like the old computer game CDs used to come packaged in). Other than that they seem the same as the original complete collection."
5,Scrub a-Dub-Dub,"This traditional brush fits the hand well, as it is wrapped in rope, and doesn't slip when soapy. The bristles are firm, but soften when wet and soaped up. It is stimulating, yet relaxing, and does a fine job at cleaning. A must for my shower."
4,My Favorite Back Scrubber,"Great back scratcher and scrubber, I purchased because I couldn't find anything firm around my home and I like a brush to leave me feeling clean after my bath. This one does the job, it is almost perfect. I wish the handle was longer, but otherwise it is perfect."
1,Didn't like the item.,"I personally didn't like the item. Its still in my home somewhere. I only used twice, then I bought the other brush. Hope its helpful."
4,Along Came Love,"I fell in love with Carrie's characters from the start. While the beginning took a bit to get moving, the time was well spent getting to know Wes, Lauren and Toby. When the suspense kicked into full gear, the pages kept turning. And when I closed the book I had a story I could picture with a resolution I found satisfying and enjoyable."
2,Not what I wanted,"I bought this saw to replace this saw:Gerber 46048 Sportsman's Wood Saw, Coarseand I am very disappointed. This exchange-a-blade saw just refuses to cut through anything without binding on every other stroke. For some reason the teeth on the course blade get clogged very quickly with wood bits and the cutting performance takes a dive.I can compare it to the saw on myLeatherman 830685 Charge TTi with Nylon Sheath. I love the Leatherman charge TTi with a passion. But the saw is sub-par at best.This saw is just not what I was expecting. The previously mention saw that costs half what this one does, cuts easily 3 times better than this one. I will be buying another one of the cheaper Sportsman's saws and probably giving this one to some homeless camper."
5,Better,I think this is a very helpful book for those suffering with psorisis and other ailments. Cleaning out your liver with diet and other methodologies makes sense and is effective for psorisis. Thank you for this book.
1,Broke after the second use!,"I bought this to make sausage. Since the 320 hp engine is stronger than most competing products, I figured it would be a more reliable product. Boy, was I wrong.I was finishing up my second batch of sausage with this unit when it broke. (My batches are only a few pounds each, so it's not as if this was a big load.) The motor kept running but the feed screw wasn't turning.I actually opened up the housing to see if it was something I could fix. It turns out that the mechanism uses these cheap plastic gears, and one of them had broken a tooth! What's the point of a 320 hp engine if the plastic gears break that easily?Their warranty information doesn't even include a phone number, so I have no idea how long repairs will take. But judging from the shoddy construction, it'll probably be in for service a lot.Stay away from this one. You're better off with a lower-power grinder that's built well."
1,Facts,"This grinder worked fine for as long as it lasted. Unfortunately, it didn't last long before breaking. I contacted the Manufacturer (VillaWare) and was told this unit was no longer manufactured, they have no replacement parts, and all I could do is a ""google"" search in hopes of finding someone that might carry a cutting blade to fit this unit. A blade cannot be found. If you have a lot of money to spend on a grinder go ahead and get this one in the hopes it will work because if it doesn't you'll be s.o.l."
2,VillaWare has no repair facilities!,"I've had this grinder for over a year. It is now out of warranty, though it's been used very few times. I've had problems grinding sinewy meat (as I just read, I'm not the only one), but this weekend the feeder screw stopped spinning for no apparent reason. The motor works, the thing inside the motor unit spins, but when everything is assembled, nothing spins!I called Villaware's customer service and all the girl could tell me is that they have no authorized repair facility in the US and I'd have to take it to a local repair shop. Sounds like a company that doesn't value customer retention to me! The girl was nice, but the solution wasn't."
1,not working,"it doesn't work, and there is not manufacture's phone number I can contact. it is very bad experience buying on line!!"
2,Not quite up to it.,"While the VillaWare 5265-05 has an acceptable appearance and acceptable accessories, a serious deficiency is the plastic auger. Many competitive units have metal augers which are far more durable. After grinding partially frozen fish, shrimp, spinach and meat, the auger was seriously deformed and was unusable. This was after less than 2 hours use. I have tried to get replacement parts but the internet site seems to be hard to find. In the newer models, the plastic auger has been replaced with a metal auger. This is a MUST. I'm hoping that Villaware will replace the defective plastic auger as a warranty items since their replacement with a metal auger is an implicit acknowledgement that the original auger was not up to the job. With a metal auger, I would rate the unit 4-5 stars since other components are quite good. Chuck Jensen"
2,DON'T BE CONFUSED~!!!!,"There is an item IDENTICAL to this one, but made by Oriental Company called TASIN. If you are expecting commercial quality, and the most powerful electric meat grinder, go with TASIN. It has 1200 WATT MOTOR POWER. It will grind just about everything from deer, elk, whole chicken with bones and nuts. TS-108 SUPER GRINDER is what you want. For some reason people put different lable on it, and advertise/sell wrongly. KEY is MOTOR POWER, not ELECTRIC USAGE. Why pay the same or more when you can get much more powerful, long lasting commercial quality meat grinder that can take a lot more ""punishment""????"
4,False Skorpion.... yeow!,"This relatively unremarkable EP owes it's existence & importance to False Skorpion, apparently a Wowee Zowee outtake.It would've been great right after Half a Canyon."
3,The Lebanon Don,"I purchased the ""Treasury of Khalil Gibran"" for two reasons: ""Satan"" and the ""Prophet"". Khalil short stories and poems are as much enlightening as they are entertaining."
3,Gund Snuffles bear,"Bear was smaller than I expected. The bear was deformed. One arm was bigger than the other arm. Other than that, soft and cute."
5,Keep An Eye on this Writer!,This writer has the ability to write down on paper what I've always thought. A great short story that had me from the first page and that's not easy to do.
2,Glad I read Untouchable first,"I loved Untouchable so very much that upon finishing it, I immediately checked to see what else he had written. I liked Wolves, I just didn't love it. Quite honestly, it didn't make much sense to me. Wasn't sure what was real and what was fantasy. Glad I read Untouchable first, don't know that Wolves would have made me seek this author out."
3,"When I was a lad, this read was quite captivating","I would rate it 3.5 STARS.I was merely 14 when I read the book in Roumanian. The plot was quite interesting, even Sherlock Holmes-like. The read feels very Jules Verne, but the plot nay. I remember at the beginning of the book, the descriptive details of the Transylvanian country and mountain side were very close to reality (Transylvania is a region in Roumania). Even for a young lad, who found the story captivating, the story was quite un-believable from early on. The spooky, mysterious, and metaphysical events that take place are all demystified at the end of the novel.Enjoy the read!"
2,poor craftsmanship,The table part went together fine but the drawers did not. Screw holes were not lined up and after much effort abandoned the drawers completely and I bought some fabric baskets to use in place of them. I would not buy this product again.
3,NOT SURE TUBE WAS FULL,"I first discovered this product two years ago, it was a free sample with a Ped Egg, and I could never find it in the store. I was pleased to find it on amazon.com. because it really works great, but the tube didn't feel like it was full, it's not possible to see through the tube and I feel like I got ripped off. I'll continue to lokk for this product in stores, so I can check the tube before purchase"
5,Me and My Son use it,"My son has inherited my problem feet. They get stinky and really dry. I bought this for his use (he's 12 months and has not had problems with use of this) as his feet are covered with bandaging over his oxygen saturation monitor probe and so extra prone to stinkiness every day. Well, I couldn't resist and tried some on my super dry winter feet and appreciated the result. It isn't high on the ""menthol effect"" but mainly I wanted to see if my feet retained moisture and developed less cracks. I noticed an effect after 3ish applications and don't have to apply it every day to maintain.I came back to purchase the 8oz as the 4oz is fine for my son but wouldn't last long enough with applications to adult sized feet.I had looked around and found lots of odor control powders but not many creams so was sold on having a lotion and am glad it works. It's a tad pricey, but watch sizing as the 8oz isn't much more than the 4oz currently.- Beth (Nick's Wife)"
3,Eh... I don't know why the review are so high,"With such high reviews on amazon, I purchased this lotion expecting it to really do wonders on my dry feet. It's really not that special. In the past, I've come across foot lotions that, in just one or two nights, completely make my serious calluses go away and make my feet look brand new. However, this lotion only goes as far as any 'average' lotion. Even when I left it on overnight repeatedly, with socks, it doesn't measure up to some of the other foot products I buy. The lotion is nice and thick, but it doesn't absorb as fast as some others and does barely anything for those thick calluses on the bottom of the heel. I wasn't impressed and will not buy this ever again."
4,Does the trick,This product is very good. Helped to heal my already dry and cracked feet. Highly recommended for night and morning use.
2,Doesn't work,"My wife said that it Doesn't work as She thought. You're going to need more than one Lotion if You want to heal your damage feet, and a several patience, time or a Physician."
1,No show,"I am still waiting delivery from the supplier and it was ordered on 11 APRIL 2011, was sent USPS and was never delivered and then was told by MEDICAL FOR YOU that they would resend UPS and they sent me a tracking number! Well according to the trackin number the parcel has never seft the supplier!So would love to review, but then what would IMiracle of Aloe Miracle Foot Repair Creambe reviewing . . . .??Miracle of Aloe Miracle Foot Repair Cream"
1,I never got my package....,I ordered 4 Miracle Foot Repair Cream's and I never received them.... I truck my package and it shows that I received it on July 8.... which never happened I already left message for Post Office Police. Where is my package??? Grazyna Gorczyk
5,Oh the memories..,"This may not be a new jazzy 3D computer game, but I can honestly say it was my favorite computer game ever - the entire King's Quest series is fabulous. It's interesting, challenging adventure puzzles, a great story line, and the animation is very nice even for the time."
3,MISSING,"Except for NOT having an adjustable temperature control, a feature I was counting on, this waffle iron works well. The only other waffle iron I have bought in the past, that I liked, had this feature and I could make crisp waffles on a regular basis. Using the Villaware, and my standard recipe, my first waffle comes out limp. I will have to learn how to add more time for warmup and for cooking. The handy warning beep comes too early. The technical specifications listing clearly states 'adjustable temperature control' and should be corrected, so others are not misled."
1,bad,"the fact that this book is called ''the greatest joke book ever'' makes me itch. this may actually be the worst joke book ever. sure, there are a few gems here and there but 99 percent of the ''jokes'' are not jokes at all. for every good joke you find, you waste about 10 minutes reading through the useless garbage that is the majority of this book."
2,The Unsuitable Joke Book,I thought the book would have more material that I could use with preteens.
5,A weighty text based on the curriculum guidelines of the IGDA,"Any library serious about catering to computer game developers will find the weighty, extensive updated second edition of Introduction to Game Development to be a key acquisition. It is divided into seven independent sections, each featuring articles written by experts in their field, and covers all the basics of game design, programming languages and physics, audio visual design, and more. The editor is a software engineer at Nintendo: his professional background lends to an outstandingly well detailed survey of the entire field of game programming."
3,Probally a Good Classroom Text,"This is a good book introducing game programming. It is massive, trying to cover almost every essential aspect of game programming. This book would be a great supplemental text, along with another code specific book, for a two-semester game programming class. If you are a newbie looking for a quick way to learn basic game programming techniques on your own, this book is probaly not for you. (Not that there is truly a quick way.) It is a long read with little code. Let me make it clear this is a good book worth reading: it is just not the quick and dirty introduction that I was looking for. I suggest a step-by-step type book that offers a working game at the end, along with this book."
3,More like intro to game management...,"This is a very useful book with respect to tying the elements of a game together as well as giving a broad outline of game program flow. It highlights necessary business considerations toward completing the final product.Sadly, as a programming book, it falls short of the mark with respect to teaching any programming code. It aludes to examples on the included CD but does not explain concepts covered in the code.This book is useful to a person who already has a strong programming background who is looking for ways to tie things up and market their final product. For a person who is looking for a tutorial for programming games, I would look somewhere else."
1,Waste of Money,I have read this book. Nothing genuine about this book! The content has no difference than that of any textbooks. I threw this book in the trash can. I don't want to resell it because I don't want to waste other people's money and time.
4,Comprehensive book,"This book is a nice effort to give the reader an overview of the physical and metaphysical aspects of the sedona vortices. It includes great descriptions of the differing points of view on the vortex pheonomenon. On the down side, this book is kind of a tease -- it could be about three times as long. It is clear from the book that the author is very knowledgable. I wish he would have shared more of this knowledge. The author gave a good overview but left the reader wanting more. References would also be nice."
5,Nice book,This is a very good little book about Sedona and shamanism in general. I recommend this book to anyone who has been or plans on visiting Sedona or anyone interested in shamansim and energy vortexes. Great overview of vortexes and medicine wheels.
3,Strange but good,"I ordered this video as Robert Dante is one of the well known whip crackers in America. There is a wealth of information on whips and how to crack them, but some very strange stuff to go along. First of all is Robert Dante's clothes. My roommate said he is wearing suspended MC Hammer pants. This is correct. Also Mr Dante takes a very strange breath each time he snaps the whip. Very strange. There are some strange S&M sequences, which I found to odd to be entertaining. The informational parts of the video are really great for any beginning whip cracker (age of consent)."
4,Mint nobodies,This is a good album by a band which I'm sure not many people know of. If you really want to be a music buff expand your horizons and check out less popular bands starting with this one. KEEP MUSIC ALIVE......MINT!
4,Just minor problems with this,"This mount works as advertised. The only problem I had was that the mounting holes did not allow me to bolt the unit directly into 16"" spaced studs so I had to use a drywall anchor. While the holes would allow such placement, the unit itself would have been offset from the center of the wall to accomplish this. A minor complaint, surely but enough to warrant one less star."
4,Installing on a Brick Fireplace,"I purchased the Peerless ST650 to mount my 46"" Sony LCD to my fireplace brick face. The installation went well and the TV looks GREAT!!The instructions covered normal stud framing, metal studs and concrete block. It was dificult to find anyone online or otherwise to speak to installing on brick. I finally spoke with a friend who does high end audio/video installations and he said that although I may be fine with attaching it only to the brick he recommeded going all the way through the brick and attaching to a stud or 2x4 across several studs which is what I did."
2,not a long-lasting product,"This press worked pretty well for about a year. It definately keeps your coffee warmer than a regular press, where the coffee is cold almost before you've had a chance to pour it. I eventually got over the fact that the ""chrome"" is plastic, not metal. But I am disappointed in the fact that after about a year of use, the bottom broke on the press. It appears to have just fallen off for no apparent reason. I treated this thing well - handwashing, etc. It did allow me to take the whole thing apart and analyze its construction, which is far from sophisticated."
4,A Story of Forgotten People,"Jeff has done a magnificent job of researching the subject, the Negro Seminoles. He has sifted through many scraps of evidence to come up with a 300 year history that has never been documented."
1,Garbage,"It is incredible how they trust blindly in EVERY aspect of General Relativity. Space-time warpages and singularities happens ONLY in mathematics! There is no way out. It is funny how Scientific American gives credibility to such a kind of science-fiction. It is time to stop lying to the public!Hawking and Thorne, grasp it: Time-travel is physically IMPOSSIBLE."
4,Very good flashlights for the money.,Very good flashlights for the money. Nice white light with long live for batteries. Would be very nice to have the water resistant.
4,big and durable,"They are pretty big. The big one is huge. The small one is nice, a good size for everyday use. The buld is bright when used with new batteries. Good construction overall."
4,Great inexpensive flashlights,For the money this pair of flashlights was a great buy. Everyone always needs a flashlight. I managed to get these for $5 a while back through Amazon and grabbed them up. They both are very bright with good rubber grips. I've used them around the garage and on a camping trip. The kids love to play with them and so far have not damaged them in any way. So far so good. I have several very expensive flashlights and for basic function these hold up just as well. for the money it's hard to beat.
3,OK to buy this,I bought this set for $5. They are good but not worth than 2-3bucks. Just like ordinary flashlights.
2,Winchester Flashlights are ordinary.,"These are functional tools, but I was somewhat disappointed in the quality of these flashlights. They are plastic with an overdone rubber outer covering."
3,Seeking Salamanca Mitchell,Jasper continues to show growth in his writing skills with this effort about an inner city young man who gets caught up in the fast life and his love for the lady who sticks by him through it all. More of the same thug-lite. Get it from the library.
3,Good and not so good!,"My DVD skips during my exercise, this is not good! It messes up my timing and the time I have available for exercise.What I do like is the first 30 minutes of Jari's new routine! But the rest of this DVD is from her previous videos."
2,?!,"I love Jari Love videos. I would get every other Jari Love video 5 stars. I just got the DVD, and I can find one dancey weight routine and the Body Rock weight routine that I already owned. There just AREN'T three 30 minute workouts on this disk. I will do the dancey routine at some point, but was really looking for 3 30 minute routines, as described. If I had known it was one more dancey routine and one I owned, I wouldn't have purchased this.In addition, the Body Rock routine is lower quality video than on the Body Rock DVD, and doesn't have chapter divisions. I had to pop this one out and replace it with the Body Rock DVD to finish my workout.If you are interested in Jari Love, buy every earlier DVD, but skip this one."
3,"Seller great, product mediocre","First off, the seller was prompt in package and delivery and the price was right. I am an avid follower of Jari Love's workouts(I LOVE them), but was disappointed with the attempt at a ""dance"" workout. Might be right for some...just found it boring."
4,I WAS SURPRISED,"I know her workouts are hard. I was prepared to muddle through another workout just doing what I was able to do while the instructors hopped and jumped, but this one is just right for me. Its being called ""dancey"" but it really isn't dancey, because there are no steps to learn like other dancey videos. If you can two step and grapevine, you got it. The music on here is very good, the participants are all on cue and look good, PLUS they are not the girlie fashion model types, they are very toned women. So that said, I love this DVD. Why not five stars?? because there is floor work and I can't get down there."
5,no more eggos,"i have this waffle iron and love it. i'd always been a bit intimidated by the thought of making my own waffles, but this waffle iron is extremely easy to use and the tone that sounds when the waffles are done is great. perfect waffles every time. and the nonstick surfaces make it really easy to clean."
5,It's won my heart,"It is a wonderful machine, and it's here at a great price. I found the recipe booklet useful. I prefer using butermilk in place of regular milk. (Make your own by adding two tablespoons of white vinegar to two cups of milk and let it rest for 5 min. or so) The weight of the metal cover of the machine keeps it closed during cooking, and it's just gorgeous to look at. A well made machine, and I'm purchasing one for a friend...it's so gifty."
5,Not Your Grandmother's Waffle Iron,"I'd loved my grandmother's homeade waffles as a kid, but I was scared of making them on my own. I've little cooking experience but even I can handle this appliance. It's auto light and auto temperature control make it easy to turn out perfect waffles every time. The nonstick grids also help them to come out perfectly and also make it a breeze to clean. Overall, it's a wonderful product. The waffles you make turn out delicious everytime and are so simple to make and clean up next to nothing. I've already purchased several as wedding gifts, and all who have recieved them have been pleased."
2,"Decent waffle, deafening shriek","I have to agree with a previous reviewer who compared the shrieking tone of the Villaware's ""Done Alarm"" to a smoke detector. The waffle seemed good enough, but my heart was racing and adrenaline flowing from the alarm. I'd recommend this product if you tend to wander outside or to a neighbor's house while you're baking your waffle (not a recommended practice, in any case)."
3,Great Shape for Other Uses,"I've owned this waffle iron for a few years. My only complaint is that the cooking range is on the light side. The middle of the range delivers a waffle that is quite light and not crispy. I find that if I use a more done setting and then put the waffles in an oven to finish and to keep warm, then it's better.I've used the waffle iron to make corn meal waffles and then served the sections with guacamole as an hor-d'ouvre. Because of the shape it is great for lots of things. Using the sections for ice cream or fruit is also good.So I recommend it although getting it to make the perfect waffle takes practice."
4,Fantastic waffle maker!,The VillaWare heart shaped waffle maker is fantastic! My family really enjoys the heart shaped waffles. Kids of all ages will be impressed by looks of your waffles and clean up is simple. One of the best investments I've made! I highly recommend this waffle maker.
2,Waffles are too thin / flat,"As a romantic, I purchased this heart shaped waffle maker. The flaw is that the waffles come out too flat, with not enough indentation and texture. The waffles were more pancake-like than waffle-like."
5,the most coherent thesis I've ever read,"I've read many a book on Jesus, Christianity, and the Bible since 1976 through a myriad of sources from fundamentalism to liberalism and even New Age, and have found this book to contain the most satisfying explanations of the development of life and of the existence of evil I've ever read. Dr. Kelly builds his case so thoroughly, and comes up with an hypothesis dazzling in its simplicity. A must-read for all!"
3,just okay,"I bought this book for my wife. It turned out not to have many pictures that shock or awe. For real fashion at the edge, I recommend fruits and fresh fruits, shots of Tokyo street style."
2,Dictionary?,"Reads like a dictionary. Not very helpful, unless you want to look up a term or technique."
5,Excellent !,"A handy book of Tips and Tricks, just as the title says. Keep it on hand because you will use it alot. Every .NET developer should have this book. At slightly over 100 pages, it is concise and easy to navigate."
4,A very helpful reference book,"IDE plays a big role in .NET programming. I have 4 years .NET experiences but still cannot remember all useful IDE features up front. Like how to deploy a ASP.NET web application using Visual Studio, how to switch between code view and design viewer(makes you look more professional in front of your boss). This book gives out quick and easy tips to dig out IDE usage for VS 2003 and 2005. This also help me work more efficiently. I would recommend it to be a must have desktop reference at office."
2,Not as helpful as I thought,More or less someones personal notes in book form. Too pricey for the size of the book. I would not recommend it.
2,"Nice sound, but still too flaky","Very flaky intonation with these strings, couldn't get any of my guitars to stay in tune with these. Loved the way they felt, loved the way they sounded, hated the way they intonated and keeping any guitar strung with these was a pain in the neck. I tried for a year, multiple batches, I won't spend money on DRs again. I went with GHS Nickel strings and haven't had any problems."
3,Pretty Damn Good,"With her childlike voice sounding out hushed syllables, Irish fairy Bronagh Slevin's phrasing is familiar, yet exotic. She incarnates these twilight songs with a lullaby lilt. For those of you who are 1)unwilling to empty your ENTIRE wallet on this cd and are 2)into triphop and always looking for other really good artists in this narrow genre, pick up the 2001 compilation, She: A Female Triphop Experience. It has 2 of the best cuts from the Bloom disc, plus a score of other scintillating and almost impossible to find Triphop artists! AWith her childlike voice sounding out hushed syllables, Irish fairy Bronagh Slevin's phrasing is familiar, yet exotic. She incarnates these twilight songs with a lullaby lilt."
5,Crustation - Bloom,"One of the hidden classics of trip-hop, Crustation's Bloom is a deliciously dubwise album, full of shuffling beats and dreamy qualities. ""Purple"" injects a bit of pop peppiness into the proceedings, but the majority of the tracks take a darker route. ""Face the Waves"" and ""Down Down"" are like half-heard memories that you recall just as you wake up. Certainly, much of the album's charm can be attributed to the lullaby-like vocals of Bronagh Slevin. Whether singing or speaking, Slevin's Scottish burr provides a hazy focal point for the equally misty music. ""Flame"" is a twisted love song, while ""Ride On"" is a fairy-tale dirge, sad and moody. It's an overlooked gem, to be sure."
5,AMAZING ALBUM,"Bronagh Slevin has a wonderful voice, and the lyrics are incredible as well. Although the entire CD is awesome, my faves are ""Life as One"" and ""Flame"". If you can find a copy of this CD, buy it and share it with others! In Fleabay you will find a few singles from the album, but the entire CD is a rare find indeed."
2,Great idea; poor transferrability,"My son took Algebra I in eighth grade and did quite well. He then started at a high school that used this program, and went through the first two books in one year. He got top grades, was great applying the principles to physics, even history and literature. But then we moved and he had to transfer to a ""traditional"" math program, was placed in Algebra II and is failing. Now they're recommending he re-take Algebra I. He's devestated. Anyway: if you or your kid is in this program: stay in it! It's difficult to transfer out once you're in. See the other reviews, too."
3,Beautiful but boring,"The best thing about this recording is the MARVELOUS sound of the harpsichord/recording. It has a gentle, silvery quality that you keep wanting to come back to.Indeed, I often find myself coming back to this recording ... and each time is somehow like a blank page. Gilbert's interpretations do not leave a lasting impression, and least not for me.On the good side, he's not eccentric and I appreciate his relaxed tempos. Gilbert is also a master at his instrument, as regards attack and technique ... But it all just sounds so predictable once the tempo is set. My mind starts to wonder in each fugue, even if I'm following with the score. I think I enjoy the cd more when I'm using it as background noise.It's not BAD Bach, by any means. I can see why many people would adore this cd precisely because of its beautiful sound and straightforward approach. I just don't find it very exciting."
5,Mini-dictionary of Freshwater Fishes - Recommeded!,"This book is small in size and light in weight. I think this book is good for you to carry outward, especially for you to shop around the aquarium shops. But don't think that small in size or light in weight is ""EQUAL"" to ""thin content"", at least I don't think so. This book have RICH CONTENTS and give me a fast guide for most of freshwater fishes, which may be useful for you to determine which fishes you can bought to your home. Price is also acceptable. Overall I recommened this book for leisure purpose."
5,Sweet Book Indeed!,"This is a superb freshwater aquarium book to have; every freshwater aquarium keeper owes it to himself or herself to get this one. It's packed with a lot of pertinent information on water temperature ranges, water types, care, habits, compatibility, etc. There are a lot of superb photographs that are a joy to explore. Walt Whitman once stated that he liked the feel of a good compact book that one could really get close to; well this is the one for freshwater aquarium buffs. Plenty of good reading with excellent photos! The plastic book cover is a nice touch to this fine paperback!"
3,Not too bad,An OK book that is very brief in its details of fish species and occasionally slightly inaccurate with regards compatibilities. Very nice pictures that get it an additional star from me just because they make species identification a lot easier than some of other books. It has a nice plastic cover for those times when you're reading and dripping at the same time and is handily pocket sized for taking to the shops with you.
3,Handy but it's just a piece of wire,"I bought this bit of bent wire to hold a roll of paper towels and I was too lazy to make my own. It works, and I'm glad I bought it but you can live without it. If you have a park bike rack and work on chains and other messy stuff it's handy to not have to handle the paper towel roll to get a sheet off it when your hands are all covered with stuff."
5,Simple and helpful,"You would expect something this simple to do the job well, and it does. Though referenced as a paper towel holder, it would also work just fine as a rag holder for shop rags."
3,It's a towel roll holder,"It is a towel roll holder. A little pricey for the bent round stock that it is, but I do like it though. It saves me time cleaning my hands not having to look around to find where I put my towels."
1,We got a Lemon,"We bought the Villaware toaster based on reviews six months ago...and we can find nothing positive to say about it. The bottom quarter of a slice of bread doesn't toast leaving you with a pretty unappealing piece of toast. Now, one side of the toaster refuses to stay down. We can do very little toasting for the price of this toaster! A real clunker."
1,Very poor performance.,"I bought this toaster based off of the positive reviews here on Amazon. Out of the box it seemed kind of junky with dings in the metal case as well as flimsy knobs and buttons. I was expecting a tank of a toaster but got something that looks nifty but performs poorly.The light-touch knobs make keeping the bread down a problem. And when one side pops up, the other does too in response even though the settings are different.I'm not quite sure what the purpose of the switch is for this toaster. It's not like it is being put into a ""standby mode"" or anything.And the biggest problem is that the toaster doesn't toast evenly from both sides of the bread. That's unaceeptable."
1,I LOVED this Toaster - - While it worked - Hate the Co.,"This toaster worked for me just long enough to get past the warranty. I called and pleaded for repair or replacement and they basically took the attitude: ""Too bad for you, You're out of warranty"". Not even a consolation coupon. Unhelpful CSR who made it clear she didn't care what I thought about Villaware. Beware! If your item fails, you'll be out in the cold."
1,Poor Quality and Flaky Company,The left side stopped working slightly less than a year old (one year warranty). I have submitted numerous emails to the company and get an automatic reply that says no text was included in the email. I think this is a bogus company.
2,Pretty but pretty flawed,"It has plenty of wattage and a sort of utilitarian beauty to it, but it has a few problems. I opened up the box and found a screw at the bottom and couldn't find the place where it had fallen from (suggesting that their quality control could be improved). The toasting was also quite uneven for such an expensive appliance that takes quite a bit of counter space. I think Villaware could make a product that has a bit more robust construction given its solid heft and size. Disappointing."
2,Dying young,"It's a lovely looking thing: oh so shiny; nifty curves, neat knobs (and a convenient crumb drawer and wide slots). But its beauty is fleeting, and only skin deep, I've discovered. My toaster (a slightly different model, but essentially the same as this one) is, alas, but a youth, and is already dying and nearly dead. Its filaments are giving out: it partly toasts, partly doesn't; its settings aren't reliable. I'm annoyed that I spent this much money on a toaster that is giving out so soon. For the price, this thing ought to last at least a decade, maybe two."
4,The New York Yankees of Toasters,"A while ago, I received this toaster in the mail from a friend who goes to a college too far away for me to ever see him in person. A toaster seemed to be an uncanny present: something that noone knew you needed but you did. This thing makes good use of the phrase ""Out with the old and in with the new"". The Villaware 5850 Classic 4-Slice Toaster seems to be complient with the 21st century with it's updatings. It is very fast and not very much in the way. It fits what people need in the kitchen: it matches with everything, and it seems to be strong as an ox. I have spilled coffee in it several times, but nothing ever gets damaged, unlike my past toasters. I never thought that I toaster could be so convenient. Any microwave out there is second to this toaster. It's just head and shoulders, the best thing that I have seen for my kitchen. It's expensive, but it'll last you a lifetime."
1,Good looks is all you get !,"The only good thing I can say about this toaster is that if you have the space for it, it looks sensational. Unfortunately, the performance would not impress anyone. We were first surprised to find out that not only did our bread not fit in the slots, but most importantly, it toasts one side dark and the other almost not at all. This did not improve after a few days of operation so we sent back the toaster."
1,Caveat Emptor,"When I purchased this unit I thought it was a low-cost alternative to the Dualit, which I had coveted for many years. However, looks can and are deceiving. This thing is a piece of junk. I should have sent it back when I first got it as it does not toast uniformly and has little power, often requiring two cycles for decent-sized bagels. Now, 1.5 years later, a toasting wire inside just snapped, essentially making it a two slice toaster now. I only give it one star as that is the lowest rating this system allows."
1,What a waste!,"I, too, received a defective one that I exchanged. Should have gotten the message then. The second one had the same problems that Paul S. Ripley of Irvine, CA had. I wish now that I had returned that one as well, but I was sick of the whole thing! We are using it. The only time that the center piece of toast gets toasted on both sides is when 4 slices are done at a time - which isn't every day. I wish I had gone with my gut feeling and gotten the Kitchenaid - even though it is just a 2-slicer. Oh well, this was a [amt] lesson in futility!"
1,Total Dud,The first one I received didn't work and had to be returned. Total hassle. The second one stopped working after about 18 months. Total rip-off.
1,awful product,"These gloves are too big, have no stretch, come off my hands-useless! they are inferior to other gloves I have used by a mile."
1,So disappointing. Junk!,We got this because we love making smoothies and shakes. We used it a couple times and then the spout broke. We managed to plug it and continue to use it. Then it started to leak through the bottom. We maybe used it 10-15 times. We just got a 1970's blender for $2 at a yard sale and it totally kicks butt compared to this one. I wouldn't recommend the VillaWare Smoothee Blender to anyone. We were really disappointed in it.
4,Well it is an awesome gift... but....,"You know that infomercial for these things (The one where they are knocking the blender)? That guy in the infomercial is way too excited about the spigot. I have had this thing for almost two months and I haven't used that thing once. It is actually a pain(...)to clean it out, even though I don't use it. I make a lot of smoothies and protein shakes and both are WAY to thick to get through that little spigot.The good:Heavy blades.700 watt motor.And if you're going to use the spigot, there is actually pretty good clearence from the drip plate.""The good"" presupposes a ""bad"", and there really isn't anything bad about it other than the minor difficulty of cleaning out the spigot. It works as an awesome blender, but if you want to make anything thicker than water, a blender is all that it is."
1,don't waste the money,I bought one of these for myself as I have a smoothee everyday. It was great at first...so I bought my parents one. About 2 weeks into it the seal around the drink dispenser broke. I tried contacting vila ware and kept getting that the part was out of stock. Well after 2 months of trying I finally gave up. When I asked my family about theres they said the motor died on them. Luckily I had the base on mine and it worked fine so not too bad...I spent money for two blenders and ultimatly only had one.
3,Regional Wild Perennials,"This looks like an excellent guide to seed collection and propagation. However it is highly specific to the southeast and I am looking for the high desert in Oregon. I could glean some information on mallows and yarrow, but although penstamons were mentioned they weren't discussed. I think a general recommendation for this type of book is to highlight the region that it covers."
4,An album that need to be hear more than twice,"This album, i admit is not the best of maiden but it sounds different since it's paul d'ianno who sing (you must admit that he is reaaly good, not as much as bruce but still...), but as being a maiden fan i heard it often and it propose a lot of different style, two instrumental song (wich are real cool), fast drumming guitar flamming song (purgatory), the album self titled song (killers) which is kinda ""off-tempo"", and finally ""murders in the rue morgue"" woh!! cool. A must into any maiden fans..."
2,"Luckily,Diannos last","this is my least favourite maiden album,and luckily,the band soon changed vocalist.none of the tracks are stunning,and it is an anti-climax after such a good debut album.i like the cover art though!"
5,perfect,"I ordered this table for a Christmas party to put buffet style food on. It was the perfect size! In fact I ordered two and had an eight foot long buffet table. I put a Christmas print tablecloth over it and it looked so cute! I had plenty of room for everything and it was just the right size. It is very sturdy and folds up flat for easy storage. I love it!!! Oh yeah, one more thing, I placed my order on Sunday, standard shipping and it arrived two days later on Tuesday! I was amazed!"
2,Just buy the real thing..,"It's really quite a good tribute album... EXCEPT.. there is no effort to actually make the songs anything better than one-off copies of the original tracks. If I am going to listen to a tribute/cover album, I expect it to offer interesting and intillegent reinterpretations of the original material. These are nicely produced covers with a good ""fake"" Tori singing. The inflections, orchestrations, and general feel is all quite good.. but why wouldn't you just buy the real thing instead? Disappointing next to the ""real"" recordings.."
5,"Was just as described, and I couldn't be happier.","The box of note cards was described as ""used"". The cards were all brand new, the only thing that looked a little tired was the box the notes came in. Considering I saved more than half of the listed price of others, I was very happy with this order. Prompt shipment, well padded."""
5,Right Now I Feel Like a Bull in a China Shop,"In the spirit of objectivity, I will start with a disclaimer: This is my favorite album. Okay, with that large grain of salt dissolving in your pallate, know that it IS good, AND important. I feel it is one of the last true testaments to the 'rock' form that we Americans have to offer. Sad, sardonic, exapansive. Maybe a little uncomfortable, if not in length, certainly in content. But, mind you, it's beautiful. That's the key, don't you think: to be BEAUTIFUL. A person could write a damn thesis about this album, and maybe someone should."
2,Not again...,"A few days ago I overheard some people talking about Silkworm and just gushing over about how great and under appreciated they were. I thought to myself ""Silkworm... weren't just they some run-of-the-mill indie band from about 10 years ago? Well, I slept on the Pixies and My Bloody Valentine, maybe I slept on these guys too. Better check 'em out."" Five minutes of research told me that the consensus is that Firewater is their best album, so I bought a copy and listened to it.There's a new winner of the ""Man, Pavement Is So Awesome, Let's Have Our Band Sound Like Pavement"" award. One of the most impressively blatant rip-offs I've ever heard. Sure, all bands have their influences and if you listen carefully you can often pick them out. But this, this is borderline plagarism. I want my $9 and my 59 minutes back. And I want to hunt down those people I overheard and slap them. But, what would Jesus do? He'd hand them each a copy of Slanted and Enchanted."
4,Looks Great,"Gauge looks really nice, but I haven't located anyplace to install the sensor on my tractor"
4,Great waffles (once you figure out the quirks),"We've made batches and batches of waffles since receiving our waffler. They have always come out great!! All we had to do was understand our tempermental new toy. The instructions tell you that the waffle is done when you hear the tone, we wait for the second tone. Yes, it's loud and annoying, but hey, you can walk away, fold a load of laundry and come back at the second call. ;) Other than that it is a great addition to our household."
5,Great wedding present,I did not register for this waffle iron but received it as a wedding gift and I am so glad I did! I come from a waffle loving family and the Villaware 3000 is so much better than anything we've ever used. We have friends and family over for brunch and they love our waffles - they come out a perfect crisp medium brown every time and any extra waffle residue is easy to clean. I love that the beeper knows the perfect amount of time to cook so we can work on other breakfast cooking while the waffles are going. My parents liked it so much they just ordered one for their brunches. For waffle lovers I would definately recommend!
2,"Very annoying ""Waffle Tone""","The waffler has a tone that indicates when the iron is hot and when the waffle is done. It's very loud and it's probably the most annoying tone in the world. There's no surprising someone with breakfast in bed. In fact, you might toss it out the window before you're finished making waffles.Other than that, it works great. But I really can't stand the noise."
2,Dissapointing,"I found this book dissapointing, because it puts to great an emphasis on Clara Pettacci his mistress. Furthermore the emphsis is on mainly on the romantic while a biography of such an important political figure should have at least stressed the damage which the Petacci family caused the regime. They took full advantage of the relations with Mussolini to become one of the main elements in the corruption that was one of the features of the Fascist regime in its last years."
2,Duce! is a Dud!,"I didn't enjoy reading this book. To start off with, you learn nothing of Mussolini's background. We find him in the beginning of the book as a leader. Nothing is told of the political and economic climate in Italy. How did the blackshirts come to be? The dialog offered does nothing to enhance a readers knowledge of Mussolini and what made him tick. This book started out flat, and it ended the way it started.I did find one thing that fascinated me. For all the images and videos we have of Mussolini with all his pomp and arrogance, at the end of this book we find him weeping in regret for the things he had done and wondering if he could find forgiveness. What a tragic life... and to see how he ended up.(Verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity.)Psalm 39:5 KJV"
3,good luck with your rebate,"still wating after almost 6 months... called twice and was answered by someone i bet is from india (with all the call centers job moving to india, i wasn't surprised)... told me that the rebate is ""vaild"" but don't know why the rebate check hasn't send out yet... told me to ""wait few more weeks"" each time i called... will file a complaint to Federal Trade Commission if i don't get it soon... as to the quality of the product, you get for what you paid for it... which isn't bad if i EVER get my rebate check ([$$$] when i did this)..."
1,KOGI L7CH,"I received this monitor, and for the first 25 days it worked well, but suddenly the color went haywire, and the screen refused to be adjusted. Checking the product materials, I discovered there was no warranty info.I am now in the process of trying to contact Gvision/KOGI for warranty service - it's like going through hell!!"
3,Not bad for the money,"For this low price, the KoGi L7CH is a very decent 17"" LCD monitor. It won some kind of PC magazine award for its text and picture clarity, although I wish the contrast ratio were higher. Response time is also a bit on the high side, but again, this is a value monitor and a good choice if your budget is tight (and whose isn't these days?). The warranty is skimpy, so be sure to buy from a reputable store like Amazon just in case something goes wrong shortly after you purchase it. I bought two of these for clients and neither one had dead pixels."
4,"Good monitor, but 1 bad pixel","Just got my monitor. I like it in general, but it arrived with one dead pixel. Since amazon seems to have discontinued the product, the only alternative is to try my luck with the manufacturer. (...)"
1,Blacked out completely after a few months,"Off warranty, of course. It worked fine for several months then started looking pinkish for a couple of days then blacked out completely. Spend the money for a decent brand."
4,"Good Monitor, but Mac Users Beware","I bought this monitor to use with my OS X Macintosh. It worked just fine under 10.2.X but when I upgraded to 10.3 it began to cause problems. It has issues with some full-screen games in 10.3 where the resolution is allowed to be set ""out of range"" rendering the monitor blank. A quick force-quit brings everything back, but it makes the games unplayable. Not sure if it's the monitor or the system causing the problem. The monitor is otherwise very nice and provides a very fast refresh rate and is nice and bright.YMMV"
2,no es la mejor eleccion,"No es una cometa muy maniobrable, no responde bien ni en viento suave ni fuerte por lo que yo recomiendo buscar otro producto"
5,Spell-binding,"I read the ""the omega syndrome"" when it first came out. It's oneof the most thrilling end-times books on the market! And, I'veread nearly all of them! This book kept me spell_bound & notwanting to put it down! I have given it to 20 of my Friends andFamily as Christmas, & Birthday, & ""Just because I Love You""Gifts!! It is well written & you can tell that Mrs. Fleener hasdone her research Well!! Signed by Mary Lou & Charles Miller."
4,A suspenseful thriller into the future of Revelations,"When I first did the graphic layout of this book back in 1996, I was given the manuscript and was asked to read it. I was amazed in awe of the accurate detail of the book that tells of end time prophecy and how our world will be dominated by a ""one government"" society leaded by the Anti-Christ. In it's novel form the characters enact their story in a powerful portrayal of Biblical scriptures and actual modern day events as they unfold. The intensity to the climatic conclusion leave you wondering what will the devastation of a lost earth survive in the worst holocaust known to ever exist in all of written history. This book kept me reading through the night with the lights on. A good read to check out."
5,Insightful and unforgettable depiction of the end times,"A captivating storyline; a spectacle in good versus evil; a believable interpretation of Bible-told prophecy; exposing global trends manipulated by the Anti-Christ and his followers to ensnare the whole world in the repressive grip of his power. The climax of the story, though predictable, is triumphant in Christ's victorious return. The name of the game? WE WIN!"
4,An awesome and believable treatment of our future.,"When I read this book, I was so overwhelmed by the possibilities and plausibility of an end-time scenario painted so graphically in my mind by this author, I was stunned. After the first fifty pages, I could not put it down until I had consumed the entire story. Spellbound, I read the book in one sitting, though it took me into the wee hours of the morning."
5,excelente,para mi es la mejor marca en lentes de sol'tanto por la variedad de modelos y la calidad del cristal
3,RayBan,I was able to procure this original Ray Ban sunglasses through Amazon at much lower price than what is available in the retail outlet.
1,small parts warning,"I do not own this item, but am passing on information that a neighbor just had to perform the Heimlich maneuver on her preschooler to remove the red cylinder from his throat. Let's be cautious, folks."
4,Cute wooden train,"My 16 month old fell in love with trains after staying in a vacation hotel near a train yard. I thought this would be a great holiday toy for him, especially since we're ring to avoid bringing any more plastic toys into our home. I'm not sure if the train counts as a success. He likes watching Mommy & Daddy roll it around him, but quickly loses interest when he rolls it himself. I think this is probably because the cars are held together by magnets and fall apart pretty easily. Pushing a train with 4 cars is fun, but not so much fun if you have only one car within 15 seconds.The train is very well made though there are some small parts as other reviewers have indicated. I am very happy with the quality and durability of this toy. Perhaps my son needs to grow into it a bit more and learn to be more gentle in pushing it. In the meantime, it makes a bright and cheerful addition to his nursery."
5,First Christmas Gift,"Purchased this Lokmock train as a Christmas gift for my year old Grandson. He & his twin sister loved the bright colors. I loved the fact this train was made of quality materials, non-toxic paint and simple design with out any dangerous moving or removable parts. All my gifts to my 3 grandchildren were purchased with health and safety in mind for them and the environment."
3,Not what I expected,"This book was not quite what I expected. I thought I would hear of Rosie's rise to stardom, how she came to adopt children and even how she came to believe she is homosexual. I thought it would be about her finding her! Instead it takes you on her tale to be an unqualified pshycologist. A little sad and very dangerous for all involved.She does write a good story in an entertaining style but it was more an episode in her life. I am not sure I left the story with a clear ending. More I left feeling both individuals were very troubled. Sorry I like Rosie, she seems wonderful but I felt misled by the title"
3,I swear I've heard this story before,Rosie does an excellent job of revealing her heart and her loves even if she does have the writing talent of a 7th grader. The plot is interesting enough but while I was reading it I swore I had heard this story before. Then I realized where: _The_Night_Listener_ by Armistead Maupin.
4,Well Done,"I had watched Rosie on her show for years. I ( for one) knew she was a lesbian before she came out. We lesbians just know but...this book does not mention a thing about it. I laugh now, as I know everyone will. OHHH! Rosie's book is about her coming out and for publicity. WOW! They were all wrong. This is a heartfelt book about someones caring, giving and charitable ways, who happen to be famous in the eyes of everyone , except her. I see a person trying to help her humankind by just being a friend. I saw another side of Ro O'Donnell I really enjoyed reading about and I would love to just meet her on the street and ask her if she would like to sit down with my partner and I and have a beer. I liked this book, I couldn't put it down until I finished it. It's a Great Read !!"
2,I will spare you the trouble of reading it,"O'Donnell is contacted by a woman suffering from multiple personality disorder who pretends to be an abused, pregnant teenager who was raped by a youth minister. O'Donnell deeply identifies with her, which makes you wonder if she was molested by someone in her church. She ferociously bonds with this woman, even when she finds out the girl doesn't exist and the real woman is someone like her now. She still corresponds with this woman. This story is woven between scattered memories of her mother. We all lose our mother sooner or later, and the ones who lost her sooner suffer more, but you shouldn't drag it through the rest of your life like a crutch. Still, O'Donnell became rich and famous and can now support that crutch in grand style. Those of us not rich and famous just have to snap out of it. And that's it. It's not a biography because the glimpses of her journey to fame are too brief and disconnected. It's a depressing book."
5,Find Me ~ Rosie O'Donnell,"I could not put this book down. My profession is that of a Mental Health Professional, and Rosie takes this story to depths that people in this profession love. This book holds such a ""Big Surprise"" for readers. The best thing about Rosie's writing is that she writes just like she speaks, which makes her writing even more interesting. I don't think Rosie researched the Psychiatric Disorder, Multiple Personality Disorder, when she wrote this book, and it didn't matter. She wrote from the heart and learned her way through this very difficult illness with her e-mail friend. As always, her compassion just shines throughout the book. No wonder we all love her so much. I think she would make a wonderful Psychologist, as her next profession. She certainly has that drive and potentional in making one. I highly recommend this book. It was nothing like I thought it was going to be like at all. Keep writing, Rosie. You are great at it also, among your many other talents."
5,"Rosie-Ro-Roseann-The Real Person, not the celebrity.","There are a few 1-2 star reviews for this book saying that you don't get to know Rosie. Let me tell you, you get to know Rosie. She was obsessed with helping this woman with MPD and it consumed her life for almost a year. She also flashes back to her childhood-what she can remember. But if you are looking for a book to see what her favorite foods/movies are you aren't going to get it here. This book is much deeper than that (I suggest you find a fan-based website.) At the end of the book I wanted just hug her-what a great afternoon read."
2,"You won't ""find her"" here","This book was very disappointing. I really expected to ""find"" Rosie in here somewhere. There are little glimpses here & there; she is brutally honest about recognizing she's got some problems (obsessiveness being one of them). The book is a ""quick read."" I hope some day Rosie writes her autobiography and tells about life at the two colleges she attended, what is was like coming up through the comedy club scene, her relationship with her family, etc."
5,"Powerful, touching, surprising","As a fan of Rosie O'Donnell I ordered this book as soon as it was announced as a pre-purchase, completely unaware of what it would contain. I received it yesterday and finished reading it this morning. This book reads very quickly. I was completely caught up in this incredible story and unable to put it down. The book was a complete surprise, the story was touching, powerful and not at all what I expected. The most pleasant surprise of this book was Rosie's writing style. I found her words to be honest, direct, raw and engrossingly warm to read. This book broke my heart but then left me with an enriched understanding of the human spirit and humanity. As a fan of Ms. O'Donnell, I now completely understand why she is leaving her show. I will miss her, but I only hope that this book is the beginning of more books to come from a naturally gifted, touching author. I will recommend this book to everyone I know, it will be my favorite gift to give this year."
1,What was that?,"I bought this book at the dollar store and I think it was overpriced. I can't believe anyone published this book. It is like reading someone's story of a dream they had. It is confusing and it is just a dream so, who cares. Why would you want to read about it? I like Rosie, but I think you are missing nothing if you skip this book. I thought it would be a kind of bio, but it wasn't that at all. It was strange, and not even in an interesting way."
5,wow!!,"I bought this book at 8:00 in the evening, and finished it that night. I could not put it down, and I don't remember the last time a book did that to me. What kept me glued? The raw-honest look into a celebrity's life and the reminder that fame and fortune, as much as we all dream about them, don't solve a thing. But more importantly, the story of how one woman's unselfishness,courage, and determination to help a complete stranger ultimately gave her a gift beyond her wildest dreams...a gift that all the money in the world could have never,ever given her. Rosie O'Donnell writes with such complete honesty while allowing the world to share in such obviously intimate experiences of her life. It is an amazing story."
2,I thought this was an autobiography????,"Sorry to say, but I didn't like this book. Very boring read. I love Rosie and wanted to know more about her life and what made her who she is today. This book rarely dishes on that. It is mostly about a girl that she is obsessed with talking to and helping. I didn't give a hoot about some strange girl and their phone conversations. Wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Was actually embarrassed that I bought it after I read it. Rosie...please do a real autobiography!"
5,Excellent Writing!,"Rosie has done an excellent job with writing this book. The story is quite captivating. Her ability to weave her childhood memories into what she learned about herself from a seeming stranger is fascinating. No, it is not a tell-all book. Yes, you might be amazed at her impulsiveness, but even she admits she's not proud of all her reactions. It is one person's story about her struggle with the trauma in her life. If that is interesting to you, pick up this book!"
1,Dull/rushed delivery on audiobook,"The book may be decent, but Rosie's narration on the audiobook is horrible. She rushes sentences together and sounds bored and as if she just rolled out of bed. Sentences which should have a powerful dramatic impact (e.g. rosie's mom dieing) just come off plain and dull. Its as if rosie just didn't care anymore. Shame."
2,A troubled star and a disappointing read,"O'Donnell deserves respect for honesty and her well publicized charity, but this thin book is very disappointing. While she readily admits she ""needs help"", it becomes all too apparent that the gifted comedianne hasn't moved past her mother's unfortunate death and her father's emotional paralysis. As a result, she comes off as juvenile, stupid, and boring. Her long e-mail excerpts are also tedious and uninspired. Read it overnight if you must, but its not worth your time. Hopefully she's found TRUE counseling now that she's retired."
5,COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!!,"Wow. This book is nothing like what I expected. It is so much more. If you liked ""A BEAUTIFUL MIND"" for it's compelling, moving, interesting, sad, scary, funny, eye opening story, you'll like this, too.The book is about how Rosie's relationship with a 14 year old pregnant, unwed Mother changed her life forever, in ways she never could've imagined.You reach a point in the book (at least I did) when you jaw will hit the ground. You never see it coming and when you're in it, there's no turning back. You HAVE to see how it all ends.It's written well, it's a quick (but deep) read and it will leave you thinking about it long after you've finished reading."
3,"Interesting, but not compelling","I read this book straight through last night. Rosie shares a lot about her childhood and about raising her own kids, and I found all of that very interesting. But the book revolves around her obsession with Stacie and Stacie's family, and about how gullible Rosie is when she thinks she can ""save"" someone. If it were me, I would be too embarrassed to tell anyone about how I was duped, much less write a book about it.If you are already a Rosie fan, you'll enjoy some, if not all, of this book. Otherwise, move on."
2,I give it two for being a compelling read...,"but Rosie O'Donnel is a nutjob. She has serious issues. The fact that she flew this clinically insane woman out to NYC for a meet n' greet says loads about her own insanity. I had the heebie jeebies after reading this book. Rosie - you need therapy. And if you're already in therapy, you need to fire your shrink and get a better one."
3,Just Read It...,"I don't usually read auto-biographies, but I found ""Find Me"" interesting and an easy read. It wasn't a book I decided to keep on my shelf, but I did enjoy reading it all the same."
5,Riveting read,"You find yourself totalling intrigued why Rosie O'Donnell could become so attached to a stranger and what they had in common. A tottally different Rosie is exposed. I always felt she was ""hurting"" emotionally, I never realized how deeply. You feel like you are on an emotional roller coaster."
2,Not the Rosie I expected at all...,"Though the book was written with a style that only Rosie O'Donnel could, this book left me with an incredible empty feeling. I finished the book wondering what Rosie was trying to accomplish by even writing this book. I can totally relate to the drama life can bring such as losing a parent, but one must deal and go on. Rosie never showed me in her book that she did go on. She never keyed in on her strong bond between her and her children or her and Kelli. Though I don't want to know all about Rosie, I thought her book did nothing more than expose all of her weakeness. The book led you on a bizarre journey, one that left you totally and completely disappointed. I hated the book and where it eventually ended up. Rosie just opened the door for all the unstable people in America to call her at home. I guess this just wasn't what I was expecting from Rosie and was sadly disappointed!"
5,Find Rosie's book,"I just finished Rosie O'Donnell's biography and I have to admit it was an interesting journey. This is not the typical biography---starting with ""I was born in such and such town"" and so on. Instead Rosie gives us a glimpse of the kind of person she is through a story that is weaved into references of her mother's death and its powerful affect on her. The tragic rape and pregnancy of a 14 yr old that she encounters on the internet and becomes ""obsessed"" with helping is the story that unfolds and contains a lot of twists and turns. Rosie reveals a good deal of herself, flaws and all, through this little biography that leaves you wishing she would talk more. In trying to help this ""victim"" she realizes that she too needs help and guidance from friends and family. Rosie is an interesting person that I hate to see leave the world of television. Hopefully, we can look forward to more books from this talented lady."
4,bizarre,"As I listened to this book on tape recently, I just kept thinking, 'how depressing', 'how negative', 'how cynically she looks at the world'. Yet, I couldn't stop listening, surely there must be something uplifting, somewhere in her life. Rosie has clearly had many personal tragedies in her life, that she has yet to overcome. Maybe one day she will turn her obsession to help on herself, and truly help those closest to her."
2,A bit disappointing,"Rosie O'Donnell has chosen a fairly unique approach in writing this autobiography. Instead of giving a chronological account of her life, as most biographers would, she uses an internet relationship as the framework from which the rest of the story unfolds. Through this relationship we see how Rosie thinks and feels, the types of things she does, some of her dreams, we learn a bit about her children and also some of the things that have happened in her life. However, I found the path that her internet relationship took to be predictable, and the details of her ""inner world"" were too few to compensate for the lack of concrete facts and events that make up her life.I give her credit for writing this book entirely on her own, as so many celebrities use writers to help put their stories together. But had she taken a more conventional approach her story may have been a bit longer and more substantive."
3,Wasn't sure of the point...,"This was interesting book, but I have to agree with one of the reviewers ahead of me that I wasn't sure of the purpose of the book. I don't know exactly what I was expecting to read, but it wasn't what I found. Good none the less, but definetly a somewhat odd book. It showed Rosie in a very niave sort of light, and I'm not sure how to take it...Read this book, it's good...not great, but worth the time."
3,"You go, girl!","O'Donnell is an ordinary person who has had a tremendous run of good fortune. If you found her talk show entertaining, you will probably enjoy this not-very-revealing, formulaic autobiography. (It's a very fast read, because you never feel the need to pause and reflect; there's nothing that merits close attention.) If you found her talk show dull, if you found her chatter shallow, nothing in this book is going to convince you that the woman has any depths. The book is a verbose reiteration of what she has already said in her recent TV interviews. You've heard of novelizations? This book is an autobiographization."
1,It stank,"I read this book in one night at the public library. I feel almost sorry for Rosie O'Donnell. She is a very sick, codependent woman. She has absolutely no boundaries and that's very unhealthy. I feel very sorry for her children to grow up in a house with a woman who doesn't want to learn to take care of herself. Sad."
5,Not what you might think,"Many of my friends think Rosie is a fake-that she is some Hollywood star who doesn't care for her kids and makes all sorts of money so she shouldn't be shopping at the discount racks at Target. I see Rosie as someone just like me, who also stars in a fantastic talk show, that has done very well, so she makes a lot of money. Rosie just goes to show that no matter how much money you have, you still have struggles in your life.This book shocked me and for that reason you should buy it. It's not about Rosie being gay, a millionare or any of the other stuff that you might think. It's about a 40 year old woman (Rosie) who gave her self to another woman she felt connected to for lots of different reasons."
5,Couldn't put it down,"Rosie is quite unique, the story is quite interesting, and shows stardom from a whole different perspective, Rosie is a master at this. I recommend it."
2,Embarrassing,"As others have said, for the die-hard Rosie fan who wants to know everything about her,Find Meis part of everything. Self-realization notwithstanding, the main story in this book is embarrassing. Fine that Rosie calls herself obsessed and crazy, but she didn't get over it by the time the book ended. Isn't that the point of acknowledging ones wallowing? -- getting out of it and taking a shower?"
3,Not my all time favorite book,"I loved watching Rosie O'Donnell and have quite a bit of respect for her. I bought this book hoping for some insight into her amazing life, but this book was very hard to get through. It seemed more about compulsive behavior than the story of her helping a young lady. I tried hard to like this book, but lost my interest somewhere in the middle."
5,Suprisingly Great Book,"Don't get me wrong, I love Rosie. I get her magazine, I sometimes watch her show. I requested this book from the library and it took a little while before I got it. When I did get it, I was not in the mood to read ""Rosie O was born on..."" blahblahblah. So I left the book on my dining room table for 3 days. Then I picked it up while the kids were sleeping, and I NEVER PUT IT DOWN until I was done. Not only was this not your typical autobiography, it kept me on the edge of my seat wondering about ""Stacie"". I learned a lot about Rosie but not too much that she came across annoying. It proves that money does not always buy happiness (or sanity)! Great read. I recommend it to everyone!"
3,Good but...,"It a eassy and interesting book to read. Rosie is a good story teller, she make you care about the person in the book, make you want to know more about them. She relate funny and sad memories. It start good but become very confusing and very hard to believe but has life is strange sometime truth is more strange then movie and this time this story is very strange. The book left me wondering why to some questions I have. How come Melissa said she was pregnant, how could she make it beleive to Rosie. It's pretty hard to believe that Rosie had fall for all this, that story is very strange but surely can be true."
2,"Compelling, but almost disturbing.","I thought this book was a page turner, but it left me feeling a little sad for Rosie. Not sad for where she has been, but sad when I think about where she is going. I hope she finds happiness and peace in her life. This book shows a side of Rosie that no one who watches her show would ever expect. She is a survivor of a childhood that was at times very difficult. She has risen, literally out of the ashes, but remains very tormented and unhappy about certain aspects of her life. She is very honest about her self described shortcomings and the book is very well written."
2,Very little substance,"The book is thin and the print large.I'm afraid I found Rosie's childhood memories utterly boring. The only thing that keeps you in this book is wanting to know what's the deal with the teenager mother. You find out. You dully think: ""Oh, OK."" Then it's the end, which is flat and disapointing.Can't say I would recommend the read."
1,Trees died for this book,"Nothing personal against Rosie O'Donnell, but this is one of the worst books I've ever read! At least the money from the sales went to charity. That's a plus!"
2,A Pathetic Rosie,"In reading this book I felt a deep sense of sadness for Rosie. I too lost my mother at a young age, not as young as Rosie, and I believe you never really get over the lost of a parent, perhaps especially a mother, but Rosie seems not to be able move past her mom's death. I found it very hard to believe that she would continue her relationship with Melissa/Stacie/Kate after realizing the truth. The book seemed to go no where. I'm not sure what was the point of writing it to begin with. It left me feeling empty and thinking to myself, Rosie has some major issues. If she is not the TV host, is she the author of this book? And the author of this book scared me a little. It was a quick read, because I kept thinking at some point things will begin happening. Nothing every developed. At least the proceeds from the book are going toward a charity, otherwise, I would have felt like I just wasted [$]..."
1,For hardcore Rosie fans only,"This book was awful. It took only an hour or so to read. It seems like it also may have taken an hour or so to write. There is no substance to this ""book"" at all. Rosie, bless her heart, is a great person, but there's not much to this. She befriends an underaged pregnant woman, finds out the real deal, and helps her. It was life-changing. She cannot get over her mother's death. That's about it. There is nothing else here. She seems scarily odd, also, almost insane. If you love Rosie and want to learn about her, go for it. For the casual fan on down, it is a complete waste of time and money. I have read pamplets at the doctor's office that have more substance."
5,Great read.,"I am a big fan of Rosie O'donnel and I couldn't wait to read this book. I thought that it was going to be more about Rosie's personal life, but it was mostly about Stacie, the girl she was trying to help. Rosie did share parts of her life with us. She told us enough to let us into her thoughts and emotions but not so much that she was rambling about her life. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and I recommend it to anyone. Even if you aren't a huge Rosie fan, the twisted, true-life story is interesting and surprising. Great Read!"
1,She's a Rambling Woman...,"Boy, was I disappointed in this book. This slim volume contains a bunch of ramblings, vaguely centered on Rosie's relationship (if you can call it that) with a woman with multiple personality disorder. She talks about losing her mom, having OCD (maybe) and dealing with the problems of the MPD woman. I couldn't find the thread of the narrative, and felt like the story was very disjointed. Little aphorisms are sprinkled throughout, breaking up the story even more. My thought on finishing the book was ""OK, so what?"". Why was this story worth telling? Because she's Rosie, I guess."
3,"Best Ever Artwork, but Totally Flawed Mastering","This new 2011 CD release of the Beach Boys 1964 Christmas album, with the original 12 tracks and no bonus tracks, features a true representation of the original front and back covers of the original LP for the first time in CD format, plus 2 additional Christmas photos of the group that have been used on other reissues.However, the music on the CD is all wrong, literally. The first 5 tracks are in mono, and the final 7 in stereo, a jumbled configuration that never existed on vinyl. And to make matters worse, ""Little Saint Nick"" is the 45 single version with all the added percussion instead of the album version.So, I recommend this for fans to get the nice artwork, but you'll have to burn your own disc to go with it using the complete album in stereo as originally issued (which was all included on the CD ""Beach Boys Ultimate Christmas"" back in 1998."
1,Not so good,The CD itself had a bad track (number 3). Therefore I returned it and was refunded the price. It was handled but disappointing.
4,"takes 1 min to make 4) 3"" mini pizzelles that taste great","The other reviews are correct, but no one warns you that these are not the normal 5"" pizzelles as Amazon implies with it's ""doubles as ice cream cones"" bullet. These are 3"" circles that are really too small for anything except tiny snacks. Curled into bowls they hold a bit over an ounce (30cc) so whatever dessert you make it'll be tiny. On the other hand they taste great and if you put a very small scoop of ice cream, 2 or three red raspberries (3 black raspberries wouldn't fit) and a bit of your favorite sauce, you've got a great thing. It would take at least 3-4 to satisfy the average guy, though. Unless there's some reason you want tiny, I'd go with the 5"" pizzelles."
5,I love my new Pizzelle baker!,"I got mine (quickly even with free shipping) and made almond pizzelles the very next weekend. They were a huge hit. I make about 20 christmas gift baskets every year and fill them with jams, quick breads, and homemade cookies. This year everyone will be getting a bag of pizzelles too. I love the fact that they are 3 inches instead of 5. You can make 4 at a time and they are less likely to break. I just purchased a second Quattro Pizzelle Baker to give as a gift."
4,fattening fantasies,I first saw this machine on the Martha Stewart show and have been dying to try it ever since. It makes several at a time and so it saves time and has a finish that makes clean up a breeze. I can't wait to get started.
1,It would have been great,"It would have been great if Amazon actually ever sent it. They tell you it will ship for free, they dont tell you that the estimated ship date would be 55 days!"
2,Disappointing!,"No thermostatic control. Does not heat uniformly. Pizzelles are dark in some places, light in others. Is most definitely NOT non-stick...count on the first two batches becoming firmly affixed in every tiny groove, even when oiled well. Have a firm toothbrush handy and lots of patience."
3,Pizzelle maker,The non-stick surface is not as good as the old fashioned metal grids. Makes a thicker cookie.
3,It's okay.,"I am happy for the author for his successes, but... he knew people that could help him get his foot in the door. He really has no knowledge of how to help you get YOUR foot in the door, other than general comments on what he would do if he had not known anyone. I am slightly unhappy with the book because the reason I bought it was to get my ideas developed into tangible products. This book will tell you valuable info on what the terms are and helpful info on making a decision about how to proceed, but not enough info about getting to the decision makers of a company. You will be more knowlegable if you buy this book, but you still have a ton of research ahead of you, as the author doesn't help you by providing names and address of key personnel that can help you get your idea or invention shown. Some of you may still feel like ""idiots"" when you're done reading this book. (?)"
1,This book is awful,"I bought this book thinking it would clearly help the process of getting an invention to market. Boy was I wrong. This book is confusing and the ideas seem randomly scattered throughout its many pages. I recommend instead ""How to Licnese Your Million Dollar Idea"" by Harvey Reese and ""The Moms Inventors Handbook"" by Tamara Monosoff. These two books are thinner and more straight forward."
3,Picture friendly but informative,"The book has a lightweight appearance but there is good advice on negociating contracts based on years of selling inventions and what to look out for - this is where I think the book really wins. It explains contracts and how to get the best one. Later in the book, there is more rudimentary descriptions of the different types of design types and loads of links to both government agencies and independent advice bureaus. It also explains the history of Patents which I found informative and dots humorous and common-garden inventions used today. For such a legalistic thing to attempt to do, I think the book did a good job of making it reasonably clear."
4,Better than Edison Himself!,"What can I say? This guy is the guy behind Furby. My kids no longer even play with that revised Cabbage Patch upgrade!But, if he can make a fortune, why can't I?Okay, I'm not gonna tell you what my ideas are, but I will say I also used Michael levine's Guerila PR: Wired. Why am I telling you this?Simple! I lost a bet with my ex-wife. I thought about getting my lawyer's advice, but he had to ""suddenly leave town.""Anyway, I think Levy has some good ideas, so I really suggest using it. You might want an apartment near the u.S. Patent Office, though. And near your banker."
5,If I could have only one book besides my Bible ...,"If I were stranded on a desert island and could only have the Bible and one other book, this might well be that other. (Sure, it's a three-part set, but it's my little contest so I set the rules.) The Drs. Morris look at scripture, science and society in terms of biblical creation - and perhaps most important, demonstrate beyond the shadow of any doubt that real science supports the Genesis account of our universe's origins."
2,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed with that CD his other CD Lucky Man was so much better, I think they did to much talking in between songs and did not care for the other person singing on the CD he actually took away from Henry the only part I liked was when Henry himself did the singing, so from now on I will not buy a CD with someone other than Henry Gray singing."
1,Asenath - NOT!,"As an Israeli and a ""name freak"", I found the authors' editorializing approach nearly offensive. Who are they to decree whether a name is a ""girls' name"" or a ""boys' name"", or ""in"" or ""uncool""? These ""facts"" change about yearly.In addition, their knowledge of Hebrew is spotty at best, which can be dangerous. For instance, they tell you that Asenath is a Biblical name, but do they tell readers that in Hebrew it's pronounced ""oh-SNOT""? I found other similar but no less annoying misinformation as well. I recommend going Beyond Rosenkrantz and Satran...to other sources."
4,"Cute, Clever and Creative","I found the unique listing and advice very helpful. When trying to find names it is easy to find a list wth the meanings, what is difficult is to find creative ways to use that ""First Letter"" or to find a middle name to work well with the other name. At least There were advisories to those thousands who named their daughters after comets and chees . (Haley Brie!)"
5,THIS BOOK IS VERY CONTROVERSIAL,"Some people might find this book unpleasant and controversial, but I found it intriguing. It deals with a subject that isn't your regular run of the mill topic. If your looking for a story of love, little puppies, and a world that is make believe, don't read this book. However, if you are looking for a book that is hard hitting, dealing with real life and a subject we all like to hide from. Please read The Circle of Death. I know author Robert Rohloff will take a lot of slack for writing this book from people with closed minds. However, that's what makes this crazy old world so interesting, we all have the freedom of speech, and have the lack of restrictions to enjoy other peoples freedom of speech."
5,I DARE YOU TO READ THIS BOOK!,THE CIRCLE OF DEATH HAD MY SKIN CRAWLING. JUST WHEN YOU THINK THAT YOU HAVE FIGURED OUT WHAT THE GAME IS AUTHOR ROHLOFF TAKES YOU DOWN A BACK ALLEY AND HITS YOU OVER THE HEAD WITH A SURPRISE THAT WILL HAVE YOUR EYES WIDE AND YOUR HEART POUNDING. THIS BOOK IS A SPINE-TINGLING NOVEL OF TERROR AND SUSPENSE THAT WILL HOLD YOU CAPTIVATED!
4,"THIS BOOK KEEPS YOU WANTING MORE, AND MORE, AND MORE!","The Circle of Death is a book that will have you up late, paging through the pages to find out what happens next. This enthralling masterpiece by Rohloff might be his first book, but he already writes like he is a seasoned pro. This is a spine-chilling story that will grip you in its merciless spell of suspense, and hold you there into the late night until you come to an end, exhausted, chilled, and scared to close your eyes.Rohloff's characters are believable, real people like you and I. The game will have your heart pounding, and your eyes open wide throughout every gripping moment. This book is guaranteed to take your breath away."
5,Who Owns the Wind?,"Mikela and Philip Tarlow invite the reader to deliberate this question by sharing their wisdom and knowledge about the Aboriginal belief in the connectivity of relationships. As a reader, an observer of the story, you will travel through time both past and future, chapter by chapter, experiencing the opportunity to dream about the possibilities of a new business design where ownership ideas are replaced with a regard for creativity and innovation. You are brought to an intersection in time where ideas create a place of order and rules are forever rewritten. You will not be able to resist being part of an evolution of both spirit and thought."
3,Class textbook,It's a textbook for our class. It's worth reading to know US urban history. But Kotkin sometimes write arbitrarily and his not the guy urban planners would love.
3,Doesn't know what it wants to be.,"A more appropriate title for this book would be The City Through History, A Brief Synopsis. I would also downplay the central thesis to more of a whimsy on the authors part as it is never sufficiently developed and carried through to the end. I also did not find the thesis to be very descriptive of the city I live currently in or see living in in the next 50 years. Why would an author even try to present a 'Global History' of cities in 170 pages and then on top of that try to bolt on some grand scheme for how cities develop and operate?What the book does offer is a very fast and readable sprint through 8-10 thousand years of urban history from Jericho to Los Angeles, mostly deferring details and finer arguments to other authors. If one takes the book as a brief introduction on the subject then it is capable of that especially given the many references and suggested reading chapter and these ultimately are the most valuable part of the book."
2,Dysfunctional family from the 60's,"Wouldn't want to hang out with these people and the prospect of watching the entire movie was unappealing. I turned it off after about 15 minutes because it seemed too pointless.If I'd known of this family back in the sixties, I would have avoided them."
2,Depressing,"This movie is a total downer. I am not sure how anyone found anything ""hilarious"" about it. I appreciate a good drama but this is not one. A peek inside the life of a of a disturbingly dysfunctional family destroyed by alcohol and a tragic event. It lacked depth and even a believable premise. Not worth it in my opinion."
2,New Age Healing Handbook,"Rather a disappointment as none of the ads for this book hinted at the strong new age slant of the healing techniques. For each health topic the remedies cover areas like Acupressure, Aromatherapy, Ayurveda, Flower Remedy/Essence Therapy, Food Therapy, Homeopathy, Hyrotherapy, Imagery, Juice Therapy, Massage, Reflexology, Relaxation & Meditation, Vitamin & Mineral Therapy and Yoga. Most of these would seem to appeal to the esoteric new age mindset. In my opinion, about 30 percent of the 700+ page book are based upon useful scientific data. Overall, it was disappointing. I am glad I bought the paperback version and not the $20+ hardback copy."
3,Help for my daughter.,"This was recommended by someone in a caregiver support group. I bought this for my oldest daughter who has had to grow up with two disabled siblings. She's 20 now and I wish I'd read it 10+ years ago. Both my husband and I read it and thought it was pretty good and helpful to understand how growing up ""The Other One"" makes you different. Of course, we were aware to some degree, but it always helps reading about others' experiences. Will be giving it to my daughter next week and I hope knowing that she's not alone in how she's felt will help her."
5,"Easy, easy, easy!","I researched and debated for a couple of months before I bought this product. I am not disappointed. Knowing what a mess a mediocre pizzelle iron can make of the cookies, I was after a product that was truly non-stick. This iron makes the process effortless: it couldn't be any more non-stick, and clean-up is almost non-existent using a paper towel to wipe any crumbs away. We will be enjoying this iron for years to come."
2,communication,"I ordered this pizzelle baker on Nov. 11, 2007 to be sent as a GIFT to an individual in another state. It was sent from ""Hug the Cook"" - after some delay - with the PURCHASE PRICE included with the shipment. Was there something I overlooked and this gift with purchase- price -included mistake could have been avoided? I didn't want it gift-wrapped; but just sent as a gift. I really feel badly about this and am reconsidering ordering from Amazon ever again."
2,Not what I expected,Was expecting a super bright flashlight that I would rely on in emergencies. What I got was mediocre at best. I bought a $2 L. E. D. light that's 4x as bright. Don't waste your money with this one. Pay for the Maglight or Streamline
5,Excelente libro,"El universo de esta serie, un resumen de capítulos y análisis de producción de esta serie que duro 7 temporadas. Los Borg fueron redescubiertos en esta espectacular serie donda la Capitana es una mujer. Janeway y Siete de Nueve alumbran las estrellas."
1,Disappointing,"Unlike the previous Star Trek 'bible' (STAR TREK DEEP SPACE NINE COMPANION) this book offers very little beyond episode synopses. There's very little behind the scenes, concept or production information.After the obligatory episode synopses, there are brief paragraphs with inane headings such as SENSOR READINGS, DAMAGE REPORT and PERSONAL LOGS that contain little more than that episode's techno-babble and trivial facts like ""Sensors detect a class-M planet at a heading of 178-Mark-4"" and ""Torres likes extra paprika on her potato salad.""My reason for reading these Star Trek Companion books is to learn something new about the shows I love so much.This book fails to deliver.If you have seen the show, you have no reason to purchase this book."
3,Only for hard core fans,"I'm a hardcore voyager fan, and waited in anticipation for this book to arrive. However, it did fall short of my expectations. As there are so many similar reviews already, I will keep this short and to the point.Basically, it is just a detailed episode guide. There are a lot of picutres, but all are in Black and White, no colour shots are included.Overall, I would say save your money, and go to www.startrek.com for episode descriptions."
1,Not as good as other companions,If you are buying this book to read the interesting behind the scenes notes. DON'T BOTHER! Unlike the Next Generation and Deep Space Nine Companions this book offer very little in the way of commentary. It has many statistics that the author kept track of like who died duringthe episode and facts learned about the characters but other than that all of the information can be found on many of the fan sites and episode guides. My advice save your money and wait for the DVDs next year.
1,Big disappointment,"After reading the Deep Space Nine Companion, which was full of interesting production notes, I eagerly anticipated the Voyager Companion.But this book is nothing but episode synopis after episode synopsis. Assuming it would contain copious production notes as the DS9 book did, I requested it for a birthday present without looking it over. If I had looked it over, I would have asked for something else.I'll read between the lines and surmise that Rick Berman and company opted to omit the production notes because there was a surfeit of controversy and discontent behind the scenes.I'd amire them a lot more if they weren't afraid to air their dirty laundry."
5,A much recommended Companion the Star Trek Series,"Trekkers and trekkies will will enjoy the archival quality of this book. New Star Trek fans will find it doubly useful to explain what happened in each episode to people who may not have watched every Star Trek Series episode so many multiple times that they can intuitively grasp every nuance.For me, I use it to select which episode I'm going to watch tonight. It refreshes my memory relative to connecting the title with the episode content. Plus, there's enough interesting content to really bring people into the Start Trek Universe. This Companion is much recommended."
1,disappointing,"Having recently purchased the superlative DS9 Companion, I had high expectations for this book. I was sorely disappointed.There is an almost total lack of behind-scenes stories or critical analysis. Those are two main reasons to even write a companion book in the first place, so it was a noticeable problem.The plot summaries are bland, uninformative, and dull. Many contain factual errors.The writing is extremely labored. It is riddled with grammatical problems, run-on sentences, and incorrect punctuation. The author does not seem to understand how to correctly use the word ""however"" in a sentence. I'm not normally a grammar nazi, but the writing in this book is so poor that it's often difficult to discern what the author is even saying.Buy it if you want, but keep expectations low. This book is not of the same caliber as the DS9 Companion."
3,Ruditis gets another bone thrown his way,"It seems that when a genre franchise is nearing its demise, it invariably calls in Paul Ruditis to start cranking out its official companion book. Buffy, Alias, and Star Trek have all put him in charge of what turns out to be the final edition of their shows' guidebooks. He uses the same format in each, gives little or absolutely no behind-the-scenes info, and assembles cutely-named factoid checklists for each episode. I cannot know how much effort he puts into them, but they are typically very disappointing (do any of them have more than three stars on Amazon?) and seem merely like quick moneymaking ploys by Fox, Touchstone, and Paramount, respectively.In fairness, virtually all the behind-the-scenes 'Voyager' info you could wish for (more, actually) was in Stephen Poe's ""A Vision of the Future: ST:VOY"" but still... Even though 'Voyager' was often maligned, it deserved much better than this."
3,Only for diehard fans,"There's not much here that you won't find elsewhere on the net, but it's good if you're a diehard Voyager. There's a little insight into the background of the show, info on the aliens, and ships throughout the series, and my favorite, some great pictures. Plus an episode guide. If you're looking for a massive behind the scenes bible, this probably isn't it. It's much more broad, and like I said, only for the diehards."
4,A Companion for true VOYAGER FANS!!,I am a major Voyager fan and I have been waiting for this book for almost a year now. The reason being Voyager was a little different from other Star Trek series. It had interesting and charming characters and wonderful stories.This companion itself may not be as impressive as the DS9 companion with all the interviews with cast and crew but it does have interesting facts from each episode that I found just amazing. I also loved the many of the big pictures of each episode and I learned more about the Voyager crew I didn't know before. It's a must for Voyager fans out there!!!! If your not a big Voyager fan you may still find a fun read.
2,Uninspiring,"If you were expecting this to be similar to the quality and content of the DS9 companion then you'll be greatly disappointed.Each episode is listed followed by 1 or 2 pages of what I call ""stating the obvious."" There is no analysis, no background information no discussion as to what worked and what didn't.I love Voyager dearly and really wanted to like this book. Do yourselves a favor and do not buy it. It gives you absolutely no insight into each episode at all."
1,A Terrible Disappointment,"Quick review: If you ever purchased the ST:TNG Companion by Larry Nemecek, you'll be disappointed by the Voyager Companion. It's simply an episode guide and you can get that for free on the internet.Maybe if Voyager fans are lucky, Mr. Nemecek will decide to create a companion for Voyager."
3,Not bad Companion,Like many I was slightly disappointed about how the companion did have a lack of production/behind the scene information unlike TNG and DS9 companion which included that type of information. The Voyager Companion does have if positive side it does contain a good amount of information about the shows and aliens that made appears. I would recommand it for die-hard fans of Voyager.
3,"Not so much a companion, as an episode guide.","To a lot of Trek fans, the franchise came back strong with The Next Generation and peaked with Deep Space Nine. Voyager was the weakest of the three. The same could be said for the show companions. The companion for The Next Generation was pretty good. Better summaries of the episodes and behind the scenes info than the companion for the original series. But the companion for Deep Space Nine raised the bar. Packed full of info on the making of the episodes as well as detailed show summaries, this book set the standard. The companion for Voyager pales in comparison. It works pretty good as an episode guide. But there is not nearly enough behind the scenes information to truly make this a companion. The use of ""Damage Reports"" and ""Ships Logs"" to bring up bits of trivia isn't worth the space it takes up. Voyager was an enjoyable show, and this companion is nice to have. I just wish they put more effort into it."
4,Norma Burrowes!,"Norma Burrowes - beautiful voice. She has an excellent light sound for this type of music. The other singers are good but she's the best on here, I think. I just wish there where some sound clips so the public could hear how beautiful this CD is! In other news I wish Norma Burrowes would cut another disc!"
4,Exquisite,Color is a design element that is more of an art but uses some level of science. John Pile's book is a clear and concise guide to designing with color. The photos are rich and offer delightful examples of rooms in which color creates an atmosphere of perfect harmony.
3,Photography disappointing,"The author obviously went to great deal of effort to create/find photos of examples for his color theories. However, in the format of this large book they appear mostly blurry and grainy. Very distracting and amateur-looking book."
5,color in interior design,"As a lay person just interested in learning more about the use of color in interior design, this was an excellent book. While the first several chapters were very ""text bookish"", the remainder was very layman friendly. I feel more confident in undertaking color projects in my home and in conversing about the use of color with friends, who are now asking my opinions. The chapters that helped me the most were on the color wheel and color relationships. I enjoyed it and will now pursue my interest in color and design."
5,excellent book,Well written and informative. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about color.
5,Good product,"First tent I have owned since school days a lifetime ago. Very simple assembly and functional. I am 6ft and sharing with anotht person would be a bit ""too cosy"". However, I dont plan on having company and appreciate the extra room so 5x* from me."
3,Average,"I give this tent an average rating. I've only used it once though, and not in the rain so I don't know how dry it stays. I got the eureka footprint too and it seems too slick, like the floor slides around on it. I like the size and color. The bag it comes in is already ripping at the seams."
4,Wide Ranging Essay on all Things Gothic,"Mark Edmundson has created a book (really a series of intertangled essays) on angels, sadomasochism and the culture of gothic (as goes its sub-title). Nightmare on Main Street is a fascinating look at a dark, disturbing, interesting subject. The joy in this book, and sometimes its frustration, is the wide range from two centuries old gothic novels to Forrest Gump, Oprah and Iron John/Women Who Run With Wolves. The connections are not always clear but the writing will carry the reader along this weird academic roller coaster ride as they nod along in agreement (for me particulary the Forrest Gump section) or they shake their head in exasperation or frustration. Either way it will get the reader thinking of everything around them in terms of gothic or angel (and these words are very loosely defined in order to create a net big enough to catch all of Edmundson's concepts). This book was an intelligent read."
3,"Conflate, conflate!","Thought-provoking, if you can handle the academic style--but like most academic books that wander into the field of popular culture, the references to highfalutin stuff aren't totally matched by a thorough familiarity with the ""low end"" material. Mneh. Too many sweeping claims."
1,"See the movies, don't read the book","I only made it up to p. 45 for a paper I was writing on ""Carrie."" Along with a pompous tone, I didn't find this added anything concrete to what I know about horror flicks. The author might have found the Main Street and nightmare metaphors personally powerful for some reason, but they were idiosyncratic and I didn't find them in any of my other horror movie secondary sources. Not interested in having a conversation with myself, I moved on. Also, I'm put off by the author's need to see violence, sex, and greed in almost every detail of these films. Even Carrie and other horror movies have their moments of reflection and thoughtfulness that the author was too quick to suppress."
4,dinosaur fan,i read this book and enjoyed the easy reading. lots of kid fun and a few surprises. kids from mars are hidden by a man in a time machine. enjoy a good book with plain language where you didn't have to quess at how the names are pronounced.
2,Book didn't sell me on art therapy,"The author may be a good writer, but this book did not sell me on the idea of art therapy. I read it and still wondered, what is art therapy? I agree with the first reviewer who said it is a great reference listing. But I enjoyed The Art Therapy Sourcebook more and would recommend that book if you want to know more about art therapy. It gave me a better idea of what art therapy is and how it is done."
2,"too much history, not enough substance","I was misled by the title of this book. By some stretch of the word, it could be an introduction. But it is more like a rambling exploration of the history of the field of art therapy that jumps from person to person, often with only one sentence about each person. The chapters promise information on many ideas but none is covered in any meaningful way. And I certainly did not get a positive impression of art therapy from this book. In fact, it seems like a field that does not have a clear definition or the author could not come up with one. As a clinical social worker I was hoping for some more practical and less reference-oriented. This book reads like a dictionary, so if you are looking for something like that, it is the book you want."
3,A very basic introduction to art therapy,"I bought this book for a class on the history of art therapy. Although the book does provide some interesting insights, I found Rubin's writing style frustrating. Her approach is based on her perception of what is important, rather than presenting the information in a reader-friendly format. Additionally, she does not follow the APA style, which I also found frustrating. However, she did pull together some interesting facts about the field, as well as some illuminating historical references and case studies. Rubin does believe strongly in the power of this type of treatment, and her passion is evident in her writing. Although this book may not be the best to just pick up and read, it does provide a general overview of the field that some may find useful."
2,White Border...,"There is a large white border not shown in the picture, nor given in the measurements. It is about 3 inches in width."
1,Read the original,"For a deeper and complete understanding, I would advice you to read the works of Carl Gustav Jung, the real source and origin of the many of ideas eclectically presented in this book."
1,Arbor is too short for most reasonable hole saws,I bought this arbor with the MK Morse AV92 which this claims to fit. Upon receiving the item and attempting to make a hole I noticed that this arbor's drill is far too short for the hole saw I'm using. It doesn't even drill the anchor hole before starting to drill the hole as the arbor drill is recessed into the hole saw; this make the hole saw spin all over the place as there is no anchor point for it to sit. The hole saw I couldn't really put through a test because the arbor is so short. In addition the locking mechanism looks fairly cheap and looks like it might lose the critical spring/screw that holds it all together during a typical build.
1,Not fit for the job,"Saw arbor fits AV46 but drill is to short, had to use the cheap hole saw/arbor combination coming with the UV Light to cut the hole for installation."
5,Heavy duty,"I bought this to use with the Morse 4"" hole cutter.It is well made and designed and it performed flawlessly.I've used other arbors similar to this in the past for hole saws but this one is the best."
3,live at the Apollo level 42,This is one of many bootleg audio and video sources on the market. Sound quality is good.
5,Wonderful Shabbat book for preschoolers,"This book introduces young children to Shabbat as a young spider and his mother watch a family prepare for Shabbat. The colors are bright and vivid and the text is clear and easily accessible to young children. Concepts introduced include sunrise-sunset,shabbat preparation and family togetherness. Don't miss the challah recipe on the last page."
4,A taste of Tibet,"If you have always wanted to know what travelling in Tibet is like, then this book is for you. Wendy Teasdill takes you with her as she travels from Lhasa to Mount Kailash in western Tibet. Written in an anecdotal form, it takes you on a journey of several hundred kilometers. You will be right along with her when she camps out under the stars, haggles for a ride, fords ice-cold rivers, stares at the mountain in awestruck wonder or enjoys a cup of tibetan tea in a yak-hair tent. A humourous, realistic account of travelling in Tibet, this book is a delight! You will enjoy the journey, whether is a means of re-living your own journey, as it was for me, or whether it one you intend to make or even if you choose to be an arm-chair traveller. Enjoy the trek!"
1,Too many imperfections,"My girlfriend and I ordered the same article. In each of both kit, she had about 12 pieces of flatware that had imperfections and I had about 16.We both asked Amazon to replace the kit for us and the replacement kits were as bad. Using the ""newly"" replacement kits, we were both able to come up with a good kit but still not perfect.This item is Made in Vietnam. I would think that Vietnam would be better than China -- perhaps they are better at something but they should stay away from flatware.I wouldn't buy this product again at all."
3,a little disappointed,"Shipping was very quick. It's a cute little ring. However, the ring is not as pictured. There is no antique finish to highlight details."
5,Buy it just for the research that was put into it,"After listening to the interview on NPR with Mr. Gates, I suggest he write a novel on his research of this book. It was fascinating."
3,You have to enjoy this style of writing,"This book may have great value as a historical document, however, I evaluate it from the 'fun to read' point of view. I did not find it a greatly enjoyable read. It is written in the old novel style- ""Perils of Pauline"" comes to mind. Neither did I find that I learned much about it was like to live like a slave during that time. I am now reading a historical novel in which there are a few pages describing a slave market in the USA during the Revolution; which gave me a much clearer picture than Bondwoman's Narrative did. The description of how the field hands lived left me wishing to read more about that, and in fact, I felt I did not even get a good picture of how the house servants lived. There was quite a bit of philosophizing during the entire book so the author came across as an intellectual. In this respect, her comments about the death of a fellow runaway slave towards the end of the novel were very interesting to me."
1,"It's NOT a Remastered cd! The word ""enhanced"" distorts true issue","This is a WARNING to anyone that is about to buy this specific version of Powerslave cd. It is NOT a remastered cd! This issue came from 1998. When I bought mine 3 years ago, it was advertised as ""ENHANCED"" [DIGITALLY REMASTERED]. This is a total lie and a waste of money. The CD you want was produced in 2002. I bought three other ""enhanced"" Iron Maiden cd's and I got scammed on those as well. The packaging on the 1998 and 2002 are identical. Make sure you buy the 2002. Maiden pisses me off for putting out way too many repeat cd's of the same material. They use distorted lawyer words like ""enhanced"" and make different song compilation cd's. It has gotten ridiculous. FYI ""enhanced"" means a couple of videos added... Read the cd case and it mentions you should have Windows 98!!!"
3,Not one of their best,"I don't understand the hype with this album and I am a huge Iron Maiden fan. For me it is one of the weaker albums with Dickinson. However, there are still great songs on the album that I enjoy listening to including Aces High, 2 minutes to Midnight, Powerslave and the Rime of the Ancient Mariner. Losfer Words is a pretty good tune, but not as good as their previous instrumentals. Apart from that, the other songs I find are weak. If you are a big maiden fan then I understand why you would get this album, but if not you should check out the self-titled debut or piece of mind, which are both better in my opinion."

If you are a huge Maiden fan I understand why you would buy this album, but if not I suggest checking out the self-titled debut or Piece of Mind, both which are better overall in my opinion."
2,hard to read and not an introduction,"I found I can edit my review. I originally thought I was reviewing the seller and so gave the seller a great review, but when looking back, it looked as if I was giving the book 4 stars! The book came in a timely manner and in condition described. A good price, plus it qualified for Prime Shipping. Many used books do not, so I got it in two days with free shipping! Yay! The book itself is hard to read and assumes that the reader is well versed in anthropology. This book is the required book for a class I am taking. I am into chapter 2 and have not understood one word so far. I hope things improve as time goes by, but would not recommend this book for someone looking for an introduction to symbolic anthropology."
5,Awesome CD,"I saw these guys at a show once, they are awesome, and this CD is amazing, not to mention kinda rare. It'll be a collectors item in a few years."
5,WHAT A NEAT LITTLE CRAFT SHOW BOOK! LOVE IT!,"There we were, all huddled together, out of the pouring rain, in someone's booth, in Virginia at an outdoor show, going through this little blue book, going over the shows we have been in & others we never were in. We now will do those we never heard of before! Only in this little book are some of the best little shows around & and big ones's too. Wow! Love it! We are all going to order it! Thanks Craft & Art Show Calendar and Rose Brein Finkel.When is the next one coming out???"
1,Garbage !!!,"Product was very easy to set ut and had a nice sound quality - BUTit is difficult to set the station - fading ,and it broke down after93 days of using......(warr. 90 days) Cost of repairs,shipping etcis much more than the price paid for. TedPS: Dear Amazon - in focal Rite-Aid Drugstore this unit cost $39.95 - a bit less than your price.....Desktop CD Music SystemBut we still love you and will be browsing and purchasing....... (suckers) All te best."
4,Old Testament Parallels,"This is an excellent source to keep handy. It identifies the common ancestry ofmuch of the biblical stories, and gives their derivation. Truly, there is nothing new under the sun, and originality is a word with little meaning whenancient tales are told and retold. While the plots remain the same, the characters are different. Proverbs and maxims translate quite readily across cultural lines. An ideal book for the serious student of ancient literature of the near east."
5,Great value on a sturdy mount,"My husband installed this mount himself in about an hour for our 52"" Samsung. We have a solid wood wall behind it, so no having to search for studs. It has plenty of room though for proper positioning of our size tv to accomodate variance in stud distances. The one-touch tilt is great and you lock your angle choice in so it doesn't ""droop"" out of position. (It is one-touch after taking the time to unlock the nuts on both sides.) I loved paying about $250 less than Best Buy's ""value"" mount! Take the time to read the directions, use a level, measure twice and drill once; you will not be disappointed :-)"
3,Not really a on-touch tilt,"After I put the mount on the wall, I could not found so called one-touch tilt at all - you have to use the included special long L hex driver to touch many places if you want tilt - unless you don't want to tight the mount."
5,Full marks,"The unit arrived promptly, as promised and is holding my lovely new 120 hrz/1080P 52 inch LCD screen, now at the perfect and very slightly angled position I wanted. It's a good product, with the right adjustment capabilities and most importantly--it's STRONG. Which is a peace-of-mind thing for me."
5,Does the job....,This was very easy to install. I specifically wanted this design so that I could bring power and cabling in between the supports. It comes with a variety of screws to mount almost any LCD/Plasma/LED imaginable. The Allen Wrench that comes with the unit is a little ackward to use when locking the unit in place but not a big deal.
3,the product is a good quality,"The qaulity is good, but not easy to install TV to the mount on the wall portion, and hard to access back of TV when installed. Not enough clearance."
5,Very good quality flat panel wall mount,"This wall mount was bought to handle a 50"" Samsung 50A550 plasma HDTV. This wall mount was easy to install and was very solid in it's construction. Very good price and easily handles the weight of this size plasma. Comes with all of the necessary hardware."
4,Reasonably Priced with the same quality hold,"This wall mount does the job. It was easy to install with multiply holes that you can line up with your studs. One problem we had with mounting it to the Sony Bravia 52"" is that it said the arms that attach to the TV didn't need washers, however without them the arms were not snug -- we ended up using the washers provided for other models, plus 2 of our own as the lower holes were not as snug with one washer, but needed 2. But with those, it was super snug and fit great and hung very easily and securly on the wall. We did not choose to use the tilt feature, however it was available."
3,Sturdy but you may need special screws for your TV,"The stand is sturdy and comes with quite an assormant of screws for mounting different televisions. I was using it for a Sony W3000 52"" TV. It had my TV listed in a book that said which of the sets of screws to use. I tried these and they were too long. It had another set that was the same diameter but they were too short. After reading the manual that came with my telelvision I found out that I needed an inbetween size that did not come with the mount kit. After going to 2 Home Depot's and a Lowes I was unable to find the right size bolts, so I ended up buying a set of washers, and had to use 3 of them for each of the bolts that came with mount kit so that I could tighten them with out poking a hole through the front of the TV. I was actually also surprised with Sony for not including the mounting bolts for their with tv."
3,One touch tilt???,"The TV wall mount is of good quality, but it is by no means a ""One Touch Tilt"" model. Both of the brackets have adjustments on them and consequently they must both be adjusted in order to tilt the TV up or down. Not a bad TV mount, but it is not what I ordered. Be careful when purchasing a flat-panel TV mount. Do some research and visit the manufacurers website before choosing which model you want. After you choose the model that fits your application, go back and find it on Amazon. Do not rely on the product descriptions listed on Amazon because I have found several of them to be inaccurate. I hope this info will help others make a more educated choice when they purchase their TV wall mount brackets."
2,Friendly Warning,"Be aware that many of the mounts on Amazon are incorrectly labled for TV size. The mounting bracket for this unit is only 30"" wide. The mounting holes on the back of my 47"" TV are 31"" apart! Therefore this unit will not work. The best bet if you want this brand is to go with tht ST670P. It's mounting bracket is 37"" wide. Though I doubt it will support the 73"" TV it claims it should work for TV's in the 50"" range."
4,Great Product,"Easy to install with great packaging and the nuts/bolts were individually packed. The instructions where easy to follow. Might be a little tricky to mount on 2 studs if they are 24"" on center apart. Also as usual Amazon was great. Shipped out the next day and it was on my doorstep in 2 days."
4,Economical mount,"A good mount at a good price. Directions assume technical knowledge, but not a difficult mount to install, with what is provided and some of your own tools. Shipping wasn't flawless (reason for 4 stars), didn't arrive on scheduled date. One phone call to Amazon, they tracked down the problem and had one to me in 2 days. Great Customer Service."
4,Peerless Universal Tilt Wall Mount,"We have used Peerless products for TV's many times, but this is our first experience with a flat screen mount. Our main objection was the instructions. There was a ""bolt"" holding the tilt arm from moving prior to installation and no instructions on how to remove it. We finally got it off with some prying with pliers and screw drivers. The upper part of the bracket that attached to the TV had several holes to hold the screws going into the back of the TV, but the lower section was elongated ovals that we didn't feel gave as much support so we knew the TV wouldn't ""move"" on us. We finally got it hung, but had to put the TV a couple inches higher than we had planned due to the hole location.For the future, I think it would be better to attach the brackets to the TV first - then put the wall brackets up so the TV hung at the level a person wanted.All-in-all, a good product and a very fair price."
5,"Great Mount, works on my Samsung 52","Great mount.Works with Standard 16"" apart studs and has flexibility to mount on other studs as well.Need to use the Nut Driver Bits instead of the Phillips driver while drilling into the stud.The Tilt part is little tricky, Definitely need 2 people to mount!"
5,nice sturdy mounting bracket,This was half the cost of what I could find locally. Very complete kit. Every size bolt for whatever you are mounting and labeled nicely. I mounted a 52in lcd using this kit and it worked great. Highly recommended.
5,"Solid mount, easy to install.","My wife and I mounted 52"" Samsung onto studs very easily. I like the ratcheting system."
4,poor adjustment,this wall mount is working well with a 52inch lcd tv we were able to install it in about an hour with little problem. the only downside is the long allen wrench needed to lock the tv into place could not be used because we mounted the tv over a fireplace and the mantel was in the way. We had to cut the allen wrench down to fit straight up to lock the tv in place.
1,Do the measurements on your wall first......,"I bought the ST660 based on the reviews on the site. Once I received it, I checked stud positions with my stud finder and found that they were 20"" off center, so I needed a plate that would be at least 40"" wide in order to install this properly. Instead, the wall plate is 31"" wide, which won't work at all. All of these Peerless mounts have the same instructions, and assume 16"" spacing between studs. That is not the case for some of us, and then we're left with a big box of steel that has to be sent back or put on craigslist....."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME!!,***ZERO STARS*** This game has been labeled as a sick joke played upon the victims world wide that have suffered from a brain aneurysm or lost a loved one to this tragic illness. Please show that you care by boycotting the game.
1,HORRIBLE AND DISTASTEFUL!,"This is absolutely appalling!!! I wonder what *@#&* came up with this name!! As a ruptured brain aneurysm survivor, I find nothing fun or funny about this game. Just the name alone sends my stomach churning. I can't believe a company would make light of a life threating condition such as this. Top the poor name with the write on the game itself and it's down right disgusting!! Yes, anueryms are a pain in the brain.............I spent a week in ICU. This could have killed me!!!!! Amazing that you would sell a game that the very condition the game is named from could cause the children that play it to lose a parent or other loved one!!!SHAME SHAME SHAME on the game makers.I know that there are many games and things that are sold that may offend people, but this is the ONLY disease/condition game I have ever heard of. I would rate this ZERO STARS, but that is not an option."
5,Duncan Hines 2-Piece Toaster Oven Pan with Rack,"Great quality, nice size for toaster oven. Good price, fast delivery. I bought this for my Mom because she is alone and cooks for just herself and it if perfect for one person. She is very happy with it. A good buy ! ! !"
2,not good enough,"The description states ""Sturdy carbon steel construction for strength and durability"". Well, mine didn't even last 3 years. The rust is so thick it could pass for 30 years old. As for the non-stick claim: yeh, right. Hope you have some non-stick spray!"
5,Walking with security,"The exerstrider poles are a great help to me when I do my walking. They add an extra dimension to the workout, they are supportive;very comfortable and I can use them for protection if I need to. This is the third pair I have ordered. One for my college roomate who had knee surgery but it didn't quite help. She walks with these every day and she loves them. The last pair were for a friend who had just had a double masectomy and I thought they might help her when she goes to walk. There are dogs in her neighborhood and she was afraid. They should never be used for this purpose but I think that the security gives you a peace of mind that you might not get otherwise."
2,Cheap. Flimsy. Hard to use. Hard to clean.,"If you like flimsy plastic, a filter basket that's difficult to insert and a door that won't close easily, then this is the coffee maker for you!First off, this coffee maker is made from such a soft plastic you think it would melt. After about six weeks of use mine has not melted, but the soft plastic leads to a couple of problems. First, the filter basket must be coaxed into the holder or the door won't close properly. Second, to make the door close properly, you have to pull it out of shape.Also, cleaning is difficult. The little lid on the carafe does not come off, so you can't turn it upside down to drain after you wash it, and the the hole in the top of the carafe is too small to get your hand in (and out) easily.I bought this one because I liked the way it looked. Had I seen it in person, I would not have purchased it. Maybe I'm just too picky and was used to my Mr. Coffee that lasted several years."
1,Horrendous...,"1) This is an ancient reprint. The typeface used is very poor and the reproduction is often not dark or large enough.2) Only using a Romanization makes this book almost useless when working with a native speaker. Without reinforcing Chinese characters at every opportunity, the student is wasting their time.3) No explanation of pronounciation and tone system makes the book of ZERO value when trying to learn on your own. (I suppose if you already spoke Taiwanese, the book would have some value, but... why would you buy it if you already spoke Taiwanese?)4) There is no organization of grammar.5) Worst: I have no idea if Kejia Hua (Hokkien) is that similar to Taiwanese. This book is a ""conversion"" of a Hokkien book. Had the title clearly indicated as such, I certainly would not have bought this.6) Only positive: paper is suitable bonfire or latrine use.7) Consummer fraud any way you slice it... maybe ok at a yard sale of $0.25, but no more..."
5,Excellent book!,I'm a disc jockey who's new to the game. This book seriously changed what kind of DJ I want to be and how I view today's dance music scene.It's so good that I bought two more copies for friends. Great research and great writing! Truly a fun and informative read.
3,If I hear the dj/shaman analogy one more time...,"lotsa good history, unfortunately there are too many freshman comp comments about what a good dj does w/ the crowd, and the authors could learn a thing or two about sentence structure."
5,Great Preaching and teaching,This is destine to become a classic and a must read for anyone with storm experience
5,One of the best Lifescapes CDs,This is one of the best that Lifescapes created. The music is so relaxing. The clarity of the guitars really brings out the feel that you are actually in Mexico listening to live musicians. I highly recommend this CD if you are looking to something to help you sleep or just to relax on the back porch on a warm summer day.
5,Just What I Needed,"All I needed was an inexpensive ""Thermos"" to keep my coffee hot for at least 2 or 3 hours. The Aladdin 16oz Insulate & Go definitely does the job! One day I was too busy to finish all of my coffee and it was still very warm 10 hours later. Definitely recommend this product."
4,"Great, but...","This glass-vacuum thermos works great, but it's very fragile. I bought about 3 of them but broke all within a few months. I like the glass versions because they don't give the metallic taste to drinks that the metal ones can. But they are very very fragile. I ended up buying a steel one and, although it's dented and scratched, haven't broken it yet!"
2,Watch what you wish for; then don't 'waffle.',"We looked forward to our 1st (and only) wafflemaker in our 39 year marriage.......The 1st waffle, as expected, was ""so-so,"" but the next 2 were great! That's Saturday breakfast #1. Next ""special weekend breakfast,"" I added 1/4 cup cinnamon-sugar & 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans to the 2 cup (+ other stuff) waffle mix, BUT no extra oil in mix. All 3 waffles ""split"" into top& bottom halves, regardless of baking time. But starting out this ""fun"" waffle-making session, the little ""tinny"" prongs that hold up the lid in vertical position ""sprang,"" so it could be opened ONLY full-flat....... which taught the neighbors new words, as I managed to burn 4 fingers trying to wrestle the waffle maker from falling to the floor; quality of this Villaware is underwhelming. One needs discipline in such matters! I promise to NEVER buy online again."
5,Great body brush,"I love this brush!! Last year I went to a spa in Newport, RI and during one of my treatments a boar's hair brush was used...it was pure heaven."
5,pizzelles,"I was looking for a pizzelle maker and after extensive research, this was the best option, including the price. These cookies are wonderful and the Krumkake maker works great. It heats up the way it should and the instructions are easy to follow."
4,Pretty cool device...,I really like this it makes great little 'cookies' that my family loved. It is fairly easy to use but there is a learning curve on how much batter to place on the forms. Great Item.
1,Disappointed,This is my first time to use an electric krumkake baker as I previously had the old type you use over the stove.I feel the baker doesn't bake evenly on both sides........the top of the krumkake cookie is nice but the bottom remains on the soggy side which leads me to believe the heat is uneven.Also there is no indicator light to let you know when the cookie is done. Therefore you have to really pay attention to your time. Usually it took only 55 seconds to a minute. Also hard to get two cookies commpletely round..... batter ran into each other. Perhaps my batter was too runny but have used this recipe before on the old iron without trouble.I'm at the point that perhaps the single baker would be better than the double. HOpe to find a person that could demonstrate the two cookie krumkake maker......perhaps that would help. Trying to be open-minded!
5,Great product!,"I am very happy with my purchase. Many years ago I had a similar krumkake iron which had reversible grids, which would have been nice as well. The instructions are very clear and the cookies came out perfectly.The end result is a cookie that is elegant and tasty. I used the dowel to make the rolled up version and left some flat."
5,On her way to being a legend...,"Rachel Ries has an unbelievable voice and talent to match. I cannot recommend this album enough. If you like lyrics with meaning and great music behind it you will love this album. Folky, and a bit jazzy--definitely has rhythm. I saw her play at a small gathering and she is as good in person as on this CD. One of my favorite albums. Glad to own it."
4,Say People,"This is an excellent collection of ZM&MM's best early work. I thought (from the look of the cover) that this would all be really weak because they look so young (not even any dreadlocks yet). I was pleasently surprised. This cd has a lot of the old Wailers playing instruments behind Bob's kids. I wouldn't recommend this if you don't own any other ZM&MM albums yet, but if you have a healthy dose of their later work, get this. Most of the songs were recorded only a couple of years before the definitive ""Conscious Party."" The best songs here are ""Aiding and Abetting,"" ""Say People,"" and ""Naah Leggo."" There aren't any songs that I would consider bad. I don't regularly skip any of them. Don't be fooled by the cover, this is good conscious reggae."
2,"Pinnock great, Archiv sound thin","As I have posted in my review of the 11 disc symphonies set, no's 40 and 41 seem very thin to my ear. In fact, the timpani sound like someone ""plumping a pillow"" off stage. I do not equate clear sound with well balanced sound if the proper dynamic range does not acompany it. Really wish the sound was better for these excellent performances.Follow-on Aug 11, 2005: To be fair to this single disc, I have assumed above that this version has not been remastered over that presented in the boxed set."
3,Funny & relate-able,Very funny read! Love the writer's style. Highly relate-able for women hitting the 50 mark. Will definitely purchase another book by LAURA CASTORO.........AWESOME!!
2,Picture of a different item.,"Image of item is WRONG.! Bought it because of the grey rim, the one received was all black. I'm sure it works fine, but would have bought a different one if the image actually showed the item being purchased."
2,Up To My Armpits: Adventures Of A West Texas Veterinarian,"This book started out very interesting and lighthearted. However, I am now about a third of the way thru and don't know when and if I will be able to finish it. It is about cows, cows, and more cows with an occasional story of a dog or cat. The stories all seem to be the same. I was hoping for a variety of animal stories."
2,Don't have high expectations,"This book tackles a lot of ground - perhaps too much - by glancing over explanations. It will teach you how to use an obsolete version of the Visual C++ product. It includes a good crash course in OO programming. But it bombs out trying to teach the basics of the MFC. I still don't understand 75% of the code I read. It's a good start, but most readers will have a long way to go with Visual C++."
2,Mystified....,"I went through this book, and only have a slightly better idea of how to use Visual C++ now than before I started. The autor throws technical jargon out so quickly that it can become disorienting, even to a programmer with c/c++ for DOS experiance. The examples given in the book are explained poorly, and some sections of code are skipped over completely."
1,sorry,"This book may have been good back when visual c++ 1 was used but not now, also they just throw the words at you and they don't include a summed up defention of the word. There are lots of other books that are a better buy"
2,Poor,Had camera for just over a year just stopped working ( out of warranty ) by 1 month wanted more to fix than i could get a newer Model No more Nikon Point N Shoots Checked on line Not the only this has happen to
4,Love this camera,"I've used several compact digital cameras through my office. Several are other Nikon models. I bought this one for myself based on price, screen size, & resolution. I've had it a week and I think it is great. I was pleased to find that even the video quality was better than several others I've tried. It will shoot 640x480 video! It comes with a combo USB and TV out cable, so you can plug this right into most TV's to play back the photos and movies.I bought 2SanDisk 2 GB Extreme III SD Memory Cards ( SDSDX3-2048-901 )for about $35 each. Seemed like a good buy to me.My only issues are the display has a smooth surface and stretches right up to the edges, so you can help but get finger prints all over it. Also the cable is big so not very portable since it has 2 RCA's and a USB attached to the camera mounting connector."
4,Goooooood~~!!,I like itI bought camera at first time all my lifeI am satistify. It is goodI always bring it in my pocket and take a picture any time.I recommend this product.Nobody will regret about it.
2,Fallas en las fotos,"Yo compre esta camara, por que a mi criterio las Nikon son buenas, sin embargo esta camara, me causo desilusión, en algunas fotos, aparecen unos puntos blancos, como si fueran agua, malogrando la calidad de las fotos. Hubo algun comentario al respecto anteriormente, pero no le preste atencion, sin embargo me arrepiento no haber hecho caso. Este problema usualmente ocurre de noche. No en el dia. No tengo la foto para adjuntar y puedan apreciar."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!,"I bought this camera about 3 weeks ago, and have used it a total of about 4 times. It might take great photos, but after only a few uses, I discovered an internal error in my camera. Much to my surprise, I thought by paying more money for a camera, it would be of better quality--but truth be told, it was not. The camera started malfunctioning by automatically shutting off after a picture was taken--ON A CHARGED BATTERY, and then it would randomly turn on and shoot pictures like it was possessed. I'm returning it tomorrow"
5,great camera,This camera has great quality it has an awesome 3 inch screen and very light has many modes to chose from for picture taking hope you like it when you get yours
3,Returned due to low picture quality,"The functionality on this camera is phenomenal, but I was disappointed in the quality of the images. They all seemed to be grainy to me.I used the camera for 1 - 2 weeks, then returned it and purchased a Canon SD800IS, which I'm very happy with."
5,It has everything.,"This is my second Nikon camera, and it is absolutely amazing. The pictures are of great quality and the shutter speed is fast, so you don't miss a second. This camera has amazing features such as creating a slideshow with your own music uploaded from your computer as well as great video quality in its compact size. I love the 3 inch lcd screen which displays everything brightly. I strongly recommend this camera."
3,corporate power in united states,I THINK THIS BOOK IS A GOOD BOOK TO READ IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THE MAJOR COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND HOW DO THEY MANAGE THE COSTUMERS FOR THEM TO BUY THEIR PRODUCTS. THERE IS IRONY TOO WHICH MAKES THE BOOK A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING.
4,The Longman Reader 8th Edition,first time ordering online for....ANYTHING...took a while...i didnt kno how to work shipment so tatz my fault but great condition xD
4,square black table,"This table is a perfect match for the chairs. It is very sturdy and easy to set up, no wobbles. The top covering cleans easily with a damp towel,but take care if you smoke.The height is great for anyone under 6ft. tall."
1,A waffle iron that can't make waffles,"This is a truly lousy product -- it doesn't seem to get hot enough to make waffles, the non-stick plates aren't really non-stick, the hinge that holds the two sides together gets deformed with use so that they don't sit right, and the interchangeable plates don't sit very securely.We got this as a wedding present 2+ years ago, otherwise I'd have thrown it out already. I used it today to make sandwiches and got so mad that I went on Amazon just to leave this review. Did I mention that it's also hard to clean?"
1,This waffle iron,"Worse waffle iron I ever owned. Waffles are VERY slow to cook - taking 8-10 minutes each. Waffles stick to iron most of the time, even after brushing with oil. Poor quality control, first one had to go back because of large chunks out of the waffle plates - exposed aluminum. Don't buy at any price."
1,"Great idea, poor product","I love kitchen gadgets and appliances. My Villaware waffler/multi-Baker has been used for less than 2 years. The spring to hold the top plate in place does not hold, even after tightening it. The part to let the top half stand up no longer works. It is difficult to turn the temperature selection dial. Like other consumers, I have noticed everything must be cooked on high. I am quite discouraged with this product."
2,"Useless for waffles, So-so for sandwiches","As other reviewers have mentioned, it takes forever to cook waffles and they just don't come out right. It does make good sandwiches, but the grill/griddle plates clip in with just a single clip and the top one frequently falls out when opening the lid. For safety, wear an oven mitt and don't let kids use it.We still use it to make sandwiches, but we will probably replace it soon. It's more trouble than it's worth."
4,Waffler Review,The product met all expectations. The only small improvement needed would be better clamps to hold the changable plates. It bakes excellent waffles and grills sandwiches perfectly. Clean up is a snap with the removalable plates.
1,Just threw mine out,"After numerous attempts at various heat settings, I could never get the waffles to not stick. I sprayed oil. I brushed oil. No matter what, the lid would get stuck shut so I'd have to split the waffles in half and then spend 15 minutes excavating them from the ridges. I'm on to a new model and am avoiding VillaWare in general."
1,I should have gotten together with another reviewer,I should have gotten together with the reviewer that said that the bottom never cooked because my top never cooked. So if we gerryrigged our machines we could have one perfect machine rather than two lousy machines. I got it at a great price but thank goodness I could return it because noone wants a raw top with an overcooked bottom. Love these Amazon ratings because at least I knew it was the product and not me.
1,"Waffles stick, VERY slow to cook, coating comes off in food",Having the non-stick coating come off on my waffles after just a year of use made me finally toss this in the trash. I already dislike the VERY slow cooking time (twice what my newer hamilton-beach takes) and I also disliked the fact that waffles always stuck unless I sprayed it every time. I won't miss this at all.
1,Disappointed,"I have had this for several years, and it has never worked. The waffles always stick. It doesn't get hot enough. I have had excellent with a much less expensive Toastmaster belgian waffle maker. Unfortunately, the Toastmaster waffles don't fit well in my toaster. It does work adequately for Panini."
4,All day machine,"My kids call this product the ""all day"" machine. We make waffles or pancakes for breakfast, grilled cheese or paninni for lunch and grill chicken or burgers for dinner. We love the waffles because they are as thick as any sunday brunch belgian we have ever had. I no longer need my any other grill because this one ""squeeze the fat out"" and makes us feel good about what we are eating. We also appreciate the ability to adjust the temperature."
1,Unbelievable Waffle Iron - The Waffle Never Bakes,"The red light never worked, the label was pealing off the front of the waffle iron. The waffle on the bottom never cooked, it was more like a rubber tire in texture and was half cooked after 5 minutes.One (1) star is an over rating for this waffle iron..., I've already tried the Krups Waffle Baker (to hard to clean), my next waffle iron to try will be a Chef's Choice Belgian Waffle Iron."
3,"A good idea, but not well executed","This is one of the three waffle irons I own, and it is my least favourite. It's a great idea - an appliance that does several things - if it did them well. A temperature control is important, but I always have to have the waffle maker on the highest setting so it's not very useful. My biggest complaint is the quality of the ""non-stick coating"" - everything sticks from waffles to pancakes (on the griddle) to cheese (from sandwiches on the grill). Then it is impossible to clean - the hardened grease is just going to get thicker over the years. Maybe it will end up ""seasoned"" like a cast iron pan and then the waffles will come out.I'm happier with my Chef's Choice and Grinch (Salton) novelty waffle irons."
1,the worst waffle iron we've ever used,"The main problem with this waffle iron is that the heating is extremely uneven between the top and bottom plates: the waffles often end up being soft on the bottom plate. Worst of all, the majority of the time we've used it, the waffle splits into two, with the two halves completely stuck to either side. When this happens, be ready for an annoying clean up. It's bulky, and without a good control over the temperature settings, I would strongly avoid this iron."
5,Love It!!,"This is not your typical waffle iron. It is one appliance that I use the most in the kitchen. It is not as sturdy as most waffle irons, but the pluses outweigh the minuses. What I like the most is that you can remove the plates completely to wash them. This is my second one, and I like the new featuers. Smooth handles making cleaning easier and bigger feet. I recommend this to anyone with limited space, who needs an appliance that can be used for more than one thing! I have become the gourment grilled cheese and Pannini Queen!"
1,Not Enough Heat,"First review I have ever given on Amazon -- although I am a Amazon Prime member and buy a lot of stuff from Amazon. Great looking piece, but it just doesn't get hot enough to make pancakes (in it's open configuration). It will make waffles if you are willing to wait a very long time and flip the waffles, so they are done evenly. I like the idea behind the design, but the heating element is just poorly designed and too weak. I purchased this as we have a Mickey Mouse Waffle Maker by VillaWare that is great and makes a waffle (one MM waffle) quickly and easily. With my family, waiting 8-10 mins with moving the waffle to get it even just doesn't work. I made waffles today and have gone back to using our basic GE waffle maker, even though it's not Belgian. I would not get this product again and if I could find the box, I'd send it back."
4,"Villaware - Multi-Baker - Belgian Waffle, Raised Rib Grill and Flat Griddl - V6150","I've owned a Villaware Multi-baker before but destroyed the ""teflon"" plates in my dishwasher. It wasn't until I purchased the V6150 that I read you're not supposed to put them in the dishwasher! So far I've only used the flat griddle (for pancakes) and I'm satisfied with the proformance thus far.4 stars only because you can't put the plates in the dishwasher."
5,This product is the best,"The White Rabbit Press flash cards are indeed the best. They are the only kanji cards on the market that provide complete preparation for the kanji portion of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT). There are easy to use and fit nicely into the storage box. Also, White Rabbit Press offers exceptional customer service. There was a problem with my order and they addressed the problem and had the cards shipped in less than 24 hours from initial time of order. I was most appreciative. I highly recommend!"
5,Very cute and well made.,I love this comforter and it exceeded my expectations. It's very well made and worth the price.
4,Really cute set,"I purchase this set for my toddler who is 20 months. He has not gotten into characters but I think it is a really cute set. Sheets are not soft, so this could be a deal breaker for some buyers."
2,Fair to poor,It was not a book that was practical and easy to apply.Had the author been through a grieving experience himself?
5,New Style,Here is the new album of Sir GALWAY. Really bright and fantastic tone and brilliant technic. At all easy and joyfully listenable album. Only difference is: STYLE... yes this is the different style for alltime lovers of Sir GALWAY. strongly recommended!!!
5,great music,"galway, Unger and Mason make nice music. Want to find more to add to our collection. Keep making good music"
3,"Song of Home--I liked Galway, the other two--not so much","It's difficult to say that this is not ""typical"" Galway music, as Galway performs so many types of music with many different orchestras, groups, etc. This was good, but I didn't care much for the singing. Most of the songs reminded me of a depressed era, which may be when these songs originated--I don't know--I just felt rather melancholy after listening to several of the songs."
4,Sometimes it's all you want,"Eitzel runs the gamut from urban folk (Xmas Lights Spin) to this-is-a-single (Cold Light of Day) to actually whimsical (Sun Smog Seahorse), which is his usual gamut, but a fine one nonetheless. The recording of this album is sometimes intimate; it sounds like he's in the room with you on the acoustic solo numbers. The five songs with band accompaniment left me wishing there were more, but on quiet afternoons I'm glad that he left things as they are. As usual, I'm waiting for more."
4,Not quite as good as other titles in the Cap. Coll. Series,"I mainly bought this album due to the fact that other items in the Capitol Collector's Series have original studio outtakes included between the songs, however, Bobby Darin's only included very limited audio of that sort. Although, hearing him warm up before the track Goodbye Charlie was a bit of a treat for me. The version of Wait By The Water was different than what I'd heard before on another Capitol release, so the alternate take was also a plus. My favorite track would have to be Sermon of Samson - which is a nice rockin' bible tale and Mr. Darin sounds quite a bit like Elvis on this particular recording. Overall, this is a good cd, however, due to the more obscure tunes on it, it is not an album that I would want to start a Bobby Darin collection with."
5,Kitschy And Enjoyable,"Bobby Darin had a soulful voice and even though most of these songs are kind of hokey, I always enjoy listening to this album. My favorite track is ""Since You've Been Gone"", it really kicks. ""The Sermon of Samson"" is fun as is ""Wait By the Water"", or as Bobby says it ""de Wada"". ""18 Yellow Roses"" is catchy. And ""When I Get Home"" is kind of funky.These are tracks Bobby recorded in the 60's for Capitol so ""Mack The Knife"" is not included. I guess that is what he is best remembered for, that and ""Splish Splash"". But I like this album and enjoy hearing the quirky tunes."
2,Something is wrong,For any iron butterlfy fan i won't recommended this video the quality is very poor the sound is good but they are not playing live in the studio like the live album i was very dissapointed about this the only album i gave 5 stars is the in a gadda da vida album.
5,In the garden of eden baby!,"I bought this video to see Iron Butterfly perform their signature song, as I listened to it many, many times on ""counterculture"" FM radio stations as a pre-teen in the late 60s-early 70s.Although the video quality is so-so, it has two other songs on it: Easy Rider, and Butterfly Blue, which at almost twenty minutes, is longer than In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida!!If you want to be introduced to the psychedelic era, this is one of the videos to own. The band is one of, if not the first bands to incorporate the themes of heavy (Iron) and light (Butterfly) in their name, ala.. Led Zeppelin."
2,How one stupid thing can ruin totally great product,"I was very, very disappointed by these headphones. Their design is AWESOME.I've never seen any headphones that I liked better in terms of their look. Sound is really good. And when I purchased them I thought that it's my ideal headphones. However they have one stupid design flaw. Their input jack is made of metal and therefore its edges are pretty sharp and it doesn't have a standard soft plastic or rubber sleeve that goes from input jack and don't let cable to rub against input jack edges. So, when you wear your iPod on your belt - cable twists and rubs against a metal edge of an input jack. In 8 weeks cable was basically cut and I wasn't able to repair it. I had different kind of earplugs - iPod stock ones, iPod in-ear plugs, Koss The Plug Ultra etc. and they all lasted for 1-2 years at least. So, I was very very disappointed. If only they will fix this one little issue - I would give them 5 stars. But for now - don't buy them."
5,Great!,"I just got these the other day, and they are my third pair of earbuds, and by far the best. Of course, you cant even compare these to the basic apple ones that come with an iPod, but these are lightyears beyond those. Of all the earbuds that promise 'deep bass' etc, these really truly deliver. Most other earbuds just give you a deep thundering bass that blocks out the rest of the music, but these give a rich bass that melds perfectly with the music. I've listened to just about every genre of music on my iPod with these, classic rock, jazz, blues, metal, classical, and they all sound great through the v-moda earbuds. I'm a professional musician, and I can say, these are the best sounding earbuds, heck, these are even better than most normal earphones that I've used. Totally recomended for anyone that would like high quality earbuds."
4,Well worth the price,"I just received theses in the mail. As stated in previous reviews the sound is awesome, Bass is great, mid range is great, and the high notes do not bust your ear drums out; just try out the ear buds to see witch ones fit your ears the best. They stay in even when working out. I ride a stationary bike a lot and they do not fall out like the ones that came with my ipod. When I rotate back to the states I will try them riding outdoors, I am sure they will perform as stated previously as well. If they had an inline volume adjustment that would make these A-1; bottom line if you are tired of cheap sound and don't want to put up with ear buds falling out , when working out, these are the ones to buy. Well worth the money for quality that is backed up."
2,Nice fit but limited high-end,"I used these on a few bike rides (yes, I know it is dangerous). They fit well and are light. Look pretty good - if that matters.Unfortunately, the bass response was somewhat exaggerated, almost to the point that it was boomy. As well, the treble (high-end) was very limited. Although the mid range was good, the over all effect was dullI have used a pair of Etymotic ER6 Isolator earphones for years, which you can find at about the same price on Amazon. I bought the V-MODA earphone to try something new.Though sound quality is subjective, I feel the Etymotics have less bass, but far superior, crispy, and engaging sound that you should notice immediately. The down side of the ER6 is you have to insert them a little further into the ear than the V-MODAs, which take a little practice and can make you feel more isolated then the V-MODAs. But if you're into biking with tunes cranking, the wind noise is less on the Etymotics."
3,Awesome sound quality and design,"I would love to give this 5 stars for sound quality and design. But, after using this for a couple of weeks, the cap that holds the tip of the jack came off. I was pissed off considering that I used a pair of Sony earbuds lasted about 7 years until I purchased a pair of V-Moda.I must point out the tip that sticks in to the audio jack is way too long which can look awkward on an iPod nano or video. Also, if you're not careful, you might break the tip easily by bumping into it.Other than that, I enjoy the sound quality and the cool design."
3,Best i've had but,These were the best headphones i have ever had. For the first month they were perfect. But after that month they tor. If you rap your headpones around your ipod like i do don't get the black ones. Get the chrome or red ones because they have a different cable then the black ones. Great but not durable
1,Boomy & Muddy,"I used to be the 'super-ears' for a friend who owned stereo stores. Even though my hearing's not as good as that anymore, I can still recognize horribly boomy bass and muddy midrange when I hear it. These phones are like the guy pulling up next to you in the car with dual 15 inch subwoofers blasting out of his back seat. If you like that, you'll like these. I compared them to the ER6-i's from Etymotic Research and these have very poor treble and detail by comparison. They are also inferior in my opinion to the competing 100 dollar Shure product. I returned them..."
1,Shipped Damaged Product,"They shipped me defective headphones, so I have to give them the lowest possible number of stars. To top that off, they would not return or refund the product. The left headphone did not work from day one. How can I, as a customer, be happy about a non-refundable, non-returnable purchase of a defective pair of $80 headphones? I'm not."
2,Not as Expected,"I knew these weren't going to be 'the best.' Even knew that they received some poor reviews from audiophiles. Still, for $100 dollars I expected SOMETHING. I did get SOMETHING: really decent bass. Immediately you can hear every kick and thumb tap that you would ever need to. Unfortunately: it's what these earphones did best and it's all it does. There are no mids and highs. The guitar riffs and cymbals are muffled and lost with the awesome bass. I took them back. Another note that kind of bothered me was the fact the 'Gunmetal Black' are actually gold. Despite even the first product image picture on amazon. I own 'Gunmetal Black' jewelry and it is, in fact: black."
3,Kind of Dispointed,"After those great reviews from here. i thought I gave it a try. How bad luck I had. Its sound quality is really lower than the average base on the high price tag. I have Philips HE-591 with surround sound effect has better wide range performance than this model. Tried many different range and type of earbuds, Sony, Bose, Philips, Sandisk, Mpio, Aiwa. I can feel this one is less bass than most of model I have. Either high freqence and sound clarity is not good at all. Too many details missing from this earbud. For my own openion, this model should have price tag around $30 not 100. It's cheating."
5,Amazing...,I did a lot of reasearch before purchasing these earbuds and for the price I am completely satisfied. I recommend these to anyone looking to upgrade to the $100-ish price point.
3,A let down,"Had high expectations for these earphones considering the rest of the hive's ratings, but I couldn't get myself to like them.Fit: They're uncomfortable and difficult to get situated...and I tried all sizes. To make them stick, they had to be jammed into my ears and that did create a seal...but it was like being pressurized in the cabin of an airplane without the relief of popping.Sound: Unimpressive. I did read somewhere that you need to break them in due to the nature of the product, but even so, due to the pressurized feel, it seemed muffled to me. Also, the seal sends any contact to the headphone's wires as noise up into head-phones...much like a stethoscope.Build: First glance, excellent.So after 48 hours of use I've decided to return them. I will likely switch the JVC or Bose on-ear phones - who knows, maybe I have bizarro ears that don't play well with in-ear phones"
5,Viva la Vibe,"I ride on a daily basis with MTA subway system in NY & with the OEM ipod headphones I could hardly hear any thing when noise levels reached its peak. However,when I tried the vibes today I could for the first time listen to music without having to turn the volume on to maximum level as I had to do before.I'm not a musician so my ears are not sensitive for different frequency responses but I think that for [...] this is a good buy.One more thing;the vibes are comfortable to wear,won't drop from ears like the OEMs & the style is really amazing.I like them!Read the comment for an update on this set :-("
3,"Beautiful Sound. Still Shoddy ""Wiring""","I just bought my second pair of these V-MODA Vibe Earbuds. Unfortunately, I didn't buy them because they're fantastic. I bought them because the first pair broke at the plug after 8 months. They're comfortable. They sound fantastic, especially basses. But I should have paid more attention to those who complained about the plug. However, supposedly I had purchased the ones with the new, reinforced (""V"" plug). Now the right channel no longer works.Truth is the ""open"" inexpensive ($17 I think) Sony earbuds are just as good, and perhaps more comfortable. However, because they're open, others around you cam hear.Remember, I did buy these again, so they must have something going for them. But fair warning, V-Moda didn't improve on design.And would somebody explain how red is more expensive than black even though it's the same earbud? For that matter, explain why red often gets a better rating than black???"
3,"Great Sound, Poor Construction",Great sounds!Crappy construction. Mine broke right after warranty expired.It seems the plastic on the wire stretched and the wire inside is tore off.
3,Not as great as the base version,"I bought this and it broke after use of 2 weeks because I dropped it 4 feet from my arms. I don't blame the headphones though any headphone would break after that fall. These headphones are made of metal so when you place them in your ears they always gave you a chill, plus the ring around the headphone designed to give you a grip on scratches your ears depending on how long you wear them you will notice them.I previously own the BASS v-moda model and I KNOW my old headphones performed better than these in bass. Well obviously (Bass). But the point is you can get better headphones for a fraction of the price and from the same brand.I'd like to make another note that the jack has been fixed so it's stronger than before."
4,Sound is crispy!,I just doesn't have an independent volume control that's why I am giving it only 4 stars.
2,Better deal with Sony's,They do not sound as good as my Sony's which cost less.On par with the Apple phones that come with every IPOD.
3,"Great earphones, ugly pouch","I like the sound of the earphones although I did have to burn them by playing louder than normal music through them overnight.I HATE the ugly metalized champagne color fake leather pouch. I think that the pouch is supposed to look like lame', it just looks lame. For such nice looking earphones they put them in a really horrible looking pouch.I also have a problem with the plug, it is smooth metal and is difficult to grip to unplug, it could use some sort of grip."
4,"Good, but get the next generation","These are really good headphones. I use them on the train ride to work every morning and completely drown out all the crazies. These work great on airplanes too, so you don't have to have the volume all the way up in order to hear your music over the engines. Worth it at full price, a steal at this price.These are the older version. The newer version has a fabric cord instead of this rubbery stuff. The jack is also constructed slightly better on the newer generation. However, those aren't knocks on these headphones, just illustrating why I think the next gen ones are better. The sound quality is identical, so it's merely a matter of price and style preference. Either way, these are a good buy. The biggest drawback with the newer ones is that they have a tendency to stop working in one ear within a year or so. I haven't experienced that yet with these...fingers crossed."
4,great iems,vibes are good iems for the price. it matches well with the shure case that amazon also sells. to me its a fun iem that i really have nothing to complain about. i later upgraded to the ue super.fi 5 pros which i find are a lot better like 2.5x which is what it will cost u. i think these are worth the money
2,Poor Design,"First the good:They sound okay but not for 75 + dollars.The bad:Poor design, I am on my second pair and the same thing happened with these that happened with the first. The cladding on the wires pulled away from the ear buds exposing the cables. First time it was on both buds, now it is just on the left one. For the amount of money this is completely unacceptable. Common sense - reinforced boot on the wire where it connects with the ear bud. Unfortunately this is not the case, save your money and pass on these. I did not even send the second pair back I was so disgusted. Oh, and the gun metal colored ones are not gun metal, they are a bad shade of green."
3,"Great sound, lousy construction","I got these earbuds 2 months ago, and after using them daily in a normal fashion, the cable has started fraying and ripping at both the plug end and the earbuds. That's not the kind of thing you'd expect with buds at this price range, and I hope that the company reads these reviews and does something about it. To be fair, I emailed them about it and they're sending me a replacement, no questions asked.Sound quality however, as others have already commented on, is excellent. Just handle them with extreme care, I guess."
4,"A little pricey, but good sound","I'll admit - I enjoy trying new earbuds and headphones. I bought the V-Moda's primarily because I liked the looks of them and secondarily because they were rated highly at Amazon, CNET, and other sites.They are becoming one of my favorite sets. The bass is a little heavy at times. I prefer the brightness of theEtymotic Research ER6i Isolator Earphones (White), but overall I think I like the V-Moda's better. They also seem to be sturdier; I worry about the Ety's, although they've lasted fine for me thus far. They're superior to my ears to my Bose In-Ear Headphones, and they stay in better.Earphones are a personal thing, I believe, and no set well please everyone, but I've been very happy so far with these."
5,V-Moda Is a Fine Earphone for A Good Price,"Not an audiophile but did enough research to settle on the V-Modas. Was a little hesitant because of all the talk about ""burn in"" but as far as I am concerned the sound was full, resonant and satisfying from the very beginning, certainly compared to the earphones that came with the Nano, and got better over time.Highly recommend. Good bass and good resolution."
3,Not as good as the reviews...,"After loads of research and review readings I finally decided to try the Vibe earphones. I had very high expectations so I got a bit disappointed when I first listened to my new earbuds - it turned out my 10 years old, $15 Sony earphones still sounded slightly better! I gave the Vibes a couple of days but in the end I decided to return them. That said they are good earphones, very comfortable and quite balanced sound but to me for the $100 I paid I wanted an upgrade from what I currently have so it didn't make any sense to keep them... Keep in mind when reading all the reviews that we all have very different requirements and taste so the best way to find a good fitting and sounding pair is to go out and listen or make sure you can return the product if you are not satisfied.../Adrian"
2,Cable creates an extremely distracting+annoying scratching sound when it rubs against fabric,"i have had the headphones for a few weeks and assumed i would get used to the annoying scratching sound--just cannot. have been spoilt by my previous bose headphones with their lame cables, i confess (the sound was crystal clear). i will probably revert to bose as i am unlikely to get used to the scratching that completely distracts me from the music."
3,Died after a tiny bit of gym use,"I used these for a couple of months before I accidentally wore them while doing cardio at the gym, and a small amount of sweat was enough to kill em dead."
1,Defective on arrival...,"Got these headphones today and found out on first wear that the right earbud was defective. When I inserted the right earbud into my ear it crinkled and cracked like an aluminum can being crushed. The noise was absolutely intolerable! The grating sounds may have been coming from a diaphragm in the bud b/c the noise became even worse whenever I shifted the bud in my ear. Also, the sound in the right bud was muffled. This defect is a shame because the left-side bud performed very well in the few listens I attempted. The buds seem to be a bit bass heavy, and with the Comply foam tips I got for them, the tight (yet comfortable) seal provided even more response on the low end. Construction (aside from the defective right bud) seemed solid enough - the jack was angled, not straight like in the photos. Overall, I really wish the pair I received was not defective. These buds showed a lot of potential."
2,"Good Headphones, Low Quality - Broke After 4 months","Title says it all. At first I loved these headphones, great sound, snug fit, blocked out excess sound. 4 months later the bass is gone, and now I am stuck with high's for headphones. NOT A RECOMMENDED PRODUCT. FYI, I had bought VMODA headphones previously that did the same thing but they at least lasted about 1 1/2 years. The gunmetal black ones were actually more expensive, thinking they would last longer. Boy was I wrong!"
2,"Good sound, bad casing","These earphones sound pretty good. Not quite the Shure E2c's I had previously, but not bad and were more comfortable. My main problem with them is the casing. I purchased mine on March 1st, by May 1st, the casing at the top of the jack hasbroken and you can see the wiring inside. Now I have to send them in for a replacement.They sound good, but at the end of the day (or at the end of 2 months), they are a waste of money."
3,V-Moda Ear Buds,"The buds looks great but is a little pricey for what it is. The cord is a little too short and the rubber tends to pull on your clothes (It makes the buds come out). I want to be able to put it behind my head instead from the front but you can't do that (It's not engineered that way). I tend to yank on the cords when I run. For something fashonable these are for you, otherwise go to Fry's you'll find something better."
5,BASS! Tis Buds hav Bass,"I have been a avid bass player for over 30 years and I need and wanted my ears bud to produce a rice low sound Feq. After trying very expensive sets of Sony and Shure buds my heart was won over by the V-Moda VIBE Buds.They have all the bass I need but if you do try out these teeny tiny miracles you need to make sure your MP3 player or other player has a EQ. The VIBE buds need to be fine-tuned.Now while riding my lawn mower, all I can say is WOW!ROCK ON"
5,Amazing sound,I've been using the earbuds for a month now and it is really good. I agree that the color is not black and that the pouch is a joke but the quality is really there.These earbuds reveal all the subttle details in the music that I haven't heard before. The only downside of using the V-MODA of course is that now I need to start thinking of re-ripping my music using a lossless encoder so I won't hear the imperfections of compression! I will soon need a terabyte big iPod :|
3,Too stylish for their own good,"These have a good sound, and are overall a nice set of buds. Unfortunately, the lack of a rubberized grip on the plug forces you to unplug them by tugging on the cable most of the time. After a couple months of this, the protective rubber on mine has severed. Now the only thing keeping it all together is the bare wire.If you do decide to get these, I'd suggest wrapping some electrical tape around the plug from the beginning."
1,Don't last very long,"After getting frustrated with the long thick cord on my Shure E2c earphones, I found the V-MODA Vibes to be much easier to manage. The cord is a better length for me and is soft, thin and lightweight. However, the first pair lost sound on one side after a few months of light use. I vowed to be more careful with the second pair, but to no avail. I'm back to my Shures. :("
5,Pricing,"I can not understand the change in pricing in 30 days. My first purchase of 60 tabs was 34.39 then I go back to reorder and the best price, from another company, was over $50.00 and this company was more. Believe me I love my 12 year old lab BUT do not have a lot of money! Stacie"
5,Spatula,My wife LOVES this spatula! She had one for years and was looking for an extra for our grand daughter. VERY sturdy and tough!
2,Rubbermaid Spatula,Just much too large for kitchen use. Don't know exactly where you would use this in a home kitchen. I returned it. No problem with the refund.
1,arrrrgh!,"Received the product - it was incorrectly fulfilled and they looked used / dirty besides - in the process of returning them - apparently the description on the QTY was incorrect, listed as a case of QTY 36, filled as a SINGLE item QTY 1- AMAZON should have either cancelled the order or filled it as advertised / as ordered and as payed for - arrrgh!!! Now I have to do the returns AND wait for my CC to be reimbursed -"
3,Great spoon shape/Too short handle,"Rubbermaid is one of my favorite brands and I love-like others-that the handle is sealed to the spoonula, thus eliminating food getting stuck in the connection. I do wish that it had a longer handle to keep my hand out of the bowl while I'm using it. Also a smooth handle without the ridges for food to get caught in would be nice."
1,Awful,Very misleading advertisement. Will not honor their mistakes. Product arrived scratched and dirty. I ordered two cases and received one lousy spatula that was complete junk. NEVER AGAIN!
5,great review,"I was surprised on how well this was done. Better then ""official"" reviews use to be. All the races are covered, try watching without commentary, just enjoy the engine noises. If you're into F1, buy this."
4,"You won't ""like"" it, but you aren't supposed to.","_Walking on Glass_ is one of those books you appreciate but don't enjoy, because it's not designed to be an enjoyable book. It's intentionally frustrating, depressing, and manipulative, but as that sort of book goes it's a masterpiece. Even _The Wasp Factory_ is entertaining, in a really sick, black-humor way, but this is different.It's also amazingly complex-- there are three plots whose characters do not ""meet"" in a traditional sense, yet the plots are undoubtably linked. Don't dismiss the idea as a mere ""experiment-for-experimentation's-sake""-- this novel was clearly planned from the first word, it does have structure, and if you pay attention it comes together in the end. It's difficult to read in every way, but do it anyway. I didn't ""like"" it, but it was brilliant."
5,a great read,This book is a quasi-preumbrilative dissedant view on the overwhelming twisted trajectories of love and mistrust.You will never trust another after reading it-detritus bunion ormaphaligionation.
2,Terrible translation,As I read I could see how it might have been written in French. The English just doesn't read quite right. The book could've used a more skillful translation.
4,4 Pc. Toaster Ovenware Set - All you'll ever need!,"If you own a toaster oven like I do, this set of toaster ovenware is all you will ever need! Quick and easy to clean nonstick surface. However, DO NOT place in dishwasher.This Product is great for college students just starting out. The toaster-ovenware is just the right size to prepare a meal for one person, maybe two.Since this product was given to me as a gift. I hardly ever use the oven anymore.Not being ""dishwasher safe"" is my reason for the 4 star rating. Otherwise great product!"
5,What a great set,"This is a great toaster oven set for anyone who uses their toaster oven. I feed a family of 4 and I've used the casserole pan to cook many things - baked apples, au gratin potatoes, mac and cheese - it's great. The food does not stick to any of the pieces. They are nice and sturdy and clean very easily. I highly recommend this set - especially in the heat of the summer when most of us don't want to turn on our ovens!"
4,water Filter,"Kind of a no brainer, needed filter, found good price through Amazon, received the item and it installed with no issues, good filtered water, no leaks...end of story."
5,best water filters,"Since I do not like to poison myself with flouride and all the other toxins allowed by the federal government, I use this type of undersink filter to clean my city tap water. These are good prices on high quality filters."
1,Not as described and not the same filter as in the picture.,The filters I received do not look like the one pictured in the description (and not the cb3 that I need to use in my water filter).The original cb3 has only one opening to the inside cylindrical channel and the filter I received is open on both ends. As a result not all the water will not be forced through the filter as is necessary.
2,Older Model,"This is an older model with lower flow rate. You want the Series B. The description of this should be more accurate or at least state it's a Series A. Overall though, it still fits and works."
3,;0),"Filter Cartridge fits good and installation was easy for me. The water pressure runs smoothly and a bit heavy which is a good thing. Of course, what I don't like compared to the last filter I had this one should be changed after 4 months and you will know when it needs changing. The water pressure gets so low after 4 months that you can barely use."
2,Plastic casing cracked,"The plastic casing for the cartridge was cracked. Hopefully this isn't a systemic issue, I probably just had bad luck in getting a cracked one. My filtration system broke right before I received this refill, so I didn't have a need for it anyway."
4,"Otherwise, it would be a perfect transaction","I received a wrong product initially. After I contacted the company, they apologized for the mistake and sent me the right one with a return label. So it took longer than it should be. ."
2,NO SHOW,They did not have in stock what they said they had. Other than that I thought they were wonderful.
2,more a buddy movie than a climbing movie,"If your interest is Mount Everest and mountain climbing; skip this movie. On the other hand, if you are interested in watching a Canadian buddy picture (based on an actual event); than maybe this movie is worth your time. Overall, for me, a few real mountain images interspersed amongst many predictable and formatted staged scenes does not lend itself to a rewarding or enjoyable movie experience."
4,Slow-Moving But Excellent Way To Learn Superb Pilates Technique!,"I used this video to learn Pilates technique at a more expert level. I wanted to know why and how, not just go through the motions. If you want very careful and precise knowledge of Pilates technique, this is a great option. If you want to go through a faster-paced Pilates routine, there are other options you might like better."
2,"Method is good, video not as good","I bought this video because my Pilates instructor uses the Stott method and he is fantastic. Unfortunately the video isn't as good. it's a bit boring and Ms. Stott's words or voice is not very inspiring either. I would recommend the Stott method, but not this video."
4,"Too much expectation, but under delivered","I had too much expectation on this book based on the ratings that I saw for this book here... I must say I am disappointed. Don't get me wrong that the book itself is not a disappointment, but clear word of caution, before buying this book: (1) This book is not for beginners of .NET, (2) This book does not talk all major parts of .NET. Some important topics of .NET, to the point, with a palatable code example. Think before you buy it!"
1,Stupid,"Hey! Let us get together. Find a cabin in the woods. Get eight people. Four of the women with very nice built bodies. Have some very hot nude scenes. Have a ""Round""? Oija board. Have a creature that looks like a giant burrito with teeth and you have ""Malefic"" A stupid move that is filmed in gray and white even though they said it was color. A movie that is about as scary as a bowl of yellow jello. Not much of a complex plot. A weird creature is summoned when three gothic people (who get their costumes from the local witchcraft store)play around with a round Oija board. Throw in some nude scenes with some big breasted very muscular legged women and you have your movie. That is all there is to the thing. Very stupid and boring."
2,"Good research, but not enough personal experience","As a mother of a child with multiple disabilities, I don't feel that Ms. Lavin has enough personal experience with raising a disabled child to emotionally connect with the reader and provided needed information. She is the mother of a daughter with a cleft lip/palate, which in and of itself is indeed a difficult experience, but one which I don't consider to be a disability. Her child can have surgery and wear makeup; my child is severely disabled and will be for life. Raising a special-needs child requires an emotional connection to others in the same situation- sort of a ""been there, done that, say-no-more"" attitude. I didn't feel any sort of empathy in her writing.However, she did to her homework by speaking to many parents. I did benefit somewhat from the chapter regarding financial decisions and wills/trusts.All in all, I would advise other parents looking for guidance to save your valuable time and pass this book by."
5,Great Book for Parents,"Parents, especially with autistic youngsters, need this book. It provides comforting and reassuring information to parents who are often confused and angry after a severe diagnosis. I also had a chance to interview Judith on my radio show on Newsradio 1330-WHBL in Sheboygan. She is a very articulate and talented advovate for parents. Thank you for writing this book, it will do a lot of good in the world!!Sincerely,Jeffrey McAndrewAuthor of ""Our Brown-Eyed Boy"""
4,Praise,"As a teacher, I have encountered children with disabilities. This book has given me a clearer insight into the problems confronting parents with children with disabilities. Virginia Schultheis"
2,Not recommended,"The fact that the author has a daughter with cleft lip/palate does not mean she has experience raising a disabled child. It is hard to find the empathy between the lines. While raising a disabled child is not a prerequisite for aquiring knowledge on the subject, if experience is mentioned at all, it should be relevant."
4,Seeing is believing,"I was a little skeptical at first, mainly because of the price. I have used this lens a number of times and I am slowly falling in love with it. I use a tripod with it for balance when I can. The photos are great. I enjoy it very much. It is a little heavy but not bad at all. Get it and be surprised as was I. It is amazing just how far you can go with this lens."
3,Design and Construction of Sheet-Piled Cofferdams,"It is a comprehensive treatise on cofferdam design and construction as it is done in England. It does not contain much on marine cofferdams, cofferdams surrounded by a potentialy nasty environment. I did not find it of much value for me, a practicing marine construction engineer with 50 years of experience. That is why I authored, ""Underwater Construction Using Cofferdams,"" now available from BEST PUBLISHING COMPANY. My book describes what a contractor's engineer has to be aware of when designing marine cofferdams. Of course, engineers working in the metric system and with software design aids will not enjoy looking at my long-hand calculations unless they want to understand what they are unknowingly doing when they go to the computer."
4,Pleasing collection,"""The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" was like a breath of fresh air. Lately I have come across some anthologies which just aren't up to par as far as the quality of the plots. These stories I found to be entertaining and fun to read. Two which stood out for me were ""Shadows on the Lawn"" and ""The Return of the Speckled Band"". There's even a story in there for Watson lovers, ""The Doctor's Case"", penned by none other than Stephen King. Though there were a few which I didn't really care for, this is a worthwhile read."
3,Buy it for the pictures,"The long awaited oeuvre of Mr. Adams has finally arrived, and is sitting handsomely on many Coffee Tables around the world. Exquisite photgraphy. It is unfortuante that many of the details within the text are inaccurate, and it's a shame that the author was not more careful with his research. However a very pretty book to own - buy it for the pictures. Enjoy Mr. Adams stories (for they are that).What is intersting is that the owners of the cover (limestone) property are defacing THAT building as we write this. Metal Windows now everywhere. Whats a shame that the present owners of these structures cannot appreciate the efforts, craft and care of the original European Architects of Harlem. So it might serve to document the continuing erosion of a once handsome place."
4,Fascinating,As a native new yorker and a harlem resident of four years...I was intrigued by this book and recommend it along with harlem style.

1,Wrong cast,"This is NOT the 1952 Broadway Cast Recording. This is the movie soundtrack which was made around 1962. They scrapped half the original songs and inserted a few others not in the original show. Didn 't care for the movie, which got poor reviews, inspite of Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth. Also, Jane Froman is NOT on this album.I did see the 1952 Broadway revival which was excellent. That album is also on Amazon under a different listing. I bought it and was very pleased. I hope Amazon corrects the listing information.This was not the fault of the seller. The movie version is listed wrong and all sellers."
2,Some marriage counseling.LOL!,This movie was ok.I guess I expected more considering it was from the makers of HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME.But it was ALRIGHT.
3,Ain't what they used to be,"The first pan arrived bent totally out of round, due to shipping. The second pan is fine, but not nearly as well made as the Revereware pans made in the USA several decades ago."
3,"Quality does not match the name ""Revere""","I purchased the 12-inch skillet about 1 month ago and I was somewhat disappointed. The name ""Revere"" is associated with quality but this product is below the standard. The handle was shaking and it is not as sturdy as my old Revere skillet purchased about 10 years ago whose handle is still holding firmly. It's a good product but not of a high quality. That's why I gave it 3 stars."
2,Coating doesn't last long,It must have been over twenty years ago when I first purchased this product and I loved it then. The size of the skillet was perfect and it stayed coated a long time. But now I feel that Revere Wear must have changed their way of making this skillet. The coating doesn't last long at all. Before long everything sticks to the pan. Though I love the size of the pan I would no longer purchase this product. It's not worth it to publish something that stops from being a nonstick skilet in such a short time.
4,revere 12 inch skillet,This product is awesome. I have had it over a year now.. and it stil has no scratches. Very heavy and sturdy. Highly recommend.
5,Outstanding.,I love it. I have both the 10 and 12 inch. I love them and ive had no problems at all with either.
2,Not what it used to be,"I ordered this skillet even with the mixed reviews because I loved the previous one I have had for more than 10 years. This one is definitely not going to last that long. After one dinner use, the handle is already loose. It feels very flimsy compared to my old one. I will use it until it falls apart but I won't be replacing it with another one. This was such a disappointment. I just hope the teflon coating is not going to come apart as quickly as the handle. The teflon coating was the problem with my old one & I had to replace it. I am not getting any more w/teflon coatings & am sticking with the ss versions."
4,Great for the price,"I received this as a Christmas gift along with the 12"" lid. It was my first really decent skillet, so I didn't know what to expect, but it has really fared well in my kitchen. I make 1 dish meals for two, chicken parmesean, pancakes, anything really and clean up couldn't be easier. My one complaint is that it doesn't always cook evenly, so I'm constantly rotating. You don't need high temps to get quick results. As for the lid, the handle broke off shortly after getting it, so unfortunately, I need to buy a new one (which seems a little overpriced if you ask me!) But the price for this pan is worth what you get, a more-than-decent skillet for those ""just starting off""."
1,Pretty cheapy skillet,"I got this pan hearing that RevereWare was a good brand. When I brought it back home to try out, the pan had warped within just a few weeks of using it. After doing a little more research, it seems that RevereWare products USED to be high quality but not really anymore.I would not recommend this pan to anyone looking to get one."
1,REVEREWARE AINT WHAT IT USED TO BE,"Revereware used to be really good, now it's made in China and the quality is terrible. This pan was so out of round that my lid would not fit on it. And the aluminum was so thin and cheap. Just a lousy pan all the way around. I promptly sent it back. I got great pan at TJ Max for $25. Amazon shouldn't even sell crappy merchandise like this."
1,misshapened pan,"By the time I threw away all the return materials I realized the pan was bent and the lid didn""t fit !! Still can use it too much hassle to return JSurgen"
1,Poorly Manufactured,"When I received the package with the 12"" skillet in it, there was no indication from either the external packaging or the box that actually contained the skillet that any damage had been done to either during shipping. However, the pan was out of round. One side of the pan was pushed in towards the middle of the pan. There was no indication that the pan was damaged in that the telflon surface was intact and the pan inself was not dented. Therefore, I assume that the pan was not manufactured properly in the first place and there was apparently no quality control inspection of the skillet to ensure that it had been manufactured to proper specifications. Since the pan could not be used with the 12"" skillet lid that I already had, I had threw it away. This is the first time I have purchased an item from Amazon.com that was faulty to the extent that it was not usable."
2,Disapointing,"The product arrived dented, I think we returned it twice and finally just settled for what we received. There is no lid that fits this thing...making some tasks impossible. The handle looks like its of poor quality, I really expected more of revere ware"
1,Religious bias prejudices everything she says.,"I was glad to find this book in the stacks at Robarts Library at the University of Toronto because I wanted to see an analysis of Kinsey's methodology and results. But the first thing I noticed was Reisman's assertion that Kinsey's data on homosexuality came from men who had been to prison. I have penpals in prisons, and I know that the popular idea that men turn to homosexuality in prisons is a myth. Reisman's book cannot stand on its own because of her religious bias. You cannot credit what she says, and what is still needed is an objective analysis of the Kinsey Report."
1,The witch hunt continues,"This is one of a series of strident and hysterical books by Reisman in which she continues to make a career out of Kinsey-bashing. Her opinions are tailored to meet the wishful thinking of a readership of very conservative Christians. She could just as easily have written books attacking Darwin or any of the other Usual Suspects. She chose Kinsey as the figure to demonize. She presents him and his associates as devils, and she does everything short of trying to prove that they were Satanists. One is reminded of the old books about witchcraft in which the witches are presented as guilty of every possible abomination."
1,Nonstick Coating Flaking Off,"I REALLY loved this when I first got it, so I was supremely disappointed when the nonstick coating began flaking off, essentially rendering it unusable. I may have gotten a bad batch or something. The product has a lifetime warantee and I do intend to send it back in, but wanted to let folks know about my experience."
2,Non-Stick Interior Flaked off after 1st use,"I was so happy to find this pan because I needed something to replace the pan that came with my toaster oven. Unfortunately, after one use I was not so happy. The non-stick coating came off in sections. I washed it by hand, using gentle dishwashing liquid, so it should not have happened. After seeing the flaking, I'm afraid the non-stick coating will come off onto the food I'm cooking, so I haven't used it since without lining it with aluminum foil. I have quite a bit of Nordic Ware and I'm really disappointed that they would put out such a shabby product."
2,B MOVIE AT BEST,I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE IT LISTS ADRIAN PAUL AS SOMEONE STARRING IN IT. IF YOU CONSIDER A MOVIE OVER AN HOUR AND 20 MINUTES LONG THAT HE HAS (3) 30 SECOND LITTLE BIT BLURBS IN...THEN YES- HE STARS IN THIS MOVIE. I DONT. IF YOU WANT TO SEE A POST HIGHLANDER ADRIAN PAUL MOVIE- TRY LOST COLONY OR POSEIDON. I WONT SPOIL THE MOVIE AS IT PERTAINS TO THE REST OF THE CAST. THE STORY IS NOT UNFAMILAR AND SOMEWHAT PREDICTABLE. THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS DO AN ACCEPTABLE JOB. UNFORTUNATELY- THE ENDING IS ONE THAT ANYONE CAN SEE COMING.
4,product good but overly priced,It is a wonderful product but at $12.00 for one mop refill is way too high.I would say 3-4 dollars would have been alright. So I guess there's no chance of meordering it again. I was expecting at least 9 pcs for 3 orders.
2,ZERO battery life!,"I bought a RAZR for my wife a year ago, when Cingular had a monopoly on them and the price was 4x what it is now (silly me!). It's very stylish and syncs via Bluetooth with the car nicely. But the battery life on this phone SUCKS! I've read several reviews noting that it needs to be charged every day -- which, IMO, is ridiculous for any cell phone these days; but I've found that this POS needs to be charged sometimes 2x or more per day, without what I would consider to be extraordinary use.I worked for Motorola for years and know they are capable of making a much better product. My gut tells me that they once again put form before function on this phone. Real disappointing."
1,Still waiting for my $150 refund - five months and counting,The phone is o.k. One piece of the adaptor to charge the phone was not working on delivery. Cingular would not exchange the part and blamed Amazon and said good luck getting the part from them.Five months have gone by and I am still waiting for my rebate.
4,Razr Lady,"I just purchased the Razr and have to admit when I first saw the commercial I wanted the phone, even before I knew what features it had. Plus I wanted something no one else had. Now that I have it I LOVE IT. I love that it is small and compact. It has great camera, the reception is awesome (although it can sound like there is an echo-doesn't bother me though), overall it's great.Minor gliches, multiple entries for one person (does anybody have suggestions for this?) and smudge marks (constanly wiping phone:)-. The price is high, but if you get it on Amazon you get the amazing rebate, which then puts the phone in the price range of all the others out there. Other than these I have not run into any major problems. I recommend the phone to anyone who likes gadgets, like myself!"
3,"Great Phone, rebate sucks!","First of All, the Razr has been a delight to own. My only complaints are the available receiver volume (too low) and its tendency to turn off if you bang it a little hard. (The battery can be reseated and everything's grand.However, after 8 months, I finally heard back from my rebate. For reasons not explained, I was ineligible for any rebate.Just be careful!"
1,Don't buy this phone with Cingular,"I have really bad reception with this phone.It disconnected by itself all the time.Usually I get less than 2 bars for signal.I returned it and got new one. But new one is worse!!Amazon sent me refurnished one.If someone want to buy from different store with different service,I recommand it.The phone looks so nice and has fun features."
2,"Don't buy it, just don't.","This phone was one big waste of money. I am a college student so $350 was a big chunk of change for me and it wasn't worth it. Shortly after I got the phone it started acting crazy and of course, my company didn't have insurance on it. Now it doesn't work and I'm totally out a phone. I will never buy from moto again."
3,Read the fine print!,"Beware! Offer only good if you are starting a brand new account. You cannot use this for a second or third line phone, or a upgrade, you will get a $250.00 charge."
1,Very expensive mistake.,"We were so impressed by the RAZR design that our office bought six of them a few months ago (when the price was $400) and switched to Cingular. We've had trouble with all seven (a couple guys have been through multiple phones). The problems range from things not fitting properly (battery cover, key pad) to crazy behavior such as the phone rebooting every time a call is received.Cingular couples a bad phone with bad service. To them, everything is the customer's fault. When you have a problem with the phone (which you will), Cingular grills you trying to determine if they can blame your phone's problems on you.Additionally, and I can't speak about anywhere but Utah. If you live in Utah STAY AWAY FROM CINGULAR. They say the coverage is good. It is not even close to tolerable.Do yourself a favor and stay as far away from the RAZR AND Cingular as you possibly can."
3,Lots of good features - cannot handle moisture,"This was a great phone for me for about 6 months. It's small, light, can handle being dropped now and then, and has easy keys to see and use. I took it for a short bike ride (maybe 30 mintutes). Since I didn't have pockets, I put it against my skin under elastic. I perspired lightly, but it was enough to kill the phone. It partially revived with several keys not working. ...hope that helps any potential buyers. Keep it very dry!"
3,Motorola RAZR V3 Phone,"I have the phone and it is okay. It is a bit big though, even though itz thin."
1,"not for phone, for not working here","it doesnt work in pittsburgh...it would have been a really cool phone...but it doesnt work in pittsburgh...why not make it work nation wide?...now i need to get a crappy 50 dollar phone instead of a nice one like this............other good phones have bad plans that are too expensive...this has a good plan, but it doesnt work here...THANKS MOTOROLA"
3,For the price...,"Yes this is an amazing looking phone. I get comments on it all the time, but for the price and the features i dont think the phone is worth over $100. If you have the money then buy it, but the free phones w/ 2yr work just as good. This phones has a nice camera w/4x zoom but no video funtion, and the speaker is nice and clear on it. But if i could go back in time to when i purchased it i would have rather gotten the free phone like my two sisters did, and leave with money in my pocket."
3,high cost & no headset wow,"nice phone very thin but so wide, non sense... high cost then no headset included dont buy at current price.In few months it will be free with 1 year contract. I,m still amazed cingular didn,t offer a headset with phone."
4,V3,This is a great phone however it is lacking streaming video. Yes it will play small video trailers and music videos. But it is lacking the quality of other contenders in the same high end market for the top of the line tech items. Motorola should have learned by now what the people want and what they will pay for... These phones unlocked will work with numbers of providers and as to the lack of video it makes up for in quality of manufacturing and the style is sleak and futuristic...
3,Great?,I bought this phone and had it for a day but decided to return it. It just wasn't what i expected. The design was okay but the keypad was a bit rough. I didn't think that it was worth what i paid. and it wasn't very user friendly if a person hadn't ever used a motorola before and even for me it was a bit weird
2,Port Your Old Number - You Lose the Rebate,BE CAREFUL!! If you have an old existing phone number and you want to bring it to this new phone - IT WILL VOID THE REBATE!!The only place this is mentioned is at www.amazon.com/keep-your-number.
3,WARNING - ROTTEN BATTERY LIFE! Great form factor!,"The #1 reason to buy (and keep) this phone is the slim form factor. Let's face it - for guys who don't like to keep the phone on their belt like a pager, a pants or suit pocket is the only option. This phone is far and away the best one in that regard. I forget it's there a lot of the time. It is also built EXTREMELY solidly, and does NOT scratch easily, although the SCREEN scratches easily.However, the battery life is terrible. I literally have to charge it every night after less than two hours of talking with bluetooth. You MUST get the car charger immediately. Even though I had bought one on the internet, I couldn't wait for it because the phone kept dying so I raced to a local cingular store for an intermediate car cord.The Motorola HS-850 BT headset is great but occassionally loses connection w/the phone, which is frustrating.The only reason I kept this phone is the size."
4,good phone but no accessories,"i have had this phone for 2 weeks now and i liked the look and feel of the phone. i use the phone only as a phone and not as a digital camera; so i will not comment on that.good:1. really slim. no more bulges in your formal trouser pockets.2. sound levels - speakerphone sound level is very good. i would have liked to have higher handset volume.3. charging - takes very less time to charge and also is very convenient to talk while charging if you use the little connector that they provide. that was a good idea...whoever thought of it, did a good job there.not so good:only one thing...no accessories with this phone. at this price they should have provided us with atleast a headset. so for all the money that you spend, you get just the little phone. NOTHING comes with it. :(this is a good phone...go for it if you can afford it."
2,"Fancy yes, but not worth it","Okay, it's really cool that the screen is pretty big, the pictures are really clear for a phone and the phone is really stinking thin. All that being said, if you need a basic phone to talk on, this is not the phone for you. And definitely not at the cost of it. Unless you have the phone pressed as close to your ear as possible, it's hard to hear the other person. As a topper, it's either an expensive handsfree or another expensive handsfree (neither of which fit smaller ears). I'd rather I had stuck with my v551 bluetooth."
1,this phone is way to fragile,I had the phone for a month and was satisfied but when one of my friends dropped it it broke. this is an ok phone but just be sure not to drop or it will break the second it hits the ground
4,Good Phone,Ive had my razr for about 4 months now. at first it felt like it would break easily but its pretty solid. My one complaint is the screen. Somehow it got really scratched up and all kinds of dust got behind it which i cant figure out how to remove. good phone though.
1,IT BREAKS ALL THE TIME!!!,"Ok, so I bought into the hype about the Razr when it first came out. Now, however, I HATE THIS PHONE. IT HAS CAUSED ME NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS. Due to the fact that it is so slim, the wires are super thin as well and constantly break. It costs a lot to fix, including a day off of work to travel the extensive distance to someone who knows how to fix it. Then I finally got fed up with the phone breaking and decided to buy a new one, a completely different brand, but Cingular said I wasn't ready for an ""upgrade"" so I had to pay full price! I got screwed... beware the Razr (and any Motorola products for that matter--their Blue Tooth headsets are no better!!! Even my boyfriend who works for Moto won't buy their products!)"
3,Phone is very nice. Cingular service is very bad.,"I had this phone for a few days and I really liked it for what it is. The main advantage of the phone is the design and the size. It fits nicely in pockets and you forget it's there. Functionality is ok - you've probably already read the specs. There are phones out there that can offer more on that side though.Here comes the bad part. Cingular service was way below my expectations. The reception and the quality was very bad. Phone calls were dropping on a regular basis. Customer service wasn't very helpful either. Eventually, I had to return the phone. Currently I use T-mobile with Motorola A630 and I am very very happy with the service. If T-mobile has good reception in your area then that is the way to go."
3,Great look: Battery power HORRIBLE,"yes I agree with most of you: the RAZR is definitely sleek looking and such. I've barely had it for a month and already I'm disappointed. Seems I am always charging this phone even though I do not 'clock in the time'. The large screen is great; the fact you can put it in your backpocket and almost forget it's there is nice, too. But so far I am not impressed.. yes Nokia does make better phones...."
1,Like every other Motorola phone.,Okay my mom Bought the RAZR and i bought the sony ericsson z500a and the ericsson is 10x better. The RAZR does have a really good camera though. But the RAZR has virtually no additional features compared to the other MOTO's! DON'T BUY IT!
2,Great reception,"We live in a ""low to med."" coverage area and this phone provides service in areas most other phones do not."
2,Beware AT&T Customers!!!,"While AT&T might have been acquired by Cingular, their systems are not integrated. I had an existing plan with AT&T and bought this phone since my physical bill now says Cingular. When I tried to put my existing SIM chip into the Razr, it displayed ""contact Service Provider"" when I turned it on. After calling AT&T support, they say that I need to spend an additional $25 to get a Cingular SIM card - that the AT&T cards don't work with this phone.!!!!! BEWARE of the hidden costs!!!!"
1,Buyer beware.... this phone is Fragile!,"I have had my phone since Mar '05 and it has been in for service twice, once for a cracked lens and now for moisture problems.Both times the phone was in my front pocket wasn't dunked in water, etc.I am not hard on phones. I had my previous StarTac phones for about 4 years, no service problems, but it was starting to wear out....was having problems sending/receiving calls.If you doubt what I am saying, drop this phone or go jogging with it in your shorts pocket.... it will soon be in for service (or just plain OUT OF SERVICE.Save your money... go elsewhere."
1,worst phone I've ever had,"You think it will be great because of the features and size but this is garbage. If you accidentally drop it, it falls apart. The battery that came with the phone is the worst I've ever had. Within 6 months of having it I noticed the battery getting weaker and weaker. By the end of the 1st year I could only talk on it for about 20 minutes and it would be dead. After that about 5 minutes of talk time and it would shut off. Worst pictures with the camera on it too. There is no flash. The music sounds ok threw the head phone but if you want to use it for an mp3 player you better keep it plugged into the wall outlet because you won't make it threw one song without the battery running out. I got this phone for free and would rather pay for a phone the get this one again."
3,Minor Problem is Major Headache,Who thought it would be a good idea to prevent people from turning off the hideously annoying start-up and shut-down sounds? Why should I have to download a program and hack into my own phone to turn this totally useless feature off. Shame on Motorola. Shame on AT&T.
4,innovative,"This phone was very well designed and meets the needs of a majority of the user market. However, I was disappointed by the difficulty of synching the calendar with my Outlook. Nevertheless, its the lightest gadget I carry around now and it just looks good!"
3,Low Volume is a killer...,"I've had my RAZR for 2 weeks and the low volume when you are on the phone makes me consider returning it. I've set the volume to the highest setting and I can barely hear it. I've never had problems with hearing on a cell phone. Since this has the ""bluetooth"" technology I tried the ""free"" headset I received. Nice idea but it sits outside your ear making that low volume still hard to hear. It's a pretty phone and it works ok but this lack of volume is a deal breaker for me."
3,"Good, but could be better","Quality of reception = 5 Stars (I have Cingular)Phone key pad = 2 Stars (I feel they need to raise the buttons a millimeter or 2)Ergonomics = 3 stars (it is hard to open with one hand, but it is very thin and for a man this is nice for keeping on the belt)Camera = 5 stars (Has zoom and light and dark settings)Battery life = 4 (this seems to be good so far)I don't know if that averages out to a ""3 star"" or not, but this phone for all the hype should be better. I would have also rather of went with Verizon, I cannot stand the on-screen software (not Motorola's fault), it seems like I have to push 16 buttons just to get anywhere. I have not had verizon, but it has to be better."
2,Cingular is terrible,"The phone looks cool and all but if you're going to use Cingular beware, especially if you're a former AT&T customer which was swallowed by Cingular. Besides the trouble I had migrating my numbers on my family plan (at one point Cingular had me as dead and I had to physically go into a store and prove that I was alive). Now I am attempting to add a 5th phone to my family plan (you are allowed 5 phones on a plan)and they won't let me do it without me putting a $200 deposit for one year. With AT&T I never paid late-I never paid late with Cingular-but they can't explain to me why they arbitrarily now need a deposit. If you can go with another company DO IT. Cingular's customer service is the worst."
1,Razr is very fragile,I want to warn anyone about this phone. We have had three of them and all three broke. We had one repaired in FL. Cost about $100. This phone is a loser. get a V551 instead.
1,"Software Issues, 'White screen of death ! '","Dont buy this crappy phone. Its just been 3 weeks since I started using it, and I get a 'white screen of death' every now & then. And then I have to reboot it to access it.Called T Mobile, and even though its less than 30 days, they'll still charge me 10 bucks for shipping (to replace with a refurbished one). Thats fine but what if the new phone also has the same (or new) issues.The best thing to overcome this problem is not to buy this phone. Samsung is the best cell phone company."
1,Audio Quality Very Very Very poor,I had changed the Motorola Razr V3 phone in one month. Both have the same problem with both of them. The ear piece audioquality is extremely poor and extremely low. It is like a sinusoidal wave and the audio level drops every few seconds and stays low for 10 seconds and then picks up. I am not sure what to do now as I am past the initial 30 days and I do not want this razr phone any more (Two phones in a month exhibiting thesame problem).
3,Don't buy from Amazon,"Amazon only has 30 days warranty on cell phones. If any problem happens after 30 days, you are dead meat. Stay away from Amazon."
2,Don't purchase this for voice or digit dialing,"I origanally purchased this phone thinking it had voice dialing similar to the motorola v710. Unfortunately is uses the old style of voice dial where you have to train your voice for each phonebook entry. The v710 does not require this and utilizes true speech recognition software. Since this was the most important feature to me I am returning the razr and exchanging it for the v710. To bad, the razr is superior in most other categories except the one most importand to me. If it had true nex technology voice recogition I would keep it."
1,Razor software Issue,I have heard numerous problems about this phone mine personally wouldn't let me call out unless i took the battery out and put it back in and my roommates who got the black would just reboot for no reason. This sucks!
5,Best looking phone!,Its a real dream phone!! Afterall its a thinest cell phone any mobile company has ever launched...Its black version also looks cool..but silver one got a unique shine!.Better have the leather carrying case available on amazon! Its a perfect fit!!The only complaint is Motorola doesn't give lot many options as Nokia does..but..Overall I am very happy with the product!
5,The Razr V3 is the Best!!!,"I first bought the V551 by Motorola which is an excellent phone!! But I noticed everbody had the same phone, at least in my area.. I usually like to have something different.. So at first, I did buy the phone because most people didn't have it because of the Price.. The sales person at Cingular which had the V551 told me their was no difference but an Internal antenna and less weight.. I've noticed the Camera is a Hell of alot better, plus the Battery life is by far longer than the other phone...Reguardless of area, the Reception in almost crystal clear even in Roaming or long-distance....I'll admit, I did buy it at first to have something different but I'm Impressed with the features in comparison to the other phones I've owned.. If you have the $$$ buy it!!!Hope this helps!!Mike"
2,Can't synch w/ Outlook,"Happy with the RAZR appearance. Unhappy with the inability to synchronize my contacts in Outlook with the phone. I called Motorola and the only way to do this is to purchase extra software for $30. I can't say I am overjoyed at the thought. Do a Google search on this topic and you will note that even this extra software does not work well. What tricked me was this paragraph above, ""Use the phone's Bluetooth capability to set up a wireless link with a Bluetooth accessory or connect to a computer or hand-held device to exchange and synchronize data. The phone also supports the SyncML PC synchronization standard, can be used with Motorola's Mobile Phone Tools PC application to manage and synchronize contacts, calendar and other data with your PC."""
3,"Yeah, it IS small","So, I haven't bought one of these yet, but I've seen some folks with them and messed around with it. The phone's got a great design and it's really small. Believe me, that part is totally cool.But, other than that, it is a VERY basic phone. That's a big price tag on such a basic phone. Dig?"
2,Good phone if you want to buy another one sooner.,"I've had my phone for over two years now and I'm heading out to buy a new one (something other than a Razor). The Razor has a poor mechanical design. I've dropped three times in the last two years and it's broken it twice. Way too fragile for normal daily use. The software is also pretty week. It regularly needs to be shut down and restarted to that it will transmit multi-media messages. I also didn't particularly care for the functionality of the buttons, but maybe that's just because I liked my Samsung better."
1,Amazon rebate ?,I bought a Razr in Aug/Sep timeframe and then sent a rebate form promptly early in Nov and its been almost 10 weeks and am getting the run around.I do not think Amazon has any reason to fulfil the rebate and am stuck waiting another 8-10 weeks.Do not buy the phone if you are even remotely thinking of redeeming the rebate.
4,Good Phone overall,"I've had this phone for about 6 months now and overall it seems like a good, solid performer. Two things could make this a great phone though. First, the screen is all but impossible to read in anything close to sunlight which makes it dangerous while trying to view in the car. Second, the battery life could be longer. Although it depends on your use, overall it seems to need recharging more often than other phones I've had."
2,Don't buy it,Although this phone is thin and looks nice. I'm disappointed I bought it. It just doesn't work well. I agree with many of the negative reviews of this phone. I had my old cell phone (Nokia) for years and it worked great. I've had this one less than six months and have had nothing but problems.
1,over rated phone,"I purchased this phone about 5 months ago. This phone has a lot of problems, some times it difficult to make phone calls it keeps telling me ""call failed"" I thought that the network is busy but when I put the SIM card in my old Samsung phone there was no problem at all.The other problem is static, people can not hear me clearly because of static, and however I have full service 4 to 5 bars. The software is very slow when you scroll between menus. After I disconnect the phone from the charger the screen start to blink and the resolution goes down.I called Cingular and they replaced with another refurbished phone that have the same problems. Finally they are going to send me a new phone hopefully this will work.I owned so many phones with different brands and the best are Nokia and Samsung."
3,Cingulair users,"Although I don't have the RAZR V3 yet, I got rid of myEriccson Z500a phone. But, the problem is not the phone.It's Cingular. No matter what, they all have the sameproblem. Your phone will cut off in the middle of your conversation. You can hardly hear the other party.As your about to answer the phone, it cuts off with the first ring. And a bunch of other technical problems similar to other Cingular users.My advise is Stay away from Cingular.Sprint is soso technically and has an awful customer service.I used to have T-mobile, the phones never gave me a problembecause their phone service and coverage is great. Anywhere in the world; therefore, I am going back to T-mobile and I'm sure that the RAZR V3 will not have any coverage/tech problems."
4,Anyone have success in porting # after buying from Amazon,I want to buy the RAZR and keep my current number on Sprint. It seems Amazon says the rebates would be invalid. Anyone have experience with this?
3,Read the fine print,"Be very wary of Amazon's new promotion for a the $50 Razor with new Cingular service. If you read the fine print you'll find that porting your number to a Cingular account ""makes you ineligible for the Amazon.com rebates."" Other than that the phone is decent, it looks cool (thin but wide) and is a good deal for $50 if you don't need to port an old number."
4,"Great Phone, great deals available","This is really a nice phone, but is available in the USA for cingular only. However if you have a retailer who can unlock the phone, you can use it with any gsm service.I got an unlocked phone for free after rebate and had wireless BT included for free. Today, there is good deal at buy.com, better than amazon. The same phone for free after rebate and a free Blue tooth handsfree kit.Tapas, NJ, USA"
3,"Nothing extraordinary, mainly a lot of hype around the looks","The phone is ok. I didn't find any difference between RAZR and the Motorolla V300 I had earlier. All the features are the same.Razr has a big huge color screen, bluetooth enabled and can capture videos. But there is no improvement on any of the calling features.So if you are getting the phone free after the rebates you can buy it, else it is not worth the $200."
3,Okay phone,"This phone is overall just a little bit above good/okay. I cant stand the text style and its kind hard to find everything but after a while you get used to it and overall is a pretty good and it has the regular features like alarm, voice recording, camera, video and the speaker phone comes in handy sometimes ^^ it is a popular phone because it is thin but it is kinda big for the hand as it is wide."
1,Piece of Junk!,"When I first placed the (brand new) batteries in and turned in on, I thought it was pretty good; it is easy to use and the measurements are precise. However, when I turned it off and tried to turn it back on again, it wouldn't turn on (unless I remove the batteries and put them back in again). I was too lazy to return it then, so I decided to keep it. Two days later, I tried to use it again, and this time it wouldn't turn on at all! I tried replacing the batteries with a set of new ones and it turned on...the machine ate up my batteries in just two days!! This is when I decided to send it back. It is now on its way back ..."
4,Great Scale,I haven't had any problems with this scale. It's been perfect! The measurements are accurate and the scale is small and can be easily stored. I like the fact that it deducts the weight of your measuring bowl. It's perfect!
1,"It works correctly, but has no metric function?","I purchased this scale from Target, hoping to use it while baking (as weight offers much more precision over volume in breadmaking). Unfortunately, I was surprised to find that while the scale was very precise, the ""mode"" function simply switched between displaying pounds or ounces. This ends up to be pretty useless though, and the scale is missing one key function...This is the only digital scale I've ever seen that fails to offer a standard/metric converstion mode. Huh? I didn't even know they MADE digital scales without that option. Even a standard budget spring loaded scale offers a dual units of measurment. I'll definitely be returning this."
1,Piece o horse manure.,"I used it for a couple of months and then one day it just stopped working. Yes, I changed the batteries. This is a piece of incredibly shoddy workmanship. Save your money."
1,Do NOT buy this,I got it mailed to me opened it and put batterys in it and pushed the ON button and it died right there it blinked froze i pushed off and then couldent turn it back on
1,It just quit working,"At first this scale seemed great - although no grams just ounces and pounds. But then after I had had it only 6 weeks, it just stopped working. It worked at breakfast and didn't at lunch. We tried new batteries and everything. We obviously went to the box it came in and found that there was no information in the paperwork that came with the scale of whom to call or write too in order to resolve the problem.Poor customer service on the part of the manufacturer of the scale. Worst $30 I ever spent."
2,Bad news.,"While this tape may be a good introduction to Pilates, it is VERY boring to use several times a week. The sound is terrible. Sometimes I can't even understand what Moira Stott is saying. The video is terrible. Most of the time the focus on the upper half of the person's body or just the abs and you can't see what the rest of their body is doing to learn how to do it properly yourself. It's also too expensive for a tape you can only do half of without spending $60 for a fitness circle on the Stott pilates website."
1,DON'T BUY IT IF YOU WANT ENTHUSIAM OR MOTIVATION,"THESE VIDEOS ARE OVER PRICED, POORLY DIRECTED AND PRODUCED. POOR SOUND QUALITY, POOR ANGLE OF VIEWING THE EXERCISES AND THE INSTRUCTOR IS DULL AND LETHARGIC. IT EXPLAINS THE MOVES BUT THEY ARE DIFFICULT TO VISUALIZE. I PURCHASED 2, THE ESSENTIALS MAT AND THE INTERMIDIATE MAT AND FEEL VERY DISSATISFIED TO SAY THE LEAST."
4,Don't be turned off!,"Yes, this tape is not exciting. But when you master the moves, you can go on to the next tape, Intermediate Matwork, in which the sound quality, pace, and instructions are better. I am now doing the Intermediate and love it, but could never have done it without the Beginning tape!"
4,Exactly like the class,"I take a fabulous Pilates class 2x per week by a Stott certified trainer who sold me this tape. Although the sound is not great and the pace seems slow the exercises and direction are identical to my very expensive class. I love this tape since it helps me remember the names of the exercises, encourages proper form and shows various ways to increase the difficulty of each move. The first few times I did the tape I did not have a fitness circle and it did not make any difference. Other Pilates books have you use a firm pillow between your legs for the exact same exercises."
3,GREAT EXERCISES - POORLY DEMONSTRATED,"Moves should have been demonstrated without the instructor right on top of the demonstrator. I would have like to have seen a better views of the exercises. I got more enthusiam and better explainations in the book, ""The Pilates Body"", by Brook Siler.There is no notation made that Moira Stott has received her certification in the Pilates method and seems to have developed her own format. A low-buck money making series of videos."
2,Tedious Abdominals...This is for you.,"I expected more out of this video. Yes, it is focused on ""core conditioning"" and abdominals, which is what I was looking for, but the video is, quite simply, boring. Stott expertly goes over every move, but she shows no enthusiasm in what she is explaining. Her delivery makes the exercises seem like a chore. However, if you are looking for a looooong abs only workout, this video is for you. Just follow Stott's technique and you'll work your abs...hard. You'll just be bored."
2,RUPAUL - An old dog with no new tricks,"I have listened to this more times than I should, it is just the same old story and is dull, dull, dull. Why is it that Drag Queens (and Madonna come to think of it)think they can repackage what little talent they have and think that people will buy it. If you are a die-hard fan buy it, if I were you I would save my money and buy something less boring instead"
5,Very detailed and esay to understand,This book is excellent! It tells you about everything from buying to taking care of your canary. It also explains if your birdie could be caged with other birds. Has lots of pictures and at the end of the book it has space to record information about your bird.
1,unbelievably shoddy,"The worst edited code samples I've ever seen. It looks like they printed out listings, OCR'd them, and published the result without even a cursory glance. I'm taking my copy back."
1,The worst technical book I've ever seen,"Professional Hibernate is by far the worst technical book I've ever seen. There are glaring typos and grammatical errors on every page. Further, the code samples are extremely basic. The authors made no effort to teach the readers how to develop real applications. And the code would never even work! Very few examples would actually compile because there are glaring basic errors that any entry level programmer should know.Don't waste your money on this book!"
2,Absolutely Disappointing,"This book has some of the good qualities of a typical Wrox title: code centered, clear layout, step-by-step practical approach, but has clearly been published without even the shadow of a technical review. My guss is the book was rushed and not really invested into because ""the hibernate book"" (by Gavin King) was looming on the horizon. The publisher would have shown much more business sense if it had taken time for a really solid book on Hibernate 3. The amount of typos and inaccuracies both in the text and in the code is staggering. Several interesting subjects are mentioned, like AspectJ and Design Patterns, but in a too superficial way to be of any real help. Gradecki, I hope you have not really co-authored this but just supplied the AspectJ chapter..."
1,How can Wiley publish a book like this???,"This book deserves 0 stars, if there is such a thing.First of all, the coverage on Hibernate is very shallow and lightyears away from Manning's HIA. You get more advanced info by reading the Hibernate User's Guide. The sample code is trivial at best. Pages after pages are wasted on useless POJO code.Second, I can find at least 1 typo in every 5 pages. If I look harder, I am sure I can find more.Most importantly, I doubt the authors know Java that well, let alone Hibernate. Read this from page 125 -126 on binding Session to ThreadLocal:""Notice that the session attribute is declared as a ThreadLocal variable: This means the JVM will ensure that only one session object is available for all the threads that call the openSession() method.""Are you kidding me?I have wasted my $20 on this book. Hopefully you don't have to."
4,"Very in-depth, but terse and code heavy",This is a well written and illustrated book that guides you through the entire Hibernate O/R mapping landscape. The chapters are short. The text is fairly terse. And the author relies heavily on code to do the talking. It's fine if you like learning that way. For those who want a gentler approach I would recommend Manning's Hibernate in Action.
1,Laughably bad,"Full of typos (they could at least have done a search-and-replace of ""Hibemate""). Lots of filler (viz. the chapters on things like the DAO pattern).Definitely not worth it.The Manning book remains the standard for in-depth coverage, while the O'Reilly programmer's notebook does the trick for the quick-and-dirty introduction. Skip the rest."
4,An excellent companion volume to other rod building books.,"Well known split cane rod builder Ray Gould, has produced a comprehensive book encompassing several related bamboo fly rod sub topics. Ray walks the reader through the different commercial producers of bamboo fly rods, and tells you what to look for when placing a value on an older rod. Repairs to that old rod in the basement are dicussed. Diagrams and information to produce your own special rod making tools are here, as well as making your own rods from scratch. This is an excellent book for any serious rod builder, collector, restorer, or anyone who appreciates a fine hand made bamboo fly rod. I recommend this book as a companion to other rod buiding books. Ed Dickson"
4,Helpful,"I was rebuilding my Granddads cane fly rod. It was the first cane rod that I had rebuilt and ""Cane Rods"" was one of my resource books."
4,A wealth of information.,"This is a must for the library of a first time rod builder. The extra information it gives makes it a must. Wait to you buy for first couple of books but remember to buy it during the second round. It has little ""snippets"" of information that helps bring everything together for the first time builder."
2,Cannot hear the words,"Another reviewer warned me and I should have listened. It's just background music, at least in my car. Maybe with headphones one could hear the beautiful words of these hymns."
2,Very Disapointed,"I bought this cooler becuase it was advertised to keep ice longer than most coolers. It does not. I also thought it would be a rugged cooler that would provide years of service, but after only four years the cooler is falling apart.The hinges are tearing off the back and the lock on the front does not work well. I use the cooler about 10 times per year on weekend trips. I know if the cooler was used more often it would be completely broken by now because I have used it so little.The cooler is also much heavier than other coolers, if it kept ice longer I would not mind that.Save your money and just buy a regular cooler unless you just want the retro look."
1,Stainless Steel Cooler,I bought one of these coolers to go to 3 days of Races at Ky Speedway (June 28th thru June 30th) The weather was very hot with tempertures in the low 100's every day and I had to keep putting 2-7lb bags of ice in it every day Which I did not mind but after the First day of use I noticed water under my truck and the drain was leaking around the hole in the cooler and the drain itself I din't have any trouble returning it but I was disappointed in the lack of quality in such an expensive cooler!!
5,Great product worth the money,this item is just as described and delivered fast and on time high quality and great looks if you need a well made cooler you have come to the right place.
3,Keeps food cold but heavy even before filling,"The cooler looks good and does its job in terms of keeping food/drinks cold for days. On our recent trip, it kept our food cold for 3 days before we had to replace the ice. However one major drawback for me is that the cooler is really heavy. When it's empty it's heavy so imagine the weight once its loaded. It requires at least 2 people (and with drinks it required 3 of us to carry it). If it was lighter and had wheels I'd probably give it 5 stars."
4,Solid cooler for a solid price,I purchased this cooler about 8 months ago and I am happy with the purchase. I have used it on many camping trips and it was easy to carry and kept all my delicious food cold. My only problem is that the old Coleman coolers were made of a nice metal. It made it feel really solid. This has a simple metal cover over the plastic. This takes away from the rustic feel.
5,"High quality work horse; good for car camping, parks.","This is a great cooler. It holds a ton, is strong and takes banging around. It is good for dragging stuff for a family outing to the park, or for car camping. Not a back-packable cooler, mind you, but this is the heirloom cooler you will want for decades. We use ours as a mini-fridge in a lake cabin, and it keeps stuff cold with occasional changes of ice or cooler blocks."
4,My Red Cooler,"I just love the new steal Coleman cooler. I use my all the time. I love the red cooler, reminds me of the old days."
3,"Looks great, but that's about it!","I bought this cooler because of all the great reviews. I was so excited when I got it. I thought it looks great, that's why I gave it a 3 star rating or else it would have been 1 star. I tested it that night I got home. I put bottled water and soda and dumped ice on top. That was around 8PM. By 11PM (3 hours later!), I opened the cooler and ice was halfway melted. There was still ice left. Closed the lid back and left it there and checked on it again the following night when I got home. No more ice, just water! I can't believe other reviewers said that it could keep ice for 3 to 4 days! Mine was just 24 hours inside a 78 degree temp home. Did I just get a bad unit?"
1,cooler,"i returned, not made with the same durability as in the past. the cooler does not suction shut, their is play even when the latch is locked. i sent it back"
1,do not buy,"I purchased two without doing my homework, boy, do I regret it. Yes, it is very cool looking, but very poorly constructed. The latch broke off, is unfixable and drain is easily pulled out causing water to leak at inconvenient time. Truly, this cooler was used twice, once for a day boat trip and an overnight camping trip, that's it. I was going to give second one as wedding gift, but don't feel right given experience with mine. Contacting Coleman is not worth your time. I am stuck. No recourse. Bought from vendor on Amazon, they wont return, because it has been two weeks past a year. DO NOT BUY."
5,Coleman Cooler,"After having a number of plastic coolers, I opted for the classic Coleman Steel cooler. Although heavier than plastic, it is more sturdy and appears to keep the contents cooler much longer. Would recommend to anyone."
3,"so,so",In no way does this cooler come close to matching the orignal steel cooler. It did keep ice very well but the durability is poor. The paint scratches off way to easy and the thin skin dents with ease. When loaded the handels felt like they were going fold up and the stops that hold them out stright were not lined up with the handle itself.
1,"Poor design, poor insulation.","When Coleman designed this cooler, they left off a way to stop the lid from opening past 90-ish degrees. This results in the lid opening about 180 degrees, which stresses the hinges, and breaks the outer stainless layer away from the inner insulation. I have been through two lids, and now the body of the cooler is breaking away the same way. Yes, it does have a 100 year warranty, but I bought expecting the same build quality as my grandfather's that is 60 years old. There is just no comparison.Coleman also says it will keep ice for 3 days at 100 degrees. This couldn't be further from the truth. It will not hold ice for 24 hours at 85 degrees.Bottom line: Buy a good Igloo marine cooler, and use the extra $70 to fill it with your beverage of choice."
5,Great gift idea!,"This cooler works well, tho maybe not as well as some of the more modern Colemans. Very capable tho, looks cool and has some heritage behind it. Makes you want to head out into the woods or the beach with your cooler and '62 Power Wagon."
2,Misleading product pictured,"I ordered the item pictured, but it showed a can twice the size of the cans they shipped. It clearly shows a picture of a can with 374 grams on my order, but Pet Food Direct told me that wasn't their problem. They shipped 1 case of 24 small cans of 156 grams. This is very misleading and only causes customer complaints. Pet Food Direct really did not wish to help me and kept me on hold for 10 minutes waiting for a supervisor who basically told me it wasn't her problem."
4,Good background info but could have used more game info,"This is a very fun book to read. The whole book is written as a special issue of 'Paradigma', the Etherites' journal of progressive sciences. Most of the book is about the history and practices of the Sons of Ether. In this regard, the book succeeds greatly. The Etherites appear to be a mix of Victorian scientists mixed in with sci-fi pulp heroes from the earlier parts of the 20th century. A few noteworthy Etherites are displayed at the end of the book, including the narrator from 'Book of the Worlds'. When it comes to useable game mechanics, there really wasn't enough. Only a handful of rotes and devices were discussed."
4,...,"I love this camera, for the price.. had it for a couple months now, and overall it's great for a compact digital camera... only negative is that I still manage to get blurred images sometimes, unless I'm completely not moving or using a tripod. Otherwise, it takes very clear, lush and detailed pictures with true to life colors, and doesn't seem to burn through batteries as easily as other cameras I've had in years past, and has a lot of nice features. The Red Eye redux and direct to TV/computer works wonderfully... it's pretty fast in recovery time... and it does an excellent job in self adjusting to the light situation, no matter what it may be."
1,Fragile,"The camera takes absolutly fantastic pictures. Unfortunately it is very fragile. We had the camera fall about 1' and hit the floor. After whicht it was no longer functional (reports ""Lens Error""). The Nikon repair shop wants $150 to repair it. A bit steep for a $175 camera.We now own a Stylus 790 SW from Olympus. The image quality isn't quite as good, but the camera is supposed to be able to survive a 5' drop."
5,best compilation I've ever purchased,"Never before have I bought a cd, ""blind"", and been so all-out psyched with it! There is NOT a dud on here, and I'm a picky listener. I've got a whole bunch of new bands to seek out. Particular stand-outs are Guided By Voices, Helium, Cat Power, Railroad Jerk, Pizzacato Five... VERY guitar-driven, though, so, if that's not your bag, look elsewhere... What a bargain! Snap it up!"
3,"Collection Of Bread, Solo And New Recordings From David Gates.","When Bread were at the top of their game, in the early 1970s, no one in the pop/rock arena could better them, well maybe The Carpenters.There are 5 new songs here, the first three are rather average and predictable.However The Mustang and Mirror, Mirror are both high standard ballards which really standout.(It helps that the lyrics are printed in the booklet).The 5 solo recordings don't really impact on me except the excellent Goodbye Girl.That leaves 10 Bread songs, including Make It With You, Baby I'm-A Want You, Everything I Own and the 100% essential and brillant The Guitar Man.If you want a cross section of David Gates and Bread, this is it.If you want 20 sure fire songs from Bread, get The Sound Of Bread."
4,The new songs are the attraction here,"It's been a while since we've had new songs from David Gates. There are four new songs on this album, and a newly recorded (and inferior I think) version of ""Love is Always Seventeen"". The new songs are okay, but don't come close to the classic songs.Probably too much of the rest is made up of the Bread classics that any Bread and David Gates fan will already own. And for a ""definitive"" collection, it's a major surprise that there's not a single track from the ""Falling in Love Again"" album, a much better album than ""Take Me Now"", from which there is a solitary track.So it's an album of great music, undeniably (new songs excepted if we're being honest) but an album that seems to me to be out of balance.If you really want to hear those new songs, I guess you'll be buying it, but considering the price, you may be better off buying a couple of other Bread/Gates CDs, and you'll get most of what's on here."
5,The test of time,"There is music that is timeless and that will be touching hearts forever. David Gates' music is just that! Having been a Bread fan since the first time I heard ""Make it with you"" in 1969-70, I felt there has never been enough music recorded by Bread, David Gates and James Griffin.After recently seeing David perform in Utah I wanted more. After hearing ""Find Me"" I wanted a copy of my own. This song is without a doubt one of the most moving songs that I have ever heard in my life. I found this album on Ebay and purchased it from a European seller. It was worth every penny of the $30 that I paid.Having not gotten my fill, I traveled a few months later to Arizona to hear David perform again. Again, I was not disappointed! The crowd in Phoenix responded with silent awe and tears to ""Find Me"" as well as singing along with every word of every song--especially ""Everything I Own"". It was another great night with one of our generations greatest singer-songwriters."
3,Good Compilation Diminished by a Criminal Oversight,"There's a few pages missing from this 'songbook'; while a good overview of David Gates' work in both Bread and on his own, any compilation with his name prominently displayed that does NOT include the impossibly seductive, absolutely unforgettable ""Took The Last Train (To St. Tropez)"" cannot lay claim to being complete - period, atypical or not. That breezy, midtempo song with a tear in its eye (a modest hit in 1978 following up ""The Goodbye Girl"", from the album of the same name) features one of THE most affecting sax hooks ever written....."
1,Terrible. This book is an exact reprint of Witch Doctor.,"If you already own Witch Doctor on Wall Street, don't waste your time with this new one. It is an exact copy of ""The Witch Doctor On Wall Street"". Not a refrasing, mind you, but an exact duplicate. What a fraud. The only thing different are some updated graphs; a few extra footnotes; a short prologue, which is just a summary of the chapters; and the Epilogue. This constitutes about 20 pages of new material. Prometheus Books and Dr. Parks should be ashamed to call this a new book."
2,Second edition of an entertaining and informative book,"This book appeared first in 1996 under the title ""Witch Doctor of Wall Street"" and it turns out to be exactly the same book with an ""epilogue"" added yet neither the book nor the advertising suggest this. The book forms the basis of Professor Parks' course in Capital Markets and Investment at Pace University. The tone of the book is critical and curmudgeonly yet some interesting points are made and it makes a useful accompaniment to the standard finance text book (Sharpe, Brealy & Meyers, etc.). The first edition was full of misprints and errors which, I hope, have been corrected in this second edition."
1,Costs too much to ship,"I ordered two of these cookie sheets.They shipped them seperately!! Charging me 6 dollars each cookie sheet. Costing me 20 dollars when all was said and done for only one cookie sheet. Both cookie sheets ended up costing me FOURTY DOLLARS!!!!!!!!!! SO DON""T BUY THEM HERE!!!You can get them At Walmart for only nine dollars!!!What a RIP OFF!!!"
5,Not Really History,"I do not mean to imply by the title of this review that Ajami's book is ""false"" or polemical. Rather, I intend to warn readers that _The Dream Palace of the Arabs_ it is not a work of chronological accounting and crisp historical analysis.Instead, it is impressionistic and non-linear. Events are narrated as episodes in the life or from the perspective of a certain poet or political figure. This gives the book a dreamy, subjective quality. This, surely, is the point: not to answer a specific historical question, but to tell the tale of ""a generation's odyssey"", as the book's subtitle has it.The result is effective and haunting in its sense of disillusionment and frustration, and I recommend the book highly.The one caveat I offer is that the reader will get much more out of this book if s/he has already read at least some Middle Eastern history, and preferably a fair amount."
4,"flowery, ornate, but not too deep","I am in two minds abou this book. On the one hand, it is beautifully written and it taught me a great deal, but I do not think it does the subject justice. Too much of it reads like a hagiography of the poets he admires, and there is too little analysis of Arab intellectualism, the purported topic of the book. I would have preferred more focus on the intellectual trends (a la Hughes ""Consciousness and Society: The reorientation of European Social Thought 1890-1930), as opposed to the fixation on certain figures. On the whole, I'd buy it again but I am longing for more."
3,It was OK,"A lot of the subject matter is poets and intellectuals inthe Arab countries and the extent to which they reflect the attitudes on a number of related subjects - secular vs religion, Israel vs Arab, democracy vs repression, modernity vs tradition. Interesting at times, maybe a little too focused on the literary at other times. Sometimes the reader has to work a bit to get something out of it. I'm not sure how much insight it gives in the end on the current popular mood in Arabcountries - depends on to what extent the intellectuals reflect that mood, I guess."
1,1 star is too much for this author,"Basically, if you are interested in learning about the Arab World, then do not read what Fouad Ajami has to say. He is an expert at misrepresenting the truth. Read books by Edward Said or Robert Fisk instead."
1,What else is new?,"As always, Fouad Ajami is doing an amazing job to rewrite the history using his ""Ajamian"" style. A Generation's Odyssey is a true waste of time. I really wish that I read An Apartment Called Freedom instead."
4,Good and Noisey,I give many of the tracks a 3 for originality because many of them sound like tracks DJ Tron was spinning in '98. But I give it a five for speed and evil. Ballanceing out to a 4 star rateing. Tracks 19-21 on CD 2 are extream tracks that kick ass for lack of a less cheesey term. LOLTrue Noise and Speedcore fans will love it.
3,From Back Cover,"THE RIGHT BEDThe first time Blaine Saunders spies the antique brass bed, she has to have it. Practical in every other way, she's suddenly discovered a weakness for sensuous beds where dreams come true.THE WRONG ADDRESSBut the chances of her beautiful bed being delivered to the wrong address twice are about the same as lightning striking twice. Who knew that could happen? Tracking down the elusive bed is exhausting. So when she finally finds it in a stranger's apartment, she's sure no one will notice if she has a quick nap...THE RIGHT MAN!Where is his bed? When Donovan Roy arrives home late one night, the last thing he expects to find is a different bed... complete with a sleeping beauty! And in a white-hot flash of shared passion, he knows he'll do anything to keep her... and the bed."
3,Good but not great,"Having seen all the marginal to very bad US films about this race (Gumball, Gumball Rally, Cannonball, and Cannonball Run I & II) it's great to see the actual race documented. By the way the only decent ""Hollywoodization"" of this race is the original Gumball. I still prefer 3000 Miles to this film but it's a nice companion piece. By the way the actual Gumball 3000 race in August 2008 will start in San Francisco and got to LA, San Diego, Vegas, and eventually North Korea and China for the Olympics."
4,Night fishing,A tackle box with a night light. What a great ideal! The light allows one to see what you are doing without fumbling with a a flashlight. The box itself is well organized to store your tackle for any type of fishing.
4,A nice surprise,"I was fortunate enough to hear this band live at Berbati's Pan in Portland Oregon and was very impressed with their sound. Yes they obviously have been influenced by Radiohead but they have their own unique sound and were very tight live. I would definately recommend picking it up despite the previous bitter reviewer who either failed to listen to it or gave it a cursory listen. Climber is great and btw Portland is a great city as well, especially if you like craft Beer!!"
1,An Expensive Glass Coaster,"If you love Radiohead or Postal Service, why would you want to pick up something by a poseur band that is trying to sound like those two bands instead of picking up the original works? Oh...that's unless you're in the band or caught them by accident at the rock club.Oh well, Portland, SNOREgon blows."
4,"Not bad, not great","I bought this video after I had worked out on the bellytwins tapes for a while, which helped since I was already familiar with the moves. This video is well divided into working various parts of the body: arms, abs, hips, and so on, but the camera focuses mostly on Dolphina's face or abs. It's hard to do the steps she shows when the camera is panned on her abs. But if you already know the steps it's not too bad. The tape offers a relaxing 50 minutes, and if someone wanted a more intense workout they could just rewind each segment and do it again. The costumes and settings are great, and she is encouraging, but when the sequel comes out, I hope they do a full-body shot of her demonstrating the moves. It's not a tape for beginners, but just something to add to the collection to add variety to the workouts."
4,Pretty good once you get past the New Age stuff,"I got exactly what I was looking for in this tape. I wanted a workout that was a little different than all the aerobics tapes, that would leave me feeling sexy and pleasantly tired from a good workout. I agree with other reviewers that the camera is on Dolphina's face when it should be showing you how to move your body part properly, and she does get bogged down in the New Age stuff. She looks like she's straight off a California beach and not descended from gypsies, but I can suspend my disbelief and just enjoy the tape as an alternative to the ""hamstring-curls, 2,3,4"" videos"
5,Motivating & Inspirational,"I also disagree with most of the reviews written here...I think this DVD is an awesome workout, easy to follow even for a first-timer and very well broken down. My sister is a semi-pro Bellydancer in CT and got these for me because there are no live classes in South Carolina (yet).After doing this tape, my muscles are tired (and I have been lifting and working out for 12 years), I am sweating a little (which is alot for me) and I feel wonderful, sexy and powerful - full of self-esteem, feeling just like the goddess that Dolphina says I'll feel like in the video!I love it, and reccomend the Godess Workout to anyone who wants to feel that way, and wants a well produced, interst-holding, motivating video to accomplish it. i will try the rest of Dolphina's DVDs based on this one alone.-KristiCharleston, SC"
5,My new daily routine,"I love this video! I do it everyday now, as I love the way makes me feel while I'm doing it and how I feel afterwards. I actually look forward to my workout time now, because it feels special. I'm not great at it, but I'm having fun learning it. I feel more flexible and toned, especially all the new muscles I'm using that I don't get from any other workout!"
1,Not a good workout for people who want to learn,"I own the video and my first impression was ""What's This?"" It seems more like a home video targeted towards men instead of a serious belly dancing video workout. I definately do not recommend this to anyone who would like to use it for anything other than simple viewing."
3,Good entertainment,"I loved the set and the beautiful costumes ,however the instruction and demonstration leave a little to be desired. On the whole it is not really a bad video. It is beautifully lite and well photographed but I've seen better belly dancers at the Ren fairs.The camera man seems fascinated with Dolphinas face when he should have focused on her hips or foot work. As for instruction it is lacking the verbal element necessary for a novice to break down the movements. I have some experience at bellydancing and wasn't tooooo in lost . However, a friend who had never bellydanced was completly in the dark. For a true instruction tape get Neenea and Veenas set.It is super,esp. basic moves!"
4,Great Workout!,I have this video and use it everyday. I have read the other reviews and disagree. Dolphina is a beautiful woman and if she wasn't why would you take instruction from her. Her looks are motivational to me. I am not intimidated by her great body just motivated and hopeful. This video's movements get easier the more you use it. Believe me you do get a good workout from this tape. I do this video before I do a second one called Body Flex. I am energized and envigorated after doing the Goddess Workout and able to continue on to the next tape. Try it for yourself don't let the nay sayers keep you from trying it. My only complaint is that the camera does need to focus more on the area of the body that Dolphina is moving at all times not just the few times that she demonstrates the movement the first time. However the more you do this tape the movements come like second nature to you.
2,It was too good to be true!,"If you think getting great abs with this workout sounds too good to be true, you are right! This is only entertainment! I think that belly-dancing can be hlepful with an real-life instructor but you aren't going to get those abs with thsi video -- by the time this babe has shown us all of the moves, the routine is about 5 minutes and did nothing for me! It's back to sit-ups..."
2,Am i missing something here?,"Because i don't get the appeal of this video at all. What killed me was the amount of time spent of Dolpina's face, so much so that i begin to wonder if the camera man had a thing for Dolphina. Sometimes it's so bad you can't tell what you are supposed to do at all.Think Phoebe from Friends but with no sense of humor and way to much new age lingo. I tried to do this tape a second time but couldn't make it through, i found her to be so cloying.If you want a great bellydance tape with a fabulous sense of humour try 'The Sensuos Workout with Shamira"" I have heard nothing but great things regarding her technical expertise and how can you go wrong with a women who can do a little belly dance demo with a cardboard cuttout of Captain Picard?"
3,I liked it but...,"I am an absolute beginner and while this video made me feel sensual and relaxed, it did not make me sweat or explain enough of the movements. I would rather see what her entire body is doing as opposed to just seeing her face. The set, music, and costumes are beautiful, but the final dance could be longer. She moves her arms the whole time, but only explains the arm movements in one segment. Though minimal, I DID like the chakra and Goddess talk. Overall, I liked it, but I will keep looking for another video."
3,Didn't live up to expectations!,"I was very excited about getting this video, but I have to say I was disappointed. Dolphina looks and acts like she should be in adult videos, not fitness videos. The camera angles were very unhelpful, they kept zooming in on Dolphina's great abs and chest, but never her legs and feet so you could see how she was doing the moves! Her costumes were beautiful as was the set, but never did she try to explain the fundamentals of the moves, she would just start shaking it and expect you to keep up!All in all I'd say it's the kind of video your boyfriend or husband talk you into buying so that they can watch it when you finally realize how worthless it is!"
3,Not for learning correct technic or footwork,"I used these videos to workout with bellydance ,I shows some great moves and how to do them , however it dosent show much technic , and never shows footwork.For the absolute beginner I would recommend The Sensual Art of Bellydance, because it shows correct posture , footwork ,and technic.With Dolphina the carmera is constantly zooming to her face, and you can hardly see what she is doing with her legs and feet even when the camera shows her full body view ,because of all her vails, skirts and garb.However if you have alittle experience with bellydance then it is a nice tape to practice isolations with."
1,Frustrating!,"Like another reviewer I found the video frustrating. In order to do the moves demonstrated I needed to see foot/leg/knee positions but, instead, was shown torsos and faces. Quite simply I couldn't reproduce the moves that were demonstrated."
5,The Goddess Workout with Dolphina,"I have several videos and cds on bellydance. None of them compare to The Goddess Workout. I think the background scenery is fabulous, Dolphina's costumes are beautiful, and you get a spiritual lift as well as a terrific aerobic workout. If I had found this video first, I wouldn't have wasted my money on all those others."
2,NOT an Intro!,"If only I had read the reviews before buying this! I have been using Veena and Neena's bellydance workouts for quite some time, and when I found a set of three DVDs from Dolphina's Goddess Workout, I thought it'd be nice to try something different. Boy, was I wrong! I'm somewhere between beginner and intermediate, and I still had a lot of trouble keeping up with the ""Intro"". I was particularly frustrated when, several times, Dolphina started ""teaching"" a hip/leg/foot motion, and for most of the time she was doing it, she was only visible from the hips up! Maybe someone on Ebay will want this set."
3,"Fun and sexy, but NOT instructional!","If you want an instructional belly dancing tape: This is NOT for you. Keep looking and read reviews for other tapes.If you want a fun, sexy, feel-good workout that will keep you coming back for more: This IS for you!!Although the tape focused mostly on her face, it was loads of fun! I think the most important part about working out to this tape is to not take yourself so darn seriously. Just have fun, do the best you can, and pretend you're a goddess!"
2,where's the technique?,"I can't recommend this video. Belly dance is all about muscle isolation, and in order to get a good workout, you really need to have at least the technique basics. Not only is this not explained, but the camera shots are often so tight you can't even *see* the muscles that are supposed to be working. It's too complicated for beginners and not a very good workout for the more advanced dancers who will be able to control the needed muscle groups. But hey, what great costumes!"
2,Discouring start for a Bellydance beginner,"Not worth your money. This is the first tape I purchased and I plan on selling on Ebay, if anyone will actually buy it. This is not a tape for beginners. When learning a move they will concentrate on a close up of her face and you can't learn the moves. I kept yelling ""Zoom Out"" please! I was completely discouraged after 15 minutes. I think I will try Veena and Nina (or whatever) instead!!"
3,"Fun Bellydancing Workout, BUT...","...it has some problems. The video editing of the workout is horrible. Instead of showing the movement clearly, you'll be looking at her face or upper body instead of her feet, for instance. It's frustrating for a beginner to try to figure out what how to do a few of the moves.Having said that, the video is a lot of fun and I have enjoyed using it. But be careful with the neck rolls. They are pretty intense and the first time I used it my neck was terribly sore the next day."
5,Great,"I don't know what the person who said it looks like it was made by playboy was talking about. She wears MORE clothing than the Neena and Veena videos (which are GREAT too) and she never says anything sexual. This is a great video, but i do agree about the camera stuff, however within one viewing or so youll be clear enough on what to do so it doesn't matter."
2,Well...,If the video focused on what she was doing and not on her face and costumes...I'd probably learn something :)Now to find a video that will enable me to *learn* bellydancing...
4,"Fun, Sexy Workout","This is a really fun workout. Granted, you don't work up a big sweat or anything, but the moves work muscles you don't usually work in a regular aerobics workout. But it's a good introduction to bellydancing. I had never bellydanced before, and by my second try at this tape, I was really getting the hang of it! I did have to mark it down a star because Dolphina is just so cheesy! I think she must have been a porn star in another life. At one point during the cool down, she gives out this big moaning sigh...jeesh! And the production value is the same... This is alot of fun though, and I can't say that for many of the workout tapes I own. One hint--I find it much more fun with a fringy scarf tied around my hips!"
3,fluffy,"I was more amused by this tape than anything. Dolphina can dance, alright, but her style makes me think of what would result if Playboy Bunnies decided to make a belly dance video: repeated costume and hairdo changes, low lighting, numerous, up-close bosom shots and ditzy comments in a babyish, breathy voice. I prefer Neena and Veena's tapes--they are classy, well produced and a good workout."
3,Really 3.5 Stars,"In a nutshell, I think most of the reviewers have valid points. The highs of the video are the settings, costumes, music, Delphina's personality-which I thought was sincere and humorous and sexy. The lows were it would have been nice if the camera shot her body movements in sync with her instructions as that didn't happen during all the routines. I have taken belly dance classes and her movements are basic belly dance moves, which is great for an introduction to belly dance. The workout will make you sweat and that is a good thing, so give it a chance and be open to the experience."
1,T_E_R_R_I_B_L_E,"This is horrendous! If I wanted to see Dolphina, I would have bought a performance tape. The camera mostly just shows her face instead of the dance movements she's supposedly teaching you. As she goes through a fairly complicated combination of shimmies, circles, lifts and drops, THE CAMERA IS ENTIRELY ON HER FACE. This is useless for instruction. During the shimmy segment, she wears a long skirt that covers her legs. While that's fine for performance to preserve the mystery of how the dancer is moving like that, for an instructional tape, the viewer wants to see that the movement comes from the knees. I am so sorry I bought this, I wish I could return something just for being horrible."
2,Dolphina is NOT Neena and Veena,"As per other reviewers, the DVD focuses too much on her face/head/upper torso so that you worry about leg and arm/hand position. None of the foot or hand movements are explained. She is soothing and it is nice that she narrates herself. I did not break a sweat. It was not dancing or working out. More like yoga. The routine at the end was impossible. She did not go through the movements she would use or choreography and all you see is the middle of her body and head while you guess what she is doing and what her arms and legs are doing off-camera. I sort of dread the other three tapes in the set."
5,Great Isolations,I have worked out with this tape about 20 times and I still find it challenging. I think the body isolation exercises require a lot of concentration and control. There are quite a few excercises on the tape and they are all really good! I always feel great after the workout and I think the techniques have improved my body awareness and dancing overall.
3,"As A Beginner, I Would Rate It As ""Okay""...","It is... OKAY. I say this because I often find myself lost during the video. I have done this workout with my sister, and we both agreed that we needed the camera to focus on her BODY, not her face. We were often left wondering, ""What should we do with our feet??"" The music is wonderful, and the costumes are brilliant. Dolphina is beautiful, and it's understandable that the camera focuses on her face. However, her beauty doesn't help my dancing... I have begun to learn bellydancing from this tape, and I would say that I am progressing, but I think that perhaps I could have started with a better intro-video that was more thorough and explanatory."
2,Not for the beginner,"This was my first attempt at learning how to bellydance. This tape concentrates more on Dolphina than teaching. The moves aren't broken down, and the camera focuses on the mid section about 90% of the time. You can't really tell how you should move your feet or bend/unbend your knees. This tape is not for beginners, it's for more experienced dancers."
3,Not an instructional video,"This tape can be a good workout tape if you have some familiarity with bellydancing. There isn't a lot of technique instruction given; and the lack of full body shots doesn't allow you to see what she's actually doing. The routine at the end which supposedly puts all the moves together is off-balanced, and isn't as graceful as you would expect from a bellydancer. If you're looking for instruction, look for another tape."
1,not worth the money,The video spends to much time on her face and not enough on her total body showing you how to do the moves. Her legs are covered making it difficult to mimic her movements. I would not recommed this tape to anyone. If you want a good bellydance workout tape by another one this one is for men wanting to watch a playboy bunny!
3,A little dissapointing,"Just bought this tape and read all the reviews here and thought I'd try it out. A little dissapointed because as a beginner it is near impossible to see her lower body where all the movement is. For the duration of the tape the focus is the upper body and unfortunatly that isn't where the movement is. Great costumes though. Very hard to follow and unless you just really like to look at Dolphina face(she's pretty, but not the reason I bought the tape). I wouldn't recommend. Shamiras is much better."
1,Boring,This tape was extremely basic and it doesn't keep your interest. I was very disappointed after viewing the tape. Don't waist your time on this one.
2,Not an exercise tape,"As a busy person who loves yoga, I use a lot of videos for my practice. I got this tape for my sister for christmas and thought I'd try it out.The camera is on Dolphina's face at the most crucial times during the workout, her advancement is too fast for beginners, and her clothes, though beautiful, entirely wrong for an exercise video.... she should have paid for consultation with an exercise specialist before making the video. And while at that, maybe should have invested in a Rumi book to learn that Sufism is not a religion, but a way of life and that Rumi was not from Turkey but Persia!... a waste of money."
1,Can't See Below Waist So How Does One Learn?,"The camera angles on this video are really horrendous. You can't see below the waist, so it is very difficult to learn anything that is done with the hips or legs! Try something else."
1,.....,"....BR>Firstly, the camera focuses more on dolphina's face than the areas being worked. For instance, when doing hip isolation you don't see dolphina's hips for more than ten seconds. The rest of the time is spent focusing on her smiling face. Meanwhile, you can end up with major back stress/pain if you don't already know the logistics of the isolation exercise she's doing. If I didn't know some belly dancing moves prior to this video, my back would be in big trouble.Secondly, I didn't feel any burn. The moves don't really focus on toning muscles as much as I had hoped for. Every section is only about five minutes long and, again, either her lack of instruction or the camera only focused on her face made me perform the move wrong so I didn't reap any benefits..... If you're looking for a video that's about dolphina's smiling face, then you've got the right workout. If you really want to have fun and get toned, don't buy this video."
2,Not recommended for Beginners,"Yes-Dolphina is beautiful and it's good she is comfortable with herself but as an instructor...Her explanations of the different moves are brief, often not clear, and sometimes down right wrong. Camera angles often focus on one body area with very little full body shots on the more difficult moves. Correct terminology is not used to name the different moves. Her constant flirting with the camera is creepy. Don't know if she is flirting with the person behind the camera or the targeted audience.So how to use this tape:Would be difficult to use as a first time introduction to belly dance because it is so unclear. And I feel gives the wrong impression of the dance. More for someone that knows and understands the moves already. But also for those who would enjoy the spiritual reference throughout the tape to the Hindu chakras."
2,Goddess Workout Review,"Wonderful images and costumes. Unfortunatly, the video contains more footage of her face and chest areas than her feet. Her costumes hide her legs so you can not see how the moves are done. She is a beautiful dancer and the music is lovely but for beginers it is not a tape I would recomend. More experinced dancers might get something out of it but overall if your new to dancing do not get this tape."
5,Royal Canin,I have two Boston Bulls and they have sensitive stomachs. I find this food does not upset their tummy.Thanks jane
5,"brilliant ""dream""","this is a wonderful last record from sf's mk ultra. ""original motion picture soundtrack"" was one of my favs from 1996. this band was beyond obscure while they were around, now they seem to be reaching cult status."
5,Clear and patient training,"I own a few of Ms. Stotts videos and find them all to be a great source to workout with. She walks you through each step clearly and simply. In this particular video, a handy pop-up screen appears at the appropriate time in the right hand corner, to display modifications to the exercises for your body's abilities. I highly recommend her tapes."
2,Terrible Quality,"I recieved my Gmini 402 as a gift a year ago. After only a few months it had already broken (the headphone jack broke). Though I sent it in and had it repaired, when it came back it could now only hold 18.3 gb rather than 20gb! I called customer service (finding the number was an almost impossible feat) and the person on the line dismissed me saying that I didn't know anything and that nothing was wrong.I find it a difficult gadget to use and it takes a long time to find what you're looking for. The more you have in it, the longer it takes to find the song/album you're looking for. The video screen is just to small to be practical and it only plays files that are supported by Windows Media Player so forget about any RealMedia or Quicktime files you may have.I would not recomend Archos as a company to buy anything from. And I certainly would not recomend this product to anyone. Period."
1,100% disappointed with Amazon,"I could not use it, the product I received was defective.Item seems like returned item, I ordered for a new Item. It doesntlook like original packing.Navigation key up arrow is not working. I had to return it on the same day I received the item."
5,Great product,I've had my player for about a month and love it. Some of the features I like the best are the ability to play back movies on a TV with RCA connection cables that come with it and the ability to do line in recording. I recently recorded for 2 hours at sampling rate of 16kHz (lowest sampling rate) and it created about a 400 meg file and still sounded good. Also my son loves the games that came with it (just samples). I would recommend this player.
1,Functionality: 4 Reliability: 1 Customer Service: -2,"The device worked well and was a joy to use. For about two months. It then refused to turn on. I had to send it back to Archos. About a month later I receive a replacement. The replacement had a shoddy D-pad and couldn't recharge. Obviously nobody even checked to see if it worked before sending it to me. Had to send it back. It's been about 5 weeks so far and I have to keep calling, listening to some lady who only works there 2 days a week complain about all the problems they have with the warehouse. I regret this purchase more than anything I've ever bought."
3,Not bad,If you are looking for stories about ancient artifacts this is not the book you would want to read. The first half of the book deals mainly with stone tools and the second half with ancient bones. There is a small chapter on other ancient anomalous artifacts that is quite interesting though. I found this book to be interesting although it goes into such detail to make some of it pretty boring. It's up to you how much background information you need or want to know. And if you need more information then is in this book try Forbidden Archeology. It's the same book with even more detail then this one. If that is possible.
2,Boring,It was a hard read for the non die hard enthusiast in paleontology. No real facts for any side of any argument
4,Forbidden Archeology; Hidden History of the Human Race,"A fascinating read, regardless of whatever theory one subscribesto. The geological record/notes are extensive, the subject ishandled in a scholarly, non-judgemental way and whether or notyou give credence to the information, it is interesting to get a behind the scenes look at academia and censorship."
3,Birthday present,This was another present to my husband. He loves history and he enjoyed reading this book. Recommended to all history buffs.
5,Now I must read...,"Now I must read the unabridged version (Forbidden Archeology(I think...)). This, if it were brought to(very) public light, would set evolutionism/Darwinism/paleontology/even Christianity all askew..."
3,High Hopes... Unfulfilled,"The title of the book is misleading. No ""hidden history"" of mankind is given. What the book consists of is a listing of archeological finds that suggest homo sapiens has been on planet earth for upwards of a million years or more. This view may be correct, but what homo sapiens was doing during all this time, how he lived etc, is hardly speculated on.Conventional historians have drawn a veil over anything dated before 2,500 BCE when they believe the Sumerian culture - apparently - spontaneosuly generated itself. The challenge is to break down this wall of silence. For my part, this book, while an enjoyable an informative read, doesn't provide an effective way to do that."
2,Hidden History of the Human Race,"Tedious. Excessive examples of ancient finds ""proving"" the existence of Homo Sapiens earlier than periods accepted by academia. I have not finished the book, having been bored to the point of needing to go on to other subjects."
3,Ok,"I didn't,t read all of this as I found it a bit tedious but good for anyone interested in ancient human history .lots of interesting finds but the author does write this like it is as a scientific document"
4,Very interesting book about secrets that everybody have the right to know about.,Evolutionists have suppressed secret upon secret that they didn't want people to know about. Probably because they had no answers to these secrets. There are a lot of archeological findings that never was published because evolutionists in leadership positions didn't like the findings.
2,unauthenticated foolishness with some good tangents,"While the ancillary material on cryptid hominids is well organized, representing a reasonably clean presentation of typically widely scattered material, the lion's share of the book is valueless for one simple reason: not one claim is substantiated. It would indeed justify rewriting human history were a machined steel component unearthed in an Ordovician matrix or a precisely carved stone tool found embedded in Mesozoic strata. Yet, despite the copious bibliography, there is not one footnote associating any of the outrageous claims with a verifiable, published source. Beyond that, some of the claims are just plain silly: for example, I have trouble seeing through the authors' eyes how a vaguely dumbbell-shaped outline in archaic shale is ironclad evidence that a shod human foot walked past in remote times. Mine the Internet for the useful cryptid material and save your money otherwise."
2,Not At All What I Expected,"This book was not at all what I expected, being instead a compilation of archaeological bone/skeletal remains found around the world."
3,Challenge to the Official Record,"This is a more concise and more clearly stated version of Forbidden Archeology. Some of the evidence is startling and, while some is questionable, so is much of the theory and evidence that supports the ""official record."" Since the authors present almost any and all contradictions to the academia's presentation of history as fact, it is up to the reader himself to discern what is likely to have occurred and what is unlikely. However, the authors have revealed many anomalies that cannot be safely tucked into the dominant paradigm. For more scientific challenges to that paradigm see ATLANTIS IN AMERICA: Navigators of the Ancient World, and GATEWAY TO ATLANTIS."
4,rock it out,The grandchildren enjoyed it once they got the hang of it. It is better on the hard wood floors than the rug
4,Great Toy,My five year old uses this toy at least once a day. We have competitons to see who can balance the best!
2,Nordic Ware Toaster Oven Broiler Set,"I was looking for a small broiler pan and this one seemed to fit the bill. Although it is clearly advertised as a ""Toaster Oven"" broiler pan set, the product description said it could be used in a conventional oven. I don't think I had it under my broiler (in my conventional oven) for two minutes, and it turned and warped like a cookie sheet, spilling the broth from the meat I was broiling onto the bottom of my oven (and I like to save the broth to make gravy). This may be a great product for a toaster oven, but I wouldn't recommend it for conventional use."
1,2-Piece Toaster Oven Broiler Set,"I would not recommend this broiler set at all. It is very small (I had lots of extra room in my oven). Also the nonstick coating started coming off after only one use, and this is the reason I returned it to Amazon."
2,not enough info,"As a healthcare provider myself, I was a little disappointed that the information, coming from a nurse was a bit too surficial -- lots of touchy-feelies, not enough hard core info.Reconstruction issues were glossed over. Brachytherapy was not described. Took me a long time to figure out how chemo and hormonal therapy fit together.Susan Love's and Vladimir Lange's books are better if you want to figure out what to do, fast."
3,Your Breast Cancer Treatment Handbook,"I think the book is very comprehensive and answered some of my questions BUT I also felt that reading it just after I was diagnosed was extremely scary.In other words, I felt there was just too much information for me,and in some areas, too technical. I will, however, donate this book to our local hospital mammograph department as I feel they can use it well."
1,A big disappointment,Very disappointing! This book has very little information on the value of nascar diecast and it doesn't have pictures to correspond with the item description. It lists the cars by team rather than just by dirver so it has maybe 10-15 max car models per TEAM. If you are into Nascar collectibles you know there are lots more than just 10-15 per team. This book leaves a lot to be desired.
1,JOKE~!!!,"First of all, I HATE the BIG UGLY picture of American Car Racer...do not know his name, on the cover of the book. Second, I hate NASCAR and Cheap political HOT WHEEL junk I do not even care for looking at. The book should focus on HIGH QUALITY COLLECTIBLE BRANDS ONLY. What a waste of paper~!!!"
5,i love the kids in the hall,i watch the show all the time and i saw this cd at media play. i decided to buy it and when i heard it i almost peed my pants. very funny cd by the kids in the hall.
5,Fantastic...Really really REALLY good...,This CD is a really good mix of music...Highly recommended to anyone
2,Where's Cancer Boy?,"""Whistle When You're Low"" by Cancer Boy is by far the musical highlight of the film (and it's a great movie by the way).I would have bought this album in a second if that song was on it, but without Cancer Boy, what's the point?"
3,Not what I expected!!,"When I purchased this pan, I was expecting a pizza with a crispier crust, but instead the edges came out crispy and the middle was soggy...might be my technique but I got a better effect for crispness with the silpat :)good luck hope this helped"
1,Too Personal,"Author provides limited insight into social work. This book is about his personal experiences when he crosses professional boundaries and becomes an ""Uncle"" to a client family. Not recommended."
3,Lost Treasures of America,More like an old library book. I wouldnt buy it in a store. Not really what I expected.
3,sarafinapsychic says,Dark deck. Pictures on line make me think it was brighter than it is. It is pretty though. Good if you're collecting.
3,Okay starter deck,"I purchased this deck, but was not particularly impressed with all of the imagery on the cards. I like some of the cards but overall wish I would have purchased another deck with better artwork."
2,"i didnt love this movie,and i didnt hate it either","this movie was just okay.i just simply didnt mind it.it was really just like ""salem's lot"".this movie had some scary parts but most of the time it was pretty boring.i can tell why it only got 1 and a half stars.dont waste your time on this movie"
3,Children Of The Night - Pray For Dawn,"Stylish Horror/Thriller That Goes Right For The Neck With Good Fashion...Allburg Is A Small, Far From Outer Culture, The Ideal Setting For A Vampire Movie...A School Teacher (Peter DeLuise) Is Summoned To Allburg When One Of His Friends Claims That He Is Holding Two Female Vampires Locked Up In His Bedroom...The Quiet Town Is The Focus Of Vampire Colonization When Each Townsperson Is Playing Host To These Demonic Creatures...The School Teacher, A Wino And A Teenage Girl Must Now Help The Town From Being ""Drunken Alive""...Plenty Of Gory Special Effects, And Splendid Acting..."
5,Awesomely Bad!,A vapire flick that is worth seeing more than once about a small town being overrun by vampires and the humans who are left standing are in the fight of their lives. But in the end good triumphs over evil and the story ends yet doesn't.
2,ok,Not the best of vampire movies but not the worst kind of vampire movies. It adds a couple of nmew twists to Vampire mythology.
4,Adventure in the classic style,"Carter continues his open tribute to Burroughs's John Carter of Mars series, with another John Dark of not-Mars. The formula is all there, with the multi-armed hordes of semi-civilized warriors, glorious princesses, flying ships, valiant swordplay, and all the rest. And, for those who haven't read ERB's original stories, Carter reminds us of a few points of story-telling style that the newer series (""No, really, I didn't write it - I'm just passing along what John himself gave me."")Well, no one criticizes tribute bands for playing familiar tunes in the style of, and I'm not criticizing Carter. These are wonderful sword'n'sandal stories in their own right, filled with the terrible beasts, power-mad foes, improbable coincidences, and frequent capture (four this time, if I counted right) that make these stories fun. Perhaps this doesn't rise to the best of ERB's originals, but it certainly stands ahead of the lesser ones.-- wiredweird"
2,"All That ""Nastyberry""","I love my Melitta One:One coffee-tea maker. But this razzberry flavor is just not that good. The weakness to the Mellitta brand is not the coffee maker, there is just not many pod varieties. Am personally trying out another supplier for the pods, with the exeption of the hazelnut coffee, and the traditional black tea."
4,Q: Is he a man? A: He is Jerry,"This is not a great album by any stretch. There is some uneven material, but there are some great songs too. As a vibe think more Doctor Detroit and less Whip It. Jerry I think finds a more organic soul infused sound, which ultimately works for most of the album.Mine Is Not A Holy War, is probably really for the DEVO fan (Mark may be the brains , but Jerry is the soul), but anyone else who is interested in a funky throwback album will be entertained."
4,Good one Jerry,"If you're a Devo fan, this is a must purchase. Great new songs, and great re-workings of some older Devo classics(?). Only a couple of clunkers, the rest are excellent!"
2,"should be called ""mediocre crash footage with guitar riffs""","Other than a couple of obscure crashes, there's really not much here. Admittedly, the title gave me high hopes and I was let down. If you like watching old footage of pilots crashing while landing on carriers though, you might get something out of it, but don't expect any information. Monologue is kept to a minimum and there's not a single bit of information on air-warfare conspiracy or any conspiracy. (...)"
4,Nutritional Cost of Prescription Drugs,"The book's biggest drawback is it's small size. The information it contains is excellent; there's just tons more drugs out there that the consumer needs information on. However, many commonly used drugs are listed. The index of brand names and generic names makes locating information a breeze."
1,Great! what are these stars for?,"I have to say I wasn't sure about this book when I first saw it. But I loved it the first time I touched a page! I can't get enough now! The paper is high quality, absorptive, and comfortable for sensitive behinds. There's plenty of page space so you never use more than one to wipe. And for those extra-long toilet sessions, you can read it and have a good laugh!"
1,Why don't fundamentalists want to believe science?,"It is very sad that certain groups who proclaim themselves Christians have decided that people are to believe in either God or in science, but one cannot believe both. As a Christian, this book insults my intelligence as it requires me to ignore basic scientific principles and explore and question the nature of things around me. We go to school to learn, to create questions and support our decisions with facts. This book won't allow for critical thinking.On a more basic level, this book attacks evolution rather than providing an explanation for creationism so at the end of the book the reader ""knows"" that evolution is supposedly wrong, but doesn't know why creationism is right.Christians can believe in both evolution and God, the two are not mutually exclusive and this book creates more confusion and questions then it clarifies."
4,Great for children with questions.,I bought this book for my daughter when she came to me with questions regarding why school taught her that the world evolved and I taught her that God created everything. The book was written for a 9-12 year old level. It was a good resource for us to use as we referenced the Bible for what God said about creation. The book help outline agruments for creationism and encouraged her to look at both sides of the issue. I would recommend for any child who is having difficulty intergrating their faith with the public school science program.
2,Confusing the Christians,"After having read many different books on creationism, the Second Law of Thermodynamics, Mount St. Helen's, Dating Techniques, Fossil records, etc; I was disappointed that a book claiming to offer biblical answers does not do that. The bible along with scientific evidence offers the answers we need (at least has done a far better job than the Darwinian evolutionists.) Another ploy to cofuse the masses and promote the only religion the schools allow...secular humanism."
1,Utter nonsense,"Creationist propaganda. This is a ridiculous book trying to poke holes in the Theory of Evolution. Since they can't provide any actual evidence, they resort to idiotic attempts like this. Pathetic..."
1,Unscientific nonsense,"Honestly just sad... if you really do want to brainwash your child with creationism, this is about as good as it gets. Scientifically illiterate, to me it seems just an attempt to justify a belief the authors already have with the meager shreds of science that happen to support their belief. Often, the science cited is incorrect, and/or not actually supportive. However, I would expect no less idiocy from such a book. Please, parents, as a teen, do not do this to your kids. Have more respect for them...."
1,This will cripple your children's capacity for science.,"As Richard Dawkins put it, ""I am against religion because it teaches us to be satisfied with not understanding the world.""The principles of science are to explore and find phenomena that challenge our models of the world, and build models to fit our findings. The principles of religion are to reinterpret findings until they fit the model that has been handed down over the years.Science makes progress. Religion fights it each step of the way....stuff like this is why the US is falling behind on the global theater."
3,"Cheap, but a little small","We got this small baking sheet to use in our toaster oven. It works pretty well, but the non-stick coating didn't last more than a year, it doesn't wash very well, and it's a little small for a toaster oven. It could easily be another inch or possibly 2 in each direction and still fit in any toaster oven I've ever seen. Don't expect this to be an amazing pan, but it works well enough to get the job done."
2,Nordic compact ovenware backing sheet,while in the oven toster the tray bend with temp.once cooled goes bach to original form.A waste of money
3,Kind of small,"Even though I use it in a regular sized convection/toaster oven, it could have been larger. Also, it warps while hot, but generally falls back into place as it cools."
1,Terrible quality,"The coating does not last - extremely poor durability. I've been very careful with this pan, using only wood or plastic utensils and washing by hand only. Didn't matter - within just a few uses, the coating flaked off and the edges on the underside are rusting. Waste of money!"
1,Nonstick finish flakes off,I would never buy this product again. The finish came off almost immediately. Don't waste your money.
1,Another dissatisfied customer,"Like other reviewers, I have this product and it began flaking fairly soon. I do not wash it in the dishwasher, it is handwashed only. Once it begins flaking, it continues flaking pretty rapidly. Try another brand.UPDATE: April, 2008. I've been using the Duncan Hines branded nonstick toaster oven pan for about a year now and it has performed flawlessly. A much better choice."
1,Nonstick Coating Flakes Off,"I REALLY loved this baking sheet when I first got it, so I was supremely disappointed when the nonstick coating began flaking off, essentially rendering it unusable. I may have gotten a bad batch or something. The product has a lifetime warantee and I do intend to send it back in, but wanted to let folks know about my experience."
1,Poor choice,"This little pan seemed perfect for my toaster oven. I read the reviews and read a lot of bad ones, also noticed they were older and thought may be the company had noticed and made improvements, I decided to chance it, the price was right.The pan worked perfectly, the biscuits were evenly done top and bottom. I paid close attention to the care and cleaning, but noticed each time I used it it became harder and harder to clean.The non stick coating was so soft it began to come off and crud was beginning to build up in the edges and corner and each cleaning made it a little worst. I have had the pan for only month and it looks like the old aluminum one that is 10 years old.I used this pan once and somtimes twice a day and cleaned it every time, it was not made for this useage, if I had used it weekly it would have lasted longer. I cannot find a pan to fit my toaster oven of this thickness, with a good non stick coating."
1,out-of-stock,This item was out-of-stock. I eventually cancelled the order. Amazon seems to have difficulties handling out-of-stock items anymore.
1,JUNK PAN,The coating flakes off within a couple of uses. This is the poorest quality bakeware I have ever seen. Don't buy it. Nordic should be ashamed of themselves.
5,toaster oven rack,"I got a toaster oven rack recently and its good to have. Somebody gave us a toaster oven, but it didn't have the rack, and I got one or two that were to big. Yours is just right. It is also sturdy. Thank you!"
1,"terrible, should be called 'stick' and not non!","I just put this sheet in the trash. I had it for awhile but rarely used it. Maybe five times at most. Each time the coating would come off and as other stated, the sheet would rust even though I hand washed it. I tried soaking it since everything seems to stick to it during and after cooking. Tonight, I could not get the food off of the pan. I tried. I came on here looking for a replacement and this one came up in the search. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. Off to find a better sheet for the future that will last longer."
5,The Greatest Punk Rock Record You Never Heard,"This is one of the most burning rock records ever to come out of Boston's fertile rock scene. It's a punk rock record made in the 90's, and yet its sound is fresh and original. Who'd have thought? Driving, pounding, buzzing, and shredding with excitement and sheer, smoking pleasure this is likely to be on many people's short list. Peter Prescott's urgent vocals, Malcolm Travis and Bob Moses' slammin' rhythm, and Ed Yazidjian's wild-monkey-on-Thunderbird-and-quaaludes guitar figures come together in one relentless rock throb like the good ole' days. I command you to love this record!"
3,Same Same,"The realization that all things we know and love evolved from a single form -- a continuum of sorts that continues -- is reinforced in classic Wilber style. The Buddha said it, Christ said it and so does Ken, again. I guess I was looking for a new twist. After all, it's a new book, right? With 99% of our thoughts being repeats -- silly me. Truth is, Ken Wilber is a fantastic neo-Buddist writer that puts things out there where you can see them. I first read his books back in the 90's and always remembered them. If you're new to Wilber, buy this one. You won't be disappointed. If you've already been there, reread the one you already paid for.--MarcusAuthor of WAKE YOURSELF UP"
3,good book,"ken wilber has written dozens of books on sprituality, philosophy and psychology. he is a very learned and wise soul. this is a compilation of thoughts and writings from his various works. there are nine sections in the book and each section is full of various articles and excerpts from his books. there are pros and cons to compilations; the pros is that you get a glimpse of a variety of writings, the cons is that it lacks flow. also the sections have some one line insights such as this: ""to say that matter, body, mind, soul and spirit are evolutionary potentials is to say both quite a lot and not very much."" that is taken from an introduction to one of his writings. it really doesn't go anywhere. this is a good book and great introduction to ken wilber's works though. when it's all said and done: ""spirit is the only thing that has never been absent. it is the only constant in your changing experience."" how true."
1,If I do say so myself.,What an awful and pompous title for a book! Is a piece of writing visionary becuase the author (or publisher) says it is? And don't we normally call poetic writings (sic) poems?Sigh.
3,Book Free Online,"I bought this as a required book for a college course. In the forward of this book it states that the book is available for free online. Just google ""Eco-Economy"" and you will find it in its entirety."
3,"Inspiring, a bit sparse on information","If you're interested in thinking about economics and being ecological and you don't know too much about it, this book is a nice read but take it with a grain of salt. If you get past the starry-eyed ""visionary"" thinking and wonder about the nuts and bolts then there are glaring omissions in the book as well as a many engineering, geopolitical and consumer issues that are glossed over or presented as if they will just magically happen (the wind power issues for instance)."
4,flexible exandable chimney sweep poles,These poles are strong and flexible. Screwing two of them together is not as easy one would like. However storage is nice since I can take them apart.
2,something about quality,I used it 2 times already.The treads on all ends are very bad quality from day one was not possible to tight more than 2 turns.
3,Entertaining......,"I was entertained by this cartoon, and a cartoon is all I hold it for. Most books to screen are lacking in plot following and expectations from the readers imaginations. Take it for what it is, a cartoon, and wish for improvements if you like, but hope that it leads to new fans reading the original series."
5,Enjoyable Movie,My family really enjoyed this movie. It was funny and kept the attention of it's audience. I would buy more like it.
3,Its fun,"I decent cartoon based on one of my favorite stories, Sadly now I cant read any of the books with out hearing Jack Baur as the voice of Raistlin"
2,Books ARE BETTER,"Unfortunately my hopes were dashed after I watched this animation. The movie makes it appear that everything, that happened in the book, took place in three days instead of three months. Let alone many details were irritatingly left out or misplaced throughout the movie. They even mispronounced Bupu.Purchase this if you must, but only as a collector's item."
3,Pleased but yet not!!!,"I was happy to see the books I fell in love finally get the push into the right direction. It was neat seeing the charters brought to life and if you hadn't read the books, it gives ya a good idea what the story is about. For us fans that have read the books, the movie stayed with the story for the first half and then from there I was disappointed. It was like "" Uh oh, we are running out of time let's just butcher it and rush through to the end"". To do it right, it needed to be either a longer movie or made into two. I still recommend it, but just want to warn ya a head of time. They did good with what budget and time they had to work with. Hopefully this will guide the books to live action. So for the Dragonlance epic is following right in step with the all mighty Lord of the Rings live action movies. ( they too were cartoons before live action) So if you have read the books or you haven't, give it a try. I still found it worth sitting down and watching it."
1,An insult to all fans,"The blending of CGI and cell animation is awkward and the cell animation is weak and inconsistent (e.g. blood is used in some scenes but not others). Similarly, the voice acting is weak, especially given some of the well known names. The adaption itself seems geared towards kids -- characters are simplified and some are even given personalities that don't match up with the book.I have watched several English dubs of Anime (Japanese animation) and given that context this film is even worse than most people think!For those not familiar with Anime try watching The Twelve Kingdoms or Moribito. Hasbro should hand the license over to Kenji Kamiyama and let him run with it. He's shown in Moribito and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Lone Complex that he's a master at adapting worlds and making the world and the characters seem real.It's embarrassing to see Tracy Hickman -- who gave it a 4 star review on here -- even try and defend this."
2,huge fan...huge disappointment,I waited a long time for this. It is horrible. And I will probably watch it again ;)
1,*YAWN*,"I've been a fan of Drangonlance ever since I was in my early teens, and even I couldn't bare to finish this movie. It's boring, uninspired, and an embarrassment. Dragonlance fan or not, stay away from this one."
2,Bad animations,This movie does not do the acclaimed DragonLance trilogy any justice. So do not watch this movie before you read the books.
1,waste of time and money,"do not buy this unless you are okay with being disappointed. seriously. there is nothing redeeming in this movie whatsoever. if you are a fan of the dragonlance series, hope for a proper remake, as this movie will only infuriate you."
4,A daunting task...,"I know that some us are disappointed. I was, to some degree, disappointed myself. I must ask, could the hopes of us, the fans, have truly been realized? This is a wonderful introduction to a story that must be read. Watch it with someone who has never enjoyed the series and then hand them the first book to read."
3,Not as bad as everyone says,"I had heard nothing but bad reviews before I saw this movie and had no expectations. What I found was that I was not as disapointed as I thought i would be. Sure it is not perfect, but I am happy to see some of the fantasy genre's most loved characters come to life. I was a little uncomfortable having to explain to my wife that there is not that much cleavage in the book, and a little disturbed when Tika bounces her chest around. Especially a little wierded out when I thought that her voice was the star of the Ice Princess. Overall, I was entertained and recomend it for the fans of the books."
4,Enjoyable,"All in all i found this movie to be rather enjoyable. i have been a big fan of the books for a long time so i kind of went into it expecting one thing but trying to keep an open mind. Like with any other movie based on a book it comes up short in areas, after all how you imagine the story will always be different than what someone else imagines. Secondly, i thought that the voices when the next best thing to being perfect as there could be, they just seem to fit well with the characters. The one big flaw that i did see in the movie is that some of the main storyline twists and plot adders were removed to make it fit the time frame. i would love to have seen this movie extended out to 2 or even 3 hours to be able to fit it all in but since that was not the case, i still enjoyed it emmensly."
3,A beautiful story coming to life,"A felicitous adaption of the fantasy novel.One has to remember two things:1. The film could not last much longer than 90 minutes.2. It had to be an adaption also accesible for younger viewers.Keeping these two things in mind will help you to enjoy the film. If you have read the novel, do not expect too much, this isn't a ""Lord of the Rings"" film adaption! It's a cartoon with a nice drawing-style. Unfortunately the draconians, which appear in the film, have been made using computer animation and these two techniques do not combine well.Many details from the book have been omited, but all the important things are there. If you are a Dragonlance fan this DVD is certainly worth buying."
1,"Horrid, Horrid Animation","Wow, I have seen better animation in programs from the 1970's, this movie was extremely painful to watch. For anyone that enjoys the books or anyone that enjoys a good animated show please rent this movie before you go out and buy it."
2,For the Dedicated - or not,"This adaptation, if you will, of the original book in the voluminous Dragon Lance series is OK if you're looking for a Saturday morning cartoon version (with some more adult-style drawings intermingled) of this excellent tale. I was entertained enough to watch it to the end, but I knew the story and was amused at the portrayal of some of the characters. But it is what it is - something fun that should neither come with super high expectations or leave one with major disappointments. I'd rather watch it than most of the reruns on TNT on a Saturday afternoon, if that helps. See the previous review by one of the authors for a more complete breakdown."
2,Could have been done better!,"The DVD was a disappointment for me, because of the fact that I was anxiously awaiting it release. Margaret W. and Tracy H. had me hyped about its release when they told me about at their book signing at the Fort Bragg PX. The DVD was woefully edited and I wouldn't been able to follow the storyline if I hadn't already read the book. If you had not already purchased the DVD, rent it first or borrow it, whichever. It would be to your advantage."
2,It could have been so much more.,I've been waiting for 14 years and it could have been amazing had they not blown their budget on the voice actors and had put more effort into quality animation. Hopefully there will be a sequel and and they take the comments from their fans to heart.
2,OUCH,"The only thing this has in common with the books are the people's names and places.At least I know how to pronounce some of the different looking names.I was very very disappointed when I sat to watch it.I understand editing for time and content - but changing the whole story is wrong.Honestly, I am glad my fiancee cannot find a copy in Italy, she would be more heartbroken than I am.At least I will still have the books."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I am extremely disappointed, with the quality of today's independent films and the voice talents involved in this sorry excuse for a movie, it should have been a much better film. The animation looks like a throw back from the early 80's. They must have blown there budget paying the actors for there voices and had nothing left for the animation. Not to mention the total lack of quality control, from one seen to the next, there are too many inconsistence's to go into. This film doesn't even come close to doing this story justice. Again I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED"
2,Where'd the money go? Kiefer's bail?,"Wow! Talk about busting the bank. It looks like they started making CGI movie, cool enough. But when the budget ran out, and from the looks of it the budget ran out early, they drew the rest of the movie in bad, early-80s, 2-D animation.Too bad, I was expecting something at least equivalent to Batman the Animated series.It would have been better if they did the whole movie the 2-D animation, then it would have at least been consistent! I would have preferred having the characters voiced by unknown, well cast beginners than spending the money on Lucy and Kiefer and having horrid animaition!"
2,Not what I was hoping for.,Having read the first six books and several other books related to the series I purchased this DVD in hopes of viewing an animated version of one of the best fantasy book series out there. After watching the first few minute I had to check the date on the box to see if I was watching a show made in the 80's. Nope...copyright 2008...after that I said to myself do not judge this by the looks of the animation focus on the story...I then felt like I was watching a chopped up version of the story where part of the story were forced into the movie to be somewhat close to the book. I watched the movie till the end and felt a little ripped off. But more than anything I was sad by the poor quality (think original animated Hobit that was better) of the animation and the poor story telling that this movie provided. I hope that another animation or even a live action movie would be made of the Dragon Lance series that would truely tell the story as it is written.
2,I hope this is just a first step,"As I watched, I kept telling myself that this is a painful, necessary step towards making a non-animated motion picture. Hopefully, the Dragonlance story will follow the same path that the Lord of the Rings storey did; begin with fantastic books, move to cheesy animated movie, become a very good non-animated motion picture. I've been a fan of the books for 20+ years and coincidently, not knowing about the movie, just re-read the Chronicles and Legends trilogies. My opinion may be a bit harsh due to the fact that I feel close to the characters and original storyline."
3,teenager cult cartoon,"The first time we rented this was going to be the last.It may appeal to Dragonlance followers and to be fair, it is creative. But the animation is only average and the dialoge is stilted, even for a cartoon.However, my teenager and his friends have watched it several times with the sound turned off and laughed their heads off as they make up their own dialoge. So we finally bought a copy. Personally, I'd rather watch the animated cartoon ofthe Hobbit. But my teenager and his friends think this cartoon is a lot of fun."
2,Disappointment,"I will make this quick as many have already clearly stated many of the flaws. As many of you, I loved the books - grew up with them and D&D;, and was extatic to hear about the movie.Long story short, the animation is way sub-par for todays standards (truth be told, sub-par for 20 years ago). Great call in some of the actors for voices, but it may have been better to spend the money on quality animation and got some lesser known actors.I sat through it just to see the story told, but will not buy the video and will not see the rest of the series if done. I will stick with the images in my imagination from reading the novels rather than have my memory scared more by this disappointment."
1,Dreadful!,"As a long time fan of the DragonLance series I was woefully disappointed. When I was a kid, I was enthralled by the amazing art of Larry Elmore and the other DragonLance artists. They created the images that I saw come alive in the books. To see the characters portrayed the way they were in the video was almost sickening. It was like watching a project created by teenagers during a studyhall in school. The women were overly sexified, the battle scenes weak and the overall story just clunked along.I should have listened to the wife and rented it first. I can't imagine I'd waste my time watching it again. Not even Tas would bother acquiring this item. It would be more suited to be used as a torture device by the Dark Queen."
2,"Could be worse, but not much.","I remember as a kid my disappointment when I watched the Hobbit and LOTR cartoon movies. I thought that compared to the books the movies were no comparison. I feel the same way about DOAT, it took a great story with great characters and turned it into a video comic book. It was a mildly animated slideshow with voiceovers.I have no interest in seeing a sequel, but I am holding out hope for a live action film that respects the original characters and storyline."
2,Animated Dragonlance,If I've never read the book than this film would be so much better but since I've read the book the movie pales in comparrison.
2,Dragonlance-Vol 1,"When I first heard of this title coming out as a cartoon, I really had great expectations. But I was to be let down, in a big way. The animation has a very 1980's feel to it. I almost expected He-man to pop out somewhere and give a hand while the Transformers blew something up in the background. The story is disjointed and as a big fan of the novels I couldn't help but scream"" But what about such and such or wheres this part"".The voice talent seems to have been wasted on lack luster art work and very poor scripting.If your a big fan buy it for the collecting side not the expectation that one of your favorite books is coming to life. Sorry guys but this one as flop and in a big way."
4,Dragonlance - Dragons Of The Autumn Twilight,"I find myself watching this movie once every couple of weeks, due to my fondness of the Dragonlance book series and enjoy it for what it is. Although not perfect by any means the story is fairly close to the book with a few inconsistencies but nothing completely unacceptable. I did find the voice acting to be well chosen, the soundtrack good. I do hope they are able to finish animating the rest of the trilogy, perhaps learning from the mistakes of this film and appliying it to the next."
4,I agree more along the lines of Tracy Hickman,"I've had many ideas pop into my head since reading Dragons of Autumn Twilight when it was introduced. Visions of a movie, making my own stories involving minotaurs, and more.Now that we finally have a movie, I'm reminded of how bad the LOTR animated movie was before LOTR was redone by Peter Jackson. It also reminds me of ""The Hobbit"". That movie was very poorly done.Although animated films of some of our favorite stories fall way short, they still can remind us how great the stories are/were. I'd recommend this to all my friends who enjoyed DL because in my mind it makes the stories from the books shine. Someday maybe we'll have movies that do the same."
3,good but could be better,Well ive loved the books for years now and read all the main books and i was so happy to hear this was finally out. I had high expectations for such a good series. the movies animation was relatively horrible compared to what it could have been. but not too bad and it was surprisingly close to the book of course with a lot taken out for time. The characters were lacking and they kind of turned it into a somewhat lame game type of a movie but other than that it was alright. i would only recommend this too fans of the book to compare to the book but other than that its just suited for children rather than adults who have never read the books.all in all its was an ok movie
3,Great to see story come to life. Thats the only thing that was good about it.,"I was really excited to see the dragonlance series come to life. I was really sad that it was done so poorly. I was dissapointed in the way the characters were portraied, exspecially tasslehof hes my favorite. Tasselhof was moor like a punk teenager than the marry little kender that does the littlest things but they turn out to be so huge. If the people that maid this film put a little more effort in to it they could come up with something really spectacular. I hated the way they maid it seem like every thing only took a day or two. In the book it seemed like it took a week just to escape from the robed draconians when they first saw them. I love the books but didnt like there crapy attempet at the movie."
3,Reall glad to see this,"It's been over 15 years since I last read the Chronicles books from Dragonlance that this DVD is based on. In fact a lot of the movie was like a refresher course for me because I did not remember the different beats to the plot. As others have said, the animation is not fantastic, but I will say it is light years better then anything we had in the States here in the 80's. Just the fact that they were able to get such great actors to play the characters from the books and get a movie made out of it was a huge step for me. It's not as bad as some make it out, but it's not that great either. Definitely worth checking out. I rented it, and liked it."
3,Needs to be a live action movie.,"I am not a reader. Never have been. But.....20 years ago I read Chronicles and Legends in about a month (no small feat). I was always left breathless and wanting to read more. Over the past years I have read all of the Hickman and/or Weiss books written about Krynn. On off times I even got into the forgotten Realms books by Salvatore which are also very good. Still...I'd rather see the movie. Although it is nice to see Dragonlance on video, what this franchise needs is a live action movie trilogy of Chronicles. Done right, and true to the books, I imagine it would be better than the LOTR movies, and maybe even (gasp) Star Wars. I sure hope some producer or studio takes an interest in making them. Anyway, make sure to read all of the Hickman/Weiss books because they are all fantastic. Write your local studio to put together a live action movie!"
4,Excellent,I highly recceommend this movie if you have read the books. I would like to see the rest of the Chronicles and Legends included as well....Can't Wait.
3,Average Cheese...,Have to say that I was a little let down with this cartoon.I think this was put together very quickly.The Lord of the Rings cartoon was better for its time.This should have a little better quality for the story.I think I will stay with the books.
4,Sticks to book--good overall,"As a huge fan of the books, I enjoyed the movie, and it stuck more or less to the books. However, the ending could have been pulled together a bit better. The animation is unique in that it combines traditional animation with CG."
5,Wow! Cool movie!,"They really keep it as close to the book as possible. Very well done. As for the animation, it's not exactly Disney quality, more like Saturday morning cartoon. After a while, I didn't notice it so much."
4,Not as bad as others have said,"A lot of people are giving it low ratings because the animation technique is old. They combined good modern animation with old school animation. Well, that tells me that they ran out of time or money, but the content is good and it's an entertaining film. Isn't that what films are supposed to do? It was a good first DL movie. If enough people buy it and support it, they might get more funding for a sequel with more fancy animation."
1,Very disappointing - terrible animation,"It's unfortunate that a strong story like the Chronicles series gets a very heavy handed treatment in this animated film. I'm surprised it was even released, but they should really take this film and bury it.I tried to like this film and watch it through, but I couldn't. The animation might be the worst I've seen...ever. Everything looks vaguely like old episodes of He-man, but worse. Characters don't move smoothly, and action sequences are downright embarrassing. The sad thing is that the poor animation becomes so distracting that you can't concentrate on the story or even tell if the voice acting is any good.I never would have thought that a movie version of these books could be this terrible, but it is and people should stay away. Buy the books, they're amazing."
1,SKIP THIS AND GET RECORD OF LODOSS WAR,"After years of having a great image of this series in my mind, it has been shattered. Unfortunately for us fans, the director and animators didnt seem to like the story one bit. The animation was lackluster even compared to day to day cartoons. The pace of the action was very slow, the art didnt do it any justice. I am sorry for the voice actors as they lend their talent for such lacking products. It is possible that they spent too much money in the voice talent and dropped the ball using a less than qualified animation studio. Very very unfortunate. Not even the CGI looked appealing.I don't criticize this product for being a purist. I criticize it by comparing it with similar products and other animations. If you want to see a good D&D; animated video, skip this one and pick up Record of Lodoss War, the original 13 chapters. Its not from the Dungeons and Dragos family, but its what any D&D; animator should look up to! You will have a better time."
1,What the Heck,"The animated movie SUCKED the animation looked like it was from the 70's ( the old hobbit cartoon) they butchered the book, the only saving grace was kiefer sutherland as raistlin.I have read the Dragonlance series hundreds of times, had to buy the Chronicles and Legends several times because wore them out reading it so many times. What these so called movie makers did to Margaet Wies and Tracy Hickman is a mockery."
1,Terrible 1.49 Stars,"Poor animation, which is pretty important in an animated film. It simply looked bad on my LCD TV. Some draconians are in a cheap computer animation, which doesn't mesh well. Maybe it looks better on a very small screen.It mixes wanna-be Saturday morning animation with scenes of hanging bodies, so do not let the kids watch. Too bad because kids are often more forgiving. It can't make up its mind what it should be. Its really hard to believe this came out recently."
1,Sadness Abounds,I am a huge fan of the Dragonlance books and was very happy to see this was out and figured maybe they would make the other novels into movies as well. After watching it I sure as heck hope they do not. Another example of a rushed job to try and make a little cash at fans expense.
2,Disappointment,"This was something I looked forward to watching but couldn't believe how poor quality, low budget the production was? I forced myself to watch this to the end. They had some big names doing the voices but you will ask yourself why? It was unnecessary. It would have been better if the producer used people off the street to do the script and put the money saved into the quality of the film. The biggest standouts for me were the animations, CGI Draconians and Dragons. They didn't work, movements and art was weak. The contrast between CGI and the cartoon characters was painful to watch. It would have been better if the CGI were cartoons like everything else. Overall, this is best described as a terrible 1980's animation. The Dragonlance Chronicles were awesome books; this childish cartoon did them no justice."
1,Ugh!!!,"This was horrible!!! I've been a huge fan of the dragonlance books. I thought this might be a good way to show my husband the world of Krynn and the characters I've been following. I was wrong! First off they didn't do a good job portraying the characters. The voices used sounded more like boys who are going through their voice change than adventurers! The animations just are cheesy especially the draconians. The draconians didn't move half the time and just glided across the screen. They were done in a completely different style than the rest of the movie. It looked as if they started designing the draconians in detail then decided it wasn't worth the work, gave up, and didn't do it in any other part of the movie. The way the rest of the movie was done was more reminiscent of the cartoons when I was little when they all looked hand drawn. Poorly done movie. A disgrace that doesn't deserve the dragonlance name."
2,Let down by high expectations.,"Although the Dragons of The Autumn Twilight does capture, for the most part, the essence of these beloved characters, the format seems to rush the story.One can tell a great deal of time was spent on some sequences and artwork while others were rushed. The end result is a flat artistic style which takes away from the original story.Fans of the book will still like this product, however, do not get your hopes up. In time perhaps we will see more time and money devoted to bringing this project to the screen in a way with more substance, grace and beauty."
3,dragons of autaumn twilight,"The characters in the movie were VERY much on the money compared to the books. The story followed the book but in my opinion tried to put in TOO much in an hour and a halfish movie.I would have LOVED to have seen this movie done with live characters or CG, like Beowolf. The animation was only ok for me."
3,"Not great, but not so bad","Been waiting for something like this for over 2 decades... remember reading these books when they first came out in the 80's, and hoping for something like this.Ok, they deviated a bit, and some focus on characters is lacking. That Movie should have been split in 2. 1st one would have been up to defeating Onyx and seeing the fire over Solace. 2nd one would have been the rest. 3 hours would have done Autumn twilight more justice.I watched it like 3 times, and know I'll watch it again. Even though I cringe at some parts of the movie. It's nice to see this story animated. I think they did awesome on Tasslehoff, and not too bad with Tanis. Only 2 characters that really stood out, with Raistlin coming third. I think the one major mistake was to give more details than necessary in this movie. Some things we where not really supposed to notice until book 2. Oh well. Like it, and hate it. I'll just have to be content with it. :)"
3,Dragonlance DVD review,"Dragonlance - Dragons Of The Autumn TwilightDragonlance , If you have read the book you will enjoy this dvd , if not it might bring you into the fantasy world of dragonlance and begin you on a adventure of buying the books ..Voice acting was great ! animation was horriable , i would perfer the movie all in 2d , but thats from a old He man fan .Enjoy , watch, but dont want to much out of it ."
1,0 stars an option?,"If 0 stars were an option that's what this DVD would get. I preordered the DVD when I first heard about it, and was expecting an at least passable effort by the production crew, but it was awful.I won't go in to details, as many, many of the other reviews here will point out the problems. Just know this is the first DVD I threw away after watching..."
1,"Terrible, and not even entertaining!","Sadly, I have to agree with every negative review about this sorry effort. It's all around bad. Bad! BAD!!!The only thing I haven't seen mentioned so far is that the Elves have ears so long that they look like donkeys! But maybe I haven't made my way far back enough into the 1- and 2-star reviews... yet...I'm glad I rented it - and even the couple of bucks at the movie place were a waste of money, considering that I switched it off in disgust after an hour or so."
1,Horrid,"I was very excited to hear about this project. After seeing some preview animation, I lost some of my excitement but still decided to give it a shot. I made it through 15 minutes and had to turn it off. Perhaps a 5yr old would enjoy the animations and dialog, but for any adults who grew up enjoying the book series, they will be vastly disappointed."
1,Find it in discount bin first !,"Pass this one by unless you see it in the $5.00 discount bin along with the other D&D; discs as a bundled set...er, make that bungled set.Also, Hickman should disqualify/refrain from posting a 4-star reivew as biased as author of the works. In his reviewreview, he himself notices the flaws of this DVD, yet still thinks to rate it 4-stars?? It has the taint and seems too self-serving to allow an author to review own works."
1,Terrible,"One of the worst animated movies I've ever seen, if not the worst. If you love the books, don't rent or buy this movie."
1,TERRIBLE,"Where to begin? They butchered the story, left out key characters, the animation is of such low quality that the 1980s GIJOE cartoon looks like animation masterwork by comparison, the CG characters are poorly animated. The list goes on and on.If there was a zero star rating -id give this movie that. A complete bastardization of the novel with iconic moments happening in the wrong location, major characters being left out of the story and even a romance that makes no sense between two formerly unrelated characters.This movie takes the heart and soul of Dragonlance - the characters of the Heroes of the Lance - and spits in their face. What a tagic disapointment at all levels.The voice acting here is wasted - Keifer Sutherlans, Lucy Lawless et al - so hard to emote when your characters facial expression never changes.Avoid this one at all costs"
3,Disappointing,I watched it but was too disappointed that they didn't spend more money on better animation or live action that i didn't really enjoy it. Some of the animation was just laughable and it looked like they couldn't decide on one style of anim. It seemed to change from scene to scene.I'll rewatch it again as a 'cartoon' I suppose and perhaps enjoy it more. I just really think they missed the ball on this. There are so many horrible cookie cutter movies and remakes these days I don't see why they don't sink some money into making a proper dragonlance movie. Too busy recycling the same old stuff i guess.
2,Kind of Entertaining,"There are many things that may contribute to the entertainment value of a movie, but I'm afraid that in this case it is all the wrong things. I found myself chuckling more often than not at the unmoving people in the background, the jiggling Tika, and the forced dialogue than at the parts where I was supposed to laugh.I completely understand the need to accelerate the action of a story to accomodate a 90 minute timeframe, but it is much more difficult to accept when the animation is that choppy, the CGI is that bad (and it's bad), and the voice acting just doesn't connect with the characters.Dragonlance is a great series because it is well conceptualized, and well written. Hopefully if a sequel is attempted it will hit closer to the mark."
1,I would give it a 0 star if I had that option,Bad beyond bad. Awful beyond awful.One of the best stories ever written and yet nearly unwatchable due to the mixture of computer animation and 80's animation. They clash horrible.I'm already written more than this movie actually deserves.
4,A Must for the DL fan,Ok... so they changed a little but overall close to the story... great job with voices! It isn't the live action movie that I always hoped for but now my kids will enjoy DragonLance too!
3,"Crappy, yet still pleasing","We all know that his movie was of pretty low quality, especially for something made not too long ago. However, I've come to terms with it. I loved this series, it remains today one of my favorites. And while I wish very much that it came to a better fate, if this movie is what I get then I'll take it anyways. Even in this poorly-made animation it is heart-warming to see my favorite characters come to life. If you are a fan of the books at least rent the movie or watch it online. You don't have to buy it, but at least see it!"
3,Nostalgic... but could be far better,"Well, if this were launched back in the middle 90s, i would give a 5 stars, since it captures the magic of the AD&D.;But with the 3rd edition graphic update and a more realistic call from the movies today, well.... this passes far away.At least, it is a nostalgic work, maybe a remind of the AD&D; times."
1,Fail,This movie failed to entertain even while it was in the microwave. I don't know why anyone that works in the fantasy genre would have allowed something like this to be made. This is why we don't have nice things.
1,Heartbreaking.,Terrible. Just heartbreaking for any fan of the Dragonlance saga. Stick to the novels and the games. Appalling on every level.
1,My memories...,"When I heard they were finally making a DL movie I was happy. I knew the review for this were bad. It was on sale and I couldn't resist...I just want to thank Tracy and Margaret for raping my adolescent memories. All in the name of making another few bucks? Which is a real shame because I have met the both of them at Gen Con and they seemed nice. Tracy's protestation to the contrary seem disingenuous given how obviously bad this thing is.I got the impression that the script writer was given an outline of major plot points and given free reign as to how to get there. The dialog is stitled, the voice acting (from a cast I had high hopes for) were clearly phoned in. On the other hand, the music was well done.If I could make it to Gen Con this year, I would take this with me and demand they give me my money back...I feel robbed."
1,Absolutely Horrible,If your a fan a of the Books you will be highly dissapointed. Important parts of the story were cut out and the graphics were better in the 1980's.. I knew from seeing the trailer online it was going to be bad but I bought it anyway cause im a huge dragonlance fan.. But I really didnt know it was going to be that bad..
2,Wrong target,This book can easily rival Lord of the Rings. The animated cartoon was horrible and was hastily put together. I admit some editing of the story will be required to tailor it to a more mature audience.
3,Slightly Disappointing,"I've been a huge DragonLance fan from the beginning, and I was hoping for so much more than this movie gave me.The combination of 3D and 2D characters fighting hand to hand looks bad.The dialogue is very very brief and basic, hardly any character depth. I've read the books so many times I know the characters thoroughly, but if someone who has never read the books watched this movie, I doubt they would be impressed by the flat character portrayal.Don't get me wrong, I love the DragonLance series, I own most of the books written, over 150, this movie is just another addition to the collection, and I sincerely hope they complete the trilogy in movie form even if it is animated. I just hope and pray they do a much better job.This movie is like a poorly animated ""Cliffs Notes"" version of a fantastic book."
1,Do not buy!,"I have been a Dragonlance for the better part of twenty years and I strongly suggest that you pass this one up - unless of course you want to see your favorite characters butchered by terrible animation and worse plot cuts. Overall, I'd say this DVD is best avoided."
3,Disappointing,"If you read and enjoyed the books as I did, then you'll be disappointed with this animated movie that just barely follows the story line, and cuts all the important parts out. It's entertaining as long as you don't expect it to be good."
2,A hack of the story...,"Personally, i didn't enjoy this adaptation....dragonlance has been the number one fantasy novel of mine since i start reading books.....With that said...i know that the adaptation would never live up to what my mind could create of this world but i didn't expect it to fall so short...i watch ALOT of japanese anime that doesn't rely on cgi...and the quality of the animation is top notch..this was shoddy...this was pathetic...this was sad....this was a hack....i would be happy if it was never produced in the first place....the only good thing i can say is that it touched on the main points for a condensed version of the book....otherwise....if this was my introduction to the world of dragonlance...i wouldn't be interested in reading the books...*Sigh*...oh well...hopes dashed.....i will have to live in my head for a bit longer until some faithful person or production team with money decided to do it justice...."
5,FANTASTIC!!!!,If you were a fan of the books then you really will enjoy the dvd. I read the books when they came out several years ago and throughly enjoyed them and have to say that the movie was just as good!!
2,Need help from the gods,"well where do I start? This is the worst. when I was 15 I baught these books, I went to an art school so that I could make cartoons out of these books. I was very glad to hear that these books where going to be made into a movie. Now my problen is this, for one, the dragons didn't have riders, Michael Trentembaun voice was wrong for Tanis (his other work as the flash is better), The CGI was horrible, Why was the draconian done that way? The fight scenes is where you really know that you are watching a third rate job. The Qunesti city was just wrong. When Tanis and the companions meet with the speaker of the sun where is the tower that the speaker works in. Or that city, and the turtle farry. I have every dragonlance book ever releace and I baught this so that they keep on making more, I understand that the story going to be change a bit to fit in into a movie but they butcher it. please, please do better on the next one"
2,Hardcore fans steer clear,"If you are a hardcore fan of the series, you should stay away from this movie. It'll do nothing but upset you. They leave out very key parts. Sturm didn't walk into the Inn with Goldmoon and Riverwind. Fizban was totally ridonkulous. He was even in green! Such a minor detail and they didn't get it right. They totally left out the growing relationship between Tanis and Riverwind, Raistlin and Bupu. The whole movie felt rushed. And I agree with Tracy's earlier comment that this would have been left a lot better as two movies. More of the important things could have been put in. I seriously hope that if they do make a movie of the second book, they read all the user reviews and realize where they went wrong."
2,On par with an Uwe Boll adaptation (That's not a good thing...),"The traditional 2D animated style is very acceptable. The 3D animated portions of the film are distracting, and don't bode well for this film at all.The adaptation seemed rushed, and too many major confrontations were completely altered from the original storyline. Too much time spent on Tanis' annoying lack of faith. Also too much time was spent beating us to death with the fact that Goldmoon can heal.If you're a mature fan of the chronicles, then stay away from this film."
3,The Intended Audience Should Beware!,"While most of this book is totally appropriate for young audiences, there is one severe drawback. One story tells in rather graphic detail about a young girl being tricked into her first sexual encounter. The probable audience for this book could definitely be children with an interest in native americans. Nothing about the book would warn an educator or parents about the graphic content."
4,Good size but short life,"I picked up this charge in combination with my Nikon 3100 camera. Since the battery it came with lasted a whole hour, I thought that the rechargeable would be a better option.It ended up being a yes and no. Yes, this thing is tiny, so it is easy to travel, carry and store. Yes it does charge in about 2 1/2 hours.Only problem is, after 2 hours of charging you get about 15-30 minutes worth of usuage.My recommendation is to go ahead and buy this, but get several pairs of batteries. This way you will have atleast one set ready to go, when the others die unexpectantly."
5,Definitely Worth Listening To,"Lasgo has really done something with their debut album ""Some Things"". Each song has the potential of becoming a number one hit. It is a very club friendly album with some hooks and vocals that will mesmerize you. You will find yourself singing or humming the songs all day.Basically, I have fallen in love with this album and strongly believe they will be a huge success. Hope they keep making more albums like this one in the future."
3,Belgian techno again,"Belgian techno did it first. Lasgo is Belgian, and it's techno. And it does it OK. Trouble is, I was expecting more than just ""OK."" ""Something"" is a great song, though. So is ""Cloud Surfers,"" albeit a bit too redolent of Robert Miles"
3,"Bakes well, hasn't held up as well as I'd like","I bought this pan a few months ago. I haven't had any problems baking in it -- I really like the fact that cakes and brownies cook more evenly without excessive browning at the edges. Unfortunately every time I cut the cake, brownies, bar cookies or whatever I've made, the knife scars the pan. Scratches and marks are fine -- I'm talking tiny chips and dings coming out of the pan. I don't know if this means I've got extra sharp knives or if the pan is made of extra soft metal, but I haven't had similar problems with my other cookware. In the future I'll be careful to use dull knives as much as possible."
2,Exhaustingly Detailed,"I've always had a need to dig deeper and find out more about those who have made an impact on me. I long to know what made them click. I adore Sam Cooke and knew little about him. I was hoping that this book would provide insight on the life of this man whoes voice I love.I am sorely disappointed with this book. The only thing preventing me from putting it down (unfortunately, I'm still in the middle of it) is sheer stubborness and the hope that it will redeem itself soon. I've probably skipped more pages than I've read. It's a pity that Sam isn't here to tell his own tale. It seems as if the author was able to locate everyone else who ever came in contact with him and allowed them to include their thoughts and opinions, whether the observation was pertinant to the story or not. I believe that many passages could simply have been ommited. And that if they were, the book would have been a far better (and shorter) read."
5,Guralnick delivers again!,A wonderful read! It is well-researched and full of details regarding Cooke's career. It is presented in an interesting but easy to read style. It's not just about Sam Cooke but the times he lived in. The civil rights struggle is a central part of this book. Sam Cooke is a fascinating and historically important musical career and Guralnick brings Cooke's life and career into focus. Highly recommended.Paul Evans
2,"A collage text book, not for experimentors","This is a good book for a collage student who does not know much about the pic. This is not a good book for experimenters, it is not an easy read, but it is very detailed on it's subject matter.If you are a beginner this book is not for you, it does not go into any detail of the code, either in assemble or C code, it does have lots of theory on machine code which I haven't used in 15 years.This book is good for the engineering student, but there are friendlier books on the pic out there."
5,Teaches Both Hardware and Software,"Whenever anyone thinks of a computer these days, something from Intel that uses the X-86 architecture comes to mind. But experience at universities have shown that while studying the X86 may be proper for a computer science major, the engineering student is more likely to be professionally involved with some other kind of processor of the microcontroller variety being used in some kind of embedded project.As a result, this book was developed along with a microcontroller based on the PIC 18 cpu. This microcontroller is supplied as a parts kit to be used with a prototyping board. It was discovered that supplying the student with a finished PC board led him to thinking of the computer as a monolithic device. Supplying the kit of parts makes him think of the components and a more skilled engineer results.This is a slightly different approach to teaching microprocessors that would leave the engineering student more capable of doing useful work after school."
1,You pay for what you get,I bought this and within a week the adhesive on the stone stopped working and the stone fell off and broke. From that point on it became more obsolete until my husband finally just threw it away with frustration.
3,Moderately good book for rock bottom basics.,"This is a moderately good book for a cursory covering of the basics. With a good narrative, and examples that are easy to follow, it takes you through building a simple system. The downside is it doesn't cover anything outside what is needed for its own requirements. It got me limping along but didn't take me much further."
2,Fair weather friend,"This tent is very easy to set up, and take down. It fits two kids, or one adult comfortably. This would be a great tent for fair weather camping. The first time I used it, it rained all weekend, and it leaked in each of the corners after the 3rd day of nonstop rain."
2,Coleman dome tent 7x7,The ground sheet has a tear and other areas also look ready to give. This is my second Coleman tent and compared very poorly to the first. The materials seem to be very light weight and not long lasting. Ground sheet does not hug to the ground. Overall a bit disappointed. I live in Saudi Arabia and the local tents appear to be of similar quality and much cheaper - sadly.
2,Not good in the rain,"This is a great tent if you like sleeping in an inch of water. On the plus side, it is very easy to set up."
3,Comes up short,"It does not measure 7'x5'. More like 6 1/2x4 1/2 interior floor space.The mat in the doorway is not attached to the tent, you must stake it down. Why bother with it? The ""pet dog door"" on the side I can't figure out what possible use it has. Just try and pack the tent in the storage bag after you first set it up. The factory must use a machine to fold the tent and extract every cubic centimeter of space when they package it.Other than these glaring faults I must say it appears to be made of quality materials and the price is right. I haven't used it yet so I can't comment on its waterproofness.Get some velcro straps to use after you roll it up or find a bigger storage sack to carry it in."
2,So So,"Bought this tent on a whim for an upcoming camping trip. A good tent for camping out of your car or truck, no backpacking with this monstrosity. Even after sealing the seams I did wake up to a puddle in the corner of the tent after a night of rain. Rain fly seems to be undersized and did not stay in place well in the wind."
5,Good one,"Perfect for one person, kinda tight for two (me and my wife both are 6'.1"") good construction, easy to assemble(10 min max), good materials.Would recommend."
4,check size!,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my parents. I bought it for them to use as a tackle box but make sure you check the size carefully. It looked fine in the pictures but it was a lot bigger than I expected. I'm keeping it just because it is nice for all kinds of storage but it is too big for a tackle box, unless you have a nice big boat."
5,"""Shadows"" a great resource","George Sibley has crafted a wonderful program with well-researched insights into David Thompson's life and times. The extra features are worth the price alone and are every bit as interesting as the main title. The short extra features are great for schools, museums and historical sites. George has focused on the context of Thompson in a way no others have attempted, from the intricacies of canoe building and geographic coordinates to his relationships with the languages and cultures of the Indian peoples of the Americas. A wonderful and masterful documentary!"
4,Good Job,This item seems to work very well.I have ordered it for many years and never had any probelms. Good job!
3,Filters,Worked fine.Priced right.Only problem they were shipped without carbon skin layered filter.Another online company includes the carbon with this filter.
5,Holmes filters,They were just what I needed and they are working great. Will know where to purchase when more is needed.
4,Green Veggies,"I wish they could get this into a pill. The taste isn't to bad but I can't quite mix it up all the way. Don't like the texture, I love the idea."
4,Pretty good,"I liked the pictures in the book which provided the narrative with a visual sense of history. This book is less strong on detail, but provides a marvellous breadth to anyone interested in finding out more about the U.S. special operations community."
3,Not that great,"I've read the first three of this book's twelve chapters. The coverage of logic is sometimes confusing, and the book was apparently written before there were different symbols for ""inclusive or"" and ""exclusive or"". Makes me long for Kenneth Rosen's masterful Discrete Mathematics textbook - why did I sell my copy?"
4,Standard and Fairly Thorough,"Michael Gemignani is a talented expositor, insofar as he is a clear writer and an ostensibly good mathematician who can convey ideas clearly. Of course, most of the material here is fairly standard, and perhaps the selection of some of the later material reflects some personal interests, there is nothing complicated here (assuming perhaps the right initial mathematical maturity, of which the diligent student only gains more)--though there are perhaps some symbolic idiosyncracies that are a throwback to the time of its first publication."
4,"An original, interesting and perceptive book.","At last a new angle on the strange paintings of Hieronymus Bosch. This is a well written and researched book, and seems to solve many mysteries in the artist's work."
3,A so-so book.,"Celebrating the Feasts with family is a noble endeavor.I feel that this book has merit on that idea alone.However,celebrating Sunday as a weekly Sabbath is incorrect.The Sabbath from a Scriptural standpoint has always been the Seventh Day.The passage that the author uses does not reveal the day of Christ's resurrection.I noticed that Mrs. Zimmerman used the NASB for most of her Scripture quotes.She also used the New Berkely Version.A lot of authors use the NIV.Mrs. Zimmerman is to be commended for her choice of Bibles used."
2,The original was better,"As a fan of the Galdone version of 1977, I found this retelling unappealing. It's far too wordy - the sparse text of the 1977 version is better suited to sustaining a spooky mood. The beast is too visible (the imagination makes better monsters). I suppose some people need a happy ending to everything, but I prefer to leave my listeners with an unsettled feeling. Before you purchase this version, seek out the earlier one and make an informed decision."
5,Great Kitchen tool,"I've used many types of scrapers over the years and this is simply the best one on the market. There's not much more I can say about this scraper than all the other rave reviews out there. I just wanted to confirm that this tool is exactly what I was looking for in a utilitarian spatula/scraper. After a few uses, I am 100% sure that this thing will last me for years to come. I am so sure, in fact, that I am getting the larger (13 1/2 inch) version for large batch cooking."
4,one bigarse spoon!,"I bought this by accident; was 'aiming for' the equivalent scraper, didn't zoom in on the picture and bought the spoon version by accident.I was going to return it but treating it as a 'happy accident' because it will be the PERFECT utencil for stirring my chili and getting all that wonderful fond mixed in!4 vs 5 stars because rather than having some internal structure to make the 'spoon' shape have strength they just designed it super super thick making the spoon side quite heavy; it's like a rubber mallet with a dent on one side to make a spoon!this thing is desgned to be used in a commercial environment, scraping out a 5-gallon size mixer etc. it will be comfortable in pots bigger than 6qt and oversized on smaller pots.-awr"
5,rachael ray,"now i feel like rachael ray been looking for a spoonula for a while this is great!!! stirs and flips food, dont know how i lived without it,"
4,"Beautiful, really.","I ordered these awhile back mostly for the buttons up the side and was thus surprised by the height. I don't regret the purchase at all, but I can't wear them very often because they hurt my feet. I'm not used to wearing heels very often, but as I said these boots are awesome.The toes do scuff fairly easily (I got the black polyurethane ones), but the rest of the boot seems fairly tough. Zipping them up is a bit of a chore, especially the right one, though it has gotten much easier after some wear."
5,Sexy and comfortable,I purchased these to go with a halloween costume and they were perfect. They were surprisingly very comfortable as well so they will be getting more wear that I had originally planned.
3,Cute boots but they stay in the closet,"One boot seemed to fit a bit tighter than the other and after extended periods of time, they do tend to hurt the feet. Amazingly enough, they aren't horrible to walk in, tho. I don't wear these much, because where really can you? Church? The office when you're on the go all the time? They're amazing boots if you're the one looking, not the one wearing. :)"
3,Think Huge,"Everything is big - big people, big things, big talk, and big appetite. Maggie has her own column. She doesn't believe in diets and she writes about it. She is not obese, just big. She gives talks, appears on TV, and she enjoys what she does especially the eating part. Each chapter consists of the story about Maggie and a copy of her article. Leading a fast moving life in New York City, she is a confident woman. Until a call from a movie actor, she truly believes that it is liberating to enjoy life being a size sixteen. She receives a consultant proposition and starts thinking about losing weight for the first time in her life. But, she has to keep it a secret. The many mentions of food and drinks in the book are mouthwatering even if the narration is chaotic and not that interesting."
4,A guilty pleasure.,"An anti-diet columnist for a big NY newspaper is invited to Hollywood as a consultant to a hot actor for his latest movie role as a diet doctor. Of course, she can't meet the hunk without losing a few pounds first. She embarks on a major makeover and diet plan and learns a lot about herself, her readers, and her life in the process.The writing was fast paced and funny, with a self-deprecating protagonist. Blumenthal's writing style is similar to that of Lorna Landvik (Angry Housewives Eating BonBons). I enjoyed this book and would read more from this author."
2,well it looked good on the cover,"there was just something a little off about this book. A little spacey. For example, there's a part where the main character decides to give her assistant a camera. Then boom, the assistant has the camera and has pictures published.I kept feeling like there were paragraphs missing from pages or something."
2,Not so good,"I bought this book because I thought the premise sounded interesting. Turns out, it wasn't so great. The heroine, Maggie, is a life-long dieter who has finally accepted her weight and writes a famous column helping others to do the same. So her losing weight quickly and even having a cosmetic procedure seemed very unrealistic-even with the great motivation of meeting a gorgeous Hollywood hunk. Also, the book started too slowly. I almost gave up on it. It took about 100 pages for Maggie to finally get to Hollywood to meet the hunk, and then it was a letdown when she got there. I expected a grand romance, but it was just a fling, although the author did portray the actor as a pretty nice man. The story's theme of ""sometimes what you're looking for is right under your nose"" was kind of sweet, but not enough to make me recommend this book to friends. Maybe it's just me, but I also didn't like the author's writing style."
2,Disappointing Drivel,"This book was really rather tedious to get through. The heroine's insights are unoriginal, her exploits are impossible to believe (even for fiction), and the literary style offered confusing transitions between events. The characters are poorly developed and the plotline is stale. I'm very upset that someone could compare this wearisome and blatantly copied story to Jemima J, a clearly superior tale. The only saving grace for the novel is the author's advice about safe weightloss and the call for self-acceptance at any size. It would have been ever better if the heroine actually followed that instead of falling into the same old sequence of events as all stories featuring ""fat"" women employ: woman is fat, woman meets/will meet handsome man, woman loses weight to get the man. It really is a shame; I had such high hopes for this book. So would I recommend this book? Yeah, but don't buy it. See if your library has a copy."
1,Don't bother buying,"The plot had potential but it just fizzled out on page 2. If you feel like you have to read it, go to the library and get it and you'll be glad you didn't buy it."
3,Cute but predictable,I thought the back of the book made it sound really interesting as I am a big fan of chick lit and weightloss. (Fave Book: Jemima J by Jane Green) I have to admit that it really took me a while to get into the book. I did enjoy most of the book such as the main characters quick wit and friends but I also found the book TOO PREDICTABLE.Overall it is more of a book to borrow from the library than actually purchase.
4,A Great Debut Novel!!!!,"This book wouldn't have ordinarily appealed to me, but a friend recommended it and so I took a chance. I'm very glad I did. The main character, Maggie O'Leary is an over weight columnist who gets her chance at ""winning the man"" and getting thin in the process. The writing was great, if the story lacked a bit in depth. But I think what kept me hooked was the age old ""dieter's plight"" that so many women (and men) can relate to. This is definitely a chick lit book, but one well worth it."
2,Reads like a menu...,"I rarely put down a chick-lit book halfway through, but this book was just unbearable. I understand that Maggie likes food and everything, but the menu-like descriptions were just too much! This got dropped after about 100 pages...I just couldn't take it!"
1,Couldn't finish this book!,"This book was not what I expected. The story sounded great, but the author's style of writing was so horrible I could not stand to read past the 5th chapter. It was often hard to figure out which characters were speaking. The main character was believable for the first few chapters, but it made no sense for her to suddenly change so much as to start a diet over a movie star. And the use of CAPS got really annoying after about 3 pages. Don't waste your time."
1,Uninterested,"The premise of the book was pretty entertaining, but that's about it. I had to force myself through the first 100 pages. I just didn't care what happened. The writing style left me unamused and bored. I didn't connect with the character, nor found her very believable (one perhaps leading to the other). I felt the story to be underdeveloped, as if I was reading the first or second write attempt. Shame. Not recommended."
3,"""It's okay""","That's what the 3 stars choice said when I moused over it ;-)As an overweight woman, a story about an overweight woman who gets the guy is intriguing. And that's how this book appeared on the surface. Funny, intriguing, etc. However, once I got ""into it"", Fat Chance just wasn't that great. There were some fun portions, some that made me chuckle, but all in all....eh. If you need something to read and can't find anything else, this one will do."
4,Pretty nice,"If you're a bboy and you've been keeping up with the Scribble jam dvds you might be disappointed. It's much of the same.The bboy battles can be quite sick. There are a lot of really nice tricks and some pretty good styleheads but it comes back down to the brickheads and Motion Disorders again. Vicious germz are on the disc also and they get pretty nasty.I would recommend this one more for any emcees. An australian kid rips up the emcee battles. TheSaurus and Iron Solomon make an appearance and it gets incredibly hot on the mics.The beatbox battles are pretty weak. I think it was the first year that they had it and there were very few participants.Worth checking out if you've got extra cash, but it would be better to save up for something more worthwile, like bboy hodown."
3,Lovely Slice-of-Life Comedy,"In the tradition of THE BIRD CAGE and THE WEDDING BANQUET, this lovely little film balances the varying nuerosis of family, ethnic culture, societal pressure about marriage, and the alienation of being an ""outsider"".The episodic structure is a little reminiscent of Wes Anderson, and while some of the characters walk the tightrope between character and caricature, the story is so well told that I think most audiences will forgive the broader strokes.The dialogue has just the right comic feel and some of the dialogue, particularly between Angelo's parents, is frequently laugh-out-loud funny!Recommended!"
3,Cute...but nothing more,"Mambo Italiano does for the Italians what My Big Fat Greek Wedding did for the Greeks. Only this time, the couple is gay. Both portrayed the typical cultural stereotypes, and both came off cute but not lasting. Mambo Italiano deals with a typical Italian family living in Little Italy in Canada. When their son moves out, moves in with his lover, and then comes out to his family, all hell breaks loose. The movie tries to be a laugh a minute comedy, but the true comedy comes from Luke Kirby who does an outstanding job. He is the only character with real comedy and emotion, and he lights up the screen in all his scenes. It is easy to see why he was cast in the lead. Mambo Italiano isn't a movie that inspires, but it's perfect after a long day after work to just sit back, relax, and enjoy a few chuckles."
5,mambo italiano,Very cute movie funny sad and coping with gay issues . Was funny to watch glad I own it ~ you will be hapy to see this film .
5,Brilliantly funny!,"Frst of all, this is NOT My Big Fat Greek Wedding in an Italian context. It's much more about the hilarious consequences of two men coming out of the closet much to the consternation (and conservatism) of everyone else around them. I would rate this move as good as MBFGW. The script is incredibly intelligent and in fact it is precisely the script that carries this movie, not the actors."
4,Existed before My Big Fat Greek Wedding!,"I loved this movie. People say the acting by Angelo's parents (Paul Sorvino and quebecoise Ginette Reno) over the top. Sorry people it wasn't, it was right on the money. I have italian friends whose parents are very similar. Another thing people don't realize was that Mambo Italiano started as a play here in Montreal (where co-writer Steve Galluccio is from). It was on stage before My Big Fat Greek Wedding was made. Not that Wedding isn't good, it's also a CANADIAN MOVIE.Mambo is based loosely on Steve Galluccio's life growing up in Little Italy Montreal. I never saw it on stage but waited impatiently for the movie to come out. One of my favorite scenes is also when Angelo is set up by his parents, and he proceeds to belittle them for making him ashamed to be who he is. All in all great movie."
5,Funny! I can relate to this story.,Very funny movie. Its also heart warming.It worth owning and makes a nice party movie (even in mixed company).
4,My Big Fat Greek Wedding for Gay Italians : ),"Mambo Italiano was very reminiscent of My Big Fat Greek Wedding, in a good way. It has very lovable, quirky, and humorous, yet flawed supporting characters--much in the same way of Greek Wedding, and also really played off of the cultural expectations of its characters. Mambo is able to do what few gay movies choose to do: get a point across in a humorous, light-hearted, genuine way. You care about the main characters and relate to them. It definitely has an agenda (which is not necessarily a bad thing) and focuses on the difficulty of coming out to family, friends, and self (which is overdone in gay cinema), but manages not to be over-powering, and can, at times, even be a little too much fluff. Overall, though, it is a great, fun movie, if you simply want to be light hearted, enjoy a cute, lovable movie with your boy on a couch eating popcorn and snuggling on a rainy afternoon."
4,"It's a comedy, lighten up!","This movie is, above all, a comedy. The issues of being gay, being in the closet, coming out to family and facing judgment and rejection -- very real issues that gays face -- are present, but couched in fun, silly terms -- which worked for me, actually. The characters were caricatures in many cases -- deliberately so -- which also worked for me. Again, this is a COMEDY, and like Greek Wedding, the plot and characterization were embellished for laughs. Very well done!"
4,A gay romantic comedy,"I haven't laughed so much at a movie for so long until I watched Mambo Italiano. It is a comedy with a message on 'coming out'. Definitely, a movie to own that will brighten up your day."
3,Good but not great,This was an entertaining film that was moderate. I did not make a connection with the story because it failed to draw me in and the lead figure was warm but not engaging. The leads lover ( Nino) was engaging and charming. The story was slow and did not have an emotional impact. Not a great investment but worthy of a look.
2,Pass On This Film,"There is noting like a a tragic comedy--and this is nothing like one. This movie lacked sincerity and by failing to successfully exploit the scripts emotional depths we are left with a movie which is more like Airplane 3 than Torch Song Trilogy, or more like Police Academy 4 than Parting Glances. The actors were likable but the director was willing to take few risks, leaving us with a series of chuckles rather than the emotional roller coaster the movie could have been. This gets two stars because this movie is based upon a well crafted script but the execution was poor. Disappointing."
3,"Where did the Big, Fat and Happy go?",Most of the film was enjoyable. The family was a bit over the top but I guess that most interesting families are over the top. I wish that I would've experienced a deeper investment in the non-Italian charachter. This could have balanced the greater disappointment.I saw this movie over 9 months ago and I still become sad when I reflect upon it.
3,Nice gay movie,"Mambo is a cute movie. It's not great, somewhat uninteresting, and the worst part is it isnt really funny. The subject matter is the best part of the movie."
5,funny and creative,"If you like a good and intelligent comedy, you've got it. It reminds the ""Greek Wedding"". The acting is delightful. The scene between Sorvino (the father) and Reno (the mother) deciding whether to go to a wedding or not is marvelously funny. It's a comedy to be seen over and over again."
1,Poor quality,"Item description says ""tough premium shippers"" - they are far from that. The quality is very poor - these are the worst bubble mailers I've ever encountered and I've shipped thousands of packages in bubble mailers. The comment, ""sturdily built with bubble lined wall construction for extra protection during transit"" is a mis-representation. These mailers provide no protection and they are shipped in equally weak boxes that were broken open and clearly marked ""Made in China"". I can return them, but the shipping cost I'd have to pay is more than I'd get refunded. Instead of ""upgrading my company image"" as the description boasts, if I were to use these cheap bubble mailers, I'd have customers receiving broken products and hurting my image and reputation as a professional and reputable business. The only good thing about these is I can put them in the recycle bin and the recycling company can take them off my hands. Money down the drain."
4,"Was thinking it was too cheap to be good, but I was wrong","I bought these thinking something this cheap would be of little use, but I had to take the chance.The glue / sealant used on both the inside bubble wrap and the edging provide a sturdy mailer. The dimensions inside are just enough to get a CD case to fix snugly. A DVD case would not fit, but this is not the size requirements for that.A four is provided as the bubble wrap inside is a bit ""thin"", but one can always add more bubble wrap themselves. Also, the shipping a bit delayed, but nothing to get upset about. Overall, very happy and I will buy again when I need more."
1,Worthless,"These envelopes were the correct size, and the paper looks and feels good, but if you're wanting a bubble mailer, do not get these. They work as a plain manila envelope, but the ""bubbles"" are nearly all deflated and provide absolutely NO padding for the envelope contents. When I gently pinch the bubbles with one finger on the outside of the package and one on the inside, my fingertips touch. Bottom line - don't ship anything fragile in these mailers!"
4,Cute little book,"This is a cute little book, Love the african poems and proverbs. I really enjoyed it and will be sharing it with some others. ."
3,africa love poems,"They're refreshing to the ear! I enjoyed them so much I read them to a friend, she liked them as well."
5,"Solid, Easy to install","No problems installing this wall mount. Easy for 1 person, provided you can lift your TV by yourself.If you buy the ""security"" model, don't lose the Allen Wrench!"
3,cancellation review,"This item was ordered, however, within hours it was cancelled. The cancellation did not reach supplier in time so item was shipped. The item was not accepted, but returned. The supplier has to this moment not provided refund, however, he has promissed to do so in due time. We shall see."
4,Beyond the songs,"As a fan of the music I really enjoyed Piece by Piece, but when I purchased it I did expect it to go a little deeper into her life than it did. Instead we got to understand her musical process, learn about how the music industry works and most interestingly, the story behind some of the songs.While I would have liked to learn a little more about her life, this book gives a deeper appreciation of the music she writes and allows the reader to understand the musical genius she really is."
2,sadly dissapointed,"I was very excited to read this book! I ran home, got comforable and started reading. I found myself skipping through the pages. I found it was very myth based, and too much about religion and Jesus and mary. I bought it because I love Tori and have been fascinated by her. I wish this book was more about her life, her childhood. I have read less then half this book,and I will either force myself to finish, or return the book. I really am sadly dissapointed. Tori is the singer and song writer that you can listen to over and over again. I have bought her CD's 3 and 4 times each because I listened too much and the CD was worn. I really don't suggest anyone to buy this, you will be let down, just as i was."
5,about the book,"Drawing on his many years as a pastor, as well as a national church leader and staff member for evangelism, Clinton Marsh confronts head-on the declining membership of the mainline Protestant churches with this biblical and practical book on growing the church into the twenty-first century. Marsh contends that the congregation is at the heart of evangelism. Every activity in a congregation's life proclaims the gospel. Affirming the work of the Holy Spirit, and using the teaching of Jesus as a model, Marsh advocates an approach to evangelism driven by love. Marsh offers practical suggestions and deals with the ""motive, the message, and the method"" of evangelism in a clear and useful manner. This is a book for lay leaders, pastors, study groups, and church boards."
4,Great!,"Possibly my favorite of this band's releases so far... somehow the songs seem more tuneful and better organized around a theme than those on previous DK CDs. In fact, a few, like ""Doctor Money"" are downright catchy. But don't get me wrong, the band maintains it's signature moodiness throughout; tense guitar crunch giving way to smooth, almost ambient passages of ethereal keyboards and plinking strings. This is instrumental prog rock at its most expressive."
4,Almost excellent!,"What's a great surprise! I bought it 4 weeks ago, and since then I've listened it 6 or 7 times, and each time I find something new on it!This CD consists of two albums. The first one (track 1-5) is muscular instrumental space rock. I'm not a big fan of this genre, but those guys know how to play non-boring and creative all-instrumental rock!The second album (tracks 6-11) is more calm, spacey, almost new age-like, but it is also very well done!This is my very first Djam Karet CD, and it encouraged me to explore their back catalog."
2,"Stones and Bones of New England: A guide to the unusual, historic, and otherwise notable Cemeteries","This book had promise, but it never lived up to it. It probably gives a comprehensive review of the cemeteries available for viewing and hints on where to park, but the actual cemetery information is scarce. Sometimes it will talk about a special monument and there is no picture. It left me wanting more."
3,Get directions first,"Although this book is great for giving histories for graveyards and unusual individuals, beware. Get directions to these locations first. If you follow the book's directions, most times you will get lost for hours. Some of the roads in the book's directions do not even exist, others will lead you to an area miles away from the actual graveyard. It is my opinion that the author has not visited most of these locations, and is only speculating to their whereabouts."
1,DOES NOT INCLUDE DOLLS!!!,"I just want to warn everybody that this is just a fashion gift set. It does not come with any dolls! The title/description do nothing to imply this.Please complain to Amazon. If enough people do than maybe they'll take measures to prevent moronic titles like ""barbie new england escape"" that accompany items that don't represent what is being sold."
4,Very Satisfied,This wobble board has helped tremendously in rehabilitating my injured ankle & recovering my sense of balance.
2,Too Much Tea,"I like cozy, light hearted little mysteries like this, enjoyed it even though the writing style tends to be naive (for want of a better word) And the tea? 'Way too much tea-this and tea-that.Conversations between the characters were repetetive. The mystery itself contrived. However, I did find the characters likeable and the food she described kept making me hungry.....(I'm going to try that scone recipe at the end of the book.)I also liked her description of Emily Guthro's house.So I'm giving it two stars instead of one."
2,THIS ENTRY IS A DISAPPOINTMENT,"These ""Tea Shop"" Mysteries are good books. Ms. Childs fleshes out her characters nicely and provides an always intriguing plot. However, her latest entry is a huge disappointment.As I was reading,I suddenly realized that 90% of Chapter 5 is all about tea, tea infusion, tea flavors, where tea is grown, and about setting up for one of Theodosia's soirees! The story line seems to have been forgotten for the duration.By the time I got to Chapter 6, I'd forgotten the basic plot! I enjoy a little information about the ""tea"" subject, but the emphasis is on ""LITTLE""!This extraneous information, however nice, is distracting and annoying. Enough, already! Surely this fine author can do better!"
1,Never Got to Peruse it!,Unfortunately the company I ordered it from never sent it therefore I can't say I enjoyed reading it. All I can say is be more aware of who you order the books from.
4,Mary Timony's final work as Helium,"Mary Timony's final work as Helium, produced by Mitch Easter, is a really nice effort with lots of different instruments and production. This sounds somewhat eletronica influenced, but nowhere nearly as repetitive and boring as that genre; and it rocks. Some of the songs on this are quite brilliant. As a member of the 2001 band Wild Flag, Mary will get the due she deserves."
4,Another excellent effort from these pop wonders,"Helium's melodic, moody sound doesn't disappoint on this release. The meandering subject matter, from dragons and so on, makes the record an even more unique thrill. Helium makes the sort of chilled-out music that almost anyone can appreciate."
2,magic city cd,"this review is for the band helium with mary timony, who i love but not so much this album, it's all right, but not great."
1,Expensive and if you are more than an Anthro 101 Student don't bother!,Very dissapointed! It's very expensive and the information in the book is so generalized you would have better luck looking it up on Wiki. There are several important concepts completely missing as well as famous therorists.
1,Don't bother,"This dictionary is just another long-winded, pretentious, unreadable, high-brow attempt to legitimize anthropology. The authors of each definition are more concerned with impressing their peers than giving the average person clear insight to cultural anthropology. If you are struggling through a cultural anthropology class, and are looking for a dictionary with clear definitions, forget this book."
1,"Whew, too many mistakes!!","I ran into so many mistakes that I stopped reading after the third chapter. Wow. What happened? An OFDM beginner has little chance to learn from this book. SAMS should be ashamed.\The MATLAB code doesn't even run. No SAMS books for me, ever again."
5,One shot,"If you are looking for one shot at implementing the OFDM reciever / transmitter, just get it form Dr Heiskala. The code of the book, is the only code on the web todate that gives u an OFDM system for free. Without a penny asked."
1,Incredible Mathematics,"I cannot understand how this book can get reviews with more than 1 star given the number of mathematical errors it contains.Ok, it IS a nice intro. But do not rely on the formulas !"
5,A great book on OFDM WLANs,This is by far the best book on the topic that I have read. The book is perfect for someone who has a very strong CS background but is interested in understanding physical layer issues.
5,An excellent book to understand OFDM system,I think this book is an excellent book to understand OFDM WLANs. It goes through the main topics in a nice and organized way and mention all what you want. Also it provides lots of equations as well as figures to help understanding. I really recommend this book if you are interested to learn about WLAN system based on OFDM.
3,"""LEO MARINI- EXITOS DEL ROMANTICO DE SIEMPRE""","Leo Batet Vitali, aka ""Leo Marini"", his artistic name, the great ""bolerista"" from Mendoza, Argentina, brings us more of his classic hits in this great album. Being from Argentina, Leo could've been an interpreter of the native ""Tango"" but instead chose the cuban created bolero and for decades remained a favorite of latin audiences everywhere, simply delighting them with his suave style and melodius voice.An outstanding tune in this CD is the great old time bolero, ""Que Me Has Dado Tu"", my favorite song in this compilation, also all time classics like Osvaldo Farres, ""Acercate Mas"", Rafael Hernandez, ""Lamento Borincano"", Sergio de Karlo's ""Flores Negras"" and others make this album an irrisistible must have. Leo Marini is now in God's care, but thanks to his extensive recorded repertoire his voice is and will always be with us. I strongly recommend this CD."
1,What happened?,"First there was Futurama and what a joy the first four seasons were. Funny, edgy and weird the stories were fun to watch and provided at least a couple of laughs per show. Then it went off the air. Then it came back with the ""Futurama movies"" and they were very disappointing. Then came season five and it was even worse than the movies. So I ask, ""what happened""? Did the writers give up or figure they can get away with just writing crap and no one will care? I don't know but I won't be adding this DVD to my collection and I won't even bother to watch next season's show. Futurama, so long, we hardly know ye."
1,money talk....,"I do watch animation and stop normally after first 5 minutes; yes, i consider animation an art and expect producers understand what art is about and in this case art is about money not art. I value imagination as part of art and see complete lack of any in all Futurama series. And as I said before my benchmark is Bakshi and its about time somebody produce animation worth mentioning.No luck."
4,"Love the Product, Hate the Packaging","Love this show. The episodes are awesome along with the extras. But I hate the packaging. The cardboard sleeves scratched the hell out of my Futurama DVD movies, and I know the same will happen with the two discs in Vol 5. I'm all for being ""Green"" and Eco-Friendly, but can't they have it be cardboard with a recycled plastic holder insert or something? I'm so sad the fate that is beheld to my beloved DVD collection."
1,Don't download as of 2012,"This season 5 download is actually Season 4. Season five starts off with ""rebirth"" where season 4 ends with ""The Devil's Hands are Idle Playthings."" So don't download this mistaken season 5, if you already own season 4. Just a warning until I can contact amazon about this problem. Which is weird because season 4 is the last produced by FOX where comedy central picked up season 5 after many years in syndication. How one could make such a mistake, I have no idea. But, like I said, you've been warned."
5,Great continuation of the series,These episodes continue bringing the high quality that made the show so great. A must have for all Futurama fans.
3,"Good, not great","I was really looking forward to the latest instalment of Futurama, having already purchased all of the previous releases. While I'd rate this series as a return to form after the hit-and-miss extended length episodes, I'd have to say that it's good but not great. I got a few laughs out of most of the episodes, but found that they didn't really grab me the way earlier series did. I don't know if this is because they're running out of steam, or my tastes have changed, or the reputation of the earlier series just makes it hard for anything new to measure up. Having said that, if you're a fan of the show and you've got a few bucks spare, I'd give it a go. It's a bit like The Simpsons- even their 'lesser' episodes are still better than a lot of other shows out there."
3,Cardboard slip packaging is crappy,"I hate the packaging for this because its cardboard slide ins and the discs will get ruined very easily with each slide in and out. I wish the packaging had plastic holder at least, I mean come on all the previous ones had way better holders and packaging.They got too lazy on this one in my opinion both on the packaging and also the show. The shows comedy seems to be slipping up a bit compared to earlier episodes. Other than that my biggest dislike is the packaging and harder to keep discs from getting ruined. I will not re purchase this item just because the discs got ruined like the company probably hopes for. If I knew they were packaged like this I wouldn't have even bought it to begin with.If you don't mind the packaging, then enjoy the show!!"
2,Futurama: Volume Five,"I'm a huge fan of Futurama and I'm super happy that it came back, no need to review the series here. I've got the previous series boxset which is an awesome package.Unfortunately the packaging for this season is lacking in quality. Everything is made of flimsy single layer cardboard. The inside is just two sleeves for the DVD's to sit in.I miss the old plastic dual cases."
5,Futurama Season 5 Does Not Disappoint!,"Season 5 is a very good season overall. The first couple episodes are great. All your favorites are back, and not just the main characters... Kif, Zapp Brannigan, Earth President Nixon (head), Elzar, etc... Besides the funny episodes we've come to expect Season 5 also gives us a couple of emotional roller-coasters too- while not quiet as sad as the fate given to Fry's dog in earlier seasons (later fixed in the first movie-Futurama - Bender's Big Score) you might shed a tear on the episode about Bender's birth or the Time Travel episode where Fry gets stuck in the future (again.. I guess.) Without giving away too much if for some reason you couldn't see this season when it aired on Comedy Central you will NOT be disappointed by this release. ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD!"
4,pretty good,This season is just as fun to watch as any of the later movies or seasons.I bought this show later than the other ones because I don't usually buy a tv show that is still on the air.
3,futurama season 5 review,The box was damaged in the mail due to very poor packaging (just wraped in one layer of paper). That was pretty dissapointing.
3,Love Futurama but...,I have always loved Futurama but 13 episodes I know that is all they had for the season but come on. The show retains some of its humor but almost like they are trying to hard. I hope that by the next season they get back to the old 3rd and 4th season's humor and then I'll be back in love.
5,AMAZING SHOW,"The best of Futurama all in one CD package.If you love Futurama, add this to your collection today.Get all of the Seasons sets"
5,"Not the Best eppisodes, but its still futurama","Its futurama, how couldnt you love it. honestly I would buy anything futurama as long as its on blu-ray. I wish they would remaster the old collections on blu-ray"
4,will someone make this guy a star already?,"It's a pity, because in a perfect world Tommy Keene's power pop would have propelled him to superstar status by now. But alas, because he favors straight ahead melodies and minumum trappings, he has fallen by the wayside more than a few times. Still, this album offers of what I mentioned above--and of course, the melancholic adult viewpoint we have known him for all these years, plus his weedy, though not unpleasant tenor that colours each of these tracks with the full bodied emotion they deserve and which a less interested perfomer would screw up. There's a resemblance to Gin Blossoms (who have cited him as an influence and did tour together). Songs such as the reflective ""If You're Getting Married Tonight"", the jet propelled rock of ""Turning On Blue"", prove that there are more than several ways to ""power pop"". If Matthew Sweet is the prince of power pop, then Tommy Keene is its overlooked king."
3,ok,"This book features a circus type animal on each page, and a word that describes the animal that starts with the same letter as the animal name. Animals that are included are Mellow Monkeys, playful pigs silly seals and many more. At the top of each page is the letter, formed by acrobats.We felt that some of the words that described the animals were a little hard for the picture book crowd to try and grasp.This would be a nice book to share with little ones who are learning their letters and like animals!"
4,Worthy!,"This single is four songs and about 8 or 9 minutes long. The Official Ironmen Rally Song is probably the first song released where GBV used a ""real"" studio, with ""real"" producers, yet one of the last with the ""classic lineup"" of musicians. 'The Official Ironman Rally Song' and 'June Salutes You' are very excellent tracks. 'Why Did You Land' is worthy of release from Bob Pollards suitcase of four track tapes also. Some of these songs have that really lo-fi feel that Alien Lanes and Bee Thousand had, even though the 'Under The Bushes, Under The Stars' lp, that was released around this time,(1996) had more studio finish to it. There are so many great b-sides to the mid 90s Guided By Voices singles and eps like 'I Am a Scientist', 'Sunfish Holy Breakfast' 'The Grand Hour' and 'Get Out Of My Stations'. The Guided By Voices Box set has a disc of great b-sides."
4,Pop masters,"This is a band that has found its niche in short, catchy pop/rock bursts. ""Life"" follows its predecessors admirably, albiet with a stronger emphasis on the Marc Bolan vocal stylings, that work very well. The single, ""Grace"" would have been a classic TRex song. ""Za"", the opener has a catchy piano backbone that rocks. ""Seen the Light"" continues the fun these boys bring to their music. Other highlights, ""Evening of the Day"" and ""Can't Get Up"". Overall, the album is short but chock full of great songs. This won't be the breakthrough album these guys deserve but it does continue and move forward their portfolio of great rock records."
2,let down,"Willing to give it some more time but this record is a big let down. It's still Supergrass so there are lots of great vocals and band personality but the songs are largely insignifigant. Where is the weight?""Prophet 15"" and ""Run"" are all that keeps me from smashing this thing over my head and into one hundred bits. Run is a top 15 Supergrass song but low on that list. Prophet 15 would have made a nice b-side surprise. Something is rotten here.I saw it coming when the last album was dominated by weak material but I did not want to believe that it could happen.The last album has some gems though that more than save it and seperated Supergrass as one of the true musical leaders of this pale generation.Why could this not have continued?Let down. Who is next to fall?"
1,DOES NOT FIT IS300,"Amazon said this product would fit on an is300 IT DOES NOT!! wasted my money and time for trusting them, after my friendly shop attempted multiple times they were not able to fit the wire harness on the is300. Just hope no one doesnt waste their time like i did...."
2,cute but had holes,These are cute but really low quality. SUper thin and one cup just plain had a hole in the bottom and leaked.
2,Disappointing...,"I am a Rachel Cusk fan and thought The Country Life a masterpiece. But I cannot see why this novel was so exclaimed over. The main character, in whose voice the novel is told, never comes into focus, and she is dreary company, her problems quotidian. The novel has no discernable plot and it is hard to tell one scene from another. Reading this is like being trapped inside the head of someone you would duck into a hallway to avoid having to talk to in real life."
4,Pick it up today,"Reminiscent of The Diary of Bridget Jones, but more sophisticated, yet still comedic. You will laugh out loud and ponder adult life in the same breath. The humor is wry, the author brilliant. It is not surprising that Cusk won the Whitbread First Novel Award; her prose shines. Read it."
2,Talent left on the table,"I agree with the reader from Atlanta. There's a lot of promise here, and Cusk has occasionally brilliant observations (for instance, her description of the days of the workweek). But the prose overall is convoluted and difficult to read, and there is not enough to like in any of the characters to stick with it for 200+ pages. (Actually my copy had about 40 pages printed twice, missing another 40 or so--but I don't think those 40 were any different, and I was skimming by then.)"
2,It's not Bridget Jones,"Although this is an OK book, it is nothing like Bridget Jones except that both characters work in London publishing houses. There are one or two interesting side characters (Greta's pretty good), but Agnes is just whiney and self centered without much humour. The author seems more concerned with pretty sentence structure than plot."
3,Worth reading. . .,"I read the book all the way through in one day, and I liked it. I like books about young people fresh out of college confronting the working world. A few pages into the book I was reminded of Jane Austen whom I had just recently reread; I was reminded of how certain of Jane Austen's prose can be unwieldy and take some minutes to comprehend (or not). It's unusual these days for prose construction to be so logical and complex. I derived a purely intellectual pleasure from reading that kind of prose. I partly attribute the prose style to the author being British. I just can't see an American writing in this way. I liked the fact that the book did not depend on plot. (Sometimes, I wish plot could be thrown out the window.) The conclusion tries too much to be conclusive, but it doesn't really get in the way of enjoying the book."
2,I see you and raise you ...,"I agree with most of the musings above about the beautiful writing but the convoluted plot. Part of the problem was the transitions between the detailed flashbacks of her old relationship and her vague, distantly drawn present one. I understand as a writer why she chose to be deliberately vague about the new one but it felt too much like a literary conceit at the expense of clarity, which made me bristle.However, the dealbreaker for me was the glossing over of a rape sub-plot. It's introduced merely to give Agnes YET another epiphany laden journey through London and then is handled in the final pages with an infuriating off hand comment that the rape having done this character a favor.I don't want to be a knee-jerk American and demand a cathartic revenge laden handling of the rape, but then again, there's got to be a happy medium between that and blithely brushing it off.Very disappointing."
2,If It Wasn't For The Book Club...,"I became acquainted with this novel because it was chosen by my book club.I am severly torn as to whether I should continue to read it, however, because I am finding it boring as hell. Yes, the writing is lovely, and was one of the first things that struck me when I began reading. I think that I am just bored to tears by people who do not like themselves or much else in their lives. I find it annoying. If it were not for my book club meeting in a week, I would surely chuck it."
3,Poor value for the price,I bought these for my hubby's birthday in April. We did not begin to use them til June and the bottoms are now falling apart. (It is now the end of July).
3,Not to scale,Unless dick van dyke is 9ft tall this model is no where near the advertised 1/18 scale. Other than that it is ok as a static display.
2,pieces break very easily,I bought this for my 41/2 year old son for Christmas and almost every piece of it has broken off. I realize it is not for playing with and should be put up on a shelf for display only. He is not a rough boy with his toys and I was very disappointed with the quality since it was not cheap. That being said he still loves it and wants to play with it all the time.
5,a dark gem,"after eleven:eleven and don't ask, don't tell, come deals with the loss of its rhythm section with a gorgeous, savage little record. the songs are tighter and stronger; chris sings (if sing is the word--it's a tuneful mumble, like someone in the shower one house away); the guitars crunch. high points: 'hurricane' is the highlight of the band's live set--a tour de force, as stunning lyrically as its twists and turns and sudden calm eye are sonically. 'bitten' updates 'yr reign' but rides harder, with trumpets shouting the end--a marvelous piece, beautifully produced. and closing a fine group of eight songs is 'sloe-eyed,' which takes 'german song' and slows it down."
4,"Excellent WLAN card, Poor documentation",I tried to use the WiFi card in my PDA in some major airports. The card picked up the available signals wonderfully. Unfortunately the Free Public Access Points were not available either in the Chicago or in the Denver airports. So my hopes to download emails or use Skype to call were not fulfilled.At home with my own WiFi network the 802.11b has all the speed my PDA will ever need.The card does not come with the necessary amount of information about how to setup your wireless security for your PDA. I needed to find it from other sources before I got it work.
4,Not bad...,"After upgrading to PPC2003, I was able to easily install the (included) driver and connect wirelessly to the internet with my iPAQ3955 (note that the driver will NOT work with PPC2002). It can be a little buggy when initially connecting to networks, but otherwise works well. Signal strength was better than expected. Definitely worth the small price tag!"
5,Stumbled on this while seeking sacred music - what a treasure!,"This is a beautifully performed and well-recorded set. The music is intensely sacred, but descends weightlessly upon the listener.The chorus is balanced and wonderfully adept at expressing nuance without calling attention to themselves. Whether you're aim is to enhance contemplative prayer and worship time or just to enjoy the sublimity of these pieces, you'll be glad you downloaded."
3,LAST 50 PAGES WAS GOOD,This book was o.k. if the whole book was wrote like the last fifty pages then this would have been a great book.The book is about three friendsThe book takes us on a ride about their love lifesone is a dog the other got hurt alot by womenand the other is becoming in to his ownnot a bad plot but this story has been done so many timesthat it gets boringthe best part about the book is the endborrow it not a must buy!
3,Good book!,"The only reason I gave this book 3 stars instead of 4 was because of the grammatical and spelling errors. Other than that, I thought this was a really good book, told from a male point of view. I felt like I received great insight into the way men think and why they do the things they do. I would like to have known a little more background on the characters, like what did Nate do for a living?? Why did Nina act the way she did? I was a little surprised by the ending, good plot twist."
3,Straight Dogs,"This book just flabergasted me on how men possibly think. I have two sons and I am going to make it my business not to let them act this way. As a Mother, a woman should be embarrassed to think her sons behaves with womanizing ways.Things got so bad in this book that it let to someone's death. I was so shocked. I do recommend this book but read it with an open mind.Later...."
2,Before I Let Go,"This book was okay if you are interested in the trash this author thinks is in the mind of every male. I realize men think about sex a lot more than females, but this book is ridiculous. Also why do so many Black authors portray married women as cheaters in there novels? A bit over the top! Fifteen year old boys would love this book!"
4,Good read,"Darren Coleman managed to keep me ticked off through the whole book at the immature behavior of his main characters. If an author can do that, he has me fully into the story. Although only one character, Nate, was labeled as a DOG, truth is, the other two, Cory and Brendan were dogs in their own way. They were deliciously self centered and selfish. Nice twist at the end. Since I also live in the Washington DC area, it was nice to recognize some of the places mentioned. Ladies - after reading this book, you'll know what kind of men to avoid if you're looking for a steady relationship. Great job for a first time author."
3,We Now Know What Men Think About!,"This book was pretty good. It gave us an insight into what really goes on in a man's head/thoughts. It showed that men and women both play games when it comes to matters of the heart. I was disappointed when Brendan destroyed his relationship with his best friend and surprised as to who he actually ended up with. Nate tried to have his cake and eat it to, and in the end it caught up with him. By the way, what did Nate do for a living??? I realize the book was told from the standpoint of Cory. However, I wanted to read more dialogue between the characters and not so much narration. There was some drama, but it was more towards the end of the book than in the beginning. However, for a first time author, he did a pretty good job."
4,Drama Loaded!,"Cory Dandridge, narrator of this novel and best friend to the other two main characters in this novel has loved and lost. His first love has haunted him during the course of his relationships and ultimately caused Cory to date some women in situations with red flags all over them!Brendan Shue is the nice guy in the bunch. He treats his women with the ultimate respect and consideration. Trouble is, most of the women he dates takes his kind hearted ways for weakness when it comes to women and takes advantage of his generosity and selflessness.Nathan McCall is a DAWG! He feels he is the ultimate PLAYER and if you tell him any different well, then you're just hating! Nate will have to come to terms with his treatment of women and the boomerang of what goes around, comes back!Awesomely loaded with the male perspective on relationships and women in general.Great job by Darren Coleman. This was my first time reading one of his novels but it will not be my last."
5,Spectacular B-Sides,"I just recently found Supergrass (I know, a little late) and man am I sure glad I did. I found my favorite band! This single includes two B-sides that I had been searching for for months. ""Tishing"" and ""That Old Song"" have become two of my favorite Supergrass B-sides. They are just as great as the LP tracks, and give you more of what a Supergrass fan craves."
4,Seems like it will be helpful.,"I bought this as an engagement present for my best friends and gave it to them the day after they got engaged. It has a great deal of content and even if they don't end up using the worksheets, it's still fun for them to look at. The book itself was a little beat up (some of the divider tabs were creased, some dents on the cover) so it might be better to buy it at a store where you can see the actual book and content first."
2,Very helpful information but...,I was very pleased with all the helpful information this wedding planner has but was very disappointed when it fell apart two days after giving it to my son's fiance as a gift. I was very embarassed to say the least. We are not returning it because she has started writing a lot of information in it so she has put it in a three-ring binder. I just want to warn other buyers about this product. I'm sure there are other books that contain just as much information as this one but won't fall apart.
1,JUST DON'T TRY LUGGING THIS AROUND...,"I am a grownup bride with some experience in event planning. I bought the ""organizer"" as a tool for this most important event. After 3 weeks of struggling to make this planner work for me, I just threw it in the trash. What a waste! The book is huge, and cumbersome. Each section is filled with useless filler pages, and the sections aren't really as any normal bride would need them! I would hate to see any bride try to lug this thing into the stationer's or flip desperately through it when the photographer returns your call!A wedding planner should HELP, not hinder. Furthermore, the book contains advertisements, which seems unfair considering the price.Advice from a very disappointed customer: don't waste your precious time and money on this product."
1,Three words Ladies: Save your Money!,"There are any reasons I decided to return this within five minutes of looking at it. First of all, it's too big. You are planning a wedding for pete's sake, not designing some new space walk module for NASA. Secondly, the advice and ""tips"" border on insulting. This planner offers such gems as ""Don't get drunk and embarrass yourself on your special day"". There's also a special section of helpful hints for your fiancé regarding his bachelor party.""Don't cheat on your fiancée at your bachelor party, it would be a bad way to start your marriage"". If some people find the tips and advice in here helpful, that would explain today's divorce rate.Do yourselves a favor, and pass on this one."
5,A Great Wedding Planner and Etiquette book all in one!!!,"This is a great wedding planner. I love the pockets, business card holders, planning worksheets, dividers, and photos. You have everything in here you need for the wedding except the groom! I would only suggest that is come with a 3-ring binder on its next publishing in order to insert my own things."
3,It's okay...,"I bought two wedding planners and this is the one that I've been using the least. It does have really good sized pockets in the divider of each section. It has gorgeous pictures in it and as the wedding date draws closer (we still have nine months), it's quite possible I'll use this one more.This book does have a business card holder and so far that's the part I've used the most."
5,Fast,I received this product very fast and my sister absolutely loves it. It was a great gift for her.
2,Too Bulky to be Useful,"The basic content of the book is good, but it's just too big and bulky. It's not portable by any means, which makes it useless if you want to do any of your planning on your lunch break or use it as a guideline to take with you when visiting reception halls, florists, etc. Skip this one and move on to something a little less cumbersome!"
4,Very Helpful,"The photographs are beautiful, and the information and worksheets are extremely helpful. Be advised, however, that this is not a purse-sized book that is easy to tote around. My only suggestion for improvement would be to take that awful Bridal Superstore section out of the back (it takes up TONS of room)and make the pockets in each section slightly bigger so that one can fit more swatches, clippings, etc inside."
4,a very nice rattle for teething babies,"Our little one liked this rattle when she was teething, and she liked to wave the beads around. We also received as gifts the Moby clutching toy and the Haba rattle with colored ""beads"" -- that one was probably the best in catching her eye with color and movement and sound, and she liked chomping on that one as well as this one. (Thank you, friends + family, for the generous gifts!) This one got play as a stroller toy clipped to plastic rings too, and that was a good distraction. All in all, Haba toys are fantastic and very nice to have."
3,Looks Cool,I really like this toy but my daughter isn't very interested in it. We got it for her when she was 6 months old. She played with it a little and chewed on it some but now that she's 10 months old she completely ignores it even when I try to get her to play with it. It is very well made and I really wish she liked it. I tend to buy this type of toy for my daughter and Grandma buys the cheap plastics ones and wouldn't you know my daughter always goes for the plastic toys.
2,Take a Pass on this one,Spread flour on the pan and it comes out the holes onto the counter. The pizza dough will stick to the pan. Hard to serve and even harder to clean. Using a cookie sheet is a much better proposition.
5,Can't beat T-Fal!!,"I had two perforated AirBake pizza pans and tried to match them. You can't beatT-Fal. These are even better than the ones I had which I was happy with. They make huge ""16"" inch pizza crusts. They have a footed bottom which I like better than the flat bottom pans. These really are great pizza pans especially if you enjoy making your own pizza."
1,Not for someone that likes good pizzeria pizza,"As hard as it is for the normal home pizza maker to make a pizza using a pan that comes out with a crispy crust, this pan makes it even harder for you. Because of the air gap that is not advertised on the outside of the box, it never gets that certain crispness many pizza lovers prefer. I left it in the oven until the top was turning brown, and the bottom never cooked the right way. Some people may like it that way, but that isn't how you get a pizza from most commercial pizzerias. Also, because of the air gap between the two thin sheets of aluminum, you have a lot of caveats to contend with when you go to wash it. Don't waste your money."
3,Hard To Clean,"Nearly impossible to clean even when pre-treating it with no-stick spray. Food gets into the holes and gets baked into it. As for cooking, it does well but it won't really brown the crust which I like, but others might not."
5,amazing...,"I was using a pizza stone and could NEVER get it make a crispy crust (Trader Joe's crusts)...I simply do not know how anyone could unless you heated up the crust before adding the sauce and other ingredients...that is not how pizzas are supposed to be made...Anyway, after much frustration, I purchased this item...and guess what....on the first try, amazing pizza with a crust that was not mush.I will never use a pizza stone to make a mushy pizza again. It makes far more sense to have holes on the bottom of your baking tray (whatever you use), to allow for air to dry the underside of the pizza...without these holes, I do not see how you can get a crispy pie...period!This is a great item and it works great...highly recommended!"
3,Pizza pan nice and works ok,"I was hoping to find a pan that would bake the bottom of the pizza so it was crunchy, but this does not. It tends to leave the bottom kind of soft even after the top of the pizza cheese is already browning.What finally worked for me was a stone; expensive, but as you heat the stone in the oven for 30 minutes before you place the pizza on it, it does crisp up the bottom of the pizza as I wanted."
4,works reasonably well,I prefer the way a pizza comes out using this pan to using a stone some of the time. The holes are small and so the bake time is longer than not using anything at all but the Airbake pan controls spillage. You will want to experiment with the temp and time for your pizza. I usually end up using a 25 degree lower temperature than recommended and extending the cooking time by 20%.It does require a vegetable oil spray to keep the pizza from sticking to the pan which is different from using a cured pizza stone. It is something I try not to forget to do.For a crispy pizza crust I don't use the AirBake or a stone and place the pizza directly on the oven rack.
5,I was pleasently surprised,"Blackout turned out to be a solid movie experience. I popped it in my DVD player, expecting low budget type quality and painful acting. To my surprise, I was glued to the TV and found myself shedding a tear or two in some parts. If you are into Sci-Fi, this movie is an urban reminiscent of the Twilight Zone's Monsters Are Due on Maple Street. That's the most I can give you without completely giving away the plot.To the reviewer who said that this movie was doing too much in too little time, I totally disagree. The acting was very engaging from the start, and very similar to the movie Crash in terms of numerous subplots with the characters. However, it was easy to follow and highly relatable, especially if you are a native New Yorker. Watch the movie!!"
4,Good movie. Definitly for New Yorkers.,"I watched this movie to see what happened to other people in New York during the blackout. My experience definitely wasn't negative. I liked this movie because it opened up my mind to what other people had went through on that day, and since I know flatbush pretty well, I could believe that all this happened. Jamie Hector is definitely an actor that people should watch out for. And if anyone is familiar with The Wire HBO series they know he is a good actor. I recommend this to anyone who lived in New York at the time of the blackout, sad that this was not a major release."
3,Unforgettable!,"This movie will burn itself onto your brain. You will never, EVER forget it. Crazy crazy B fun. The graphics of the bricked up windows are hilarious! Dude seriously get your friends together and watch this modern-day Ed Woodian feature."
3,An Alternative,"Gesulado's musical reflections for the Tenebrae service(s) held during Holy Week are one of the truly great contemplative works on the subject. That said, this recording is a second choice. The hands down master recording of this work is by the Hilliard group of more than a decade ago. Last I looked it was out of print and hard to acquire. If so, then, this recording is an excellent alternative selection.The musical reflections are not for Christians only by any means. Rather, they stand on their own (and without the translation) as music of a most extraordinary nature. It is not easy listening - not at all; the work seeks to comment on the shadows and darkening which are the coming tragedy."
2,Defective shoes,"I love the look of my Bandolino shoes, but after one wearing, I thought there was something wrong. They creaked, and a friend thought the noise came from my ankle. The second time, the noise was there again, so I brought them to a good shoemaker. He told me that he couldn't do anything, because they were defective. Can you help me? Do you have the address of the Bandolino factory so I can send them back?Waiting to hear from you,Donna Walter"
5,This Book Got Me Out of a Reading Slump,"I literally could not put this book down. I started it in the early afternoon and finished in the wee hours of the next morning. Bethany Campbell was excellent at unfolding answers to the mystery surrounding the ""adoption"" of Jaye and her brother Patrick just a little at a time -- enough to keep the reader turning paces at a frantic pace! Campbell has created a feisty heroine in Jaye whose curiosity and determination nearly get her killed. Turner is a terrific hero even though he keeps a secret which could threaten his chance of happiness with Jaye. The minor characters of the residents of the town of Cawdor, Oklahoma were chillingly well-done - their evil permeating the pages. Highly recommended!"
2,"Great idea, not so great performance","I was drawn to this book by its story line. A woman (Jaye) learns her brother has leukemia and on the same day finds out she and her brother were adopted, leading to a cross-country search for her brother's blood relatives. 5 stars for a good story line. I was pretty disappointed with the way the book was written, however. Some story lines (mainly the stories about the characters in small town Oklahoma) dragged on and were slow throughout the book. Other story lines (Jaye's search leads here cross-country) seemed to be so contrived and easily solved that they left me disappointed. All in all, there was not enough intrigue in this book for me. The ending also left me hanging-I felt like I was missing a few minor details, and that it all ended too easily. There didn't seem to be many challenges for characters in this book, but rather everything worked out perfectly."
3,Too Slow,"This was my first Campbell book. The first three chapters had me glued to the book. I thought I was in for a wild ride, however, that did not happen. The characters were vague, with the exception of Turner Gibson. His character was the only one that kept me in suspense. The rest of the chapters were very SLOW. I think Campbell could have put some more power in them instaed of chasing rabbits. I'm sure when trying to find a biological parent, it can be long and hard and very emotional, but in this novel, it was total dead ends with no spunk. I was real disappointed in the ending, one part of it was good but the other part left you completely hanging. I thought the plot about what the doctor did over thirty years ago was carried out - waaaaaaaaaaay too long. This was not a fly by your pants book. If your in the mood for something slow, this would be for you. No tissues needed, just be patient."
1,"Terrible, Horrible, and a chore to read","This book was BAD!!! I only finished reading it because I had paid to much money for it. The characters never grab your attention. The idea for this book was good, but it was not well written. It was a pain to read. I had a headache when I finished. If you want to read a good mystery buy a book written by Carlene Thompson."
2,"Good story line, but lacks substance!","The cover review drew me to the book and to what, I thought, would be ""a good read"". The storyline had good potential; but after reading the book, I thought it lacked literary substance and wondered why I had wasted my time! My daughter, who is an avid reader put it down after 100 pages. We both found the prolific use of profanity to be a distraction. Why is it necessary to convey a good story with so much profanity? The English language is so rich with descriptive words that can be better used to describe a man or woman's thoughts than to resort to gutter tripe.In all fairness, I must agree with some of the other reviewers that the story has potential for a good movie (not an Academy Award winner by any stretch), but an evening's entertainment after it comes out on video. However, Hollywood has such difficulty making movies lately that aren't punctuated with four-letter words; therefore, I would be disappointed again!"
4,Good supplemental book,"I just bought this title after having the second edition checked out from university library most of the semester. Be careful not to confuse the two: Amazon's system didn't make it clear that this was the edition being sold. Both are fine books and the first ed is a steal at the price it is commonly offered at, but the the second ed is quite a bit more concise with a second author contributing to the updated materials. This version seems to have considerably more material dedicated to applications, and would be a good additional reference to have on hand whether for introductory abstract algebra at the undergrad level or grad, or an applications course."
2,Words can't begin to explain...,"First off, let me say that I love the series and I wanted to own a little piece of it, but buying the anime was a big waste of time. I couldn't even watch the whole thing, the plot(filler), the voices, just, were too much. I'd stick with the manga. But the boxset it's self was very nice, not made out of cheap cardboard like all the others, I do like that about it. I recommend buying it episode by episode before you buy the whole season, to see if you like it first."
4,Good Entertainment,"Season 2 of Gantz all in all was good entertainment. A lot of fantastic action, full of blood and gore. What I didn't care for about this is that the first couple minutes of each episode replays the ending of the previous episode and the scenes are a bit drawn out. It reminds me of the Dragonball series. Also the ending is a bit disappointing as I was watching it I had high anticipation to see what happens. Otherwise I found this anime to be very entertaining and very colorful characters."
3,Rarities Collection should please fans,"This is not new GBV material, but rather a set of unreleased songs and two essential singles. A friend of mine, while listening to this said, ""You know, Robert Pollard's outtakes just aren't something I ever wanted to hear"", and he's got a point. Much of this is annoying little wanna be songs that don't go anywhere. Fortunately, there's ""Stabbing A Star"", a fantastic pop piece from the early 90's, ""Jabberstroker"", a neat Tobin Sprout voice/guitar piece, and ""If We Wait"", another wonderful early single that sounds like a 50's song... The rest have neat titles and little else to offer. But for the price, these three killers are worth it... For GBV fans, that is."
1,This is going to be unpopular...,"...but if you want an example of the absolute worst recording ever, this is it. Who the hell knows if this is good music when it sounds like it was recorded in a tin can? Seriously, I dig this genre in general, but the recording is absolutely so terrible and so distorted that is sounds like an LP that got chewed up by the dog. My wife commented if I was serious with this album...she thought it was a joke for how completely bad something could sound."
5,It worked 35 years ago. I hope it will help with insomnia,"I was given the album when I was expecting my first child. He has colic so bad I thought for sure he would need an operation. When I put the record on the turntable, set the low and held him to my chest. His crying eased down it didn't stop right away but it eased. I did it for two weeks and his crying periods shorten. They didn't stop but he did get some peace and so did my husband!By the time I had my second and third children it had gotten so worn out that it broke my heart to throw it away. The music and the sound of the heart beating and the uterine artery was a nerve saver, at least for me.My oldest is 35, youngest 32 and my youngest is 28 and they all benefited from that record. I wish I could get another album or cassette. My days as a caregiver can be stressful and can cause bouts of insomnia. I hope someone would make a CD or cassette for a reasonable price because I would be their first customer."
4,Fits but not under Tonneau cover...,"Bought these to go under Extand Trifecta tri-fold tonneau cover. I have rail caps and under mount bed liner and the cleats fit fine. I like that they can be mounted anywhere along the side of the rails as sometimes you need a tie down in the middle of the bed. The only problem is that if you have the Extang tri-fold they prevent the tonneau from closing properly. The cover will buldge up 1/4"" where the cleat is located, allowing water to get under the tonneau cover. Not sure if this is just an issue with the width of my tri-fold tonneau or a flaw that would happen on any of the Trifecta covers. I need to remove the cleats to close up the tonneau cover. Overall they're a good product and would probably fit under a traditional tonneau cover with the tracks on the bed rails. Just won't fit under the Trifecta series."
1,Was sent ones that weren't for the mini tower I ordered,the machine works great but was greatly dissappointed to find out that the spare filters i was offered to purchase at check out weren't even the right filters for the Holmes HA706-U True HEPA Mini Tower
3,"just ok, a bit thinner than the original Holmes filters","these arrived in a clear plastic bag (sealed) with no indication they are actual Holmes product or anyone else's product. There was no baking soda (white powder) infused into the filter like you can see in the product picture. They seem a bit thinner than the original Holmes product which I have bought many times from Walmart. Not sure they are worth the $2 savings. To return them, this vendor wants a 35% restock fee ... really??? I'll just keep them."
3,smaller than they used to be?,"I've owned a few Holmes air purifiers over the last ten years and their effectiveness is immediately evidenced by all the dust, particles and cat hair that get trapped in these carbon prefilters. However, this time around I noticed something that I'm almost positive was not the case before...the carbon prefilters do NOT entirely cover the HEPA filter. This will allow particles to enter the HEPA filter on the edges and surely decrease the useful life of the (more expensive) HEPA filters. These are GENUINE Holmes prefilters, they should NOT leave a gap around the edge of the HEPA filter. The gap isn't HUGE, but there is a gap. This is a big disappointment to me.Please see my photo under ""customer photos""."
3,Could Be Cheaper,"The actual Holmes air filter wasn't a bad price, but the HEPA and Carbon Filters are WAY expensive. There's absolutely NO reason why a couple sheets of carbon should be $14 or HEPA replacements $24 and up. A complete replacement of all 3 HEPAs and Carbon Filters will run you $200!A third party manufacturer needs to undercut these ridiculous OEM replacement prices. Replacing everything every 6 months like recommended is outrageously more expensive than the filter.That said, the Holmes HEPA filter does a great job of clearing out the air in a room. I suppose that comes with a STEEP price."
1,Conflicting item information,"The item description lists the number for the carbon filter inserts (HAPF60), but the picture shows a box for the HEPA filters.... Which one would you actually be buying here? I'm guessing the carbon filters since the price is more in line with those, but how can you trust an item listing that has conflicting information."
3,How do you rate a filter?,OK...since I was asked to do a review...what do you say about a replacement filter for an air cleaner....it works just fine!
4,Carbon Filters,Have used these filters for few years but I think its time tor replace the air purifier with one that features permanent filters. The filters work well but I'm tired of buying replacements.
5,Beautiful Stove Burner Covers,"They are a beautiful kitchen accessory, especially if fruits and vegetables are your theme. Additionally, they are sturdy and don't bend like others that I have had. You will not be disappointed."
5,A Handbook For Life,"I first found this book in a local library. I didn't rest until I had a copy of my own.It isn't the kind of book you can (should) read just once.Don't struggle with the meaning of the words, just allow them to sink into your higher mind."
2,Do not buy from this seller,It took me over 2 weeks to receive my purchase. I got an email 1 week and 1/2 after I purchased the item saying they had lost my mailing address. I didn't have my book for one of my test for college and received a poor grade do to it. I would recommend buying from this seller.
4,Musicianship + Attitude = This Album,"Delightful diversions from a band to which I've taken a special fondness. These outtakes convey the same introspective remoteness and sense of ""attitude"" indicative of the band's other works. I love the minimalist workings of the guitars, keys, and rhythm with just the right touch of noise. Listening to these two discs would make a long nighttime drive pass swiftly and pleasurably.I'm certain any fan would enjoy this set."
1,Rip off,Not worth the money. The only German Shepherd part is the picture on the cover! the DVD only talks about the history of the German Shepherd then goes into a generic training video. Title is misleading and not worth the price. The video is very short and they have included some total garbage about a playdate which is nothing more than a couple of dogs being video taped. I feel I have been duped!
4,Bought as a gift,"I bought this book for my cousin (8 years old), he loved it. It comes with a CD for the computer and he has printed off so many pictures."
4,Great for young readers.,My kids are just learning to read and love this book. It is full of colorful pictures that they enjoy studying.
3,Love DK....just not the naked picture of Venus,"I have three boys and they all love looking at the pictures and reading the interesting facts in all of the DK books. That was until I saw the naked picture of Venus in the DK Ocean book. Really???? This is for kid's, right? I simply can't believe that any writer, editor or publisher for children's literature would allow this picture, albeit small, in a children's education book. I certainly didn't want my boys to get THAT education! I think this is deplorable and inexcusable and I will be sending emails and making phone calls to get a refund. All parents, be forewarned!"
5,Bigger is Better and then Some,"This unit is not only Bigger, but really is better ( than other models ) The manual seal button is great for bagging fruit, cookies and other soft items. ( which would be crushed in some other units ) The improved heat strip, allows multiple seals, wihtout having to wait for it to cool down. The bag storage is convienent, and the cutter is feel is hard to live without ( I am always misplacing my sissors. The company is always there for you, will a toll free number and educated technical people. Can't say enough - Buy One!"
4,The Best of the Best,"After looking at many foodsavers, I feel this is the best buy - Company is always there to talk to you, and help you out. This sealer has a manual seal button, which allows you to seal soft items. ( cookies, meat loaf, fruit etc. without crushing it ) The special heating strip allows for multiple seals without a cool down period. Bag Storage is convient also. After using other models, I can really appreciate the benifits of this model. And if you are like me the auto cutter is worth it's weight in Gold, when looking for that pair of sissors which is always hiding. How this is of help"
2,Redundant,"I had high hopes for this book when I started it, but it's about 500 pages too long. The story becomes repetitive after the characters visit the imajica. Although Clive Barker has an excellent sense of prose, his handle on dialogue is lacking. Once they enter the imajica, they become overly dramatic and redundant. At the beginning I enjoyed the religious metaphor, but by about page 400 I felt it was being shoved down my throat. This book needed a good editor to week out the garbage, there are some great moments and some beautiful prose, but it's not worth digging through this massive volume."
2,"Not giving up on clive,but this book wasn't for me","In short, I feel this book was an epic for epic's sake. Even though it had some interesting visuals and some very complex characters, I thought the story was useless. I never really felt the ""the big threat"" of a ""unreconciled dominions"". And with-out a doubt the reconciliation was the weekest of endings. it was my first read by him and i understand that authors can't please everyone all of the time. I bought Damnation game ,Great and Secret Show and Everville. i truely hope these three books are much better..."
1,One of the worst books I've read.,"I don't get how anybody could like this book. I don't even understand why I finished it. None of the characters are understandable. They don't even understand why they do things. Whenever anybody actually DOES something in this book, it is as if they are compelled to do it. They are in a trance or it just sort of happens.So many things in this book are ""weird for weirds sake."" They don't have meaning, they just stretch out the length of the book with bizarre description after bizarre description, all of them blurring into a huge mess which makes no sense."
3,A good story,"In this fantasy, Clive Barker looks at several intriguing themes such as religion, the roles of the sexes and the journey of self discovery. He gives us a fresh spin on these ideas by taking us into the uniquely original world of Imajica's Five Dominions. I have to admit, at first it was hard for me to put this books down. But Barker's writing style became tiresome during the last few hundred pages. If you're not a fan of the over-inflated ""epic"", you may want to skip this book. I think if Barker could have condensed the prose and stayed focused on his major themes he could have really driven his point home. To me, that would have made it a ""great"" book. So while it's not a terrible book, it's hardly the greatest literary masterpiece of our time either.It's just a good story."
4,Decent condition,"Came with a couple of tears, and some scratches and wear are visible. Binding is bent; obviously very used item."
5,One of the Best!!,"Imajica is one of my favorite books. It's a long one so I suggest new readers take their time and absorb this awesome story. The paperback version is really cool because of the illustrations and the appendix. The illustrations are extremely helpful by giving form to the weird. Just a warning, though, to new readers of the novel who like to be surprised by the unfolding story, using the appendix may contain ""spoilers"" on some of the characters. Anyway, this is a great book. Clive Barker is a genius! Enjoy!"
4,Nostalgia Not Always Best Revisited,"I bought this book again to reread it. I read it in my early twenties and was blown away by it. This time through, not so much. Still a good read full of interesting characters and locations. It's just that I've read other authors since with better imaginations and better vocabularies for expressing those imaginations."
4,An unbelievable undertaking,"This was the first Barker novel I ever read and it is indeed a novel of epic proportions! I really liked this story, it is so far from anything I could ever imagine. There are so many worlds and peoples that sometimes it wasn't always easy reading, but it is well worth the effort. I was turned on to Clive Barker through this book and have been a fan ever since. But this is no light, summer reading, this book takes work and thought. If you stay with it I'm sure you won't be dissappointed. Debbi"
4,"Long, but incredibly worth it.","Make no mistake: this book is an undertaking. But for every moment that I wanted to put it down permanently, it left me with just enough curiosity to continue. The ending chapters in particular thunder forward and made the entire journey feel like so much more than a story. This is material that would make for a great translation into a Hollywood film, possibly two or three movies tied together.I give it 4 stars instead of 5 just because of the sometimes sluggish pace."
1,Too unrealistic,"I tried to get into this novel but I just could not. I seemed too far fetched and too unrealistic. Seemed pretty cool and then the story just took me into a scene which just seemed almost ""silly""."
5,"Imajica, the slightly possible.","I love a novel that leaves nothing out. I love a novel that, although fantastical, tickles your imagination with the possibility of truth hidden within fiction. Clive Barker did all of that and much more with Imajica. You feel Pie's pain, and revel in the self re-discovery or awakening of our favorite Maestro! Many a sleepless night do I owe to this wonderful book. If you value sleep, don't pick this up. I, for one, could never put it down."
4,An excellent idea moulded into a breath taking journey.,"With this book Clive Barker has really achieved something amazing. He has actually managed to keep me reading from page 1 to 800+. This is by far the longest novel I have ever read, but I am glad that I reached the boundaries of the First Dominion and beyond. The character are so well fleshed out that thoughts of what will happen next play on your mind all day. I was truly riveted until the very last page. It twists and turns more than a fish caught on a hook. Truly one of his best yet."
3,Hitchhiker's Guide to the Five Dominions,"As the characters travel through the Dominions, their experiences happen very quickly, leaving unanswered questions. The characters themselves experience significant personality changes which are also unexplained. Finally, other than the 5th Dominion, there are few facts or trends described which establish distinctions between the other four Dominions. The story and plot are interesting, but this book hardly seems to be the huge, thought-provoking adventure that others have praised so lavishly. In short, rent a copy at your library before you buy."
2,"Intriguing Premise, Terrible Execution - Skip It","The theme of the novel is intriguing - five dominions (each representing a major World religion) that is to be united by a demi-god. The fulfilment of this premise is what motivates the reader to slog through the 800-page slough, but the payoff never comes.There is no charismatic characters, heroic or evil. The plot wanders aimlessly, and Barker tries in vain to spice it up with sex and gore. The entire novel starts with a whimper (you can actually skip the first 400 pages), and ends with a whimper.If you want to read well-written dark-fantasy, try Stephen King's ""Dark Tower"" 1&2 (it too goes downhilll thereafter) and Donaldson's ""Thomas Convenant"" series (but not Donaldson's other works)."
1,Disappointing,"I read on Wikipedia that this is Clive Barker's personal favorite of his writings, so I was looking forward to something good. Alas! The book is way too long for its own good with no sense of pacing. I found myself waiting for the end before I had even reached the middle. I kept going in hopes that it would somehow recover, but it never did. The action grinds and trudges and heaves its rambling way along for pages and pages, pausing only for the occasional moment of pointless sex and/or violence. Characterization is poor, so the numerous character die-offs littered throughout the book are mere wastes of time rather than emotional climaxes of any kind. The book seemed to aim towards grand themes and emotions but merely came off as grandiose. All in all, this book was a huge disappointment."
5,"Not since ""The Stand"" have I been so spellbound","Clive Barker novel ""Imajica"" was like a love affair, and I didn't want it to end. I think the great horror writers of yesterday would be quite please with this work. The development of characters was fantastic, some I liked and then hated and some I hated and then came to like(somewhat). If you like big characters and interwoven plots this book is for you, and if you love hardcore horror this is a must read."
5,"SURREAL, BREATHTAKING, AND EUPHORIC !!!","As an avid reader of horror, sci-fi, and fantasy, I have never had a book get me ""high"" to the point where I felt I could leap from a mountain and soar forever. Mr. Barker attains a level of imagination King wishes he had; fleshing out rich, complex characters that remain with you long after you read the last sentence. The story, at its core, deals with love, war, lost identities, and a quest for harmony. I much prefer the complete edition rather than the two-volume edition. Tolkien and Donaldson readers would be missing the reading experience of their life were they not to eneter Barker's world."
5,Clive's most epic novel,"I have read all of Clive Barker's books and none of them is more profound than Imajica. This mystical epic touches on every human emotion. The plot is original, complex, and never boring. There is a love story one minute and a gross description of a corpse the next. Barker does not box himself into a rigid conception of what kind of a writer he is. I loved the book and would recommed it to anyone who is willing to take on such a lengthy novel. (It's over 800 pages)."
