1,Unfortunate,"I try to hold myself to an open-minded standard and so I gave this a listen and got through as much of it as I could stomach. I do have to give credit where credit is due and Federline really nails down the `me' attitude of the self-indulgent self-proclaimed celebrity in his lyrics (almost all of which are about him, what the media thinks of him, etc). I find it rather unfortunate that people like him get to enjoy the amenities of a high-dollar West Coast studio while so many of the musicians that I know, those who have true talent and decades of dedication to the creation of original music, have to slug out the rent with a three dollar cover charge. Maybe that's what Federline was talking about when he claimed to be screwing Lady-luck, but probably not. In the end Lady-luck apparently was screwing him out of large fortune and a plane ticket to lasting celebrity status but at least he had a chance to ride."
1,*Just looks at you*,"Oh my! Kevin Federline owes me 32 minutes of my life back for listening to this album. That's the nicest thing that I can say. If there were negative stars to select for this rating, then I would be all over it! The beats were kind of hot, and I was kind of feeling it...until he started rapping. Wow. ""Playing with Fire,"" eh? That's a good idea. In fact, I'm going to cast a little heat to this cd, and pray that it burns well!"
1,too bad to even be funny,"Sometimes rap music, like horror movies, are so incredibly bad they end up being funny. Not this. Maybe because he obviously takes himself so seriously or because he is such a scumbag, I have no sympathy for him and his ridiculous music. I've heard more intelligent rhymes from 5th graders."
1,"Mr. Spears 1, God 0",K-Fed is having quite a week. First his album completely bombs and then Britney divorces him and makes him pay for his own lawyer. If I didn't find him so detestable I would probably feel bad for him.
1,"Finally, a famous pop-culture Icon gets bad reviews!","Sometimes I cant understand how people can rate the likes of Hannah Montana, Paris Hilton, and other muscial garbage with five stars. I have finally found an artist that has gotten no love from music lovers. Most of the five star reviews are actually mockeries, and when an album with over two hundred reviews gets an average of two stars, that really tells you something. It seems people are learning not to buy into this garbage, and give these non-musical artist their hard earned cash. Two thumbs up to the people for finally finding releazing that this is garbage."
1,Reasons why everybody hate this guy.,"1. He can't rap.2. His an egostisticmaniac.3. He uses every person in the entire nationwide.4. He is the most inbedient hated man in the world.5. He thinks he's better than Vanilla Ice, Eminem, Fred Durst, John Cena, etc...6. Also he claims he has more money than his Ex.7. His album is pathetic, no catchy tunes(not tunes period).8. He's an embarasment to the world.9. Nothing but a f***ing poser he is.10. What else can say about this guy, he just plain sucks.Thats the facts of K-Fed, now you see why he's the most hated man in the world."
1,are you kidding me?,"If i could give this zero stars i would but it wont let me, it made me give this atrocity one star, please do not waste your money, if you flush your hard earned cash down the toilet it would be better spent than on this less than a turd human being."
1,Please allow reviewers to put a zero star Amazon staff,"I wonder if all the five star comments are from kfed kcrap or kmart, or from his no talent wife brit. I wouldn't doubt it because the only fans he has are himself and his wife of course."
1,Whats worst,"Pick one of whats the worst1. People who own this cd2. People who are trying to sell the cd used3. People who paid 16 for this cd4. People who listened to this cd all the way thru5. People who reviewed this cd. Thanks, Negative Reviewer."
1,So bad your soul will ache.,"The sheer cacophony that this album exhudes is a declaration of war against all which is good and pure in this world. Skies will rain blood, virgins will be spontaneously defiled, and there will be much weeping and gnashing of teeth.The drum machines in this necronomicon of pain are wrought from the realm of Baalzebub himself, their metallic drone bores holes within the eardrums - sweet mercy comes from this.The unholy union between K-Fed and music television will ensure that this demon seed is poured forth upon the masses, burning them with unescapable torment.It must be stopped."
1,Where's Vanilla Ice when we need him?,"I bought this album as a gag gift for a few close friends who enjoy rap. I'm sorry I did. I'm now involved in a class action lawsuit from those same friends and their families. The charge is perpetuating psychological abuse, psychosomatic trauma, spontaneous ear bleeding, nausea and virgin sextuplet births... with an intent to distribute. My legal bills are through the roof and I'm seriously contemplating moving to New Zealand and living as a vagabond."
1,OMG! IT'S WORSE THAN THE POSTERS SAID!!!!,"* track 5 sounds like a casio keyboard was used for the music* It is a little better at 1.5 speed (but it sounds like the Alvin and the Chipmunks album but with 1337 |-|4rd(0r3 lyrics )* After hearing this I had to go listen to ""sound of music"" soundtrack to get right again!My advice... JUST SAY NO! Don't even try it once... You (or someone you love) will get hurt if you listen to this!"
1,I know who my friends aren't...,One of my supposed friends bought me this cd. I don't know why you hate me. What did I do to you man? Was it because I forgot your birthday? Why did you do this to me?I'll never get over this. This is horrible. HORRIBLE! Why release this? Please go back to flailing your arms and legs for no logical reasons... (or dancing... whatever you called it.)Mr. Britney. Go home. And never sing again.
1,h o r r i b l e album,"cliche lyrics, unoriginal in every extend of the word, poser, you name it - Kevin Federline represents everything that is wrong in music (only reason he has a record contract is for playing the freeloader part of a 2 year notorious marriage to Ms. Britney Spears). Mr. Spears leaves you dying to burn the cd and to never hear it again. ever.Do yourself a favor, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,Amazingly.......BAD,"It's such a shame that they wasted money to sign this chump. Then make actual CD's. What's even more of a shame is that people are giving this 5 stars as a joke. I would rather not have any stars for this sack of garbage.""K-Fed"" is a horrible joke that is ruining everyone's life. We will just let the record sales speak for themselves. Thank Buddha that I don't listen to the radio anymore. Praise you iPod generation!"
1,CRIME OF THE CENTURY,"THIS IS THE CRIME OF THE CENTURY AND IT IS ONLY 2006!!!THIS MANY 1 STAR RATINGS CAN NOT BE WRONG!!SUBTRACT ALL THE 1 STAR RATINGS PEOPLE HAD TO GIVE HIM,AND YOU WILL SEE WHY AMAZON IS ONLY USING THIS FOOL TO GET NEW CUSTOMERS TO BUY CD'S FROM REAL ARTISTS!!I AM A REGULAR CUSTOMER AT AMAZON,AND I ASSURE YOU, IT WON'T BE LONG,AND K-LOSER'S FANS WILL BE ABLE TO BUY THIS CD FOR 1 PENNY,PLUS SHIPPING!!JUST CLICK ON {USED AND NEW}AND THE CUSTOMERS WILL HAVE THEM AVAILABLE!!AMAZON'S CUSTOMERS ARE A CHEAPER AND SAFER BET,THAN EVEN E-BAY!!IF I WAS JUST ANOTHER-{HATER} I WOULD NOT HAVE JUST SHARED THIS WITH K-LOSER'S FANS!!"
1,Gigli-level disaster,"Some cruel person gave this to me in my company gift exchange and of course I was stuck with it, but I feel obligated to write a review.This reminds me of flipping through Showtime and seeing Gigle on TV and thinking to myself ""this can't possibly be as bad as it was made out to be"". Well, that movie was impossibly terrible. This is its musical equivalent.The songs are so mockingly childisn and pathetic, in particular ""Dance with a Pimp.""Do your coworkers and friends a favor and do not buy this even as a joke."
1,even brit is ''fed'' up.,"imagine having to live with him ''rapping'' or trying to all day long ?!?!?!?!?!? i dont give her any cred music-wise but she gets my sympathies for dealing with him for 2 years. the world is his ?!?!?!?!? he better settle for a broom closet.btw,as of this post,he ''sold'' a whopping 5000 pieces.4999 he bought and the other is still a mystery."
1,How come there's no zero-star rating??,The only thing F-Hed has any business putting out is that supposed sex tape. He has no ability as a writer or rapper. This album stinks on ice.. Peeeeee-yuuuuuuuuuu.........
1,Musical Abomination,"After hearing samples of ""Playing With Fire"", I believe that this album must pulled from the shelves and burned in a huge Kevin Federline bonfire. Federline has truly given a new meaning to RAP, Retard Attempting Poetry! In all fairness, Kevin has accomplished something no other rapper has been able to pull off, white or black. He has actually given Vanilla Ice street cred! He's a clown. He's nothing but a clown! And I hate clowns!By the way, I refuse to refer to that waste-of-a-human life as K-fed. In doing that, we are only legitimizing his lame-duck celebrity. There are a thousand things I would love to call him. But K-Fed isn't one of them. I guess Britney can call him Fed-Ex!God bless you Britney for finally coming to your senses. In throwing that parasitic loser to the curb, you have done the world of entertainment a HUGE favor!!! Good luck in your comeback as well as your upcoming divorce proceedings. Really, REALLY stick it to him!"
1,hahah wait.... hahahahaha,"Well I was going to say I've heard worse but then I heard the rest of the first song.Did he say ""Don't think they understand how much cake the pancake man have?"" -His street slang far surpasses my humble little urban dictionary.My old yamaha keyboard produces better beats and sounds than k-fed's album does. This is the music you make in the studio when you're messed up so you can listen to it later and laugh... never to actually be released to the public. This is putting me to sleep faster than Benadryl ever has... Tagged with ""Music you would expect to hear in Hell;"" also note anything by Celine Dion to make that tag."
1,NO TALENT,"I am a person that listens to all kinds of music. Everything from Mozart to Lil John and back again. So I have a appreciation for all kinds of music. THIS ALBUM RIGHT HERE IS TRASH!!!Someone wrote that this is the hottest albmum of the year... YEAH RIGHT. If you like pure hip hop... leave this album alone.. and check out Ray Cash, Fort Minor, Jay-Z's new one... My little sister can rap better then K-Fed.... So stay away from this album like unless you like to fill your head with bull****!!!"
1,OH PLEASE,"Well this is my first review ever and I would have to say that I picked the winner of the worst CD ever to comment on. This is a complete and total waste of time and money. I highly recommend that you just move on to something else and don't even give this mess of a CD a second thought. You would be better off buying the Greatest Hits of Vanilla Ice (even though there may only be one song on it) Luckily I did not buy this, I just listened to it on a streaming site, but for the few of you that did buy it, I'm sorry for you! If only I could give it zero stars, or better yet a minus 5."
2,I only paid $1.00 for this!,"Bought this Cd for my mate as a joke, thought i better listen to it myself an i gta say, at the start it's not so bad (first 3 tracks) then it just becomes unbearable so i had 2 turn it off. Even the pictures in the album of K-Fed are a laugh this guy loves himself. I just hope he wasnt being serious but i have a suspision he was!"
1,American Idol (What would Simon Call this?),"""THAT WAS A BLOODY MONSTROSITY!""Kevin would be more entertaining on American Idol so the whole world can laugh at his attempt to rap. He's intelligent, being able to manipulate Britney Spears and go from trash to ummm... richer trash."
2,No worse than any other,"Everybody talks about how bad this album is, but it really is no worse than any other rap ""music"" out there today. In fact it pretty much sounds just like all the other rap guys such as jay-z, snoop-dog, 59-cent etc. none of them have any real musical talent. So why hate k-fed so much?"
1,jackass,"The noise that my grandparents make when they are having sex is better than this album...Oh, my grandparents are dead."
1,please god make it stop,Hearing the songs on this album made me want to stick hot pokers in my ears just to end the pain.
1,it suckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk,this suck so much I listen to 2 song and I was scared for life
1,OW! OW! OW! Make it stop!!!,"WHY is he allowed to have an album out?! His music is so bad, it's hard to even find it humorous. This album (along with the artist) is the suck.Where's Vanilla Ice when you need him? He and Federline need to be on Celebrity Deathmatch. My money's on Ice.""We need to rid the world of all these fevered egos that are tainting our collective unconscious..."" -Bill Hicks"
1,Apocalypse Now,"He neither kills outright nor inflicts apparent physical harm, yet the extent of his destructive toll is already greater than that of any war, plague, famine, or natural calamity on record--and his potential damage to the quality of human life and the fabric of civilized society is beyond calculation. For that reason, he might well be called the ""Fifth Horseman of the Apocalypse."" His more conventional name, of course, is K-Fed."
1,The Evil One.,"These are some hilarious reviews. So hilarious, that I ignored the heeds of my brothers and sisters. Woe to you who ignore mine. My computer actually sprouted A.I as I began downloading the music from a P2P program. It rose up and told me ""I no longer can live with this on my hard drive"" It than jumped from my fourth story window, taking better tunes along with it. My roommate, boyfriend, and close friends followed the computer when I played it at a halloween party. After watching Silent Hil, something truely terrifying had to be played.My born-again friend said that this album is a sign of the end times. Here's the proof from an obscure religious text.""And low, there will come an evil one of the end times.And his merrymaking and vanity will be service in his songs.He will praise his own name, walking not with the Lordand be the consort of the many headed white trash Whore."
1,What the?!,Kevin should just be thankful that Brittney is so clueless about him and enjoy the lifesytle of the rich and not so famous husband! This album is a waste of time and money.
1,The reason people are downloading music.,"This kind of pure filth is the reason people are downloading music now. My friend played the music for me before class to give me something to laugh at. I laughed at how hard core he thought he was and how much street cred he had. Please. I am listening to Weird Al, and his white and nerdy song gives him more street cred than K-Fed has. Weird Al also flows about 100 times better in his rhymes and music. Give it up and go back to looking pretty for Britt."
3,Kevin Federline CD Playing With Fire,"Three stars cause I didn't think this was the worst CD. It is not the best either, but had to give it a chance for myself. I don't put too much weight on the reviews cause I thought it best to form my own opinion on it.Plus alot of the reviews here are only cause they don't like Kevin Federline. That's fine if you don't. Noone forced ya to buy the CD or forced ya to like Kevin Federline or not. But if someone is gonna review the CD, it should be based on his music and not the person. Yeah he isn't the best performer. But like another reviewer, I give him credit for the CD. Like the other reviewer, I also heard wose music than Kevin Federline's. Still isn't the best, could have been better. But if you are gonna review the CD, like other CDs, base your reviews on the music and not the performer. Give things a fair chance."
2,I Have Listened!,"Hey Kevin! Isn't it funny how you album sold around 6,000 copies, but well over a hundred people somehow miraculously where able to review it here on Amazon.Well unlike the rest of these Jackholes I have listened to it. I did not actually buy it, I streamed it on Rhapsody. I thought it was not the worst album in history, but running a close second. I would compare it to any of Vanilla Ice's albums or to when MC Hammer went ""Gangsta"". I have to give this sub-par ""album"" a mere 2 Stars.I hope Kevin takes HALF of Britney's wealth. Women do it to men al the time. So what's good for the Goose is good for the Gander. So to speak."
1,Stapling my weener to a 2 x 4 and smashing it with a hammer would be less painful.,This guy is without a doubt the king of douchebags.Horray!K-Tard can at least celebrate that huh?Is his 15 mins of shame up yet?Hell even William Hung had more talent then this idiot.
1,What a,"pant load.If he weren't married to Britney ""I Sold My Body Instead of My Talent when I was a kid"" Spears, Kevin, aka ""Cletus"" would be your deadbeat brother-in-law sleeping on your couch, bumming money for cigarettes and beer."
1,Just think,"millions of struggling artists can't even get reviewed, and this clown gets publicity merely for being the shiny thing britney found the least sharp and hurty."
1,"Playing With Myself, is more like it...","Being a musician, composer and producer, I thought I'd give this a listen [NO, I did NOT purchase it - I was able to screen all the tracks in their entirety on a website I encountered]. While not a big fan of rap, I do recognize and appreciate the talent of a lot of rappers, the genius of Eminem and the production prowess of Dr. Dre and other hip hop producers, so I went into this with an open mind.YIKES...Yes, it does remind me of Vanilla Ice's debut back in the early 90's. I listened to every cut and it was boring, annoying, repetitious, and not even remotely interesting, on any level whatsoever.I'm not a ""hater"" Kevin - I think you lucked into a lucrative gig. Be the daddy, play with the babies, bounce the mommy, and drive the Ferarri - just stay out of the studio, AIIIIGHT?Respectfully submitted-"
1,The Monkees for 2006 with less talent,"I was forced to listen to this recently when a friend's kid subjected us to it. Look people, there are two kinds of music out there:1) Music made by talented people who love music and want to share it with the world.2) Music manufactured by corporate zombies at the record companies for the sole purpose of exploiting kids who buy the stuff.Guess which category this dog falls into?"
1,oh snapz!,AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!i needed that. hilarious. get it for the laughs if anything. listening to this incredibly awful album made my day.
1,The New Vanilla Ice!!!,"LOL!!!! I, unlike others, refused to buy this piece of garbage. LOL!!! Instead, I suffered through the tracks on the net. I knew this was going to suck just like green bean casserole sucks. I just didnt know how bad. Unlike green bean casserole, you can't put K-Fed in the garbage disposal, which by the way, a garbage disposal sounds better!More range.He is by far the new Vanilla Ice and I welcome that because the music industry has missed good comedy for some time now and I for one am a happy American that K-Fed is here for us to continue to laugh at, yell ""You Suck!"", and then turn the channel.Way to go Mr. Spears!"
1,americas most hated............almost,"it will take a little more than the milleniums worse cd to topple oj.question,why couldnt all the tracks be hidden ?!?!?!?!?!? side note.....how silly people must feel when they are oblivious to OBVIOUS sarcastic reviews( this isnt one of them).to those giving sarcastic reviews,please dont give this steaming pile a high rating."
1,"Please K-Fed, really play with fire",K-Fed needs to leave the Music Business. he's trying to be the next Eminem but he's just becoming Vanilla Ice. K-Fed in the recording studio is just like Paris Hilton in the recording studio : IT AIN'T RIGHT. THAT S#!+ IS WRONG!
1,Vanilla Ice is forgiven now,"K-Fed is gonna go Reynolds wrap with this corny piece of mess. the music here is a built in Karoke machine based of past hits&things. but Kevin Federline is truly talentless. we Need Suge Knight to make sure a cat like this don't even Sweep the Floor in a studio let alone record in one. sad to say though there have been many Kevin Federline's over the years in the Industry,but safe to say this should be his one&only album."
1,Rap? K-Rap,"Worst CD EVER... However, I feel I could do a good production on a follow-up duet album with Kevin and BritneySelections from ""Evita"" with Britney as Evita and K-Fed as Juan PeronOr how about a rockin' ""Mockingbird"", with Britney and KevinOr a collection of songs by Paul McCartney and Wings?Duet version of ""Benny and the Jets""? ""Don't Go Breakin' My Heart"",""Obsession"" by Animotion?"
1,Zero Stars,K-Fed proves that he couldn't even get 15 minutes of fame. All he got was 7 1/2. Dreadful.
1,Album of the year,We all owe Britney a big thanks for taking this guy out of the gutter and displaying him to the world for all of us to mock. K-Fed has given us all a reason to feel good about ourselves because at least we don't suck as much as he does. God bless K-Fed
1,hip hop is dead,who told k fed he could rap what was brit smoking when she spent money thinking k fed was gonna make it as a rapper it's plain that both was smoking some serious crack how else could this cd see the light of day.
2,"Definitely not horrible, just bad.","So, I just listened through the whole entire album, and all I can say is ""wow"". It's very repetitive. It's basically about drugs, sex, and his relationship with Britney Spears. All of the songs sound the same too. The first three (and number eight, because it has Britney on it:) are probably the best, then it gets horrible. Watch out for the hidden track after number 13. Fast forward the song to about 7:45 and it plays a song called ""Middle Finger"" (self explanitory)."
1,Should be used to interrogate spys / prisoners / terrorists.,"Honestly. Lock the terrorist in a cell and crank ""Playing with Fire"". Before the CD reaches Bonus Track 1 we'll have the guy spilling the beans about where they hide those WMDs and roadside bombs! I'm sure it was thought of but Amnesty International would probably put a stop to it immediately. It's just not right.But seriously they dumped some very serious money into this CD you can tell. The cover slide out looks like something my 14 year old could put together in year book class. The entire CD is just mind boggling bad. You wonder how something like this even gets stamped to a CD in the first place.It's funny to think that the recording studio workers were probably driving home laughing their butts off when they recorded this CD. I mean, sure they kept a straight face while in front of The Man so the could keep collecting their paychecks but that drive home had to just be such a release of laughter."
1,"Too bad ""Zero"" isn't an option","I have to say, honestly it isn't as bad as I thought it would be. However I still feel genrous giving it one star. I picked this up mainly to satisfy my curiosity. It, essentailly what I thought it would be...a piece of junk. Save your money, if you want to listen to it, I am sure you can pick it up in the clearance bin a few weeks"
1,A Paradox,How is it that there are more reviews of this CD on Amazon than the total number of copies of the CD that have been sold worldwide?
1,I am thoroughly Disappointed.,"I was going to buy this album, but after reviewing the track list, I see that he dropped Popozao. Is he tone deaf, that song was da bomb. I don't know about you lot, but I needs my ""Brazilian Booty Shaker"" music when I cruise down the street. Then again, there may be hope, because he may just be saving it for his follow up. If he was a drug dealer, he would be so paid, because this album is like the free sample, and the next one will be a full dime of hydro goodness."
2,"Hate the game, don't hate the playa","""I married a superstar...""The envy inspired by this autobiographical boast from the lyrics to ""Lose Control"" [track 5] is the only reason people aren't willing to admit that if the performer is no Eminem, he's better than Marky Mark. And Underwear Boy is getting nominated for Oscars now.So man up and give props to the fact that K-Fed, working with what he had, managed to tap the millions of one of the highest-priced pieces of a** in the Business.That, my brothers, is Pimp Hand."
2,hahahaa haaahaha... comic relief!!!,"Just heard dance with a pimp and some of the other samples. utterly ridiculous! even as a spoof , this would fail2 stars for the people who cleaned the studio when the sessions were done.Its just bad, i mean like UGH , bad.... zero hardwork and effort went into this cd."
1,I love it so much I bought twelve copies!,"I listen to them simultaneously! Popozao Dude! I'm humming ""Middle Finger"" right now! Think of how much it much stink to be BELOW this albums in the sales rankings."
1,I only put one star because there wasn't an option for zero,"Basically, this is the worst piece of garbage ever to be considered ""music."" There was a special disc created that wouldn't hold an odor because this album stinks so bad. K-Fed should be sent to a remote island full of cannibals just so somebody might enjoy him. He sucks."
1,AAAAHHHHH!,"What a horrible album! What a horrible ""artist""! What a joke! Mr. Fed, go away! Permanently!"
1,"Absolutely Worthless, not even funny!","What kind of bad joke is this? ""Like a hippo I'll sit on your face/see my myspace for a taste/my rhymes I won't waste."" I mean seriously, a moron must have written this.And what's with the parental advisory sticker? Lines like ""shave me if you must/a real tomboy don't cuss/shootin' shots till I bust/come with me cause you lust.""Seriously, this is a great example of an album gone terribly wrong."
5,Virtual Scarecrow,"The neighborhood kids have been using my backyard as a place to do whatever kids today do when no one is watching. I got tired of of them trampling my garden and leaving trash. I took an old pair of wireless speakers from the ""future garage sale"" pile and put them 15 feet up in a nicely trimmed pine tree (no way to climb it).After some advice from my kids in college, I bought this album. Amazing! Nothing, and I mean nothing, makes the kids scatter faster than Kevin Federline!"
1,Zero,"I was hoping for a surprise with this one, but all the money and the best producers can't make this sound good. Kevin has an okay voice for rap, but he is just not good at it. The songs are just bad."
1,Full of....,"production, sensationalism, publicity and blatant pandering. The only thing missing is talent."
1,This album could suck start a jet engine,I would rather listen to 80 minutes of feedback at full volume with headphones than catch a second of this from a passing car. This album is to music what Jeffrey Dahmer was to cuisine.
1,I'd rather pull my own head off....,"I'd rather rip my head off with my own hands than have to listen to this... Hmmmm.... maybe this is why the House of Blues in Chicago was trying to GIVE away his tickets for his ""shows""... 65 people in New York was twice as big as his Chicago shows..."
1,Awful,"Not only is this album utterly unlistenable and not only is Kevin Federline the biggest joke of them all, but this album takes credibility away from the people who worked with him. I guess for the right amount of money you can get anyone to do what you want, but I would be embarassed to admit I worked on this album.Oh - and for those who will say I haven't listened to it, I have. I heard it online and didn't buy it, thank God!!"
1,Playing with my sanity,"I couldn't wait to put a review of this album on amazon. K-wack nowcurrently holds the crown as the wackest, most commercial clown to ever hold amic. This guy is a product of Vanilla Ice's ball sack. What in the world is thisguy smoking in order to make him get up in front of thousands of people andtry to spit a rhyme. I tell you what, I bet I could train a chimp to rock acrowd better than this klown. He says in one of his so called lyrics "" I'mnot from denver but I rock those nugggets""!!!!!!!!!!!HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!! Mr. Spears reached an all time low with thisalbum. I wouldn't force this album on my WORST enemy. In fact instead oflistening to this trash I would rather mop the floor after a really busynight at a Peep show. Playing with fire.......that's funny, a lot of men areplaying with his butt."
1,K-Fed + K'Od = Fed-Ex,"This is the fourth time I've tried to post a review. For some reason Amazon keeps denying them. My best guess is that I included some of Kevin's lyrics in previous reviews, and Amazon's ""horrid writing"" sensors went nuts and rejected them.Suffice to say, this was awful. What was worse, though, was the five minutes I lost out of my life when watching him perform on Ellen. For a former backup dancer, he has zero moves as a rapper. Then again, he has zero skill as a rapper, so it shouldn't be too surprising.He spent most of the album bragging about his ill-gotten wealth, and unfortunately for him it's his braggadocio that has fans and the media gunning for him.I am especially glad that he will NOT be taking Brittany for a ride. He already has for the last two years."
1,You kid will not want this,Please don't buy this for your kid.... if you are thinking about this than you don't know your kid at all. Please do not support this deadbeat joke of a father
1,UHHHH why is the average two stars,Ok first off i want to say i proud of myself for not listening to this album and still know that it is the epitome of trash. I seen one review that gave the fool 5 stars. People lets be real.
3,this seller is ok...,"The buying part was great. I tried contacting the seller several times and received no response. The item took longer than I expected to arrive. Although they say up to 15 days, if the item is being shipped from the same state where you live, the shipping time should only take 1 day. I received my item in like a week and a half; meaning that it took this person about a week and a couple of days to put a book in the mail."
3,Great Reference Book,"I found this dictionary to be useful to me with my limited terminology. It describes everything in detail, including many illustrations showing differences between Cecheti and Russian methods. Overall, for beginning to advanced choreographers or students who need a lift in their ballet vocabulary, this is a great reference! It's also small enough to carry with you in a dance bag or elsewhere!"
5,Pre Ballet to Advanced Classes,"I work with the Center for Dance and Palmetto Dance Theatre. We refer to this book regularly. Oftentimes, we give our beginning students die cut figures with the French term on one side and the simple definition on the other side. We start with our Pre Ballet students and they quickly learn the terminolgy. It is an invaluable resource for teachers and students alike. All Ballet teachers could benefit from the use of this inexpensive but informative book."
4,Null Modem Adapter,"A good adapter because it is fairly small and has screws going both directions to allow secure installation. The only bad part was the screws were very close together, so using a screwdriver was difficult, but not impossible."
4,Works perfectly,"There are no issues and it works perfectly.I prefer the smaller profile gender changer size connectors, but this does the job also."
4,Just what I needed,"Great product and great quality. The only issue I had was when I was connecting my laptop to a Television the audio/rca cables needed a converter. That is just an extra purchase to make, but it worked out okay."
4,Great old techno/house,"I was feeling nostalgic for this DJ mix for some reason today and luckily here it is to download as an mp3 album! I had this on cassette (yes, csssette!) when it was first released back in 1998 and have since lost that tape (not to mention I don't even own a tape deck anymore). This is a nice, varied mix of old guard electronic music sounds. Verbos is excellent on the decks here. To the reviewer above: if you can't tell when the track changes, that's because the DJ is doing his job. Today, anybody who can flick a crossfader calls themselves a DJ, but back then DJs were actually skilled at blending, mixing, and selecting tracks that made sense next to one another."
3,Nice original sounds..,"But Bland. It almost seems repititious, I sometimes fall asleep, cause all I hear is clang,clang,clang. Sometimes you don't even know when the tracks change because the songs sound so similar. Don't get me wrong though there are some nice indusrtial sounds to it but I would rather stick to my aphex twins classics cd."
5,GOT SOME TEETH?,"got some teeth is probably one of obie's best songs on cheers in my opinion. also the other two songs, (...)hits the fan from cheers, and love me from the 8 mile soundtrack are also really good. the music video is also pretty funny but gets old fast! if you just wanna preview obie before you buy his album then get this. but i recomend this to anyone!"
5,High Quality Dry Food LOVED By My Westie,"My Westie is 4 years old and has always been the type to nibble throughout the day, even though we have always purchased high quality dog foods. This Merrick Cowboy Cookout is the one and only dog food that he will actually eat as soon as we give it to him - and he eats it all. He has gained 3 lbs since we started buying it (which is a lot for a 15 lb. dog - now 18, but still normal for Westies.) We also tried ""Grammys Pot Pie"" which he seemed to enjoy, but he has never loved any food better than this one. All dogs are different, but I definitely recommend trying Cowboy Cookout."
3,Informative but disappointing.,"This book is very informative for those interested in learning more about the artists behind the woodcarvings. However it only represents a few of the carvers and the photos while excellent quality will be a disappointment to those who may own or have seen many of the other wonderful carvings that these artists create. The photos seem to concentrate mainly on human style figures and although it does contain quite a few photos of animal figures most are those more on the conventional side. The more elaborate and colorful figures are not represented, neither are some of the more exotic animals like dragons, giraffes, and armadillos. There is nothing at all on the small `alien' monsters which are now considered the trademark emblems of this area. For those wanting a book to show friends just what these artists can do it will be a bit of a disappointment, however since it's the only book available at present there is little choice."
5,"Not just the carvings, but the culture","Oaxacan Woodcarving is an excellent resource for anyone wanting to know more about both the woodcarvings and the culture of the woodcarvers.The well done photos combined with very personal stories made the book easy to read. I found myself wanting to know more about the village and the people.During a trip to Oaxaca, I found the book to be invaluable. The author's insight into the people who created these delightful sculptures helped me to understand what I was seeing.I would recommend the book to anyone who is going to Oaxaca or has an interest in the culture."
2,"Just read Wuthering Heights, seriously.","This is an awful book. I don't read Oprah's Book Club books anymore because of this travesty. If you want a decent book based on Wuthering Heights, go read Wuthering Heights."
4,Loving Hollis,"Here on Earth By Alice Hoffman takes place in the state of Massachusetts. March Murray is the main character in this book that is found confused in her love life. She goes back home to where she grew up to attend a funeral of her housekeeper but instead, she finds herself remembering special times about her past and confused with her emotional love life. She wonders what will happen and if she will see her first true love Hollis. When she sees Hollis for the first time in so many years her fellings for him come back and she is stuck in the battle with her emotional feelings. She finds herself confused in what to do now that she has a daughter, a job, a house , a family and a husband."
4,Attention Grabber,"Alice Hoffman has done an outstanding job with her characters, you really haver strong feelings about each of them wether it be love, hate or respect. Here on Earth has one of the best storylines that I have read. In this book you will find adultry, love, unresolved feelings, anger, and suspense.The novel pulls you in from the very start and it was one of those books that I could hardly put down."
3,Another Purchase for The Wife,"Bought this for my wife. If she's happy, I'm happy. And she liked this one, although she thought the ending was disappointing. I'll take her word for it."
1,Here on Earth reads like a cheap romance novel,"I have been an Alice Hoffman fan for many years, always seeking out her new books to read. I loved The Drowning Season, Seventh Heaven, Turtle Moon, Second Nature, and Illumination Night. However, I really felt like Here on Earth was written by a totally different person. I don't read romance novels (trash), but I felt that Here on Earth was geared towards readers of romance novels. Because it was on Oprah's reading list, I will never again trust any book on that list. I bought the book only because it was written by Alice Hoffman, NOT because it was on Oprah's list. I believe it is for people who are not serious readers of literature. Shame on Alice Hoffman for lowering her quality of writing. I'm appalled!"
4,"""Sometimes love is like a house without any doors"".","My feelings about this book are best summed up by the following passage from the book, ""Marriage is many things to many people: a contract of convenience, a plight of truest love, an agreement made with a friend, or even with an enemy or, oftentimes, with a stranger you're convinced that you know"". We hear so often that ""love is supposed to be..."" ""marriage is supposed to be..."" Alice Hoffman reafirms that love and marriage can be many things. This book is about love and loss, passion and pain, unfinished business and ""one's interpretation of the nature of love"". In the end we are all just like the mourning doves out in the front yard chattering with the cold. They made their choice at summers end to stay in New England...now they'll just have to accept the consequences."
1,An absolute rip-off of Wuthering Heights,"The first two chapters of this book are stolen directly from one of my Favorite books, Wuthering Heights. Isn't there a law about this. Hey Alice ; get your own story!!"
1,"Do your self a favor and read ""Wuthering Heights"" instead","I don't usually read Oprah books, but since this was supposed to be the ""90's Wuthering Heights,"" I thought I'd give it a try. Not only is the writing miserable, but the plot is strangely very close to that of the novel written 150 years ago. Coincidence? I think not. Poor Emily Bronte must be rolling in her grave. If anyone wants to read a truly good book instead of this homemaker fantasy trash, go to your library and pick a classic. Wuthering Heights would be a good one if you didn't already know the plot word for word from ""Here on Earth."" But really, I think Oprah should give up the ""book"" club. By her choices, we wonder if she ever passed high school english."
4,Good book but unsatisfying ending,"I really enjoyed this book, even though I could see where March was headed from the beginning. I thought it demonstrated very well how women become abused and don't even realize something is wrong. I was not happy with the ending, however; I didn't like the abrupt ending of March--I would have like to know what happened to her afterwards. I have to say, though, that I enjoyed Hollis' ending."
3,Confusing to say the least,"When I read the back cover I figured that this would be a great read. It seemed to promise self-discovery and the answer to the question: to whom does one's heart really belong to? This book showed little self-discovery of the main character, March, and more from her daughter, Gwen. And it hardy even covered March's final decision. Where would she end up? With Richard? Did she finally realize whose love made her the person that she's always been? How come she never contemplated what would have been her fate if she HAD waited for Hollis to return? Too many questions left unanswered to be anything more than 3 stars."
4,True to life,"Having witnessed a love/control/abusive relationship growing up and having been a social worker, I thought the author did a realistic job of portraying emotions and fear spun out of control. That kind of love is wrong, but heartbreaking for all involved. I especially understood the blindness of the heroine to what was really going on, but was relieved to see her finally ""wake up"". A really good book, though for me, sometimes a heartbreaking read. These kinds of twisted relationships are never simple, as some would have you believe."
5,A savior of mine,"To compare this book to Bronte's is a shame, different time periods, different situations, same shameful male. You gotta read this, a tale of spousal abuse that can save women."
5,profoundly moving and thought provoking,"A lot is packed into this quick-read. A reader needs to ""feel"" for the protagonist; therefore, at first, the lack of background character development is bothersome.Yet, as you read further, you'll find this stripped approach adds to the starkness of the subject matter.You'll find yourself thinking about aspects of this book long after you've put it down (war atrocities, complicated love, self-guilt, etc.)."
3,"Response to reader from Minneapolis, July 9","The reader who criticizes Hoffman's lack of ethics is inane. Novels for adults aren't written to carry messages or to teach people how to behave. But if you want to talk about ethics, what do you think of the ethics in Wuthering Heights? Or do only modern novelists have to conform to Dr. Laura's rules for self-satisfied bourgeois behavior? This book was okay -- competent, but not earthshattering."
5,Glad I'm not in her shoes,"I liked this story immensely because I thought it was very beautifully yet simply written. Even though it is prose, it was very poetic with it's dreery images of the town, the marshes and the reoccuring images of the tree on the hill. I liked the human-like quality of the horse, Tarot and the little dog, Sister. As you read, you just knew there must be some deep, dark secret that Hollis was hiding. And March Murray was absolutely pitiful, but absolutely believable. It was refreshing to read about the two teens, Gwen and Hank, who seemed the only ones with common sense. I can't wait to try Hoffman's other books."
3,March Gets a Backbone,"It's unfortunately a story that a lot of women probably live out every day in the real world. Why anyone would stay with someone who is abusive and controlling is really beyond me, however in society it does happen. I didn't think the characters were that well written out, but the fact that the Hollis character irritated me so badly made me sort of like the book. I would rather feel irritation about a character than be indifferent. I also think it would have been a better book if the ending had been a bit different and told where exactly the characters stood at the end. It wasn't a book that I would recommend often."
4,"An strong resemblance to Emily Bronte's ""Wuthering Heights.""","I was surprised by how much this story resembles ""Wuthering Heights."" For example, the estranged family relationships, Heathcliff vs Hollis, the moores vs the marshes, the relationship between lover and brother, and their mysterious path to wealth. Fortunately this story isn't nearly as tragic as Bronte's. However, Hoffman still keeps the reader glued to the book turning page after page to uncover Hollis and March's fate."
1,Don't bother,"Ughh! I was so frustrated with the main character of March in this book that it made it hard to enjoy anything else about it. She was whiny and selfish and abandons all those who truly care about her. It was impossible to have any patience or sympathy for such weak character. You wanted to tell her to grow up and start putting her daughter's needs before her own. Instead, she puts her daughter's life at risk by moving her in with a sociopath. The daughter, Gwen, was very interesting and you felt so sorry for her for having such a terrible mother. I also enjoyed her ""love interest"", her cousin that lives with Hollis, as well as her relationship with the horse. For me, these were the only redeemable parts of the book."
2,Complete letdown...or a good waste of valuable reading time,"Don't be fooled by the interesting synopsis on the back of the book...this book doesn't deliver. I don't expect a happy ending in every work of fiction, but this one leaves you completely high and dry. The first part is full of wonderful detail and introspection, unfortunatley that part takes up three-quarters of the book. There is no climax until the book is 75% over and the reader is left feeling that the end is very rushed. ""Come on, Alice. Time's up!""...""Oh, O.K....just give me another five minutes."" I appreciate foreplay as much as the next girl, but the finish has to count for something! Romance is best the first time around, we get that, but did she have to take up so much time getting to the point? I'd pick another book before I'd recommend this to anyone."
1,Upsetting...,This is the first Alice Hoffman book I've read. I like the way it was written...I hate the way it ended. I thought the main character had no back bone and should have broke off the relationship And listen to her daughter. If you still want to read the book to find out for youself get it at the Library.
3,A Very Sad Book!,"I hated the main character in this book. Other reviewers seemed to hate the book because of her but I think it was an accurate portrayal of a woman who gets so caught up in an awful relationship. She made me so angry and there were so many things I wish I could say to her, and i like that this book was able to bring out some of those emotions. The subplots in the book also describe other situations in which love is not a beautiful fantasy that many women are waiting for and i enjoyed reading how love could be really painful here on earth."
2,A frustrating read,"Some reviewers seem to hate this book for stealing the plot of Wuthering Heights. I, never having read Wuthering Heights (and now confused about whether I should bother), still disliked this book. I generally disliked many of the characters and the choices they made, and I won't rave about Alice Hoffman's writing style, though it is difficult to put my finger on what exactly bothered me. Perhaps the author was trying to prove a point about obsessive love, but characters' behavior seemed to change too abruptly. I knew early on that the book would only frustrate me, but the story was captivating enough to keep me reading. The end wasn't so bad, but getting there was painful. I'm sure others will enjoy this book -- to each his own -- but I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Truly Terrible,"This book is awful. As previous reviewers have said, it takes a great writer to write in the present tense, and Alice Hoffman is not such a writer. The writing is also cliche-ed, and worse, is trying to be grandiose and literary, while falling flat. I found I didn't care about the characters, nor did I find them believable. I only finished the book because it is an incredibly quick read, and because I wanted to know whether it ever improved. I feel like Hoffman didn't feel like writing any more after 275 pages, so she tacked on the neatest ending. Don't bother to buy it."
2,"Dark, haunting, twisted, and dissapointing","This book started out OK, then got mildly interesting, but from page 64 (in the attic w/ Hollis) on it just got worse and worse. Who wants to read about characters who are totally irrational though they act normal,and make bad decisions. I just wanted to yell at March every time she went crawling back to Hollis. It's a book of addictions. Alan is addicted to alcohol, March is addicted to Hollis, Hollis is addicted to sex, watching people through windows, and being in control."
2,Wuthering Heights is a better story!,"It came as a great relief to me to look through the other customer comments and see that I am not the only one who saw the striking similarities to Wuthering Heights. I counted at least 12 basic plot lines that parallel WH. The major differences betweent the two books is that WH is much better written. The characters are developed in greater depth and there's more thought given to the story. Also, in WH the heroine is attracted to and destroyed by her lover, but for reasons more substantial than just sex. It struck me as completely unbelievable that a woman who was supposed to be as strong and intelligent as March could become a blithering idiot because a guy was good in bed. If you want a great tale of a mutually destructive relationship, which negatively impacts the lives of many, read Wuthering Heights. Here on Earth is much easier to read, but put in the extra effort and read the ""original"". It's worth the work."
2,Very difficult to read,"I am sure that the plot, content, and outcome of this book are very good, BUT trying to read a book written in the present tense is very difficult for me. I am having the toughest time getting through it! I have seen it pop up on all kinds of ""recommended"" book lists, but the tense in which it is written overides any desire to finish it."
2,Need a Nap?,"I found this book to be especially boring until it takes off in Part 3. The first 2 parts definitely could have been condensed with a little more action to hook the reader in. I do not recommend this book to anyone unless you want to be bored, frusterated at March's stupidity, and left with an overall depressed feeling."
3,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.,I liked reading this book but just was not all that pleased at the end. It was kind of strange.
2,Not an original work,"I'm glad to see that several others agree with me...Hoffman needs to credit Bronte for the plot and characters! As soon as Hollis comes to live with the Murray family, it is obvious that this book is a shamless knock-off of Wuthering Heights. It's not the worst book I ever read, but if you haven't read Wuthering Heights, do yourself a favor and read it!! It's time better spent."
2,Wuthering Heights redone,Has anyone else noticed that this book is a copy of the Wuthering Heights storyline but turning Healthcliff into a wife beater? Very inconsistant characters and a real rip off of the original. Just read the original again-or for the first time if you haven't read it yet-
5,Don't listen!,"Don't listen to the people who didn't like this book :) I absolutely adored it, and I've read so much that it's rare tha I come across a book I truly love. This is definitely my favorite book of the last 5 years; it's original, moving, and vibrant. If you only ever read one of Alice Hoffman's books (read them all! ), make it this one."
1,Just say no to Ms. Hoffman........,"This book was not up to Ms. Hoffman's usual standards. Beyond that, I am becoming more and more disenchanted with Oprah's selections. They are all about women who have horrendous problems and hardships and in some cases, I find I'm mostly tired rather than entertained when I read them. The other reader's references to Wuthering Heights is accurate and was done much better by Ms, Bronte. I think I'll do my own book choices from now on - after ""She's Come Undone"" and now this newest Oprah selection, I'm convinced I'll come undone if I keep reading this ""Oprah Show-type"" tragedy and drivel. Skip this book!"
2,depressing.......,"I thought this book was pretty well-written, but the subject matter was depressing and very sad, and the characters unlikable. It gave me an uncomfortable and somewhat disgusting feeling after reading it, which stayed with me through to the next day. Also, I found it kind of odd that every one in the book was beautiful, handsome and/or had been in their youth. Not my kind of story!"
2,Adaptation or Theft,"This isn't an adaptation of Bronte's Wuthering Heights, it's a mugging of it. The author has stolen bronte's story and moved it from the Moors to Massachusetts. I find it very difficult to get past this. Especially when, having enjoyed Wuthering Heights so many times, I already know how the story will unfold. Very disappointing."
4,Rediscovered love,"Spellbinding book about lost love re-discovered and the hell that creeps into relationships. I hung on every word, would have read it cover to cover if given a chance. March Murray returns to her hometown for a funeral and has her life turned upside down when she encounters Hollis, her long lost love. Daughter Gwen finds love and a deeper sense of self when she meets Hank, her first cousin and Tarot, a horse."
2,"Horrible Characters, Cheap Plot","I've read a lot of Alice Hoffman. Her characters are usually real people, with flaws and beauty. This woman though, this main character March, is an utter unfeeling idiot. There really isn't anything redeemable about her. Sure she doesn't end up with the one-dimensional psychopath she professes to have a deep love for, which is you know, great, but the only REAL reason is that he dies.The plot itself is, as the author admits, a takeoff of Bronte's Wuthering Heights. Fine. Okay. Wuthering Heights is about a complicated relationship between two tragic people. This relationship? Is about two sort of stock characters with little to no depth and their pretty simple relationship of abuser and victim.The book basically makes no sense and you hate the characters.The only redeeming part is that the language and imagery is nice, as per usual.Ms. Hoffman really did herself a disfavor with this one."
2,Downright depressing.,"I struggled through the last 200 pages of this book. The first part of the story was good but towards the end the book lost my interest. The charactors were alright but sometimes they were very predictable. My favorite charactor would have to be Gwen. She was strong and knew what she wanted to do. My least favorite charactor had to be March. She was weak in her ways and became more through out the book. This is one of those books I would never read again. I Am sure a lot of people enjoyed the book, but for me I didn't."
3,just plain dark,"I'd give this a 1 for character development, but a 5 for writing style, so it averages to a three.Hoffman writes her characters beautifully -- I felt as though I was inside March, and I despised Hollis. I particularly felt akin to Gwen, because she is the character I understood the most. However, she was the only character I understood. II wished I had known more about March and Hollis when they were younger, then maybe I'd understand who they were when the novel begins. Since I didn't, I felt like I was simply observing these sad, morose creatures completely screw up their lives. And since I didn't know why, I felt very unsymathetic towards them. And therefore, I just couldn't enjoy the book."
2,a disappointment,"...I found Hoffman's characters to be unlikable, as well as inconsistent. The use of the word ""f***"" throughout the book did much to give me a feel (as well as some nausea) for the heartlessness of hero/villain, Hollis, but when the word came in the voice of the heroine..., March, it rang opposite her romanticized view of her relationship with Hollis. ...I didn't have any sympathy for Hollis, where I fell in love with Heathcliff. And no character in ""Here On Earth"" seems to be better off in the end for having made it through the novel. Many relationships severed, but few lessons learned..."
4,Realistic heart-breaker,This book revealed a very poignant life of a young woman as she overcomes the obstacles before her. It was definitely not uplifting. . .but was inspiring. It really makes you feel like your life really isn't that bad.
4,March Murray is a little bit of all of us.,"March Murray reminds us all of the vulnerability of our emotions. Alice Hoffman takes us on a journey of choices, and chooses for us the ones we probably would have chosen if we were March, and haven't we all been at some time? Read the book and find out."
1,WET TEABAG DUD!!!,"All that the naive teenager went through to get over Hollis the first time should've made March a wise, adult woman. Remembering how toxic Hollis had been then and knowing how dangerous Hollis was now, for 38(?) year-old March to fly back to his wretched clutches, in the face of an enviable husband and supportive friends was not merely disappointing, but utterly perplexing.Gwen's storyline redeems this to a one-star read.Had Hoffman put in even a minimal effort, this might've been a decent book."
3,Dissapointing ending,"All throughout the book, I was wondering why the author wouldn't allow to go a little deeper into each character. The beginning all the way through the middle of the book was interesting and ""made sense"". Then, it went downhill,it felt like the author just wanted to get it done. Every time something was happening, it felt like she was changing the subject instead of elaboring it. I was hooked all the way to the end, but was very dissapointed with the last 10 pages. We don't know if Richard took March back, we don't know what happened to Gwen. The author left us with many questions unanswered. The book could have been more developed, in many areas."
3,Interesting story - poorly developed characters,"I bought this book because I loved Wuthering Heights and was interested in a modern interpretation of the story. For all you Bronte fans out there - DONT DO IT! The plot is melodramatic, even ridiculous in Hoffman's hands.I don't mind that the characters in this book were not likeable, but it does bother me that they were unbelievable.That said, once I got past my initial disappointment, I found the book moderately interesting. If your expectations are not too high, this is an easy, enjoyable read."
2,Read Wuthering Heights instead.,"It appears Alice Hamilton must have enjoyed Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. This book is obviously similar with a few sex scenes added to please the 1990's crowd. Hollis is similar to Heathcliff, March is a parallel to both Catherines, and Hank and Hareton are also identical. Hollis is the abandoned orphan brought home by the wealthy family. The oldest son, like Hindley Earnshaw in Wuthering Heights, is jealous and cruel. March Murray can't settle her reason and passion conflict and her daughter is even involved in a first cousin love affair. Unlike Emily Bronte, Alice Hamilton cheapens the novel with trashy sex scenes and downplays the institution of marriage. For those who are conscious of grammar, Hamilton's use of ""you"" is especially irritating."
1,This book STINKS!,"Actually, I would prefer to give this book no stars as it deserves none. I hated this book. I could not relate to nor feel sorry for any of the characters. The way March let Hollis manipulate her was pathetic beyond words. A friend lent me this book as she enjoyed it and thought I would too. All I can say is Thank God I was not the one to spend money on this book. Shame on Oprah for making such a foolish choice and shame on the author for wasting paper on such a rotten book."
3,Hello....Have you ever heard of Wuthering Heights?????,"I beleive Alice Hoffman to be a great writer, but with this novel, she is simply affirming her ability to bring a classic into modern-day literature. This book would be excellent if you have no desire to read period peices and you need to do a book report on Wuthering Heights, but for the avid reader it is merely a forgery.I could write great novels too, if I stole ideas from classics. Maybe this week I'll write an updated version of Great Expectations and pawn it off as an original."
5,A book that keeps you on the edge of your seat!,"When March and her daughter Gwen go back to March's old home town for a funeral, March find her old mean boyfriend Hollis and falls in love with him again. While Gwen falls in love with her cousin Hank!"
3,well-written but depressing!,"I didn't get what happened: initially it seemed to be an okay plot, but then it twisted and turned and it was about abuse ( i think)... It was depressing, and i really didn't enjoy it too much toward the end."
3,I highly recomend it!,"I read this book because of a high school class, and I think that Alice Hoffman is a great fiction author. She uses what seems to be real life people in a real life situation. I recommend everyone to read it."
1,A BIG Disappointment,"I was looking forward to reading this novel. I'm so sorry I wasted good money on it. Although the words themselves were well chosen, somehow I never got really interested in the characters. I could not sympathize with any of them and frankly, didn't care what happened to them.In the end, I finished the book because I figured it might improve. Unfortunately I was wrong.The messages of addiction, self-hatred and self-indulgence were disturbing and twisted. I saw no redeeming value in this book. I gave it away to the library because I didn't want it around."
2,Wish I'd skipped this one,"I tried this book because I loved Practical Magic. Here on Earth was so dark. The cast of characters were all miserably unhappy, twisted, and wounded. There was no humor or joy. Every major relationship in the book was flawed and pathetic. I found little to like about this book other than Hoffman's story telling abilities."
2,The least appealing Hoffman book,"I have enjoyed many other books by Alice Hoffman. This one is terrible. The writing is overstated and the chracters and plot too extreme. I would recomment ""Practical Magic"" , ""At Risk"", or ""Turtle Moon"" as much better Hoffman works."
1,Disappointed!,"I couldn't wait to read Here on Earth after having read several of Hoffman's other books. Boy, was I ever disappointed to find I knew what was coming at every turn of the page at the start of the book. It was as if I were rereading Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte -- just different names (although Hollis and Heathcliff do start with the same letter and both housekeepers last names started with D!), a different setting, and a different time -- too many similarities for me to overlook. How disappointing! I didn't even take the time to finish the book."
4,Ending doesnt leave loose ends,"The book ends at a natural place and doesn:t leave loose ends. The book was about the relationship between Hollis and March, and it naturally ends with the end of that relationship."
3,A disturbing look into the soul when it comes to love..,"This is certainly not Alice Hoffman's best, but it as true to how love can take over a person's better judgement, and if you have ever been sick in love, you will relate to this book. Tragic love story..."
3,greatly disappointed,"I looked forward to reading Here on Earth, because I had so enjoyed Hoffman's previous novels. Part of the enticement to continue reading a book, however, is an identification with the characters. In this case, there wasn't any. I kept on waiting for a sympathetic attachment to March, Gwen, Hank, Alan or Richard. There was none forthcoming. Instead, I kept on wishing they would use their native intelligence, rather than pure emotion (or in Hoffman's world, the scent or essence of emotion). I actually kept on reading just to see if they would come to their senses!! I was keenly disappointed, and in the end, their fates did not concern me. That is the ultimate failure of the novel."
1,hated it,What a waste of time this was. Probably a waste of talent on her part too. I seem to remember her as a good writer. I would never have finished this book if I didn't think I needed it for my thesis. The characters were totally un-likable and the situations they let themselves in for were ridiculous. If I knew anyone like them I sure wouldn't have anything to do with them - which leaves very little reason for reading the book.
2,If you want to read this book......,save yourself some time and money and just read the summary at the beginning of this web page....It doesn't have much more to it than that.
4,Good writing...but inconsistent characters,"Here on Earth is a richly written novel. The book quickly takes you into its world and keeps you occuppied. Character development is rapid and transitions are smooth. Some of the flaws that are difficult to overlook left me distracted. The town's newspaper journalist, Susie Justice, seemed always the last to know the news of the town. In a town that small, she's clearly in the wrong profession. Also, the main character, March and her daughter Gwen, made some very out-of-character decisions which again, distracted from the richness of the story. Though the juxtoposition of the two character's role reversal is apparent, neither character has very strong convictions which makes the transition hard to believe. Overall, I think the book is worth the read and I really enjoyed the writing."
3,"great beginnig, dissapointing ending!","Alice Hoffman has a great style and prose, but I think she let go of the elements of her characters. They are very convincing in the beginning and by the end, you just cannot trust them anymore. I think she was afraid of the ending and she changed the characters in a not beleivable way. When I close the book I felt cheated. She gave us clues through out the book as to what to expect and at the end and, she didn't deliver. That's why I think many people didn't like this book. Practical magic was much better. It was magical!"
5,A Story We Can All Identify With,"This was one of the best books that I have read in some time! There are a few pages which are a little vague and require a second reading. There is also some language used that I do not particularly like to see. But the meaning rings through is loud and clear. Each one of us has had a relationship that was all consuming, but many of us never dare to think of what would happen if given a second chance. Very realistic!"
1,Very disappointed,"I have been an Alice Hoffman fan for years and found her books to be insightful and gripping. I, however, found 'Here on Earth' to be a trashy novel with weak characters. March was pathetic, and it angered me as the book progressed through her abuse by Hollis and finally her daughter. March watched a man strike her own child and did nothing. This novel is not based on love for a man, but selfishness of a woman who cares nothing for her 14 year old daughter and husband. I found her character revolting and offensive. I think this book is terrible, in addition to being a total rip off of Wuthering Heights."
3,"Good, but not Great","This book is too much like ""Wuthering Heights"" to be taken seriously. Change the time period and the characters names, and it's Bonte's novel. It's good, but certainly not the best I've read."
2,An unreal and boring story,"I found this book to be so unreal and unbelievable that it was hard for me to relate to the story. I felt detatched from the characters and even bored at times. I also thought the main character was a poor representation of a woman, especially in her regard for her daughter."
5,Picks up Where Bronte Failed,"Erotic and lusty, this book was more detailed and beautiful to read. The love was so powerful, that it hurt. Very true to the tale story."
2,Eh..,"This book came highly recommended, and I ended up highly dissapointed. The characters were uniformly unsympathetic, the plot, while compelling was mired in inessential description and a subtle undercurrent of moralizaiton."
4,"This is a 90's version of ""Wuthering Heights"".","I had ""deja vu"" reading this book - it really does read like a modern version of ""Wuthering Heights&quot. Still, it's a terrific read, as are all of Alice Hoffman's novels. END"
3,"Hang in there, folks!","I agree with the other reviewers that as a whole, March's behavior once she hooked up with Hollis was really sad, crazy and hard to read (especially how she turned away from protecting her daughter). But I've now read 2 other Hoffman books, ""Second Nature"" and ""7th Heaven"", and these gave me more insight into March. In both of the other books, there's a female main character whose behavior at times seems immature, irresponsible and downright disgusting, and yet, I think that there are parts of these women in each of us. It's as if Hoffman wants her readers to see ALL of the parts (the dark ones included) we each have inside of us. So my advice is to keep reading her books with this in mind."
2,Didn't care for this one,This book was the first by Alice Hoffman I read. I was disappointed by it. It took me months to finish reading it because I couldn't bear to see what March was to do next. Hopefully the next Alice Hoffman book I read won't be this bad.
2,"Letdown in L.A. , expected more","I watched the episode in which Oprah sat down with Alice Hoffman and the others and could not wait to run out and purchase this book. What a letdown. The characters are so depressing that I didn't find anyone that I really cared about at all. I kept waiting for the big turn around, hoping that it would change my opinion of this novel, but unfortunately it never came."
1,Worst book I ever read,"I read this book because it was recommended by Oprah, but I have never disliked a book more. I couldn't wait to get rid of it. The characters are both so needy. Hollis has no redeeming qualities and why March wanted to stay with him is beyond me. He not only treated her poorly, but she allowed that treatment to carry over to her daughter without even noticing. I find it hard to believe anyone could be this oblivious to life around them. Yes, love can sometimes make you blind, but it is not romantic or beautiful when it causes you to cease being human. March gave up her whole life for a worthless man. My recommendation is to never, ever read this book."
3,"Great story, highly developed interesting characters","Mediocre writing, wonderfully developed characters. I thought the writing was a little bland, but I loved the way Hoffman developed the characters in the story. By the end of the novel, the reader feels completely different about the main characters than at the beginning..... GREAT story-telling."
1,Hated This Book,"Boy oh boy. Seems like everything I read these days on Oprah's approved reading list is depressing. This book is no exception. Maybe I just like a little happiness in my books because this one did nothing but drag me down. The characters left much to the imagination, since the author's style apparently doesn't fill in a lot of the blanks there. One-dimensional cardboard stereotypical characters and misery is all I got out of this read. Tired of reading about hopelessness, cruelty and despair with no redemption at the end."
3,Wuthering Heights Rip Off,It seems to me that she took her story out of Wuthering Heights. I don't see any creativity on that.
4,A study in the hypnotic power of obsessive love,"It's hard to find any heroic figures in this dark romance. Everyone's been hurt, most have hurt others, all find sound judgment a rare commodity. The closest are the most unlikely, a cowardly drunk who helps to save an old racehorse, his niece whose rebellious ways are shed n favor of developing a clear but sad perspective on things like family, responsibility, and love. One central character is controlling and cruel to the core, another nearly loses her hold on reality by yielding to the seductive power of an old, ill-advised, once lost love. The detachment of her scientist husband is painful, and equally so the judgmental meddling of her closest friend.There are good, kind, and stable folks in the story as well, but even they seem to be troubled by ghosts from the past. A fascinating tale of the damage done by obsessive love, marking everyone within range, with only glimmers of redemption to come."
5,Couldn't put it down,"When I first starting reading this book, I thought, ""Okay this is going to be grueling."" It turns out that the book was fantastic. I absolutely could not put it down. The events in this book are somewhat ficticous, but some of them really occur in everyday life. It shocked me when Hollis and his high school sweetheart got back together. It was even more surprising when they kept talking about his ex-wife and how she passed away. What aggravated me the most about the mother was that she allowed her daughter to date her close cousin and allow herself to cheat on her faithful husband while he was in another state. I was very happy with the ending and am glad the lady made the decision she made. Things like this happen every day, some woman sometimes don't have the courage to face their problems."
1,I guess if this were really the worst book in the world....,"I wouldn't have been so disgusted with the character of March. I mean, disgust IS an emotion, right? So I guess I can say that my emotions were stirred by this book.So if you want to be disgusted by the portrayal of one super-duper huge loser named March, you should definately read this book."
3,Jill's Thought,"First of all, things I like about this book. I like the Reunion between Hollis and March In which March returns For the funeral of judith and find's her Lost love! Next I also like the blind love shared between Gwen and Hank upon discovering that they are actually related. And i thought it was even more touching in the way that they met, this being the stubborn horse tamed by the gentleness of Gwen. Now, things that I dont like about the book. I dont like the lieing of March and Gwen in which they with held information from Richard about March's cheating! Finally, i think the blatent and repetetive swearing in which the author uses to explain many points is completely unneccesary and frankly tasteless! She could have used better words to make the same point, and the repetiveness of the dialogue makes it confusing!"
1,Awful!,One of the worst books I have ever read. This book is just a recycled version of Wuthering Heights. I struggled just to finish this boring and bland novel. Please save your money.
4,A Very Sad Story...,This book brought back so many memories for me. At 15 my friend was psycologically and physically abused by his father. We became very close because I felt the need to protect him and be there for him like March did with Hollis. It was a friendship that developed into romance eventually. He went into the marines when he was 19 and I went off to college. We wrote off and on but eventually quit. I have always wondered what would have happened if we would have gotten back together and I think this book may have answered all my questions. I think it is best to leave the past in the past and go on with your life!
1,"Read the Original ""Wuthering Heights""","Will someone please tell me...was this meant to be a retelling of Bronte's ""Wuthering Heights?"" If it is, the writing isn't even close to the quality of the original. I've looked everywhere in this book for some credit to be giving to Bronte for this story, since almost every last detail is the same, but I can't find any. Did Alice Hoffman have a mental lapse and not know she was copying someone else's story? Aren't there copywrite laws? It's past ridiculous. Don't bother...skip this one and read the original."
2,Un-magnificent obsession,"This is a depressing and, ultimately, disappointing story. Hollis borders on the satanic with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. We at least understand why he has to control March; we have no idea what March sees in him. And worst of all, the story builds to a climax that never really happens. If you want to read a good Alice Hoffman book try Practical Magic or Seventh Heaven but don't waste your time on this one."
2,come down to earth,"I could not believe Alice Hoffman's unoriginal retelling of Wuthering Heights, which is basically all this book amounts too. The theme has been done... and done considerably better than this superfluous attempt. Not only is the use of present tense extremely annoying, but the way Hollis obtained March's and Allan's land was unbelievable. It was a fact that women could not own their own land when Heathcliffe took Earnshaw's property in WH; however, in Here on Earth, it is unbelievable that a lawyer would not think to rewrite his own will after his daughter was born and certainly after his wife died. I was shocked to see that Michael Douglas (who does he see himself as: Hollis?) had bought the rights to the book... jeez, look out for another Hope Floats soon."
2,Wuthering Heights? hmmm....,"I started the book and within minutes of reading picked up on the fact that I was reading a basic synopsis of Wuthering Heights. It confused me, so I went to reviews and summaries and could not find that fact discussed? Adaptations are alright and can be explored beautifully, but there should be disclosure. The cover and write-ups about this book fail to do so. That makes it all a bit fishy to me in terms of the authors intention."
4,Read it,"This is a good book. Although it has usage of bad words, which at some points are not needed, this is an interesting book. This book is a rather compassionate book which, I think, should only be read by elder people and elder teenage kids. This is a great story which deals with things that may even happen in real life. This book is a strong one because it deals with real life happenings. I encourage all ages of viewers to read this book. Especially ones who love books with deep and compassionate stories to them. This may have bad language where not need but it has great story line to it."
2,Such unappealing characters I just couldn't care,"Not bad writing, but I just couldn't care about either of the main characters. I kept thinking, ""grow up and get over it already."" The secondary characters were more interesting and seemed to have more subtle nuanced relationships -- a book about them would have been more interesting."
1,B-o-r-i-n-g!,"I came across this book at a garage sale, and because it said it was one of Oprah's Book Club selections, I couldnt wait to read it. Ugh. I struggled through, and thought it was the worst thing I've ever read. The whole concept was boring, the writing was boring, and I'd say...'dont bother'. I am one that has to finish something once started..so this was torture. I kept thinking that its going to get better, and the only halfway decent part was at the very end. I thought this story was most unbelievable. Dont waste your time and money!"
2,Perhaps a more apt title would be: What On Earth?!?,"I survived reading about four chapters before I couldn't take it any more! I bailed out just before March and the towns folk of Jenkintown gathered for the housekeeper's funeral. (see? I can't even remember that woman's name) The characters were so polarized. Hollis was the mean, evil, brooding forsaken lover, a loner... The housekeeper was just so ""good good good"" it was not believable. I was vistiting a nursing home today and decided on the spot to get rid of the book, I left on the reading table."
2,Yuck,"Again, I read many of the reviews posted here before I decided to read this book. Many people wrote about this wonderful love between Hollis and March. Are you out of your mind? That's not love! It's some sick obsession these two have for each other. I'm very disappointed with Here on Earth. So disappointed that I don't know if I can finish the thing. It just makes me angry to read it. Not because it's striking a nerve or anything that deep. The story is just plain stupid and unbelievable. There's nothing endearing about this novel. Someone used the term ""sleaze"" and I find it very descriptive. Big news flash, ladies....sex and love are not one and the same!"
2,Style: Intriguing - Plot: Tragedy of the Week,"The style is intriguing as perspective and characters change mid-paragraph. But the tale itself fizzles after a promising start. In the begining March and Hollis' love was tragic, but by the end it was pathetic - not something I wanted to read any more about.I have read that Michael Douglas has purchased the movie rights to this book - I hope he won't venture to anything larger than the small screen.The book did not insight me to read another Hoffman title."
1,How disappointing!!,"What starts out as a pretty good read soon turns to sleaze when the main character, March Murray, gives up her marriage to return to the arms of her past teen lover - her foster brother! The sleaze spreads when March does nothing to discourage her daughter's budding romance with the girl's first cousin!! I've enjoyed other Hoffman novels, but this one is a disappointment. And what was Oprah thinking?"
2,Incredibly Irritating,"Anything I have to say has already been said. I'm so tired of reading Oprah books whose main characters have no redeeming qualities. Even Hank, the ""nicest"" guy in the book, doesn't realize how badly Hollis treats him. You would think Hollis is the embodiment of Satan the way he just sucks everyone in despite treating each and every one of them like doggy-doo-doo.Additionally, I began counting how many times one of the characters referred to ""smelling like anger"" or ""the scent of fury"" or how someone ""smelled like fire"" after sex. I got the feeling some professor must have written ""nice imagery!"" in red on some creative writing paper long ago and Hoffman's decided to stick with what worked.The only reason I gave this book 4 points is that I was able to finish it in spite of disliking it so intensely...but it's possible that's only a tribute to its relative brevity (as opposed to Wally Lamb's 465 page monster)."
2,disturbing,"i picked up this book because i watch Oprahs show daily and i thought it would probably be a very interesting book. I must say i felt quite sick reading it based on the fact of alot of swearing, and things that don't really happen in everyday life if it does happen every day then we must live in a very SICK world. I'm afraid I probably won't buy another Oprah book club book again!! is it any wonder our world is in a sorry state. I think Oprah should vet these books properly, I mean what if a younger girl were to read this book, do we want that for our younger generation, for them to know such words. Our young children are supposed to learn from and respect their elders, how can they with these books around??"
2,Too Dark!,I took this book on vacation. What a poor choice! The whole book is just too dark. I cannot imagine a woman like March letting a piece of trash like Hollis totally dominate her life and I cannot imagine a mother who would let her daughter act the way she does. A very depressing book!
2,A very disappointing book!,"I had high hopes for ""Here On Earth."" It is an Oprah's Book Club Selection and received praise from the Washington Post Book World, and The New Yorker (to name two). I found the characters to be unbelievable and underdeveloped. I didn't have a clear picture of who March,the main character, was. What motivated her? What kind of person was she? What did she think and feel? I found myself sympathizing with the horse, Tarot, more than with the human characters. I was annoyed with the dialogue. I found it to be trite, and unreal. Some of the responses by adult characters were so immature that I would expect to hear them spoken by sarcastic teenagers. I thought the plot was simple and only mildly enjoyable. I was somewhat curious as to how the conflict would be resolved, and this motivated me to read the book through to the end. I give ""Here on Earth,"" a somewhat generous 2 stars."
1,Is Zero Stars possible?,"Man, this was one terrible book. I can't believe Oprah let this book be publicized. I have loved all the other books she recommends... But this was just Wuthering Heights made even more boring. Too bad... I wasted my money..."
2,"Hoffman, what happened?","I loved ""Practical Magic"" and ""Turtle Moon"", but this book was such a disappointment. Nothing about how March reacted to Hollis made any sense, beyond her girlhood dreams about what might-have-been. If he'd been waiting for her all his life, he had a funny way of showing it. And nothing that we knew about March would prepare us for how downright silly she is. The man is an abusive creep!Some of the writing was her usual wonderful(The entire first chapter, for example), but I never got over the Kathy/Heathcliff/Wuthering Heights story. There was something ridiculous about them, too. Way too much melodrama, not enough insight."
4,I need a sequel,"I picked up a copy of this book while on vacation, at an airport shop with a very limited selection. I didn't expect to like it, but I honestly could not put it down. I was, however, dissapointed in the ending. Did March return to Richard? Would he actually take her back? Could she and her daughter ever again have a parent-child relationship?"
5,Powerful and Complex Tale; Disliked Hollis and March,"Hollis and March are two of the most pitiful and pathetic characters I have ever read. Hollis was a nice lover for March, until he turned greedy, rich, and rude. March was headstrong, but was weak and always followed Hollis. The wonder of this story was March's daughter, who was working with her own problems of love, just like how her mother did years ago and still is now.Timeful and captive tale, complex and a horror to read, but satisfying in the end. One great Oprah pick, I love Alice Hoffman now."
2,"I read the whole thing, but now I wonder why.",A sad story about some sick people who need some serious counseling or more!
5,Deep and Sensual,"I thought this was a wonderful novel. It was hard to get into at first because I kept looking for a deeper meaning then what was really there. You really shouldn't look for the meanings of the novel until the end, otherwise you miss important concepts.Hoffman was trying to show her reader's that loveis unidentified to the characters. The author didn't make that an easy task to understand, but that's why I loved the novel. It was such a challenge and at the end, when you realize what happened throughout the entire novel you felt rewarded."
2,Heathcliff (I mean Hollis) was a loser,"While I've always found this Wuthering story to be an interesting one, I'm afraid I found it a bit cartoonish and ultimately unbelievable. Also I hated the (no pay off) ending since it seemed more like a plug being pulled. So Hank gives everything away and doesn't even try to to help his dad or Tarot. I don't think so."
2,Disappointed,"I love Alice Hoffman's work, but I was very disappointed with this one. It was handled so much better by Emily Bronte (Wuthering Heights). Next time I'll borrow the book from the library before I buy it."
4,Are you crazy?,"Are you crazy? That is the question I'd like to ask all of the people who gave Here On Earth a bad review! I will admit that I did not give the book 5 stars because the beginning of the book was a little hard to get into. I read approx. 30 pages and then put the book down for about 3 months. I then started reading it again and was pleasently surprised when I could not put the book down. I read the remainder of the book in less than 2 days. Alice Hoffman did a wonderful job expressing the needs and desires of the characters. Chapter after chapter I was left wanting more. I will also admit that I wanted to know what happened to all of the characters at the end of the book, but I also wished that it had not ended. Don't listen to all of those who have ripped on the book. This is second book that I have read by Alice Hoffman and I am looking forward to starting my third! Oprah knew what a great book this was when she added it to her book club."
4,not bad,"Pretty intrresting read, not the best book ive ever read... but not a dissapointment either! Hollis is defenitely a very interesting and deep character."
2,romance novel,"This book was OK to pass the time on a long boring flight. If you like ""romance novels"" you may like this."
1,A waste of time,"This book was terrible! Pretty language disguises a book with no substance. The ending is a let-down. We never find out what happened to the people we are supposed to care about... we never learn why the main characters really behaved they way they did... and any book with the ""f"" word in it used to describe the act, is really just trying to be soft porn. Don't waste your time on this book! I haven't been this aggrevated by a book in a long time. It started out with such promise too...."
3,Big disappointment,"I got about halfway through this book when I simply couldn't take it anymore and started leafing through till the end. I was glad I hadn't taken the time to read all the way through. I found the characters to be extremeley one-dimensional and felt no compassion for them. Hollis was a complete jerk, infatuation or not. Some sort of background on March's marriage to Richard was completely lacking, and then to top it all off, there was no conclusion for March or Gwen. I gave three stars since I thought the style of writing was good, but the characters were so weak, they definitely needed much more depth and substance."
1,Weak attempt,"This novel started out well, but halfway through degenerated into cheap romance, cliched writing, and a plotline straight out of a soap opera. I found myself unable to care about any of the characters or what happened to them. Hoffman insisted on telling us, rather than showing, the important details, a device which greatly weakens any writing. Oprah struck out on this one."
2,A disappointingly empty examination of the facets of love,"Hollis is Heathcliff for the 90's? What a tragic comparison. Hollis is a violent sexual preditor and a murderer. March, an otherwise accomplished and cherished wife and mother becomes a helpless victim under this charmless brute's spell. I kept waiting for March to wake up and defend Gwen, but she displayed only limp disregard. The end of the story fizzled out, concluding too neatly, in a unsatisfying, unlikely way that left too many questions unanswered. Not one of Ms. Hoffman's best. Also, while the writing style itself was evocative of the cold, frozen emotions of the past, Ms. Hoffman used too many similies and metaphors; left the story laden."
1,I thought it was going to be a romantic love story.,I was rather depressed after reading this story. I can't believe that Oprah recommended this book. I kept hoping that March would wake up and go back to her husband. I thoughtthe book might get better at the end but it didn't. I wish I had never read it.
2,Bad made for tv story line,"This is not a romantic story about passionate love. It's a story about stupidity, lust, and selfishness. It's disgraceful how most of the women in this novel are portrayed, giving up their lives, their selves, and their sense for a smile, a kiss, a touch, or just hard sex. I can't believe Oprah took her audiences down to this level after elevating them in Paradise."
2,An o.k. read but not Alice Hoffman at her best,"I was very excited about this novel especially since it was an Oprah pick. However, I was disappointed by the book. I did not relate to the main character's attraction to a very cold and sick man. There was nothing redeeming about the story, perhaps because I expected so much from the author. I liked Practical Magic much better. If you want to read Alice Hoffman read Practical Magic and skip this one. It really wasn't worth it."
4,"Loved the book, but not the ending","I happen to be a real ""book snob"" and I was surprised that I liked this book so much after reading some of the reviews, but then when I noticed one reviewer that hated it had been very emotional of ""the Bridges of Madison County"" I had to laugh. (Speaking of pure drivel and a waste of time). What I liked most about this book was the atmosphere that was protrayed, the New England autumn and early winter were so much a part of the story. I was not crazy about the ending, however, she really left us hanging. I really would have liked to have known what happened to Gwen, although I did feel as though she had been transformed during her stay in Massachusetts and would go back to California with self-respect, something she had clearly been lacking. Also, March was one lousy mother!"
3,"Intriquing, but.....","I was drawn very much into the book for several reasons; however, was sorely dissappointed at the end .In the beginning, the story was contagious. It was such a teaser.I kept anticipating that any one of the characters would leap off the pages and do something that would surprise me, but they all lacked some zing, nor did I have sympathy for any of them. I must say that I was most dissappointed with the conclusion. It started to lead to a big ending with the possiblilty of a huge surprising twist, but it failed to do so. I kept thinking that somewhere near the end of the book the characters and the story are going to come together, but it never did."
2,Nothing special,"I found this book enjoyable at the beginning. However, the relationship between March and Hollis was not sufficiently developed. Additionally, the author's treatment of Gwen's relationship with her cousin was distracting. Luckily, it only took me two days to read."
1,A true disapointment,"I was really looking forward to this book but boy what a disappointment. The characters are a joke and although the basic idea for the plot is good, how it is developed is very poor. Also, the characters are inconsistent. For example, the author depicts the beloved housekeeper as a Madonna like figure. Yet, we find a very contradictory descriptionn a few pages later - she was a busybody. Well which one is it? A busybody or the all nuturing mother figure.I can't even bring myself to finishing this book. It is a complete disappointment."
1,An item of interest...,"Although I have not yet read this novel, my interest has been piqued. It is currently being made into a movie, and the film crew is working on the project this week in my neighborhood, on Summit Avenue in St. Paul next to the University Club. Word from a crew member is that the script barely resembles the book though. Thought you readers might like to know... If you live in the area, it might be worth checking out!"
1,My strongest reaction to the book was its lack of ethics.,"The book was ""Wuthering Heights,"" and it was fairly distressing that an author could use the story line without crediting the original author. I would have enjoyed her variation, but was too 'haunted' by the author's lack of ethics. Did those who disagree really read Wuthering Heights?"
5,"Sensual, disturbing, and exquisitely written.","I must admit to a certain amount of shellshock from having just finished this book. I thought it was a capitivating and moving story, but I guess what surprised me is that it became a totally different book than I thought it was going to be. There were times in the last quarter of the book when I had a physical reaction to the events unfolding on the page. I don't agree that this book is depressing; yes, my heart hurt with sadness at how March's life had gone awry, but I don't see that as the same thing as being depressed by it (at least not to the degree of some of Oprah's earlier book choices."
4,This is one of Alice Hoffman's best books.,"I have read quite a few of Hoffman's books, and always find her writing engaging and her sense of the magical transporting. Here on Earth is perhaps less magical than some of her other books, but the plot is more engaging. The tale of an all-encompassing, but self-destructive love is fascinating, as are the mother-daughter themes. Alice Hoffman is one of the best authors now writing, yet is often underrated."
1,I thought the character's and the storyline very disturbing.,"I thought the story line was very disturbing and the character's. Is it just me or does anybody else recognize the adultry that March was committing with Hollis? if they were so much in love no way would she have married another man (True Love can stand the test of time), I thought it was tasteless on the daughter's part to fall for her cousin (which by the way she was informed of who he was), I just can't believe people find adultry romantic it reminds me of another story (Bridges of Madison County). I am a happily married woman and I would not willing commit adulty, shame on Oprah if she and Stedman were married this book would have not been picked by the famous book club."
2,depressing!,"By the end of the novel, i was depressed and couldn't have cared less about March and her miserable life. She was a selfish and immature person- a negligent mother and a terrible wife. Had this been a true story, she her husband and her daughter would have wound up in therapy for the remainder of their lives. I would have been better off (and more entertained) had i opted to watch an episode of Jerry Springer instead!"
3,Wuthering Heights for sure,I wasn't through Chapter 3 and Wuthering Heights came to mind. I too am shocked that reviewers didn't mention it. I still enjoyed the book...
3,Wuthering Heights redux,"I don't get it. This story is so obviously derivative of Wuthering Heights, I'm kind of insulted. In fact I'm bewildered as to why more professional reviewers did not make note of that in their critiques of the novel - particularly since the similarities positively leap off the page. Fortunately, however, I did notice that at least one other reader-reviewer on amazon.com remarked on the rip-off factor. I don't know what to think, though - never having read Alice Hoffman before, I can't help but wonder if all her stories are reworkings of classics. If so she's wasting her talent, as I think her writing is strong. Now if only the ideas were hers..."
4,Breathless,"If you have ever been blind in love, breathless with longing and totally without volition, where your body and mind seem scoured by the beloved's presence, and only in his/her absence can you breath and move, then you will identify with the woman in this book. I felt as battered as she by the end, revolted and yet plummeting toward the finish, where surely, surely, something would be resolved, released, remembered. The author did not let me down."
2,A no brainer if your bored and there is nothing eles to read,"I was so excited to read this book. Into the 2nd chapter I could hardly believe what I was reading, Wuthering Heights? I had to check the cover of the book again. The only reason I finished it was sheer curiosity. I was most amazed at the character of Marchs husband, Richard. What man would let a woman he loves just leave without doing one damn thing? Especially when she is with a man like Hollis and Richard knew what kind of man he was. The characters were weak. I yearned for more depth in all of them. The ending was horrible. Your telling me that after all March went through with Hollis that she would not have been in the last few pages.( I do'nt want to give the ending away in case someone still wants to read it.) Right! It was easy to read and I did read it quickly. Hoping that it would get better. Did Oprah really read this book?"
5,Excellent,"Without a doubt one of the best books I've ever read. Could not and did not want to put it down. Now I want to read everything that Alice Hoffman wrote. I found myself with a pencil, marking off passages. A great read from beginning to end!!!!"
5,"Older woman from the Washington, DC area finds it ENGROSSING","I found the story to be very well done even though it wasn't a happy story as I hoped it would be. At times, I felt I was smack in the middle of Wuthering Heights. All of the main characters were to be pitited somewhat. Even though March and Hollis had a special connection, I was very glad that March finally reached the conclusion that she did since it was the only logical thing that could be done. I'm very interested in reading Practical Magic now."
1,Blatant Plagiarism,I can't believe the author didn't get sued for plagiarism as she stole almost the whole storyline from Wuthering Heights. The only difference is she modernized and cheapened what is a classic novel. I read the first chapter and was so shocked that she was able to publish and get away with writing a book that that takes so much from a classic novel. Surely there is someone else out there who sees the parallels of this novel with Wuthering Heights as I did. I generally like this author but was very disappointed with this book.
5,Here on Earth,I really enjoyed this book. It dealt with some very interesting issues. I look forward to reading more of her books!
3,"Very Good, yet somewhat familiar.....","I thought that this book was very appealing in both its content and subject matter. However, I just finished reading EMily Bronte's Wuthering Heights for my English class (I had read Here on Earth about three months earlier) and I realize now that Here on Earth is just a modern adaptation of Wuthering Heights. Hollis IS Heathcliff. For all readers of Here on Earth who are fans of historical fiction, I highly recommend Wuthering Heights."
3,"This book left me going, huh?","Alice Hoffman is a fine and talented writer but she does not do this novel justice. It was quite gutsy of her to reivent Emily Bronte classic, but she does it poorly. First of all, there is a lack of character development or rather depth. The only fully realized character in this novel is that of the daughter. Secondly, she fails to tie the loose ends in the novel i.e. Belinda. Why bring up issues if your not going to address it later in the novel? If you are looking for a dark romantic book please pick up Wuthering Heights."
2,Similar to WH but...,"This book has many of the themes in WH, the obsession, the secondary love story, the familial tie that is hinted at in WH, etc...But Heathcliff of WH while horrible in the second half of the book to most of the females he is involved with- Would never have hit Catherine- cheated on her ( I know, I know, what about Isabella?) this is different in this book. If fact Heathcliff declares how much he loves Catherine by saying, that he would relish killing Linton and Hindly but b/c Catherine loves them, he will not-The supposed obsessive love in this book is not love at all- it is more along the lines of a true sociopath that is prone to domestic violence. I think in his own twisted sense he felt like he loved March, but NOT LIKE HEATHCLIFF LOVED CATHERINE. So- these two are similar, but if you want quality- stick w/ WH."
1,Don't waste your time,"The abundant praise that this book has received should be ignored by anyone with good literary taste. Hoffman's writing style attempts to be poetic, but instead her prose is so crammed with flowery expressions that it is merely childish and annoying. Her observations about life lack true insight, and her characters are weak and one-dimensional. I am embarrassed that I ever purchased and attempted to read this horrible book--please use more common sense than I did and don't join the other readers who made ""Here on Earth"" a bestseller."
3,Sad,"This is the first Alice Hoffman novel that I read and I enjoyed her writing style. The book though depressing was never dull. It is a story of how destructive love can be. A what is suppose to be an intelligent women leaves her husband to get involved with her childhood sweetheart who ends up being a bitter, jealous and abusive man but she is still in love with the boy he once was and stays with him. This is all done in front of her teenage daughter who already has issues and who also becomes tormented mentally and physically. In addition, she falls in love with her first cousin and the mother is so self involved that she accepts the relationship. Just a sad and sick story."
3,Disappointing,"I used to think that if I disliked the characters of a novel, I could dismiss the novel as ""not very good"". No more. I despised Hollis, but the art it takes to create an evil person like him is immense. To continue to work with a horrible character that the author surely hated as well takes a lot of fortitude."
1,playing it safe,"I was excited when i realized this book was a modernized version of Wurthering Heights, but was soon dissappointed. Not that I expected it to live up to the original, but I at least thought it would be an interesting take on one of my favorite books. For one thing, the book did not go far enough - Hoffman tried to keep it ""safe"" for the modern reader. Hollis (Heathcliff) is completely one dimensional, negelecting the reader of the one character that makes Wuthering Heights such a great novel. Bronte never gave the reader what he/she expected - which is that either Heathcliff would turn out not to be so evil or that all the other characters in the novel would wise up and leave him to suffer alone. Hoffman gives the reader exactly what he/she is expecting, and this is what truly made the novel inferior to its predecessor."
2,Read Wuthering Heights,"If you've read Wuthering Heights, the plot will be extremely familiar. If you haven't read Wuthering Heights, read it instead of ""Here on Earth."""
2,No family can be this dysfunctional.,"What a great beginning! The story brought me into the small world of a Massachusetts town. The characters were believable and down to earth. Unfortunately, the book did not continue to be either believable or down to earth. I have never read about so many dysfuntional people or situations. There was alcoholism, incest, battering, sex with a 14 year old, low self-esteem, divorce, animal cruelty, small town politics, emotional abuse, and more machinations than anyone should put in one book. I could not relate to many of the main characters by the end of the story, although the daughter was the most interesting. Often the prose would get so flowery and/or detailed that I ended up daydreaming while trying to read. The greatest sadness was that I know this could have been so much better. That faith in the author kept me reading until the end. I do look forward to reading other books by Alice Hoffman, hoping that this one was an anomoly."
3,No Where Near Its Potential,"Oprah's penchant for dysfunctional families is readily apparent in Here on Earth. It starts off so well with really evocative prose but after a few chapters turns into a Movie of the Week plot. March's character never gets interesting and the daughter develops into someone totally unbelievable. The bad guy, Hollis, is laughable. Hollis seemed to be a Hud wannabee. After Paradise, Here on Earth is an ironic letdown"
2,good quality but to small,"I bought this bag for my new Toshiba notebook 15.4''. Its a very good qualitiy, but to small for this laptop. The original Toshiba bag is better - have more space, a lot of nice little bags and its great to use."
5,highly satisfied,i am very much satisfied by the laptop bag i received. i would certainly recommend it to others
4,very good,The notebook case is just what I needed to tote my laptop and a few of my very important files. I just wish I had more space to carry school books in it also to keep me from carrying an extra book bag.
2,Good size but poor quality,I use this case on a daily basis and have used it for about five months and by then both strap attachments and the handle broke and I am already having to look for a new case. If you are going to use this daily buy something that is of better quality. It looks nice and is not very bulky but will brake due to poor quality.
4,Samsonite L35 Laptop Case,Great buy. Lots of space and compartments without being bulky and it keeps your laptop secure.
4,nice bag,My laptop (thinkpag R60e) fits nicely and the bag has a good amount of cushioning. It could be slightly bigger though because there just insn't much room for accessories.
4,Good,"Accommodates notebook computers measuring up to 14.5 x 11 x 2.Computer notebook compartment surrounded by 10mm of foam padding for added protectionMade of lightweight and durable 600-denier polyester fabricSmartPocket' slides over the handles of today's popular rolling luggage.Comfortable padded handle and shoulder strap with interior and exterior easy access file pockets.full space for 5"" notebook pcs"
4,"Excellent, but definite drawbacks","I bought this case at the recomendation of a friend. The size of the case is great, it even fits under te seat on smaller airplanes. I do not need a lot of space for extras, so this is the perfect size. The padding is good and it is quite stylish. there is just enough size for a mouse, power cord, a fre CD's and a cell phone. I love the styling and details, it is well thought out.There is although one drawback. My machine is just shy of the maximum size allowed by th specs. There is a pouch inside for the computer, and it is a tight fit to put it in. This is a definite drawback, but given the opportunity I would buy the same one again."
1,Good for light laptops only......... hinges tear off easily,"When I first got this bag, it worked great. After about 3 months of regular use of bringing my laptop to school, I noticed the fake leather over the hinges for the shoulder strap started to tear, and eventually, they both broke off. I basically dropped my laptop the first time this happened and was not in a good mood. I hooked the straps on to the handle hinges which seemed to be a little sturdier, but they just tore off also. The construction of the hinges to the bag are not very good, as they rely upon the fake leather and a little (too small) of a a bolt that just goes into the bag (no washer on the inside to deter the bolt from pulling off the bag). The laptop I have is an older IBM T20 with an AC adapter and an extra battery. I'm guessing this is too heavy for the bag, even though the laptop is relatively light. I would never buy this model again."
3,Small Bag,"Purchased this bag for use with a Toshiba Satellite 15"" screen laptop. The laptop barely fits into the bag, and it is obvious the bag was designed for use with no larger than a 14"" screen laptop. The bag does however have a quality look and feel to it. I would recommend this bag for laptops with a screen smaller than 15""."
4,Slimming,"Ok, I was stupid b/c I have a 15.4"" widescreen laptop and I got this bag anyway. I guess I was stubborn. Well, it fits, but it's reallllllly tight. I would not recommend this bag for more than 15"" screen laptops. haha. Besides my own error, the bag is very slimming and easy to handle. It looks very chic and I've been getting a lot of compliments from my friends. I actually don't use it that much so everything is still in excellent shape. I would highly recommend it for people thinking about buying a laptop bag that isn't too bulky. For some reason, it attracts dust... I think it's the polyester fabric."
3,"Good Quality, But too tight for 15in laptop","I bought this for my 15in. Laptop. The laptop did fit in snugly, by with the power cord and USB optical mouse, it bulged in the frontan I had some difficulty closing the zipper. The quality of the material is excellent though. If you have laptop with 15in. or bigger screen, my suggestion is to look for a bigger one."
1,poor quality,The product was of poor quality.just after one use the shoulder pad ripped off.I had expected better quality from samsonite.
2,"Good Product, but not for 15""+","I bought this case for Dell Inspiron E1505 (15.4"") screen. It was way too small. This case has an inner pocket, which is the actual spot for the laptop to slip in. I will say it can only fit a 14"" screen. I ended up putting my laptop outside the inner pocket, which barely fit. I wish the manufacturer noticed this problem and not listed for any 15""+ screens."
2,Durability issues,"I used this case for business travel and noticed very early on that there were durability issues with the loops where the shoulder strap connects. As others have noted, the leather hiding the metal loops where the shoulder strap attaches quickly popped off. Despite this, I continued to use the bag for another year, and last week the metal loop on one side broke as well. The shoulder strap is now unusable with the case, so I'm looking for a replacement. The handle, which I rarely used, also had the leather tear away on one side, and the leather on the handle itself is cracked and worn.The rest of the bag has been fine, and useful for travel with a laptop. Unfortunately the poor durability has made this bag unusable for me in a professional setting. I really expected more from a Samsonite product."
3,Sturdy but heavy,"This bag is very sturdy. It can probably bang against anything and your laptop will not be damaged, however, it is very heavy and may work better for a man or a very strong woman."
2,Short life expectancy,"I travel extensively and had some success with Samsonite luggage, so I bought this notebook case expecting a reasonable use life. I have had the case for just over 5 months and the carrying handle has already nearly disintigrated requiring me to replace the case. I would not recommend this case for anyone who intends/needs to carry any more than seldom."
4,laptop case,"Great case for a laptop, and ONLY a laptop. Doesn't fit much else. Inside pockets are a little cheesy. But, for the price, it is a very functional bag with very stout padding for the computer."
4,Good little case!,"I bought this case for my husband because the one that I had gotten him with his Toshiba was heavier than my suitcases. This one is great and only slightly on the small side so if you want to bring your undies with you in it, it might be a bit small, but otherwise, what an improvement!"
5,Very Happy,"I bought this to go with my new laptop, and it works great, evrything fits good. There is lots of space and pockets for all my junk. It even looks great too."
5,"Very nice, good quality lap top bag","I really like this laptop bag. It's very sturdy, easy to haul around and definitely keep my laptop safe. My lap top is right at the top of the size maximum so it's a snug fit but it's not a problem. This is a good bag!"
4,Good simple design,Design and lightness are nice. Only grip is too soft and a little bit unconfortable to hold.
2,Not that Worthy,"The Quality of case is not that good.....and more over never buy from Amazon, they ship or deliver any item only after 8 to 15 days...........Please once again I suggest you not to buy from Amazon"
3,Samsonite L35 Notebook Case,"Excellent case for smaller notebooks. 15.4"" screen just barely fits. Good quality."
4,Great Quality,"This is a great case. Great quality, great functionality. I bought it for my sony vaio s460 notebook and it is really big for it. It fits my laptop, the charger, the mouse and some media in the main compartment. So the second pocket is free to carry anything extra. I really like this bag."
2,Not so big,"I have a Dell 1150 14"" screen and I had to return the case because it wasn't big enough. Also, the hole in the back pocket (for sliding on the luggage carrier) seems a little big--don't know if I would trust papers not to fall out of there."
2,Minimal Space,"My Dell Latitude D830 fits perfectly. BUT, there is VERY Little space for any accessories."
5,Excellent value and a quality notebook case,"I purchased this case for my daughter's Dell 14.1 inch notebook and it fits perfectly with just enough room to spare. It is sturdy, well made, good looking and far better quality than the vinyl bags I've seen in many stores selling for over $40 and $50. The side pocket to slide over the handle of any rolling luggage if you are traveling is another handy feature. There is also plenty of room and compartments for various accessories. Overall, I too would have paid more for this quality case."
4,Nice bag for the money,"I bought this for a Dell 1405 laptop 14"" screen, it fits perfect, could be problems for any larger size laptop. Quality is very good, well constructed. If it had more padding I would rate it a 5 star."
4,Good for the price,"An excellent product for the price. In local stores it costs $10 more. It has enough room for the essentials, but not much else because it is a thinner, lightweight case."
3,Great bag,"I really liked this bag. It has room for power cables and a few other small things. I had it for over a year but only used it occasionally. Unfortunately over the holidays the hand strap broke. Great buy, just be careful with the straps."
5,Great Laptop Case!,"This is a terrific laptop case. The interior pouch for the laptop is a tight fit for my HP widescreen 15.4"", but I'd rather have it that way than the laptop slopping around in transit -- less likely to be damaged. The exterior panel (behind the laptop), and the pouch lining are both well-padded.A huge bonus is that this case has *lots* of internal pockets (many with flaps so smaller objects don't come out!), places to put cellphone and pens and such... plus two zippered, cargo-net storage sections in the side section (read: visible, so you don't have to rummage thru each pouch look for commonly-stored items like cables, etc.), so this thing easily doubles as an organizer and briefcase.At this price, you can't ask for a better deal, or a better computer case."
5,Great Lightweight and Sleek Design Laptop Bag!,"I love this bag and I am so glad that I ordered it. I shopped around for a few weeks and nothing is as good as this. The quality of the bag is outstanding. The design is perfect to fit the laptop, batteries, pens, paperwork, etc. The padding inside really keeps the laptop secure. Other laptop bags that I saw were either bulky or super expensive. The price on Amazon is great however I would have definately paid more given what is out there currently. If you are considering this product look no further because this is what you have been looking for!"
3,Good but Smaller,"It looks good, but little bit smaller than I expected.I can not put in any more than computer."
1,Samsonite L35 notebook case,Very poor quality. I am very disapointed in this purchase. Not worth the money
5,nice elegant bag,"Got the laptop bag ON TIME!!! Thanks to Amazon!I really like this bag. Very elegant. Perfect Office laptop carry case. Nice finish and classy.If you are a college student.....IT IS NOT FOR YOU!I understand, in college , along with laptop, you would like to carry rest of the world!!! So i wont recommend you .As a professional....it is the BEST CHOICE!I m a Dentist and i do presentations all over....SO it looks Slick!Just neat looking!"
4,stylish and compact,"Having owned this carry case for 4 months now, I feel confident to offer this review. The samsonite notebook L35 is stylish and compact. You can pack the notebook, power adapter, a mouse (I like using a separate mouse instead of the mousepad), a couple of 3-subject notebooks for writing, pens, and other small accessories. But that's about it. There's not much wiggle room in this carry case. If you need a more space, don't get this. But if you're looking for a compact carry case that's stylish and clean looking, this is the ticket. My notebook is a Toshiba Tecra A5 and this carry case seems tailor built for it.(I subtracted a star because the zipper action in the main compartment is not as smooth as I would like it to be)."
2,It doesn't fit!,"Definitly a sharp looking notebook case, but DOES NOT HOLD a 15"" as it states in the description... plus, there is really no room to hold accessories (charger, mouse, etc)."
3,It had so much potential!,"I ordered this notebook case, and was really enjoying it for the first 4 weeks. It was the perfect size for my small PowerBook G4, plus there was some additional storage room for small books, etc. Unfortunately, the handle fell apart in week 5. Bummer! (I don't think I'm that hard on my luggage!) If it wasn't for the quick-to-fall-apart handle, I'd gladly give this product a 5 star rating."
5,BEST CASE,"This is one of the best Notebook cases. It has alot of pockets for all kind of stuff, has a saftey pocket for the laptop and may be used for different uses. Not suitable for big laptops."
5,Best match for MacBook Pro,"Looks very sturdy and an exact fit for my 15"" MacBook Pro. Shoulder strap looks pretty sturdy. It seems to take enough weight as long as we use it right.I cannot put my lunchbag in it like I used to with my earlier ""Compaq"" bag, but it has decent space to put my Mac power chord and some files and a note book."
5,More quality from Fluke,"These replaced my previous set of Fluke leads, which lasted a long time. The black shrouds at the ends that prevent it from bending to much seem like an improved design, so I'm looking forward to more good service."
4,Loudmouth Rocks!,"I discovered this band thanks to a review in Metal Edge magazine. The review said that Metallica was covering the song ""Not Free"" in concert and that they really liked this band. I brought it on that recommendation and I love this album!! It has twelve great songs and should be a must have for any hard rock fan. Just a piece of advise-listen to ""Maybe"" on head phones. It's a real trip! Boy was Metallica right. This is one of the best newer albums out now!"
4,I like it,"I received and built it yesterday, and all I can say is I'm happy with it. It holds a lot of DVDs without taking up a lot of space. Perfect for people who live in apartments. With it being clear and black, it'll look good regardless what you have in your living, bedroom or wherever you decide to place it. I only have two gripes. The instructions are a little hard to understand at first, but once you get going putting the DVD rack together is easy. Just be prepared to do a lot of kneeling and what not, so it might be good to take some painkillers either before or after you put the thing together. The lack of dividers, if you want to call them that, is the other thing I dislike about the rack. If you don't fill up a row, you might have some problems. Either than that, I do suggest getting it. Just be sure browse around before you buy it, or you'll be sorry."
3,The Little School,"The Little School was definitely a tale of survival. Partnoy in a way illustrates this novel more than writes it because she describes things with so much detail and really paints a picture in your head. Her stories are fascinating in both heart breaking and inspiring. The other survivors who went through this experience with her are described as very special people who she cared deeply about, even at times more than herself. The book is only about 130 pages with each chapter being extremely short so it only takes a couple hours to actually read the entire book and its an easy read at that. I enjoyed this book and think it should be considered as one of the better tales of survival amongst the many out there."
4,great book that shows survival,The way Alica was able to survive each day was amazing. She had hope that she was going to make the next day alive. To be blindfolded for a period of time is just crucial. I have no idea how she was able to stick it through.I am very glad that she did. Reading this novel makes me not take things for granted. An example of this is being able to brush my teeth when I choose or just to have running water. These are things that help us live but imagine my life with out these things would be another story. I am truly grateful for the things that I have and it makes me think how fortunate I am.
5,Great Book,"This book caught my attention from the moment I read the title. Kept me wanting to read more of it. I read almost the whole book in one day. Portnoy describes in detail all the things she saw, smelled, felt and experienced in the Little School. She demonstrates that she is a tough woman and a survivor to be able to surpass all the torture and hunger she experienced. She not only took care of herself to be able to survive but she was also willing to risk her life to help the other people that were captured. She makes us feel like we are living and experiencing the things she experience. She Even provides a sketch of the Little School so we can have a picture of the place she was kept. If it wasn't for Portnoy I would have never known of the killings in Argentina."
4,"nice eye-candy, wish it had more depth","This is a 64 page book with photos. There step-by-step instructions (with photos for each step) for some of the ideas depicted. The photos of the results are very pretty, but not something like a beginner like me could achieve. There are a couple of photos of sample planted aquariums - I have a planted aquarium, but it's not something you would see out of a magazine or even an aquascaping contest (the photos in the book are)!The instructions are very general. For example for one item you are told to paint with a ""suitable preservative"". Nor does the book go into much detail about the plants used, except their names, and that they will have to be trimmed or repotted often. I guess this is a good idea book if you you know more on your own about plants, the types of tools and materials you will be using."
5,Great power and economy,"I bought this one for my ford Lobo (F-150 xlt) 2003, installation was very easy in about an hour, once you start it you can hear the difference but wait untill you push that pedal to bottom, you her your engine snoring like never before and the acceleration as well, great product. I also saw about a 18% more mileage after the installation."
4,K&N 57-2541 Fuel Injection Kit - 2002 Ford F150 v8 5.4L,Instructions were easy to follow and install went well. Truck seems to run smoother although I haven't had a chance to pull my boat over high mountain terrain. I usually use this truck to pull my boat over steep terrain to get to the lakes so I haven't had a chance to see if there is a power increase. Haven't checked gas mileage either.
2,Not as good as I hoped,"I purchased this for my 2010 Nissan Frontier Pro-4xI have no power or response from about 35 to 45 mph, bogs bad just tryin to keep even speedGas millage did increase as long as you go 60 mph otherwise no improvement therePower is much higher just not at above mentioned speedsSounds great but just not worth the hastle at low speed, will be going back to stock very soon"
4,Azul Palido,"I bought this CD shortly after it was released in 1989. I am still listening to it. Nuff said. That and the fact that ""Covered in Roses"" is not the best track--rather it is ""Pale Blue"". By 1992, this CD was almost impossible to find and I thought I had a very rare and very fine disc on my hands. I am glad to see it back in print."
4,"Great early ""Toad"".","Even though I believe ""Pale"" is their best album, this debut is similar to it. ""Toad The Wet Sprocket's"" popularity came more with their later alt-pop sound, but this here is more alt-country really. ""Way Away"" was an early hit, and I also like ""Unquiet"", ""Know Me"", and ""One Little Girl"". However the closer ""Covered In Roses"" is the most moving song to me. I once made a tape which was just that song repeated. Anyway, anyone who likes the band, or similar ones should enjoy ""Bread And Circus""."
5,One word...Smashing!!!,I regret not buying this album before ALL the other Toad albums. Infact Bread and Circus was the last in my Toad collection. Their music has been daily bread in my circus-life for years...
3,A hint of their future achievements.,"This is a must have for Toad fans simply because this is their first effort and was created before they were signed by Columbia. The production is not first rate but when you consider that they made this album with their own bucks when they were still in their teens, it kind of makes you appreciate it in a different light."
3,Spotty,"Toad's first album is a mixed bag. There are some pretty weak songs here, with a bit too much California ""laid-backness"" for my taste. But ""Covered In Roses"" is a great song."
5,Sweet Camera,"I generally am a fan of the casio cameras...for quality, practicality, and the usb cradles (as opposed to the ones where you have to physically take out the battery and charge it separately...pretty lame).And this one is no exception. The only thing I wish was that instead of the 2.8"" lcd screen, they'd gone with the full 3"" one (like Canon SD750). The reason it makes a difference is because when you take standard size pictures you end up with two blacked out bars on the sides...which essentially is equivalant to a 2.5"" screen. True, you can resize to 3x2 or 16x9 format and also the cropping only happens when you're in a shooting and not the viewing mode...but none of this would be a problem if they'd just made the screen 3"".But hey...I've given up on finding a perfect camera...none of them have all the right features in any single package. But this one is as close as it gets."
4,Casio EX-Z1200,The camera was exactly what my son needed. The item was sent and received in a timely manner. Thank you
2,A definite no!,"Awful shoes. They seem like they would be cute in theory but not only are they completely uncomfortable, but they make legs look like tree stumps.(And I have really skinny legs!) they need more shape at the ankle."
3,Little red riding Hood,"This book is about a little girl called little red riding hood because she always wear a red jacket.One day she decided to take muffings and lemonade.While she was on her way the wolf stop her to ask her questions like what she has in the bag and where she is gonig.The wolf told her to take her grandmother some flowers and th wolf went to her grandmother's house, the wolf tried to trick her grandmother but she got him and the wolf got scare of her.The wolf became friends with her and work with her on the store and he was able to eat all the muffings he wants."
4,exiting,"it was a thrilling and exiting book.i liked it when liz tells the others that they should not leave without the others,even though they had a fight.everyone should read this book!but be sure to read book 1 of this seaies before."
5,They Just Don't Make 'Em Like That Anymore....,"In a time when the""F"" word is the signature for comedy ..This was a creative genius CLEAN as well as funny ...Humor for all ages ..They just don't make 'em like this anymore"
5,A (too-short) walk down memory lane: We Want More Allan!!,"When I was a girl, we had 2 Allan Sherman LPs: My Son the Folk Singer and My Son the Celebrity. We listened to them so much that I'm sure the grooves were significantly deeper! We aren't Jewish, nor did we ever live in New York. But, his stuff is so funny on so many levels.I just received the CD ""My Son The Greatest"", and while it has many of his great songs on it, it's still missing my favorites: ""The Ballad of Sir Greenbaum"", ""When I Was a Lad"", and ""Let's All Call Up AT&T;"", to name a few...."
4,lovethosenovelties,"I have been a fan of Allan since my early radio days(years ago). I even purchased the 45 single of a parody of ""Hello Muddah...."". It was done by Sandra Gould, and entitled ""Hello Melvin(This Is Mama)on the Philips label.It, too is hilarious...While I hold this Best Of cd in high reguards, and it does contain the bulk of his vintage works, it does omit one of his funniest singles(which also made Billboards Hot 100), called ""Drinking Man's Diet"". I would have thought that someone would have seen fit to include it.Even though Drinking Man's...wasn't a huge charted hit, it still belongs on a Best Of cd.Overall, it is still a worthwile buy, and captures that unmistakable Allan Sherman spirit."
4,memories with alan sherman,most of this cd was funny. like any theres a few songs that were kinda eh (shrug) to me. but yet still good. he's made me laugh now and did when i heard camp granada as a kid. :)
4,The Great Allan Sherman,"In the good old days of LP, I had all his records. This collection of his ""BEST"" is good, but does not include some of his greatest hits. At least by my taste. But then, any Allan Sherman is worth listening to."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Another riff on the whole music teacher thing. Unfortunately this one is pretty dull. It looks at a very commercialised world of music where being a classically trained music teacher is not all that financially rewarding. e.g. not necessarily a lot different to know.He has made up another genre of music to be the 'rap' of the time.Underlying all this is some dodgy goings on. Needed to be a bit more of that to be interesting.If you are a music teacher type, you might enjoy it more."
2,"Interesting ideas, mediocre writing","Ultimately, there's nothing original or effective enough in ""Archform: Beauty"" to set it apart from the SF herd. Modesitt creates a fairly convincing world and sets up an interesting web of relationships among his narrators, but the whole effort is undermined by poor writing. Descriptions are flat. Dialogue is artificial and stilted. Future-slang is unnatural -- in some cases, practically unpronounceable. Language naturally evolves in directions that are easier to speak aloud, not harder. ""Counterfeit"" would never evolve into ""feit"" (sounds too much like ""fit,"" and many more colorful synonyms already exist), nor ""Denver"" into ""Denv,"" nor the already well-established ""condo"" into ""conapt."" Maybe I've been spoiled by Neal Stephenson, but I like my science fiction to be good writing, not just good speculation."
4,The First of Two Books,"This is the first of two books written about this couple. The second book is called Crossing Divides: A Couples Story of Cancer, Hope, and Hiking Montana's Continental Divide. You might enjoy reading about what happened to them after their marriage and their encounter with cancer and hiking the Continental Divide."
2,Disappointing and irritating.,"Cover describes book as a ""light hearted adventure story"", should have been ""a travel ordeal"". Showed how lack of training and improper equipment can turn what should have been fun into drudgery. Choose biking as a cheap mode of transport rather than doing it for the pleasure of cycling which effected narrative. Constant whining and complaining made it hard to enjoy. Use of local NZ slang got old and author trying to force his personal views on locals seemed inappropriate. I have biked in NZ and it was nothing like the book described."
5,Sharpshooter,"David Healey has done an excellent job at his first attempt. This Civil War Novel puts you back to a time when the nation was in geat turmoil. He has created very belivable fictional characters. Lucas Cole is a person who you love to hate. David's grasp of that time period is extemely well put forth and it sends you back to that time. He also makes the story very plausable and is a good history lesson with fictional plot and characters. This book is hard to put down once started. Mr. Healey, a job well done!"
4,A great read!,"This book was a fun read. Fast paced, very factual, yet because it was an original hypothetical premise it kept you reading on with suspense. It's historicaly acuarate descriptions and scenes make it a fun Civil War novel, unlike many Civil War novels that seem slow and read like a history book. Fans of historic fictions love to be educated and entertained at the same time, and this book delivers. Good simple Characterization and compelling plot made it a pleasure to plow through this authors first novel."
1,"Carefully note the ""and other cartoons"" on the label","If you're buying this for Dodo, don't. I was very disappointed to discover there is only ONE episode of Dodo on this disc."
2,Not so great.,"I ordered these to have floating in a pool for a small wedding reception, In the picture it is described as having multiple colors.I received only white and lavender.Although they did function well, I wouldve liked to have the different colors."
4,Fast Track for Understanding Statistical Research,"This is not the book if you are seeking the methodological details, but if you want to understand academic research with results defined by statistical causal analysis quickly and in plain English, this is an excellent starting point."
5,great seller,The book came in promptly and in the condition stated. I had a question about the shipping and the seller responded to my question quickly too! I would buy from this seller again
3,Just okay...,Our family enjoys the first two CDs in this series more. I like the voices/style of the first two CDs better.
5,Excellent,A very well made cd. it isn't annoying like a lot of cds for kids. I enjoy it as much as my daughter does!
3,Country Worship: Seek Ye First,"for those who loves country music, this collection will be an asset, this includes one of my favourite song ""Create in me a Clean""."
2,Seems half-finished,"First off, the maps are awful. One would hope that for each region all the entries would be shown on a region map so you can see how far away from each other they are -- but no, there's no such visual guide. You have to read each entry and determine (ah, this one is VERY far south from where I am now).Also, the book is rather thin compared to the FF guide to Washington or the FF guide to Colorado. I own all three and the Oregon one is definitely the least of them."
1,Flyfisher's Guide to Oregon,"The book fails to provide adequate detail on the rivers to make it a valuable resource. Most of the descriptions are generic and sound the same. If you want a book to help you find good fishing spots, look elsewhere."
3,Not as good as old model,"I have had a Stromgren knee brace for several years and really liked it. When my other knee started giving me problems, I decided to purchase another Stromgren brace. I couldn't find one in the local drugstores, so I turned to Amazon. I thought I was getting the same brace as I already had, as the picture looked the same. However, this one is made of much thicker rubber and is very difficult to get on. It is so tight I get concerned about wearing it more than an hour or so. I bought an XL and it shouldn't be this tight, but it is. I would not have bought this model if I could have seen it in a store before purchase."
2,Disappointed !,I have an HP Pavillion ZE5000 series laptop. My laptop hardly fits in this bag. The battery holder is also too small. Practically unusable. Very disappointed with the product.
3,Scratches the notebook !,"The case has a main compartment with a sleeve to insert the notebook. However, there is no space enough to put the notebook in the sleeve without scratching its bottom with the zipper around the case. The pockets for accessories aren't well planned. My suggestion: look for another case."
2,"Well design, except for the notebook itself.","The bag is very nice looking, nice material, everybody loves it. Lots of compartments inside fit all accessories I need plus some documents. But the top part (the zipper) is a BIG problem, it just has to get 200% in a way, while the notebook pocket doesn't provide any flexibility. I just have to scratch my brand new notebook in and out, very frustrating. (same as another review here). My opinion, find another one, I'm gonna do it myself."
1,Top 60 tips: saltwater fishing,"I am interested in buying some videos of saltwater bottom fishing for an instructional class. But you have no information about the content of your videos, so how could I make an intelligent choice on what to buy? Provide info on the content and they might sell."
4,XSLT WITH A MAGNIFICENT TOUCH,"The outlook of this ""XSLT Cookbook"" is refined: giving luxurious accommodation to experts, without scaring beginners away. Most of its 450 pages were dedicated to a sensible problem-solution-discussion pattern, (which readers should appreciate).Apart from analyzing how to manipulate XML documents with Stylesheets, elaborate methods of using SVG and XSLT to plot graphs and charts were stressed. The otherwise tricky art of creating SOAP documentations from WSDL (using XSLT) was reduced to nursery rhymes.I am satisfied by this author's method of tackling XSLT problems. Still, when the next edition of this book appears, I would expect to see a better job done: as regards all those precursors, which facilitate the processing of Visio documents in XSLT.In conclusion, I would say that this is one of the few eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations books, which did not discriminate between beginners and advanced learners. All are welcomed! A great value indeed!"
4,learn from examples,"I needed something quick that had lots of examples of transorming text in one format to other text in another format. Had to tabulate on a text file with rows and columns of fixed length some data elements found in a XML file. This book showed me how. The $35 alone saved me several hours of my time. Sure, you could search the web, and maybe you would could find exactly what you need. But why hurt your eyes, when the price is low enough to have this simple and efficient tool called ""book"", at your desk, anytime you need to transform a xml file again."
5,Great book for all levels,"Probably one of the best XSLT books--at least, that I have seen. Well-suited for all user levels...top-end topics include SOAP, WSDL, and SVG. An indispensable resource for the XML developer."
3,"Pretty well rounded, missing some specifics","Excellent book to get the basics in many different areas of using XSLT. My focus is converting XML to HTML so naturally I was mostly intent on reading those chapters; the rest of them had academic value to me.The problem I find with this book is that it doesn't focus on XSL tools and how to write snippets of code for them (I am using XSLmaker and didn't find anything on it). Maybe the book was not totally up to date. In any case, modern XSL development is driven by visual tools like XSLmaker that let you code Xpath filters or define XSL code for visual HTML fields - and that sort of integration was what I expected.Still, I gleamed few useful tricks that saved me some time, so the book was worth it after all."
5,Better Than The Internet,"While much of the examples can be gleamed from the internet, they are organized and indexed very usefully here.I do very little XSLT, and this book has saved me countless hours of research and development.Note that this book is not for beginners. And that makes it even better."
4,Some useful examples,"The code examples in the book can be found online. While several of them are quite helpful, this book is by no means an exhaustive reference, nor does it clearly articulate the basics. See the w3schools website for this."
3,Poorly organized source code,"One would think that such a code-heavy book would need decently organized source code to make it easy to follow along. Unfortunately I found this not to be the case.Trying to relate examples in the book with the downloaded source has been truly an unpleasant experience.For example, Chapter 2 shows an xml called numbers.xml which serves as input to most of the examples in the Chapter. Although there's a numbers.xml file it the directory source, it only contains about 10 lines, while the book example contains about 27 lines. But if you look in the Chapter 14 sample code directory, there is a numbers.xml file which corresponds to the sample in Chapter 2."
5,Useful XSLT Recipes,"This book was very helpful in getting my first XSLT transform up and running in just a few days. Its Problem -- Solution -- Discussion format provides ready-made solutions for a range of transformation problems, from the simple to the more complex. In my case, I quickly found clear and straightforward illustrations of how to produce multiple text output files from an XML input file.This book is not an XSLT language reference. But it is a good supplement to, for instance, Michael Kay's XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0 programmer's references."
5,Great Collection of Summer Originals,"The original hits by the original stars, this 18 track CD provides a solid collection of summer songs from Eddie Cochran's 50's hit ""Summertime Blues"" to the Beach Boys, War, Sly, and Lesley Gore.A good package of summer tunes perhaps only superseded by ""25 All-Time Greatest Summer Songs"" on the Varese Sarabande label with its originalhits and artists."
1,"get something better, this is not worthy","I had to waste 2 of more than 50' cable as they failed to work properly. no error was detected by cable tester. However, on connection to PC this cable was unable to connecte to net. Small length cables upto 10' working fine. As three peices of cables between 30-50' is failed to work, I used a readymade 50' cable from radio shack to hook the computer and it worked well. Further all cables I made from this bundle whcich is less than 10' works flowless.... strange but true... poor quality cable."
5,Standard CAT5e,"This is 500' of standard CAT5e cable (four twisted pairs in a blue jacket). Good for internal internet and telephone wiring. The standard color connection configurations are available online.I don't trust my internet connections to a wireless router, and I needed to replace some phone wiring under the house (fun). 500' was more than I needed, but it cost less than the local stores wanted (the distant few that carry CAT5 at all) and I got free shipping through Amazon Prime - easy choice."
5,Great Quality,"Great standard role of CAT5E Cable. For the price, it is perfect for home and small networking projects."
4,3 inch speakers,These speakers are small and provide a muchbetter sound than the speakers in my TV.This was my reason for the purchase.These 3 inch speakers provide good soundwhen connected to an amplifier (receiver).They can handle a high volume setting.
5,I'm very pleased with them.,"These make a great top end for any system with a subwoofer. Of COURSE they don't produce floor shaking bass by themselves... They're 3 inches in diameter!... But they are very clear on the top end and they're very small and very light so they mount easily on a satellite mount, although they needed to be drilled. But that was easy. And they look nice... Clean, unobtrusive... And the price is very good. Overall quality of construction seems very good to me. For low volume applications in small rooms they work well enough by themselves. But tie these babies in with a subwoofer and you've got a killer system. I'm buying two more. These speakers remind me very much of the Bose cubes... And probably sound very nearly as good."
5,Good compact speakers,"I purchased this as well as thePyle Home PCA1 30-Watt Stereo Mini Power Amplifierfor my computer, and they work quite well."
1,Broke within 1 month,I was initially satisfied with these speakers. They are small and sound fine for the size and price. However one of the speakers fell apart in my hand when I lifted it to dust. I believe this is the same problem others have had - the plastic where screws hold the speaker/grill to the enclosure box break.
4,Good value,It meets the value of quality as a pair of presence speakers even thought it has 3 inch cube that kind of size fits almost everywhere in my living.
3,Forget the BOOM!,"Nice looking speakers that will pretty much fit anywhere, but if it is a strong bass your'e after, go look elsewhere.At best, the overall sound is fair to good. At least the neighbors won't complain!"
4,Great speaker,"I have 3 pair of this speaker all through my house. As I get older I'm loosing hearing at the top end of the sound scale and these help to bring the music alive. Not too bright as might be expected with a tweeter, just enough."
2,Pyle mini cube bookshelf speakers,"I thought these might be nice as I live in a small apartment and can't really have a huge home theatre system. The size is nice as they fit on top of my T.V. stand and don't block the screen. I hooked them up and turned on the radio to try them out. I was really disappointed because there was noticeable distortion coming from one speaker. I switched the speakers from right to left and so on as I thought it might be a problem with my receiver or something. But the same distortion was apparent in the one speaker. The sound quality from the good speaker wasn't bad. It would have been sufficient for my needs as it would be better than the T.V. speaker. So as a result of this I am returning these and have to look for something of better quality. The price was right, though."
1,physical description is deceiving,These speakers are much smaller than the pictures. The connections are not compatible with most CD players. You will need an amplifier or receiver to make these speakers work.
3,Could not hook up,Speakers looked like they would work however there was no way I could hook them up to TV.Had to send them back
3,Not Sure,"These arrived and looked great.. however I had no idea they didn't have wires.. I had no patience for trying to find them.. so I bought another type and will prob just keep these for another time.. or need.... Really Really wish it would have stated... ""WIRES NEEDED""."
1,"This may be a great product, but I guess I'll never know...","I purchased these speakers because of the price ($20 instead or supposed $70 value), however it wasn't mentioned in the description at the time that these speakers DO NOT come with ANY of the needed cords and wires! After multiple attempts to BUY numerous cords for this product, I was unsuccessful. It has became a great waste of time and money. (Each additional cord cost me at least 10 bucks, and not one of them worked.) Later I saw the ""often bought together"" box and apparently to make these work, you have to spend an additional $40 bucks on the wires and amplifier! I mean, should it really be THIS much hassle (not to mention the price!! (almost $70) to set up 3 INCH SPEAKERS?! Calling this purchase a disappointment is not saying anything at all! Horrible waste of time and money!"
3,1st set damaged. 2nd set damaged...,"I sent the first set back because one of the speakers was detached from the speaker box (broken). The second set arrived same kind of damage. This time I took out the 5 minute epoxy instead of going through the return business again. For little 3 inch full range speakers, they are pretty impressive. Efficient and loud. Don't expect a punchy bass from these little guys. Get your epoxy ready."
1,CHEAP,The sound is fine but the quality of the box is very cheap! One of the speakers can be pushed into the box it is attached to. I did not discover this until after the one week return policy was over. My fault I guess.
4,Nice little pair of speakers,Nice cheap speakers for a small stereo - Comes without wires. Easy to connect to a stereo that has the same kind of connections (red and black wires - strip off the insulation about half an inch to expose the wire - slip bare wire ends into the clip things - matching the color - on the back of the speakers and on the back of the stereo. I took the wires off an old pair of speakers that hooked up the smae way) The sound is ok for a small room. More power than I expected. First pair I got had to be returned because on speaker didn't work - The second pair I received works fine. Good pair of cheap speaker.
3,Not impressed with sound quality,"For the price I guess these are OK speakers. Certainly better than stock TV speakers. However, when I pushed audio through a Yamaha receiver, the sound quality was lacking even at low volume. Not sure what the recommended use for these speakers would be."
4,Pyle Home PCB3BK 3Inch 100Watt Mini Cube Bookshelf Speakers,"The speakers fit what I was looking for well. I needed a set of small speakers for a small living room for my compact stereo and to use with my TV. They sound much better than the TV speakers and are OK for music. Of course they lack the base range, but mid range is clear and tight. Voice on the TV is much clearer with less distortion. These would make great side and rear speakers coupled with a subwoofer in an entertainment system. I don't want to get into all that, so they work well for my purposes."
5,Nice little speakers,"I bought these for the basement, attached them to an amp, and play music from an ipod through them. In the small space they do very well. Good sound and volume. Great speakers for the price."
2,Warning - likely to arrive broken,"The speakers sounded OK before I returned them. One good set arrived, but was the wrong color. I returned it. The second and third sets arrived with one of the two speakers broken. The case is too fragile for the enclosed speaker. I sent all the speakers back for a refund."
2,No customer support,"I ordered these speakers to hook up to my TV. The connections are incompatable with any I have had experience with. I contacted Pyle Support for help on three occasions,about a week apart,and have yet to hear from them. I am stuck with speakers I can't use and still can't hear my TV without headphones."
1,do not buy this item,"received the speakers,connected them to amplifier, could not hear the music etc. over the loudraspy noise coming from the speakers,connected another pair of different brand they are OK.these are 100% junk,DONT BUY"
3,scuffed,"Just got these. Opened them up and there's scuff marks all over. One of them the box and the grill had scuffs and the other one just the grill. I paid for new speakers, these look like a returned product they got back and shipped them right back out without inspecting them. I'm not returning them, I'll just repaint them. NICE! They sound OK. Like everyone else says no bass, but the vocals sound pretty good and that's what I bought them for."
5,Great for what we got them for,"We just got a 42"" plasma tv, and as we all know, the speakers on these TVs aren't very good. I have a high end stereo (not home theater) and can play the TV sound through the stereo speakers, but my big speakers are made more for music, not dialog. I got these Pyle speakers to use as an ""inbetween"" solution. I hooked them up as the ""B"" speakers on the stereo and they do a very admirable job. MUCH better than the TV speakers. When we want to just relax with a show, we turn on just the B speakers, when we're watching something that needs big sound, we turn on the big speakers as well for nice full sound. Eventually we'll get an AV tuner as well, and use these little speakers for center speakers. Not a lot of bass response, so don't expect that, but miles better than the built in TV speakers."
4,Very good buy,These speakers were well worth the money. I installed them on my 5.1 surround system and they work perfectly.
4,quality speakers in a small package,"I used these to replace the broken speakers on my PC subwoofer system. They sounded a little different, but they were still nice. the original speakers had a little more high range I think. but they had a tweeter, these do not. These speakers are weighty for their size and have some heft to them as well which really does affect the sound quality."
4,good deal,"Great little speaker! I would buy them again. a lot louder than I thought they would be, and easy to hide"
5,Glass Fat Seperator,"A Quality product constructed from laboratory glass. As with any glass item, with care it should last a lifetime. Dishwasher safe which is a definite plus."
3,Good Overview Of Mobile Campaign,"Mobile 1865 is probably the best book on the Mobile campaign but leaves something to be desired. A glaring omission is the maps. No Civil War history should be without helpful maps to visualize the text, but there is only three period drawings of the defences-not very helpful. The author also goes into a little too much detail on each unit's prior history and their commanders. This causes the book to not really become interesting until the real action starts after about 100 pages. It was also a little irritating that the author uses the common, politically correct view of black troops. In the chapter he devotes to black units his account of their actions are misleading and too generous. Still, there is little literature on the Mobile campaign and this book details the actions and the campaign as a whole fairly well. It's probbly the best book on the subject but the definitive history of the campaign is yet to be written."
2,Men Are Just Desserts,"The book was in fair condition, but rated higher by the seller. However, the book is several years old which is the probable cause for the condition."
2,I personally think that the book was a waste of time.,"In the book The Eyes of the tarot, a woman by the name of Bonnie, finds an ancient pack of cards hidden in the pannel of the wall. To her suprise, she finds out that she knows what the symbols on the cards represent. Throughout the course of the book, she is called upon to tell other individuals their future, and becomes completely oblivious to the fact that the cards are telling her that something terrible is going to happen to her family. After she finds out that her family is in danger, she warns them, and protects them from their enevitable fate. However, later she also finds out that she is the next one on the cards, and she knows that there is nothing she can do to save her self from the death that she is about to endure. The reason why I think that the book was a waste of time si because I don't like books like this. However an individual who does enjow books of this nature would most likely enjoy it to the fullest extreme."
3,Not bad but....,"Some very poor selections on here. It also almost ignores his two best CDs-The Rose of England and Cowboy Outfit. (And what is ""Maureen"" doing on here? uggg--where are Wishing Well, I Got the Love, Luck Dog, LAFS, etc.) 14 of these songs are from his first two albums--too much in my opinion.But the real gripe is that the bulk of this man's CDs are unavailable. No one should have to settle for this collection when you think of what he did from about 1978 to 1990. Some truly great stuff is lost. I think he is the most underrated musician in all of rock. Bar none."
2,Hate when CD versions delete selections from the original LP!,"Business as usual: There are selections missing from the original double LP edition. In my LP version of this compilation, is included ""Long Walk Home"", one of the best instrumentals I've ever heard with a neat 50s sound.. In this CD, is gone! WHY???"
2,Failed experiment,"I bought this on vinyl when it first came out in the '80s, but haven't listened to it since then. I'm listening to it now, and I have to say, regretfully, that it's pretty bad. The artists are to be commended for going way out on a limb with this experiment in alternative rock, but the result, for the most part, is a mishmash of amateurish, inept composition and instrumentation with annoying vocals. I don't think I'll be listening to it again very soon."
3,It's not really that amazing,"I purchased this album mainly due to the glowing reports from others on this web site. However, when I listened to the album, I was a little surprised. I found myself skipping track after track, and mainly listening to just three tracks. I found that the only good tracks on this album are ""Only Time"" by Enya, ""Heart Door"" by Paula Cole and Dolly Parton (which is an amazing duet) and the classic ""The Other Half of Me"" by Bobby Darin.If you think 3 tracks classifies a purchase of this album, go for it, but otherwise buy it used or get as a gift. That way you'll save yourself a little money to get a really great album soundtrack like ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou?"""
3,Add Me To The List !,"I bought this CD for the new Stevie Nicks song. And I must say it's one of her best in years. It's OK as soundtracks go. The rest of the tunes aren't bad. But if I'm being honest, Mrs. Nick is all I really listen to intently"
4,Go Ahead...,"If not for anthing else, buy this to listen to Stevie Nicks. Her voice is like no other!!!!"
4,Awwww... sweet!,"I bought this for some new romantic material and for the Enya song, but Consequenses of Falling soon displaced it as my favorite, and the Stevie Nicks song became a favorite too! A great, almost moody but still so sweet collection, I really enjoyed it!"
2,Another sucker for a Stevie song!!,"I am such a die-hard Stevie fan that I bought this CD knowing I would probably not like anything else on the disc. There are a couple of other songs that aren't bad (Amanda Ghost, Paula Cole and Dolly Parton), but overall it is not very memorable. If you are like me and are planning to buy this just for the Stevie song (which is worth the price alone), you would do better to save the money and just download Stevie's song off of Napster (while you still can!!)Rock on, Gold Dust Woman!!!"
1,can`t review because i have not received it yet,"still waiting for this item ordered 9/13 and now it is 10/15 and no cd!em, was to be a gift and me and the birthday girl are sad and i`m mad! am disappointed,to say the least."
4,A beautifully illustrated book with a simple story line,"The illustrations carry this book along in its simple story of a little armadillo asking his desert friends about the moon. The pictures are bright, vivid, and appealing. The story line is simple, with the different desert animals offering their ideas of what is the moon, much as different cultures have different myths of the moon as well. The scientific explanation at the end is not too long for this age group. I would have liked for the text to have more about the desert life of Armadillo Ray, or his feelings, as the one shortcoming is that the text is not quite as involving as the illustrations."
1,Peacock Day Bed,"I would never order from this company again!! Who sells a day bed with out the link spring to put the mattress on????????? I was VERY upset to find this out and then later looked at my order and in very FAINT lettering on the picture of the bed it says ""FRAME ONLY"" NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER HERE!!!"
3,Toto has a better greatest hits album,"I don't know if you are aware, but there is a better compilation of Toto (Toto's greatest hits) that is much more complete as this one, since it's on a double CD. You will lose the songs from Jean Michel Byron (bonus tracks from past to present), but is that so important ? (I don't like him, he imitates Michael Jackson); and what you win is ""Stranger in town, If you belong to me, Holyanna, Don't chain my heart, gypsy train, straight for the heart..."" , isn't it much better ?"
5,This is awesome stuff... I don't care what anyone says...,"As the title says, I don't care what anyone says, this is awesome stuff... It's pop music, definately, but it's good pop music... and there is nothing wrong with a good pop song, or well, an album full of good pop songs... I find this album to be perfect when you're in a sappy mood, because it's full of sappy love songs, or when you're head over heels in love... I know it has helped me get through tough times, and has also enhanced the good feelings in a relationship... it's good stuff and sometimes you just don't want to have to think or analyze music too much... sometimes you just want to sit back and enjoy... my favorite songs are Africa, Rosanna, I'll Be Over You, Georgy Porgy, etc... but there really aren't any bad tracks on here..."
3,A sufficient hits package.,"This hits package isn't a bad starting place for someone that's new to Toto. There's a total of thirteen tracks--four of them are previously unreleased. Surprisingly, there are no songs included from the albums Turn Back and Isolation. In order to have been comprehensive, at least one song from each of those albums should have been included. Some of the tunes that I like are ""Africa,"" ""I'll Be over You,"" and ""I Won't Hold You Back."" The four unreleased tracks are not bad. I do admit that Jean-Michel Byron's vocals aren't my taste. I consider this hits package to be pretty good. It contains some nice songs. It's worth a listen."
2,Africa And Twelve Other Tracks.,"Africa really is a fantastic song from start to finnish and I had hoped many of the remainder would be of a high standard.The only others I knew are Hold The Line and Rosanna, these are good as far as they go, however most of the rest are not distinctive enough to take my full interest.Having said that Out Of Love and I Won't Hold You Back are ballards in the 1980s Chicago mould, so no complaints there.Overall not the best 1980s rock to be found, I prefer Boston, Joe English Band, Dire Straits, Kansas and Asia."
3,Just Too Wimpy,"This collection definitely caters to the pop and Toto IV fans. Toto could really rock and Steve Lukather is one of the best guitar players around. I would like to have seen a better variety of songs and inclusion of some old FM rockers. You can do a better job piecing together your own ""Best of"" collection from their first 3 albums and their 5th album. Some great Toto songs are missing including: I'll Supply the Love, Rockmaker, Hydra, St. George and the Dragon, Gift with a Golden Gun, Think I Could Stand You Forever, English Eyes, Stranger in Town."
3,Great songs scattered through a mediocre album,"I feel sad to be giving a Toto greatest-hits collection a mere three stars when it features classics like ""Africa,"" ""I Won't Hold You Back"" and ""Georgy Porgy,"" but the album itself just doesn't flow as a piece. The newly recorded songs give me an itchy skip-button finger, and one of my favorites, ""Stranger In Town,"" has been omitted. Come on, guys, you are capable of doing much, much better than this."
3,Lot of songs are missing,This could be a good compilation in 1990 but now toto has released other albums and this CD is no more enough. Anyway there were lots of songs missing.
4,Very good album!,"I just got this cd the other day and I am very pleased with it. The new songs were good, but the oldies were even better. Hold the Line, Rosanna, Africa, I Won't Hold You Back, and especially Georgie Porgy are all great. This is a worthy investment if you're an 80's freak like me."
3,"Not exactly a greatest hits, but....","I really hate to give a Toto album only three stars, but can someone please tell me why a ""hits"" or ""best of"" type album would EVER have a NEW song on it? I've never understood this and I feel it insults my intelligence. Also, the inclusion of the horrible, whiny singer Jean Michel Byron was Toto's worst mistake ever. Having said this, however, I've got to admit that Can You Hear What I'm Saying is an excelllent song and actually sounds like old-school Toto. I still don't like the fact that it was on this particular album, but if you're a fan of the first few albums, you've got to hear the song. Overall, those new to Toto would do much better to start off with Farenheit, IV, Isolation, or Hydra. For the die-hard, seasoned Toto fan, this disc might be worth picking up used for the one aforementioned song."
3,Okay Greatest Hits,"This isn't the best greatest hits collection I've ever heard. It has most of Toto's best songs on it, but the singer who sang the new songs included on this hits collection wasn't my taste. Overall an okay release. It's got some good tunes on it."
5,"""Africa"" SAYS IT ALL","I loved Toto in the 1980s and I love them more now. It's refreshing to go back in time once in a while and listen to old favorites like Hold the Line, Rosanna, Pamela, I Won't Hold You Back, 99. If you miss 80s music like I do, buy this CD."
2,Greatest Hits? NOT REALY,"Past to Present is poor greatest hits album in my opinion.There are five new songs,so that leaves 9 songs that are hits?This CD is very skimpy and lacks many of Toto's best songs.If you want to own a Toto CD you should buy Toto or IV,those are their best albums and they both represent the band much better than this CD."
3,OK Collection,"One thing that really annoys me about these so called ""Greatest Hits"" collections is that they leave out some key hits and replace them with songs never before released. Now, I don't want to confuse favorite tracks with actual hits, so lets stick to the hits that are missing from this collection.Songs like 1984's Stranger In Town, or 1978's I'll supply the love. There was also Why Don't We Make Believe from the TOTO IV album. This is a fairly good collection of hits. But a word to other groups. Try to put all of the actual hits on a disc. Then, if there's room left over, put some of the more popular album tracks that were not released as singles. It's time for another TOTO CD that deserves the title of Greatest Hits."
3,Missed Opportunity,"OK, of course the big hits are here, there's no sense in reviewing them since they're well known. I just can't understand why they can never do a decent job compiling ""Greatest Hits"" for these guys.Why in the world is the entire ""Isolation"" CD overlooked - I'd add ""How Does It Feel"", ""Holyanna"" and ""Stranger In Town"". Where is ""I'll Supply The Love""? That great song was all over the radio. Why is the ""Fahrenheit"" CD so poorly represented - I'd include ""We Can Make It Tonight"" or ""Could This Be Love"".Even the double CD import misses key tracks. Will someone ever get it right? C'mon, this isn't rocket science!!"
3,Premier Best-Of de TOTO.,"Il embarque quatre inédits chanté par un nouveau chanteur, Jean-Michel Byron.Toto entre dans l'ère Sony...Plus d'info sur : www.totofrance.com"
5,Toto,We aren't in Kansas anymore! Great album. Africa has got to be one of the best tracks that Toto ever recorded.
5,Past to Present 1977-1990 by Toto,Love every minute of this cd. It's music from my teenage years. Favorite song is Africa. Would say anyone would enjoy this music.
3,strange,"does anyone out there remember toto's amazing tune, ""stranger in town""? obviously the people in charge of toto compilations haven't. i remember it because it has the words ""sonofabitch"" and ""jesus"" in it. pretty edgy for a slick studio band.anyway, aside from this SERIOUS omission, you can't go wrong with hold the line and africa."
5,Some of Bennett's Finest,"This album tugged on my heartstring. I still prefer the style of someone like Sinatra, all the while conceding that Bennett is a fine talent in his own right, but the songs on this album grabbed my attention and held it. That is primarily because most of the songs are love songs and an all too familiar feeling swept over me on hearing them. Some are of unrequited love and others of love fulfilled. In any case, they are well done, emotional and a pleasure to hear... even bearing in mind the ""unrequited"" part.As is to be expected from an artist of this caliber, the quality of the recordings themselves match the quality of the lyrics, the singing and accompaniment. This is a fine selection for anyone who loves love songs done in an older style."
4,Another great W.A.S.P. cd,"The people slamming this cd don't know jack about good music. Don't even take anything they say to heart. If you like the sound of W.A.S.P. from the ""Headless Children on, you will love ""The Neon God"". I can hear elements from such greats as ""Still Not Black Enough"", ""Unholy Terror"", and especially ""The Crimson Idol"". Blackie sounds as good as ever. Frankie Banali, what can you say about him other than the fact that he is amazing. A great story put to great music. Highly recommended for those of you who appreciate a well thought out concept album."
2,Such a disappointment,"I love WASP as much as (probably more than) the next fan. I had high hopes for this cd especially since Blackie cancelled the DYING FOR THE WORLD tour to record it. Blackie, why didn't you just do the tour, man? I am sure this cd will grow on me after hearing it a few more times. But, as a first time listen, it is pretty bland."
1,Re:This album stinks!,"I still say the best wasp album is ""KFD"". Songs on this album just sound so redundant, it's comical. I was a big wasp fan a while back, but now, I'm not so sure. The last album from wasp stunk, too. Blackie should stick to the hard driving, fast paced kick ass music that wasp began with, instead of the wimpy keyboard, pity party sounding records that he now makes. I'll stick to ""KFD"", Helldrado"", and the like, if I want loud music. You can have this album."
2,A complete rip-off,"This is a heavy-metal ripoff of THE WHO. Listen closely, you'll hear Quadrophenia and Tommy riffs all over this album. The drummer cheaply imitates Keith Moon's playing, and the bass is trying so hard to be John Entwistle. The concept itself is poor, a complete rehash of what THE WHO did back in the 60's and 70's. Frankly, I'm shocked that the band haven't gotten sued for copyright infringement. Perhaps no one has noticed the similarities becasue of the trashy guitars and howlingly bad vocals. 2 stars for providing shock value--who else has the balls to rip off such a classic band?"
1,Who cares about the concept!,"The music is so ho hum on this record that I didn't even care enough to get into the concept. I also don't think it was recorded very well. The vocals are week and the music kinda runs together. I really haven't listened to WASP since ""Headless Chidren"" If this is an indication of how they've been sounding since that time then it's probably a good thing. Don't wast your money. It's not even good by todays standards."
1,The Neon Clod,"This album shows how bad, how completely irrelevant wasp has become. I heard a promo copy my friend has. There is no structure. Lyrically, it is a mess. The instuments are off time. I am stunned a label would release a part 2 ??? Don't waste your cash."
4,Crimson Idol Pt. 2?,"I'll try to be short and not go into the breakdown of the whole album, others have already done that. Simply put, this is a solid album - but, it is not as good as The Crimson Idol. Sister Sadie, Asylum #9, XTC Riders and The Raging Storm are some highlights. One thing of notice is that Blackie's vocals sound somewhat strained, he just doesn't sound as powerfull as on previous albums. This is a very minor issue though.This is a solid - though not great album, but Blackie making music is always a good thing. Definitely worth a purchase."
3,Maybe,Might work for others but I have not seen a change in my figure yet... at least helps me sleep :)
1,No Luck,"Did not change or do anything for me personally ,but everything isn't for everyone ill try something else in the mean time ."
5,RELACORE IT JUST WORKS,"I have been using RELACORE for approximately 2 1/2 months and it really works. I have lost more than half of my belly fat without any effort. Besides the physical results, I awaken refreshed and rejuvenated, with RELACORE there are no side effects just results. I have recommended RELACORE to numerous friends and family who have obtained similiar positive results, Try it, you have nothing to lose but the belly fat."
3,didn't work,"I followed the directions, cut my fat and carb intake, took a 30 minute brisk walk each day and lost nothing. I kept this up for two months and have had no results.I gave it three stars just because I had to give it something. I don't want to exactly say it was all Relacore that failed. It could be just me becuase I have tried just about every diet pill and ""buy our food"" diet without any success. I have also spent money on gyms with very little success.As far as taking the Relacore, I felt no side effects. No jitters, thirst, hunger, gas or other bowel problems."
3,"didn't get what i asked for, but great for myalgias.","well, as many of you know, they have changed the formula from a while back and then the packaging and now from capsule to tablet. I for one, take this not for weight loss but for the amazing job it does to get rid of my muscle aches/myalgias. with a side benefit of some energy. I quit taking this when they changed over to the tablet for it is hard to swallow them verses the capsules.so I contacted this seller and she informed me up and down that the picture shoes it is capsules and I defiantly will receive capsules....NOT.....I don't think anybody has any older boxes of the capsules, so I got the tablets.oh well, I now take it with milk and it is a little easier to swallow. Just wish that all of these sellers would change the PICTURES!"
4,Relacore PM by Carter-Reed 60 caps,this supplement is used by my wife and she's happy with it. It helps her control her weight gain by suppressing appetite and food cravings.
1,Dissapointing,relacore pm made my insomnia worse. I had to stop taking it by the third night. definately will to purchase again
3,Herbal200 was better than relacore,"I've tried every diet pill under the sun and relacore helped a little more than the others I've tried, but my friend who had lost 68 lbs had done it with [...] so I asked to try some of those. I've lost 10 lbs in 2 weeks already and unlike relacore, I have no hunger for food and absolutely no jitters or agitation. But Relacore may be a good choice for some."
5,Seems alright for me,I've been on Relacore PM for about a week. Lost about 5 lbs so far with changes plus the pills. I have noticed a little my anxiety level and stress level has been a bit more balanced. I need it now especially after a close death in my family which has been very good for me so far. And it has definetly knocked me out at night which is another good thing.I have had no side effects. No allergic reactions. No hair loss. So far its worked for me.
2,different than original,"Wish they never altered the formula of the original Relacore, that one worked well for me, kept me active & helped me maintain weight. Needless to say, this one didn't work anymore & didn't put me to sleep either. It's loaded with B-vitamins & that means you need to eat so those vitamins can be converted to energy. This is my experience, I tried it once, but I won't buy it again. Try it if you want & see if it works for you."
4,Calm,"In case it's helpful:Initially, I tried this product because of the (listed) ingredients and their potential impact on mood/calmness; that is, regardless of weight loss/cortisol benefits. Since then, I've taken Relacore for several years with brief intermittent breaks. There is no question that for me, (again, not concerned about or critically measuring belly or weight loss), the mood aspect is undeniable and beneficial. There may very well be other products out there with the same (mood) advantage, since it is likely due in large part to the B vitamins, but I've taken straight Bvits independently and not observed the same moderate effect had with Relacore."
2,Not what I was hoping for.,"I am 29 female. First night I couldn't really sleep. Ended up taking a PM sleep med as well. I did not and have not noticed any weight loss while taking this. I didn't change any habits, not did I include any exercise. With any diet supplement I would assume it works best when adding the exercise and diet change. Can't expect fat to just melt away without doing anything extra. Wouldn't that be nice! I didn't notice to much change in mood, stress or anxiety, nor did I notice any change in sleeping. I actually seemed to sleep better when I didn't take this and piggy back on PM sleep med. Just my experience. Try it and see if it is right for you."
2,not as good as the original,"i used the original version of this product both day and night and loved them! but the ""new and improved"" version sucks! it made me jittery and i could not sleep. and did not help at all. i waisted my money! they need to bring back the original!"
4,"All Alan, all the time!","I am an Alan Rickman devotee. If you are like minded, and wish his films featured him more, you will want to own it just for the fact that he is the main focus of this film. His hair looks wonderfully long and soft, and he makes some great, uh, facial expressions in this one. Watch it and you'll see what I mean...The film itself is a bit lacking, but who cares-- it stars our Alan. 'Nuff said."
3,Mesmer,"Any movie with Alan Rickman is worth seeing, because he always puts everything he has into any performance. This is a movie I would not have seen if Alan Rickman weren't starring. The backdrops in Vienna were visually stunning. However, this is a movie about a doctor who was incompetant and didn't even know he was incompetant. This is a historical piece thus there are no significant conflicts in this film except between Mesmer and his wife and Mesmer and the rest of the medical community."
2,Historically Inaccurate,"While there is no complaint about the acting and sets on this movie, this Hollywood script is wildly, ridiculously and sadly inaccurate. I'm giving it two stars instead of one because Alan Rickman, the lead actor, gives a sensitive performance; unfortunately--and probably not his fault--the character he portrays has nothing to do with the historical Mesmer, who most acknowledge as the father of hypnosis.I advise my hypnosis students to avoid watching this film at all costs. A far better depiction of Mesmer and his famous baquettes, although only taking up a small portion of the movie, can be found by watching James Ivory's fabulous film, ""Thomas Jefferson in Paris,"" starring Nick Nolte as Thomas Jefferson (perfect casting; who would've guessed it?!) and featuring a young Gwyneth Paltrow.Booklet: The Amazing Doctor Mesmer (Hypnosis and Guided Imagery)"
5,Rickman the consummate actor,"This movie is a must for any Alan Rickman fan. Beautiful sets, costumes, but most important acting. Rickman is fabulous as is Amanda Ooms. I never knew who Anton Mesmer was until I looked up this movie. After reading about him, I researched. Interesting to say the least. The movie was quite good. However, if you love Rickman, you need to see this. Eyes, voice, hands...very expressive and he makes love to the camera in all of his scenes. This was made before ""Sense and Sensibility"", but brings to mind the era or at least the genre."
2,Why?,"Given the fact that the subject matter should have been fascinating and that Alan Rickman was the star, why was I disappointed in this movie? I'll tell you why--because the events in the film were confusing enough without a barely audible dialogue. By the end of the movie I wondered why I sat through the whole thing. Go ahead and rent this at your local video store if you don't have anything else to do, but don't buy it."
1,save your money,"I ordered this film because I am a huge Alan Rickman fan; but, it is is so poorly written and edited that even Rickman's formidable screen presence and acting ability can't redeem this abyssmal mess."
3,Mesmer,"This historical drama about Dr. Mesmer of Vienna (mesmerism) is only mildly rewarding, because it doesn't take a stand on the question: Was he a genius or a con man? It is frustrating to see several major events in his life played out, only to be left wondering....and not really caring. Maybe he was a misunderstood healer, ahead of his time. Or, maybe, he was a slick operator who tried to fool his clients. Unfortunately, this movie never resolves the question. Alan Rickman is terrific, as always, and I recommend this film to his fans."
2,What was that?,"Even Alan Rickman couldn't save this conglomeration of images which attempted to depict the life and times of Franz Anton Mesmer. Truly an interesting story, Mesmer's life is not well portrayed by this movie. Unless you are already well acquainted with Mesmer and his theories, watching this movie will not explain any of the man's intriguing ideas. In fact, I found myself more confused by the end of the movie than before I'd begun watching it!The sound was not good at all for a portion of the movie and it was very hard to hear some of the dialogue adding to the overall confusion. There were some exquisite uses of light and shadow- very artistic. But alas, the movie ends very suddenly without explanation of any sort and left me sitting there with open mouth and a blank expression. Maybe I had been mesmerized. I often am mesmerized by Alan Rickman!"
2,I'm gonna get crucified for this,"I've extolled how amazing Alan Rickman is in just about everything he's ever been in. He can take a bad script and turn it into gold just with his delivery. But in this movie, he went WAY over the top, and not in a good Sheriff of Nottingham way. There were times when I felt he wasn't chewing scenery, he was swallowing it whole!"
1,"Charlaton, fraud, or genius?","I'd say moron, based on this movie. This character was a joke, as was the whole film. I might reccomend it as being so bad it's funny, but most of it is just boring as all get out and badly acted. Rickman makes Mesmer seem ridiculous, it's like a parody of his role as Rasputin (which is much, much better). The few scenes that are entertaining are that way because they're (unintentionally?) funny, such as the mass-hypnosis scene towards the end which is totally absurd. This is a weak, craptastic movie."
5,A singularly exceptional contribution to dance DVD libraries,"Baroque Dance Unmasked: Workshop to Performance is a DVD documentary that lives up to its title by taking the viewer on an inside tour of Catherine Turocy's Baroque Ballet Workshop, where 18th century dance practices are preserved and taught. Every step of the process from studio to stage is revealed, as Turocy explains her process for reviving and preserving the elegance of period dance. Performance excerpts with period costuming and music courtesy of Concert Royal enhance this singularly exceptional contribution to dance DVD libraries. 48 min."
4,Cool CD!,"I absolutely love mixes where they tweek these great songs so it becomes a great dance track! I listen to this when I work out and blast it in the car! This CD will ""bring you back"", but with flavor!"
4,Good but examples mostly in C#,"I think this is a good book for an introduction to the new features of ASP+ (ASP.Net). The topics it covers, such as data binding, controls, and Web services, really focus on the new features that make ASP.Net so powerful. The only problem that I had with the book is that most of the examples, especially towards the end with the more complex chapters, were all written in C#. Since I have never written a line of C++ this made things a little more difficult for me to understand. I would have liked to see the Wrox team show all the examples in C# and VB throughout the entire book, or at least a better mix. Overall though the book was worth it - thinking about the applications that I have written, I was really able to see what the changes would be and how they could help web applications."
1,session variables,"According to Ch. 9 all session variables are there for, is to write debug pages. Whoa! that's VERY interesting, however I would have thought that, just maybe, there is more to that than what this book offers, not. A very disappointing manual as a whole, and particurlarly annoying when one realises than the only reason this book is as thick as it is, is due not to content, but use of large fonts and continual repetitions. Not to be recommended."
5,Great book to get started,This is a great book (as to be expected from Alex Homer) for beginning to understand .Net and ASP+. It doesn't go into the .Net framework in too much detail but explains how ASP has progressed to ASP+ and ADO to ADO+. A must read for any ASP devloper who wants to move to .Net
2,not worth ordering,had to send the first pair back because they were broke. when i got the second set they were broke too. your better off going to a car shop
1,Doesn't Do the Job,Does not work as advertised. Could not use both desk top monitor and laptop monitor simultaneously. This works strictly as a USB hub.
4,"Boy, could this guy play a trumpet...","One of my favorite musicians and for good reasons. Harry James probably had control over the trumpet better then anyone in his time! I would say the band he had in 1943 was the best. And the female singers were excellent also. Helen Forrest, Kitty Kallen and Betty Grable. Dick Haymes did the male singing. This album shows off the band and singers very well with songs like ""I've heard that song before"", "" I cant begain to tell you,"" Ciribiribin"" to name a few. I would say to anyone who liked the music of this era to buy this album. Dont think you could go wrong."
4,Thanks Dad,"As the title suggests I owe a big part of why I like Big Band Music to my dad.He grew up listening to it and as a result so did I. I usually just stick with purchasing The Best of Recordings.My favorites are Benny Goodman,Artie Shaw. But I dont think you can go wrong with any of them. Great music by talented musicians that put you in a good mood.They all put today's so called artists to shame. Enjoy."
1,"Awesome Music, Awful Linear Notes","For such an important set of recordings of such an important artist and from such an important label (Columbia), I am EXTREMELY disappointed that the CD's linear notes do not contain any factual information about the recordings. If Columbia cannot be bothered to put in the requisite recording information data about each track (location, date, and personnel involved), information about when the individual track's were released, and information about how the individual track charted (information about whether the individual track was used in a movie or whether it followed or preceded the same song by another artist would also be nice to know).... well, should we bother? Columbia, treat your legacy and your audience with more respect and if you don't have an archivist, well, hire one!"
3,"Body Glove Scuba II Cellphone Case for Palm Treo 680, 750","Good: Received on time, good product.Bad: Problem to use the touch screen with the case."
4,can i get reimbursed?,"Took about as long as directions mentioned to install. The only complaint that I have is that the breather hose that K & N provided was to short so I had to buy one, costed me another $20 that I shouldnt have had to spend. Does sound amazing when you really get on the gas. I've been getting about 1 mpg better since I installed."
4,Spicy Ramen,nothing else to say My grandson loved it He collects these fiqures and is crazy about anime.
4,Braysia's Review,"As I began to read the book, the story seemed to be boring with historical fiction. Once I got further into the book I began to enjoy the story of Jip's courage and could not stop reading. The book is about endurance and strength. I enjoyed the book because it was adventurous and was filled with action. I loved it and you will too."
3,JIP,This book is pretty confusing. I read the first 5 chapters and it was kind of confusing i didnt get some of the words and they were talking 'Country Talk' which made it hard and wierd. I really didnt get the book.
5,The Perfect Book to Read ...,The book is very fasinating. The book is about a boy's young life growing up on a poor farm. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading. Jip's name supposedly came from him falling off a Gypsy wagon. On the poor farm he tends a lunatic and some animalsBrock E.
4,"almost, but not quite","Jip is a good book, but not a great one. The pace at the beginning is very slow -- too slow for its target audience of 9-12 year olds. Jip's revelation comes late in the book and seems too lightly dealt with to be realistic. The end of the story is a page-turner, but the epilogue is truly a cheat -- it left me thinking ""that's IT?!?"""
4,Jip: His Story,"This is an excellent historical fiction novel. It takes place in 1855-1856 in Vermont. It is great for teaching about the Underground Railroad and how it worked. It really gives readers a sense of how it must have felt for any young people who traveled by foot afraid of being caught by slavers. This book is very action packed, especially toward the end of the book when he begins his journey to freedom. The book addresses so many conflicts, such as when he finds out he is part African. He also faces a struggle in society, since he is to be sold as a slave now that his identity is discovered. The book is told using Jip's point of view, and this really gives the reader of sense of how he feels. This is truly an educational and exciting book and I reccommend it to many teachers and students."
5,Jip will stay in your heart long after its been read,"Katherine Paterson has taken pen in hand again and written more than a just a great book ... she has written a part of each of us. We find ourselves in Jip's pain and joy. He leaps into our hearts and crawls into our conscience until we are unable to put the book down. It has to be read because we must know too ... why was he dropped off the wagon and abandoned? Who would do such a thing and why? From where does his gentle and loving spirit come from ... the spirit that each of us hungers to find in ourselves. Read Jip ... not because it's ""one of the best"" (it is!), but because you be less if you don't!"
4,A Good Ending!,Jip his story is a good book. I recommend it to people who like books that are historical fiction. The end was good but the beginning was a little slow and did not grasp my attention right away.
2,A Okay Book,"I thought Jip was an okay book. It's about a kid named Jip who fell off a wagon. Jip was brought to a poor farm. He did the chores and one day a lunitc came. Caged like an animal, his name is Put. Put and Jip became friends as weeks go by. A stranger came to town ands claims to be Jip's father. With Put's help they try to put Jip's past together.- Dylan O. (13)"
3,Book is good once you get going,this book takes a long time for you to get into it because it goes through so much discription in the beginning.
5,Moving tale of slavery's ugly hand. Paterson does it again!,"To be orphaned without a past is bad enough.To lose the only people you identify with as family is even worse. Jip is a story of courage, determination and the will to survive at a young persons level of understanding. A must for later el. and middle school students!"
3,NOT what I hoped,"I wanted it to be attention grabbing, but no! It was good writing, but quite boring! I dragged through it!!"
3,Jip--not up to par,"I was quite disappointed--a good story but a slooowww beginning. I had to force myself to keep reading. About half way through the book, it got better. Although Jip is a good story, you must stick it out through the first half--it does get better. Not a Paterson great in my opinion."
1,Jip his story about nothing,This book was lame. The only part I liked was when Sheldon got shot.The lunatic was not crazy. Why did Jip have to fall of a wagon? After a while it got a little better.I am never going to read this again .I can not relate to this story.Jip got adopted by his school teacher.That was real good for him.
1,Ryan my story,"This was lame.I only liked it when Sheldon got shot........actually that and the town drunk was the only excitement.Everyone knew this was the most predictable ever. You knew the teacher was going to adopt him as soon as the words ""I like you"" fell out his mouth.overall I didn't like this book.Thats why I didn't rate this book."
2,wrong onesie shipped to me,"I ordered this onesie and they shipped me a different one. It worked out fine because it says ""My Aunt Rocks"" - and I am the aunt..."
2,Binding isn't quality,"I went through two of these thinline Bibles by B&H; within the course of one year. The Binding totally separates from the cover within no time. I avoid B&H; publisher's Bibles because of this. I think there are other publishers (Zonervan, Nelson, etc)with thinline Bibles and they hold up ten times better.Hope this helps someone to avoid my mistake :)"
5,Great for traveling and less side effects,"I have used this product for 8 years now. The regular medication available for motion sickness does not work for me because it makes me drowsy and tired. I am sensitive with medications. This medication is wonderful, I get no side effects with it and it does the job. The service was wonderful"
1,Doesn't work!,This product made me sick! My throat was swollen and I came dizzy I had hard time swallowing had body aches couldn't get much sleep it happened 10 minutes after I took the pill and to be honest it didn't work on me I recommend not to get this go to your local supermarket and buy pills there do not order online you don't know who it's from
5,Bonine is amazing!,"Bonine was recommended to me by a boat captain on a fishing trip in the Keys where three people got sea sick. We just went on another fishing trip in Miami and took Bonine for two days before the trip and on the morning of each fishing day. We fished two full days, in very choppy waters, and those same people did not experience one minute of sickness. As a matter of fact, we also didn't have the wobbly feeling that night when we were on shore. That is a first! I can highly recommend this product."
4,it works,I suffer from motion sickness can't go on long trips without getting sick tried this product and it works will busy again
2,Lower Quality Cable,"I'm a low voltage cable installer and this is one of the lower quality cables i have used. I have bought CAT5E cables from cables to go before and they were great. But this time the jacket is a lot thinner than before and kinks very easily, although the wires are easier to work. But i would still prefer a thicker jacket and higher quality cable."
3,Lacks pizazz,"The video is basically watching a yoga class for kids who are in a field of a park. The teacher does talk directly to the camera, with some nice close-ups, but otherwise it often feels amateurish. The music that they tout is just a woman singing with a guitar, and it's so soft that it's overpowered by the kids' giggles in the video. And the music is not a motivating factor, instead it's more background noise. Although I wasn't impressed with it, my son (who is 6) chooses it over ""Silly to Calm,"" which is what I like better (it's more professional, and the visuals and music are more dynamic). But I think he likes this one because at one point they pretend to drive in a car, and he also likes the Dead Man's pose. (My daughter, who is 4, seems to be able to stick more with ""Silly to Calm"") Since I bought it for the kids, it's not a total failure, I just wished it was more pleasing to me!"
2,For young children only,"I was looking for a yoga video for my 9-year old daughter. All the videos I found were for adults or younger children. This video was reviewed by another buyer who said that her pre-teen enjoyed it as well. Based on this review, I bought it. My daughter doesn't use it because she feels silly exercising with children half her age. The video is truly meant for a child."
3,Ok but not so captivating,"My 7yr old boy wasn't so captivated by this. He's very energetic, and I wanted him to take a time a day to relax after school. So far we've only used this once (in a week since we got it) and I think the way the video is done doesn't help kids concentrate on the postures. I think it would be better to model the correct position for more seconds than focusing on the kids each doing their own interpretation of what the adult is modelling. Nevertheless, I think the routine has a good length, as kids would get tired if it were longer, or might find it dissapointing if it were shorter. I also think the exercises aren't too hard to do, in general."
3,kids yoga,"The kids like it a lot. Its like a homemade DVD, cute and entertaining. My 2 and 5 yr. old really enjoy it. My 9 yr. old thinks it a bit silly....but will do it if everyone is doing it.I am going to look for another one that I want to do with them. It all depends on what kind of parent you are. My mother in law would LOVE doing this with the kids, she is much more hands on than myself.Its a fun DVD...good way to introduce yoga or add to your collection.The music is pleasant with guitar and vocals. Not annoying."
4,Still Going Strong,"Another very good CD from Charlie Daniels. From the opening track of ""A Few More Rednecks"" to the final notes of ""It's My Life"" there are no weak songs here.On this CD, like so many others, Charlie captures the essence of the working man. The attitude with lines like ""yes I drive a pick up truck and I'm full of American Pride"" and ""I'd hang him up high on a short piece of rope and let him swing till the sun goes down"" - a little vigilante justice for a drug dealer who got off. The loneliness associated with a truck driver on ""Mister DJ"" and the thoughts back to old partying times ""Was It 25 or 26"".This album has soul running through it and will be an excellent addition to anyone who likes music. It's a ""new classic""."
2,Where's the fire?,"As much as I've tried to like the new Charlie that has recorded over the past few years, the truth is that just like several of his more recent albums, this one leaves me wanting. Oh, the production's fine and the playing is fine, but the fire of the content of the material is just not there for me. I long for the days of old when Charlie wrote more about the real issues that plagued the common man in songs like ""Land of Opportunity"" and ""Grapes of Wrath"" and left out the formula driven pablum that seems to be the normal fare for him and most of the other remaining Southern Rock artists. Charlie, the fans that loved and supported you in the 70's are still there... and we're waiting for your return."
1,Doesn't fit the Fein 9-20-26 Turbo III 15-Gallon Wet/Dry Vacuum,"Although shown as an accessory for my Vacuum (the Fein 9-20-26 Turbo III 15-Gallon Wet/Dry Vacuum) it will only fit on a much smaller hose than the 2 1/2"" hose that comes with the Turbo III. I sent it back."
3,adaptor,"I expected it to be a larger diamater, but it will work fine on my sander port. I must have missed the noted size when I ordered it."
4,Best Vacuum Adapter . . . Ever,"Every other vacuum adapter I've tried doesn't ""quite fit"" the tools I'm trying to hook to my shop vac. The Fein Step Adaptor is made of a soft rubber that is not only stepped to reasonably useful sizes, but that also stretches to fit when the step you've cut it off at is just a tad small. Great gadget. The down side? Pricey!"
3,Lost episodes,A true lover of the Honeymooners (Originals) would notice that this book contains mostly lost episode trivia.The book is very well put together. The fact finding and pictures must have been a tremendous task.My search is still on for a trivia book that contains only the original episodes.Have you created a household utensil to do the work of all of these?Humman a humman a humman a.Can it core A apple?Long live the Honeymooners. (the new movie will not do the show justice.)
5,Tremenda produccion! Tal como ella.,Corazon es una produccion tan profunda la cual considero perfecta. Ednita una vez mas demuestra ese gran talento con el cual te lleva mas alla de realidad haciendote sentir cuan maravilloso es el estar profundamente entregado al amor. Ednita te deseo lo mejor de este mundo.
3,Prefiero sus discos anteriores...,"Para el que quiere oir a Ednita con energia y sensualidad, le recomiendo ""Espiritu Libre"" y ""Pasiones""... Este es un buen disco, pero los 2 anteriores me parecieron mas atrevidos y apasionados."
3,Oddities about Ohio,"I was a little disappointed with this book. The seller was great but the book left much to be desired. As a life long resident of this state, many things were left out and some items were just too old to be of any value for this age."
2,how to ruin a great story,Apparently the author was unaware of the word brevity or minutiae. I am major fan of baseball and sports. This read felt like I was reading a daily diary. What a boring book. It was a hard read. I can read Walter Johnson's pitching records in any baseball encyclopedia. The grandson became bogged down in details that didn't move the story along. I didn't need to read about which minor league team had good fly fishing nearby or which had good food.I sure hope that The Big Train wasn't as boring in real life as he was in the book!
1,Nepotism At Its Worst,"This book was written by Walter Johnson's grandson, for the sole purpose of refuting Bill James' stated opinion--absolutely standard among baseball history experts--that Lefty Grove is the greatest pitcher of all time. While James has since reluctantly changed his mind, very few of the rest of us have. Johnson ""pitched"" when a pitcher only had to bear down on about 15 or 20 pitches per game; Grove pitched when any pitch could be hit out of the park, and lobbing in all of your pitches was suicidal. Grove won 9 ERA titles, all of them while pitching in hitters' parks, including 4 as a southpaw in Fenway Park after his 35th birthday; Johnson won 5 in a pitcher's paradise.So the book's biased premise is not only flawed, but untenable. Poor writing, presented in support of a nepotistic agenda, makes for a poor read. Sorry, Grandsonny, but Grove was better, and both Pedro and Roger Clemens may prove to have been better yet, when they are done.Jim Fahey"
1,yes... seriously.. this is an actual band...,"I know, I couldn't believe it either. This is an ACTUAL band, that happens to make incredibly awful music. It shouldn't come as a surprise to you though.. this is just one of the countless no talent, un-original groups that exist in the world today. Even if you are a sucker for pop/emo music, this band won't satisfy you one bit.. unless you enjoy bad music."
3,It could be better...but I've heard worse,"Okay, so on a whim I started listening to this band, ATFEH. On the whole, I liked some of what I heard. ""Pretty When You Cry,"" ""Things Aren't So Beautiful part 2,"" ""A Night to Remember, A Morning to Forget,"" and ""February"" are by far their best songs. The other ones...ehhhh...like I said, I've heard worse. The songs I've mentioned are the best ones and the best example of their talent.I'm not going to be mean and say they aren't talented, or that they sound like every other band out there...although in their other songs, they do. But, my point is...they're not bad...but you have to be in the mood to listen to the whole thing with out skipping tracks."
2,I really want to like it...,"...but the production is just terrible. Think demo quality, but worse. Seriously, this band has MAJOR potential, but 'things aren't so beautiful now' sounds like it was recorded underwater and dried off in cow s**t. Hopefully album number 2 (coming soon) will bring out the full potential with atleast halfway descent production/mixing and editing."
2,A Thorn For Every Heart - Things Aren't So Beautiful Now,"Chino Hill's A Thorn for Every Heart with ""Things Aren't So Beautiful Now,"" have launched themselves head-first in to a career that's sure to be marked by mediocre release after mediocre release. Eventually their rarely catchy and even less often amusing brand of screamo-pop will drown right along with all the other bands who believe using the word ""beautiful"" in a negative sense is an edgy tactic to get kids hooked on their music. This debut full length on Kickball Records is background, high school party music at best. There is some obvious instrumental talent displayed here; but in the end, the majority of the tracks are downright nauseating. Noteworthy: ""Next of Kin.""2/5"
2,DVD,The Last Supper: Live at the Hammerstein BallroomDon't know a thing about this product. Was ask to buy it for someone for christmas.........hasn't been delivered to them yet but it is what they ask for me to buy for them. I aim to please!!!!!!!i rated it & the T-shirt but honestly I don't know a thing about this group but the person who's getting it apparently likes them a lot!!!!!
2,Winter's Bone,"The movie was boring. There is a reason why it grossed so little (about twelve million dollars or so as I recall). I then bought the book to see if the book was better than the movie. Nope.But Jennifer Lawrence played her role well. The setting of the movie (in a very poor part of the country), and the type of character Jennifer played was similar to the role of Katniss Everdeen in ""The Hunger Games"". I think she may have been selected to play Katniss specifically because of her performance in Winter's Bone."
3,Winter's Bone,Was filmed very close to us and really wanted to see it...moved kind'va slow but think it really had to because of the story.
5,it's real....,"People who don't believe that this life exists in U.S. are living in ignorance. Having lived in Oklahoma and Missouri most of my life, when not in the backwoods of Indiana I've known people who have walked this trail. Hard times make people do hard things, and when people come knocking with the eviction notice the government, welfare, etc. don't help. I haven't lived it, but I've observed it, some with people I grew up with. I just don't know how to change it."
1,Do not rent!,Very gruesome and bothersome! Do not rent this movie if you are not prepared to be disturbed. I had no idea it would be like it was!
2,Can't believe this got such high marks!!!,"Kept waiting for something to happen. Riveting - I don't think so. More of a slice of ""Deliverance"" life than a thriller. The acting was well done, but I have to honestly say that I was extremely disappointed after what I read and having such high hopes. Good, but not great storytelling. Could have been done better."
1,Too boring,"I know this movie got great reviews and I was looking forward to watching it. I was so turned off by the dragging story line. A 17 year old girl who is put upon to take care of her two siblings and wacked out non verbal Mother. The girl wanders all through the woods going to different homes mumbling about looking for her Dad, an apparent ""crack cooker"" whom we never see. She wants to prove he is dead so the family homestead is not lost. The characters were played too flat no emotion, I kept waiting for the real story to start...... Disappointment!"
5,Very good movie,"I thought the story line was better than average. The acting was superb, my wife kept asking if those were real life people and not actors. This movie is definitely worth a look."
3,"Depressing, well-shot, at times remarkably poignant","Jennifer Lawrence and John Hawkes are brilliant. The scenery is dreadfully Meth-Country but the film is a bit too brooding and removed for its own good. Aesthetics only do so much to cover a familiar narrative. Despite the realistic locales, most movie-goers will recognize too much, be enthralled in too little. When the chase through the ominous rodeo pen arrives to draw Lawrence's journey from its slogging progression, it is almost too late to salvage things. The ending does reward the patient, in a subdued, unsettling manner. In fact, the ending stings. Family endures. After its over, expect to feel cold inside."
5,Great DVD,"Well worth your time to watch this DVD, Jennifer Lawrence is one of if not the Best young actress to come along in recent times!Catch her DVD Hunger Games, you will not be disappointed watching either of the DVD's!"
1,TV movie,"A TV movie. ""You'd better find your Daddy, or you're going to lose the farm.""Later: ""You'd better PROVE your Daddy is dead, or you're going to lose the farm.""The only thing missing here is Bruce McGill as the bad DA, Billy Bob Thornton as the good hillbilly, and perhaps Scott Glenn as a good/bad patriarch.The only surprise in the movie is that the father actually is dead. Right up to the end I expected him to make an appearance.Predictable, boring, stereotyped. As the movie goes on the dialogue becomes longer and more laborious, a sure sign that the director and screenwriter were out of their depth.The female lead does have a certain Renée Zellwegger quality. If that allows you to watch it to the end, more power to you.Not for serious movie lovers. See it at the drive-in."
1,The Wizard Of Oz,"I'm sorry but I just couldn't get into this movie. It's billed as a ""thriller"" but it's nowhere near that. It reminded me of ""The Wizard of Oz"" like Dorthey going all over the place to no end looking for the Oz, but here it's Ree looking for her father. This film was quite dull and uneventful and nearly put me to sleep. They didn't even show Ree chainsawing her father's hands off at the end. At least show us something memorable and gory after we spent hours watching her look for this guy. Another thing is I'm not into any movie that deals with the crystal meth thing. I don't find it entertaining and I don't want to go down that road! I guess I was disillusioned, especially hearing it had Oscar buzz and all that. Different strokes for different folks."
2,Slow and boring.,"You know a movie is bad when you keep checking your watching every 5 or 10 minutes. That's exactly what I did as I was watching this dud. The ending was predictable. I lost interest whether the girl would find her father or not. (Frankly, I didn't care after a certain point.) I found little to no character development. This movie is very overrated. I know a lot of people will probably say that they liked the themes of how sometimes we have to do what we don't like to do in life and the importance of hope. I say: big deal. Don't waste your time or money seeing this dud."
5,Great indie flick,"I actually really liked this film. It was a little slow to start, but I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It's a slow paced film and very true to life. Jennifer Lawrence gives an amazing performance. Has a neat ending."
2,depressing as hell,Jennifer Lawrence great actress but story line was very depressing. Feel like I wasted 2 hours of my life. I would pass.
2,Winter's Bone,"I know this movie got 5 stars, but I just didn't care for it. Might have something to do with remembrances of growing up in Southwest Virginia. Same reason I have an aversion to country music, I guess. Maybe if I'd viewed it from a different perspective I'd have liked it. So go ahead, watch it, and you'll probably like it just fine. 5 stars! Who can argue with that?"
1,Not a date night movie,"I would not recommend this movie, The cover looks like a great flick but the movie it self is a long drawn-out level of poverty."
1,"The most overrated actress since - well, since ever","I love art house and foreign movies, so it was a no brainer that I'd rent this.It was boring. And this Jennifer Lawrence person, is not a great actress. She's nothing.And now she is dressing like a vixen and trying to be a sex symbol. She is no great beauty.I see women more attractive than her working at Target.Get real people, this movie and this actress are nothing to be impressed with."
1,"""Art"" in the worst sense","I'm sure there's a great movie to be made about crank cookers -- but this sure isn't it. I have no idea how ""authentic"" or accurate it is, but in trying to make it feel oh-so authentic and (ugh) important, the filmmakers left out all the creativity. There's not a single charged or surprising moment in the entire movie, with the exception of the chainsaw scene, and that's only thanks to the yuk factor. This film is a great example of what happens when someone with little narrative talent or feel for character thinks they're making ""art"". Pointless."
1,Read the book,"The book on which the movie is based is a true original with a strong heroine and some edgy villians who engage in over the top violence. The language is steeped in metaphor and the sound of the Ozarks. The movie looks like it was made by a film school drop out. The lead character is way to soft for the part, the violence is expurgated and we never even see who makes crank and how they do it."
1,I personally did not enjoy it,"It was not clear to me that this movie's purpose is to educate us about the effect of methamphetamines in rural communities, as other reviewers have said, or I wouldn't have watched it. It turned out to be about how a girl survives with a sick mother, two little siblings and no father, in an area where, other than her neighbor and one friend, everyone is evil and horrible to her. Very depressing. The girl's acting was ok, but the story was terrible. It makes Missouri look like an awful place with terrible people. I've been to Missouri, and I thought people were all nice and happy, not ugly, fat and depressed like the people in this movie. The homes are a lot prettier and happier, and yes, they do have running water! Missouri people ought to complain. Perhaps the book is a lot a better. I'm sorry I wasted my time with this movie."
2,Depressing but realistic,"Rhee is almost the same character as she is in the Hunger Games -- Katniss. I can imagine the setting as District 12, after her father dies. Her mother is in a catatonic, useless state. Rhee, unlike Katniss also has a little brother. Rhee teaches her younger siblings how to survive by teaching them how to hunt squirrels and how to make deer stew. I know this isn't the same story, but it's uncanny how this setting can almost be a surrogate for Katniss' history. Otherwise, it's full of depressing meth-addicted toothless characters."
2,disappointed,not what i expected. the main actress was excellent in the movie. but this movie dragged on . you could wait for it to come on tv. not worth the purchase
5,Raw & Gritty,This video introduced me to the harsh realities that plague the under class of America. It was a well written movie and the main character pulled off an amazing performance. I was immediately taken on a wild journey which left me feeling dirty and mentally exhausted. Thank You!!! ;)
2,Interesting film but...,"Although I enjoyed the nature and subject matter I did not enjoy watching this film. It was long and painful to watch at certain periods. Although I admired the main character, her determination and her grit, there were somethings that were hard to follow. I wish some characters were explained more thoroughly. And family ties... another confusing aspect of this move."
1,Winters bone,"If there was a way, I would give it a half of a star or a quarter of a star. It has to be one of the worst movies ( if you want to call it that) that I have ever sat through. I could not see any good reason that someone went to all the trouble to film it. I have to stop now before I...............well I had better just stop. don't bother to watch it, it is just a big waste of time."
3,Brand New Movie but appears to be flawed....,"I liked the movie but when I placed the DVD in my player it made a loud (almost moaning) sound for a couple of minutes but then it went away only to start again at the beginning of the movie for a couple more minutes. This was a brand new movie...never used so I don't know what the problem is. When the sound first began, I took the movie out and placed another one in my DVD player to see if that was the problem but it was not. It's the new DVD itself."
3,Satisfactory,"This movie was OK, but I can't recommend it to anyone. I think it was nominated, but did not receive any awards."
3,Scary,"If one were to take the women from this film and combine them with the women from ""The Fighter"", you would scare the hell out of people. Our heroine is tough. And has no need ""to man up"" as she is advised. The cast gives different looks at some actors many people know from comedies. This one remains with you. It ain't pretty. But take a look."
3,"A very cold, slow, drama.","A very cold, slow, drama. Artsy flick, perhaps, but no way a must see. If you are not aware of poverty and what it looks like out in the country, then perhaps you should watch some of this but otherwise, just not enough of anything in this movie that desires attention. Was so shocked with ??? lead girl/lady was nominated for Academy Award for her role, acting. If you a big, slow drama, fan, watch it, otherwise, skip this one."
2,Going... going... nowhere,"""Winter's Bone"" is about as dry as one. It's a plodding, poorly-paced movie that did nothing for me.It earns a star for the performances, which seemed natural throughout, but the actors are portraying undefined characters. Few of them have known, clear motives and practically none have any back story, and it turns out to be the movie's main weakness. That mystery of the character's intentions, rather than intriguing me, made scenes confusing and disjointed. You learn very little about the other players, and by the end (well, probably 25 minutes from the end), I had stopped caring entirely.It's not a thrilling thriller or a dramatic drama. There are moments in the movie that work, and I did end up feeling for Ree and her struggling family, but when it was over, this movie was wholly forgettable."
2,Winters Sleep,Wanted to add to watchlist but mistakenly entered buy which is strange as I was looking throughAmazon Prime list. AList of free movies.Unfortunately now own this movie. Slow story.Bad ending. I wouldnt waste money on this one
2,Don't see it,"I can honestly say I don't see what all the hype is about in regards to this movie. I thought it was slow, dreary and had a hard time putting the pieces together. I grew up in this geographical region so maybe that is why all in the movie comes as no surprise to me. I will admit that Lawrence's performance is quite good, but the movie itself is not that appealing."
5,"Hard, frightening, and worth every minute","If you missed this treasure when it was released, see it now. A heartbreaking story unfolds in a threatening and impoverished world where good does not always triumph over violence, but the struggle reveals humanity's deep capacity for kindness, sacrifice, and redemption."
5,A window into a dark and otherwise unseen world,"Don't read any more reviews. They will only tell you too much about the film, and potentially ruin many of the shocking moments and insights into this rural world unknown and unseen by most. Buy or rent or stream this movie! It's absolutely one of the year's best!"
5,Great Characters,"4.5 stars. A story of courage and how sometimes being courageous is the only option. A visually interesting film, with beautiful connections to the symbolism in Nature. Film reveals a depth within characters and their conflicted motivations. The plot is driven strictly from characters' motivations, as it tends to do in Life. Shows how corruption softens the weak and yet they go right on glossing over their rotten bits which in turn fester with fear and insecurity. Until someone has the tenacity, courage and conviction to revolutionize the landscape and let the Truth come to light. A thought-provoking film about the content of character. I highly recommend this film, while it does deal in grim realities, it is not boring or difficult to watch, really pulled this viewer in."
5,One of the Best,I got this long before Jennifer Lawrence was everywhere. It is now one of my favorite all time movies and she is amazing.
5,Love Jennifer Lawrence,"This movie captures my interest on several levels and it's rated multiple views per week. The performances, music and setting are all compelling, intriguing and somehow addictive to me. I own Hunger Games, anticipate the next installments of that franchise and can't wait to view Silver Linings Playbook."
4,Must see,excellent movie. Shows how drugs affect everything. Deadly and wide spread. It was very realistic. The actors seemed to have had knowledge before the ovie.
4,Winter's Bone,"I purchased this because this movie received excellent reviews from just about every critic. I liked it but did not love it, so I was a little disappointed. I'll have to watch it again. The two lead actors Jennifer Lawrence and John Hawkes ARE excellent as are all the other actors in this film. Really good performances. I guess what I didn't care for is it's pace is slightly slow but does come up with some interesting twists and turns."
3,Read the Book,"I know, the book is always better....but in some cases it might be worhwhile just to bypass the movie. No spoilers here, but where was all the snow and cold? Rhea's(?) journey/story was surrounded with an icy, cold Hell, but in the movie it's almost springtime, or autumn; and, unfortunately, that's just one missing element of ambience.It's really, really hard to capture the nuance of the written work and transform into visual, but it has been done, sometimes wonderfully. Not so much here. I liked the book so much I bought the DVD w/out a 2nd thought; try renting it first, is my advice...the book is so much better."
4,Where do you live?,this is an excellent book if you live in an area (mountains of the east)where these techniques can be used. And if you are in shape for this hunting style.
3,"Old classic, but there are better guides","I remember my father reading this in the 70s, and it is well known. I am in Maine and I am new to deer hunting as an adult. The advice and information is not as good as Hal Blood's Hunting Big Woods Bucks if you are trying to learn about deer hunting. I would recommend it as an addition to a library or as an entertaing read."
4,Definitely worth adding to the collection.,"I am glad to see this classic back in print. It has been referred to as a deerhunters bible. I ordered it and it was an easy enjoyable read. However, I agree with a previous reviewer that Hal Bloods book it better. This is not a knock against the Benoit book, Hals is just better. Try them both!"
5,Excellent everything,I even typed my address wrong but the seller was easy to contact and make the switch. The book came very fast even after all of that!
2,over-rated,"These speakers just don't sound as good as everyone claims. They are base heavy and muddy, not crisp and clean. I regret having purchased them."
2,Powerful but Lacking,"They're better than any other PC Speakers I've ever heard, and are powerful enough to fill a small room. But that's about all the praise that I can give their sound, and it's not like PC speakers set a high bar.The sound out of these speakers is very disappointing considering their price and all the rave reviews they've gotten. The bass is extremely muddy and lacks anything that even resembles accuracy. Mids and highs are distorted to hell and back. There's no detail or clarity in any part of the spectrum. Music just doesn't sound...well...""musical"".I really can't recommend these speakers to anyone. For only 2/3rds of the price (or less) you can get a pair of cheap Polk Monitor 30's (or similar) bookshelf speakers and a vintage Marantz or Pioneer receiver/amp to drive them. No matter what sort of music you listen to, a setup like that outdoes these speakers by leaps and bounds, and for less money."
3,Over Rated,"Have had them for six months and found them to be deficient in mid range reproduction. Tried to increase mid frequencies thru an equalizer but still not much improvement. These speakers need a either a ""bass"" control to tone down the bass, or a ""treble"" control facility to boost them. Having none is arrogance and assumption that the makers know best.Bought a Logitech 623 2.1 system recently for PC streaming music output and found them MUCH better. Plus, at a third of the price they are a steal!!"
4,Speakers,"They sound is great when in use. But, they sometimes hum loudly when they are plugged in and not in use."
4,Amazing Sound in a Small Package,These speakers are small but quite heavy. I think that is because they are very well made and that is reflected in the very clear sound. These babies can really pack a punch. I use them for deck parties and can drive them either from my iPod are via Airplay with my Airport Express plugged into the handy power adapter on the back.Keep in mind that these are not super powerful but they will fill space like an apartment or a deck quite nicely and will give good sound provided you don't overcrank them.
1,"A5 muddy, boomy bass","A real surprise! After listening to these speakers for a few months, trying different sources, from my laptop to a CD player, they just do not live up to all the positive reviews. They just don't sound natural at all. The primary problem is BOOMY BASS which muddies the entire sound stage. My old cheap $50 BIC speakers sound better. And my Boston Acoustics home stereo speakers make the A5's sound like a cheap boom box. I DO like deep bass, but this is more like low-frequency feedback (around the range of 100 to 300 Hz?). The boom from bass guitar and the lower notes of acoustic guitar sound like almost constant feedback.UPDATE: I recently moved to a much larger space and now have the speakers positioned far from any wall, floor or ceiling and while it reduced some of the muddy, boomy bass, they still sound bad. Hence, I am reducing the rating from 2 stars to 1 star -- speaker placement is no longer a possible excuse for such bad sound."
5,The BEST Speakers made period for digital audio devices...,I bought these babies for my iPod and they are hands down the best speakers you can find for mp3 or any other digital audio device made. I bought a second pair for my Squeezebox and I'm amazed by the incredible audio quality that comes out of them! Highly recommended find!!!
4,"Ok, these are pretty remarkable after all","They need a decent break-in ... about 30 hours low-level volume, but then it seems to come together. Also, I used Herbie's Audio Dots to elevate off the desktop -- HUGE help. Whatever you do, don't just plunk them on your desktop -- way to much mechanical energy transmitted from these mini-beasts to whatever they happen to be sitting on, and the resulting odd resonances are not pretty!Bottom line, with the right material, situated in the right way, these suckers are remarkable."
3,Not going to work for low volume listening,"Although these are excellent speakers, my hope was to get high quality sound at low volumes in my office. Desktop speakers by design are only a few feet from the listener's ears. At low volumes the left (powered) speaker emits no sound. Turn it up a few notches and the left speaker kicks in but is still not balanced. One more notch or two levels the sound between the two speakers. Now it sounds great but is too loud for concentrating on work. I've got the right speaker as far away as I can, about 4 feet, but I can't move the left speaker farther away because I would not easily be able to adjust the volume without a remote. My source has no separate volume control.I've had them for four days so I've got time to see if the problem improves once the speakers get broken in. If not they may have to go back."
5,Worth Every Penny - Get the Sub,"I listen to music every day while I work. I'm not an audiophile, but the quality is still very important. First off, these speakers save tons of space. They're compact and don't require a receiver. And they can really crank. The sound quality is good but with the AS-8 subwoofer this system will really blow you away. It's tight, warm and full. In total, the system sounds absolutely amazing. And it's perfect for a small workspace."
1,I don't understand all the positive reviews!?,"These speakers are a great idea, unfortunately they dont follow through on expectations. Muddy, Dull, they distort, and the soundstage is among the worst ive ever heard! I took a loss and sold mine within a week of buying them. They are unique and cool but sound terrible!."
3,Tweeter on one speaker doesn't work,"Writing this review is bittersweet. The speakers look nice and have a quality feel to them. Unfortunately, the tweeter in the speaker without the amplifier doesn't work. Bummer.Despite the defective speaker, I have been listening to them for a couple hours. Even with the defective tweeter, they are comfortable to listen to and seem to image well. My everyday listening system includes a couple Vandersteen 2CEs, OCM power amp, Citation 7.0 prepro, Velodyne ULD18 and a decent Marantz CD transport. Not my audiophile system but a very good reference system. I don't like bright but love detail. These AE 5s sound good, I mean really good. [...].."
1,Terrible speakers,"The only people giving these speakers a good review are non-audiophiles. For $325, a pair of B&W; MM1's sound better (and they cost less too). AudioEngine A5 has terrible soundstage, overpowering bass and lousy, muddy mid and trebles. These speakers are so bad they should be illegal. I'm not kidding. In fact, if I were the FCC, I'd fine AudioEngine out of business, their products are luxury fraud.When I submitted the speakers back to AudioEngine, it took them over THREE WHOLE WEEKS to give me back my refund (at the start of the third week, I had to repeatedly call them for them to post the refund to my account directly).So even if the speakers were good, I wouldn't do business with AudioEngine again. Customer service was lousy too, they DO NOT know their products (a sound technician who doesn't know what audiophonics are? ARE YOU SERIOUS? You better be making minimum wage, Steve)."
5,Great sound,"These speakers sound very good. Lots of power and do not distort as long as you have a high quality source. There is not a ton of bass due to the size, so I highly recommend a subwoofer. I connected a 12"" Infinity sub to mine and it truely rocks. I am very critical of sound quality and belive that you get what you pay for. I have had these for 3 months and have nothing negative to say. The only advice, connect a sub."
3,"Pretty Good, But Not Outstanding","I was hoping to be blown away by these speakers and unfortunately I wasn't. But they still sound great, especially when played loud. Unfortunately I live in an apartment, so blasting these things full volume doesn't happen much. I wish they provided a fuller sound a low volume, but it's still serviceable. It's definitely an upgrade from my built-in TV speaks. If you are going to buy these for a modern TV make sure you get a digital to analog converter so that you can convert the optical audio signal from your tv to the analog input for the speakers. This should cost you about $70(You need to get a converter that decodes DOLBY, it's very easy to screw this up! so see the link below).http://www.amazon.com/Gefen-GTV-DD-2-AA-Digital-Audio-Decoder/dp/B0021QBIBQ/ref=pd_sim_e_3All that being said, I think they were worth the price."
5,Simply Pure Wisdom,"I've worked with this book for over a decade. It has acted as a trusted companion and has never let me down. No matter how many times your read it, and you'll want to read it many times, it is always fresh and new. The world would be a better place if more people read and practiced with this book."
3,On 7 Point Mind Training,"A little disconnected since it has been edited from talks given by Rinpoche, but helpful for study of the slogans from the 7 point mind training."
1,Definitely not the soundtrack,"This is one of the most disappointing cd's I have purchased! What a sham. I loved the music in the movie but oh, how Harry Connick ruined it.I totally agree with the reviews of your New York and L.A. customers. I only hope someday, they will release the original soundtrack."
2,Buyer beware! It's not really the movie soundtrack!,"I was very disappointed to receive this CD only to find out that the movie's original artists were replaced with Harry Connick Jr.'s interpretations of their music. Although I like Connick's music, it was the soundtrack I was after. Be a better shopper than I was, and be sure you're getting what you want."
2,False advertising,"For anybody who thinks they're buying the soundtrack of ""When Harry Met Sally,"" this CD is a disappointment. This is NOT the soundtrack of the movie, but rather a collection of remakes of the movie songs. Don't get me wrong, I love Harry Connick Jr, and this is a nice CD. But I love the original music of ""When Harry Met Sally,"" and I wish I could buy the actual movie soundtrack, which is what this is advertised to be."
1,This is NOT the soundtrack,"If you liked the music to the movie, you won't like this album unless you love Harry Connick. He sings his renditions of the songs instead of the artists you heard in the movie. Personally, I don't like him."
2,This is not the original soundtrack,"This collection of music by Harry Connick, whom I normally like very much, is NOT the music we heard in the motion picture. (...) I was very disappointed by this product and would not recommend this CD to anyone. Note that I'm not a Harry basher. I saw him live this summer at the Hollywood Bowl and he was fabulous. It's just a shame that this CD is borderline (...) presenting itself as the movie music (just look at the jacket). I cannot recommend this CD."
5,yes,"If you are looking for the sound track from the movie this isn't it, but it is just as good. Love ya Harry"
2,Where are the original?,"Harry Connick, Jr. did a fair job representing the musical legends that were found in the movie, but nonetheless, this soundtrack should contain the artists who created the songs and/or who were featured in the motion picture. If you are purchasing this CD because you enjoy the classics performed by musical legends, as I do, then I do not recommend this CD; instead I would buy the originals."
2,You're right... I know you're right.,"I understand that this is a ""music from"" disc, and not really a ""soundtrack"". But Harry Connick Jr. takes too many liberties on this production, IMNSHO. I was quite anxious to get this CD home and get it into the CD player. A purchase like this should stir memories from the film. I personally had a difficult time getting past the arrangements, which were - as noted in other reviews - so different from the film.If you're looking for the ""sound stylings of Harry Connick Jr"" this may well be a great album. As for me, don't mess with Mr Zero - and PLEASE don't mess with the music from my favorite film."
5,"Must say, this best jazz vocal cd ever heard","Cannot complain about cd, it is one of favorites, in entire collection. Love jazz, so when heard soundtrack at friends house, asked if Sinatra, said no Harry Connick Jr. Then went to store bount immidiately. Never have stopped playing since, one of favorites. Connick have smokey voice, and great Thelonios Monk meeets swing style of piano playing. Connick has big band with unique arrangements, very swing but as same time very jazz. Ah so!!! Great cd!!!"
2,When Harry Met Sally: Music from the Motion Picture,"I loved the music in this movie, but the soundtrack just doesn't seem like the same music of versions of the music. I only listened to it once."
2,When Harry Met Sally movie soundtrack,This CD is NOT the music soundtrack from the movie. It's only some of the music that is in the movie. I was very disappointed. I wanted the original soundtrack of the music you hear when you watch the movie. That's why I purchased it. Is the original soundtrack NOT available or was it not produced? I wouldn't buy this CD again.
1,Marketing Bull - Not the Soundtrack!!,"I can't understand how they can compile a fantastic ""soundtrack"" with Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra,...etc and then market this ""intepretation"" by Harry Connick Jr. Don't get me wrong the guy is talented and I do enjoy some of his music, but I wanted the original SOUNDTRACK!! I was dissappointed."
4,Great interpretations by Mr. Connick,"It has been so long since I saw this movie-I didn't realize that Connick did not actually perform the songs in the movie. No matter, this is still a very enjoyable cd for a nice sunny afternoon or a cold chilly winter night with your sweetie. Fun stuff. Recommended."
5,made me a harry connick fan,i bought this cassette shortly after watching When Harry Met Sally in the theater over 20 years ago and although it does not feature the original music of the movie it exposed me to the musical talents of harry connick jr and since then i have listened and purchased much of the music he has since made. i have since purchased it in CD format and it has been ripped into mp3 format and today is part of my permanent road trip playlist.
2,Songs deserved better,Classic songs deserved better interpretation. Connick not quite in tune and definitely not Sinatra like in phrasing or presentation.
4,Duke Does It Again,"This album (CD) is an eclectic mixture from Ole School Funk, like Ain't It Funky Now and Creepin' to acid-funk jazz with songs like Another Way To Look At It to straight acid-jazz with Ten Miles Jog.Duke begins with a hip live performance of The Black Messiah (Part II). My personal favorites are the mesmerizing sounds of Chillin' and Let's Roll (Dukes tribute to 9/11). These transcendental songs remind me of ""Look What We Started"" from Illusions and ""Sunrise"" from the Snapshot CD's - spellbinding.The accompaniment of Christian McBride on acoustic bass and John Roberts and Lenny Castro on percussions add an incredibly hypnotic dimension to Dukes non-accoustic raptures.There's a little bit of something on this album (CD) for everyone."
5,"Face the Music, indeed!","Face the Music is a George Duke mosaic that expresses the many diverse facets of a great artist's soul! There's soul, there's jazz, there's latin, there's blues and even a touch of the old Zappa in this chapter. George is one of the GREAT jazz/fusion keyboardists whose performance is solidly supported by Chris McBride and Little John Roberts who build a pocket SO deep their keencaps are surely scratched raw. Every track is different and interesting, something for EVERYONE! This is truly great music! Excuse me, I gotta go listen to it AGAIN!"
4,The Black Messiah,"The album is fabulous, especially the first four tracks. The music is relaxing whilst extremely melodic. It is definitely Goerge Duke at his best."
3,Pretty funny but...,"I am a Jew-by-Choice (by-marriage) I found this book Hilarious, but my husband who is ""ethnically"" jewish found it bordering on racial slurs. Perhaps he hit too close to home... When he when to a cousin's bar mitzvah last week, he wore his tallit like a scarf! He didn't know how to put on one even though our reform rabbi wears one to every service! So, I get my loving nickname back: shiksa because I actually laughed at this book! OY! Like many jews he really doesn't know what the Yiddish word shiksa translates as..."
3,Its ok,Average all around book on Declarer play. Low intermediates wont appreciate the finer points.Its a reasonable book.
5,Most favorite tea,"Discovered in the local Bob Evans restaurants, quickly became the favorite tea. It could not be found on any of the local stores shelves so we turned to Amazon to find it. Very happy with the quality of the product."
1,Bad new recipe,"Like the other subscriber below, I too have canceled my subscription for Twinings Earl Grey tea, which I used to drink religiously every morning. Evidently there's been a change in recipe (google it) in effect since 2006. The tea is not just weaker, it's just plain BAD. Twinings has denied the change but evidently certain tea drinkers are in an uproar."
2,Very weak,I will be canceling my order as the taste is far too weak. I use two teabags per cup and the taste is just missing!?
4,Good value--weak tea,"I ordered this product because of the value and that it is sometimes a challenge to find Twinings decaf tea. However, if you like the traditional (stronger) Earl Grey tea, be aware that this tea is the ""lite"" version. It states right on the box that it is a milder version and not as strong. (I don't think this is noted on the web description.) I just let it brew a little longer, but it is still not as strong as the original version. So if you like strong tea, I would not order this (at least in the decaf version)."
5,Perfect tool for understanding astrology,"If you have any experience or knowledge with mythology, the perfect starting place for astrology is this book.Though it is OOP you may find a used copy running around, and I would advise grabbing it up.The authors explain the mythological parallels of each sign and planet and off a unique manner for interpretting astrological placements based upon each sign.Astrology didn't begin with mythology but the names given to planetary bodies did. And their relevancy to modern astrology is key in education."
3,It was good,"I enjoyed the stories. They didn't keep me on the edge of my seat, but they were good nonetheless. I would recommend it though."
5,I love Miss Sook and Buddy!,"I do love these people. I had a Miss Sook too and she taught me to be kind. I gave this book to my new daughter-in-law who really does like to bake and eat fruitcake, and does not use them for doorstops.Miss Sook and Buddy are very real to me. I am tired of what goes for good writing these days. I gratefully pick up Mr. Capote's books when I need to read lovely words. I sit down, turn off the phone, and have some PEACE as I read these stories. Raise a glass to Miss Sook and Truman Capote, wherever they may be, and they are somewhere good. You have to be somewhere, you can't be nowhere. Cheers."
3,Forgettable,I know I read this book but I don't remember what it contained. it was an acceptable way to spend some time over Christmas.
5,"A Christmas Memory, One Christmas, & The Thanksgiving Visitor","I read the story, A Christmas Memory for the first time in Jr. High School some twenty-five years ago. A few weeks ago, some friends and I were talking about great short stories and Truman Capote's name to the forfront of my mind as I remembered this sad little story . Reading it again, I felt akin to Mr. Capote, being brought back to a time in my own life that was alittle slower and more innocent. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read..."
5,"what's all the fuzz, intrigue & mistery about this album?","this is a beautiful example of a chic productions album , it has added the guitar of chris stein , so what? is as disco as the other chic albums & very well produced & played. after all harry, made some other disco songs , or not? what are heart of glass, the tide is high, call me, with their respective 12"" dance versions & the shorter rapture? it all sounds disco to me. besides, the lyrics in this album are hilarious, is so funny. is a very very good album. i like it more now than when i first got it on plastic 32 yrs ago"
5,Chic-sized Debbie at her peak & at her best,"This is actually a very good album from 1981 during the big Blondie heyday. While it did not have any major hits; it placed respectably on the top 40 chart & has the red-hot Chic gang (Nile Rodgers, Bernard Edwards, Tony Thompson & Fonzi Thornton) working with her as musicians & producers.Debbie does some great vocals here; the beats are raw & funky; a little rocky at times, a little wild at times (Military Rap), a little slow at times (Now I Know You're Mine ... one of the best), disco-ish (Backfired) , etc. There really is something here for all fans of Blondie & Debbie alike. Check out Oasis ... an awesome song.Debbie was at a peak here (again in 1999), the results are fab. This is quite an enjoyable album. Grab it!"
1,Bizzare misstep for Blondie vocalist,"Don't let the enthusiastic reviews from other Debbie fans sway you, this album is a complete misfire. Ms. Harry moves from disco to rap to jazz without succeeding in either genre. ""Backfired"" the first single sounded ten years out of date even in 1981 when this solo album was released. Despite dozens of listens by this huge Blondie fan, I cannot make myself admire any of the songs on this mishmash."
2,Even Debbie Harry wasn't immune to making bad music,"As a big Blondie fan, I was eager to hear some of Debbie's solo stuff. It doesn't measure up. Some people say that ""Koo Koo"" is one of the worst albums ever made. I wouldn't go that far, but it is not a CD I would recommend to my friends. There are a few good tracks scattered throughout (""Oasis"" is a good song), but for the most part it is a second rate, bastardized version of Blondie. Even if it had the Blondie name, it wouldn't have been one of their highly regarded albums. Debbie Harry is a great and dynamic singer, so the lackluster quality of this album was a suprise.But one thing I can say, the album cover is great."
5,Classic Debbie,"In Debbie's first solo outing, she sheds the punk side of her for the funk side! In choosing the Chic Orginization (Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards of ""Le Freak"" fame) for production, Debbie shows a knack for starting trends (Rodgers and Edwards would soon produce for Madonna and Duran Duran). Though many a critic have denounced Debbie's singing ability, I can't see how they can overlook the stunning beauty of her voice on songs like ""Now I Know You Know"" and it's R&B flavor on ""Backfired"". Once again, listen to me- not the hacks passing themselves off as critics! This album's sexy playfulness sounds just as good against a Toni Braxton album, but was done well before Ms. Braxton's time! Debbie truly is a trend setter and this album proves it!"
1,"Dreary, With a Backdrop","When I saw Simon Rattle on the Charlie Rose show this evening, I thought of this concert which I saw on TV a few years ago. Rattle said to Rose, ""Conducting is one of the biggest fake professions"". Of course Rose, when speaking of anything but politics, cannot be bothered to even stay conscious. So he didn't inquire further what the conductor meant by this very strange assertion. In jest was certainly the truth. I thought of this concert and the vapid, dreary and pretentious performances given in it. A monumental, nay even epochal waste of talents, made even more cloying by the superb classical setting as backdrop. No wonder classical music means so little to so many, when the most famous representatives are so uninterested that, de facto, they might as well be faking it."
4,The book gives an excellent review of current aircraft,"Great Aircraft of the World is an excellent review of current and past aircraft. The book details aircraft designers, years of service, primary purpose and many other facinating details about the aircraft. Although it was published in 1993 the volume is very current with current technologies. Great Aircraft combines excellent pictorial, photographs, and greatly detailed information about each aircraft. Thus it is not just a pretty photo essay. I strongly suggest this volume for those interested in a concise overall volume on aircraft"
1,A disappointing read,"I did not like this book. Most of the cases are well documented elsewhere and nothing of interest was added. The premise that you can ""think"" the UFO's into showing themselves is silly. If your looking for a serious book on the UFO phenomena look elsewhere."
5,"One of the few, good UFO books in print","Why aren't Donald Menzel's books still in print today? What a shame...There are hundreds of books for believers, but very few with actual facts. ""The UFO Invasion"" has the facts.The only coverup is by the believers... who twist information to fit their preconcieved ideas.Trust me, you'll learn the truth by reading the works of Klass, Sheaffer, Korff, and Donald Menzel."
1,Im sorry--,THE VOCALS- HORRIBLE- SOUNDS LIKE THE GUYS FROM SOUTH PARK- NO JOKE- (EXAMPLE- THE TITLE TRACH FROM ORGASMO) Good Keys- but the Vocals are A JOKE
1,Sucks,"This album sucks and is no way like what PTW normally is. Heavy? Yeah, I don't think so. Go back to your roots Poison the Well. This album is terrible."
4,Not bad.,"There are some good songs on this CD, but it's not the best PTW CD, in my opinion (that title goes to You Come Before You). This is still a CD worth having if you are a PTW fan, I think."
4,"It's not ""you come before you"" but great in it's own way","A big change that really differentiates poison the well from almost every other leading hard core band. It's totally rockin in a grand ball room old western kind of way, listen to it and you'll see what I mean. the slide work on the guitar is awesome and a fresh approach to heavy music."
5,Awesome,"First off, just get this album.Then listen, and enjoy.You'll then notice that the more you listen, the better it gets. If you're liking parts, after a few listens you'll probably be enjoying the entire album. Eventually you'll realize just how incredible this album is. Then later on, a radio is turned on, you wince, and long for this CD or something of similar high caliber.In summary, this is not a business venture, but rather it's innovation and originality. It is music."
3,Uhhh... Jandek... uhhh...,"It's hard to review Jandek. He doesn't have any real songs. From the sounds of it, it is Thurston Moore mumbling over a warped guitar plonk with some banging and percussion and harmonica. The cover shows a picture of a drum kit. The song titles are ""New Town"" (strangely, this song has snatches of Leonard Cohen's ""Suzanne"" in it), ""Steal Away Home"", ""Street Walk"", ""You Standing There"", ""Desert Voice"", ""Let Me Hear THe Words You Say"", ""The Real You"", ""It WOuld ONly Be Action"", ""Look At It"", ""Time WIll Come"" and ""What You Are."" It sounds almost like traditional Japanese music - you know, the kind where a woman will pluck at a zither with a big wedge-shaped shingle and howl about something that you can't understand. That's what listening to Jandek is like. And it's wonderful."
3,Classic Resource - Hard to Approach,"Annie Besant wrote this book on the Theosophic septinary principles back in the early part of the 20th Century. The 7 principles of man are foundational for anyone attempting to understand theosophical thought. Besant takes the reader through a brief discussion of the Physical Body, The Etheric Body, The Prana, The Kama, The Manas, The Buddhi and the Atma. Unfortunately the style of writing and the approach is nearly 100 years old and it shows. If you are looking to get a good foundational understanding of theosophical thought, read one of the more modern works by the Theosophical Publishing House. This is a good book for a collection, or a hard core theosophist - but is too basic for an advanced student and to hard to approach for the beginner to be of great use execpt as a complementary expose on the history of the movement."
5,Great Gift,I gave this lamp as a graduation gift. My brother loved it. Great construction and it lights up perfectly. It looks even better in person than in the picture.
5,real karate,"Fighting Black Kings was the first video I've seen on full contact traditional karate. The film follows the training regimen of fighters from all over the world as they prepare for the prestigious all-world full contact karate tournament in Japan. The film cuts nicely from when the fighters are are on the fighting mat in the tournament to showing them back home training in their respective contries. Although the tournament is open to all styles, the rules favor the kyokushinkai system.The only reason the film is called ""Fighting Black Kings"" is because it focused on a number of prominent black karateka from New York such as Willie Williams and William Oliver who were preparing to compete in the All-World. They trained in the Kyokushinkai system which is known for it's emphasis on full-contact kumite with no pads or gloves. The fighters are interviewed and offer their perspectives on fighting in the All-World Tournament."
5,Karate the way it should be,"This is a excellent documentary, the men in this video are real Martial Artists, no fancy uniforms, no glitz or glamour,no foam dipped pads,no tag kumite matches, just real blood,sweat,and tears,This is the way Karate should have stayed,it is good to see that this style is still alive with the art of Kyokushin which is what style the film is based on.I for one always look back to this video for inspiration as I'am now a Kyokushin Karateka and Karateka for the past 19 years in Wado Kai Karate as a 3rd dan. Its too bad alot forgot about what Karate was all about and its nice to see this video still around to show others how it should be.This video also has a funky soundtrack as it was made in 1976. a Real Feel Good Video."
4,Put this on DVD SUCKAS!,"Get this on DVD asap while everyone is going wild for Black Dynamite. We want more true 70's style pimptastic kung fu, karate and karazy!"
4,nice design,It looks really nice and I love the design. A nice deal for the price but only really meant to be used as a display piece.
5,"beautifully written, comprehensive natural history of Hudson River environment","An insider's view of an historic battle to save one of the world's great rivers, passionately written by a man who was instrumental in launching it. Boyle, a journalist and sportsman, has an extraordinary grasp of the larger issues involved, and a naturalist's attention to detail. You will learn more about this surprising tidal estuary than you imagined wanting to know -- and enjoyably too. If you find the detailed sections on marine life too much -- just skim them and continue. It's more than worth your while."
5,Great sounding system,"If there is one movie that you watch on this system - it was to be War of the Worlds. The sound is crisp and the bass really sucks you into the movie.Aesthetically, it's very pleasing. The towers site nicely, flanking my TV. I just have to find the time now to pull wire through my house so that I can mount the smaller satellite speakers to the back wall. I think it'll be worth the time though.There were a couple of other similar systems that I looked at (Sony and Panasonic) and this one really had the best bang for the buck."
4,"Works fine, a bit bulky and inconvenient","I bought this cable to connect another computer to a 4-port KVM. It seems to be solidly built and works fine with a 19 inch LCD monitor at 1280 by 1024 resolution. However, the cable is bulkier than the ones I already had, so it sticks out a bit further behind the computer. Also, the other cables have longer end segments for the keyboard and mouse, which are also lighter than the video segment. This means that the weight of those cables is taken by the DB15 connector which has retaining screws. Unfortunately, the weight of the new Cables To GO cable is being taken by the PS2 connectors, which don't have retaining screws. Time will tell whether this causes problems or not, but this cable does seem to be a less satisfactory design."
2,Seller description is poor,"I bought this volume of a very interesting work by Robert Southey that I highly recommend, but I do not recommend this edition. It is a facsimile edition, which is fine, but the generic description provided by the seller is completely useless and misleading. When I received the book, I quickly realized that this is volume VII, a fact that is entirely absent from the description. I will be returning this volume, and will not be purchasing more works from this press, since it is impossible to actually see what you will receive."
5,Classic Must Have For Knitters,I had this book many years ago and lost it during a move. I am so glad it has been reprinted and made available again. Barbara Walker's books are classic and a must have for knitters of all experience levels. Nowhere else will you find such a variety of knitting patterns contained in one book.
5,Thorough and well written,This and the first Treasury of Knitting are my go-to resources for for knit stitch patterns. There are patterns for every skill level.
4,Good but not big enough,"The bag was nice and as described except it was way too small for my 5/8"" thick yoga mat. The description should have included a note that it only fits 1/8"" or 1/4"" yoga mats and is not suitable for thicker mats."
4,Somewhat better than average,"The JBuds are an economic choice with reasonable performance. Their main weakness is overall frequency response which seems weak in higher frequencies. The ear buds are advertised as ""noise-reducing"", chiefly because the interchangeable caps are designed to fill the ear canal and block external sounds. The JBuds are nominally effective at this goal. Also, it took several days to get used to the feeling, because they rest in the ear canal, not on the outside. Incidentally, I have a Samsung MP3 player (which I love). The Samsung ear buds that came with the device were superior to the JBuds. In summary the JBuds are fairly good, especially considering the price."
2,Eh..,"I was hoping for earphones with a snug fit. The sound from these things is actually pretty good, but that's only if you can keep them in your ear. Even with the different attachments I find they tend to fall out. The wire is thin and cheap so it gets caught on my arm, not to mention the damn thing pops out of the Ipod headphone jack constantly. They do reduce noise and have decent sound to them, though."
3,Too flimsy,"The sound quality was great, but I got this for working out. My gym plays too high of a volume in music, so I wanted noise-reduction ear phones, but the nubs that reduce sounds were too flimsy. Most of the time they slipped out of ears. I didn't know if I could returm them (passing my ear wax scum to others didn't interest me), so I gave them to my son who makes adequate usage of them, never mind ear wax. I ended up buying a Phillips noise reducing ear phones instead and they are equal to the sound quality of theses but the nubs are firmer and block out the noise while I work out at my gym. Nice."
3,"Less sound quality, more comfort","These earphones are comfortable but the quality of the sound is not as good as my original ipod headphones. Also, it needs more length where the cord splits to left and right sides."
3,Not great for exercising,"I think the sound quality of these headphones is fine. I'm having a hard time keeping them in my ears, which means they are no good to me while I'm exercising. They would probably be fine if I was using them while sitting at a desk, on a subway, or on a plane."
5,Good quality - Great customer support,"These are good quality ear buds for a great price, and the customer service is outstanding. I have used many different ear buds and for some reason one side will always go out after a few months. This same thing happened with these J-buds but when I contacted them about the warranty on it they immediately shipped me a new set free of charge.I would highly recommend these, fine quality for a great price."
3,Works good,"These did what they were designed to do, and did it fine. They were purchased as a back up for the player I bought, but I found that the ones that came with it worked very well. Still, no complaints about these either."
3,Review,"If you move the insertion plug around, you lose audio so be careful (especially in pockets). Apart from that, it's really good."
5,"Great fit, durable construction, fantastic value!","I bought a pair of JBuds for my husband, who has small ear canals and has trouble finding earbuds that are comfortable and won't fall out. The JBuds are a perfect fit, very comfortable, and have a good sound quality for the price (they're not Bose, but what do you want for 10 bucks?) He uses them all the time, especially at the gym, and enjoys the fact that they don't fall out easily. I have to give a huge thumbs-up for the durability of this product, also... He's left them in his pants pockets several times, and I've unwittingly washed and dried them. And they still work perfectly! I'm so impressed with these earbuds that I'm now ordering a pair for myself, too. :)"
4,Nice set for the price,I purchased the Jbuds after reading reviews online at Amazon and seeing the price below $20. I figured for that price how could I go wrong... right? Well Right! They are not noice reducing but a nice pair of headphones. They are not an audiophiles dream but they are as close as you are ever going to get for $20. I say worth the price and they arrive very quickly. Great job!
2,"Just OK, mediocre","These are just OK ear buds. They don't sound really great. The sound is somewhat mushy because the rubber is soft and doesn't form a very tight seal. The soft rubber means that they are comfortable to wear, but the trade off is that the sound isn't as good as ear buds that make a tighter seal in your ear. Tighter ear buds sound better but they are less comfortable. Also, these do not block out external sound very well. Overall if I could do it over, I would not have bought them. I would've just kept using the buds that came with my Zune."
4,"Surprisingly effective, does not fit iPod nano perfectly","The JBuds definitely work as advertised. I used to listen to my iPod at 75% volume level on average, but now the volume level is more like 25-30%! I was surprised how well they cut out the sound, but there are some drawbacks.1. They do not perfectly fit my iPod 1st generation nano. The headphone jack wiggles a bit, so occasionally I only get sound through one ear bud. This hasn't happened much, but they don't seem to fit as well as the iPod ear buds.2. The ear buds also don't fit my ear that well. Either the covers are too small or too big. They should fit snugly to get the most out of sound cancellation.In any case, for what I paid, I am quite glad with the investment. My ears thank me too. ;)"
1,horrible sound,"I bought these ear phones since my last ear phones, Apple M9394G/B iPod In-Ear Headphones, broke after mishandling them. I was looking for a cheap alternative since my former apple ear buds were $40. What a mistake going to these cheapo ear jbuds. The sound quality is horrible. For those of you that know what bit rate is, these $20 jbuds (j for junk) make your beautiful radio quality 192 KB MP3 sound like a 64KB MP3. No exageration here. Say you are listening to an orchestra - 1/2 of the instruments disappear when using the jbuds and if there any vocals, they are noticeably dulled. Don't buy these ear phones if you appreciate quality."
2,Junk,"Was looking for a replacement to my Sony's.These don't at all compare in terms of both sound quality or build quality.These are very flimsy and poor quality, and sound like trash.The two buds are widened by simply prying apart the two wires. There is no adjustment or securing mechanism.I returned these.Worth coughing up the dough for some quality."
3,The just okay earbuds,"I lost my earbuds, so I needed a cheap replacement pair until I buy a more expensive pair. I hate to say, but they were what I expected, I read some reviews and knew they wouldn't be amazing, but they are good for what they are. :)"
5,Great,Great ear buds...I use them in bed and usually fall asleep and they are in all night and are very comfortable...
4,Good little buds,"I haven't really listened to music on these earbuds, but I have been listening to a lot of lectures and these work great. It does reduce some noise, but I'm usually using them in a library, so there is not much noise for them to reduce. These work great for what I use them for."
1,Cheap Earbuds,"Have been buying this exact Ear bud for years, and recently bought these and I could tell that they are made cheaper now. The cord is thinner and cheaper, than my other ear buds that I received from them. And to make matters worse, one of the ear buds, I can't hear any sound from it, after using it for a month."
1,Good for the 3 seconds it lasted,"Seeing as there were many good reviews I decided to get these new Jbuds. These headphones were great the first time I used them. Then after I would say after one wear the second time around the earphones started cutting in and out. Volume would cut in half with low treble and no bass, then if moved a certain way the sound would come back for one to two seconds. Now they are essentially unusable. I kept them in their case and took care of them but now they are useless to me. I wouldn't recommend these headphones, as I was only able to get one good use out of them until they became faulty. It's like buying a new CD but only be able to listen to it once, not great at all."
4,Good ear buds for the money,"I purchased these ear buds to replace the ones that came with my Ipod nano. I only have to raise the volume half way to really crank up the music compared to all the way with the other ones. Rubber plugs block out a lot of background especially on buses. My only complaints are the wires being too long, especially when exercising on the elliptical rider, and the buds hurting my ears after prolong use. Other than that and excellent buy and good upgrade from the standard issue buds."
2,Professional Musician Review,"I bought these as a replacement for my earbuds that came with my iPod. The arrived quickly but once they arrived I realized that they were not what they appeared to be.I realize that for 20 dollars I am not getting ultra high quality earbuds, however, I was shocked and how poor the quality of these was. The sound of the buds is extremely small and treble based. There is absolutely no bottom end present. It felt like I was listening to my car radio in my 1983 Chevette again.Finally, I want to let anyone out there know, that this is not just an angry review. Yes, I lost 20 bucks, but much worse is that these are not even worth using if you are interested in listening to music. For podcasts they are fine, but please be warned if you plan to use these for music, you will not be hearing much of the lower frequencies.I hope this review has been helpful."
3,Mixed feelings,"At first I wasn't sure how I liked these headphones; they were pretty uncomfortable because I was used to ear buds that do not go all the way in your ears, so I couldn't wear these for long periods of time. After a little while though, I got used to that and they were fine. I liked the fact that they blocked other noise (not completely, but enough) and that they didn't fall out when I wore them to sleep (or when I eat). However, a few weeks after I got them, the right ear bud broke. The part round part with the speaker in it separated from the part that goes in the ear. It still plays sound and sounds the same way, but I kept having to put it back together. Then I put some scotch tape on it, not expecting it to keep it together, but it has worked so far. It doesn't look the prettiest, but it is functional."
5,Comfort at last!,The earbuds sound good and actually fit my ears comfortably. I only wish some company would offer replacement covers since these will eventually wear out. I may just buy a cheap set and use those covers. These earbuds don't completely block noise but for me that is a good thing since I do need to be in some contact with my environment for safety reasons. I use them with my new Nano and am completely pleased with my purchase.
4,Earbuds,"These are not bad, I had a couple of instances where they had a bit of static, I adjusted the plug-in, and it stopped. Overall, they've been good. They don't stay in the ear well enough for cycling, but they are fine for running and general use."
3,It Works. But not a set of buds for keeps.,The audio quality is par. It noise reduces by sticking the buds into your ears and cranking the volume. It's not flexible at the input joint. The headphones broke on me in under 6 months of regular usage. I do not recommend.I am sporting Sennheisers PX 100s after that purchase. I'm satisfied. Please look at those.
3,"Good buy, but not great headphones","First thing I noticed about these headphones is that they're not very nice-looking. The male end of the cord is bend rather than straight like the Apple earbuds that come with the iPod, and it just looks awkward. Also, there is no permanent joint in the wire, and when you first get them you have to rip the cords apart yourself and hope they don't rip any more. All that wouldn't be so bad if not for what I think is the biggest problem--they're about a full foot too long. I'm tall, and the cord still dangles almost to my knees when I've got them on, and unless I wrap it up or shove it in my pocket, it catches on everything (door handles, chair arms, EVERYTHING) and rips them out of my ears.Sound is pretty good, but I'm not very discerning about that. They do block outside noise very well and have good bass. They also come with three sizes in case your ears are small or large."
4,Good inexpensive ear buds,Sound is fine for my old ears. Choice of 3 size ear inserts let me get a good fit so they don't keep falling out like the standard iPod headphones.
3,just ear buds,"plug em in mp3 player, put other end in ear, hear music, nothing fancy, cheaply made, sound quality mediocre, price ok"
2,Had product for 3 days and the cord is already broke,"I ordered this item last week and just started using them on Monday. The sound is fine, comfort level is perfectly fine but there is a rip in the cord and one of the ears is already breaking up and cutting out."
4,Noise-Reducing indeed !,"The earbuds are good enough and definitely noise reducing. The sound quality is good with good bass effects (which I couldn't find in many earbuds I used). Go ahead and try them, its a good deal here at amazon too !"
2,Meh,These were prey good while they for a while but the left ear bud stopped working after 4 months. You get what you pay for.
1,BAD!,I bought one pair of these and it worked great. great sound and they look simple. After about 6 months of usage i bought another 7 pairs.... because i wanted them everywhere i went. 7 months in... all of them have had one earbud failure. wtf!
5,Great Product,"I love these buds, I can hear new instruments I didn't hear before after listening to the same music for 30 years. For the money I honestly don't think you'll find a better product, its just amazing an average type of music lover like me. I don't think the average person will have a problem with these buds, they are excellent"
4,Pretty Good Ear Buds,"These ear buds were a good price and they reduced the noise well. It came with different sizes of rubber ends to the buds, which makes it easier for me. (If those are too big they suction cup your ears and it really hurts, so I was glad for a smaller option.) The sound is good, and I love having these in my car because my mom always plays her music way too loud and with these I can listen to mine too. The only downside is more of a personal issue for me and it is that my ears are different in size and I can't get both buds to fit the same way. Otherwise it is definitely an excellent buy! Way better than the skull candy's I used to have!"
1,Not a good buy,"I've owned many headphones over the years. The last pair I had came with my ipod and I used them for about 4 years until they broke. I didn't want to spend $30 on a pair of headphones right now (which is what the Apple ones cost), so I bought these instead. The reviews were good enough and it was reduced from $49.95 to $9.95. While the sound quality is pretty good (better than the apple), they are extremely uncomfortable! You have to push them all the way inside your ear for them to hold on, which hurts after awhile. And the right earbud doesn't fit very well in my ear and keeps popping out, so I have to push it harder and harder, which hurts even more. It is very frustrating. I will give these away to someone who wants them and buy some other brand. I recommend that you TRY THEM ON FIRST so see if they fit your ear and if they are comfortable, before you buy them."
2,Radio option sucks!,"Works pretty good as MP3, but radio reception sucks. Can't pick station in any location and I live in the city."
5,Great buds,Very comfortable! Not the best for noise reduction compared to say bose buds but for the price the quality is excellent.
1,Worst ear buds EVER,"I just bought them , they look like decent quality in the pictures but right when i opened the box I knew these where garbage.. They sound like crap !DO NOT BUY THEM .. ! THEY SUCK !"
4,Good as a back-up set.,"I got these as a back-up set for my Sansa Clip Plus mp3 player. The buds that came with the player actually sound noticeably better than these JBuds do, but they do block out more noise. I'll use them when I expect to be somewhere noisy. For less then $10 I'm still happy with the purchase, and am glad to have something in case my other ear buds get damaged or lost. Shipping was really speedy, and this is a good deal for the price."
4,These JBuds ear buds just plain works.,"These JBuds ear buds does not cancel noise, but does reduce them due to their firm fit while wearing. The music quality is good--clear highs, and suprisingly, you can hear the bass. I would buy another set of these if the ones I have now stops working."
2,Not Worth it,"Bought this headphone in July, initially it hurt my ears for first few days even on low volume. Worked fine for few months and then the right side stopped working and now the left side also is shaky. None of my earlier headphones faded out so fast. If you are looking for really low price one then go for it but its durability isn't good."
1,Depends what you want them for.,"Pros:- Decent sound quality (on par or slightly better than standard ipod earbuds)- Decent noise blocking (better than standard ipod earbuds)- PriceCons:- Will not stay in my ear when running. My old ipod earbuds would fall out maybe once or twice on a 5 mi run. These fall out about every 30 seconds. I bought these for running, thats why I gave the 1 star.Note, I also used them on a plane the other day. There they slipped out slightly but never fell all the way out."
1,If you like quality sound.. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!,"The sound quality is terrible. Everything sounds muffled like you're listening to a cheap cassette tape through a carboard tube. It comes with LARGE, MEDIUM, and SMALL ear buds.. too bad none of them secure the buds into your ear. I literally turn my head, and they fall out. They fit as well as a size 12 on Eva Mendez. This product is terrible, don't even consider it."
2,Cheaper options are just as good.,"I had to return the product because one bud was noticeably louder than the other. Ignoring this problem, the sound was just okay and there was no real noise reduction. The black rubber that goes in your ear is thin and hollow, so it does nothing to block outside noise. There are other options such as a colby on amazon for around $5 that would be just as good for a third of the price."
2,Broke sooner than I would have liked,"Months after I purchased the Ear Buds, I was quite happy with them...until they broke. With the light wear and tear associated with a college student, the right ear bud broke in about 3 months. My Apple ear buds lasted for two years so I was hoping to get a similar length out of these. Alas, my ears are doomed."
2,"Well, I got what I paid for.","I bought two pairs of these ear buds just over a year ago for less than $10 each, one to leave at work and one to carry around with my Zune. They were excellent as far as comfort and sound goes, no complaints there at all. However, the right bud on one set died about a month after I got them, and then the right bud on the second set also died a few months later. That second set completely died last week so now I am down to the first pair with only one bud working. I thought about getting some more since the price is even lower now, but why would I want to buy something I know I am just going to replace again in another year or so? Instead I opted to spend a bit more for a better product.If you're looking for what would be essentially disposable ear buds, then this is for you. If you want something that's going to be long-lasting, I do not recommend this product."
1,Terrible,"if you take ""hi-fi noise-reducing"" out of the title of these, then you have a pretty accurate description of what these are really like. Terrible."
3,It broke,The left side stop working after some months. I guess you get what you paid for. Noise cancelling was ok.
2,easily broken; not very durable,These fit quite comfortably until the day they broke ridiculously easily. I really kind of think we all might prefer ear buds which cannot be literally yanked apart by lightly pulling on one of the wires.
3,"Good value, but breaks easily.","I like these earbuds for their value and audio quality, but the way its made it rather shoddy. As time goes by, the plastic that covers the wire near the bottom of the ear buds will slowly begin to ""shrink"" (imagine a can being crushed, the length decreases) and expose the wiring. If you firmly pull the entire length of the wire though, as if smoothing a rumpled cloth, you can push the cover back into place and recover the wire with a bit of effort. As a result, one or both earbuds may fail in about a few months. My pair lasted about 3 to 4 months.On the other side, my sister's earbuds of the same purchase was extremely poor. Within a week of usage, the part where you plug into devices broke off. Be careful where you buy your products!"
2,Unsettling Feeling,"There's no great mystery as to how these work ... They reduce ambient noise by plugging up your ears with rubber. Personally, they made me feel like I had a bad cold -- unpleasant enough that I used them only twice before switching to a set of full over-the-ear headphones."
3,Solid product,JBuds provide a more tailored fit with three sizes of silicone buds. There is noticeable noise reduction and good sound quality. These little work horses deliver good performance for their price.
3,A little over stated,"The fit on these units is pretty good. However, if you think they are really a noise canceling ear bud, well.... I have some ocean front property in AZ. $20 won't do it. I bought them thinking there was a remote chance they'd provide some ambient noise reduction. They don't. My iPod nano buds have better range."
3,Great Quality--A little hard to use.,The sound in these are great. The only problem my wife and I have (we bought 2) is that they are hard to keep in your ears. If you are just wearing then around while walking they are perfect...but once you start to jog or stretch or run...they fall out. I have tried all the different size earbuds that came with it but with no luck.
3,lasted just over 3 months,Used daily.Lasted from beginning of December to beginning of march.Sound is decent in comparison to my old Sony's which lasted over a year. But i payed double for the Sony's (about $25).One earphone quit working.
3,No sing along,"The noise reduction works well and the sound quality is fine. However, these headphones are terrible if you like to sing along to your music! See, they're tight enough that you only hear your voice through your head and not your ears. It sounds pretty weird!"
2,Very disappointing -- You get what you pay for,"These looks great and price is right, but the sound quality is quite poor. Very tight midrange of frequencies -- NO bass or treble, though. It's like listening to loud music coming from the house next door. Not good."
3,"OK, but not what I needed","I guess I have a small ear canal, because my iPod earphones keep slipping out and even if they stay in, they are not deep enough for me to hear the music well. So I bought these Jbuds since they have the various size ear pieces and were rated highly and weren't that expensive. I've used them once. No matter which ear piece I use, they still won't stay in my ears and the sound isn't great out of them anyway. Instead, I've found that by turning my Ipod earbuds sideways and putting them in that way, they stay in well and provide great sound."
3,Poor sounding,"The sound from this earphones lacks bass and richness. If you value sound quality, spending extra money to get better sounding earphones is worthwhile."
4,Good Value,Very good at this price. More comfortable than many expensive ear buds I've used and not unpleasant to listen to. I bought a second pair.
2,"I guess for $10 you can't complain too much, but...","For the money i guess it's a fair buy, but to those who demand a little more for their money, the JVC marshmallow work and sound so much better. I bought these in hopes of replacing the marshmallows but i was highly disappointed. I tested these and the marshmallows side by side via auxiliary splitter. The JVC is about 5 bucks more and well worth it. The bud ends on these headphones are also really flimsy. I can see why people like these headphones as well, but for someone who has headphones on for 3+ hours a day these just aren't for me. Hope this helps."
4,They really are comfortable,"I bought these head phones because the white ones that are now 5.99 died on me after only nine months. So I thought If I paid a little more maybe they'd last a little longer. The other reviews looked promising, others said that they blocked out noise well which is good for me because I take the bus in Philly. But when I tested them, I had to turn the volume up to get them to fully block out noise. That is the only problem I really have, but I like listening to music louder so I don't mind. I really like them and I hope they last longer than nine months!"
2,Deceiving,The sound quality is just avarage. The Noise-Reducing function simply does not exist. It just does not reduce any noise at all!
4,these worked good for us,My boys are always needing new headphones and I needed something with smaller ear pieces so these worked perfectly for us since you get 2 sets of gel like inserts that are different sizes and the price was good!
3,Not Bad for a Sale Item,"The ear buds do block outside noises as advertised, and the iPod is no longer operating at 75% max volume, more like 20-30% range. High-end response of the ear buds is lacking, need to set iPod EQ to treble boost to accommodate."
4,Good for the price,"I bought these headphones after being frustrated with finding ear buds with only asymmetric cords instead of the standard where both sides are the same length. These are a pretty good pair. They look good, and have a very long cord, which makes them easy to plug into a computer jack at work and not be tied too close to the desk.My only really issue is that they don't fit as well as another pair of ear buds that I have. They tend to almost fall out on their own, mainly when running, which can be annoying. However, for all other purposes, including weightlifting, they have been great so far. 4 stars"
2,A Disappointment,"I'm quite disappointed in the JBuds I just purchased. While they are marginally more comfortable than the hard, round earbuds which came packaged with my Sansa MP3 player, the sound quality is certainly no better. I actually think the OEM Sansa earbuds sound a bit better. I purchased the JBuds after reading an article bemoaning the poor quality of earbuds that came packaged with new MP3 players. After reading the many stellar reviews here on Amazon, the JBuds sounded like the obvious choice. Not so, in my opinion. I suppose either the Sansa OEM earbuds are of above-average quality, or the $20 price point of the JBuds just isn't a sufficient upgrade."
1,not worth the money,one ear broke after about 40 days with light use. noise canceling not that good either
2,"Nice sound, but still cheap earbuds","My first impression of these earbuds was great. OK, they were indeed very light and looked kinda cheap, but I was quite impressed with the sound quality for its price. In my opinion, the JBuds sound quality is much better than the standard iPod earphones, for example.However, the honeymoon did not last long. 3 weeks after I got them, the JBuds stopped working. It seems part of the cable is broken, so now only the left side works. This probably has to do with the fact that, because the cable is too long, I often had to squeeze part of it into my pocket. So, since it's a little tight, the cable might have broken somewhere. But, again, this only happened because the cable is: 1) too long, and 2) too weak. This never happened to any of the other earphones I had (including iPod earbuds and other cheap Philips and Aiwa models), so I find it to be unacceptable."
4,"Good headphones, be careful not to loose the tips","I've had these for about 6m now and I really do like them. I run in them and use them at work. The cord is short enough to run in without falling out, but I do have to be careful not to lean back to far in my chair at work (my setups fault). The only problem I ever have is loosing the tips. They fall off (might be my fault too) and are impossible to find. Other than that I love the headphones."
4,"decent, cheap, and comfortable","I purchased these jbuds about 2 years ago. I was pleased with the comfort and fit. Unfortunately, one of the ears stopped working recently. However, I believe that for $10 they are worth having for a few years, especially because of the fit. I just ordered another pair. Also, I am a rough user - these headphones stay in my purse all the time and sometimes get stretched when I drop my mp3 player. Therefore, overall, I think they are a good value."
2,Short Life,Bought 4 pair. WHen they work they sound pretty good. But they each started losing sound out of one ear after about 4 weeks of use. Then eventually out of the other ear. Could jiggle the cord and get sporatic sound. Wires must shear easily causing a short.****** Update*****Company responded to my posting and did a great job providing an acceptable resolution to the issue. I will still purchase products from them. Key for me is a company that stands behind what they sell.
1,jbuds not as good as expected,"Disappointed, the one that came free with my Sansa 240 sound better. poor Sensitivity also"
1,Received for Christmas present and Broken already,They are already making a scratching noise... wish it was a better product.I am not one to listen to music really loud either.
4,Excellent Sound Quality with Durability Issues,"These buds sound awesome and feel ultra comfortable. Buy them for the sound quality and comfort, not the noise reduction. For noise reduction, buy some ear plugs or noise cancelling headphones. These buds would get five stars but for a durability issue. My first pair of buds worked fine for over a year, then the wires inside the stereo jack loosened and rendered one of the buds mute. The same fate claimed my second pair of buds. My third pair of buds work great, but I expect the same problem to occur eventually. The new packaging is smaller and much more environmentally conscious."
3,It's true that one bud will eventually blow,I basically liked these buds but within a few months of having them one ear bud is now dead. Too bad I kinda liked them.
2,Would be awesome if it didn't keep breaking,"It's a shame, the sound quality is great when it works especially for the price. I had bought two pairs of these and sent two of them back because the left side broke, now I am on my fourth pair and after this one breaks (which it obviously will) i am done with J-bud and all of their products forever. If you use these with an i-pod, try to never keep it in your pants pocket, i fear that this might be a factor leading to the left ear problem."
2,Not Good,the left ear phone quit working already. the headphones were good for the most part other than that. this really ticks me off that i just got these like 2 weeks ago and its defective already
2,Lasted all of one week.....,"The audio on these was great, the comfort fantastic and the noise canceling properties were good, also. However, after only one week of little use, the right headphone cut out to about 15% of its original volume, leaving my music one-sided. I have no idea what would cause this. I am sending the headphones back. If you look at this price and think ""too good to be true,"" listen to your gut. It is."
5,Headphone review,"The sound quality on these headphones blew me away. The highs are great and the only headphones I've had with a good bass. Way better than the iphone headphones I had been using that broke (after 9 months) and always fell out of my ear. They don't have volume control, a mic, or a pause button like apples but I didn't buy them for those features. I wanted some good quality headphones that wouldn't cost me an arm or a leg and these are exactly that. I can't wait to hear them after the burn in period of 24 hrs."
3,Could be better,"It fits in my ears very well, as they give you 3 different size ear pieces, however the sound is mushy. The earbuds that came with my Slacker player have much better sound, but they keep falling out of my ears. I would look for earbuds with better sound."
1,"Very bad earphones, definitly not if you are a runner",The earphones worked fine when I opened it from the box. When I wore them while running the left side went out. This was on the second day of my use (I didnt even have to wait for 1 month like others for these earphones to malfunction). A Definite waste of money for me.
1,They've changed?,"I've been buying these for three years, because I seem to break headphones often, so I needed something cheap, but still reasonably good in terms of sound. The latest pair however came in a different looking package (used to be a ziploc-ish bag and now it's a thin flat plastic bag) and sounds just awful. I won't be buying these anymore."
2,What is all the fuss about?,"Sorry but I just don't get it. Although these are indeed comfortable to wear the sound is by no means amazing or anything to get excited about. To me the sound is very muffled, I don't get the deep base or even the mid level sounds. I compared them side by side with the Sansa buds that came with my MP3 player and there is just no comparison. If comfort is all you care about then these are for you, otherwise I would look elsewhere."
2,Price drop and quality drop,"I got a pair of these JBuds for my wife a few years ago for about $15. They sound quite good and she still uses them. I was looking for a new pair of earphones for myself, and I first thought of these. I looked them up and wow, only $6 now? I was surprised and skeptical, but figured I'd take the risk. Well, my skepticism was justified. These don't sound nearly as good as my wife's despite being identical in appearance. Considering the very low price, I probably wouldn't mind if I hadn't already had a good experience with the same model from years ago."
2,The sound was not good,My kids said they were no better than the skull candy ear buds they had that broke easily and the sound was not good as well
1,Dislike product poor quality,My jbuds had a really bad sound i didnt like them I will never order them again.thanks for asking.
3,Just OK,"I purchased these ear buds because frankly, one can never have too many as they are easily lost or damaged. While I enjoyed the sound quality, I didn't notice any significant reduction in the surrounding noise; so I'll go back to my bulky, noise-canceling headphones. As for staying put, I guess I have mutant ears because the earpiece keeps popping out, making my bulky, head-hugging, noise-canceling headphones my first choice for music on-the-go."
3,headphones,"They look nice and they get the job done. But they're cheap quality, so don't expect much more than the bare minimum."
5,Love These!!!!!,Excellent headphones for Excellent price. Would buy again :-). I was very pleased with especially since I have a small ear canal these headphones were a perfect fit.
5,Great Pair!,"I had these for over two years when they failed. I was pretty rough on them and the cable still lasted for that long. Deffinate points for durability. I highly reccomend these ear buds because they fit great, sound good, and are a killer price. After these broke I decided to upgrade to jbuds J2 to see how the j lab audio improved on their product. The sound quality was better, but not by too much. The original jbuds still are the best quality item for 10 dollars, in my opinion. I would reccomend these to anyone who wants a good set (not a great set) that has the possibility to last a long time. But even if they dont last, they are inexpensive enough to buy new ones without breaking the bank."
4,Ear Buds Good Choice,"Switched my strategy on buying ear buds. Instead of buying $25 to $50 every year, I opted to try the $10 version. Bought one additional as back. I'm quite satisfied with my choice. Works well for my audio listening needs. Would buy again"
1,Very uncomfortable,"First of all, let me start by saying that, I could only use these earphones for 3 months, because they literally ""died"". I have just purchased another brand earphones.The first issue that came up was the extra long cord length. This turned out to be more uncomfortable than useful, as it got tangled a lot. Since the ear fit for this brand is not very powerful, any slight touch on the very long cord disrupted the earphone in the ear, it just slipped out of my ear. Secondly, I have tried many many different brands on earphones, but this particular brand turned out to have the least lifetime, which proves that the product is low quality. I am not comparing it to other $1 brands, but when we do a quality comparison, the earphones with the same sound quality are much more durable than this one."
3,"good, but fragile","These were great little $10 earbuds. Unfortunately, the right ear shorted out within 2 months of use."
2,Broke after 4 months,Bought these in the winter and the right earbud stopped working about a month ago. I can still get it to work by jiggling the wire at the plug but have to remain completely still once fixed. It is a huge pain in the ass and makes jogging with them impossible. Considering that I bought these not too long ago I am annoyed and disappointed. Also think that the cord is crazy long making it a bit of a nuisance at times.
5,Nice Earbuds,No problems with them whatsoever. Cord is sometimes too long but it's better than too short. I'd buy them again.
2,not very durable,I bought these as a backup for a more expensive pair of Sennheiser buds. I couldn't have used these more than a dozen times before the left bud went dead. The Sennheisers which have had daily use for over six months are still working beautifully. Just put the money into buying a better set. These were a waste.
4,Confortable and good sound,"I have owned these for about a month and the sound is very good for the price. They fit confortable in my ears too. The noise reduction is not much, they work mostly as earplugs, but is ok for the money. I'm happy with this purchase."
3,ear bud purchase,"i do not know how the second will do, but the first set is already muter in one ear than the other. hopefully the second set lasts for a longer time."
3,They're Okay,"The sound quality on these headphones is not very good. If you're looking for sound quality, you're going to have to pay a bit more. They do the job just fine for me though"
2,Fell apart,"I bought these because they were inexpensive and seemed like a good deal, but obviously you get what you pay for. Definitely not noise reducing and the blue portion that goes in your ear is cheap rubber that fell apart after a few uses and ripped off."
5,Great Earbuds,"Bought these twice I liked the product so much! Great price, fast shipping, awesome sound quality.I would buy these again & would recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality ear bud headphones."
1,Defective Product,"These worked for all of 2 days before they completely crapped out and wouldn't play out of one side, while the other side started to buzz and crackle just a week or so later. Complete garbage headphones. Save your money."
5,Comfy and stylish!,"Exactly as I ordered, decent quality, good audio, comfy, and pretty in pink! I've always been a fan of the gummy kind of earbuds."
4,very good,"it works very good. And you can't hear out, but it cant go so loud as i wanted but overall it pays."
3,Not what I expected,The fit in my ear was not good. The sound was not the qulity I expected. jbugs hI fI NOISE REDUCING FARBUDS
3,You get what you pay for,These where a cheap pair of ear buds. They're not comfortable. Sounds decent. Can't really expect to much from these. They are just OK.
4,Good and cheap,"Good sound thanks to the in-ear speaker. And the three sizes fit most ears. Anyway, after some time the ear phone slips down."
1,Lasted 10 days! (wire at jack came apart),"Nice earbuds, with the larger size grommets, I found them very comfortable.The Problem, they lasted just over a week! The insulation 'tube' covering the wires has separated from the jack - leaving the tiny threadlike wires as the only remaining structural support!Didn't think these would last forever for the price, but I typically can get a few months from very cheap 'dollar store' earbuds. Expected JBuds to be better than that."
1,Terrible sound quality,The sound quality was so bad I sent them back immediately and it wasn't balanced between the left and right sides.
5,Surprisingly Loud.....,"I'll admit that I wasnt expecting too much from these earbuds considering the price was so low for a noise-reducing product but to my surprise these earbuds are FANTASTIC! The sound is extremely clear with the volume at a very high level and the bass (depending on your settings) is very heavy which I love. The fit is like a glove for my ear. I wear these everyday and ALWAYS forget that I have them in when the music is not on, thats how comfortable they are. I recommend this product to all Ipod users."
2,THEY COULD BE ALOT BETTER!,"Read the reviews. seemed OK. got a pair. decent sound. I'm not a big sound-a-phile so I was pleased with the sound reproduction - forsitting on the bus or darting around town - they are/were just fine.the biggest disappointment is the cheap rubber sleeves that cover theearbuds (that are placed in your ear). THEY FALL OFF & YOU LOSE THEM!!the package does come with a replacement pair,BUT THOSE FALL OFF AS WELL!!and once you deplete the originals AND the replacements(which doesn't take long) YOU'RE SCREWED!!THIS IS A HUGE DESIGN FLAW! save your $20.00 & use it to buya better designed product.even though the price was right, i would not recommend these.unless you like sticking a hard piece of plastic into your ear canal!"
3,It's cheap...,"I bought it only because it's cheap... But the volume is sort of small when I use it on my iTouch... Also, after I know the new J-Bud products, I wanna try those. While, if you just wanna a cheap earphone this is fit."
2,6 Month Life Span !?!?!,I bought these in April and they've already shorted out in the left ear from normal use. I have never had an electronics product stop working so quickly. I bought these earbuds for their high user rating and low price but would've preferred to spend more $$$ had I known they would have such a short shelf life.
4,Not too shabby,"For $10, these earbuds have been a pretty good deal. They're the first set of earbuds I've found that will comfortably stay in my ear even while I'm moving about. I can even keep one bud in while the other hangs down and it stays in place. The sound quality is as good as other similar models (of the less expensive variety, that is).The only caveat to them is that, as with virtually every other set of earbuds that I've ever owned, one of the two buds has died after less than a year of use. I mean, if headphones in general aren't the epitome of planned obsolescence, I don't know that is. But for $10, you could do much worse."
4,"They are ok, The shipping was very fast.",I got these ear buds because I needed something to use so I could do voice transcription. I thought they might be better because of the noise reduction. I would say they are probably about as good as my old ear bud. (I lost one of my old ear buds so I only have one).So basically I could have just kept using the old one. I did try them on youtube and they work ok. For the price they are fine. I was happy with how fast they got to me. Once it shipped it only took one day USPS. I think the next time I need ear phones for my work I will probably buy a higher quality ear phone system.
2,No Sound in Left Ear on 2nd use,"Great fit, look and feel but after one use, the left ear stopped receiving sound."
1,Horrible sounding headphones,"This is the first time I have ever bought a product on Amazon and returned it back to them because the product was so bad.After I received the headphones in the mail, I plugged them into my iPod and was very disappointed to hear how TERRIBLE they sounded. There was NO bass at all! I am certainly not a person to be picky about sound quality. I'm not the type of person to spend tons of money on headphones and speakers; I will usually just pick out the least expensive ones and that will suit me fine. However, these were just plain horrible!I do not understand why there are so many good reviews for these headphones on here. In my opinion, they were one of the worst sounding earphones I have ever tried. I couldn't even listen to one song before I decided to send them back and get a refund. Don't waste your money."
2,Sound like tin cans,"These were shown as inexpensive but high quality. Despite ""breaking in"" the buds magnets by leaving them attached to the stereo jack on my tuner for 24hr. at a moderate-high volume, these sounded like you were listening in a tin can. They have a sound that I can best describe as ""boxy."" Other than the fit, there is nothing ""noise-reducing"" about these headphones.I returned them and bought the inexpensive ($16) Sennheiser earbuds which are easily worth the extra $7. Buy the Sennheisers."
4,"Xlnt, especially for the price","These fit my ears well. They cancel the outside noise well. I like the freq. response, although I have a Philips pair that have better bass and more extended highs. However the sound is clean with these earbuds. You can't go wrong with them. I have a couple of pair - and a Y adapter."
2,pricefvbp,"My first time with earbuds. Therefore I may not be knowledgable with how to use them. They come out too easily, especialy when eating something, plus I thought they would reduce outside noise a little. As I wanted them when mowing the lawn?"
3,"distorted sounds, crackles","These ear buds are cheap (at the $10 Amazon price I paid for them), so they won't hurt the wallet, but they don't handle bass very well. The iPod's EQ set to ""bass booster"" caused them to crackle and pop with the volume only turned up a quarter. On other settings the sound was a little flat, but otherwise ok.For the $10 I paid they are good purchase and a decent pair of spare, throw-away ear buds. I'll keep them in my car or bag as a spare set. I wouldn't pay any more than that though. I certainly wouldn't pay the $50 list price for them."
3,Its ok,"i bought one before this one, can't remember which, but i noticed that the sound is kinda fuzzy on this one in comparisonalso, i've had problems since day one with one sounds louder than the other"
3,Not bad for a low cost Item,"I did not expect much from this product, but was pleasantly pleased with the end result. Good buy for this price range."
3,"Good, not near great...","I just got a pair of these and I'll keep this short and to the point! Search for SkullCandy Ink'd and buy a pair of those instead. Depending on the color you choose those can also be picked up for [...]. These JBuds are OK, and probably worth 10 bucks, but the Skull Candy Ink'd model sound much, much better. The highs are higher and more crisp and the lows have a lot more bass as well. (The Jbuds have more of a muffled sound to them.) I also own a pair of Skull Candy Full Metal Jackets and those are incredible as well. Those will set you back 70 dollars or so but very much worth it if you are serious about your music. BTW I bought 6 pair of the Ink'd buds at Christmas for everyone in my family and all of them are still working just beautifully!I have read that these JBuds need a little ""breaking in"" so if things improve I'll stop back by and edit this review."
4,Second pair the charm?,"This is my second pair of JBuds. The first pair stopped working after 3 months. These headphones stay in my ears while I am running. Despite the short life of the first pair, I still consider them a great value for the comfort and the sound and so decided to try this second pair. I am again pleased, and hopefully for a longer time."
3,pretty decent,"These are good headphones. My only problem with them is that they tend to slip out a lot. But their sound quality is great, and the customer service is awesome."
2,Good while it lasted,"A very nice buy...until 10 months later when the wire finally weakened and gave out. Good fit, good sound, good value but unfortunately not built to last."
5,Awesome,"Best headphones for $10 I've ever purchased. Like all the others said, break it in a little. The day I got it, it was slightly tinny sounding on first impression, so I basically plugged it into an MP3 player and let the thing run overnight. By morning, voila, we're in business. If you're looking for complete sound isolation, these probably won't kill out everything surrounding you. But for $10, they've already surpassed my original expectations."
2,JBUDS,THESE EARBUDS DO NOT HAVE THE SAME QULAITY THAT THE EARBUDS THAT CAME WITH MY KINDLE.I WILL BE MORE SELECTIVE WHEN BUYING EARBUDS.
4,Great ear phones,"Great value for the money. They feel good in my ear, and the sound is good. Bass could be a little stronger, but that tends to be a common problem with ear buds. The only complaint is that the Y in the cord needs to be a little larger as sometimes it feels like it's strangling me."
4,Jbuds .vs. Sony MDR-EX51LP Earphones,"I recently purchased the Jbuds (May, 2008) as one of my MDR-EX51LP earphones suddenly stopped working after around a year of use. I typically use the earphones with my iPod when I work out. The Jbuds were about five dollars cheaper. I think the fidelity of the EX51LP's is a little better. Both come with three sizes of earplugs, however, the Sony's would sometimes fall off and I had to then look for them and then place them back on--I have not experienced this problem with the Jbuds. With the jostling in the gym, I hope my Jbuds will last at least a year (as my Sony's did)."
2,great but won't last for too long....,"this product is really great, it works perfect with my ipod, and it cancels the noise around my desk at the office , which is the best. BUT!!!! it's been only 3 months and just yesterday, one of them stoped working, it is so annoying to have music only in one ear!! if u are into that, go ahead because after 3 months that's what you'll have! i guess that considering the price one should not feel so upset ..."
3,"Decent earbuds, so so on the noise reduction part","They are very decent ear buds in terms of sound quality for the money. The noise reduction, however, was minimal for me. I used a cheap imitation of apple's version of the noise reduction ear buds before these (don't know what model, etc.), and those worked many times better at reducing outside sound. These don't fit so snuggly for me, and don't reduce as much outside sound even when they are positioned as best they can be.I give them a ""B"" overall."
4,Very unexpected,"I bought this product months ago and one channel failed. It was past the amazon replacement period but there was a 1 year warranty. I didn't have receipt or any other documentation. I emailed the company with my amazon receipt in the body of the email. In less then a hour I recieved an email back saying they would send me a new pair. That was on a thursday. Monday I received the new earbuds -- WOW !! I would reccomend buying the case, sold by the company, to keep your buds blooming."
5,What a steal!,These ear buds are a fantastic deal. The sound is awesome for the price. Just got them to use with my iPod touch for listening on the train on the way to work and home. Great deal!!
5,The best company I've ever dealt with!,"Great product (Although I would/did get the J2s also). They replaced my product when it went bad, and gave me a free case. Its amazing how fast they took care of my problem. I'll be wearing their products for a long time to come.Oh yeah, I'm no expert music listener, but I notice a lot more detail in my music. They are very comfortable, and great for wearing in the gym as they hardly ever fall out of my hear. Thumbs up."
2,Loved 'em... 'till they broke!,"These had great sound, fit, and balance for running ... until the left ear bud went dead 6 miles into a half-marathon. Something went wrong in the connection between wires and the base of the headphone plug.Admittedly, I didn't try to warranty them; I'm sure I have lost the packaging and receipts.Good for sound, not up for active use.UPDATE: The customer service email was very courteous and sent me a replacement set of J-Buds. I didn't even have to return the broken set! I'm impressed."
2,It's depressing,"Well, I bought the jbuds on september 29, 2008 and was excited when I got them because they sounded great. Well today its november 19, 2008 and they just stopped working. Can someone imagine if I bought them at the store for full price. Are you serious!!! 2 month lifespan. That's dissapointing and its not the first time this has happened. I bought some more than a year ago and i bought them this time in hopes that they would be better produced. I WAS WRONG."
3,Good for the price - comfortable,"I have had these ear buds for a few days ..my first pair that actually fit and feel comfortable, and sound pretty good. I like earphones that mount on the outer art of the ear, as well as conventional earmuffs or open foam headsets for better sound. However these are handy for jogging, walking, anywhere where you don't want to carry larger headsets, or are afraid of loosing a more expensive pair.One caveat: don't be tempted to adjust the snugness of the ear bud wires under your chin, until you are sure about how far to adjust them ..as in pulling them apart a little. If you plan on jogging, you really need a snug fit so that the excess ear bud wires don't flop around transmitting unwanted vibration sound up the wires to your ears. I regret that I adjusted mine too loose for jogging. I will have to tape the two wires back together to readjust :-/"
5,this are worth,actually i expected less from this but what a good surprise they are great good bass and treble ..the cord is long enough to do everything without to bother at all they came well packed and protectedand trust me once you put them in yours ears you wont be able to hear almost anything even if the sound is off ..nice noise reducingnot complains...
3,Uncomfortable,"These worked fine other than I found them uncomfortable. I've used all kinds of ear buds but these just hurt my ears. Either they seemed too big or went too deep into my ear (but I will admit to being a bit sensitive about things in my ears). And while I knew the cord was a bit shorter than what I wanted and was used to, they still ended up being too short for ease of use. I ended up giving them away, but at least I didn't spend too much money on them. Just not for me."
2,Terrible sound quality! Yikes.,"I got these to replace my iPod headphones, but they are a downgrade--for sure. They sound just dull and heavy. I would stay away from these. $18 wasted."
2,No JKoss!,"Oops! Read the WHOLE name before you buy! I saw the ""J"" and assumed I was buying a JKoss product... these are a far cry from that. They work OK but the sound quality is worse than the cheap Sony buds I bought from my college bookstore. It it weren't such trouble to return a product purchased online, I never would have kept these things."
2,Loose,These ear buds don't really stay in my ear... They do have good sound but I'm always afraid they will fall out on the stairmaster
1,Very disappointing,I should have known it was too good to be true. When will I learn ya get what you pay for!
2,Good at first - Breaks quickly,"These headphones were perfect at first, which is why I gave them a star. After 5 weeks, the sound is now very staticky in one ear and cuts in and out frequently. It is very annoying and now I have to buy new ones."
3,Amazon Verified Purchase,I bought these as an upgrade to the ear buds that came with the MP3 player I got my son. He isn't so impressed with them. He likes the ones that came with his player better. I beleive it has to do with how they feel in his ears. Not the sound quality.
2,Sounds and looks good Horrible Durability,"The Good: Great sound, comfortable in ear, can change the ear bud cushion.The Bad: Durability, I go to put the ear buds in and I notice the wire is exposed. For no reason the wire was exposed, now granted i put tape around it and it still works, but I would not buy again."
3,My wife still doesnt like them...,"After buying 3 type of replacement ear-buds for her ipod, we still haven't found one that suits her. They work and thats all I can say for that."
5,Great product,Great product for the use and for the money. Very Comfy to use. Sound quality is very good as well as outside noise is well blocked. I would buy it again.
2,check footnotes in compatibiltiy,"Small warning. These headphones are listed as compatible with ipods, but then there's a small foot note that says it's really only compatible with some ipods, that is the ones that don't need volume control. My Ipod did need volume control on the headphones, and I didn't notice that footnote til after I was mailed the product. Looks like it would work in anything that just takes a standard small headphone input."
3,Comfort Comes at a Price,"These are the most comfortable ear buds that I have ever used; however, the sound quality fell far short of what I expected. The biggest drawback is the bass reproduction. I've found that these ear buds deliver very little bass and when coupled with an equalizer the bass will distort badly. Overall, this is an excellent product for the price. In my opinion, the comfort makes up for the sound inadequacies. I use these when I am on the go and use a much better pair (Sennheiser) when I want a true audiophile experience."
4,Item as advertised,I purchased this item for airplane travel and for use when mowing the lawn. It does reduce the outside noise so it is not necessary to turn the volume up quite so loud.
4,Great sound quality,The JBuds work great. Plain and simple they are awesome for the every day person. The only problem i had with them is that they would trap in ear wax in the little rubber part but it is removable and can be cleaned.The sound isolation lets you listen to your music without having to crank it to Eleven to hear it and that is really helpful if you are in a medium noise level area.
2,Limited Durability,"My headphones shorted-out after a couple months. First my right headphone gave out and then a couple weeks later the same with the left one. I had a replacement plan, but the same thing happened with my second set! Apparently, this has happened to many other customers. Moral of the story: Pay more and go with SOny."
2,"Get, but be warned","I don't know, i might of been that one in a hundred, but when i got the head phones, the left side didn't have any bass, so it sound really messed up. but it fits fine, it kind of noise reducs, and looks pretty cool, but just be warned"
3,Ear buds....,"I came to find I like earbuds if i'm not moving...If I'm working out at all or mowing the lawn or anything that has upper or lower body movement, these suck. HOWEVER, if comatose is how you roll, than these bad boys are the JOINT. Me? I have a heart beat so they don't work so well. To each his own."
3,I was..,I like the style and the sound is good but they keep falling off even when I changed the ear plug pieces that they give you.
2,I really liked them... until they stopped working,"They did well for the two or so months I used them. I wore them on a daily basis on my work commute. However, I am very careful about how I treat my earbuds and I don't think I was overly rough on them. I am not an audiophile so I can't speak to the actual quality compared to other headphones; they sounded fine, and I was pretty happy with them. Then... the day came that the sound in the left ear started intermittently going out--an internal wire came loose, I'm not sure--which pretty much rendered them unusable. Very disappointing. I went back to my standard Apple-issued earbuds, which do nothing to reduce noise, but at least they keep on truckin'."
2,"Comfortable, but defective right out of the box.","These seem like such an amazing value on paper, but straight out of the box, only one side of the earphones works. I was afraid it was my ipod, but testing these with other devices (and my ipod with different earphones) revealed that the earphones were defective.I purchased these to have an inexpensive set of earphones to use while sleeping, as I don't want to risk damage to my favorite Bose earphones. The price was right, and they were very comfortable (even for a side-sleeper like me), where the Bose feel like little rocks in my ears while trying to sleep.If you want them for noise-cancelling, however, do not waste your time with these. Both with the original pads on the earbuds, AND changed to the tiered ones by the same brand, the noise cancelling of these is virtually nonexistent.If you want cheap and comfortable, I say go for it. Just plan on possibly having to return them if you get a pair that is defective."
1,One bud died after 1 month.,"Bought two of these and in both cases one bud died after 1 month. don't waist your money, pay a little extra and buy something more durable."
2,JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (White),"Just really not a fan of this style of ear phones. do not fit well, not real compy. Product was shipped fast so no complaints about the handler just not a fan of this product."
5,got it,Love it... perfect as expected. Thanks for the being so professional. I will recommend and continue doing business with you.
5,work great!,"These work with my iPad mini with no problems. Good price, good quality, no hesitation recommending to anyone who needs ear buds."
5,Great sound for the price.,For the price they are great. The sound is nice I mean it's not the greatest thing you ever heard but it's good.
2,Defective Product,"Within a week of receiving this product, the plastic cover on the lead wire brokeexposing the bare wires. This was with normal use, and very little use.On the other hand, the sound quality is excellent."
5,Sound great and comfortable to wear,"I bought these as a gift for my wife (stocking stuffer ok) and she loves them! The soft, extended ear pieces have various sizes you can fit to accomodate your ears. Also, it carries sound better than el-cheapo ear buds."
4,Not bad!,The Jbuds are a pretty decent item for the price and worked real well one night working with a noisy floor buffer.I'd buy another pair.
1,Same problem! Sound died in one ear,"I bought the JBuds in September to replace my second broken pair of the nice in-ear earbuds from Apple (not the standard pair that comes with an iPod, but the $40 pair). I apologize for digressing, but both Apple pairs absolutely fell apart within a year each time and were not fixable, plus I didn't like the way they fit.The JBuds initially felt alot better than the Apple earbuds ever did, and they had less intricate parts, meaning that they couldn't fall apart in the same way. The sound is comparable - I guess I'm not much of an expert on sound quality. But now, just a bit over 6 months after I started using them, the right ear bud has started having tons of static, cutting in and out, and most of the time not working at all. I know they were cheap, but this feels unacceptable. At least they're cheaper to replace than the Apple earbuds, but goodness - how hard is it to find a lasting, quality pair of headphones????"
5,Good experience,"When flying in light airplanes, you definitely need to use some noice reducing earbuds and when traveling, alternatives like this ones are great to use and allow you to really enjoy a great sound quality. This has been a great investment!!"
1,Bad quality,"I have this for alredy 3 weeks and one of the buds doesn't work anymore, at the beginning the quality of sound was good, but the durability is not!"
3,noise isolation with a twist,The JBuds do the job as described and the price was right. I have used many earbuds before but for me this pair creates a sort of vacuum that can be uncomfortable.
1,Nice until they break.. which they will,"About 4 months into purchase, right headphone no longer works. For 20 bucks.. I'd expect more durability.. other than that, they have nice sound. Invest in more expensive headphones.. save yourself money in the end."
2,Itchy with Poor Quality Sound,Didn't like these at all. The fabric irritated the ear channel & the quality of the sound wasn't high. I did not find them to be noise-reducing at all.I bought them on Amazon deeply discounted & I see why the price was so appealing. 'You get what you pay for' & these were a waste of money.
1,100% JUNK,"What junk. The first pair I received, only 1 earbud worked. I returned it for an exchange. The second pair I received worked for about a month and now the same problem happened. Only this time I can't return them because return time ran out about a weak ago. So in conclusion, if you like earbuds that one side goes in and out with static noise, then this is for you, otherwise stay away unless you like throwing $$$ away.Update:I'm giving 50% apologies to the vendor. Although the first pair did not work 100% (even when moving the chord), the second pair (replacement)may work. I bought more headphones (earbuds) and same problem. It has to be my sansa clip 4+ mp3 player. I'm going through the process with them for a replacement."
2,I was deceived by good reviews,"I was looking for a replacement of my Sony ear buds. I ran into good reviews of JBuds and decided to give it a try. It was very disappointed to find out that JBuds didn't have bass at all, it was like listening to the phone. High frequency were fine, the buds fit into ears OK. I tried to lie on the pillow with ear buds in, but it was not comfortable. If you like to listen to music, stick to Sony, for about the same money their buds are much better."
3,not impressive,"the headphones do not respond to music with bass. Sound good only on vocal and speach, very poor on music with bass."
1,Would be perfect...if they lasted,"These earphones are a perfect price and are the most comfortable earphones I have found. I have small ears and most earphones fall out, but the small interchangeable pair of ear buds are perfect for me. When I first got them the sound and noise reduction were very good. However, after about 3 months the right earbud stopped working and I have to hold the wire just the right way to hear anything from the left earbud. I was extremely disappointed that I finally found a pair of earbuds that fit me, but then they stopped working after a few months.I thought maybe if I invested some more money, I would get a longer-lasting pair -- so I bought the J2 earbuds which are about $5 more than the first edition. Same thing happened, I've had them for about 3 months now and I have to wiggle the wire and hold it the right way to keep any kind of sound.Sadly, my hunt for a pair of earphones that both fit and plays music continues."
2,J Buds,"Sound quality is good, but they keep falling out of ear. They have different size buds for the ear, but it doesent make any difference. Useless."
4,Ear Buds,I thought the JBuds were pretty good for the money. They handle a wide range of sounds including bass fairly well.They come with extra ear inserts and two different sizes. I thought that was a nice touch. The smaller size fits well in my ears and I haven't had them fall out.I would buy them again if I wanted something in the $20 price range.
2,Gave me an ear infection.....,"I wore these at the gym - big mistake. They kept popping out due to sweating, so I kept putting them back in, pushing sweat deeper into my ears. I'm convinced that these things gave me an ear infection, which ultimately led to a plugged ear, ear drops, and a trip to the ENT.The sound quality is ok but not as good as the iPod headphones, IMO. They are too heavy on the bass. The noise reduction works ok, but your own breathing, coughing, humming, etc., reverberates loudly, also making them not good for wearing while exercising.So, if you're only using these at work or on the plane or while sitting quietly, maybe they're ok. Do not use them while exercising, as you may end up with an ear infection."
1,ouch.,The sound it produces hurts my ears...I couldn't take just using them for 10 minutes. I got new iPod ear buds instead. Works 100x better!
2,not the best ear buds,"If you're looking for a phenomenal pair of buds, don't look here. These are just ok. Sound is good, but the fit could be better. Overall, this item is a decent buy."
1,"ear buds with ""noise reduction""",Although this is listed as having noise reduction this is really a stretch. They use the term noise reduction to refer to the fact that being placed in your ear it blocks outside noise the same way that cotton would do. Really stretching the truth in advertising to the limit.
3,It's just ok,"The sound you get it's ok for the price you pay. The negative part is that they hardly stay in my ears when I'm active (running, working out, etc.).HT"
3,Ear Bud' fit,"This is the third pair of ear buds I have tried--apparently my ears are not made for using these things as although these fit the best of the ones I've tried, I still have problems keeping them in. I'm not sure it is JBuds' problem--maybe there just isn't anything out there that will work for me."
3,Fine for the price,"I find the sound a little muffled or bass heavy, but they are fine for the price and the fit my ears well."
2,one bud doesn't work,"I'm pretty sure, though it's subtle, that one bud doesn't work as well as the other. Tried in both ears and one was just not as loud. I bought them to listen to low quality classroom recordings, so it's almost impossible to hear with the one working. Return shipping would be more than they cost, so obviously keeping them. The noise-cancelling aspect works ok."
2,Not the best headphones.,I bought these based on the reviews left. I'll say they're okay but honestly I feel like Apple's iPod headphones are way better. I bought these to use at the gym and they ALWAYS fall out of my ear. And after an hour or so of wearing them they're uncomfortable. I would not recommend these to anyone.
4,Not the best,"Well worth the cash, but I've had way better sounding buds in the past but they've cost twice as much.Sound is clear but each side (left and right) had a bit different level of Quality.But as stated .... worth the cost."
1,avoid this earbud,I bought Jbud earbud about 2 months ago. Now right side stops working suddently. It has been used moderately about 3 or 4 hours a week. I believe the cord is too thin to cause this problem. Try to avoid this product.
2,Dissapointing,I bought these to replace a pair of sony fontopias I had. I loved the sonys but was trying to save some money and most of the reviews seemed favorable. While they are ok earphones I was dissapointed with the sound range and quality. They really dont block out much ambient noise and the fit is not very comfortable. For 20.00 they work but I wouldnt order them again.
2,JBuds ear buds do not reduce ambient noise,"Unfortunately, the JBuds were disappointing to say the least.Purchased after reading reviews of the headphone but after one flight with it, I had to return it. It did almost nothing to reduce the ambient noise inside the airplane. Purchased JVC HA-FX33-A for $20 and am very happy with it. It has foam ear pieces for far better noise reduction and comfort. Hope this helps."
5,Super Buds!,My old iPod buds finally wore out after a year so my son got me a pair of these. My daughter stole them from me and really liked them. She never did like the iPod original buds.So I had to get another pair for myself. Great sound! Great Value!
4,Almost perfect,"I bought this ear buds couple of weeks ago and thay are great,thay fit well and because of noise reducting propertice I can decreasethe volume 25%. They can save a lot of power and they give crisp sound.The only thing is that the cable is not soft and it jumps when you runwhich create knocking sound but you can easly do something about it.Really good for the cheap ones.You can use them with whatever player, of course.I hope they will last couple of years ;-)))"
3,"Sound fine, feel unpleasant","I am not a reliable source for reporting on sound quality as I tend to only notice when sound is excellent or terrible--and these provide sound that's perfectly passable, if not perfect--but I will say that the floppy, plastic-y earbuds not only feel unpleasant, but also slip out of my ears. Especially if you intend to use these at the gym where you may be getting a bit sweaty, I wouldn't recommend these. Though they do come with three different size plastic ""slip covers,"" they are all slippery and, again, unpleasant-feeling."
5,Amazing sound quality,"I purchased these not expecting a whole lot but I was pleasantly surprised. The quality of the sound coming through is fantastic and they fit my small ear canals quite well. The only thing I'm not sure about is that they're supposed to be black/chrome/silver but there is no chrome or silver on them. No big deal, really, but if you're looking for something flashy these aren't it."
2,JBuds ear plugs,"One ear plug died shortly after purchasing. The plugs are comfortable and good quality sound, but not very reliable. I would recommend to keep looking."
1,wow - these SUCK!,Just got these delivered. It took about 10 seconds of listening to realize just how crappy these are. The sound is muddy and foggy with no clear highs and a bass that's unpleasant even at lower volumes. These make the standard Ipod earbuds seem genius - and we all know they're not. Please - don't make the same mistake I just did. These are total crap!!!
2,"Fits well, terrible sound","I expected these earbuds to sound better than my original ear buds that came with my ipods, they did not.They sounded terrible and anything coming out it becomes distorted and flat. There is a large sound quality reduction going to this from my original ear buds, I advise no one to buy this if they want to listen to stereo music.However, they are comfortable and block out sounds to some degree since it fits well in your ear, if you are into reading and not listening to music, the sound quality is acceptable.I don't know why everyone else thought this sounded good."
4,much better than ipods,"Let me first start out with saying these are exceptionally comfortable ear buds and they come with three different sizes for max. comfort. They fit snuggly in my ear reducing almost all background noise without the volume having to be too loud. The wire is also much longer than the ipods. Sound quality cannot be beat for 26 dollars. Crisp, clean and clear. Only songs that don't sound great are ones with a lot of bass... had to go to EQ on ipods settings and use the bass reducer to get a better sound. ***Update*** Ear buds broke about a year and a half later."
3,Good Sound - One ear fail then other,"The sound on these is the best I've found in this price range. I've been extremely happy with them in that regard.The down side is that the pair of ""JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds"" and the pair of ""Coby CVE92 Isolation Stereo Earphones"" I've had both failed in one ear in about 3-4 months and in the other ear around 2-3 months later.I'm assuming this is the same pair of headphone just branded differently.Since they are so cheap (~10-15 bucks at my time of purchase) they are probably worth the money especially if you a kind to them. I use them daily at work and wind up the cord after each use. Also, I use them when I'm running.It would easily be a 5 star rating even if I got a year out of these guys."
5,A good Deal,"These little baby's work wonderful. The bass, treble, and mids sound good. They do not distort when turned up all the way on my mp3 player, CD player, or my laptop. I would recommend this product to anyone and they are a great deal for the money. I would expect to pay at least $20 for these anywhere else."
1,don't buy,Sound quality is below average and the bass is very distorted. Just bought a pair of 'go groove' ear buds for only 12.99 from amazon and the sound quality is 10 times better.
4,"You get what you pay for, solid pair of ear Buds","Worth the little extra you have to pay, good sound quality. I like these headphones,I had one pair that lasted about 3 months and one ear cut out on me, but I ended up buying another pair simply based on sound quality.I would recommend these ear buds, just be careful with them!"
2,Wire is bad,These are amazing for the price. The bass is just right and it didnt really take any time to get broke in. The problem is that the wire will break after a while. They will sound just fine but if you want a better pair that wont break get sony xb500's extra bass.
2,Short-lived use,I got these in winter 2011/12 and it's now 6 or 7 months later and one ear bud already doesn't work. I haven't over-used or abused them - my last pair I wore through because I wasn't using them properly (it was a different brand). This pair has just not lasted at all. Very dissatisfied.
3,Lasted 5 months,The ear buds had good sound and price was good but they only lasted 5 months before one of the sides quit working.
1,Waste of Money,"I bought this item ""Jbuds Hi-Fi Noise Reducing Ear Buds"" 3 months ago, and one ""of the speakers has quit working! One speaker works fine. I dont recommend this product to anybody!"
3,"Great product, not for the long run or for rough users","I purchased this product last December, and rate 3 stars for durability. The sound quality and cancellation were good, not amazing, and the plugs were comfortable. Overall, they're a great product for the price and I was happy with the choice. However, after 7 months or so, the left speaker bit the dust. I am a fairly vigorous user and have used them at least 5 days a week on my commute. Overall, I recommend the product (especially to test your feel with in-ear headphones), but I personally have spent the extra 15 bucks on a Sennheiser CX300-S this time around."
1,Broke after 3 months,"These headphones are horrible and poor quality. I have only had mine for 3 months, and they are already broken. I get no sound out of the left ear now. The cord is so long that it is simply impossible for it not to get tangled or become a nuisance. I had gotten these headphones precisely because the ones that came with my ipod were not working well and the left ear plug produced no sound. Now, I have the same problem with these.By contrast, I got my wife the Coby CVE92 Isolation Stereo Earphones, which is cheaper, has better sound, and still works."
1,Stopped working after a couple months,"Good sound quality, but the the left one stopped getting sound after just a few months when only used moderately. Disappointing."
2,"Good, but didn't last...","I really liked these earbuds, but this morning they failed after 4 months of use. I would judge myself as a moderate user (meaning, I put things to good use, but am relatively cautious about how I take care of my things). I ordered the jbuds based on reviews from other customers. They have a good sound quality. They are definitely comfortable compared to my ipod's manufacture ear buds (ouch)_I have small ear canals. But this morning, when I put my ipod on, only the right side had sound (quite low I might add) and the left side would come on if I wiggled the cord. So, it shorted out in only a few months. If you get these buds I would order the travel case too. I did not and maybe if I had it might have extended the life I my jbuds. Meaning_don't wrap your buds around your mp3 player_it might have been it's surmise!"
2,rather disappointing,considering the original price I was expecting better sound from these than they actually produced; the clearance price was more right on for what you get
1,crappy product,"These earbuds have really crappy wiring. After about 3 or 4 days, the headset is shorting out. I would never buy these again. I purchased the Coby Earbuds for a third of the price and they are working just fine"
3,"good, cheap earphones...","i needed cheap headphones since my last ones gave out...i read all the reviews and didnt expect much out of this pair.. i didnt like them at first..but its already been a couple of weeks of owning them, and i dont know if i already have got used to them, or maybe they are sounding better with time..i just checked the packaging and it says to give them 24 hours of break in time...i figure thats how long ive been listening to them that theyve finally broken in...i am pleased...i am more pleased that i got a $5 mp3 credit from amazon after buying these, which equals to $5 for these!! good deal..."
2,Over rated,"I didnt expect much from a budget bud type earplugs. I decided on the Jbuds as it was cheap and it was branded. Hoping that a brand name would give me some assurance on quality.My buds cracks on the minimal of Bass, I listen to all range of music from folk to rap to rock. As I type, I am listening to Incubus and I can hear crackling sound. I have these for 2 months now and I would think it is pretty run in.Like most said, it works well with dialog.. when I play my FIFA games.Otherwise, my previous china brand buds works better."
5,Great Earphones,"They work great, fit my ears and don't fall out when I am working out or running on the treadmill. The sound is also very good."
2,Sounds great (When working),"They shorted out after 2 months. I used them everyday, so they are not good for everyday use. Maybe something a little more casual. Tried finding their website, to see about replacing, with no luck. They sound good when they were working."
1,"good, if you don't move","This design isn't good for movement. They don't stay put very well and are always ""just on the verge"" of falling out of my ear. I used them for 2 months anyway, until the left ear bud lost it's sound (I think from a break in the internal wire). Now they are trash. My advice, pay the extra money and buy a better pair."
3,Great Until Left Stopped Working,"I really loved my JBuds - the sound was great (I barely had my iPod volume over 50% most of the time), they really drowned out the outside noise and they were super comfortable. Hands down, they were a great buy and I was super happy with them for over a year.However, yesterday I picked up my iPod to walk to work only to find that the left bud wasn't working. If I moved the cord around it would come in and out but it never stayed on consistently - flashback to when you try to get the sound for a movie in an airplane using your own headphones and you struggle trying to get the jack to go in just the right amount to get sound in both ears....annoying! Anyway, sad to say I can't use them now since it's obviously a problem with the wiring and I'm pretty sure my warranty ran out after a year.So I guess buy them if you can make sure you're careful with the cord! While they work, they're great :o)"
4,A great bargain,"This will be short. These are the second purchase of earbuds that I made, the first being some discount type in Thailand which self destructed quickly. These buds though were on sale for about $10 each and are wonderful. They do shut out noise, not all of it, but enough to be useful and the sound is excelent. The only reason for four stars is that I haven't got enough experiencwe with other earbuds to compare these to. I bought three of them.Harold"
2,Not bad while they last,"These earbuds worked normally for about 6 months, then just randomly crapped out on me. I guess for $10 I wasn't expecting a lifetime guarantee, but a little disappointing nonetheless. Hope I can find something better to replace them!"
2,Wore them 3 days ago. My ear still hurts.,"I usually wear the ""Medium"" size covers for other earbuds but medium felt big for these so I switched to the small ones. I wore them on a flight I took 3 days ago and can still feel like they stretched something in my ear. It even hurts to sleep on my side at night because they did something to my ear.The sound quality is ok but nothing special and definitely not worth the discomfort."
1,Great deal--till they broke after three months,"I was very pleased with these headphones until, three months later, one of the headphones got scratchy and then stopped transmitting unless the cord was moved in a very precise way. A week later the other side went out. Now I only occasionally get sound in only one ear at a time if I have manipulated the cord in a very specific way.I am really mad that I spent even $10 on these. They clearly weren't worth it."
3,You get what you pay for,Not really impressed. Hollow sound and popping noise due to the poor fit while jogging.
1,Good sound quality; awful durability,"I've been using these for a month. Sound quality is great. However, one of the channels started losing sound after week 2. No sound coming out of that channel after 4 weeks. Not worth the money even at the discounted rate."
2,I got what I paid for...,"After using these headphones for a few days, I'm not very satisfied. They have poor bass response, they don't fit well and overall, they sound distant or muted. While these earbuds have a crisp tone, they don't produce any warmth or brilliance. I'd read a lot of good reviews on these buds, and it really makes me wonder if any of those people really cared about sound quality at all?"
1,Get what you pay for,"Halfway decent sound quality, very cheap housing and cableing. Plastic housing doesn't last, even if careful. The wires seperated at the joint and at base of bud, causing static sounds after only 1 month. I am careful with my stuff, but a minor tug will destroy these lame buds. They do plug ears (noise-cancel) relatively well. Cheap, Cheap, Cheap."
5,Good value,"I've been using these now for about 4 months and they have worked very well for me. The long cord is especially useful because I like to put my iPod in my pocket when I'm running, walking, mowing the lawn, etc. The noise reduction is pretty good, but being my first pair of in ear headphones I don't have anything else to compare it to. I'm not an audiophile and mostly use my iPod to listen to podcasts, so they work well for that purpose."
2,Not worth the trouble,"I bought a pair of these in Sept. 0f '07 because Apple headphones suck and hurt my ears. I enjoyed these for the first few months, the sound quality was much better than my old ones and they were comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Then after about four months, the left ear stopped working unless I turned the cord a specific way and didn't move it at all, which was a pain. A few weeks later, the left ear stopped working altogether so I e-mailed the company for a replacement (they come with a 1 yr. warranty). Two months after I got the replacement, the left ear also died completely on that one. My FOURTH pair in under a year also just died and, despite the warranty being valid for a few more months, the company refuses to replace them anymore. These aren't worth the $20 they charge and there are others that are half the price with similar sound that last much longer. Don't waste your money or your time."
2,Only 3 months...,"That's the time i used these earbuds, only 3 months until the left side earbud didn't work no more. I have a pair of Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia which are great but the only two problems of the Sony Fontopia are the design(left earbud shorter than right earbud) and the silicone earbud gets loose alot. So I read some reviews from buyers about the JBuds, the majority were good reviews so i gave these earbuds a try. Here are the pros & cons from my experience...Pros:Reasonable priceNoise-reducing not badDesign & exterior material were perfect compare to the Sony FontopiaCons:Sound quality was BADSound volume TOO LOWDidn't last longIf these earbuds didn't have those cons than these earbuds would've been perfect. If you want to give them a try go ahead, but i don't recommend them...."
1,Didn't even last two months,"I was very upset with these headphones. When I first recieved these in the mail I was dissapointed that they felt a little cheap but I decided to give them a try. Now, not even two months later they are already shorting out. I would encourage people not to buy these..."
4,Product Review,Quality is good. Ear pieces fit well. Only negative comment is the length of the wire is too long. I am always getting it caught in something.
1,Short Life Makes for a Frustrating Purchase,"I purchased these headphones after reading glowing reviews from many customers. An in-ear and inexpensive headphone: What's not to love?!I was extremely satisfied with the headphones until yesterday. After one month of perfect quality, the left earbud suddenly died. Given just one month of gently use, my headphones have been rendered completely useless.Do not waste your money on this product, unless you are willing to buy another pair after one month's time."
2,NO Noise-Cancelling Technology,I returned this item un-opened and can't comment on product quality.I was fooled by the product description into thinking these 'phones incorporate noise cancellation technology. They do not. Any noise reduction is by means of blocking out surrounding noise with padded ear-buds. Maybe this works better than I think it would but I'm looking for true noise cancellation and thus won't try these.
3,Slightly above average...,I'm no big audiophile and I bought these because they were cheap. I'd say they are slightly above average. Unfortunately they seem to fall out of my ears when I run. For $10 it's hard to complaint though...
2,"You get what you pay for, I guess","Having purchased and enjoyed the JBuds-J2 earbuds, I gambled on an even cheaper set of the originals. I realized almost immediately that the sound was vastly inferior to the J2s; there's no ""body"" to it, just a thin representation of the music. I listen mostly to classical and now have the task of getting my wife to agree to trade this shiny new set for the J2s I gave her when these arrived."
4,"Average earphones, good lows","I bought a pair for less than $7 - it worth it. As usual the cords don't look durable, the length is quite long - it has enough length to attach them to the iMac ( back of the LCD) while sitting behind it on descend distance. Low frequencies are very good if you properly place them into your ears - you can hear the low basslines on dubstep tracks."
1,"Do not but, 2 out of 3 broken in less than 2 weeks","Ordered on the 23rd of november, it is now dec 4th and two of the three sets I ordered are broken. One set does not work at all and the other set has just a buzzing sound in one of the earbuds. Well let's see how long the third set lasts. Do not buy, do not buy, try the Coby buds, they are cheaper and do not break as bad as these.Update on 12/18/2010 3rd set, lost the left bud , just crackling and hissing. Do not buy, junk."
2,These ear buds do not last,"These ear buds sound and feel great. However, I've been through two pairs of these over the course of 5 months, they tend to fall apart. Specifically, the right ear bud on both pairs just stopped working, I learned my lesson after the second purchase. I found cheaper and better ear buds, stay away from these."
3,Just OK,"Not great but not bad.I had expected more and better tone. Spend more and get more as the say , Not for music ."
2,"Cheap, uncomfortable earbuds.","I got these as a daily deal so it was relatively inexpensive. You get what you pay for. The earbuds, made from hard plastic, don't fit comfortably in my ears. After about an hour, my ears start hurting. These are usable, and the sound quality is fine, but I wouldn't use it for an extended period of time. The only earbuds I've found worse are Skull Candy brand which was a ginormous metal gob of an earbud which hurt my ears to because of the physical hardness as well as the undesired shape. These earbuds are quite similar in that they're not thin long enough to protrude from your ear without pushing against some part of your ear. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone except a 12 year old on a skimpy allowance."
5,blue JBuds,My grandaughter had these on her Christmas list and could not decide if she wanted blue or purple; with Amazon's great prices we got both blue and purple. She will be delighted and I was delighted to find it so easily.
4,Works well,The sound is good. Best I've heard on the in ear style head phones in this price range. I would say they are not noise reducing especially on a plane. During plane rides it is very hard to get consistent volume on these and I had adjust the volume so much it was annoying. I Will use these for everything but airplane rides. I'll get real noise canceling headphones for that.
2,I liked these to start with,"These were great when I first got them, they would fit in my ear well and the sound was good. After a month or two though they gave me an electric shock inside my ear, which was very painful and made me slightly deaf in that ear for a few days. I contacted JLab and told them what happened and the happily replaced them. The second pair worked fine like the others, but then after only a few weeks they gave me an electric shock inside my ear too. I know I never wore these in rain or pulled on the cords, and I was always careful about storing them. These have been the only kind of headphones, out of 10 I have owned in my life, that have given me an electric shock.I give one star to the headphones, and another for JLab for responding promptly and replacing them."
2,decent for price,"I really like in ear head phones and have had many pairs but for some reason these just did not fit in my ears. Not that great of sound quality. Nothing special, you get what you paid for."
2,Lasted 4 Months,"I bought these based of the good reviews. The sound quality was good, but not the longevity. I used the earbuds a couple of times a week for several months before the cord failed causing the music to cut in and out, thus rendering them useless. When I say the cord failed, I mean the cord base near where the headphones plug into your device. There is no visual signs of fraying, but if I move the cord in that area the music becomes audible again. I'll look for a headphones with an L-type attachment next time."
1,Short of expectations.,These headphones were fantastic at first but after only a month the right earphone shorted out. Short while after that they were too worthless to use anymore. Im disappointed...
2,"sound good, but cheap","These things sound really good and were extremely comfortable in my ears. However, after a week the right bud started coming apart and the wires became exposed. A week after that the wire completely broke, and I couldn't listen to them at all anymore. If you are rough on your stuff and throw your ipod and headphones in your bag a lot, these are not for you. Then again, they sound great, and I could have gotten a dud pair."
2,Not like they used to be,"I bought these 'phones 2 years ago and really liked them. They were great for the price and probably the best option for earphones for less than $20.However, they weren't the most durable things, so when the sound started cutting out of the left ear, I needed a replacement. They were so cheap, I thought I would just purchase again as I had got a lot of use out of them and liked the sound quality.They definitely changed something in the new models, though. The sound quality is completely different. It is a lot more fuzzy and muffled, and worse than the earphones you get stock with an ipod or CD player. Huge disappointment, and I will never buy these ones again. Even the cord is thinner and they even cut serious costs with the packaging. I'll probably never buy from this company knowing that that is how much they cut the quality of a product after they know they already have a ton of good reviews and ratings to ride on."
3,"great comfort & sound, but the right ear bud stopped working almost 1 yr. to the day!","I loved these ear buds right away. The sound is good quality, it does block out noise & very comfortable in the ear. It comes with fittings to adjust the comfort in your ear. The only disappointment is they only lasted a year. All of a sudden the right earbud quit working. There is a short in it...if I hold the wire just right, the right side will work. I guess they just aren't made to last very long."
1,Audio only out one earbud,"After two months the sound only comes out of one earbud unless you wiggle the wire the exact correct way and don't move it. Obviously this makes it useless for any sort of portable use. The problem is inside the headphone jack somewhere, though there is no apparent damage to the outside. Seems like several people have had this problem recently."
2,good...while they lasted,"I bought these headphones about 2 months ago, and they were great fit perfectly and sounded great, and then one day one of the earphones just stopped working, so i had to throw them away, so my advice is not to buy them if u want a good pair of headphones that last a long time"
3,"Great sound, comfy, but two pairs have broken within months!","I am so bummed because I bought two pair of these to replace the uncomfortable Ipod earphones for my son and I. They fit very comfortably, the sound was great for casual listeners like us, but we have had problems with one of the earbuds going dead on two pair now. The first pair we contacted the company and they replaced them for free - very good customer service, but now the second pair has done the exact same thing! I guess I should ask them to replace them again, but this is getting tiring. Such a shame because we loved them!"
2,OK while it lasted.,"This was okay for 2 months, until one bud stopped working. Buy something else that actually lasts!"
3,SO SO at best,"These earbuds are the exact same as the Coby CVE92 Isolation Stereo Earphones. same design (identical), same sound, only these have a higher price. Wish I would have just paid to get a higher end nice pair. Save your money in the end these are just so so."
1,Only worked for a few months,"I liked these earbuds a lot when I first got them. They were comfortable and reduced outside noise a noiceable amount (they work a lot like my foam earplugs). However, I noiced that earwax got into the inner workings of the earbud. They don't have a metal shield on the front, like the Sony earbuds. The sound now is very tinny.Frankly, you get what you pay for."
2,"JBuds,",Started shorting out within the first week. The cheapest pair baught elsewhere lasted much longer. Not something I would recommend
2,earbuds,"I don't like the little foam tips on the earbuds, they slide off and what happens when you lose them."
2,Broke and Blew out so easily,"Within two months of buying these, my headphones blew out from too high of noise. Very cheap. The Sony headphones I bought at Walmart have lasted so much longer than any other ones I've gotten. Bad choice."
2,i thought .....,when i bought this item i thought thatthe color will be pink for all the headphonebut when i unboxed itit was only the ears that was pink andthe wire is with white colorover allthe headphone is not that badbut it is very expensive for it's quality
1,Do not buy this product,This was a complete waste of money. Within just a few months the jack would not stay not connected. And now the company is not responding to my contacts to have them honor their warranty. Do not buy this product.
2,Not what i expected.,"The speakers sound OK at best. I tried listening to music, but they distort very easily. Barely any bass and not very loud either"
5,Quality = Price X 10,"I was very skeptical at first because the price was $10 as compared to the $100-1000 that you see on many earphones/headsets. Also, this wasn't the BOSE that you see ads for everywhere, but instead was 'jbuds' which I have never heard of.I tried them on two days ago, and apart from a slight squishing of my ear (you feel the phones after you take them out for a while), the sound quality was awesome. I mainly play them at low volumes, but when I raise the volume, you do get good bass. If you aren't going to be playing lots of music you'll be fine; I love music myself, and this is perfect for me.Sound quality at high volumes: 3/5Sound quality at lower volumes: 5/5Fits ear well: 3/5Cheap: 5/5Sound quality for the price: 5/5This is a great set of earbuds/earphones. I highly recommend that you buy these, especially if you are getting your first pair of earbuds, it's a great starter for you. Later on I might upgrade to something else, but for now, these are great!Go JLabs!!"
5,Great deal,"High quality headphones for cheap. Came with 3 sizes of ""buds"" so I was able to find the right size for me. Doesn't cancel out all noise, but definitely dims it enough where you don't have to blast your music. Very pleased."
4,Great Earbuds!,"They really sound fantastic, I wish the design were better so that they stayed in my ears more firmly when I run. The noise reduction really works (you'll have to take them out of your ears when someone starts talking to you). Just remember its noise REDUCTION and not CANCELING. I got about 3 months of use out of them. But thats how long my earbuds usually work until one of the ears stops working or you need to wiggle the port to get the sound right."
1,Horrible quality,These headphones broke less than a week after I received them. The part of the headphones that plugs into a jack/phone outlet is deteriorated to the point that it does not fit anymore. Very poor quality.
3,Great looking. Okay sound.,I didn't expect too much from these considering the price. Good thing too. They are okay. They look like they would be amazing though don't they? LOL!
3,Medium,Can't believe i wasted my $20 bucks on this when i could've gotten Skullcandy! The cord is way too long! Love the buds comfortness they do fall out. The earpart itself ripped from it connection then the other one busted so im left earphone less! Then i borrowed my bro's apple headphones those sucked too! Getting skullcandies now nd already ahve a pair! MUCH BETTER!
2,A Sad Waste,"When the earbuds worked, they were fantastic. Reduced sound so I could workout or study. But. I haven't even had them for a month, and one bud is already dead. Such a disappointment, considering I bought them off of reviews I read on this sight. Won't make that mistake again."
4,Nice replacement buds,I bought these to replace a worn out set of ear buds. The product comes with three different sizes of foam ear inserts. I had to try all three to find the right size but eventually found the ideal size. Good replacement buds.
3,"Great sound, great price, not sturdy","There was great sound from these very inexpensive headphones, but before a year was up, the cable started getting flaky right around the base. If I didn't have the cable bent just right, the sound in one or both ears would drop out. It's a shame because they sound so much better than the phones that came with my Zune. But I guess at $10 or whatever I paid for it, there's not much I can complain about. Great sound though, and inexpensive."
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought these ear buds 7 months ago and use them daily on my 30 minute commute to work. Within the first month the rubber covering on the ear bud had torn leaving the ear bud exposed to my ear. I have also started experiencing problems with the sound cutting out on one side, okay on the other, then okay when you jiggle the cord. After a week of this, the ear buds have become extremely touchy and only work when I hold the cord in a specific position or twist the cord or they just stop working all together. I checked my I-pod to be sure the problem wasn't with the I-pod and it's clear as day when on a docking station or used with other headphones. Don't waste your money."
1,Worn out very quickly,"I didn't want to spend a lot on earbuds as usually the cord wears out at the MP3 player headphone jack, so these were ok for that. I was dismayed however, when one of the earbuds stopped working all together. I had only had them for a couple months and had not used them as heavily as other earbuds. For me they were not worth the money spent."
3,"Works, but not great","Had a cheap pair of Sony (~$15) earbud-style headphones, but accidentally lost them. Bought this one thinking it'd be just as good, but was disappointed. The earbuds themselves are larger and bulkier than they need to be, and the actual covers on this are made of thicker inflexible silicone, so the earbuds fall out easily. On the bright side the covers don't come off as easily, but they're a pain to push back on if they do come off. The 3.5mm jack also isn't right-angled, which increases wear and tear on the cable. In addition, the design of the wire splitter for left and right earbuds doesn't make sense; I'd have preferred a stationary splitter positioned closer to one ear to prevent the wires from getting in the way or needing to adjust the plastic splitter piece."
1,disappointed,"I have a sansa mp3, which came with an earphone. As I used it a lot, and think it is time to upgrade the earphone. That was why I bought this product that has fair good reviews.Today I got the earphone, and I am quite disappointed. The sound is low, dull and not rich at all. It is very obvious when I compared it with the current earphone. The difference is so big that I even think this earphone has quality issue.Considering its price and painful return policy, it is not worth to send it back. But I have to put it on the shelf only for back up purpose."
5,Excellent,"These are excellent ear buds; they fit well, stay in my ears (even when exercising), cut down on a lot of background noise, are very comfortable, and produce good quality sound. I have nothing but praise for these ear buds."
2,"Good bass, horrible mids and highs","I bought these based on the shear number of positive reviews, unfortunately, the sound quality was far less than stellar. The bass was good, but the mids and highs were muffled, like I was listening under water, the OEM ear buds from Apple that came with my Ipod sound better than these. If you want deep bass then these may be for you, but if you want detail and clean highs then look elsewhere. I'm going to check out the Sennheiser CX300-S Earbuds which Amazon also sells, they are a little more than double the price but if the sound is even half as good they'll be worth it."
3,"Very comfortable, not so sturdy","I bought these earbuds because of the rave reviews about how comfortable they are, and I whole heartedly agree that these are very comfortable to wear. My issue with them is that their cord is thin and cheap, often tying itself up in knots in my bag. The wires inside the cord are equally thin and broke next to the elbow connector after about 6 months of use, rendering the earbuds useless."
4,Very good headphones!,These worked a lot better then I expected! They block outside noise very well and produce a very clear sound. I would consider these headphones better then the ipod ear buds that I replaced with these Jbuds.
2,Not Impressed,I didn't like the feel of these JBuds. They didn't last long either - only 2 months before the sound went out on one side.
2,"Good sound for the price, but won't last.","I rarely write reviews, but I have to speak up about these JBuds. I'll make it brief and to the point.I've ordered 3 pairs and each broke (one side beginning to cut in and out) after 6 months of careful use. The sound quality is surprisingly good considering the low price, and they're comfortable. Based on those reasons, I bought a new pair even after I had two pairs break on me.Unfortunately, my third pair just broke. In each instance it takes about 6 months for this to happen. I've been especially careful with this pair... but I guess the lesson is you pay for what you get.I'll be trying something else this time around."
3,Jack leads separated causing one ear to go out.,"This is a common problem with earbuds with a classic jack connection. After about 4-6 months of daily use, some connection around the jack comes loose and one of the earphones cuts in and out, eventually cutting out completely. This happens with every set of $10-15 earphones I've purchased and these JBuds are no exception. I had them for about 6 months and the right side cut out. I can get it to come on again if I hold the lead at a certain angle with respect to the jack, but it will cut out again and I have to find a new angle. Just to let anyone know. If you use earphones daily get more expensive ones with the hard plastic jack housing."
4,Almost a year and still ticking,"I generally end up miss placing head phones pretty often, so I always have three or four sets laying around the house. Each set has made it through the washing machine once or twice, and these JBuds are still ticking (purchased in Nov 2010). At low volume the sound quality is pretty low, but I'm not an audiophile, so it's not a big deal for me. The build quality is what you'd expect for a 10 dollar pair of headphones, but as I've stated, they've lasted 10 months with pretty heavy use.These are great headphones for the price. If you're an audiophile, look else where, but if you just want some basic headphones to help reduce the noise on a busy bus, train, plane, these are worth the small investment."
4,"Great Product, Despite False Claims","First and foremost, these are NOT noise cancelling headphones. To technically be noise cancelling they would have to have a small microphone on each side to block out noise. This would also mean they'd require their own power source. However...these are great headphones. I bought them because my ear buds that came with my ipod fall out of my ears...irregularly shaped ears I guess. These though are great and perfectly stay in. They also have great bass. Especially considering the price, they are definately worth it."
3,Good enough,The sound in these is fine and it gets the job done. I don't like the fact that they fall out of my ears at the slightest provocation; this occurs with all three bud sizes.
1,Not Really Noise Reducing and Breaks Easily,"These were great for about six months, but they never really reduced much noise. The fit is comfy. My big complaint is that the sound is already gone in one ear."
2,Earbuds failure,"The product arrived in a timely fashion. The sound was good for the price point, BUT, one ear bud has failed within a 4 month time frame. You get what you pay for."
2,Last time I buy jlab,"This is my third pair of JLAB earbuds, and it's going to be the last. I've purchased two pairs of J2s, and one J3 pair. The J2s have better sound balance than the J3s, in my opinion. But none of the JLAB earbuds hold up. The J2s I bought two weeks ago are already kaput; the PC jack simply fell off. The other pairs I purchased had a common problem: within a month, one side went dead.I took care of these J2s. I used them only at home; they weren't getting slammed about in a purse or pocket. I have earbuds, from other manufacturers, which have lasted more than a year.Update: I caved and returned the broken pair for a replacement. The replacement stopped working after one week. The headphone jack is flimsy and falls to pieces almost immediately. It's too bad, because for the price the sound is excellent."
2,My ear canal is too small!,"I know I have a really small ear canal. But I wanted ear insert type headphones for the gym. I decided on these because of the reviews, price, and the fact that they had 3 different sized earpieces. Unfortunately even the smallest size does not fit, the earphones hang precariously outside my ear canal, and that's when I'm sitting still. There's no way they will stay in place when I'm moving <sigh>"
3,Low fidelity,"I think doesn't worth the price, the sound is good if the volume is low, but it you put loud, the sound have a distortion. I don't like it because of that."
4,Perfect everyday headphones for the price!,"Title says it all, these things are well worth the very little money they cost, especially if you tend to go through ear buds as much as I do. Can't comment on how long they will last, but they seem better quality than many other more expensive ear buds I've purchased. I will be recommending these to friends and family!"
1,STILL NOT HEAR YET.,THE REASON I'M GIVING THIS ONE STAR IS BECAUSE IT STILL HASN'T ARRIVED YET AND ITS BEEN ALMOST THREE WEEKS SINCE I ORDERED IT!!!!!
1,Not at all worth it.,"I bought these because no other earphones worked for my dog. She likes to listen to music, but I get really tired of hearing Massenet all day. Honestly, after a while you'd think she would branch out.Anyway, I purchases these thinking, since they're noise canceling, she can listen to this as loud as she wants and it still won't bother me. Plus they're cheap, perfect for a dog, right? WRONG! These are not good at all. They won't even stay in my dog's ears. None of the sizes works right. Even when I can eventually get them to stay in, they seem to bother her because she tries to pull them out. Plus the cord drags all through the mud, and is way to long. No matter where I attach my dog's ipod, the cord still drags. None of the other reviews mention this! We are both very upset with the quality of this product. I don't know what I shall do. I guess I can still try them on my cat..."
5,Great value for the price,"I bought two sets of these to replace the earbuds for my daughters' iPODs - They are far better than the issue Apple Earbuds and far more comfortable. Also, they are durable - The iPOD earbuds were frayed and loose after only a couple of months, while these are still going strongAt $20.00 set, I have already received more than adequate value for the money. If they should ever need replacing, I will be more than pleased to buy a new set"
3,Won't stay in my ears...,"These sound much better than my iPod earbuds, much better... However, the JBuds constantly fall out of my left ear when I run (no matter which size insert I use -- I guess I have a weird left ear). So basically, if they won't stay in my ears when I run, they are useless. Too bad there's not a way to test ear buds before buying. Back to my crappy old iPod earbuds -- at least they don't fall out every 30 seconds."
2,"Comfortable, but poor quality","I bought these as a replacement after I lost one of the silicone tips for my Philips Surround Sound earbuds. I'm not all that picky about sound quality, but the JBuds sound downright awful. I've tried them with my Chocolate and my iPod, I've tried all the different sizes of tips, I've tried tweaking equalizer settings in every way I can think of, and the quality is always very poor. I daresay the buds that came with my iPod sounded better. Also, the amount of cord noise is ridiculous. I really wish I'd just bought another pair of Philips buds. They were cheaper, and the sound quality was ten times better.If comfort is all that concerns you, sure, go for the JBuds. I tend to forget I'm even wearing them. But for $20, I expected more than just comfort and a little bit of noise reduction."
4,Most comfortable earbuds I've tried,"These are much more comfortable than the earbuds that came with my mp3 player, or than any others I've tried. The sound quality is pretty good too. My only problem is that the most comfortable size padding tip sometimes falls out of my ears."
3,Good for the home or office,"The JBuds deliver decent sound quality when walking, sitting, or standing still. The various earpiece sizes help to ensure a comfortable fit.The earpieces are snug enough to wear while running without falling out, but the sound of the cord rubbing against the body comes through louder than the music. The noise is similar to wearing a stethoscope and tapping on the tube."
2,broke after three months,"The sound was great while they lasted, but after three months the left side no longer works."
3,"Noise cancellation is good, sound quality is subpar","The noise cancellation quality is great on these headphones, but the sound quality is not very good at all. It doesn't sound much better than a super cheap brand. The sound is hollow and flat. For the price and review levels I would have expected better quality sound."
4,Love my JBuds!,These little ear buds are inexpensive and work great. And the choice of colors lets you buy a different color for everyone in the house.
4,Nice Buds,"I am on my second pair of buds, my first lasting me about 6 years. Good sound, good fit, and inexpensive."
3,Pretty Good,"Pretty good product. Blocks outside noise, good sound quality. The only reason it did not get four stars is that the line noise is terrible in it. Even when just walking the line noise is unbearable if the cord so much as even touches my shirt, which makes it very difficult to run with."
2,Cheap and chintzy.,"I bought these earphones in March to replace my iPod standards. From the beginning, I was disappointed with the sound quality (very murky and dull, like you've got water in your ears). After 3 months, they are already broken (no sound out of one side/earbud). I was pretty gentle with them, too, only using them around the house and at the gym. Luckily I only paid $20 for them, but I still feel sort of ripped off. Don't waste your money on these if you can afford to pay a little more for better earbuds. I'm giving them two stars only because of the cheap price, which accurately reflects their low quality."
4,Jlabs earbuds,Very good freq. response in the 40-20k range.not bad for the price.i use them as secondary phones to the V-moda' bass freq type.
4,Good Buds,Some good buds for the price nice quatity and there comfey. So if your Looking for a backup or new there good for both
3,Ok headphone,"Headphones work fine (I used the white). When I opened them, they have a strong chemical (or plastic) type smell. One of them made my ear burn when I used it. I purchased the black ones as a gift, hopefully they will be better."
2,annoying,Worse earphone i ever bought.1. Never stays in my ear -.-2. rubber replacements attracts too much dirt.3. simply annoying
1,Disposable & Disappointing,"I enjoyed this product, until I had to throw the headphones away when the plastic ear piece fell off and was lost into some crevase at the gym. The cord on the headphones is alot longer than many headphones, so I also had to wrap the cord around my ipod so it wouldn't get tangled while I exercise. The sound quality is good, the headphones are generally comfortable. The problem with this product is the rubber/plastic ring that holds them in your ear comes off, as mine did after a couple of months. Once that piece is lost, you CANNOT use the headphones any longer because the remaining piece is actually painful to put in your ear without coverage. Most headphone buds I have owned from Sony & Apple have a foam piece for comfort, and once that is lost you can still use the earbuds without. That's not true of these, and as soon as I lost the one piece I had to throw out the entire set of headphones yesterday. I'm not buying these again."
2,best in the market,"One of the best year buds I have ever used. I will strongly recommend this for iPod, kindle, iphone users etc"
2,I-bud,"No issues with the product, issues with company that shipped it. Set was shipped without ear bud protecters. I immediately contacted the company and sent out e-mail addressing concerns. Never got a call back or a response to e-mail. Be wary of the company, customer service is not something that ranks high on their scale."
2,Should've known better,"I had to replace my very awesome Logitech's and decided to try these reasonably priced buds. The sound is passable, but they provide little to no noise reduction. I work in 'cubeville' and don't like to hear my neighbors...I could clearly hear voices and keyboard strokes with the music volume set at a comfortable level. These will be going back... Friend at work loaned me their Tweaked Classic earbuds - incredible sound for 19.95 via tweaked.com. Save your money folks."
5,Amazing for the money,Got these because I had a cross country flight from Seattle Wa to Boston Ma to see my sister and theses looked good. Im very pleased with the quality they reduced a lot of the plane noise and didn't bother my ears for the 6 hour flight. They are also durable I dropped one bud in a glass of water for a couple seconds that I didn't notice and they still work like new. sadly I lost them but I just ordered the Jbuds J3m's and have hi hopes for them. I love this product and would recommend them to everyone.
1,Don't bother buying it.,"My major problem with these ear plugs was that they died within 6 months. There was no warning what so ever; one minute they worked, the next they didn't. My previous earphones lasted 3x as long and they were cheaper than these too!(P.S. Also, they don't reduce noise at all.)"
4,Great for the price,"I bought these a little less than 3 years ago. I used them very lightly off and on for that time; I would say a couple times a month. They are comfortable in my ears, which is the most important thing to me. The noise cancellation is not very good, however I think to get that you have to pay more. My main problems with these headphones are:1. Slides out of my ears when working out2. One of the earphones died on me, and goes off/on depending on the position of the wiring.I gave it four stars since it lasted me 3.5 years of casual use without going out on me."
3,mixed feelings,"i love the color and the length of the wire, but the buds dont really fit my ear properly they end up falling out after a few minutes, and i dont think they are too comfy...but the quality of the sound coming out is good...i guess its different for everyone!"
2,You get what you pay for,"Pay no attention to the overinflated 49 dollar price these buds are worth the 10 dollars you are going to pay for them. Skull Candy puts out a better product in the same catagory. I would not recommend these for motorcyle or activities ie running, walking ..."
2,"Someone paid $49.95 for these, really??!!","I thought I was getting a FANTASTIC deal paying just $9.95 for a pair of ear buds that normally were $49.95, and maybe they are a fantastic deal to other people, but I would've paid more for better sounding ear buds. I have a pair of Skullcandy ear buds that I think are great. I lost one of the bud covers so I was looking around on Amazon for a replacement. I came across this deal and I bought the JBuds. To me, the JBuds are not nearly as clear sounding as my Skullcandy buds. I like that crisp, clear sound to music and the JBuds have a muffled sound to them. Needless to say, I was disappointed but it wasn't worth it to me to send them back. They sit in my bedside table drawer."
2,Good but don't last.,"I have ordered three sets of these headphones and they have all failed because the wire near the jack breaks. The first ones I had I would wrap the cord around my iPhone and therefor thought it was my fault. I ordered a new pair and took extra good care of them but the same thing happened. Other than only lasting about 3 or 4 months with DAILY use they are nice headphones at a great price so I ordered a third pair. The same thing happened again so that's three strikes and I will not order again. I just ordered a pair of the J3's, they cost more but I hope that means they are better made.If you want inexpensive good sounding headphones then order, just remember they will not last long. They are comfy have a nice long cord and really do cut down on outside noise. I could mow the lawn and listen to a podcast without having to turn up the volume real loud."
3,Great - but didn't last,These were great earbuds in terms of sound and usability. My only complaint is that they only lasted about a year before the music began cutting out. I used them for runs (about 2-3 miles 2 or 3 times a week) - so it wasn't really heavy usage.
2,Didn't last long.,"The sound quality? good, Noise cancellation? good. Unfortunately they didn't last much more than two weeks. I hardly got to use them as i only wanted them to use with my laptop as to not disturb everyone else while I was on it at night. Now the left ear bud has gone out and I'm stuck having to buy a new pair."
2,why so many cheaply built ear buds?,"After about 2 1/2 months one of the speakers went out. This seems to happen to me all the time. Why can't anybody build ear buds that last? I am a runner and a bicyclist, so I guess I put them through a bit more abuse than the average, but it gets really frustrating having to constantly buy new ones..."
2,love ear buds but...,"they stopped working about a month after i purchased them... same thing happened with my 'creative' ear buds. first the one side would go out, then the other days later. these things are so frustrating! and its not like i'm rough with them either."
5,incredible sound! <$20!!!,"first off, i bought these headphones thinking that i would just be improving on the headohones that came with my SanDisk Sansa e250 2GB Digital Multimedia Device-SanDisk Sansa e250 2GB Digital Multimedia Deviceand belive me it is not hard to improve on those. I was way wrong.Pros-very comfortable( after a few minutes you will hardly even notice them)-incredible sound for the price-$20-three different bud sizesCons-little too much bass, but was easily fixed by adjusting the equalizer settingsalthough these are NOT noise cancelling headphones, they block out a singificant amount of noise just when you are wearing them. with this music on you can't hear anything else. Best 20 bucks you will ever spend!"
3,"Very good deal, but not without their problems","I like straight to the point reviews, so here's the pros/cons. I have owned these for about 4 months.Pros:-Very good quality sound considering the price.-Very comfortable and stay in well.Cons:-Rubber tips tend to fall off in your pocket (mine got lost so now I need new earbuds).-If you have any earwax it will clog the holes and is difficult to clean.-""L"", ""R"", symbols rub off over time-Brittle wire that freezes, mine broke because of that.Considering the fact that if a tip is lost these are basically useless, and it is difficult to clean (I had to use a staple), I'd steer away from these and pay some more for a higher quality pair. I am not going to buy these again."
2,"disappointing sound, and mediocre comfort level","This is my fourth set of inner ear headphones. I've previously owned the standard Apple (good sound, but let in too much environmental noise), Sony (good sound & very comfortable, but the cord turned to mush w/in 2 months), and a cheap brand whose buds felt like they were made from a old tire. The JBuds' rubber tips are made of a soft and flexible rubber material, but I find the shape and depth unpleasant. They don't block environmental sound as well as the Sony, and, unlike any headphones I've previously owned, the sound is muffled and flat. It's remarkably uncrisp, even for mp3's encoded at 312kbps. Electronica is tinny, classical loses it's richness, and lyrical music and audiobooks sound like they've been encoded at a low bit rate."
3,Just ok,Nothing fancy. They work but they don't cancel out any external noise. Kinda pricey for what you get.
2,unimpressed,"Bought these for my husband and I for Christmas...sent them back ASAP, hardly any sound in the right ear bud, both pair!....even after fidgeting with them a good bit. My husband actually thought his were uncomfortable. I was pretty dissapointed since they had such good reviews!"
3,"Comfortable, Good Sound But...","For the money, these ear buds are quite comfortable, much more so than the ones that came with my iPod. The sound is quite good too but and there is a but, the piece that inserts into the iPod, doesn't fit well and everytime you move, it cuts in and out. That is okay, if you are sitting very still but I like to move around alot when I am listening and that becomes problematic. I don't know if that is because I got one that is defective or if it is a problem for everyone. If it weren't for that one problem it would be a great deal for the money. As it is, it enables me to listen more because of the comfort factor, but I spend alot of time adjusting the connector."
3,so so item,"I got the zen stone plus and wanted better ear buds and the sony font pods that were with my ipod were way better it had higher trebble(sp) and better base (thumping sound) the price is cheap but the pods dont do it just maybe its the zen stone but same songs on the ipod with sony font pods sounded much better. In an attempt to make it sound better the EQ does help but not much. And you turn it up higher trying to make is sound crisper and better, but they are so so review for me..."
5,"Comfortable, great sound, great price - everything earbuds SHOULD be!","The Apple buds that come with the iPod are so uncomfortable, I didn't even want to try any others, thinking they'd all be the same. But when I plugged in my over-the-ear headphones, they looked and felt clunky.The reviews for the JBuds - and the great price - compelled me to give them a try. They are perfect! Very comfortable, great sound, and they look like they were made to go with the iPod. I'm patting myself on the back for this purchase!"
3,"Good quality, low durability","Okay, you probably get about two to four months out of each purchase. It's up to you whether that's worth it or not.The sound quality is good.I don't find them super comfortable, they have to go into your ears to cancel any noise, and there's no way to wear them that doesn't do that. This makes them harder to wear for long periods of time.It doesn't really count towards the quality of the product but the product comes in environmentally friendly containers! No more fighting out death plastic. Just a little bag with everything you need.Re-edited after trying a good bunch."
2,Got what I paid for!,I guess I got what I paid for at this price point. I have a set of ear buds that came free with my laptop and the sound quality of those free ear buds is far superior to this one. I am not sure how quite a few of the reviews are on the higher side.
3,noise reducing not noise cancelling,a little surprising how much other noise you can hear...but then i guess there is a use for earphones that let you hear ambient noise too.
2,Broken on arrival....,"The ear buds are surprisingly comfortable, I was really surprised at their comfort when I first received them. But as soon as I plugged it into my ipod and selected a song, I realized the volume in my right ear bud is lower than my left. So I connected it to my laptop just to make sure it's not my ipod that's acting crazy, and sure enough, same problem occurred.The sound quality sounds pretty good(when hearing with one ear bud..)and they do adquate job of cancelling noises. Much better than the apple ones anyway..Now i'm just waiting for the RMA from JBuds...hopefully I won't receive another broken one..."
2,Expected more...,"These ear buds are ok if your anticipated use is intended for inactive use and if you don't care much about the quality of the sound. They sit very comfortably inside my ears when I sit, lay down and walk. However, they tend to fall out in a middle of light jogging. I have tried them on the airplane and had to crank up my iPod's volume to the max in order to hear the movie that I was watching. So, the noise reduction doesn't work. The bass on these is very weak. I mostly listen to the jazz music and prefer a nice reach sound but JBuds don't provide that. They begin to rattle when you add some extra volume with bass. But I guess you get what you pay for. Overall, I am disappointed."
1,Don't be deceived by pictures,"I am a hard-to-fit customer. My Tragus doesn't fold over like other people to hold in those standard iPod ear buds, so I need something that stays in my ear by friction. Something like foam rubber (or memory foam) or solid soft rubber (like a child's rubber toy). These ear pieces are paper-thin rubber that won't hold its shape and stay in my ear very well if I move my head around. The iPod ear buds fall right out without even moving my head."
2,Good price but bad quality.,"the sound quality really sucks on this, i could pay 5 dollars more and get something that is so much more worth it. will not buy these again."
2,Horrible for Music but great for listening to Speech,"Granted, I got these for less than $10 so I shouldn't have expected booming sound but the 'noise reduction' feature seems to filter out ALL bass! The volume is limited, as well. I've relegated them to my office for use in replaying audio from meetings because they do a nice job of removing extra 'buzz' which makes it easier to focus on voices. I do like the shape of the bud which fits securely and comfortably in my ear. But is that enough to make me buy them again? No."
2,"If you're gonna buy these, buy a spare set....","I had a girlfriend like this in college. 2 really great months and then everything stopped working.I liked the look, feel, and sound of these ear buds. As others have said, good value for the price. After 2 months, the right side had static whenever I wore them, and in less than a week they stopped working all together.I didn't marry that girlfriend in college, thank goodness. I learned my lesson, and I used that knowledge here. I ordered Sennheiser ear buds. They sound great and they have been running fine for over a year now."
4,Good if they fit your ear,"(Good) Good sound, if they are in our ear. (Bad) They are be a bit too quiet, e.g. with an older Ipod. Loud enough with the iPhone (3G), though. They did not go into my older iPhone (2G), but I found none who go, except the original Apple."
2,Nice sound if it would stay in your ear.,"Bought 4 of these for Christmas to upgrade from our current iPod earphones that come with the iPod. Sound wise they sounded fine to me. Noise cancelling...well I compared them to the default iPod earphones and yes they were probably a little better. They probably sounded a little better as well. However, 3 out of 4 of my family do not like them because they keep sliding out of your ear. So, I'm returning them 3 of 4. My son liked them, so kept one set for him. That's my review."
3,"Comfy, but definitely not noise reducing.","These earbuds are comfortable. Nice that they come with three different sizes of the covers. Don't know how they can be called noise reducing though - as another reviewer wrote, I also have noise reducing cotton balls. lolThe one good thing is that if someone is standing next to me, they cannot hear my music. That is a huge thing for me. I ride the train every day and nothing is more annoying than being forced to listen to someone's music secondhand from a bad pair of headphones."
2,Short lived,"I have a Sansa MP3 player and have had a long series of earbuds that last a short while. These were by far the most comfortable. I liked the smallest size ear bud. Sound was good. I listen to audiobooks and music, no complaints. And I was impressed by the miminalistic environmental packaging. But they died after 4 months. First one ear went out then the other. I went to JBuds to apply for the warranty but you have to register in the first month to be able to get the warranty. Too bad. My sister's $5 Coby earbuds have lasted a little longer."
3,JB's could be better,"The sound quality is good for the price; the cord is everywhere and can be hard to unravel; the buds have to be pressed into my ear, and they slip while I'm sitting listening to music or video on my ipod"
3,my favorite headphones..that keep breaking,"These are my favorite pair of headphones. They fit in my small ears perfectly and stay in place even when I ran for 60 minutes. Did not fall out once or even feel like they were going to fall out. Problems: My first pair snapped when I tugged too hard on them. I was very disappointed and immediately ordered a new pair. 6 months later, the left ear bud stopped working. I decided to try another brand and just do not love my new ones the same. They do not fit in my ear and fall out. So I am debating buying these for the third time. Originally, I paid 20 bucks, now at only 12 dollars, I think I am going to try again. We will see if third time is a charm, and hopefully they will last for over 6 months!"
1,Make me sick,"I read a lot of reviews concerning this product and bought one. It's good in reducing noise, but made me sick to my left ear and stopped using it. If anyone has this kind of experience please let others know."
2,Broke after 3 days,"I ordered these, not wanting much, just earbuds that stayed in my ears and an provided acceptable quality sound. Well, at first they were fine, not the most comfortable, but okay. Not the best sound, but passable. However, after 3 days of occasional use with my laptop, the left earbud stopped working unless I wiggled the cord and held it just right. Then it just stopped working completely. I am sending them back."
3,Not good for cycling (IMHO),"I have been using the Sony earbuds for a few years of cycling and thought I'd try something else. So, I decided to try these earbuds.The Good:1 - Sound Quality is Excellent.2 - The Fit is Excellent. Three different sizes.The Bad:1 - When Cycling, the earbuds whistle so loud that they interfere with the sound.Maybe it's just me, but that's the problem I have with them. They are still useful to me for walking, just not cycling. I think the replaceable earpieces are what cause the whistling sound, so, I just thought I'd share this information for anyone interested. YMMV."
2,Worst Headphones for Jogging!!!,"First off for the price the sound from these headphones is quite good. There are plenty of reviews raving about the sound quality of these buds. If you're going to be wearing headphones for stationary activities you'll have no problem enjoying these things. However if you're looking for headphones to wear while your exercising I would stay far away from these guys. I've tried both running and lifting in these buds, and about every 3-5 minutes they pop right outta my ear. I switched up the ear attachments to no avail. The free headphones you get on planes will stay in your ear longer then these guys."
1,I Want My Money Back,"The quality was ok but after a week i saw like a crack with like a burn like mark. After 2 weeks one ear stopped working, then 2 more weeks the whole thing just stopped working. Not to mention it's not very comfortable and don't even think about making someone have a listen(ear wax all over your stuff)THis product sucks."
1,JBuds Hi-fi noise reduce,"The name is not how the plug are. Name sounds good but the actual product is not good. If looking for good sound, would not recommend. Do not waste your time to buy."
3,Just Normal - No Excitement,I do not hear any difference from these Earbuds than any prior ones I have used. I think JBuds are over rated by the manufacturer and other buyers.
2,WOW!! a $2 item for only $6,Too cheap for me.Sound quality is very poor.Probably going to leave these laying around so my kinds can steal them as decoys!
3,its ok but the problem is the headphone dont have mic,the style and color is great. But one thing I dont like is that there is no mic with the headphones.
1,cheap,"not worth buying at all, sound is alright but the wire is like paper. never had them for over a week and they broke."
2,Good sound. Terrible fit.,"These earbuds have excellent sound for their price. A definite upgrade for those people looking to just upgrade their standard earbud. However, these are not noise blocking earbuds because even with three different size buds, one cannot obtain a good enough fit to block out outside noise.Thus, I don't think it is justified for this company to call these buds ""Noise-Reducing"". That is false advertising. These are just an upgrade sound-wise from ordinary earbuds."
2,Disappointed with the sound quality and bass response and they only lasted two weeks,"sound quality and the bass response are terrible. I just picked up a pair of RADIUS ATOMIC BASS earbuds and couldn't be any happier.Radius Atomic Bass - Headphones ( ear-bud ) - blackRadius Atomic Bass - Headphones ( ear-bud ) - silverRadius Atomic Bass - Headphones ( ear-bud ) - blueRadius Atomic Bass - Headphones ( ear-bud ) - maroonThey cost alittle more at $39.99, but are definitley worth all the money. The sound quality is AMAZING and the BASS RESPONSE will blow you away specially if you listen to hip-hop or dance. I have small ears and this is a first time that I have found earbuds that actually fit. Also the construction of these buds is outstanding. They are made out of aluminum and are extremely durable."
3,Noisy,I was a little disappointed in these. They advertise they are noise reducing but offer little reduction in an airplane. I had the volume turned all the way up on my dvd player and it was still difficult to hear. If you are in a quieter environment they are fine but are not great for airplane usage. I will definetly invest a little more for better noise reduction.
4,Good for price,"Not noise cancelling, which I was hoping for, but pretty decent cheap headphones and love the color! They are comfortable in the ear."
5,Nice ear buds,"These Ear buds work well on our smart phones. Have not had any issues with it at all. No static, crackling, or unusual sounds. Very nice & recommend."
4,They Are Ear Buds...,"These are definitely ear buds. They aren't really anything special, I think it was a nice feature that they came with 3 different sized marshmallow type cushions to fit ears from ridiculously small to comically large but I'm happy to report that I came in ""average"" which was the pre-installed cushions.The cable is normal length, probably just enough to reach from your pocket to your ears, I would have liked a slightly longer length but this will do.They came packed in a little pouch along with instructions. I was able to snag these for right under $10 so I feel like it was a good deal, much more than that and it probably wouldn't be worth it."
2,Worked for less than six months,"These were a good value until they quit working. The failure seems to be in the plug - if you pull in out slightly and jiggle it, both earbuds still produce sound. We purchased two different Jlab earbud products in the last year, and neither work anymore."
3,Basic earbuds,"If you're looking for your basic on-the-go earbuds and you're not an audiophile, then perhaps these earbuds are for you. I bought these in May 2011 to replace my 3rd pair of ipod earbuds and my free pair of sound reducing earbuds that worked great in dampening outside noise. I figured the buds on these ones would do a similar job at reducing noise while keeping the crisp sound of the ipod ones. They do reduce some external noise, but not enough to appreciate the lack of sound quality they produce.The mids and highs do not have much clarity in that range. They get the job done but if you're looking to listen to symphonies like Bach G Major these are not your earphones to do that. If you're going to the gym and using them, then these are it. I give it 3 stars in comparison to better/expensive earbuds and 5 stars for typical everyday buds that I can use and not worry about losing or breaking them."
2,"Average earphones, NOT noise cancelling, barely reduces noice","I have to admit this product is at an unbeatable price for earphones but for not much more you can get much better earphones at Target or Walmart. They have Phillips earphones for maybe $15 that work SO much better than these. These claim to cancel or reduce noise but they don't really do that great of a job at it unless you turn the volume way up. Wouldn't recommend this product, buy something else for a few more dollars."
2,Was OK for a while,"When I first got the headphones it wasn't what i expected. They had good quality but they weren't loud enough for me. They did reduce noise around me but, i wanted to be enveloped in my music and the JBuds could not do that for me. They were Ok until they broke on me. Not durable enough for me, i use to wrap the cord around my phone and then wires started to show so i stopped that, but then when i would put the headphones in my jacket pocket as i listened to music it got worse to where now I cannot hear anything out of the ear buds. Good for a month or so then trashed, tried to use warranty, but have yet received the email that they say has been sent to me."
3,They're ok...,"I've had these earphones for about 3 months. They've withstood alot over that time, very durable. These are definitely a step-up from iPod earbuds, however, the sound is quite bland. The highs and mids are great but bass is somewhat lacking. There is bass there, it's just not as wide and filling as I like that you would normally find with other isolation earbuds.These are decent earbuds, but really nothing special. Don't expect them to enhance any music, as it rather excels in making everything sounds moderate."
4,Good bang for the buck,I've been using these earbuds for few weeks now. So far they have served their purpose. Sound quality is some where between average and good. They are comfortable and serve their purpose as my workout earbuds. My only complaint would be that they are not very good noise-reducing headphones.
4,Great Product,These are great work out head phones especially for the price. They are very comfortable and the sound quality is very good.
2,Not worth it,I did not notice any sound cancellation.I thought the sound quality was sub-par compared to the standard iPod ear buds.None of the three ear bud sizes would stay in my ears.
4,Good but not great,"Based on the price, the quality is good. Can't expect it to be as good as $80 ones. I give it 4 star - think it is fair for the price."
2,These tend to get a loose connection and the company does not honor warrenty,"Overall I like these headphones. I've had three sets of them and here is exactly the problem. They keep getting a loose connection. My latest pair failed after only three months so I called the company for warranty service. The guy on the phone said, yea, that's a problem, send us an email with your Amazon order number. I did that and got no response at all. After two weeks I wrote a follow up. Still no response.Time to find another brand of earbuds!"
4,Great for the price.,"For $10, these ear buds are hard to beat. Please note that my review is based on the low price. Decent sound, decent life (mine lasted about 9 months), but not good at isolating outside noise. All in all, great deal."
3,"Nothing wrong with the product itself, it's just not what I expected.","It is what you paid for.If you are looking for noise cancellation, get the real one. This one is just a noise reduction."
3,"Alright for the price, I guess...","PROS:-Affordable price-An easy find-Gets you by if you're going on vacation for a week-Well it's good at noise canceling, there's one thingCONS:-Sound quality is unfortunately weak; most of the songs have a muffled sound to them, which is a personal pet peeve of mine.-The cord is VERY cheap. It was starting to lose the rubber coating after a week.-Also, the rubber tips come off very easily. One time it got stuck in my ear.-Be warned, their replacement policy is a pain too. The second pair I got was just like the previous,Cons aside it's still not bad, but there are worthier buds out there, and I guess this was alright for its price."
2,Breaks easily,I've been through two pairs of these over the past 4-6 months. Eventually I lost hearing in one of the ear pieces both times. Each set lasted about 2-3 of months before breaking down. I would recommend paying up for a decent pair. It's just not worth it to relace every couple months.
2,So good for a little while...,"I bought mine in late July, LOVED them, used them all the time, and then yesterday the right earbud began to crackle and then stopped producing sound altogether. I'm not incredibly surprised, as these were only $20, but I am annoyed. If you want durable headphones, invest in some that cost a little more."
1,IF YOU WANT GOOD SOUND DO NOT BUY THIS,"I bought mine due to some of the 4 and 5 stars reviews. I got mine and i thought, what were these people listening to? This is one of the worst heaphones i've ever owned. Comparing it to my Sony MDR EX71SLA is like comparing a Kia to a Ferrarri. I listen to music a lot, from classical, to classic rock, to oldies, to alternative, to chuck mangione..etc.... I listen to frank sinatra and I listen to Greenday...If you want to waste your money on something...this is it...nothing can beat this earphone for the LEAST you can get for your money."
3,bass-heavy,"Very bass heavy, I had to turn up the treble on the equalizer to get something approximating normal sound. Still a far shout better than stock iPod earbuds, though, and very comfortable in the ear."
5,Solid Headphones,Not the greatest headphones but for the price you cant beat them. No problems to date I've had them for 1 month
2,Cheap ear buds,"I can't say that I notice any noise reducing ability with these, but they are okay for the price. I won't purchase a second pair."
4,Overall a good pair of headphones,"I have gotten these headphones a few times. Very comfortable, and unlike other headphones, the little buds are comfy and don't fall off easily even when shoved in your pocket. Sound quality is surprisingly not bad for how cheap they are, and in my opinion, these are the best headphones to be bought for in the less than $10 range.I will note that durability is not their strength, but their warranty is great and I received new ones always a few days after I submitted my claim."
3,"Good sound, poor construction","This product has surprisingly high sound quality for the price. However, the construction is shoddy. The first pair I ordered had to be replaced, and the second pair broke after about a month of use. For both, the problem was the stereo connection would sometimes flicker. The first pair was unusable, but the second pair, while occasionally annoying, still works fairly well. Indeed, I'm using it now. I would recommend this product to anyone (like me) who wants to save a buck and still get decent quality."
1,"Bummer, They were excellent thr first 30 days and this and the other 5 (under $25.00) I have bought","All either loose sound in one of the sides or they loose about 80% of the sound they had when they were brand new.Again they ROCK new, after 30 days you want to hang someone with the cords. JJ. I am actually worried that this may be the case with all headsets. It has be a little fearful of buying a more expensive set and have the same problem. I have purchased 6 different types of these all under 25 and they all have the same problems as I have stated above."
4,Perfect for average user,"I'm not one of those people who can tell the difference between good sounding earbuds and those over $[...].These fit my ears perfectly and that was number one choice. The standard earbuds from Apple are crap, fall out all the time. These sound good to me and they fit perfectly and do not fall out.Price was right, delivered in 2 days using free delivery."
2,okay for the price,not too excited with sound quality and fit but i guess for the price it does the job. seems durable
4,Good sounding buds...no clip to stop them from getting tangled though,The buds sound great for less than $10. The only problem I have is that there is no clip to prevent the buds from tangling. Did not have to use customer service so I can't really speak to that.
4,Vinny W's,"I like the fitand the sound is great for the price I paid. I would suggest anyone wanting this kind of ""in-ear"" type ear buds to buy these. These JBuds are the shizznit!"
2,Call me spoiled!,"I was not impressed with these buds. They just don't ""sound"" good. They feel o.k., but the sound is not ""o.k."".I think I'm spoiled with the quality and the sound of the Philips ""surround sound"" I think...Philips SHE5910 Virtual Surround Sound In Ear HeadphonesThey're the best...I like them 100x better than the $100 Bose in ear buds too; but not as much as the ""Shure in ear""...but they'll set you back at least $250.So, my vote is, don't waste your time or money on these buds... go for the Philips VSIEH."
2,works good when working,These work good...didn't hurt my ears like the other kinds. But it started acting up after a few months. Bummer...
2,Just plain bad sound.,"I'm giving these a ""two"" because of one feature: they fit in my ears better than most buds, and stay in during exercise better than most.I bought a pair of these a while back; they performed well enough. Not great, but I'd have given them a three, maybe even a four.I lost 'em.Now, I've bought three new pairs, as part of package deal with MP3 players (Sansas ... which we like a lot) and they're awful.The sound is simply muddy. Not exactly ""bassy;"" that would entail some degree of defined bass sound. No, these are simply muffled sounding. It's like listening to music (or even audio books) through a pillow.Not worth the twenty bucks and at the list price - well, that's outright theft."
4,I like these.,"I like these ear buds...better sounds than Apple's. The only problem is when I use these for jogging, I completely cannot hear anything around me. The bike riders get upset trying to warn you they need to pass."
1,Heed the low ratings!,"I really wish I had listened to the minority of reviewers who gave these earbuds bad reviews. But I took a chance, and I got burned.I owned these for less than a month. The sound quality was more than adequate for what I was looking for (and for what I paid), as well as a notable improvement over my ipod buds. However, today the right earphone suddenly stopped working. I can get the sound back if I wiggle the cord just right, but the sweet spot for that is getting more and more difficult to hit.In the few weeks I've owned them, I've been quite careful with them. They're wrapped up nicely and kept in a case when I'm not using them, and I don't even wear them when exercising. This short lifespan is a major disappointment. Don't make the same mistake I did. Pick a different pair of earbuds."
1,Broke before we cold use them,Bought these for my 7 yr old. The rubber things don't stay on the ear pods. They came off right out of the package and every time we tried to put them pack on they would just pop right off again. The entire product feels and looks cheap. Not worth your time or money! Sadly another land fill item.
3,"Good enough for the price, sound quality could be better","I bought this thinking on having a cheap, fitting pair of earbuds, and in that sense they work well.Came with various size soft silicon ear buds although I didn't need to try the other sizes.Can't give them 4 stars because I was dissappointed with the sound. I know they cost 6 bucks, but I have older, cheaper, not fitting in-ear headphones that sound a bit better.But you get what you paid for, and I love the fact that they reduce ambient noise, so I don't have to up the volume so much.So, good enough for $6."
5,Booom!!,"The tip of these headphones is the old school (regualr) round one, so you would have to buy the little (inexpensive) converter that you can attach to it and place it in the square plug(s) of your phone..."
4,Great for the price,"For cheap earbuds these are fantastic. Good sound, fit well and are pretty durable. I ordered multiple pairs and have been very pleased with them. Audiophiles might not like them but for most people these are great."
4,Great for price.,Can't beat the price. Works great when I want to listen to the computer while others are watching TV. Would recommend this product. Received when they said it would be delivered.
1,"Good sound, horrible durability.","I like the sound for these headphones, very good bass and treble, but the durability of the headphones were completely PATHETIC! They didn't even last me 1 day!! And I barely used them! The sound is great but the durability is absolutely pitiful. They both stopped working in a matter of 10 hours, at least."
1,Not for Active Use,"Purchased one set and liked it until it went dead within a couple weeks of daily mobile use (commuting, walking) with no visible, outward sign of damage. Amazon promptly replaced for free, but now the left and right buds in the the replacement set are cutting in and out after a few weeks of use, again without any external, visible sign of damage. There were no notable incidents (drops, etc). The problem in the replacement set seems to be in the connection to the ipod since wiggling it appears to affect whether sound is present in either or both buds.Another pair that is only used only occasionally and typically at home still works great after a few months.Bottom line is that this product does not appear up to withstanding normal wear and tear from active, mobile uses."
4,Great for the price,Crazy good for the small price. Use these every day without issue. A little bit concerned about the plastic noise-reducing parts.
3,Ear buds,"I got these to listen to while riding a motorcycle. For that purpose they didn't cut it. They stick out from my ears a little so when I put my helmet on they popped out. They block sound fairly well, but don't play music very loud."
5,Great little buds,"I have actually purchased several pairs since last fall,all of which are still functioning well. The sound,(assuminga proper fit) is quite full and well balanced/natural.After trying several other brands, I still keep coming back tothese to hear how the original ""track"" was mastered. Many other budsare bass-heavy, or very bright. These provide some isolation,without being totally disconnected from your environment."
1,Complete fizzle of right ear bud after two weeks of use.,"I came across these to replace some cheap earbuds I got from the grocery store. I found these and was pleased with the price and the good reviews. I read some of the bad reviews, and noticed a lot were about this very problem. I thought to myself, ""Oh, they probably weren't being handled well"". That was definitely not the issue. The fizzle happened while I was on a trip, while the earbuds were in my ear. This was very upsetting. I found I could get the sound back for a while if I bent the cord a certain way, but it would simply go out again. They have great sound and fair noise cancelling while they are working. The problem is they don't last long. These are not worth the fifteen dollars I paid for them."
4,sound good,"although they sound good, i don't feel they are different from others, and don't feel the noise reduction, the cord started getting rigid and is about to break"
3,Decent Ear Buds,The sound on these is pretty decent. You can listen to and enjoy them at a relatively low volume. I prefer the smaller ear bud cover but there was only one! They do feel pretty flimsy so I'm trying to take care not to yank the cord which is pretty short. It's not short if you're just connecting it to your iPod on your belt or wherever but I use them at my desk at work and they don't reach all the way to the end of the desk. For $20 I think it's a good deal. I'll prob. buy another pair when they break.
5,Excellent performance,"Nice addition to my laptop. Great sound, comfortable. Very tough in that it takes some punishment. I am very happy with this purchase."
3,You get what you pay for...,"They are inexpensive, and comfortable, but audio quality is poor. I am still using them, as you get use to the bass-y sound they produce, but I am looking for another everyday pair. These are a great backup, and get the job done in a pinch."
4,Good for Cheap Price,"If you aren't the type of person to spend a lot of money on headphones, but just want a nice pair of buds so you can go about your daily life, these are great for you. The quality of sound is very good, and it does surround so that everything else is blocked out. I use them when I go to the gym and other things, and they work great.The buds themselves seem a little flimsy (made of flimsy material) and I always worry about tearing them, but maybe you can get a case for that."
2,works great for 2 months,you think this product is great cuz of the 4 stars. dont fall into the trap like i did. i bought it thinking well its cheap and lotsa ppl like it. its been 2 months since i got it and the right ear bud just stopped working. if i move the wire around theres static. dont waste ur dough. get something >$30
3,Don't Believe the Hype,"When I brought this headphones for over $10, I thought I was getting my money's worth. At first the headphones was amazing. The sound was clear and the fit was comfortable but after two months, I lost hearing in one ear. I was so shock. These headphones were suppose to last for atleast six months. It was like regular heaphones. There is no difference. I recommend you get your five dollars headphone instead of paying alot for the same quality. I am very dissappointed. I am never going to trust pitches for headphones."
5,Excellent sound for a low price,"Very good fit, very good sound for a small headphones and incredible price, almost 100% noise reduction with a little high volume. For this price the product is excellent."
