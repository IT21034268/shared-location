5,David Gilmour: Remember That Night,"Outstanding DVD with amazing audio and video quality. The light show itself deserves the highest ratings. I was introduced to this performance by a link to YouTube and decided the entire program needed to be seen. I found the DVD on Amazon with the only copy available in Australia. Unfortunately after ordering and receiving I found out that there are different codings for regions of the world. I could not get the DVD to play on my DVD player even though it would play on my laptop. The Australian company, Hear and Now Entertainment, was kind enough to allow me to return the DVD and refunded the purchase price, shipping and handling. A big thanks to Hear and Now for their customer service. Now my search begins for a replacement that will function properly in my DVD player since I can't imagine not having this program in my collection."
2,Hello the voice is gone,This one of the Blu-rays I gave away as a gift and although the receiver enjoyed parts of it they noted Gilmour has lost it in his voice with regards to power.Not a good purchase!
3,Not what I expected from Gilmore,Low quality picture and sound. Thought Gilmore would do better. Yes at Montrose is the one to get.
2,Disappointed,"I am and will always be a huge fan of David Gilmour and his work; that's why I gave this title 2 stars. The performance of ""Echoes"" was stellar. David Bowie in ""Arnold Layne"" was brilliant.Not so good: First, the video quality is horrible at points. Not a videophile but it is really bad. Second, David's execution is lacking at some points, almost like, ""lets just get through this one so I can go back to the hotel"". And lastly, David Bowie singing in ""Comfortably Numb"" was just downright painful.Skip this title and wait for Gdansk to come out on Blue-Ray."
3,not so good,"Well, the songs of course.. are fine, the quality of the video and the music recording are NOT SO GOOD. It was a real dissapointment for me. If you watching this on a 25"" TV with 4:3 ratio and a mono speaker... then you might like it. But, if you are in it for the HD visual and 5.1 or 7.1 experience... look elswhere."
3,Audio dropouts taint a beautiful performance,"This three-star review is referencing the DVD reproduction of this concert, which is the product being purchased here. The concert performance is amazing, the DVD version of it is flawed.Maybe my ears are bit more sensitive to sonic anomalies, however I was very disappointed to be continually distracted by sudden drops in audio level. Other owners of this DVD have mentioned noticing the same drops in amplitude. I can't be sure whether the drops occurred in tracking, mixing or mastering (let's hope not). The bands performance, quite easily, overcomes these technical shortcomings. However, I cannot believe that quality control would not have caught this prior to release."
5,The Consummate Entertainer,"David Gilmore is an excellent guitarist that does not rely on flashy playing to get his message across to the audiences that he plays for. David has his own immediatly recognizable playing style, that is often imitated by others. You could always recognize his immense influence on all of the Pink Floyd Records, from ""The Dark Side of the Moon"", to the very latest albums.This DVD is very valuble to me, because it shows David as a very down to earth performer, whom is always interested in releasing only the best product that is possible. This DVD has Pink Floyd songs,and songs from all of David's excellent solo albums, especially from ""On An Island"".You can't go wrong with this DVD if you want to see what life is like on tour now days. It is nice to see that David now takes his family on tour with him. Gone are the days of the wild parties, and groupies."
5,They Should All Be This Good,"This is a superb DVD, and a template for how to make them right! If you choose Tracks on Disk One, you get a window splitting the songs into the 10 from ""On An Island"" and the 13 from other sources, including, of course, your Pink Floyd favorites. Disk Two also offers an option to select just the music tracks, and despite a few that are weak in the beginning of the list, again you have great music easily accessible! There are also other elements available, from documentaries to videos, and it's all good. The music is excellent throughout, with good showmanship, as we've come to expect from Pink Floyd, and, basically, you just can't go wrong with this one!"
5,50% of Floyd is 100% great!,"Another reviewer mentioned that having Echoes here was worth the price of the DVD alone. I would agree, and add that having Wots..Uh the Deal also makes this worth the bucks. Too many of these songs he has done before ad infinitum (do we really need another take on Coming Back to Life or High Hopes??), but having this great track from my favorite Floyd album ""Obscured By Clouds"", is just great! Since that album is probably their least known (and certainly most underrated, in my book), it may serve to convince people to go back and see where this beautiful song came from. Other than that, great picture and sound, and a ton of extras (not to mention what must be 3 1/2 hours of music), makes this one a must-have! And I only paid $11.99!!!"
3,"Grainy, pixelated BluRay Disappointment","I love David Gilmour and all that he brought to Pink Floyd. His solo work is stellar. The fact that this great performance and line up of guests is thwarted by a poor video source/capture/transfer is a real disappointment on BluRay. The grainy look on the distant camera angles is distracting when run through PS3>HDMI>Sony XBR4 LCDtv(true 1080p/120hz). Even the 'on stage' close ups lack the vivid feel you expect with high definition. If you have seen the Cream 2005 HD DVD shot at the Royal Albert Hall, you know a true high definition concert experience. The video is pristine. This Gilmour compilation has stupendous audio quality, but it just does not make up for the non-hi def looking vid."
3,"""Remastered in High Definition""","That's what it says on the back of the box, instead of giving actual video specs. Watch the concert for about 10 seconds and you'll realize why: there's no way this was filmed in 1080i or 1080p. This is a mediocre looking concert ""remastered in high definition.""On the plus side, The concert itself is great and the audio is fine. Disc 2 has a bevy of extra songs and footage from the tour. But the regular DVD is cheaper and can't look worse than this."
5,David Gilmour-Live at Royal Albert Hall,I saw this video at a party and enjoyed it so much I purchased it the next morning. I have loaned it to a few friends and everyone loves it. It is great !!!
5,The best show performed by David G. as a single,This is the most representative material of the work as a single of David Guilmour. It's a collectoin jewel. If youare a fan you must have this itme.
5,David Gilmour - Remember That Night,"After seeing this and recording on the DVR off HDNet, was pleased to get the full concert. Only complaint was that unlike the DVR of HDNet, the color saturation was terrible on the BRDVD requiring me to go in a reset all the color settings in order to view it with out all of the saturation."
4,David Gilmour - Remember That Night DVD,"Great audio and video. Bought the Blu-Ray for myself, and bought another copy as a gift for a close friend."
2,Average,"Sound is really good, but the overall footage and music is not worth the purchase. I was expecting a lot more."
3,I need more informations about it!,"I think I'm not able to rate this item yet, because I've never saw it and there's no sufficient informations about it. For example: what kind of audio they put in this DVD? DD, DTS, PCM?I'd like to know."
1,Zone1 instead of zone2,"hello,I received a DVD ""Remember that night"" in the format zone1,but I live in Belgium (Europe, zone2).It means that I cannot watch this DVD. I have lost 23.99 US dollars for this.What can you do for me Mister Amazon.com without paying additionalpost fees ;-)Paul HERMAN"
1,Phoenix_Guy_85008,"If it's Roger Waters or David Gilmour ...It all sounds the same , nothing new on this 2-set DVD other than special Guset...Grosby & Nash and then David Bowie.....at the end on 2 songs..I say it was a waste on money $$$$as nothing can replace the group ""Pink Floyd"" with all four of the original member... Don't get me wrong I like David Gilmour ...But all he does is have special guest and try to sound like it's ""Pink Floyd"" And it is NOT.........................."
5,Outstanding audio recording,"David Gilmour at his best. If you have a decent surround sound system and like Pink Floyd, settle down with your favorite refreshment and turn the volume up as loud as you dare. This blu-ray shows Gilmour's perfectionist attitude about mixing and recording to your advantage.Wow! Wish you were here, indeed.Easy rider"
5,show off your system,"want to show off your HD system, got new speakers, this is one of the best.sound and video are top notch."
3,i do rememba...but...,"David Gilmour needs to get off his fat, lazy arse and make some new music!! Cmon Gilmour, you complacent, fat garlic eating bastard!! lol"
2,Flawed recording,"First of all I am huge Pink Floyd fan and saw Pink without Roger twice and they were great shows.This DVD, part one, is flawed in recording or playback. Can easily be heard in the first song. The volume goes down! Horrible! Then other songs do the same. Ruins the song, of course. Disc two sounds much better."
1,Junk!,"As a great BluRay Concerts Collector (more than 80), and a big fan of all time of David Gilmour and Pink Floyd, can tell you this is a piece of junk just because of the picture and sound quality. Dont bother yourself buying this....instead get the DVD one, less expensive and the same quality. Its a shame this great concert was not filmed on high quality for a true BluRay presentation.Please, guys, dont do this again. Huge fans do not deserve this.Take a look to the recently released ""Lady Gaga at Madison NY BluRay Concert""....then you'll see what i'm talking about in terms of stunning picture and sound a BluRay should perform!!"
4,"Very good, but....","I'm a huge Gilmour fan and enjoyed this Royal Albert Hall concert video, but soooo wish he would have included some of his older solo numbers. That being said, buy it. You won't regret it. I've never regretted watching an artist with this much talent present their creations to grateful fans. The bonus material was interesting, but would have preferred more songs instead. I only hope we get to hear more from Gilmour in the years ahead."
2,Incomplete order,"Waiting for resolution on this purchase. I was sent two copies of disc # 2. I've made two appeals to the seller with no response. So far, not so good."
2,Not Such a Night to Remember,"David Gilmour opens up with four of his "" Classic"" Pink Floyd songs which is Great. But then he plays his ""New Stuff"" which I can take or leave mostly leave. Sprinkles in some more classics to keep me interested and watching the full DVD. I had hopes when I bought this DVD that Gilmour would play the songs he is noted for but was mildly disappointed, it's the least of my viewed DVD'S not happy I bought it."
1,Disappointment,"I know this DVD is great having been an owner before my son purloined it. The replacement from Amazon was useless as it only works in Region 1 countries, if you guys want to compete internationally in digital entertainment you need to realize there is a world outside the USA. A fundamental flaw in your operation is sending non complying product to the international market. Time to think outside the square chaps."
1,WARNING!,"I would love to review this product. I would love to be able to SEE this product! I purchased a region A/1 Blu-ray Disc for Australia, which is not Region A/1. As I can watch region 1 DVD's on my Blu-ray player, I thought that the same would apply to a BD. Let this be a warning to all others. It seems that this BD was only released for US/Canada use, so I am stuck with a Disc that I would dearly love to watch but can't."
2,lots of no harmony,gilmor is obviously in his low element. he likes his solos but the harmony with crosby and nash just isnt there. all you floyd fans are blinded by gilmor. im also a fan but this one is a disapointment for me. maybe he should ask roger how to create the right sound.
4,Entertaining & informative,"This book is pefect for the 'Cliff Clavins' of the world. Its colorful cover and detailed photographs draw you in to read about some of the world's most bizzare facts, feats, people and animals. If your thing is outlandish trivia and oddities (albeit some of which are disturbing and not for the fainhearted), this is the book for you!"
5,Great Video,"""Get Ready for Pilates"" is a great video for those who have not exercised in a while or just want to learn pilates.Kathi's instruction has an easy flow to it without feeling rushed. She also includes modifications of the exercises to fit what is ""right for your body"". We recommend it and Kathi for every beginner!"
5,Remarkable Results!,"I have read a ton of interior design books, and for the most part, I kept thinking I would learn through osmosis, by looking at the beautiful pictures and hoping for inspiration. Unfortunately, my home did not reflect my love of interior design, which for me, is the ultimate test of effectiveness.This book takes Lauri Ward's ""Use What You Have Decorating"" book, which had some good ideas, and goes much further in showing you in each photo how you can arrange your furniture and accessories into a beautiful home. It tells you the basic rules, how to balance items visually, and why these tips work. Since I bought the book, I've been moving my furniture and rearranging my tabletops and I am amazed at how beautiful the results are. I'm ready to toss all of my old decorating books, and just leave this book on my shelf. I am surprised at how well this book has worked for me."
4,Cute Polish cartoon about a young muskrat named Seraphin,"Wicker Bay's Secrets (Tajemnice Wiklinowej Zatoki) is a cute Polish cartoon about a young muskrat named Seraphin. After saying goodbye to his parents, Seraphin starts living on his own. He meets new friends and learns many things, including that he should follow his parents advice. The cartoon is entertaining, and I even found a few parts to be very funny.This DVD is 73 minutes long. It is in Polish and there are no subtitles. This cartoon makes a great tool for language training."
4,muy bueno,Este es un libro muy recomendable pero tambien recomiendo especailemente el libro El sueno del amor.
5,ESTE LIBRO PUEDE SALVAR TU MATRIMONIO.,ESTE LIBRO ES DE GRAN AYUDA PARA APRENDER A AMAR Y SER AMADO EN EL MATRIMONIO Y EN LA FAMILIA ES UNA RECOPILACION DE EXPERIENCIAS DE MATRIMONIOS AL BORDE DE UN DIVORCIO O CON PROBLEMAS POR IGNORAR LOS CONOCIMIENTOS QUE NOS ENSENA ESTE HERMOSO LIBRO TE ASEGURO QUE SI LO LLEVAS A CABO TU MATRIMONIO SERA MAS RICO Y LLENO DE AMOR.
5,6 Tricks to Student Story Writing Success,"Even though he's a good student otherwise, my 11-year-old son hated to write. He was easily frustrated and overwhelmed by his writing assignments at school. Enter: 6 Tricks to Student Story Writing Success. My son and I read the book together in an afternoon, savoring every page. The illustrations were fun and compelling; the ideas embodied in the book were fresh and novel. The easy-to-read primer taught even this ""old dog"" new tricks to story writing, and my son couldn't wait for his next writing assignment to try out all he'd learned. When that time came, he approached his work with the enthusiasm and confidence of a skilled writer. We can't wait for the next ""6 Tricks"" book to come out!"
4,A good little helper.,"The game hauler is pretty good for the money you pay. A steel frame is not exactly light weight but pretty solid. The only thing that I didn't like was that this cart is not foldable. By that I mean that you assemble it with nuts and bolts provided, but you can't just fold it in seconds and put it in your trunk or etc. when you need it, it requires disassembly with tools. I would give it a 4 star rating."
1,better put this one WAY up high!,"The appearance of this sconce is very cheap - it actually looks like a piece of hand painted high school play scenery, and the finish in no way resembles either wood or metal."
1,Disappointed for two years...,"I tried to like this vacuum. But in the end, I have nothing good to say about it. Suction was never good enough, spat dirt out the back on non-carpeted areas, hd to replace a part a year in that was melted and burning. Now a year later it is smoking again. This time I'm done. I used my friends dyson the other day and couldn't believe what a real vacuum can really suck up!"
1,I had to return this vacuum cleaner and the replacement,"The vacuum cleaner I ordered picked up the dirt and spit it back out. Amazon gave me no trouble at all in getting a replacement and returning the defective one. Unfortunately, the replacement had the same broken part that the original did. Very disappointing, especially since it was supposed to be a commercial model."
1,SHOCKED ME! (not in a good way!),I just got this vacuum today and when I tried to use it I kept getting a shock through the handle! I called Eureka and they are making me take it to a service location 20 miles away! (And I live in a city with 2 vacuum repair locations!) NOT a happy customer!!!! This is being returned to Amazon (thanks Amazon). No more Eureka for me.
2,Too Bad!,"Too bad, I wish I could still return this thing. All of the good points about this machine is out the window because it's like pushing a Buick around the house."
1,Not a commercial vacuum,"This item was purchased Dec 2010, it was out of commission by the new year. After warranty service it still does not work properly. We have usually had no problem with Eureka vacuums, but at half the cost stay with a Eureka Boss non commercialgrade. The floor release switch does not work properly and the overall vacuuming efficiency is poor. It is mostly plastic, relatively heavy and poorly designed."
5,Meyers is King !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am a diehard lifelong Elvis fan and this is the ONLY movie on Elvis ever made that is outstanding. Meyers is perfect, without going over the top or looking like an imitator. Other movies had Elvis with his jumpsuit on at Graceland, overdoing the accent, sunglasses on everywhere, ect. (and that includes Kurt Russell who was WAY overrated in his portrayal). The rest of the cast is also outstanding, as well as the script and using the King's real music ! The story line for the most part was very accurate and focused on important things no other movie has. Kudos to Quaids performance of Colonel Tom. I can't believe it took so long to release this on DVD. My only question now would be...can Myers & Co. do a sequel to finish the rest of his life ????!!!!"
2,"Stick with the Michael St. Gerard version, or the REAL THING...","This movie had good production value, but really didn't suck you into the period at all. The acting is very stiff, and Jason Rhys Myers sounds like he's reading the script. There are performances here that are so bad you wonder how the person got the part. The girl playing Pricillia is like watching a high school play. If you want to see a GREAT Elvis TV movie find the Michael St Gerard version from 1990. That is how it should be done."
1,Over Rated and Over Awarded,"I have been a victim of this mini sieres of ""ELVIS"" on behalf of my loving wife due to the "" Jonathan whatever "" . I have been brought up withElvis and know his entire legacy from top to bottom. Elvis, did abuse of nonsubscribedpills but has never been known in his past legacy and documentaries or personall friend interviewsas the person he is being portraid by this actor. This has been the (WORST) film of Elvis ever made.I recommend for anyone intersted in the REAL STORY to see "" THIS IS ELVIS "" the film.Elvis,is and ever will ever be the KING."
3,Just ok,I received my order with no problems. The mini series just wasn't what I had expected. I wanted to see more of Elvis and his life but this mostly showed him on the movie set with Ann Margaret.
5,Far cheaper on WB website 19.95,I was looking and noticed that all of the new Joan Crawford releases sold on Amazon are being sold by 3rd party vendors. You can purchase the same DVD through Warner Brothers for 19.95 a savings of over $20 from what these 3rd party sellers are asking for in price. Visit the following link to visit WB Archive collection:http://www.wbshop.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-WB-Site/default/Search-Show?q=joan%20crawford&sz;=43
2,boring,"I'm a big Joan Crawford fan and a fan of old B&W movies....but this one is just kinda boring. Did see the Last of Mrs. Cheney, though and that was very good. Joan really sparkled in the latter."
5,"Entertaining,lovely,and carefree.","I found this movie quite lovely.However, if your looking for a drama ridden, heart wrencher don't bother with this one. Love on the Run goes by the usual MGM formula outline. Beautiful ladies ( Joan Crawford), handsome men (Clark Gable & the former ""Mr. Crawford"" Franchot Tone), a dilemma, a joyous resolution. And finally, Love. One word sums it up, CUTE!"
2,Keep on Running,"Part of the seven or so films made by this chemistry-laden pair, ""Love on the Run"" is nothing much to write home about. Gable sports a stupid hat at one point; that's about it. See ""Possessed"" instead."
1,Don't even bother buying this,"Just looking at the sample pages are enough to tell you not to bother buying this book. She actually got his NAME wrong! His name is Colin James Farrell, not Colin Andrew Farrell.If a writer can't get the subject's name right, how can you trust the rest of the book?"
3,"Smells good, but dry","I agree with Shortie. These wipes smell good but they are thin and difficult to tear. The first wipe that has been sitting on top is usually dry if you haven't used it in a few days. I got them on sale and thought they were still not worth the money. Can't imagine paying full price for them. Try pampers aloe baby wipes instead. They don't smell as nice, but the big box will only cost you $1-2. If you are looking for a pet-specific brand, I've heard Earthbath makes good wipes but have not personally tried them yet."
2,"DRY, THIN WIPES","For the price I was expecting a much better quality product. The wipes are very, very thin and dry. Usually wipes have liquid in the tub to keep it moist, but this did not. As a result I have to use more than two wipes to clean my dog. The only good thing about it is that it smells good."
5,Good Cable,"It's a good cable. Which my tv had HDMI, or 1080p for that matter. But works great for my current component (HD) setup"
1,AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE,"In the span of less than 60 minutes, this device drove me to drink.It will work with a Mac, this is true. I got it to print. Once. But you need a Windows machine to actually set it up, which my wife has just feet away from my Macs. So we ran the software that came with it ... and it cooked XP.So I called tech support. After 26 minutes and three transfers to different support reps, two of whom spoke a variation of English that is not compatible with mine, where all I wanted to know was, ""DOES THIS WORK WITH A MAC?"" I was told, no. EVEN AFTER I GOT IT TO WORK!I gave up at that point ... I'm just going to get a longer USB cable for my printer and use the share printer option on one of my Macs. If we can ever resurrect the XP box, that is ..."
2,1 out of 3 works,"Bought 3 for the company.The 1st one works great w/ HP DJ 9800.The 2nd one didn't.It sees the printer, Canon D861, but nothing was printed.Netgear said that it wasn't compatible w/ the printer.The 3rd one printed only once on HP Color Laserjet 4550.Now the supplied admin program does not see both 2nd & 3rd.Overall intallation should be simpler.The factory default static IP 192.168.0.150 is wrong choice.No reset button.Unplugging the cord will rest the unit to the factory default.It means that you have to set it again on every power interruption.A never-heard-concept in IT industry!!I expect more professional solution from Netgear."
2,Works great until it breaks,"I gave up after my second one stopped working. Terrible customer support - It's been outsourced to India and they don't speak english well. Also, they charge to replace defective units and getting replacements is a hassle. Low quality product."
4,Works with SCO Unix,"I've got about 10 print servers on our Unix network and 3 of them are these little boxes. I've had no problems using them with laser printers, dot matrix and barcode printers."
5,Great for the price if you know LAN basics,"I bought three of these little dongles to let me put my existing HP laser and deskjet printers on my Linksys router LAN for all to use. This lets everyone who connects to my wireless LAN use any of the printers, with no dedicated print server computer. I did not use any of the Netgear setup utilities provided on the CD, I set it up manually using the web browser interface. Read the Amazon review from ""Ones and Zeros"" for this product. His (or her) updated section offers some good advice for Windows XP users."
4,Product Better than Documentation,"Once working, works well. It wasn't obvious to me that accessing the PS101 from a wireless laptop thru a Netgear MR814 required turning off Microsoft's firewall. Wasn't obvious to their tech support either. Observed only minimal degradation in print speed."
1,Problematic w/ Minolta 1250W; poor customer support,"I bought this print server for a Minolta PagePro 1250W, and couldn't get it to work. I called their tech support, and their ""level 1"" support in India wasted about an hour of my time before saying it wasn't compatible. Their website never mentioned this incompatibility, just that it was compatible w/ ""most popular printers."" When I complained, I waited anther 1/2 hr for their ""level 2"" support in the US. They got it to work, but it's extremely slow (I tried 3 different PC's, on both wired and wireless), and sometimes has to re-installed for no reason. This is the first and last Netgear product I'll buy..."
5,Excellent product,"I was sick of swapping printers depending on my print needs at the moment. I was also not interested in a 'switch box' that either required manual flipping of the switch or paying much more for automated directing of your print job.For one thing, I wanted my extra printer (Laserjet 5L) to stay where it was -- on the extra desk, which is not within reach of a standard printer cable to the computer. Why couldn't I take advantage of the home network (Windows XP SP2) I'd installed which had a router box near the extra printer?So, I started my search for an affordable solution and found the Netgear PS101. Reviews led me to believe that setup could be touchy, but for the price, I decided to give it a try.Well, it's worked out great. Setup turned out to be not that difficult. I now have a seemless connection to the second printer from all 4 computers on the network. Works great! (Be sure to shop around a little, as I think the price varies greatly on this product.)"
2,Easy but ports wear out too quickly.,"I work at a company that has had a many as 10 of these installed at once. The problems were few at first, but over time you had to turn it off and back on to get it to start printing. Eventually, the ethernet port seemed to wear out. You had to ""jiggle"" the cat-5 cord to get the link light to turn on. The software is great, but the device itself is poor quality. We have begun phasing these PS101's out at our company and only have 2 left."
4,Good value,"The print server was very easy to set up, using the CD provided. No special training is necessary. Just follow the simple instructions. We bought it because the network card for our 2 year old HP laser printer failed. A replacement was about (...), which is ridiculous. This product does the same thing for much less. The response time from when you click-to-print until the printer actually responds is slower, but only a matter of a few seconds. Our small office has a peer-to-peer network with everything going through a switch."
4,Network Printing Heaven,"I wanted to use an up to date wireless print server, i.e. Dlink DPR-1260. Alas my medium format HP1000c printer is too old and too expensive to replace. This is the only network parallel port print server solution I could find. Make sure you check the printer compatibility list. Set up is easy if you don't try anything fancy. I did set it up using DHCP instead of a fixed address just to see if I could do it. Yup, it worked. Never thought printing a test page could be so exciting."
4,god little unit,"I like how tiny this unit is, it takes up no useable space in my somewhat small office, since it attaches directly to the parallel port on the back of the printer. Setup was easy, I had 3 Windows XP machines configured & printing in 30 minutes. The only downside is that the ink monitor utility on my Epson printer will not work, I don't think there is any way around that. I was getting a communication error on all 3 computers every time I printed even though the print job went through, but was able to disable the error notification in the printer driver (had to do this on each computer). Overall, a good print server for the price. I would recommend it."
1,"Horrible software, possible the worst tech support ever","On the second PS101 Print Server (the first was defective), It only took me 5 hours over four nights and 3 tech calls to get it to work. The tech support only made it worse. Netgear should be ashamed of its tech support. Lazy and looking for any excess to dish off the problem. First they blamed the laptop, and then they blamed the printer and then the router....THE NETGEAR Router which has been work seemlessly for a year and a half. I finally scrapped the software and tech support, who were barely comprehensible, and installed the print server via the Router software and Vista. Seems to be stable and working for now."
3,"Fun, laid back, but poor quality video and audio","This Little Mule video is great, I thoroughly enjoyed it and would have loved it had the video quality and the audio quality been a bit better. That said, I recommend this video based on the premise that it's about a guy that wants to go out and see some stuff, in some far off places, in the one of the most exposed methods possible. Lots of little things go wrong along the way, but he smiles his way through all of it. He's living the dream I've been having for years! Watch the video, merely for the sake of watching it. If you're an ADV Junkie, you'll likely enjoy it."
5,Good Music Lives Forever!,"I love this Album-CD. I bought it for just one song I didn't have in my collection- 'Stumblin'in' with Suzy Quatro, and then I ended up loving all the rest as well, which by the way were all new to me- with the exception of ""Living Next Door to Alice"" that I already had in my files from before. This is what good music is all about. It does not matter if the songs were not mainstream or renown tunes; when something is good nothing else matters. Time can never mar or fade tunes like that. Good 70s' Rock-falk music! I am very happy I bought it!"
5,A helpful book.,When I graduated ( MA Fine Art) a fellow art student gave me this book intending it to be a joke. I applied what I learned from reading this book and was thereafter successful in marketing my art product. I recommend this book.
1,Don't buy this item!,"Geeze, I have no idea how many pocket mirrors I have had but it's been quite a few. This one was a very big disappointmet. It was the most that I had ever spent. Within a few weeks, the mirror fell out then the hinge failed. I should have complained but I let it go."
3,"Average product, good price.","The price is not bad, thats why I gave it 3 stars... (had it cost me more than $6, I would have rated it two or one stars). Bought A+ German last year thinking it would help me in my first semester German studies at college.. I used it I think twice, and never again. A good german course book is so much more useful than this product. I think this might be a good product to review your grammar and vocabulary with, but its not a good idea to use this as your only way of learning German. If you want a whole German course, I would recommend looking at ""Ultimate German""."
1,"Warning, This unit will fail.","Please read the review from WhiteHerring before you purchase. I had the same exact thing happen to mine. It works wonderfully... for a while and then fails completely. Mine lasted about the same length of time, 9 months, with all the same symptoms."
3,Supports L2TP VPN,"The Linksys BEFSX41 is a faster and superior router to this Netgear box. I've found Linksys products in general to be more reliable than Netgear. BUT, I've be migrated to a new VPN client that utilizes IPsec L2TP. Although the Linksys does support IPsec pass thru, it does not allow L2TP. This NetGear router does. The print server is a nice plus, IF you want the router right next to the printer. I don't. So if you need L2TP, then this router is a good value. If you can spend more, I would suggest the SMC Baricade SMCBR18VPN. Its better quality and supports L2TP. But it lacks the print server and costs more."
2,DHCP stalls,"I upgraded my home net with several pieces of Netgear hardware, including the FR114P router, the WG102 Wifi Access Point, and the FS108P, an 8-port switch with 4 Power Over Ethernet (POE) ports. The AP and the POE switch have been excellent choices. Not so with the router. Although it has features you don't find in a lot of consumer routers, like stateful packet inspection (SPI), logging, and email alerts, it just kept dropping connections to my home PCs for no apparent reason that I could find, and no support from Netgear. The DHCP server would seem to die, and all my home PCs would then lose their IPs and revert to private IPs (169.254.x.x). At that point my only recourse was to restart the router. After three weeks of this nonsense, I said to he** with it. I'm sending it back. The router I'm interested in now is the SMC Barricade Plus SMCBR14VPN."
2,u want to be their alpha tester?,"I have been using RT314 for over a year, and it's great! A few days ago, I saw FR114P at Fry's. I think it's about time to have a wired router/firewall/printer server product for around [hundred dollars]. I bought it, but I never got the printer server to work. I was on the phone with a tech support and a 2nd level senior tech support for over an hour. we've tried everything, nothing worked. The senior level tech support told me that a higher senior tech support would contact me. I have a HP deskjet 952Cerr... I returned the product on the same day. Since the product is new, you might want to wait awhile to buy this supposedly great product unless you want to be their alpha tester.I would buy it again when the product matures........."
1,Fails after 1 year (if you're lucky); BAD customer service.,"My router failed after 1 year. It was then replaced by Netgear with another lemon (after hours of ""home-tests"" and dealing with several incompitent, rude, English-language impaired service reps). After the replacement failed within 1 month, I was no longer eligible to recieve anymore help from Netgear. I got the run around treatment (they refused to transfer me to a manager or even listen to my complaints) and unless you pay $35-$50 for another warranty, they will just cover their ears and say, ""La-la-la-la-la--."" Don't bother with this scrapmetal. I recommend D-Link products."
3,"Printer Server function never worked, then box died.","Got a good deal on a very gently used unit, and the print server was a nice 'extra'. But I never succeeded in getting the server to recognize that a printer was connected! Decided it simply wasn't worth the hassle as the router/firewall/access point functionality worked OK (after a few upgrades to the software). Then one of the electrolytic capacitors in the power supply of the box exploded. Perhaps Netgear is a victim of counterfeit components... or maybe the design is simply too cheap. No matter. The less-than-satisfactory ownership experience will lead me to try a competitor out when I shop for a new box."
2,Well its a condom but a bad one at that,okay so this condom is very dry only the outside is lubriacted and its not even that well lubed but. It does work but it ripped so i dont suggest buying it unless you have more then when or you dont move really fast because if you are rough in bed this will tear.
2,Bukowski,"This is definitely a Bukowski book. The story reads like most all of his books; womanizing, gambling, drinking, inability to maintain a job, and more drinking. I would have given this book 5 stars if I had not purchased and read 4 of his other books. I felt like I had already read this book before I was through half the book."
4,hank's short stories,deadpan often depressing and brutallyhonest collection of short stories. never a feel good story in this collection. know that when you start reading it
5,Bukowski's calamitous columns made me a believer early on.,"my friend called me a bastard and told me i'd done it thewrong way. apparently yr sposed to read bukowski like this:poetry, novels, short stories, and then, maybe, the collectionof columns he wrote for the newspaper, Open City ..do i regret anything?no.this was bukowski w/out limits. he cursed, imagined, joked,and, especially, drank like nobody...he wrote, had affairs, got in fights, and, again, drank...he drank....the best thing about *Notes of a Dirty Old Man* is that it'sgutsy...it's for the masses, anybody who can afford a paper...it's smart, and lewd, and cutting, and all the rest...prime stuff, as far as i'm concerned...close to the man...not at all second rate compared to the novels, poems, etc...and maybe i am a bastard...but there are other reasons forthat..."
4,Not his best,"Although Notes of a Dirty Old Man was the book that got me hooked on Bukowski, it is easily my least favorite. It took me very long to finish, often finding myself so angry at him that I couldn't bear to read another word. However, a good writer ought to make you feel something, even if it's despise."
5,How can you go wrong?,"One of the best from Bukowski. There is not much I can say here that hasn't been said about Bukowski already, so I will just say that if you are a fan of his short story work, this is one to check out. It's a collection of his newspaper articles that ran in San Francisco free papers, under the article title of ""Notes of a Dirty Old man"", hence the name of the book. If you've been curious about the man's writing, this book, ""Post Office"", and ""Hollywood"" are great places to start."
4,random acts of literary madness,"Bukowksi worked well when given every writers dream: carte blanche to write whatever he felt like writing, only to have it reproduced by the LA FREE PRESS and on the streets in a week, being read by thousands. Bukowski himself writes of the magical feeling of having the freedom to write whatever he wanted and the sudden notoriety he aquired with his new exposure. This collection of stories, as opposed to the ones collected elsewhere, show Bukowski still experimenting with a variety of forms and this book contain a marked sense of surrealism and a even a polemical political bent, something which Bukowski usually had little stomach for; he gets in a few good ones at the expense of the false prophets of the 60's countercultural scene, a much needed antidote to the disgusting mythologizing that has always accompanied the free-love generation."
2,Self-hatred made hip,"This book is loose and sometimes funny, and certainly Bukowski had a good deal of wit, but after about 50 pages I got sick of hearing the ramblings of a self-hating alcoholic and his hip 60s drug/sex/drink-until-you-vomit adventures. Bukowski comes across as nothing more than a coward, a drunk, and an all-around loser, and if that's your idea of inspiration or something that you can relate to then enjoy."
1,Advice coming from the negative viewpoint,"The entire feel of the book is that the seperated/divorced men are rats and the single women are victims. There may be a word or two that could be useful to some, but the majority of the text leans towards disposing of the relationship, whatever the case may be. What comes accross from the co-author can be summed up with the following: end the relationship, amend the relationship or continue the relationship. Anyone who can choose an ice cream flavor can figure that out all by herself. Save your money."
2,would not purchase,I did not get a good feel for this book. I did not find it useful in the dating curcuit. There are better choices out there. Learning to date after your divorce or another's is hard no matter what you read. Nothing can prepare you really. You just have to get out there and try. Don't stick around for those emotionally unavailable.
2,Too many assumptions...,"My boyfriend actually bought this book for me, and I thought it would be really interesting to read. This book assumes a few things: 1) you are a female who has never been married, AND 2) you do not have children of your own, AND 3) your (soon-to-be-divorced) boyfriend lives in the same town as his soon-to-be-ex. Since I do not fit into that neat category, I found many of the ideas and scenarios interesting, but quite irrelevant. Beware, it also paints men with a fairly broad ""selfish jerk"" brush. Instead of reassuring me that this was a situation that was well withing my abilities to deal with, it resurrected old insecurities."
4,Makes Sense,"Tackling a relationship with a man in the seperated/newly divorced category is a huge endeavor. It takes a special person to put up with the constant variables and cob-web of emotions. This book is a helpful guide and really gives honest feedback and solutions. Stuff your friends would like to say, but don't for fear they get their heads bit off! I thought the author painted an accurate picture with this book and it helped me keep things in perspective. It was a big help during the relationship- for my own sanity- and refreshing to finally find solace with someone who can truly understand (via case studies and her own experiences). Also- it is important not to delve yourself too far into the chaos and keep your own outside interests going. I agree with the first person who reviewed this - if you find your self lured into a relationship of this sort- take the exit ramp! But, if you're for certain and in for the long haul, strap on your seatbelt."
5,Great advice....for all types of relationships,"This is a great book, and it is based on a true premise: if you are a dating female, you have better than a 50:50 chance of running into a man that is separated but not divorced. I know this is true from personal experience. However, many of the tips in the book have a wider application, for example, any relationship that is struggling with communication issues, family difficulties and committment phobias. Being ""smart"" in any relationship is not always easy and remembering that ""your happiness in in YOUR hands"" often gets lost along the way. My copy of this book is underlined, check marked, highlighted and dog-earred. It is an excellent read, great style and upbeat. I would recommend it for anyone in a dating situation, especially for those dating separated (or recently divorced) men."
4,putting things in perspective,"This book was just the thing I needed. Although my current experience doesn't mirror many of the examples (i.e. she left him, I'm not ready to meet the kids, it hasn't become overly physical, he's been great...), it put the situation into such perspective. There can be a middle ground as long as you don't lose sight of taking care of yourself in the process. And it was so helpful to be reminded to get out of the ""how the relationship should look"" mindset. It has definitely helped me to remain calm while we figure things out."
4,"So far, the best account of Betty's story.","You'll need to speak with Betty yourself, and yes, she's willing to talk but I think Bella Stumbo did a very fantastic job of telling the story from both sides.Yes, I had to make a judgement call on the ""Dan and Linda"" side. They are both dead.If you are interested in this case, get a copy and read the story. If you are REALLY interested, drop Betty a line. She'll probably write you back."
1,Premeditated Action,If Betty could not satisfy Dan perhaps she had the problem. What were Dan's needs? That should have been her question. Actions speak louder than words and Betty's actions were a direct result of dysfunctional reasoning. I feel for their family and all touched by the ultimate devastating incident.
4,"A fast-paced, violent thriller","In this novel, David Cole introduces us to the seamier side of life on the American side of the border with Mexico. His protagonist, a woman who has had a nightmare past including criminal convictions, is an expert in using computers to track illegal bank accounts. She also is an expert in creating new identities for herself. While working with American law enforcement officials, she discovers the horrors of illegal trafficking in women, particularly from Eastern Europe. Corruption is everywhere. Characters betray each other; some are gunned down. The shorthand language of computerese pops up in the middle of normal prose. Cole paints a bleak picture, but it will hold your attention."
5,An Excellent Series,"I am constantly looking for great mysteries to read. After reading the first three books in this series (Butterfly Lost, The Killing Maze, and Stalking Moon), this is an excellent series for those who like mysteries set in the American Southwest. David Cole's outlook of the Hopi and Navajo traditions and cultures add to the intensity of this mystery. He builds a compelling protagonist, Laura Winslow, who is a computer hacker that you never completely learn about. In each book, she changed somewhat but still you never fully understand her. The character's dialogue is genuine and persuasive, while the plots are gripping and suspenseful. Each book has been hard to put down and step away from, you have to see what happens next."
3,Not available,Was every disappointed that this cd was no longer available! I really wanted the song Stay Awhile.
5,great watch!,"I've worn this watch for about a month with no scratches or even a dent on the face. It's a great watch, keeps perfect time, never needs a battery. As one reviewer said, looks even better in person. Really glad I bought it!"
2,AI?,"I found this game tedious keeping up your different resource lines. Where it got really silly were situations where one has twelve or more enemy (AI) attacking and the defenders are all dead, yet one can play on and on making a new fighter now and then who gets killed pretty quickly while the attackers destroy one or two buildings at a time meanwhile your villagers work on right by the fighting. In fact I moved a villager to repair the barracks while it was under attack and this one worker often repaired faster than the six or seven attackers did damage."
5,Fun... but for how long?,"Like all the Age of Empires games, this one has its flaws- however, it is without a doubrt the best title in the AoE series. The addition of walls and garrisoning puts it far above the originals, the several added civilizations puts it above Age of Empire II, Not Gold Edition, and the simplicity and attractiveness puts it above Age of Mythology. If you're looking for a MAC RTS game, buy this one. Then buy Command and Conquer, Generals. You'll love them both."
3,Good Game except..........,"I bought this game after purchasing an iBook with the intention of playing against all of my friends. While the game play holds true to the original game in single player, you CAN NOT play against your PC friends for the ""forseeable future"" for that reason I can not give the game a 5 star review..."
4,No Mac/PC Multiplayer,"In answer to some reviewers here: no Mac/PC Multiplayer possible. Only Mac/Mac. Destineer says they're trying what they can do about it. Honestly, I suspect there's some Microsoft policy involved here. Why else is inter-system multiplayer possible with far most other games?"
1,Does not run on Lion,"Be warned that this only runs if you have Rosetta on your Mac, which Lion Mac's don't have anymore. If you have Lion, this will not work, period."
4,Great Game,"The only downside to this game is that you have to constantly take your eyes off the screen to press keyboard buttons. A two button mouse would probably eliminate much of this problem. Otherwise, one of the best games I've played!"
5,Absolutely amazing,"I don't own this game, but I plan on buying it after playing at my friend's house. The graphics are amazing, the armies are awesome. The fact that you have to grow food and mine for gold adds to the realism."
5,"Great Game, but with a lot of bugs","At last. A Mac version of Age Of Empires II. Altought it is a great game it seems that these guys didn't have time to finish it before October, 31 (shipping day) and shipped the beta version. I get an ""Unexpectely Quit"" error all the time (Tried it on different machines), and this [is bad] when you are playing a multiplayer game. I hope they fix it soon."
4,"Great game, spoiled by networking issues","Having played every one of the AoE games from the very beginning, I was delighted to find a Mac port of AoE II Gold. The gameplay is great, and is seriously addictive. The only downside (which has resulted in this game receiving only four stars) is that network play between Macs and PCs is not possible, and gameplay between two or more Macs is problematic. This is highly unusual for a Mac game, but of course, the problem can be seen written all over a big banner in the main screen ""Microsoft.""This is the only issue i have with this game, in all other respects it is one of the best strategy games ever made."
2,Very Disappointing,"I purchased this product to play on my iMac, running OSX Snow Leopard. The game crashes every few minutes. I researched updates for this product and found that I have the most up to date version of the game. Due to the very frequent crashes the game is unplayable. I really like Age of Empires II. I like it better than III, but it will not work. I spent a lot of money for a game that is unplayable.If you are running Snow Leopard, or Lion as my research indicates, do not buy this game, as it will not play properly. My pre-purchase research indicated that Update 1.0.5 had fixed the crash issues. And, that this update would allow play for a machine running Snow Leopard. In fact, the game I bought is version 1.0.6, and will not play.I bought a very expensive paperweight. Disappointing!!"
3,Fun game but buggy multiplayer,"At home, we have several Mac computers hooked up to a simple Ethernet LAN. I have tried changing many settings, but 90% of all multiplayer games between any 2-3 Mac computers have failed to stay connected for the entire game. Otherwise a fun game, and I enjoyed the single player scenarios."
5,So many to choose from,I now have a large variety of these throughout my home. I found switch plates to match the decor of each room.
3,Very in depth,"Gave me much more information than I needed or wanted, despite the cartoony look it gave great detail on experiments and the conclusions about quantum theory drawn form them but a lot of the maths went right over my head. I think I'll come back to this when I have a greater understanding of the topic, not the first book you want to pick up on the topic."
5,Introducing Quantum Theory,"This is an excellent book for introducing quantum theory. It is presented in a very interesting way through the personalities of the people who created quantum theory. The physics includes enough of the mathematics and equations to be useful as a supplement for a quantum physic text for anyone who desiresa ""biographical"" approach to quantum physics. The conceptual prersentation of quantum theory in this book ranks with the best I have seen in my 40 year history of teaching quantum physics."
2,"great outline, poor execution","I'm afraid I disagree with the other reviewers. The book was not well written. The illustrations were of marginal value -- I guess it's always nice to know what these guys look like. Most troublesome to me, however, was the manner in which the explanations were utterly substandard. If you are looking to understand the material -- as opposed to merely becoming familiar with the names and faces of those whose work you want to understand -- you're much, much better off the the Gribbon or the David Albert book."
3,A Perplexing (but good) Introduction of Quantum Theory,"This was certainly a fun book to read. The illustation and simple language made the book interesting, if not completely understandable. HOWEVER, if you're looking for a comprehensive explaination of one of the most perplexing scientific schools of thought, this is not your book. It only whet my whistle before I read ""Alice in Quantumland"" and ""In Search of Schrodinger's Cat."""
3,A fun history and theories of Quantum Physics,"I can say off the bat that I had trouble with this book. Although I learned about Schrodinger, Bohr, Heisenberg, Einstein, Newton, Plank, Dirac, Born as well as their theories, I found it to be a demanding subject for anyone. Although the book is an introduction, I would gather the book presumes you have some previous knowledge of (probably findamental) algebra, chemistry, thermodynamics and a solid foundation of QED. Seriously, its a good book and well written, and made hard conecpts a little bit easier to understand. Math has never been my subject so you may have better luck with it."
2,Look good but no stamina,"I bought John one pair of each color. After 4 months of wearing them, the pockets are tearing from the main part of the shorts. The material is not very durable. The shorts are tearing around the pockets. There is no reinforcement for men to put wallets in pockets, etc. We were very happy when they got here. John liked the way that they feel and they look good, they just don't have any stamina. I would pay a little more for them to be made out of better material."
3,How to Restore Your Collector Car CHECK EDITION,"This is a very good informative book. However check which edition you are buying. This book was published in 1984 with the newer edition in 1999. A lot has changed particularly as to suppliers, paint technical information and welding information. I would highly recommend you skip this edition and go buy the newer edition."
2,how to restore your collector car,"information is too general to be helpful. there are many other, better written, more helpful books out the. matt joseph's restoration bible is MUCH better. save your money for something else."
2,Book for the true beginner,"Unless you have never shot a game of darts this book is probably not for you. Carey starts off the book by describing darting history which itself is a short yet interesting story and goes on to explain the basics of darting, i.e. how you probably should stand, hold the dart, etc. nothing elaborate on that though. Then he goes on to describe the different games that can be played. Pretty simple, pretty basic. If you have played and caught the bug and are looking for some more critical insights or instruction, this is not the book that you want. If you are clueless then this is as good a place to start as any."
2,Basic Book,I guess this is a good overall view of a simple but difficult game. I got more information reading articles on the Internet. I should have gone for something more advanced or with better stories. It covers all the basic bases and if I made a contribution to the group that sponsors darts in the United States I am glad. It is about a 90 minute read - maximum. If I was of the type I would have read it and returned it but I have a conscience. If I picked it up in the store I would not have made a purchase. Lesson learned.
4,Good qiuck guide,This book can be used as a wuick guide for beginners. It gives some tips and information about the history of some of the common games. I wouldn't recommend this book though if you are really concerned about the complications of technique and style.
2,One of the worst covers and one of the best songs,The Joy Division cover is horrid and is vomit inducing. And this is coming from someone who enjoys the Nouvelle Vague cover.The acoustic version of Nobody puts baby in the corner is brilliant. Pitch the dastardly electric version.Fallout Boy overachieves. They are awesome at genius and are awesome at sucking.
5,Amazing!!!!,"This album is everything a good acoustic project should be: heartfelt, sharp, and amazing! Every song on this disc is great, including the cover of ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"". ""Grand Theft Autumn"" is also much different from the electric version, but is a way that fits the acoustic sound perfectly. The included dvd is also a very entertaining distraction. Pick this one up, you won't be disappointed!"
4,Where is your boy tonight?,"If you are a Fall Out Boy fan, this album is a must. If you have ever heard Fall Out Boy live, I do not even know why you are hesitating to purchase this EP---so, I will tell you, it is amazing! The guitar sound is so strong, it feels like they are sitting in the room playing for you. The lyrics are both cynical and, in FOB style, bitter. It is great to hear the new songs from the guys, and they deliver them so well on this album! My only wish is that there were more than 5 songs. The DVD is just an added bonus and a step back from the real reason to buy--the MUSIC!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Ibought this for my 3 year old and was very disappointed. First of all, you can't tap on carpet so if you don't have a tv by hard floors you can't tap and watch the dvd at the same time. Not only are the shoes pretty silly looking, they are a real pain to put on. I returned it and went to payless and bought her a real pair to play with for less money!!!"
3,"Good guide as always, but not LP's best for sure...","I've been fortunate enough to have used Lonely Planet books throughout Europe, Australia and parts of North America and have always found them reliable and accurate. However, the Washington DC edition falls quite short of the LP standard that I have become used to.First of all, of course the information on attractions and especially security is vastly out of date, but more importantly, there were more than a couple recommendations that I followed in the guide that led me to a closed bar (twice), a bad place to eat (three times), and a REALLY BAD hostel recommendation. What was said in the guide to be the best hostel around turned out to be the worst one I've ever stayed in.There were far more popular guides with the people I met, the Let's Go being the guide of choice. Having used the LP to some frustration, I would recommend using an alternate source of info for your trip to the Capital."
4,"Great for your first, second and third time. Very thorough","This is my second summer living in Washington, DC during an internship and about my fifth time here. I have visited just about every major site that is accessible by public transportation, and some that aren't. I bought this book because it includes a blurb about the history of some of the major sites, sidetrips into Maryland and Virginia and lots of decent restaurants for a student on a budget. Perhaps it includes a bit too much info on traveling to DC (how to get there, visa info, etc. etc.) but it's a guidebook for the outsider primarily."
1,Trying too hard,"The author tries way too hard to make this into a romance novel. The various descriptions of DC being a woman in high heels and yet in a business suit, and riding in limos and also sleeping on the streets, etc. were hyper annoying. I enjoy good prose, this was not it. And it's a travel book, not a harlequin novel. Aside from the tone, I found the information offered was often lacking. There was nothing about the numerous options for paid tours of the city's historic sites. There was very little useful in the dining section if you wanted something more than cafe fare.I usually love books in the Lonely Planet series, but this one didn't measure up."
1,Not really DC,"I have been living in DC for the past 2 years and bought the LP as a gift for a friend. As a resident, let me tell you ... this guide falls MUCH below expectations. Published in 2001 Feb, it does not take into account any of the new security regulations, road closures, etc. Futhermore, the listings for restaurants, bars and clubs is not only prehistoric, but also very ""old-school"" ... none of the hip DC places are included. I would supplement this by checking Washington Post's website - they are much better. Cheers,"
3,usefull but has an acceptable flaw,This book is perfect.It contains all informations you need in DC.The only thing missing is its limited picture.You need to recognize the name of the building and look for the picture by yourself.It will be easier to find the building if you know what it looks like.The map is very-very usefull.
5,Costume buyer,This product arrived sooner than expected and was exactly as pictured. I was very pleased and would order from this company again.
1,Awful company,I have tried to contact this company for a return and I still haven't heard from them.I have called and emailed them also.Awful service
5,The Golden Tarot cards are gorgeous.,"I gave these a five star rating because of the artwork on each card. It is outstanding and I love looking at them. Deck comes with a little history book of each character. I plan on using them as ideas for my ""altered"" art and not reading the tarot. I would recommend these to anyone who is a lover of art as well as tarot."
4,Good for collection,My Rider Waite deck seems to give a more accurate prediction than the Golden Tarot.
1,i missed card,"first time i miss 8 card ,replacedment i missed 6 card again,return to Amazon,what the hall is that? Waster my money and time !!!! be ware ! check how many card in the box !"
3,Golden Tarot Deck,"It is very beautiful, the package and the card, but I did not like the imagens, they looks like Victorian Age. I like more fantasy and so. In fact I given them away to someone. I did not keep them."
5,Perfect,"These cards are nicely made with BEAUTIFUL images. And they seem to work... very much so...(and they have golden lining, witch is always good.)"
3,"Artistic detail is intricate, but religious symbolism...?","I appreciate the effort that went into making this deck. Ignoring the figures themselves, the quality of the artwork is nice. I like the golden edges too. The cards don't stick together.Personally, though, I don't care for christian figures that appear throughout the deck. (Jesus, Adam & Eve, Angels, etc) I didn't expect that at all, and I would not have purchased this deck had I known how heavily the church and religion appear in this deck as influences."
5,"Beautiful Images, Gilded Edges","I've been using the Golden Tarot Deck ever since it came out. The card stock is high quality, the artwork is beautiful and the gilded edges make the deck stand out. Clients constantly comment on the beautiful artwork, and even the 'darker' cards are less menacing as in some decks. Although the cards are easy for readers to connect with, this deck is worth buying just for the artwork alone."
3,Great art work,"I gave a lot of thought before purchasing this deck. I wouldn't say it's a disappointment, it's just the cards are somehow difficult to shuffle. I am not saying the size (I have the Nigel Jackson tarot which is way bigger than this). The cards simply stick together. But I believe it'd get better later, it's not a big concern. Other than that, I expected the color of the cards would be a little 'brighter'. perhaps it's the paper material that makes it less impressive. In general, it's a great deck and worth the $$."
5,Es increible la calidad,"ademas de las impresionantes imagenes, la calidad conque esta elaborado es excepcional, no cabe duda que es de las mejores ediciones que ha hecho us games"
2,Gold leaks onto your hands,The deck is pretty even though the artwork is overly Christian. The US Games logo is small on the picture side of each card. The gold lining on the cards is beautiful. What's not beautiful is the glitter all over your hands when you shuffle the deck. The gold is obviously a cheap quality is that gets everywhere!
4,Lovely cards but very stiff!,"The Golden Tarot deck is fabulous. I connected with it right away. The images are easy for a beginner to interpret, but lasting enough for me to use this deck for a long time. The only downside is how freaking stiff the cards are! The laminate over the cards makes them so difficult to shuffle that I gave myself blisters. I spent last night running the cards over corners on my table to bang them up a bit so I could handle them. I've bent them every way possible. The good news is, they still look great. The bad news is, I don't know how much it helped. Oh well, back to shuffling!"
5,A Lovely Deck - Executed in the True Spirit of Tarot,This deck is a work of Art and was executed as such. It is not a bizarre mutation or some other attempt to push someone's personal agenda but is rather an tasteful expression of the blending of Art and Arte for its own purpose. The assembly of figures and symbols from different sources for collage is careful and well thought out. The blending of these images into seamless compositions is truly a treat for the eyes as well as for the Sight.
4,Beautiful Deck,"This is my first tarot deck. I like the images on the cards, they are beautiful - I would not have known they were collages of Renaissance art unless I had read the book. My only complaint is that the cards are heavy and are a bit difficult to shuffle. Otherwise, a great deck!!"
4,Just edges are gilded,"I find this deck very easy to read though it is hard to shuffle. I took another reviewer's advice and limbered the cards over the edge of my table to make them more flexible during shuffling. This has helped some. The card stock out of which the deck is made is thicker than other cards which makes the cards stiffer and the deck harder to handle since the whole deck is deeper and hard to get your hand around, and I have larger hands. This said the artwork is lovely.I was expecting to see gilt on the front of the card too, to some extent, which it is not. Only the outside edges of the cards are gilted and lovely, but on the face or back, the ""gold"" is really just yellow printing.I'll let the other reviewers say the rest. I do like this deck. It seems to convey deep spiritual meaning, especially from the Majors. The minors are enough like Rider Waite that reading is fairly easy."
5,Golden Tarot is Beautiful,This is a beautiful tarot deck. If you are a collector this is a good deck to have. It has a medieval feel and is just gorgeous. I am very glad I purchased it.
1,bad item,There was improper alignment on these cards so they printed incorrectly with parts of the image going off the top of each card. Keep an eye on the return date.
3,It's just OK,"I was disappointed with the image quality of the DVD. For HD TV, it will probably fill up half of the screen. If you zoom it to the full screen, the resolution is really poor if you get used to HDTV. The subbtitle are fine. I enjoyed it anyway."
4,Don't look now we're being shot at,Very funny film. Don't be put off by the French subtitles - most of the dialogue is English with minimal subtitles required. Very good quality DVD.
3,Teaching Football Skills--Youth League Football Vol #1,"I can't argue with the coaches' credentials, but I can disagree with some of the techniques he coaches and the way the players react to his coaching is somewhat suspect. He teaches one thing and the kids sometimes do the opposite. The tape does do a good job of teaching the novice coach some very good basics. But please research the techniques you attend to teach."
1,THIS BOOK [is bad],"i absolutly HATED this book. i am morbelly obese and i USED to be aneorexic. ... there were wuite a few errors in this book. one of them that was used frequently was ""all of A sudden"" when everyone KNOWS its all of THE sudden. to put it plainly, THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE!"
4,Chris benoit's newest figure,This is his new figure it has the new attire of 4real it is a cool figure for any diehard chris fan.
5,Health care 2020,The book was very good. I would recommend it to any health care professional. It magnified how health care will be evolved in the future.
2,I feel cheated,Too long.....and where's Martin in the DVD? I bought it hoping that Martin Lawrence would be making some appearances but i was wrong. NOt impressed
1,"impossible in the united states, I guess",". because the song is actually sampling the voice of the german chancelor Gerhard Schröder (most powerful politician in germany- like bush nowedays in the USA). a television camera team caught him giving autographs during an election campagne joking around: ""gib mir mal 'ne flasche bier, sonst streik ich hier"" (by accident a rhyme). in english something like: ""bring me some beer, or else im going to go on strike""its a kind of merchandising product from a famous and funny german tv show called ""tv total"" hosted by Stefan Raab.the question is: would you buy something like this for the music? I suggest not.buy it for its oddity. or even better, let it be."
5,Good way to get some Villans,Have a good story plot but want to throw some extra spice and give an older villan new spice or need one right a way this book is good for all dms who want to go beyond the Monster Manuals
3,low tech but CREEPY,"This game doesn't have a lot of graphical oomph or amazing gameplay.. but somehow it's able to deliver and amazing level of creepiness that I've not found in many other games. I swear when I descended into the crypt, I was running to the barely visible exit in a state of panic. Only after some undead thing rose up out of the fog and got me as I was clamoring up the ladder did I realized how freaked out I was. At the Retry screen noticed that my heart was racing, my hands were shaking, and I was sitting in the dark. I took off my headphones and stood up for a minute.It wasn't as scary the second time through.. but that first try.. whew, freaky!"
2,This book is a NO!,"The unacceptable number of errors/answers found on those 500+ questions will definitely confuse you. The reference link provided for each question does not contain adequate info. The ""flash cards"" aren't nothing but two questions on each page. It's still a book, not cards. These show the lack of responsibility of the authors. Don't trust this book. The money is better off used on other books."
4,Good for last minutes before examination,It is a good book for preparing examination. You can use it as an exercise book. Finish one chapter with Sybex and then do the same chapter in this book. Your knowledge can be strength. I think you cannot use one book for examination.
5,I Can't get enough of Richie,"I've read alot of books.. Richie has to be my favorite Author, she is genius her plots are amazing. and she knows how to make you feal just like teh charcter, I have to say i prefer her series the unseen, but this is probably my favorite book of hers after those.."
5,"""Should be a MOVIE""",This story is one of Richie's best...the plot is twisted and you'll never know what's going to happen next ..and you'll never guess who's the bad guy ...that what make this story GREAT!!!be sure to read it.
1,Wrong photo,"The W20TN is a set for the back seat, not the front, as shown in the photo! It is the wrong photo. The photo does not show the actual W20!"
1,Wrong product,"Like other posters, I received the wrong matts. Not sure how this keeps happening, but it does. My advice is to look elsewhere."
1,DRY ERASE BOARD WITH MARKER,"WHAT?? AMAZON CHARGED ME HOW MUCH FOR THIS 4 DOLLAR OR LESS THING? By paying as much as I did, I was so excited to get what I thought was to be a prize of a dry erase board...NOT...It is only a simple little board with frame coming apart and marker that was completely without ink or any marking ability. sooooooooooo people beware of this one..I have to use a a regular marker on it..taped the frame back together and erase it with a mr clean sponge...I'm inovative don'tcha see. No point in going to trouble of returning it....sorry Amazon, first complaint I've ever had....but thought you ought to know."
4,great book,This book gave great insight to the way things really work between the FBI and the Mafia.
1,Lying Liars and the Lies they tell,"This book purports to be the story behind the FBI's take down of big-time Gambino crime boss Paul Castellano. The authors, two ex-agents set themselves up as the heroes in this cops-and-robbers tale.It's too bad that the story ends up being an almost complete fabrication, because there's some truly entertaining ""tales"" told in this book. Forced to resign from the FBI, O'Brien and Kurins probably made more money from this sham of a book then they did in their crime fighting careers.Maybe they learned from the criminals they watched for so many years, eh?"
4,Almost perfect,"I felt that Boss of Bosses was a great Mafia book. If you enjoy The Godfather then you'll love Boss of Bosses. I think my favorite part of the book was when the FBI had to plant a bug in Castallano's house. The tricky part was that Paul never left his house. One thing that was nice knowing, was that the authors were the actual detectives assinged to the case. This means it's true to life, no embelishing! One slow part in the book was the hours of tapes that were meaningless to the story that the FBI explianed. This is what kept me from giving the book five stars. I love hearing about mafia and this book was great for that. I knew I wasn't getting rumors I was getting the real scoop on things. I think everyone should read Boss of Bosses by Andris Kurins and Joseph O'Brien."
3,Not bad for non- fiction,"Boss of Bosses was not a book I would have normally chosen to read for pleasure. I was assigned to read this book through school and I was pleasantly surprised. As all books that have to establish a timeline do, this book started out really slow. By the time I reached midpoint, I was deeply engrossed in the reading. If you are into non-fiction law enforcement books, this is a highly recommeded read. If your not, it is still a decent book to sit down with."
2,Wants to be a movie,"This book is written as if it were being shaped for the movies, which makes me doubt its credibility. What ever happened to good non-fiction book writing based on multiple sources, research, etc. People should know that the two FBI agents who put this book together (using a ghostwriter, probably) were fired by the Bureau for using confidential FBI information and for inaccurately glorifying their own roles in the investigation. So much for objective reporting."
5,Should not miss this CD,I would recommend this CD to everyone because it includes easy listening music and the price is a good deal ...
3,"Good, but missing a nice track","With some terrific covers, the ommission of Stan Vincent's ""Ooh Child"" (which appeared on Nina's original ""Here Comes the Sun"" release in 1971) to me makes this LP a disappointment."
2,Not what it could have been,"Nina Simone is one of my favorite singers.She has a powerful voice that is deeply expressive.Usually her arrangements complement the meaning of the song.I think of 'Wild is the Wind' with her passionate, swirling piano playing.(Not on the CD under review.)""Here Comes the Sun"" should have been a great CD. It has many excellent songs on it. But for some reason Nina is not at her best.Her singing just does not get across the emotion she is capable of. Many of the songs have a 'pop' accompaniment with vocal backing, which takes the punch out of them.'My Way' has a frantic beat throughout, which to me just does not sound right.Only 'I Loves You Porgy' and 'My Baby Just Cares for Me' showcase the real Nina Simone, and these tracks are available on other CDs. Thankfully there are many other Nina Simone CDs around which present this great artist in her true colors."
2,to bad,The seller was great but the product was to high when you put it on a floor jack to use with the truck raised 22 inches off the ground on jack stands. For the guy with a way to lift the truck easly it would work fine but for the back yard mechanic it doesn't work
4,Heavy,I purchased this transmission jack adapter last year and found it heavy with a lot of chains and bolts. Located owners manual online. Truthfully; it has not yet been out of the box for use.
3,It worked,"Instructions would have been handy. I also had to build an adapter to fit into the female jack pad mount that my jack has. After that, it did the job, but I was only sliding the transmission back to replace a flex plate."
1,wrong picture,The picture shown is not the book listed. Both books do have the same ISBN number some how. So if you order it you my get either book.
2,50/50,"DO NOT BE FOOLED! The book that is being shipped is The Wilton Way of Cake Decorating. It is a 60's- 70's hard cover book filled with an encyclopedia of knowledge and very useful information/techniques. The techniques are valuable because they are still applied today. A must-have for novices. I read the review about a guy doing multiple returns in hope of getting the updated one, Wilton Wedding Cakes, but I wont even try. While Wilton Wedding Cakes is a very good reference and idea book, the older version is more like a handbook for cake decorators. Wilton Wedding Cakes is also paperback with less pages. When I received the package, I was surprised, but not terribly upset b/c I figured it was a possibility to get the older one. I decided to give it a chance and look through the pages. I won't return because I found it very useful for an awesome price. My score is not too high because of the seller's intentional false advertising."
4,Taking care of the customer...,"Unfortunately I never received this title because it was lost in the mail. World of Books did replace the item with a comparable item, and I received it shortly afterward. At the time, I was not completely satisfied and World of Books made note of the fact. They bent over backwards and sent me another comparable title on their tab. Although they did not have to do this, they took care of their customer. In today's business world, it is hard to find a company that lives up to customer service and satisfaction guaranteed... World of Books does exemplify this principle.Thank you!"
5,Great information,I find this book very informative. Great pictures. This will really come in handy in the coming years.
3,Wilton Yearbook,Only disappointment was that this was not a hardcover as promised. I got it just to look at for cake ideas and it served its purpose.
3,Voices not performed by singers from the show,"One would expect that these Karaokes will simply use the original soundtracks from the show and attach lyrics to it, but it's NOT the case. We own the original Dora soundtracks. Although the tempo of the songs are quite identical, the voices are obviously different, and the lyrics are a little bit off. The high notes are often sung off-key (scary). It may be ok for our 3 year old, but it's such a torture to our church-music-ministry-trained ears, especially when the kids asked to repeat those songs so many times."
2,Patristics over Scripture,"I was hoping for a book to highlight the basis for the Apostle's Creed in scripture and its place in the early church. It is actually a phrase by phrase review of the writings of the early Church fathers and their understanding of the credal statements. It was not very enlightening, frequently in Latin, and a long way from Sola Scriptura."
4,Book 1,"Wendy Thomas knew how to take care of herself, as well as everyone else. At the tender age of seven, her parents took her to the airport so she could find her own way to a Broadway show and back. Her parents never worried about her, even if she disappeared for days. They believed Wendy could do no wrong. Wendy grew up to be pretty, caring, with high grades, and about to go to college.Paul Randall was the ultimate bad boy. Even the gangs steered clear of him. Wendy and Paul found themselves deeply attracted to each other. Against his will, Paul fell in love with her. However, he knew he had to let her go or she would give up all her dreams for him. Problem was that Wendy did not want to be let go. Paul would have to hurt her, badly, for her own good.**** Wendy is a bit hard to believe, but she and Paul suit each other well. This book targets those who do not want danger in their stories, just pure romance! Wonderful light reading! ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."
4,Tax Reform Info,"I'm reading Michael Reagan's book ""Making Waves"" now. The chapter that covers the various alternative tax systems needs to be updated. When Michael Reagan wrote this book (1996), the FairTax was just getting started. He talks about the ""National Sales Tax"" idea, and points out several (4 as I recall) flaws with the plan. Since his book was written, all of these ""flaws"" have been researched, considered, and taken care of. For example, the FairTax ""prebate"" plan totally untaxes the poor, by giving every legal person (but not illegals) in the US a check (or debit account deposit) each month. This ammount is negligible to the super rich, but again, completely untaxes the poor. I'd like to see Michael Reagan reconsider this chapter in his book and update it with new information since it's first edition."
4,Great commentary on America's Ways,"One of my friend's dads gave me this book to read and it was fantastic. Mike has great opinions on all subject that has to do with current issues. Liberals won't like this book but I think they should read it to get a great argument to their ideas. Mike writes as if he's right there talking to you. It's a good book explaining a lot of ""conservative"" ideas in detail. Easy reading and full of insight. It didn't get my 5 stars because Mike tends to use a lot of numbers and figures when proving his points. I know people say the numbers don't lie, but I just think people can use numbers to their advantage to easily."
3,Talk and more talk,"An unusual novel; it may even be unique. A group of characters are in perpetual conversation about a score of different topics.(In a way, it reminded me of the movie MY DINNER WITH ANDRE.) The talk is usually very interesting, with the major ""story"" being the love story of Alice Leigh and Dr. Owen North. The main thrust of this story is related by Mrs. Vincent, but it's a long haul getting there. After a hundred pages or so the reader really begins to wonder if the book is going anywhere. But like a slow blooming flower, the end result is finally reached. How appreciative you are of that blossom will determine how much you like the book. For me, not one of Mitchell's better efforts."
2,The producers of this video did not know when to fold 'em,"This was horrible, in fact the only thing that keep me from giving it 1 star was that I like some of the actors that were playing. The MC looked like an ex-jock wearing a badly fitting tux. The pretty girl (a former Miss something-or-other) was forced to wear corny outfits in order to illustrate a poker lesson, like folding laundry when they discussed folding a bad hand. And was it just me or did the poker ""expert"" look and sound a lot like Jon Lovitz? I prayed that they would just shut up so that I could watch the poker game, but they kept on reading off of the tele-prompter like someone in a bad high school video production.Yes, this video was free with my Prime membership, but even at that price I paid too much."
2,HAHAH what a horribly produced dvd.,"I REALLY wanted to watch this and learn from it, but it's hard since the hosts are so annoying and ugly. Couldn't they come up with more decent people? One of the guys talks too loud, the other guy who won a million dollars or whatever makes me want to throwup and burn my eyes. what's up with that lisp, ugh all their voices are annoying. No, I'm not a stuckup person. This dvd has HORRIBLE production. In the beginner's dvd, they don't even have a good explanation. Thank goodness I borrowed it from the library and didn't buy it. HAH. HIRE BETTER LOOKING, LESS ANNOYING PEOPLE. The black girl seems like she's trying too hard, she's (...), Iwanttopunchhertheend. UGHHH."
2,Dirty old man stuff wrecks the book...,"Some of the dialogue, and one of the eccentric premises (the urination of heavy water via the chaplain) are just as good as ""Catch-22.""Unfortunately, what is holding it all together is a bunch of dirty old man stuff.Heaven help us if it is true that old men in this post-Christian culture have absolutely nothing else to think about other than how many girls they've boffed over their lives, and how large those girls' mammaries were. I couldn't even finish this book."
2,not a deserving sequel for a awesome classic like catch-22,"individually the book isn't too bad,but as a sequel to catch22 it SUCKS!closing time tries to cash in on the phenomenal success of its prequel, but miserably fails.i advise those who haven't read catch22 yet,not to prejudge it based on closing time.catch22 is one of the best books ever!"
1,"Please, if you loved ""Catch 22"", skip this one...","Absolutely horrible. Heller doesn't hold a single coherent thought, and tries (very unsuccessfully) to mimic Vonnegut. The result is an utter mess.If you loved Catch 22, re-read it. Don't come away as disappointed as I was with this one."
4,The Unobtainable Perfection of History,"It seems most people that read this book have read Catch-22 at one time or another. And there is one undiniable fact about this book, it is simply not as good as Catch-22, but then what is?one annoying aspect is the fact that the chaplains name has changed from Catch-22 (as i'm only half way through this book, so that might be explained later, so forgive me if it is) from Shipman to Tappman. and no Orr so far either! But apart from that it is still a great book!"
3,Ho hum,"With the possible exception of the movie Aliens, sequels are almost never as good as the original. Anyone who really enjoyed Catch-22 - which is almost everyone who's ever read it - will fetch a yawn at Heller's attempt to carry on the story of Yossarian. The book's got a decent theme. It retains the brilliant temporal hackjob that would make perfect sense if you read the book twice, or backwards, like reconstructing a murder mystery. Yet it lacked an interesting plot; it seemed like nothing new was added and nothing unexpected occurred. Predictably enough, Milo Minderbinder and Ex. PFC Wintergreen ultimately put their differences aside to form a major corporate alliance. Yossarian plans a party in the subway system. Not nearly as visceral a venue as WWII. I shrugged and didn't have the heart to finish it. It's a shame, and pretty disappointing, because I had begun to think Heller was quite the genius after I downed Catch 22 and God Knows."
2,"Close, but no cigar","Well, it ain't Catch-22, and for all the talk about how this is a work in its own right and how such comparisons are unfair, more Catch-22 is what you're hoping for when you buy this book. And that's not what you get. What you get are moments of grim amusement and boredom. The book is at its best only when its dealing with new characters that never appeared in Catch-22. The absurd sections fall flat, and the sections that are supposed to be hilarious are tired and seem like pale shadows of the ideas of Catch-22. The book works best, strangely, when its being realistic, but Heller seems scared to write the whole thing that way. Too bad. The sections dealing with Lew, his best friend, his wife, and the fire bombing of Dresden are the most effective and touching -- and add up to about 50 pages total."
2,Whimpers down,"I loved the way it started off. Revisiting the old characters from Catch-22. Led me to believe that it really could be sequeled.Then it squealed. Meandering meaninglessly, to fill a large volume"
2,"It's a sequel, but it's not the same","Catch-22 is a classic was satire, one of the best books ever written. Closing Time feels like a lame attempt to roll on Catch-22's success. Some of the old characters are back, but the style just isn't the same.If this book were released seperately from Catch-22, with all new characters, I might have given it three or maybe even four stars. Instead, the book has a ""kludged"" feel, almost as if it were written before deciding to make it a sequel to Catch-22. And unlike Catch-22, Closing Time incorporates fantasy elements which might break the suspension of disbelief if you're expecting the style of Catch-22."
1,Painful. Terrible. An absolute mess,"I just finished this book. Damn. What a mess. I think the title for my review says it all. Probably, one of the worst books I have ever read."
2,Should have left great alone,"Catch 22 was a stand alone great. It is unfortunate that Heller followed up with such a rickety tale. Hard to follow both the story and the logic (or lack there of he is so well known for). I was looking forward to a whiley novel in the vain of the original, and what I feel I got was a book written much like a reunion tour of a band whose best days were well past."
3,Small But Informative,"The thing that makes this book unusual is the inclusion of maps of where Sasquatch has been sighted. Not much new information will be found for anyone seriosuly interested in the Sasquatch. A small synopsis of the pros and cons about Sasquatch is included as well as a method of diecerning their tracks from those of bears as well as a list of sighting in California, Oregon, and Washington, including ""Jacko"", the only Sasquatch to ever have been captured. The small price is worth it for the maps, but there is really nothing new here."
1,Seasoned Bigfoot Readers: SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"I'll admit that this is a good ""book"" (pamphlet) for those just getting started in this subject.It contains the most popular stories, however, remember that if you are reading this... You are on the Internet! These stories can be easily obtained in fifteen minutes by typing ""Bigfoot"" into any search engine.Along with other quotes lifted from other (and better) writers on the subject, ie; John Green... It is plagarism at best.Sorry Dave, had to be honest!To the author's credit though, I have to say, the drawings are nice!"
2,ummmm.....,Very small collection of the most popular and previously recorded events. Save your $5 and try something else a bit more informative..like Dr. Krantz's Big Footprints or the old On The Track of Sasquatch.
5,Great Little Guide,"This is a great little guide: direct, to the point, and informative. Keep in mind at 48 pages (actually 24 front and back) is is brief to say the least. However, the information packed in those few pages follows the concrete, traditional, field guide design. The Guide To Listings at the end of the book, along with the great drawings and maps are well worth the price. The problem is, with shipping, you are paying way too much. Keep in mind, I think this is a wonderful book, but it amazes me that the cover price was originally $6.95. I happened upon this guide at a local used book store for $2.50, so I can truly say that I am in no way disappointed. There are far better, exhaustive, tomes on the topic, but as a quick read, this guide can't be beat. Recommended!"
4,A book to have with you when you 're in bigfoot country !,This book right here will show you the location of sightings and footprints. It give you some guide lines on finding bigfoot and comfirming your find.
5,Symbolism Lite,"A intellectual tour de force, ""Oreo"" is an amusing and stimulating read in the spirit of Joyce or Pynchon that does not require the heavy lifting demanded by those authors. It may have been overlooked when first published because, contrary to what was expected from a novel by a young Black author in the '70s, it did not promote a social cause."
2,Hard to follow and understand,"I heard a review for this book that said it was funny and a great read, but I found the writing style to be very hard to follow. There was too much unexplained jargon as well - I had been hoping to learn about Jewish and African American culture, but instead I was just confused."
2,Obnoxious,I was so excited to get this book - and then so disappointed. It seems to me that Ross just inserted every Yiddish word she could come up with. It was so obnoxious I couldn't get through it.
1,Barely worth $3,"I only wish I had purchased this used at $3 price range. It's filled with babble, not clearly explained with a metric ton of filler text. Avoid at all costs."
1,DISASTER!,"I bought router this a while ago and never hooked it up. After I bought a new Dell laptop, I decided to give it a try. WHAT A DISASTER! The ""CD that automatically detects and configures all necessary settings"" did not work. I spent over 60 minutes with tech support and even they could not help me set it up! Do yourself a favor - if the CD does not work RETURN the router or trash it immediately. The technical problems are a nightmare. Someone needs to sue these guys for what is claimed on the box.I can't believe one review that claimed they did not even need to run the setup CD to get it to work. That guy ought to play the lottery!I lost eight hours of my time. - Trash it."
2,major flaws,"As other reviewers have noted, the router is very easy to set up. However, it has two major flaws which would keep me from recommend this unit:1. The router randomly locks up several times a week. It requires a power off then on in order to start working again.2. The router times out idle TCP session after a few minutes, and there is no way to disable or change this timeout. After the timeout the connection is dropped and has to be re-established. This is a *major* annoyance for people like me who use ssh or telnet to log into outside machines, but it can also cause problems with chat clients or other network applications if you are idle for a few minutes. This behavior has been confirmed by Netgear tech support, and they don't have a solution.Between these two flaws, I recommend against buying this unit. Netgear's previous generation product (RP314) was rock solid, it's sad to see Netgear go so far downhill."
1,Very Unstable,"I've had this router for about 5 months and I am very unhappy with it. Every 2 or so days, it will just disconnect on me and not work. It also disconnects on a regular basis and almost every day, I have to unplug it and plug it back in. It was eventually very tiring after a while and I finally ordered a new one, today (on Amazon.com). If possible, please stay away from this router and choose something else!"
3,"What ""they"" don't tell you -","It's a great concept, connect up to four computers in your home, which is what I wanted. In the connecting phase, I find it only works with Windows 7 to Windows 7 computers, so if you want to share data with a computer using Windows XP, forget it."
3,Low price,"Nothing spectacular about this router but it works fine. It was fairly easy to set up but I had some problems with getting connected. I had to reset my modem a few times to get it set up correctly. I didn't have any problems with it shutting off or losing connectivity. This item was a good price, but I am upgrading to a wireless router now."
2,"Good start, horrible rest on...","I thought i was getting a bargain when i was purchasing this with SPI and NAT firewall for this price. Well it sounded too good to be true, which it was.At first it was flawless, had some bad ports that wouldnt open, than was losing the DHCP lease even after i assigned it my mac adress on the comcast account. On top of that, it will drop the lease every 1-2 days, which it shouldnt with MY MAC Address, and a power cycle every time. I hate power-cycling everytime i want it to work properly for another 1-2 days in order to repeat.I shoud of and now am going to push out the extra cash for a Linksys, which none of my friends or family have problems with, wireless or wired.It was good while it lasted though."
2,Very unstable,"This router WILL freeze if you use it for then just checking emails and browsing sites. If you have a network of at least computers (which is why you would buy a router) then it will freeze untill you restart it. I am a ""heavy"" user and some times have more then 1 download going and it constantly quits on me. You have to unplug and it plug it back in. Some times I have to do it 10-20 times a day which is extremely annoying. I can not imagine you can possible plug in 256 PCs (maximum load stated in their specs) to this router if it quits working with only 2. I would not recommend this router to anyone. I am selling mine. Anyone interested? :)"
1,Do not buy Netgear unless you're a masochist,"This router was a pain to install (definitely not plug and play) and the phone support was some of the surliest and ruddest I have experienced in a long while. I'm willing to overlook some bad service if the product is good (hello, can you tell I'm a Mac owner?) but this router sucks. It stalls all the time, and needs to be disconnected and reconnected at least twice a day. If I could give this no stars, I would."
2,You get what you pay for,"I purchased this unit because I had good experience with Netgear before they sold to Nortel. I was not happy with this product. My DSL connection seemed slightly sluggish compared to connecting directly to the DSL modem. I returned it and purchased the Linksys BEF41SX. I did not notice the subtle sluggishness. (I have a review under that product noting why this might be. It also comes with a firewall built into the router. And VPN endpoint.) However, for the price it's not so bad. I got it working quickly."
1,NETGEAR RP614 REVIEW,This product was unable to connect to the internet using a standard modem. I called my Optimum technical support team and they too were unable to get the router to connect to the internet. More or less I wasted my money.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"Not only is this an outdated router, it works horribly. We are on DSL and have two computers plugged in. We have no desire for wireless. This router needs to be reset three times a day by getting on the floor and plugging and unplugging it. We finally drove down to the store and bought a new current router Dlink brand for $40 and solved this problem. Its going into the trash tonight."
2,so-so,works sometimes for only an hour then have to reset by unpluging for 30 seconds.you get what you pay for did not pay much did not get much
1,Joe,"I just had to toss my Netgear RP 614 V4. It was the second one I had purchased. The first one kept conking out and needed to be reset by unplugging it for ""at least 30 seconds"" and then plugging it in again. It lasted about 6 months then I had to buy a new one.The second one I bought worked better than the first, but here I am after 9 months tossing it away. It will not work.These products are not very durable. I would rather pay a bit more for something that lasted longer.I would have to rate the quality as very poor while the utility of it was mediocre."
5,Don't know a thing about computers,Because of security my husband refuses to use wireless. I went to several places to find a replacement for our old router.. but everyone had wireless to include Best Buy. Amazon.com came to my rescue. It came within 5 days and I hooked it up with no problems. My husband travels out of country a great deal and the computer is my link to him. This little router was exactly what I needed. Thank you Amazon.com.. I always go to your site when I need something ASAP.
3,Worked great for 4 years,"This router gave me 4 years of trouble-free service, then it died. I only give it 3 stars because I am disappointed in its short service life."
1,Horrible product + horrible support,I purchased this router locally to replace a failing one. There is no web interface for set up and you must use the CD. The set up then will not give the computer a DHCP address or continue unless you give it internet access. I have set up a lot of routers in my day and never put one on a network before it's configured. I called the support number and was informed that there was no way to set up *any* router without internet access. After about 15 minutes of go around with Level 1 support I asked for Level 2 and got hung up on. It goes back tomorrow and I ordered a replacement router from Amazon. I would rather limp along for 2 or 3 days than be treated like that. BEWARE!
5,"Good Job, No Worries","I'm running a wired network with two, coming on three computers and I was very lucky to come across this very affordable, well conditioned product. Doesn't seem to be in the norm of the merchant, but good transaction nonetheless. 5 out of 5, two thumbs up, and upon any other unscientific method upon which we gauge our experiences, exemplary.Now Amazon will stop emailing me."
5,Netgear Router,"This little Wired Router was super easy to install. I had to purchase the Netgear brand because the Linksys quit working with with my ISP (Comcast).The price was right, the shipping right (free), and best of all...IT WORKS!!!! Double firewall is a bonus! Would recommend this to a friend in a heart beat."
1,Buyer beware,This is the most disappointing piece of Netgear equipment I have ever purhcased. I bought this to replace it's aging predecessor that required replacement. Over 2 hours of fooling around with it and I could not get it to work. I am very experienced and highly technical and thought I could figure it out but alas no. A quick google indicated that inability to obtain an IP address is not uncommon and often unresolvable. I gave up and picked up the equivalent Dlink product. The Dlink router was up and running in less than 15 minutes.
1,Didn't work,"Some 15-20 h over a 2-month period was spent trying to program this device and get it to connect to the internet through a separate modem. It never worked, even with downloaded instruction materials from Netgear website and a couple of phone calls and emails from tech staff who sincerely tried to help. Finally boxed the unit and sent back to Netgear. No response from Netgear since sending."
5,4 Port means 4 ports plus 1 uplink (actual 5 ports),"Got my Router, I already had all the wires laid out, first of all I was releaved to see that 4 port meant 4 ports plus an uplink, unlike old netgear hubs where 4 ports meant 3 plus uplink. Anyhow plugged it in, was about to put the cd in to run whatever software I needed and noticed that it was already running by itself. I have'nt tried running any of the fancy port forwarding stuff, unfortunately I still cant do file trasnfers with MSN messenger or windows messenger for XP (nor the fancy videos) I tried everything, I hope Microsoft fixes that. One feature I wish the router had was distributing bandwidth because now I got one person who runs p2p Kazaa and drains the life out of the rest of us. Overall no problems with the router itself. got it for 39.99 but still waiting for the rebate mail. Oh well, time will tell"
5,Netgear RP614 Router,Ordered this on a Thursday and received it the following Tuesday. I unpacked it and had it up and running in less than 15 minutes. It has worked flawlessly since I first turned it on.
5,A very good product,"This is an excellent product, easy to setup and at a very good price. I originally bought it for its security features: NAT plus SPI. About as good as you can get at keeping malware out short of never connecting to the internet. Since buying it, I've added another computer. Just plug one end of the cable into the router's port 2 and the other end into the computer's ethernet port and you are running. The initial setup apparently configures all four ports. It isn't wireless so your other computer(s) need to be close but the 15 foot cable works fine."
1,Worst router ever,I dislike netgear for several problems:1. It doesn't allow me to access yahoo or hotmail for weird reason.2. Bad customer service.3. Hard to configure.
2,Easy to install? hard to use?,"I was not impressed by this product and returned it the next day. The set up wizard didn't do any thing but show you where to plug in the cords...duh? The first computer that went in allowed me to access the router but not the internet. The instructions said to re boot and unplug power on the modem and router which I did. After that I was able to get to the internet but not the router. The second computer wouldn't access the internet either. After about 2 hours of this ""run in circles"" routine; I put the Linksys router back in and placed the Netgear back in the box.Re booting constantly is not a good network/routing system."
1,doesn't work with mediacom service,Spent an hour talking to tech help at mediacom. Then the guy went and looked up some stuff on the router and found out that the router does not work with mediacom service.
5,I love it!!!! SO EASY!,"I purchases a Linksys router, because I happen to have 5 laptops and two PCs. I got tired of switching cords. Well, it works like a charm, thought it was a pain to install and set up. EXCEPT, I could not download updates from Microsoft, I could not use Outlook Express with any hotmail accounts, I could not post messages in MSN groups. Well I do these things dozens of times a day. They help people responded with all sorts of stuff to do, but it NEVER WORKED. I needed to access those things, so after a period I GAVE UP.I ordered Netgear and WOW. In a matter of 5 minutes I had all all my computers on line at once, they accessed Microsoft update, they used Outlook no probs, and I was able to post in MSN. So real installation to speak of, not settings ISPs, nothing. Plugged it in and go...Boy, this is the way it SHOULD BE. I recommend Netgear over Linksys anytime!"
4,Good SOHO router.,Good little router. Perfect for a handful of computers and a couple of video game consoles.
1,"Sometimes, sometimes not, then not at all","So here's the thing, when I lived in Phoenix, and I had this certain cable internet provider, and it worked. Granted I had a bit of trouble getting it to work right off the bat. But, then it worked, and that was that.Then I move to Albuquerque, and this other cable internet provider, and I could not get it to work. I even called Netgear, and even though the guy on the line was very nice, and very helpful, it still wouldn't work!I finally went down to the store, and got myself a new router by a different manufacturer, and that one worked. <shrug>"
4,It works on both PocketPC and PC,"I use this card on my Audiovox Maestro. It works fine and makes PDA really powerful and having a lot of fun. Potability and mobility, that is really PDA should do. But without internet connection, the functions of PDA are really limited.Another great thing is it also works on laptops if you buy a PCMCIA to CompactFlash adapter (less than $10 anywhere). Netgear doesn't provide the driver of MA701 under Windows, but you can install MA401's driver for MA701. It works perfectly. If you have both laptop and pda, it will save a lot of money to buy another PC wireless card...Problem I have met: sometimes it (used on PDA) takes long time (more than 1 min) to get connection while the signal is weak. However no such problem if used on my laptop.Overall it is a good product and highly recommended."
2,No Pocket PC 2003 drivers,This card is extremely flaky with Windows Mobile 2003. Watch out... there aren't any drivers available (yet). Too bad because it's (relatively) inexpensive.
3,Works great - when it works,"Originally the product was great in my dell Axim, only problem I had was that there was no support for it with a few of the common network testing apps. No big deal, I could work around that, and I didn't need to do any wardriving anyway. My first card was great, great reception at both home and office. After about 3 months the card started acting strange, dropping onnections, then the device stopped recognizing it. Netgear replaced the card without any problems (I agree with the comment that Netgear tech support needs a few more English speaking reps). The second card worked great, no problems until now, about 2 and a half months later, and it is dropping the signal again. I can sit in one spot 15 feet from the AP and watch the signal vary between 0 and 100 percent. Very frustrating. I guess it's time to call support for another card."
1,broke and broke again,"I bought this card in early November, the first one quit working within a month, Netgear warrantied it, but now 3 and a half months later the new card is having the same problem. I expect it to quit working altogether soon. I know it is the card not my pda because I also have a CF GPS that has never given me a problem. I won't buy Netgear again when I replace this card."
2,Strange behavior,"First, I tried the card on my iPaq3955 at Starbucks T-Mobile Hotspot. It worked, but the connection dropped about every 3 minutes. Considering the T-Mobile policy (minimum charge of 20 minutes when I was testing it), it is not appropriate.Second, and the most disappointing, was testing with Netgear's FM-114P router/print server. The card catches the signal (I held the iPaq right next to the antenna), however, it was almost impossible to establish connection. The signal indicator was moving from 0% to 100%, but the link stayed at 0% all the time. The connection with laptop (with Netgear's PC card) was excellent all the time. It is strange because both products (the card and the router) are from the same manufacturer."
1,General weirdness after a a few days,"This switch was installed 9/12 with about 12 PCs and servers attached to it. It ran fine for about 10 months then general weirness on the network. The switch looked fine, but traffic to a standstill. No amount of shutting down or rebooting PCs and servers mattered. Device ping times would be fine, but HTTP and other traffic just basically stopped. Cycle the power and life is good again for about 3-5 days and it starts all over again. After 3 episodes of this, we moved to a Linksys and all problems have gone away never to return."
3,"works well, so far","Bought for and installed at customer premises. Works fine. It's a switch so there is nothing to set up. Nice that the power supply is internal, so there is no external power supply and chintzy DC power plug to worry about."
3,Netgear Switch,Access to the power and the network cables were on opposite sides of the box. I wanted access to the power and the network cables on the same side of the box in order to accomodate a neater installation of cables in a desktop arrangement. Accessing the cables from opposite sides of the box is good for rack mounted equipment but not for desktop equipment.
5,"A very, very good book","For anyone that would like to code C in Solaris, this is a book that is a must. Provides a very complete overview of 64bit coding, secure coding practices, a c library and more."
1,Plagiarism is bad,I would recommend Thomas E. Dickey's web page to anybody with open mind to decide on this issue.http://invisible-island.net/critique/APUE-SSP.htmlI would certainly not pass my English Composition classes if I would be paraphrasing that much from somebody's work without proper references.
2,Good Only Because,"The only reason this book is a good Unix systems book is because it is a nearly section by section rip of Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment by Stevens. If you have a choice between Teer's book or Stevens book you must take Stevens' book. Stevens' 2nd edition is much more comprehensive and contains important content that Teer's book lacks, such as threads."
5,Very Good Book for Crusty Sysadmins,"This book has been very helpful to me and will enhance my understanding of Unix and more specifically, Solaris.Before this book, I held the book, ""Unix Internals: A Systems Operations Handbook"" by Shaw and Shaw as the bible of figuring out the innards of Unix. Rich Teer's new book, ""Solaris Systems Programming,"" has taken that title and will now be my favorite Unix internals book.The book is well-written, thorough and has many examples. I wish Teer would have put in more details on threads programming, but I guess you can only go so far.I have recommended this book to almost all of my colleagues and will recommend it to anybody with any kind of programming background as a good reference for not only learning Unix systems programming, but learning Unix and how it works from a more detailed stand-point than the ""Intro"" books."
5,excellent source of solaris information in clear form,"This book is true bible of solaris knowledge and, what is importand too - written using very simply and clear language - that (unfortunately rare) property of technical book makes it very good and useful manual."
5,Critical Examination of the Fundamentals of US Government,"William E. Hudson has written an eloquent, insightful, and well-thought critique of the United States system of representative democracy. Hudson confronts the challenges to American democracy raised by campaign finance, the media, radical individualism, and the national security state. Hudson does not shy away from full fledged confrontation with the complacent stereotypes of American politics; instead, he utilizes his sharp wit and insight to cut through the layers of tacit consent which usually shield and protect our system of government to write a book about government as it really is. In an era when understandings about government are shrouded in assumptions and soporifisms, Hudson peels back the layers to expose the American political system and the central problems it carries with it."
2,Title Correct,"This book is scarey. I read it to find out what they are teaching our kids. It was assigned reading. It advocates the abandondment of our constitutional system of checks and balances that has made us the greatest nation on earth. ""Our eighteen-century Constitution has become a major obstacle to achieving democratic government in the twenty-first century"" (pg34) - really? The author would prefer a socialist state. The radical left, running our schools, love it and teach this garbage. Why is it one is considered a right wing extremist to want to defend our constitution and have it taught to our kids? He makes broad accusations with no data to back up his statements: ""During this period, most Americans were clearly dissatisfied......"" (pg47) This is a two star only because it is well written and a window for us all to see the ultimate liberal agenda."
3,"Warm, comfy, but not Chincilla","This is faux chincilla and it runs small. I wear a 9.5 and I have turned it into a mule just by wearing it, so I would order a size up. Like the color and comfort. Good company-Footsmart."
4,Nice Quality !,"I bought a pair of these for the wife and she really likes them. Soft, well made, comfortable. She has owned other pairs of Acorn slippers before and they always serve her well. Recommended !"
5,great slipper!,This is the fifth pair of these slippers I have bought between my daughter and myself. They are warm and toasty and slip on and off easily. They are almost indestructible but I like to have my choice of colors since we only wear slippers in the house. Would highly recommend especially if you have cold feet because they are definitely very warm.
5,The evil Skorth,"This book was great but it would be scary for little kids. I recommend this book for kids 5-12. In every Droon book, Eric, Neal, and Julie visit the land of Droon. In this book, evil Lord Sparr puts Princess Keeah in a trance. The kids have to go to the Land of the Lost to save Keeah and keep Sparr from the Golden Wasp. Sparr wants to use the Wasp to take over Droon. The Land of the Lost is home of Droon's good dead heroes. Sparr takes Keeah out of the trance but puts her in a maze. The kids get her out. From a box, Sparr unleashes the evil Skorth. The evil Skorth are the evil Droon dead. There is a big battle. The Droon heroes win but Sparr gets the Wasp. I recommend this story because it is exciting."
4,this is an ok book,this is an ok book it is a good book for bookreports it is easy to read and you can read it quick it is a good book for kids that don't like to read but if you do like to read like my self It can work out ok I anm a book lover and love to write storys but repeorts aren't my thing so that is y I read this book thanks Rissy for letting me get an easy book for miss hooper and by the way you r da bomb!
5,Excellent,"Great photography. Not much more needs to be said. If you know who these photographers are, you would not be basing your decision to purchase on opinions of strangers, and would just buy the damn thing already."
3,Great photojournalism - not one for the coffee table,"This is one of the best pieces of photojournalism available on the beginning of the Second Gulf War. However, that fact makes this book hard to revisit. It has sat on my shelf ever since I first sat down to examine it pages."
2,there are better ones out there,"Maybe because its 2 main ingredients are water and alcohol, this gel leaves my naturally wavy hair helplessly frizzy. In the beginning I thought I was not using enough product so I slathered up on my hair section by section. It left my hair stiff like any other hair gel would. If I have to pay $22, I expect the product to work much better than my $3 Herbal Essence Totally Twisted Gel. This Ouidad gel is a disappointment. It doesn't do any ""quenching"" thing and it doesn't even define curls as well as a drugstore product. I get much better result with the Totally Twisted Gel with less amount of gel. I'm giving it 2 stars because it doesn't make my hair any worse. It just doesn't do anything for my hair."
4,Like it,"I like the Curl Quencher Gel. It makes my curls come out and leaves the frizz free. Just don't use to much, it will make you hair hard."
3,No thanks!,"I have dry, course, wavy/curly hair. I normally use Sebastian Potion #9 (awesome!), but thought I would try this for a change. It seemed to dry out my hair, and did not help the curls form. It did nothing for me. I think it might be better suited for someone with normal, soft hair with curls that needs just a lightweight gel-type styling aid."
1,as much fun as gouging out my eyes with a shrimp fork,"according to ubi the game has ""An intricate new combat system that lets you wage battles with no boundaries. Manipulate the environment and the enemies themselves to develop your own unique fighting style."" Unfortunately this is not true. The game is a console game that was just switched to pc with no thought. There is no mouse look in this game, which means that the game is completely linear. You can only move where the game lets you and are not able to turn the character 360 degrees. The whole point of pc games is that you have more freedom with the characters than on consoles, plus better graphics. This game has neither. It is a shame because it seemed like a cool game, but I uninstalled it 10 minutes after installing it because it was a pain to play."
4,Prince of Persia 2,"If you played the first game,you probubly want the sequal. In the first game the unnamed prince seemed a little bratty, but in Prince of Persia 2 he has a whole new attitude. He's now alot more serious than before. The graphics in this game are very detailed. His new fighting moves are as amazing as the rest of the game. The story is my favorite part of the game. Since the prince has been rewinding time and coming back to life so many times in the first game, his main enemy is a representation of destiny itself. Because he has cheated death so many times before, he must go through the disastrous underworld. I cant wait to own this game and I hope this review makes you want it too."
3,Sticky tricky but fun,"I am very close to calling the ubisoft folk genius,however they are very flawed in areas of this game.First off i really enjoyed this game yes the controls suck as i often found myself leaping in the wrong direction and screaming all manner of interesting words at the screen.One thing that really pissed me off was the music.Here they have gone to all the time and effort to create this beautiful magical world only to have death metal guitars crapping all over it.If they did their homework they would find that a lot of middle eastern styles of music are really interesting and heart pounding.I turned off the music after 5 mins problem solved.Anyway it looks great and it will certainly test you."
5,awesome book,"This book should be an absolute must for every married couple. midlife crisis will happen to all men to some degree, and women, you need to be prepared for it. Out of ten other books I have read on the subject, this one stands out way ahead of the others. This might end up in gifts for weddings of friends of mine!!"
3,Misery enjoys company.,"Nice to know others are going through this, but the information in the book becomes repetitive halfway through. Did not finish reading the entire book--became grueling. Last half of the book centers on extra-marital affairs, flings, etc., which I am not interested in."
2,Book is useful only for a very specific population segment.,"Jim Conway's ""Men in Midlife Crisis"" identifies many of the emotional buttons and life areas that men actually *in* midlife crisis are dealing with: aging, family and work responsibilities, and the emotional and psychological difficulties of these things. Unfortunately, the book has a single ""answer"" for each area and every problem: look to the Christian God. If the reader is a Christian and has done only little thinking about his current life dilemma, then this book may be mildly helpful, as it allows the reader to know that he is not alone and that his faith may help ease the pain he is feeling at this period in his life. However, if the reader is *not* a Christian, or is looking for discussion and suggestions beyond the obvious and beyond the faith-based, then he needs to keep looking--this book will provide neither comfort nor help."
5,Extremely helpful!,"Reading this book was like reading a blueprint of my husband's trek through the 40s. Unfortunately I read the book AFTER the fact... after the affairs, after the conflict, etc. Now that we are rebuilding our marriage this book has given me the perspective I need to work at understanding the WHY of what happened. If I could, I would buy it for every wife on her husband's 40th birthday."
5,A must-read for both men and women!,"""Men in Midlife Crisis"" goes the farthest of anything I've read in explaining the mid-life crisis. It not only describes how and when it happens, but provides insight into dealing with it successfully. It also addresses the woman's midlife crisis, as well as the later stages of life. This book is invaluable to anyone struggling with the pain caused by a man's midlife crisis."
2,My Opinion,"This book wasn't in the condition the seller described; the cover was torn. Again, the content wasn't particularly helpful to me. Sorry."
4,nice big pieces,"My family insists on the relatively larger pieces in a 300-piece puzzle. These are not the big clunky ones in children's puzzles but neither are they the nasty tiny things that get lost in a short shag carpet if you drop them. I like this line of puzzles for size of puzzle, pieces, and they take enough effort but not too long for a wiggly grandson or arthritic grandma."
1,Dead after 3 mo. no Netgear support,Died after 3 mo. All lights come on and stay on. Netgear support was kind enought to tell me it was dead and I needed to go buy a new switch. Have very hard time signing into Netgear site to get any additional. They appear to not be offering any warranty.
2,Nifty little unit - too bad it doesn't seem to work...,"I tried placing this unit behind my Microsoft MN700 wireless router (which sits behind my cable modem). I have a single cat5 run to the far side of my house, and I wanted to add this unit to that drop so I could have two devices connected in that end of the house. Well, unfortunately, the unit seems to drop the connections every 2 minutes for abou 10 seconds. It will do this for hours, and I have not been able to resolve the problem with new patch cables or rebooting PCs, power cycling the unit, etc.Very frustrating..."
4,Great!!,"This is a great switch, it does the Job, but actually there are some really good offers for wireless routers for around the price of this switch."
1,Netgear Switch Unmanaged,"Had for about 2 1/2 yrs. It go haywired last night, flashing LEDs unable to reset. No reset button, unplugged all CAT cables and power supply, with different power outlet with no avail. Never knew an unmanaged Switch can malfunction unoperaterable. 4th product from Netgear made, didn't last from 3mos to 2 1/2yr; however, this switch has lasted the longest. Will stay away from all Netgear's product from now."
1,Their products have no warranty,"Contrary to their claims, their products have no warranty at all (unless you pay for it). I have a 2 year old gateway router that had a 5 year warranty that stopped working one day so I called their tech support. The tech support person told me that since the product is over 90 days old and they do not manufacture it anymore, then I would have to contact their pay tech support line to get an RMA. If they are able to fix the problem over the phone line, then they will charge me, otherwise they will offer me an RMA number for a return. So basically you have to pay to use their warranty. A friend who is a lawyer is currently handling this situation."
3,Need the router 2...,"It's supposed to come with a router to,which they don't tell you,useless without it. Haven't used it and the set up cd it comes with is for the router they didn't send you,nice."
1,Image different than actual product,"Another user posted the correct image of this product which is the silver plastic netgear router, not the blue metal one.This rating is only to let people know about the discrepency and that the item description says you'll get a ""Sleek, silver unit"", not the one pictured here."
1,Incomplete description led to much disappointment,"This is only an adapter of sorts, it does not actually rout signal. So, one must have their high-speed modem connect to another box and then that box can connect to this. Based on its functionality, it is not worth it. I see products similar to this for under $[...] at major electronics suppliers. Amazon, of course, is great as they accepted it back easily! That's why I only buy items that [...] sells themselves.One of the downfalls of user-defined tags is the fact that I did a search for a router and got this product."
5,fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine,"its works just fine, do not overheat, in fact its no hot when you touch it, looks nice over my desk. im very happy with this product"
5,Works great,When you review a switch either it works or it does not. I have the Netgeat FS605 installed two switches down stream from my cable modem and it works without a hitch. The next issues with a switch is noise and heat. In these categories the netgear FS605 is awesome. It is operating 24 hours a day and cool to the touch. Best of all I cannot hear anything when it is turned on. I have some netgear switches with fans that let you know when they are on. Not this one. Great for the home theatre area where you want quite. I use it to pass the ethernet from my playstation to my server that uses QCast to play avi on my TV. Netgear FS605 is a keeper.
5,Excellent Ethernet Switch,I tried using a D-Link router with my Direcway/Hughes satellite Internet connection with absolutely no success. With that connection the only thing that will work is a hub or switch. A switch is more advanced because it is able to feed all the outputs with fast connections instead of having to share the input as a hub does.The Netgear FS605 (which currently has a $10 rebate) is very simple to set up since all it really does take an input and feed it to everything else. No IP addresses of Ethernet names are required. The enclosed paper Installation Guide estimates the setup time to be 5-10 minutes and that's about right. No problems whatsoever.I would recommend this to anyone having satellite Internet.
5,Wonderful little device!,"Absolutely plug-n-play. No set-up required. I have had to unplug and plug it in again after moving devices around but not a problem. Makes my life so much easier. Yes, you can probably buy a router but they are not the same thing. If you just want to be able to plug multiple devices into one network connection, this is the thing. I have my computer and a LinkStation server, with a printer on the server, working seamlessly on this switch. For a while I even had a wireless router on it, at the same time. If I have to plug in a laptop briefly, no problem, I just use a short cable and plug into the switch. Saves me crawling around unplugging and plugging stuff in. I couldn't be happier. I hope it lasts a very long time."
5,great switch,I bought two of these and use them both a lot. They work well and have a sleek compact design.
5,Netgear fs605na gotta love it,"Within 7 minutes, it was and is (one month later)working flawlessly. I love the front lights and it tells you when one of your computers is active on the network. I wish all comm devices were this foolproof. Price was right and Amazon shipped very quickly. Would buy this item again."
5,"I own three of these, plus one of the Gigabit version",These switches just work and the price cannot be beat. I have alot of networked devices in my house so I have three of these and one of the Gigabit version. They are truly plug and play and couldn't be easier to install and use.
4,Easy to setup/install and work well,"Setup was very straight forward and has been working with no problems for a few weeks now. The power adapter is a little big & chunky, takes space on the powerstrip, i wish they would make it a little smaller."
3,slipin & sliding,"This product is OK, but will not buy again. It is just too greasy feeling after being applied. I was afraid to touch anything as I would leave an imprint of my finger. It seems that it takes forever to be absorbed into the body. Perhaps it is because I'm a young-old lady and too much in a hurry to get on with things. However, the aroma from it is lovely. Delivery was very prompt as usual from Amazon."
4,From KKK member to the Supreme Court: A fascinating story,"What more can you say to attract a reader than this book is the story of a southern lawyer who begins as a member of the Ku Klax Klan in Alabama and ends his career as one of the most respected members of the United States Supreme Court. WOW! The truth IS stranger than fiction.This book was written by one of Justice Black's former law clerks on the Court. It is well-written and gives great insight into the man, his methods, convictions, passions, and flaws.Highly recommended for those who are fans of the Court's jurisprudence during the era of expanding protection of individual rights."
1,Think before buying this one...,"The ""new"" planes were horrid. Several wouldn't work out of the box(Abacus finally put out a patch months later). I was unable to get the runway lights to work at Sky Ranch and Abacus was of no help!"
3,Not for those who can still hear high frequencies,"Hub has been functionally great for a couple of years now. However now that I work near it (new office set up) I've noticed it emits a high pitched sound as traffic passes through it. It's becoming obnoxious enough that I think I'll just replace it with a gigabit switch (something I've been wanting to do anyway). I've read similar reports of a high frequency noise in other reviews too, but maybe Netgear has fixed this issue in more recent builds."
1,Quit working in six months,"I have this switch behind a DSL modem. Since DSL speed is only 8Mb/s, the 10/100 speed is plenty. The unit is nice looking and running cool.However, it suddently stopped sending traffic through it today, even all the lights are working fine. I powered down all the computers and reboot DSL modem many times, could not find anything wrong -- until I replaced this switch with another one.I don't know what was wrong with it. All lights work fine. when a cable plugged in, the ports lighting up fine. But no traffic passing through. I was hoping if it died, at least the light also off, so that I could know it is this switch's fault."
2,Don't use it in your basement,"This thing worked fine for about nine months and then died. It doesn't like humidity. I keep my switch and router in my basement. Like many basements, it's a bit damp, though I have a dehumidifier running all the time. It's not that damp in there, but the switch just died on me.I'd question the power supply or some other factor but my router and DSL modem have never had any problems at all and this is the second Netgear switch I've owned that has gone kaput; my best guess is dampness."
2,Not Reliable,This thing failed a month after it went out of warranty. I bought two other D-Link and they're still working perfect.
5,Good but go with the Gigabit switch instead...,This is a good little desktop switch but I'd recommend their Gigabit switch instead if you can spend just a little bit more. The gig switch offers more bang for the buck as long as you're using gigabit adapters and cables with it (which I am).
3,overload overload,"what is the point of having 8 ports when 5 computers overloads it!!!!the one i received is not the stylish one either, i received the older model which looks dull."
5,totally rulz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"pretty fly for a white guy is one of the best songs i have ever heard, and it has to be my all-time favorite video!"
2,Poor quality.,"I am not sure whether they are made in China, while I assure you even in China I have never seen set in this poor quality."
1,Very low quality.,"When I saw this in person, I just tossed the bedding aside to donate to charity. For $9.99 and prime shipping, incurring any additional costs to return the item wouldn't be smart. The pattern is ugly, which you can see in the picture, but the quality is low-grade, pay-by-the-hour motel. If that's the look you are going for, buy this set."
5,my daughters LOVES Bella,"I reviewed the DVD too because my VCR ate my daughters tape and she was so inconsolable that I had to go out and buy the DVD...I thought she'd never calm down. It is her favorite toy in our house and has been for the last 4 months. my daughter LOVESSSS this video! She can't get enough of it and it has really taught her to dance. However, the shoes are horrible - I bought real ones for $20 and put the pink ones it came with in her dress up box in case a friend comes over for a playdate. If you can get real tap shoes, than I HIGHLY recommend this video.After her meltdown from the video disaster I had to give it 5 stars."
3,Tap Shoes wouldn't stay on for anything!,My 4 year old loves Bella Dancerella and we thought that the tap dancing video would be a great idea for her to learn the basics.She loved the video and could follow it perfectly but the shoes kept coming off no matter what we did to them.Even when put on the right way every time they came off every five minutes. The tap shoes aren't really designed well enough to keep up with the steps required for the video instructions.So...we ended up buying her some real tap shoes to go with the video and that works best!
4,"A very good product, but the VPN is difficult for those with no patience.","I have 4 FVS318 (2) v.1, (1) v.2, (1)v.3. I have never had any problem with these routers ever. I use PPPOE and static IP address. They are very stable and are physically durable. My connection is below 5MB, so I cannot attest to any speed problem.The VPN can be difficult, but Netgear has documentation to solve this. The problem, is rushing through the set-up. I find that you need be calm and completely forget what you know (or think you know) and follow line-by-line, like an idiot (VPN for dummies), and take the baby steps with Netgear help documentation.Then it will work! And it will work well.I have used the (2) v.1 since they came out several years ago. It was one of the first (cheaper) router with SPI."
2,What version is Amazon Selling now?,"V3 is good, and V1 is Bad. Hopefully by now they are only selling V3 and have not updated the product description..."
1,Agree... Speed STINKS!,"I had four of theese units in place and they all got replaced by the FVS338. The main reason is the speed. I have a lab and we tested the max Internet throughput of the FVS318's at 1.2Mbps! This is unacceptable. Oh yes, this is with the latest firmware.Several calls to customer service left me infuriated at the lack of comprehension of the problem. I contacted their legal deptartment the same day. Several promises were made on Netgears part wich resulted in them having another level 1 tech call me again to insist I reinstall my OS!I have successfully sued to get my money back.With all of my venting done, I would like to say that I am still a fan of the Prosafe line and will continue to use it. But Netgear be warned, I will be all over you until you get this product line properly supported."
2,Not happy....,"I have used the FVS318 for about 4 years now. I was hit by lightening and blew out one router on my VPN. I bought a new one to replace it and found that the new V3 is not backward compatible with the older versions. I had to totally reconfigure the unit and purchase another one to replace the older unit that DID work. Netgear also has posted on their website that they will in no way pay or discount the purchase of a new router due to the lack of backward compatibility. I would suggest going away from this router and possibly going away from netgear. I have been a huge netgear fan in the past, but... I recently replaced my personal wireless router with a Linksys."
1,BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!!,"This router may appear to work fine, but I assure you it is a momentary occurrence. It will spontaneously reboot, interrupting your connection, eventually completely preventing any connection as it cycles through a reboot process continuously. Sometimes this will happen immediately, sometimes after a year or two of working perfectly. Netgear will send you a replacement router if the hardware doesn't work (which is what this problem is). However, they can send you one that has the same problem, since this issue has never been fixed by them. Before you consider, do a web search of this model and ""spontaneous reboot"" you'll see many have had this problem, and the final resolution seems to be purchasing a competitor's router. Save yourself the aggravation. Not to mention the aggravation of an inept and unreliable tech support staff based in India."
2,Requires some expertise to administer,"Some knowledge of networking concepts is required to properly administer the Netgear FVS318 VPN router, particularly when paired with a Motorola Surfboard cable modem.The FVS318 is unable to pull new IP leases on its own when set to DHCP (which is the common set-up for most home users). Every 3-5 days, the user must manually release and renew the router's IP from their cable-ISP. While this is not particularly a difficult task, it is a tedious task which, in a perfect world, should not be necessary.Current firmware upgrades (as of June, 2005) do not address this issue."
1,"This is Version 2, Not 3","I bought this for the hardware firewall. I got version 2, not 3. Amazon and (Amazon vendor) J&R; listings did not indicate version.I use it for two networked PC's and the firewall: no more, no less."
2,Decent product but has some challenges,Purchased this device with another Netgear device(same type just with wireless) to perform a site to site vpn as well as manage my network. I had some stability issues with this device as well as the VPN would almost always drop. Most of the time I had recycle the device to get it back. I eventually had to replace these devices as they where not meeting my needs. I had contacted netgear support there response was to reapply the same firmware and test again. Eventually gave up and purchased Zywall's to replace these and am extremely pleased with them.
3,Good product - but this is the older model!,"When I bought this product three months ago, I did not realize it was limited in it's throughput. I have a cable modem that runs at 25Mbps, but this unit is limited to 5Mbps.This information was not clear in the product write up. After I called NetGear tech support, they recommended I purchase the FVS318G model which is rated at 25Mbps.I was able to configure port routing, multiple a wireless access points through this router. However, you do have to be a tech expert to configure this device.The logs on the device are mostly useless, because the device does not have an ability to set it's internal clock. So all the logs start 2000-01-01. Since I rarely look at the logs, this doesn't bother me so much.One feature that I miss from this router is the ability to limit access on a per mac address level based on a schedule."
2,OK for LOW speed broadband connections,"Bought this to replace a similar D-Link unit which died completely. This is for a home/office setting where we needed more than the usual 4 ports.Set-up was a breeze, good ""quick start"" card, on-screen configuration excellent, unit is nice-looking and appears to be well made (metal case). FWIW, made in China. VPN not needed by us, so not tested nor configured.Unfortunately, it's not fast enough to handle even our 8 meg cable modem. Fastest throughput we ever got was 6.5, and usually less than 5 megs. We know it's not the computers since we VERY consistently got 8.0 - 8.1 with the previous router. I've seen this limitation mentioned in other reviews. For the record, we have the latest (as of this date) ""v3"" version (FVS318v3).If you have a slower broadband connection (maybe less than 4 megs??), this unit is probably fine... but for anything faster, it just can't do the job. Ours is going back."
2,But the big flaw is low throughput,"Most reviews don't seem to mention a key spec - the throughput of a firewall. I just upgraded my cable connection to the new (up to) 30Mbs plan and bought an FSV318v3 firewall to use with it. Without the firewall in place, I measured about 25Mbs download speed. When I installed the firewall in between the modem and one computer, download speed went down to 6.5Mbs. I also discovered that if the ""enable keyword blocking"" checkbox is enabled, the throughput went down to 5Mbs, EVEN IF THERE WERE NO KEYWORDS!This firewall is useless if you have a high-speed connection."
2,A good router/firewall: bad VPN,"If you want a good router that is easy to configure, this is a good purchase. If you are looking for a VPN router, by a SonicWall. I wish I had.I have 5 yrs exp as a intermidate network tech and 11 yrs as a software engineer. I've used a SonicWall before on a 10 server LAN while I was an employee, but wanted to save money for my new company when setting up a VPN for my home-to-office use. I have 2 of this model and I have never got the VPN to work. Called support, they couldn't get it to work, even though I gave them full remote control of both of my Netgear units! Then I knew it was not my fault...The saying ""you get what you pay for"" applies here. Some people with more time and experience may be able to get it to work, but if you're anything like me (a consultant), time is not cheap and I didn't have a few days to spend on it (even though I spent a week on it)."
3,"Everythings not included, expect to pay more","Box is misleading, although you can support 8 VPN clients the client software is extra. Expect to pay another $45 for one license and $130 for five. Input a complex password; ended up getting locked out several times, have to reset w/ a button on the switch and reconfigure. Letters and numbers work fine. So far the rest seems good. Should protect your always on connections."
2,Netgear FVS318 ProSafe VPN Firewall with 8 ports,"This unit was easy to purchase but very difficult to work with, not user-friendly. Initially, I called Netgear tech support to get it configured to my online broadband modem as there is no software CD to do this. The support was not pleasant, way too techy for me to understand. Having said this, months later we also had to disconnect all our devices and move them. Now there is NO tech support, except if we pay a huge fee!so we bought a Linksys that has user-friendly software and voila! We are online!"
1,It is slow.,"With Netgear Prosafe VPN Firewall 8 FVS318 I get about 6 Mb/s download, using my computers firewall I get about 17 Mb/s download. Using ShieldsUP! as a test both pass. The FVS318 is only 10/100 that may be the problem or it may just be slow. I'm not going to use the FVS318."
2,God help you (netgear won't),"My experience with tech support has been the worst BY FAR in 20 years of computing. The 2 techs i dealt with were remarkably incompetent, responding after days at a time with irrelevant cut and paste instructions. i'm not even sure that a real human responded, it may have been a computer response gleening information from the text of my message.i finally paid a guy to solve the problem that could have been easily handled by a competent tech support person.I can't say how frustrating this has been. but i guess you get what you pay for in this world. the router is functioning now, no problems in 2 weeks. but now i am attepting to set up a vpn connection which hasnt worked... i am not even going to try and contact netgear. my relationship with netgear is OVER....i'll never buy one again. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
4,Netgear FVS318,"Works great. Has many features and low cost. Only limitation is that the WAN to Lan speed can only go up to 6MPS, my FIOS connection is 20MPS, so big downloads and when things get busy cannot acheive enough speed. Will purchase newer model in a few months that can will work, and use this as a backup and possibly a normal switch."
2,Installation a snap!,"Problems with the device itself, though.Perhaps Amazon has a bad batch of these routers?After returning one (a great experience, by the way) and getting my 2nd, Netgear recommended I get a third because the routers wouldn't hold a connex. Amazon would not send a third, but offered a gift. cert. for my trouble. Now I'm without one.. Perhaps looking for another source."
3,Not compatable with cisco VPN,Unfortunately I had to return because I use the Cisco VPN at work and needed this to be compatible. It was very easy to set up but I had to uninstall the VPN client when I need to run my Cisco VPN client and then reeninstall the Netgear VPN client when I want to run it.
4,Most of best earliest songs of Hombre G,"Great CD, with most of best earliest songs of Hombre G. I like the best ""Lawrence de Arabia""."
1,Don't Buy Sight Unseen,"I live in a house that needs to be remodeled. Given the title of this book, I thought it would contain helpful information. Big mistake! The book consists primarily of non-U.S. structures and has no information on the ubiquitous ranch houses that make up a large percentage of the U.S. housing stock. There are no before and after photos, no general principles to follow regarding remodeling, in fact, no information I found useful at all except a good two page dictionary of terms (many of which are English) in the back.If I'd seen this book in the library and taken a few minutes to peruse it, I'd have replaced it on the shelf."
4,Worth your while...,"For a chick lit story in the first person, this was a pretty decent read. I'd gotten spoiled by Billerbeck's and Baer's excellent use of the first person, so Emily Ever After didn't turn me on very much in regards to the authors' style and voice at first, but once I got started on the story, I became quite engrossed. I'm glad Emily made mostly wise choices. And when she made bad ones, she reaped the natural consequences. I enjoyed experiencing some of those lessons with her. Emily's attitude was so honest and her flaws so human, that I couldn't help liking her and wanting to see her do well in life and have a happy ever after ending. Overall, this was a pleasurable experience for me. I think the attempts by Bennett to manipulate her was very realistic, and that Jacob was a real Godsend for her. I'd like to see another book by these ladies. Like maybe an Emily Ever After II. :)"
1,Awful,"If I could have given this less than one star I would have. Having lived in New York for some time, it was painful to read this ridiculous story where the character seems to think no one else around her is Christian or can believe in God if they are not Christian. They make NYC out to be a godless place but I have found so many people, be them Muslim, Jewish, Christian or otherwise that have VERY strong faith. I happen to be Christian and do not mind a book that can weave in religious views but this book was painful.The book was poorly written, character development was weak and the main character's judgment of people and constant ""holier than thou"" attitude that seemed to only rest on the fact that she would not have sex was irritating. She judged almost everyone in the book that she came across as good or bad solely based on whether they were Christian or not. It was irritating to read and gives Christianity a bad name.Do not bother to read this boring and poorly written book."
1,Unbelievably bad,"Completely unrealistic. Boring, poor writing. A story about a naive little girl, written by (I suspect) TWO naive little girls.I'm angry because this book does NOT mention it's a Christian book in the summary or on the cover. I am not Christian, and I certainly would not have bought it if I had known."
1,creepy religious moralizing + chick lit = yuck,"I actually enjoyed some of this fluffy chick lit story. But the preachy, holier-than-thou, ignorant moralizing was terrible. ""Don't publish a book I don't agree with! People will be misled,"" says one of the characters. This book was scary in its desire to regulate printed matter so that it confirm to ""Christian"" beliefs. Yuck."
1,Like preachy Christian books? Then this book is for you!,"I stopped reading this book after the first couple of chapters. I kept hoping that the obvious Christianity plugs would cease but they never did. The back cover never alerted me to the obvious Christian bias.Very early on the book has a cafeteria scene that makes it appear that Christians are somehow suffering socially by calling a Christian character a ""goody-goody"". That couldn't be further from the truth in the U.S.Then another character, a missionary, explains his hardship on trying to brainwash the spiritual minds of the homeless by confessing that he has trouble trying to express the true meaning of his giving. He gives because he wants to spread his religion, not merely because he is a good person. It's offensive to me to have religion forced in any capacity on the poor and the weak.This book (what I could stand reading) was terrible."
1,one star is one too many,"Horrible book! It makes me want to go out and punch a Christian. I wouldn't have finished it, but I'm not a quitter. It made all Christians look self righteous and stupid. Jacob doesn't want to date a girl because she's a bartender! Maybe she doesn't want to date someone who is always looking down at her."
2,Not sure...,"My mom baught me this book because it has my name on the cover. I wasn't expecting this to be a religious book, and while I do consider myself a Christian, I was really surprised with how conservative it is. At one point, the main character informs a friend that he is ""lowering his standards"" by dating a bartender. I'm sorry, but is that particular job un-Christian? I don't know, it wasn't a terrible book, but I thought some of the opinions in it are very narrow-minded and naive. I'm only 17 and I feel like I'm more grown up than Emily in the book."
2,Falls short in so many ways....,"Hi - I am a twenty-something and I am a Christian. I really enjoy ""clean"" chick-lit books - Christian or not. However, this book had so much potential and yet fall so short of it all. I kept reading this book hoping it would get better and it never does. Emily just never gets it - she doesn't grow or mature in any way. In fact I think she immatures more than matures in this book. She lives a very self-centered life and never grows beyond that.2 stars for the supporting characters in the book, which I like far better than Emily. I enjoyed her boss, childhood girlfriend, and uncle the best.Overall, a very disappointing read - don't waste your time instead...If you are looking for good, clean, and entertaining chick-lit -check out author Kristin Billerbeck in her Ashley Stockingdale 3 book series. Very fun and enjoyable."
3,Not Christian...,"I'm not a Christian, But I do enjoy reading all kinds of chick lit. This is my first Christian chick lit book I've read. I thought it looked cute and decided to give it a try.Overall it was pretty good. It lacked something. Maybe a better plot? Maybe more romance? I don't know the Christian things, but I'm pretty sure they do have romance without having to have sex or fool around. This book didn't have any. I would have like to see more. I would have liked to see more oof Emily's struggle making in a big city. She unrealistically fit right in and made friends the first day there. That wouldn't happen in the real world.This book wasn't anything 'special'. If you must read it, go ahead. But don't say I didn't warn you."
1,WORST FREAKING BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE,"OK, so she's ""Christian"" (because she says so in EVERY OTHER LINE, OR MAYBE EVERY LINE.) But honestly, if the authors wanted to ""spread their faith"" or whatever, they failed. They actually trashed the religion. No way a real Christian acts like her. ""OMG I LOVE HIM BC HE'S CHRISTIAN"" and you know what? he was a total JERK and so was she. So cheers to the worst book I have ever read in my life. Oh yeah, don't buy it. It sucks. I can't believe the publishers agreed to publish this."
1,Emily NEVER after,"Firstly, it took two poeple to write this uninspiring book? Nowhere on the back does it state this is a Christian Chick Lit book.Basically I cannot finish this book because the character is such a dork. One of the authors graduated from Baylor, so that explains the Christian theme, but come on! Drinking is not a sin! I guess my Catholic alcohol infused upbringng just can't relate to teetotaling Baptist types. I'll pass, now hand me a glass of wine... I'm moving on to read Smashed instead."
4,"Good, But Consider Lilly is Better","I truly enjoyed this book, but their second book is better. While I agree that I would like Emily to be a little more ""forceful"" in the book, I believe it truly depicts some of the struggles a young, Christian woman would have in NYC. I found it funny and inspiring. I would recommend it as a gift for any young, Christian woman who is going off to college or life after college. Asks some good questions, that are not always easy to answer!"
1,Awful and seriously cliched,I am a Christian 20-something woman living in NYC and O MY GOSH this book is awful! The cliches are just too much. The book takes Christian ideas and goes too far with them to where they just look silly. I could barely finish it. I would say this is much more young-adult-reader than actually-adult-reader.
5,Relatable...maybe PG-21 for Christian women?!,"Emily's struggles with keeping her morals in the city & her adventures being away from home for the first time were relatable. I would definitely recommend it to any young professional woman...but probably not anyone still in a collegiate setting confined with hormone enraged boys. It's definitely not ""Little House on the Prairie"" wholesome, but Emily goes through the same struggles myself & most of my friends have when faced with being a minority as a Christian for the first time. A real page turner. I struggled with the first chapter - getting use to writing style - but stick with it & you won't be able to put it down. I look forward to reading it again after I read ""Consider Lily""."
1,Painful to read,"I agree with several other reviews that in parts the main character was actually witty and funny, however, for the most part I had to force myself to finish this book for several reasons:1. I had no idea that the book was about who used the word ""Christian"" in every other sentence. The cover should really let people know this is what they are getting when they purchase this book.2. The people who are supposedly Christian in the this book most of the time act anything but. It seemed they conviently forgot their beliefs when it was convienent, but then were very quick to judge others based on their perceived transgressions.Overall this was actually one of the worst books I have read and I literally have hundreds of books on my shelves. I am very glad I bought this book used so I didnt actually pay full price. I NEVER get rid of any book I have ever read but this one is going in the give away box."
1,Emily Never Again,"Sheltered, small town girl moves to the Big Scary City and has her beliefs ""tested."" This book is categorized as Chick-Lit. No mention on the cover that this really is a Young Adult Christian novel. The authors are very heavy handed with their depictions. I think the fact that Miss Emily is a Christian is mentioned on every page of the book except for probably the back cover, luring unsuspecting readers in. Except in this case being Christian means that there's no sex before marriage, and more judgments than come out of most courtrooms. Lane, a minor character was probably the most tolerable. Jenna, the hyperactive BFF back in California was obnoxious. This is not a book for the average reader looking for a light Chick-Lit read, this is preachy dogma and should be avoided."
3,Interesting book,"Emily is from a small town outside of San Diego. She always wanted to move to NYC and after graduating college moves there to be a book editor for a friend of her uncles.At first things are going ok. She meets some interesting people and they become friendly. She also meets Bennett who like her is a fellow Christian and they start to date.Things start to go downhill though after a Christmas spent back home and Emily wonders if she made a mistake moving to NYC.The only thing that I did not like about it was Emily's harping on being Catholic. She made it seem like she was so much better than the rest because of her beliefs, but it just made her sound judgmental.What happens? Read Emily Ever After"
2,Meh...,"I've read a lot of 'chick lit' in my time, but this is my first Christian themed novel. I bought it on a whim the other day and settled down to read it with high hopes. However, soon I was mumbling and getting frustrated.Emily Ever After is clearly not the usual chick lit. It's much more... reserved than what I've read. Emily, the main character, seemed bland and weak. I wanted to push her, as she always seemed to hold back. Also, I found the plot to be very predictable, and even guessed the ""twist"" ending while still in the first few chapters of the novel. I doubt I'll be reading this again. Instead, I'll probably pass it on to a friend who might enjoy it more than I did."
2,Not the original artists,"Not the original artists - that about sums it up. Some of the tracks do a good job of sounding like the originals, where others fail. If you want to hear reasonable approximations of these songs cheaply, buy this CD, otherwise, keep looking."
2,"Not so naughty, nor nice","Highly anticipating this book after adoring ""The Pleasure Seekers"", I expected the rousing, emotional read George provided with her previous release. Unfortunately, this book did not live up to its predecessor. Naughty or Nice uses the most over used plot device in historical romance: the feisty ward and the jaded guardian, and does nothing to change the cliched-ness of the hackneyed plot device.Fancy and Lucian are cliched from the beginning of the book and by the end, are just plain carictures of themselves. The reasons for Fancy's disguise are inane and silly and Lucian was nearly over the border of cliched embittered rake. But the biggest wallop I had to swallow was the book's lack of historical wallpaper. TPS was obviously set in the Victorian era, but NoN was all over the place. If you've never read George's historicals, this isn't the book to start. Try The Pleasure Seekers, a compelling and sexy read. I have hopes that George's future work can be as touching as TPS."
3,"Mediocre collection, but the songs are the original versions","A so-so compilation, loaded with forgettable filler songs. But the handful of goodies (""Our Day Will Come,"" ""Pickin' Wild Mountain Berries,"" and ""I Need Your Lovin'"") are in fact the original versions, something important to know when looking for oldies hits."
5,"A couple different songs from the original LP,but still good","I bought this LP way back in 79, and it had more songs.It included Abba-does your mother know,Elton John-Mama Cant Buy You Love,etc.It seems all the Ktel reissues are a little bit different from the original vinyls, as are the beach music series on RIPETE.But nevertheless, it's nice to see them on CD.This was a great various artist LP. To this day I dont know why everybody laughs at Ktel albums, some of them were great.Like this one."
2,Depressing,"This book had a lot of essays, but most of them were really not uplifting, and only perhaps 2 struck me as funny or laugh-out-loud hilarious. It seems that every knitter whose writing was featured in this book endured some sort of hardship, whether they miscarried, had someone or loads of someones die from cancer, or some other horrid tradgedy killed them off. I would not recommend this book as way to beguile anyone into the craft - it made me worry that some horrid piece of luck will befall me just because I knit. I'm taking it back to the bookstore. I don't need this horrid energy in my library. I understand that these people worked through a lot of grief, and that's great, but since I am not surfing that wavelength, reading about their problems is just depressing."
2,Dull and depressing,"I bought the second and third books in this series at my local craft store. I see why they were on clearance. The back covers made them sound full of fun, interesting and inspiring stories. They were dull and too many of them were downright depressing. Not at all what I expected. I won't be keeping these books. Great concept, horrible execution."
3,be reasonable,Are you crazy? Who spend more than 200 dollars for this book? Everything about this topic can be found in the web...Be more reasonable while you write a comment/review about a book like this! And think again before buying it!!!
1,Catch 22!!!!!,purchased this for the rebate of the wireless PC card and still haven't been able to use it since the free card has not been sent yet. It's been 3 months!!! Netgear is totally un responsive. Can't return the item because I had to cut out and send in the UPS from this package to get the free card. Catch 22!!!! Stear clear of Netgear!!!!
1,"Incredibly Frustrating, and it never worked","I bought two of these, my first misatke, and neither worked. After LONG waits for customer support, I got someone in India who was essentially of no help. After more frustration, I got an RMA and sent them back. They sent me only one unit, and it didn't work either! What a headache! I should have returned these things right away."
1,Netgear quality sucks,"I purchased the Netgear wireless print server from another online retailer. The first one was defective. After a few hours with Netgear tech support and with online retailer tech support, returned the unit for another one. Second unit was defective as well. After a long time on the phone with Netgear and Online retailer, returned that as well. Retailer was nice enough to refund me the original shipping cost as well as the cost of shipping the defective items back to them.Setup seems quite straightforward, if only the hardware would work. I would suggest buying it from a local retailer only, that way if it does not work, returning it will not be such a hassle."
2,It works - but it's SLOOOOOOW....,"This print server works - but buyer beware: printing is slow if anything large (like photos or other graphic objects) are printed. All Netgear print servers have only 64 KB (!) buffer (according to their Web site), and this shows. So if performance is a primary concern, look elsewhere. The manufacturer's claim that this device would remove any bottleneck is FAR from the truth - in contrary, using a PC and sharing the printer attached to it gives MUCH better performance. Due to this, I'm still contemplating whether to return this thing or not. Luckily I got it much cheaper than the current Amazon price :-)Another thing is that since the printer is hooked up through the print server, the printer status monitor does not work for some reason. So I can not see how much ink do the cartridges have, for instance. This is annoying, but I could live with it if printing wasn't this slow."
3,Could be better,I also bought this unit thinking it was ready for wireless right out of the box. I'm still waiting for the card to arrive in the mail. Does not work with my other wireless cards (Belkin). Wish it had more RAM. Really chugs along on more intensive print jobs.
3,Too much for too little,"It took me an hour and a half just to get it out of the box. It is plastic and not very durable. Certainly not durable enough for a 5 year old child. It is one of his Christmas presents and if it lasts more than 1 day, I will be very surprized. The packaging is ridiculous. The child will be crying before an adult can get it out."
2,good subject - poor writing,"I didn't read the first book but this is a loser. I tried to keep going past the first 100 pages but this is boring writing, trying to tackle an exciting subject. Save your money and your reading time."
5,An Enchanting Tale,"Heartlight is an enchanting, exciting tale. It warms the heart in a magical way. Barron has a talent for drawing his readers into the book, as if they were a part of it.PS:A good Age to read the book is:10 - 18"
2,"Heartlight, a book review","Heartlight is a science fantasy book by T.A. Barron. The book is about a 7th grade girl named Kate who has moved into a new town. She has trouble making friends, so she spends most of her time with her unusually preoccupied astrophyisist grandfather. When he suffers a heart attack and mysteriously disappears, Kate is forced to embark on a quest to save the sun and another star. I disliked the book because it did not seem very scientific. Also, I would have liked a greater variety of conflicts for Kate. The most well written characters in the book were the giant butterflies, Morpheus and Orpheus. A better science fantasy read with a similar theme would be ""A Wrinkle in Time"" by Madeleine L'Engle."
3,Not Spectacular.,"If you look up a list for the top ten worst science fiction books ever, chances are you will see this book on that list.Somehow, I don't see a great plot here. I almost had to force myself to finish this book. It seems almost directed to little kids in the way that it's about this young girl who's grandfather is this great scientist. When he suddenly disappears, she has to find out where he is and how to save him. Big deal. Compared to other works by T.A. Barron, I'd say that this one is very disappointing. Books by Garth Nix and ""A Wrinkle in Time"" prove to be much more entertaining than this book."
5,Excellent reading,Excellent fantasy to relax and enjoy! T.A. Barron has an incredible imagination and captures it so beautifully for us to read!
1,don't waste your money,"Not only does the pad not have wiring that connects to the control, but all of the lighting function does not work. The music plays leaving the child to either keep up as it play the thirty second song."
1,Not worth it,"Tried to save some $ and get this instead of a polycom. Bottom line, I got the polycom - MUCH better. Now I have 2 conference phones, one that isn't worth it!"
2,Very poor Video Transfer,"The product is a terrible transfer, not from film, but rather from video. Thre producer claims to have gone to great lengths in restoring quality to the segments. I have seen wonderful, clean copies on TCM's ""One Reel Wonders."" The performances themselves are wonderful and worth having, it is too bad that the overseas producer has turned out such poor quality 'dupes. Can ONLY recommend THIS DVD compilation to the die hard Jazz Head, Caveat Emptor."
2,Very Disappointed,"I was very excited to read this book after browsing the contents at the bookstore. But when I tried to follow along, I was lost. I only got through chapter 2 and I couldn't get the example tutorials to work. I am not a Flash Beginner, so I don't think that was the problem.Unfortunatly, I am returning this book. I felt lost within the ""fast paced tutorials"" and I couldn't understand how the code was supposed to work. I felt like some additional explanation was missing.I am a tutorial writer myself, and I know how hard it is to write, so I feel bad for giving a bad review."
2,Couldn't follow it,"Looks and sounds like it might be a good book to learn actionscript, but like another reader, I was very quickly lost. How can you name a book ""zero to hero"", when the book doesn't start at zero? In fact it assumes you know stuff about actionscript, and then moves along way too fast with these assumptions. It just doesn't clearly explain actionscript. Find another book. This one doesn't make sense."
2,This is a MONO soundtrack album.,"Before your purchase, be aware that this is a MONO soundtrack album. Based on the release date of this collection (2007) I presumed I'd be getting a CD that had been digitally remastered in stereo. No such luck. Although it has been cleaned up and actually sounds very good in comparison to many other mono recordings, it fares poorly when compared to a stereo recording. If you plan on putting any of these songs in a playlist with stereo recordings, the degradation in sound will be very noticeable when tracks change. Having said that, some of the better songs are Steam Heat, I Can't Tell A Waltz From A Tango, Keep Me In Mind, Piddilly Pitter Patter, and the kitschy Go On With The Wedding. But it also includes several several duds that probably deserve to be forgotten, including Mama Doll Song and Mama From The Train."
5,A master of the english language and a fascinating subject,Stephen Fox writes so masterfully you'll be mesmorized while reading this fascinating book on a remarkable time in our history.
3,Utilitarian commuter seat,"In spite of being called a ""race"" saddle, I've found this to be exceedingly uncomfortable when riding it anything over 10 miles. It's a pretty hard seat, which I know is relatively common for race saddles, but the shape of this saddle doesn't provide great support for the seat bones. As a result I usually end up getting numb toes after 10-25 miles. I ride this saddle to and from campus every day (2.5 miles) and it works great for that. If you're looking for a cheap replacement seat to get you around town, this will do fine. If you're looking to take it out for extended rides, look elsewhere - I am."
1,No dvd as advertised,This is NOT a dvd as advertised!! Very disappointed! ! Sound quality is not that great either!! Just has pictures a few only! Waste of money!!
4,works well,"Works w/the Toshiba Satellite m45-s355. Fully charged, it will work for 6 hrs, but it makes the computer a little bulkier & heavier, so consider the size of the bag you carry it in."
1,It doesn't work,I can't get this CD to work with Windows XP. There's no sound and no video. I tried the technical support on Transparent Language's website but their solution didn't work either.
3,NOT on-line software,"This CD will interface with the company's web-site for on-line exams, but it is NOT an on-line program. I did notice that the written alphbet pronounciation guide is different from the pronounciation of the speaker on the CD, noticably for LL, j, g and y. I don't know which is correct, and wonder if there may be other errors. Still, for [the money] you can't really go wrong."
2,Softward needs to be upgraded,"I like the contents of the A+ Spanish wordwise; however, the mechanics of this program doesn't work to well. In fact before I purchased German Now 9 (I have German Now 8, Spanish Now 8, and A+ German.) the special features ran somewhat, now only the written, the pronunciation and flash cards part of this program works. I have Windows Me. Perhaps if Transparent Language would update like they did with German Now 9, it would work better on the more recent Windows. Depending what computer system you have, I would recommend buying it."
1,On line software,BEWARE.. This is an online software program..If you don't have DSL buy something else.
5,Pnutbutter/jelly lover,"Works great at getting the jelly out of the jar and onto the bread, what a great idea and useful tool."
3,"It's ok, does what it implies, but not really necessary.","This will do what it says, get in the cracks of the peanut butter/jelly jar, but essentially i'm not sure after trying it how it does it any differently than just angling a typical butter knife in the jar does it, maybe it's supposed to keep your hand from getting sticky or something. Overall though it's just ok, great if you like lots of toys in your kitchen, or for little kids if you prefer they not use a real knife/table knife."
2,Not what I expected...,My boys love trains. I purchased this video for my 3 yr. olds birthday. The video was disappointing. There is no narration for the video. They don't tell you the kind of trains you are looking at. I was not impressed with this video.
5,Awesome Video,My son is only 14 months old and loves this DVD. The first time we watched it he stood in front of the TV and danced to the nonstop music. The music if very upbeat and fun. I even found myself singing the theme song days later.
1,Poor video quality....,I bought all 3 volumes for my train fanatic 10 year old. The quality of the dvds on all 3 volumes is very poor. He has not been as interested in watching them as much as he was about getting them. Definitely NOT what I expected. Total waste of money.
5,A big hit with grandson!,"My 5 year old grandson loves this dvd. As soon as he walks in the door he asks to play it. I purchased two different ones and sent one home with him. This one stays at Nana's house. It gets more viewing than the Thomas dvds. He specifies that he wants to see the ""real"" trains."
2,Dollar store quality,"We were disappointed in this dvd collection. We purchased the two volume set ""As seen on TV"", for my 4 yr old grandson, who is crazy about trains,he could not wait for it to arrive. There is no narration; the music; sound and quality of the dvd's is cheesey. The quality of the picture seems like one of those old VHS movies. It kept my grandson's attention for about 15 mins, and that was only the first dvd. I sat there astounded on how this didn't go directly to the Dollar Store bins. Of course this is only my opinion."
1,Loserville.,"Video was nowhere near what I expected. It was a waste of every penny I spent. 300 snippets, and not a single piece of data. Railroading is rewarding only when you know where a particular shot was taken, you are told about the engines & rolling stock, & something about the specific railroad you are watching. It MUST be educational, which this video is NOT ! I cannot return it, per Amazon's policies, so I guess I will have to simply throw it away, & chalk this whole thing up to experience. I only gave it 1 star, because the site forced me to; I had not intended to give it any."
2,Fails to captivate a train-mad two-year-old,"This video appears to be nothing more than a repetitive collection of fairly dull amateur and promotional video clips set to a handful of pleasant, if forgettable, songs. My son is two years old and can't stop talking about, or take his eyes off, of train, but this video loses even his attention after a few minutes."
4,Great DVD for a pre-schooler!,"Ordered this DVD for my young grandchild. He watches it over and over. It's a fast-paced look at trains, old and new, from freight to passenger. I will order additional volumes in this series."
1,Poor DVD quality!!,"I purchased this DVD for my 2 1/2 year old son. It was so disappointing when we put the DVD in and played it. The DVD is such a poor quality. The dvd continually skips and freezes up. I say, save your money and look for a better train DVD that is made with a higher standard of quality."
2,3 yr old wasn't impressed,"Will try watching it again later, but our 3 yr old train LOVER was a bit bored watching this. Maybe it was the music? Not sure. He asked to watch Mighty Machines instead.We adults did chuckle at some of the randomness of the footage. Maybe this will grow on us as we give it more of a chance. ???"
3,I was never a dedicated fan.,"I only really remembered the main Mr. Big songs that I saw the videos for on Much Music. They were catchy and I liked them. I thought I'd buy their Greatest Hits to get the ones I remembered and basically sample some of the ones I've never heard of. In the end, the ones I remembered were the best on the CD. The others are a little forgettable in my opinion. Again, I was never a dedicated fan."
3,Biased but historically accurate,The author does a solid job of presenting conflicting biblical accounts from historical and logical perspective but struggles to do so without religious prejudice. If you want to understand the Bible more clearly this book will assist you. Knowing the author's atheist position allowed me to learn the historical settings of biblical stories and walk away with a clear and more truthful way to understand how religious stories can enhance our understanding of ourselves and our social structure as humans. Although faith is deeply individual and personal I am of a mindset that faith requires truth in order to be valid and that accepting conflicting information until such time as we can understand more fully is faith affirming. This writer helps clear confusions within the bible with historical and archeological fact.
2,Hoped for more...,"I have enjoyed Fox's other work (namely Pagans and Christians), but this was perhaps one of the worst critical works on the Bible. Fox's alleged discrepencies are so ""already been there"" that I wonder if he took the time to read any of the leading works on the subject (for instance Gleason Archer's works).I doubt Fox did any study of the answer to Biblical criticism, as I'm sure he would have left a few of his points completely out of this work.""Pagans and Christians"" is much much better."
3,An atheist's personal view that helped to convert me,Robin Lane Fox seems to be working in isolation and I have seen works by other historians (rather than Christian apologists) take issue with this work. But as an example of his personal views as an atheist it fascinated me. Fox believes that John's Gospel is written by a disciple of Jesus who saw the empty tomb and this made me fundementally re-examine my own beliefs. I ended up moving from atheist to Catholic which might not be what Fox intended. This book is a good antidote to fanatical sceptics who want to completely debunk the New Testament.
1,Piss poor prose and rampant colons,"I couldn't, I think, stand, under the circumstances, this book. The constant, perhaps helpful, perhaps not, use of commas, with no real reason, was irritating: the use of colons added to that; sometimes colons are usefuls, and sometimes a period suffices.Robin Lane Fox needs to learn how to write (and source his material, and write it in an organized and readable fashion).- a secular humanist"
5,Gentle exercises,This is a great chair workout for seniors or those with special needs. The exercises are very gentle but invigorating.
5,Good read.,Anything by Michael Card is excellent! He has a wonderful way of engaging his imagination and bringing the reader along for the trip.
3,Light but doesn't slide on stuff,"I love this hose and I hate this hose. It's very light and flexible, you hardly know you have it connected to the nail gun, but it also has a mind of its own and will twist and loop and catch on just about everything. It's really grippy too, it will not slide against stuff (framing, ladders etc) when you pull on it. Even when I carefully coil it up after use, the next time I uncoil it, it gets all tangled up. As I said, I like it, but it's annoying at times. I don't know of anything that is better though."
5,great buy,It was exactly what i expected. Definltey was a great buy. I would recocommend this product to anyone and everyone.
5,Just as it should be...,"Working ok since first connected, not a single issue due to straight or crossover cables, just what I was looking for, have a couple of servers hooked on it and the speed is great. I DO recommend it."
4,Good entertainment and learning package,The pros are it has a lot of information about the physical universe. The 3d views and mini movies are great. The cons are it has a lot of controls so children might find it a little overwhelming. Once you get the hang of the program it is great. I am very happy with this purchase and if I had to do it again I would. So if you are patient and have a couple of hours to learn how to use the program then anyone who wants to know about the planets and universe would benefit from this program.
3,Father and Son,"Somewhat similar to movies like ""Bend It Like Beckam"" or ""East is East"", ""My Son the Fanatic"" is an interesting effort that wisely approaches subjects like the generational gap, the clash of cultures, family ties and social disorder. Presenting a credible and realistic atmosphere with solid acting (Om Puri is particularly great), compelling characters, witty dialogue, a good plot and a fine mix between drama and comedy, this cinematic experience doesn`t quite reach classic status but manages to deliver a strong and convincing movie. The pacing is a bit uneven, though, and some more comedy-oriented moments wouldn`t hurt. Still, a good flick nonetheless.Recommended."
4,Memories...,"I think I was 13 or 14 when I first read this book, a gift from my godfather for Christmas. I always heard good things about Nancy Drew but never took the time to read them. Course I'm talking about the older ones, which I have read as well. I enjoyed this book, as I have enjoyed every other Nancy Drew book. I own most of them, would love to own them all. I would recommend this to any teenage girl, Nancy Drew is a good role model....course I wouldn't go and get myself into alot of trouble like she seems to do, but it still seems like fun!"
5,Gift Item,My college aged daughter read one of these poems in class and couldn't stop talking about it. I'm excited to give her this collection.
3,Typical,"Well written but very typical. I admit I have not read others in the series. Not bad, but dont start here."
5,Reverses dark circles months back,I purchases this item and have been using it for 2 weeks. and my dark circles have reduced to the state that they were in 8 months back! Miracle!!
1,product sent to me in unusable condition,"While I have been very pleased with the Kinerase product I have used in the past, bought through a different source, the tube I was sent from a company using Amazon to distributue was unusable and I am hoping to receive a full refund. The creme had separated into oil that had turned rancid and the rest comes out in little chunks.Kinerase 0.125% N6-furfuryladenine Under Eye Rescue (20g) 0.7 Ounce"
1,Absolutely Useless,"I've been using the Kinerase facial cream for many years and really love it, so when I started seeing fine lines under my eyes, I thought I'd try their ""eye rescue."" What a disappointment. This creme did absolutely nothing. It's just an overpriced moisturizer that did NOT deliver on it's claim of improving fine lines and puffiness. I should have saved the $75 I spent and just used the regular face cream under my eyes instead. For that matter, a cheap bottle of hand lotion would have produced the same results (or lack thereof). Don't believe the hype. Save your money!"
1,Internet Technology Guy Not Exactly Happy With VOIP Accelearator,"To me thisVoip Internet Accelerator Intelligent Packet Priority Enginedoes not live up to the proclaimed capabilities. I have the same problem as an internet technology guy who usses skype, vonage an routers etc, I have lots of uploads and downloads going on and this device no matter what I do I just don't see the great benefit. There is no solid indicator of what it is doing for me differently so I find it hard to recommend since I don't see a difference. There could be a benefit but I will never know what causes the slow down or not because no indicators of I am working as I am suppose to or better or worst because of theVoip Internet Accelerator Intelligent Packet Priority Engine"
1,Causes more problems than it's worth,"Firstly, this does make VOIP calls more stable, but it causes so many 'strange' browsing problems that I just had to stop using it. I really like the way that this device prioritises traffice, but as I said, too many problems and too little configuration. I am very technical and spent quite a bit of time trying to get this working well and unfortunately, I'm just better off without it.I am on 7000/896 DSL internet."
2,Should Cost Only US$9.99 For This Substandard DVD!!!,"I bought this DVD out of curiosity and my liking of noir films. Boy oh boy how I got so lucky. The picture quality was like it was transfered from an unmastered VHS, the English subtitles were really small and non-removable and the plot was so disinteresting. I didn't really care what was going on and I couldn't make head nor tail of most of the movie since the picture was so abysmal and the camera movement was pretentiously jittering. Such a dark day for Polish cinema. I'd rather see TRICKS (SZTUCZKI) once again."
1,not as pictured,"OK, I liked the sugar bowl, but there is definitely no resemblance between the picture of the creamer and what you actually get! The picture shows a higher protruding spout, what you get is a spout that is lower than the top rim, it is pulled back into the jug with a 2 inch slit in front that dribbles all over no matter how you try to pour from it. Actually it looks like it has a hairlip... Since I didn't pay a fortune for it, I have decided to keep it to show friends how weird it looks."
1,Deformed Creamer,"Having seen this attractive Sugar and Creamer set in the stores, I was happy to find it at Amazon for a lower price. The set arrived well-packaged and in a timely manner. However the Creamer had an odd shape - its spout was deformed. I returned the set to Amazon for a refund since there was no assurance that a replacement set would not exhibit similar problems.Quality control for some cookware and/or serveware sold at Amazon seems inadequate. If products sold are slightly flawed or seconds, Amazon should advise the customer."
2,"beautiful design, poor execution","The design is simple but beautiful. However, there is debris in the glass - little black spots all over both pieces. I received this as a gift a while ago so I'll be donating these."
1,don't buy this toy,"I bought this toy because the picture looked cool but, when I put this toy together it looked competly diffrent than the picture and this toys legs where all croked it can barely stand up.The figure isn't that good.It would have been nice if it had lightsabers."
1,NOT AS COOL AS IT LOOKS...,"It looks cool. It wants to be cool. I WANTED it to be cool. But it's not.Here's the skinny:~ The exclusive figure does not fit in the chair.(be warned the ""Wheel-General"" is barely articulated)~ The piece is ill-balanced.~ It rolls unsteadily (when it rolls).~ It stands poorly.~ It's awkward to hold and clumsy to play with.~ and to top it off, it ""feels"" cheap.Do not be swayed by the stunning packaging. Do not be fooled by the exclusive figure. This is a weak offering from the Hasbro team. Don't get caught up in the hype, learn from my mistake."
1,This is okay......,"I bought this with high hopes of getting a well modeled vehicle. It took about only ten minutes to put together, and it comes with General Greivous!!! But, the legs are really weird. I wasted $20.00 dollars at a local super target I could have got a star wars video game or a few figs..... I just like adding it to my collection. But, if you have the Obi-Wan with Boga, put them together like I did.The Star Wars saga has introduced some really good toys, I am just saying that this toy is fairly good. Not a favorite. I suggest it to a collecter only........I love the line of E3 collectables. They really rock. I suggest this because it is okay in the stage of durable and fun. Star Wars E3 General Greivous' wheel bike is a great toy I hope people should think about buying."
5,"The ""Wheely Toy"" arrive on time","My son loves the Star Wars toy. Anything to do with Star Wars, he just loves. The item came on time; there was no delay which was good for my sone because he remembered the day it was going to aarive and sure it was waiting on my front porch. It was also neatly packaged, no broken parts."
4,Good rain clog,"I got these for my daughter. They are a little bit big, but I just layer socks with them. They keep her foot nice and dry. The colors are wonderful, with a little bit of whimsy. Traction is very good. This will be a great shoe for springtime."
5,Get this single!,"Gigi D'Agostina is not that well known here in the states but I'm sure that will change with the release of this song. On track three he overlays all the vocals and it's absolutely mesmerizing. You can't help but close your eyes and soak it in. The last track is actually an instrumental, not so good, but the first three remixes make this cd worth buying. His music is kind of reminiscent of the '80s with it's techtronic feel, but that's the beauty of it, this is a fresh sound being revived for us in the states. Instead of the typical driving bass and repetition of vocals. I recommend this one even over, ""I'll Fly with You"" and Another Way, although those are good too. Hope you all enjoy this as much as I did!"
1,Uncle,"This blade does not have a ""mirror finish"" as advertised but a dull matte finish with faint Chinese dragon etchings. The ""Colorful Accents"" are nothing more than plastic inserts of various designs. Nice looking when desplayed in scabbard from a distance."
2,Not a great sword,I had a bit higher hopes for this sword. It was inexpensive and I guess its true you get what you pay for. I still use it in ceremony but its not quite what I had in mind. The inlay is rather cheesy and the hilt pulls very difficultly from the sheath. Better to spend a bit more and get a quality item
4,Could use an update,"Nien Nunb is probably the most important character from the original trilogy that hasn't yet received an updated since the POTF2 line. This figure wasn't bad for the time, and still hold up decently. However, it has minimal articulation and the color tones for his Sullastan face are a bit off. The 2009Build-A-Droid Wave 09 - B-Wing Pilot Nien Nunbfigure shows how much better Hasbro can make Sullastans nowadays. It'd be great to see a Nien Nunb in his smuggler's gear come out next year in the vintage line."
1,Not as pictured - quit after 3 days,"Recieved the lighter and worked for three days, looks slightly like the one pictured, but not the same. A waste of money and time. Shipping cost was outrageous."
2,Cute idea,"Poor execution. Works intermittently, but when it does work it is nice. But so much trouble it sits in storage. Much easier to use a full size torch."
2,Worked for a while...,"This product is not worth your money. It worked fine for a week or so, but then refused to cooperate. It will light, but not stay lit for over a second. If you want a nice torch lighter, spend a little bit more."
5,A good game,A huge world to explore and great graphics. Worked fine on my system too (P4 with Radeon graphics card). Probably the best first person perspective role playing game available at the moment. It also has an advantage in that it is good for the solo adventurer. I would say that it will take a fair bit of time and patience to complete it.
4,Fun for about a Week or Two...,"This game is sooo awesome for about 2 weeks then the game gets very repetative and boring, Once you visit most all the cities the game turns into job instead of a game. I mean it is a great game but it just gets boring after a while. But if you have some extra money to throw around go for it, but if you know a friend that has it, borrow it, Or just play it as his/her house! Over all a great game!"
3,Booooooring,This is one of the most boring games I have ever played in my life all you do is run around and do boring questI been playing it for 3 days now trying to get the hang of it but it's just too boring.There's no action in the game what so ever you'll find yourself running around for hours and hours without any adventure what so ever if you're the type that likes long boring games with no action this is the game for you.
3,Very Useful Calendar,"Being new to Wiccan, I found this book not only useful as a date book, but as a reference book for the Craft. Granted I have other books to reseach Wicca with, but this provided historical facts about witchcraft, recipes, and ritual ideas as well. Definitely a good tool to have!The only things I would change about the date book, would be to make the cover less conspicuous, for those of us who need to remain in the broom closet, and to choose artwork with different styles, not just the same simple, blocky art over & over again."
3,Average album; C-Bo's done better before,"One Life 2 Life is a just a average album for C-Bo, who has previously released all stellar material. It has a few bumpin' tracks, but it has just as many sleepers. One of the problems with One Life 2 Live is that C-Bo sounds like he's losing his edge on some tracks, such as the blatantly commercial ""Club Hoppin"". Too many of the other tracks seem watered down from his earlier albums. Real fans will appreciate the album's handful of adrenilane pumping tracks, but it won't dethrone any of his previous works."
2,2.1 lanny woods is right,"C-Bo is tight but this cd is hella regular and short. there are only twelve songs which worked in tales from the crypt (his best cd) however he had used a few of these songs elsewhere and this is the cd where fred smith seemed like he did not try real hard for very long on his cd. on this cd and especially now since Bo comes out with a cd every eight months it does not seem like he tries really hard to make a particularly good product, and i now see why this is the last awol cd i got because this was his worst with them"
1,WARNING,"Expecting a package from Amazon is always a lot of fun. On some occasions the joy of receiving that package is quickly turned in to horrible disappointment. Getting this book was one of those moments. I don't know how the writers got their facts, if it was from ""The National Inquirer"", from the local psychic or if they just plain made it up, but it should be called fiction, not fact. To sum up my opinion: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK-IT STINKS!"
4,One of the best serial killer books out there,"Just my humble opinion, but I think this book is one of the better collections of serial killer stories available. I found this title at Half-Price Books while browsing the true crime section. I've looked at several more books on serial killers since I got Human Monsters a couple years ago, and still, none compare. I think the author spends enough time talking about each person - not too much, but not too little, and the book includes facts on your favorite murderers and cannibals while providing a little insight into the lives of some lesser-known criminals. It's one of few books in my large collection that I have actually finished reading and may even read again.I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone who's interested in true crime or serial killers. I found it very informative, personally."
2,Good Overall Info - If You Are Into Gore (2 1/2 *),"And I'm not. There are many murderers listed in this book, in apparently no kind of order, so if you're looking for a specific one, take your time. Most of these are the gory killers, whose sadism and senseless torture of their victims (humans and animals alike) would make me ill if I read it, so I skipped those parts, which left me with not much to read.I will have to take the word of previous reviewers who noted errors in the stories, since I'm not very familiar with the serial/torture killer type. I did notice that Mr. Everitt mentioned that Charles Whitman wrote a note requesting an autopsy before he went on his shooting spree in the tower at the University of Texas, but the author fails to mention that one was done afterward, and a large tumor was found in his brain. Just so you know."
3,Not a typical for a singer that I love.,"I have several records of this fabulous singer, mainly folks' songs and others. I love them and I'm listening to them for many years, so I bought blindly the first and the only CD I found and was disappointed. Thats not her in these pop songs. Three stars for nostalgy. Five stars for other records. PUT THEM ON CD's!"
3,Yellow Sling Swing,"I replaced the ropes with chain (using large S hooks to connect) and slipped clear, plastic protective tubing around the top of each chain to protect the large oak branches it was going to go over. It worked beautifully. I made a good product even better. I love the swing (and so do our neighbor's children)!"
4,Good strings,"Been playing with these strings since 84. Still a good value, Used to come with a sticker for your guitar case."
5,These are the best,"I've used Dean Markley strings for as long as I can remember. They're a little ""bright"" sounding when you first string them, but after some playing, they mellow out. One thing I like is that they rarely break unless you're really strumming. And if you don't have much money, not buying strings all the time really counts. Happy picking and strumming!"
5,Size doesn't matter,"This disk is delightful. In short packages (about 25 minutes each) one gets four masses by JS Bach that have many of the features we look forward to in his much larger works. The playing and singing are mellifluous and exuberant, and given the fact that you get 2 discs, it's a real bargain. Don't hesitate if you're interested!"
3,mixed feelings,"I have mixed feelings about this book. As has been stated, the illustrations are really bright and colorful. And obviously, the women featured are amazing people. But...it does have a very simplistic (even for a kids book) heavy-handed way about it. And somehow it bugs me that the primary author is a man. No women authors available to do the job? The underlying message, though, that with determination you can do it, is a useful one for little girls."
1,Does the opposite!,"The book spends more time talking about what girls are not suppose to do as a way of introducing what girls ""can do"". I am going to let my girls cut out the pretty pictures in the book because the narrative is an embarrassment to the 21st century."
1,This movie is simply not worth your time.,"We are not spoiled with good Sci-Fi / Fantasy movies, and you are most likely to be disapointed if you intend to get your hands on this flick.Building up an commentry of this movie is rather a waste of time, because it lacks everything; story, casting etc. I got burned, you don't have to!"
4,in defense of evelyn's poetry...,"i love the way she writes about dark subjects, which range from adultery to child abuse...she tries on many masks in her poetry and they are always breathtaking. she is gifted with imagery and many of the poems i could see as clear as paintings as i was reading them. you have a right to criticize her, but i wonder could you do any better? i doubt it. they registered strongly with me on an emotional level. i love artists who dont let political correctness influence their work. evelyn is also a fine novelist, too..."
2,Same same and more of the same,"Most people have disturbing sexual experiences some times in thier lifes and yes, Everlyn Lau's were worse than most. Men do treat women with disrespect and being the other woman is no fun. Although, I agree with all those premises, and agree that these topics should be explored in poetry, I cannot condone talking about it over and over and over again in the same collection.If everlyn condenced some of these poems with similar ideas into longer ones, and stopped revisiting the same topics throughout the whole book, I think she could be a good poet. For this collection, she is an immature writer, lacking in experience, and different perspective. Apart from the henious experience she lived through on the streets, that somehow must have -in the Canadian Literary scene- gained her sympathy points, I cannot understand why she is hailed as such a celebrated writer. Decent: yes, great: no."
3,Erotic and odd,"Evelyn writes about her days on the streets and as a prostitute. She hates men, judging by these poems,and judging from her ""Diary of a Street Kid"" she hates herself, and is self-destructive and self-absorbed at the same time. Kind of hard to figure. But she is a good writer; bright with obvious talent. I just wish she would fall in love, and write some less disturbing poetry."
4,Caterpillars of Field and Garden,"This is a very nicely done guide to the subject, and it is only flawed by the fact that moth larvae are not included. See ""Caterpillars of Eastern North America: A Guide to Identification and Natural History"" (Princeton Field Guides)by David L. Wagner for a more comprehensive guide. But, if you are serious about the subject, you should probably have both books."
5,Documents the history of his achievement,"From the moment of its opening in 1964, Andy Warhol's Silver Factory was a popular staple of the New York art scene. Factory Made: Warhol And The Sixties is an informative guide which documents the history of his achievement, surveying the lives of factory members interviewed for feature herein and providing insights into the collaborative artworks produced by their interactions. Warhol's experiment resulted in unparalleled arts production, documented in an intriguing, inviting guide."
5,Excellent rendering of the events of the time,"This book gives an excellent history of Warhol's factory from it's genesis to it's demise, with lotza cool pics too."
4,Thin story but well done,"This is not a movie that you ""just can't turn off and walk away for a few minutes"". No suspense at all. zero, zilch. It's, at best, a thin story line with not much substance. What you might call ""drawing room comedy"". The children were skipped over almost completely so that in the scenes with the whole family as older people you really didn't know who is who. But, it's a charming story with charming actors, beautiful costumes and set decorations. I just think it could have been a great deal better with perhaps a better script writer."
5,What a Find!,"I found this band from a great compilation put together by an independent radio station in Bloomington, IN: www.wttsfm.com on their annual Collector's Edition CD. Old Bones is a great song. Great rhythms, harmonies, and cool lyrics. Got to love the free download!! I'll be buying this CD as a result. You can always count on WTTS to come up with new progressive sounds, and this is a keeper!!"
4,Great Dreamweaver 4 Introduction,"Since this book is a bit outdated I won't write a long review, but this is a great book for anyone that is looking to learn how to use Dreamweaver 4 and get up and running to making your web site. Packed full of 600+ pages, I have always felt that the Quickstart guides are perfect books for anyone that is looking to quickly start learning a new technology, and that certainly is the case with this guide. Snappy writing, a nice layout, and all and all a great FEEL for the book (all the Quickstart guides have this feel) make this a proven winner.**** RECOMMENDED"
3,My adventures with Dreamweaver,"J. Tarin Tower's book, ""Dreamweaver for Windows and Macintosh"" is a good book, as far as it goes; but there is nothing (as far as I can find) about Timelines, which are important if you're going to create any kind of song and dance on your website. It has been helpful to me in the self-taught business of learning Dreamweaver. While it is very polished and well organized, with step by step instructions on how to implement the many features of the program, it is weak in terms of the big picture, how and why various sub-routines can be used to solve a design problem and achieve a particular effect. I'd say it's the best book in its field, mainly because there isn't anything else out there - yet, as far as I know."
3,Mislabled,"The product as shown is claimed to be unbreakable. The product delivered, which has the same model number as shown, is glass and does not include the bottom covering shown in the illustration."
2,For those readers eagerly awaiting JD's new book...,"...here it is! If you are unfortunate enough to have read ""At Home in the World,"" then you will have read that ole JD himself made revisions to this entire book, as Joyce says so herself. File this one under Serry Jallinger! I give it one star for Joyce, the other for Jerry!"
5,Babaloo Al,"This is a GREAT album, Babaloo music always get me grooving throughout my day! If you haven't seem Babaloo live, you are missing out! They take you all over the world with their music styles and languages. Before you know, they will get you dancing, shaking, and having a great great time... no exeptions! I highly recommend this cd and as well as their live shows.!!!Babaloo I love you!!!"
1,Drek,"Florid, Pretentious, Stream of Consciousness, Drivel. It wound up in the round file @ page 125."
5,One To Count Cadence,This is an outstanding book and it reminds me of my time of service in Vietnam.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys light reading that deals witha wartime situation.
3,"Lots of grit and extra edgy, but not a great book","I like gritty, edgy stories and this one is about as gritty and edgy as you can get. But, I can't say I felt it had much more to offer. The characters are pretty over the top and not well enough developed that you feel like you can relate to them. The same criticism would apply to the story. I also never really felt like I was in the scenes as their descriptions were not vivid enough to put me there.I'll try at least one more Crumley novel before I write his work off and move on to other writers. I think this was his first work and I also believe most of his other work is detective related. Maybe he can bring the grit and the edge a little more fluidly to that genre. It was simply too much of a chore to get myself to finish this book."
2,This book is really difficult for new Calculus students!,"James Stewart has gone far and beyond from the ordinary math course. He uses good examples and excellent looking graphics. However, once you start doing the problems they soon become quite difficult after doing four or five of them. I have spoken to a different Calculus instructor, not mine, and he says the same thing. He said that the author did not publish enough simple, easy to do problems before immediately getting into real difficult problems. I give it 2 stars because it might be easy for a math major to understand this text, however this book is supposed to gear more towards first time Calculus students."
3,Not enough covered in Stewart's Calculus:concepts&contexts,"The text is very good, straightforward, readable, and has great graphs (I especially like the sections with the graphing calculator). However, the book lacks a) the rigor and b) the amount of examples which would make it an excellent text. The sequences and series unit was cut a bit short, and there could have been more in the differential equations unit (like, for example, how to solve second-order differential equations). Overall, a good textbook."
2,"not helpful, would not buy again",if you know nothing about vb it might be useful; treats you like an idiot
1,Worthless,Another worthless book from Microsoft Press. Microsoft must pay its writers by the word. This book could be boiled down to 25 pages.
4,Good for beginners,"This book is well suited for beginners or near-beginners who want to learn basic programming in VB2005. Sometimes I felt it would have helped if I had had some earlier programming knowledge/experience, this way I would have been able to grasp the consepts easier as this book does not really discuss programming-theory on a broader level. It is a good book to start with if you plan to learn more about programming in asp.net."
5,Great intro into VB,"Highly recommended for anyone starting with Visual Basic or programming in general. I bought this book to have a better understanding of how Visual Basic differed from other programming languages I have had experience with before (Java and Python) and I learned a whole lot. The step by step tutorials were great in showing me how to perform basic tasks using the language. I actually have read through this book twice now because 1) it is such an easy read, and 2)it always helps to refresh some of the concepts (especially for me since I can be quite forgetful)."
4,A Happy-go-lucky little kid...who just happens to be a dino!,"Your child doesn't ""have"" to be a dinosaur addicted to love this film!Dink is like any other human child on his behavior,that fears,loves and has an urge to learn new things.This video includes ""5"" diferent stories with children's favorite subjects like: Friendship,courage,outrageous adventures, self confidence,curiosity and a little , just a little bit of spookiness (don't worry,my children are 1,5 and 3 years old and they were not skared at all,despite of what the title might sugest!)The new releases of dinosaur movies can sometimes be scarry for the little ones but here we are talking about a sweet and colorfull cartoon with some very beautiful messages inlaided!"
4,A good starting place...,"If you're looking to try linux for the first time, this is a good place to begin. Redhat's popularity and (relatively) installationa nd upgrade packages make it very good for windows/mac users to get their feet wet in the unix world. Linux is still very much a tinkerer's operating system with some rough edges, but once setup is finished, I believe a normal user could now operate redhat without being a unix-savvy guru. If you've had some experience with linux before, I would recommend you look at the debian distribution, which offers an improved management/upgrade system and is generally geared a bit more to the unix-savvy.For those who are unaware, 'Linux' actually describes the core of the operating system (called the kernel), and the rest of the programs, including the 'windows', are packaged together as a 'distribution', which all have different plusses and minuses. Redhat is very popular, so finding support for it is relatively easy. Enjoy!"
3,SuSE vs. RedHat review (...),"(...)What I as an (Oracle) server user don't like about RedHat is the missing Oracle support (of course it will work; but compare with SuSE (...) and also Oracle uses SuSE for their Linux development now, they switched away from RedHat), and some server features like the Logical Volume Manager was long missing and is still much better supported by SuSE. So yes, independently RedHat deserves a great review, but in comparison with SuSE it's only #2, that's the reason why I subtracted some points."
4,"Good base, but lack of powertools detracts","Overall, Red Hat 7.2 is a good distribution - the installation process is very simple, and should be easy to handle for Windows users trying out Linux for the first time. You can have a ready-to-use system in under an hour if you are fimiliar with Linux, while new users will have to do some light reading from the included installation manual.-Red Hat 7.2 is a little hardware hungry with the default install. You'll need at least a Pentium II and 64MB RAM to run it smoothly.-The loss of the powertools CD is a blow for those users who want to tweak their system a little bit, especially those that want to replace Sendmail with Postfix. Replacing Sendmail in 7.1 required a simple RPM installation. Now you get to build Postfix from source."
1,A TERRIBLE OS,"Here are my gripes about this OS:It's Unstable - X Windows crashed on me about once an hour. Also, about twice every day there would be a kernel panic.It's Insecure - There are numerous security holes that have been patched. That doesn't make me feel better: If all these holes have been patched, how many more are there that are still unknown?It's VERY DIFFICULT to install and use - Not user friendly at all.TERRIBLE default configuration - bash is their default shell. Everyone else in the world uses csh. bash is a joke.Yes, this OS is cheaper than Windows. But McDonalds is cheaper than a gourmet resturant. That doesn't mean McDonalds is better. Linux is the McDonalds of the operating system world."
5,Another Great Red Hat Release!!!,"i think this is the best distribution of Linux out on the market today. i have never had a problem with any of the features. it is reliable, easy to install, and comes with many very good packages. i plan on staying a loyal Red Hat customer for many more years to come."
4,Excellent for the Server,"As a consultant, I find the latest release of RH 7.x series to be a great addition to any IT department's server pool. It has everything you need for a SQL Database Server, Web, E-mail, not to mention some pretty good desktop features. Easy to configure for a Linux Distro. All the power of Unix, without the cost!"
1,"Looks nice, but doesn't work properly","You can only have the plug in halfway to hear the music right. If the plug is inserted all the way in, it sounds muted. I plugged my headphones directly back in and it sounded fine so it's not my jack or headphones, it's the cable. Nice looking quality but how am I supposed to use these moving around. I should have read the reviews more closely."
1,Bad Quality,I can only hear out of left channel unless I wiggle the cable. Brand new out of box either defective or poor build quality.
5,Works great.,I use this so I can sit in my bed and listen to music or movies on my headphones without bothering my roommates.
3,Great but one flaw.,"This cable has great build quality and doesn't tangle at all, except for one draw back, it's weight. I didn't realize how heavy the connector is, moving around makes it disconnect constantly from my Sony headphones. At times I have to place the connector on the table or on my lap because when it falls or I walk and extend the cable it gets disconnected easily. Ill just have to use tape to hold it in place."
1,does not work with headphone/microphone combo jack,"I'm giving this one star not necessarily because it deserves it, but because I think more people will see this if I do. I purchased this as an extension for a pair of Klipsch Image Ones, but I experienced what many other people have with the very poor sound quality. I found that with other headphones/earbuds the extension cable worked fine. The Klipsch have a built-in microphone, so the jack has 3 rings, separating it into 4 sections: L audio, R audio, microphone, and ground. I found that any other headphone jack with just L audio, R audio, and ground worked fine. So, if your headphones have a built-in microphone, I would advise to stay away from this extension cable, if not I think you'll find this cable to be sufficient. The build quality seemed reliable, but I did not spend much time with it as I had purchased the cable for use with the Klipsch. Thus I did not really use it much before I returned it."
4,Nice but Loose Casing,"I purchased this product to allow my Dad's headphones to reach a connection I made to the TV. The only drawback it has is that on the female end the casing gets loose from the gold colored part. The two parts have to be screwed back together as they get loose. So, you can hold the gold part and screw the silver part. When it's not held together tightly one of the earphones does not have any sound. This doesn't happen often though. Otherwise I am happy with this product."
5,Works well,"These cables sound fine, and the build quality is great. They would be repairable if it were ever needed.They do come unplugged relatively easily. Here's my layout:Computer -> extension by monitor -> extension on floor -> ampThe one by the monitor is so it's easy to add headphones in. The connection on the floor is by my feet, and I unplug it sometimes on accident. A little gaffers tape solved the problem. If I needed another extension I would buy these without a second thought."
1,horriable audio quality,I did some testing with this cable to find out that it reduces the audio quality considerably with more than one device. I tested this with my computer using headphones plugged directly in to the computer and then in to the wire to the computer and there was a very noticeable difference in volume and there was even some echoing of the audio.save your money there is something majorly wrong with these cables
1,right channel cuts out intermittently,"poor quality - the right audio channel cuts out frequently - i have to jiggle my headphone plug around in the connector to get both channels to play properly. I've tried multiple headphones in this cable, so I'm sure it's the cable & not the headphones. very poor quality for a cable that has been treated gently and used infrequently."
1,Defective design; do not purchase,"My first cable was defective and when Amazon sent me a replacement, that one was defective too. The problem has to do with the flawed design of the female end of the cable: when a plug is fully seated (i.e. it feels like it's clipped-in properly), the metal contacts are not correctly aligned with the jack's, so only a small range of audio frequencies are transmitted. I was able to get full audio by partially unseating the plug, but then the whole connection was one small wiggle away from coming completely undone. I'm pretty sure that the flaw has to do with the third band for the microphone that is now standard on so many headphone plugs. I had better luck with headphones without a microphone, but the issues were still occasionally present."
1,junk,"lasted 2 weeks, used only as a replacement extension for my shure earbuds. cable ended up failing in the connection to the end connectors. the end connectors were overly heavy and big probably resulting to the wiring failure at the solder point. these are junk."
3,So much could have been done...,"This game has a huge worldmap and fantastic graphics, but, unfortunately, they were ruined by very tedious gameplay and a VERY slow beginning."
2,morrowind,After speeding home from the store with my new game i just got (morrowind).i could not wait to get it open to play man it looked and sound so cool from the back of the box and some review i look up on the net.But wow they where wrong man this game starts out nice with the way you can pick your guy out and class and traid you what to be but that is it.After that it gos down hill fast to me.1 the fighting is week 2 wen you find a guild and join it it is for nothing but to wast alot of time doing nothing that will mean anything in the game.3 well the bugs dont help out.Well just not what i was looking for it to be after reading the back and trusting some good review sites.BUT the graphics are way cool but i could not tell if i ever got out of the dungeon the game was so dark.
1,One of the fortunate few,"Unfortunately, I am one of the fortunate few for whom this game will not run regardless of what I do to remedy the situation. I find it deplorable that such a shoddy product could be foisted on the public."
1,money pit.,"My review will be short, full of acid and to the point. This game was suppose to tbe a crhistmast preasent from my mom and dad only to find out that the screen only goes up to 24 true color. Now I have to buy a new video card so I can play it and say if I like it or not.READ THE SYSTEM REQUIRMENTS CARFULLY!!! and for those of you who have enough money to burn and have intel 4's and windows XP well good for you but us mere mortals don't have that kind of money to spend."
5,A 'real' world.,"This game is not just role playing, but role _living_.If you just want some random hack'n'slash there might be better titles for you, because the world of Morrowind is so complete, that you start having concerns, obligations and delights in this computer world.The thrill when sneaking through an old tomb with a crossbow ready is excelent, but playing Morrowind is also about the joy of the sunset seen from a rock on the coast and a relaxing beer in your favorit pub in Balmora. No other game will in the same way take your thoughts away from the 'official missions' and into single player roleplaying.The manual with the game is small, why? Because if you want some information about the game world you should look in the bookstore _inside_ the game world. :) :) :)"
2,Over Rated - Try Dungeon Siege or Diablo,"While some of what they say is true, i.e. incredibly expansive universe, you can go where you want, so much to look at and do, etc.. the interface is just not that great. Movement is just to slow, takes forever to get from one place to another, quests send you back and forth to places and you waste time just walking from one place to the next. Combat is also kind of weak, not much fun. If you played Diablo, it was much better in that game. I guess I found the whole game just a bit ""clunky."" I have started to play Dungeon Siege, and that game is much better, better graphics, better combat, easier to use, etc. I was also a big fan of Diablo. I realize it may just be me, and many like this game, but I was dissapointed."
2,Wait at least a month to purchase,"I agree with everyone with 1-2 stars....this game was not ready to be released.It runs slow on 80% of all the game systems out there..no matter how powerful. It's a code issue that Bethesda is working on, in the form of a patch due about 3 weeks from today (5/20/02).The tough thing is that this game has some great potential- but even with a 1.7 Ghz processor, 20 GB of hard drive, 256 Ram, and a 64 MB video card the game is unplayable as is.Be aware of this if you decide to purchase!"
5,morrowind,game runs smoothly. no scratches or any other problems with either disk. all in all im completely satisfyed with it
3,Overrated,"Although the games graphics, depth, and sounds tend to be gorgeous, you will just find your self saving up gold to buy items for unexciting battles. All battles are are a mix of luck and what you have in your inventory. There is really no strategy and fun to be had in this area of the game. Otherwise, the game is a true representation of an RPG masterpiece. You can do just about anything you want. And a huge world to match. Besides the battles, great game."
4,This is the new era of RPG's,"This game gave me a new view of RPGs. RPGs are known for their story or plot but this game doesn't force to to proceed head first into the story instead you have time to make your mark in the world (for good OR bad)you can become a notorious thief or a well thought of nobleman. There is a certain way to enroll yourself into the story, but I don't know how. It has many opportunities to steal or help or become a mass murder of the populis(the guards are VERY hard to beat so i don't advise that) overall this game has one more difference First Person not so common with a sword and medieval game. This game is a must have for any hardcore RPGer."
3,A Solid Game,"The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind is an amazingly open-ended RPG where you can do anything. At the start of the game, the game gives you the basics you need to know to survive. But after that, you are on your own.The one major flaw with this game is the one feature that sets it apart from all other RPG's: It is too big! If you look around, the product descriptions will say that you can explore the different parts of Morrowind. But, there's not much too see, and it takes you too long to get there. Another major flaw is the graphics. Unless you spend hundreds of dollars upgrading your computer, the graphics will seem sketchy in some parts. A few other bugs include flawed combat and stat upgrade system and bad voice acting.There are many good things in this game, but I will not list them. If you are looking for a decent game that's not that hard and that you can finish in a few days, then you should buy this game."
1,Frustrating!!!,"The graphics are really impressive when it works. Three words of advice for those of you who haven't bought it yet: Crash, Crash, Crash. When you pick up certain Items; A message appears and states ""Your game will Crash Now"" click OK and the game crashes. I don't find the humor in scamming people out of hard earned money."
2,A word of caution,I can't truly rate this game because I can't play it. I have 2 cpu's and there is an issue with both video cards. Before you buy this game go to the game site to make sure that your video card is compatible with the game.
2,Another great game that might have been from Bethesda,"Like its predecessor, 'Morrowind' promises great things, shows potential for achieving those ends, and fails. The gameplay itself is superb, with open-ended character development and a large game world which allows for countless hours of exploration.And also countless hours of desktop crashes (which require a reboot), horrendous lag/framerate problems and everybody's favourite memory from 'Daggerfall,' the fall through the world. Actually, PRIOR to the patch, I didn't experience much by way of CTD, but now it occurs after about 15 minutes of game play, and without fail. Maybe in 6-12 months the game will be sufficiently patched to achieve stability, allowing me to return to the wonderful world-setting Bethesda has created. Until then, however, the CD will have to collect dust. Even with a high-end system configured to run this game efficiently, I have yet to be able to experience ""Morrowind"" without extraordinary frustration and disappointment."
5,Enthralling,"This game is amazing. It offers a huge world, lots of chracter customization, an interesting main story, and dozens of side quests. There's a simply a staggering number of things you can do and experience in this game."
5,Great game and great fun,"This game is probably the penultimate game of ever. I have played hundreds and hundreds of games, but this one takes the cake. You can go where you want, do what you want, and reap the reward or the ramifications. If you get bored with one story line, pick up another. If you get bored with that one, go back to the first one, or pick up another one. It's all up to you. The graphics are great, (would be better without the fog) and the story is a little shallow, (you will understand just who you are from the first few hours of play) but rich with detail.I strongly reccommend this game."
5,"Very dyanimc, expansive","Morrowind is one of the most dynamic and expansive game worlds around. While there is a centeral series of missions in Morrowind, the game branches out with a seemingly infinite array of options. The map is expansive, and the scenery is gorgeous. At every turn, you'll find new oppurtunities, dungeons, quests, shipwrecks, and other perils (but not without rewards). The game has a high replay value. You can't simply follow a straight line through the map to complete the main story quests unlike many games of this age. Its akin to Dungeons and Dragons, without having to meet up with your friends to play. The game also has the TES Construction Set, enabling anyone to create ""plugins"" which modify the main game world in some way. People have already added new dungeons, continents, as well as useful items such as homes and banks. Morrowind is a good investment for those who can appreciate fantasy games."
3,Morrowind,"It's actually an entertaining game. The advantages are that you can do almost whatever you want in this game, but you also have to face the consequences just like in the real world. The disadvantages are that it's almost impossible to survive. Your money runs low if you try to buy enough armor to protect yourself. Going from place to place...if you take the siltstrider it requires money, but it's the safest way. You run out of money and then you have to go to other towns by foot and that can be very dangerous."
2,Personal Dissapointment,"The graphics are impressive, however, when interacting with other characters a window pops up and you basically have to read and click as a means for interaction. There is a main window with text that represents the response of the character you are interacting with, and on the right there are headings that read rumors, where are you from, etc... I find this interaction to be totally archaic so I was totally unimpressed by this gameplay. Also, after you have clicked on all of the options on how to communicate with the character and you click on goodbye, as you are leaving the character will say, ""Can I help you"", or something to that affect. Didn't I just exhaust every question with this guy? What else do I need to speak about?Also, the fighting in this game is really dissapointing. You hit then he hits, you hit then he hits...get the point? Yawn....I believe this game would have been the greatest game ever made if it came out ten years ago.Definately try before you buy."
3,Toonami,"Toonami made a review of this game. They said its complicated, but I dont think any more than Neverwinter Nights is. They said it would littterly take days to get some of your charicters on foot, and it would take so long to finish the game you might not care long enough to see how it ends."
1,what the #%^#$^,"After all the hub bub of great reviews. I've played just about every fantasy game out there and this one bites big time. It's slow, ponderous boring unimaginative. Played for an hour and was hoping that the store would take it back. For fifty bucks I think I'd rather have someone give me a flogging. Anyway, the graphics are okay, they slide all over the place and are really inaccurate. Very blocky looking, its a 3D game of the genre of 3D games from 5 years ago. If you want fantasy or roleplaying stick with Ice Wind Dale or the like, or Everquest or something. Save your money and get a game that you will enjoy and have fun with. If you buy this game well you'll want your money back and since the game cd is fine there is no refund. Sorry you're out fifty bucks. I can't say enough negatives of the game, I've seen and played alot better before and all the ""great reviews"" are from the company not from consumers. Belief me no-one I know that has played the game likes it at all."
4,Huge game,The game world is huge. If you like first person and rpgs then this is a must. Excellent graphics. Many skills. THe ability to enchant your own items. Create your own spells. And tons of quests. Get the expansion too and you'll have lots of gameplay.
5,Great Game,Pretty much the title says it all. This game is evolutionary. It have already set the standard for all role playing games have to be. The open game play is a get idea. The player doesn't have to play the main story. You could do anything you want in this game its your chose.It is recommend for you to get the book. Its extremely helpful on finding where you need to go and what do to. The game doesnt really do a great job in helping you.
3,Daggerfall is MUCH MUCH better!!!,"all the other reviews talk of how HUGE the world is in this game but it is extremely small when compared to its predecessor Daggerfall. Dgrfall had about 9 or 10 provinces in it with hundreds of cities in each province. Mrwind is only that one stupid little island with stupid/short dungeons. In Dgrfall i literally had to start over because i would get lost in the dungeons for weeks. i still enjoy playing Dgrfall. The graphics in Morwind are definitely superior, but that is all it has. I killed a few guards and now my character can't walk into any town without getting the ... beat out of him. in dgrfall, all i had to do was go to another province and things would be all right. dgrfall is a much much better game and i would highly recommend that as the best rpg game ever. morrowind has amazing graphics but the world is too small and not enough creatures."
1,Bethesda Softworks tech support forum,"...I urge anyone considering buying this game to read through [The official Morrowind tech support forum ]. In its current state the game is horribly bug-ridden, to the point of being unplayable on many computers that should be more than capable of running it. Bethesda Software... refuses to admit some of these bugs even exist."
2,Why release a half finished game,If you are plannig to buy this game check out the elderscroll.com forums first to see the thousands of frustrated people that can't get this game running. The graphics and gameplay are next generation but the programming leaves a lot to be desired. Buy Might and Magic 9 instead
3,Should've saved my money & bought Dungeon Siege,"I bought this largely because of all the rave reviews, thinking it would be much like Dungeon Siege, only better. (I played the DS demo). There is no demo available for Morrowind so I decided to take the risk. Beginning play is excellent as are the role playing aspects of the game and the graphics are fantastic. However, action/fighting is and should be an important dynamic in an RPG game and this is where Morrowind falls short. After a while, the game becomes agonizingly slow and rather boring due to the lack of decent combat aspects of the game. Like another reviewer before me said, there is little or no skill required and movement is limited. Also, you will find that you will walk yourself to death. I found it very disappointing, given the hype."
2,Disappointing,"I wanted to like this game. I really, really wanted to like this game. I was a huge fan of Daggerfall and spent countless hours playing that game. I expected more of this game.* The world graphics are amazingly realistic, but are drab in color.* The NPC's are lifeless and drone like. The world feels very empty and dark.* Soo many things seem to be randomly generated or at least created with no uniqueness. Names, dungeons, items.* The Character models are all ugly. When I say ugly I do not mean bad artwork, I mean (If I met this guy on the street I would jump)ugly. They also all seem to suffer from bolemia or anarexia.* Missions and quests are uninspiring"
2,"looks good on paper, on pc it is unimpressive","I have played this game a grand total of 20 hours. While my computer is above the suggested requirements, the gameplay tends to be slow and stodgy, with frequent pauses for the game to catch up. It has also crashed 4 different times. I have set it aside for now, because I would rather spend time more effectively in other games."
4,Better than most,"The people that are not happy with this game fail to give you any kind of alternative. This game has flaws in the types of creatures encountered and perhaps the method of level advancement but in comparison to BG it is really much better. The only thing BG has is a better party system. Morrowind is limited to one party member but has has a much more ""open"" storyline. You can do whatever you want with your character for as long as you want. The playing area is HUGE! I've been playing it for about a month and have only explored a quarter of the map. The encounters become a bit simplistic at higher levels but I can live with that. If you enjoy exploring and looting then this game is for you. If you want detailed encounters with NPCs then you should look elsewhere. I would say the NPCs are on par with BG (If you exclude the number of people in your party; Morrowind is a solo game). It's worth 30 bucks."
4,The best RPG to date,"There has been alot of grumble recently about how buggy this game is, but I can say that after 10 hours of strait playing I have had no crashes or anyother technical problems. Here is my configuration:amd 1800+ \266a chipsetgeforce 4 440 ddrWINXPSOUND BLASTER LIVEAs an avid gamer I would highly recomend before you load any next generation game on your computer, you should update all drivers for your computer and possibly do some maintance like defrage, scandisk, etc. The ONLY problems I found were a couple of broken quests where I completed the quest, but cannot obtain the reward becuase the NPC thinks I havnt done what was asked. Other than that, I could not ask anything more of Morrowind. This game is full of RPG satisfaction!!"
3,Smelly Book,"The book was in good shape, no tears, no coffee stains, etc. All the pages were there, and there was very little writing on the inside (All in pencil, as well) HOWEVER --- the book smelled SO BAD it took me over a week of using the newspaper and dryer sheet trick before was even readable. It stunk up the entire house when you opened it up. I can't even describe what the smell was..... bad Indian food maybe?????? (as in, spoiled food) Whatever it was, it made me almost throw up the first time I opened it. After I treated it, I simply took benadryl every time I had to read anything. :( Very disappointing."
4,Fresh modern stories,"It's hard to define the ""modern era"" of science fiction, but this anthology provides a good measure. The stories (originally published from 1981 to 2002) have a freshness, perhaps by asking questions about how we humans would react to future realities. These 17 stores are not hard on scientific details, but rather focus on human reaction. There are no rigid forms and Maureen McHughs ""Lincoln Train"" could be thought of as alternate history. Greg Bear's ""Tangents"" tells a story of a young boy interacting with an older experimental couple, and the boys reaching new worlds that the couple could only glimpse. Philip K. Dick (creator of Blade Runner) short tale of cat-kibble and boredom is easy to relate to. Orson Scott Card's ""Salvage"", perhaps updates the James Dean story of restlessness and homesickness. Less we think that the future belongs to the humans Terry Bisson's ""They're made out of meat"" puts us in our place. A great anthology!"
3,Review for Kindle Edition,"I enjoyed the stories in this book, but the editing was horrible. There were spaces in the middle of words all over the place. The title of Connie Willis' story was misspelled. There were line breaks in the middle of words. The list goes on.... I can get past a few editing errors, but there were so many that it made the book hard to read."
1,TERRIBLE instruction and POOR editing!!!,"I bought this book because it claimed to be a step-by-step instruction manual to building an entire website in Flash. However, it fails to mention that it is, in reality, a step-by-sometime-you-fill-in-the-blanks-yourself-step book that has not been thoroughly tested on its target market. I have learned several software programs thru self-study (MS-Project, Photoshop, and advanced Excel plug-in programs that would make a mathematician wince) so I am no amateur... this book is a let-down to what technology has to offer because of poor writing and poor editing. In the second chapter, their description of a task isn't even poor -- it is downright wrong! (The end result being that a butterfly doesn't appear to be ""flying, but changing shape in weird ways). I confirmed that this WAS NOT user error, but a mistake in writing. This was not an isolated case --- other times I had to ""guess"" my next step! Bottom line: don't waste your money."
3,"Numerous Typos, Missing CD Files, But Still Helpful","I bought this book because it claimed to walk you through the process of creating a full flash website. The way I usually learn is to just do it so it seemed great, especially for the price. Unfortunately, there are numerous typos, skipped steps, and missing files on the cd. The way I found it useful was by reading and getting the basics of flash site development. I used what I could from this book in conjunction with what I found on www.flashkit.com. Now I have everything I need to get my work done. Being a developer requires you have thinking skills, so anyone with a little experience with development should be able to figure it out. If you can't, maybe you should consider something other than flash development."
1,No good,Do not waist your time. This item is too big.. people on the other phone can not listen to you. Very old design
2,Not as expected,Ok the movie has some nice stunts but it reminds me to much of a motorcycle jack ass version. Hot woman and nice bikes is the only reason why i watched it till the end. Other than that its not worth the purchase.
1,Call of the Wild,"The book was wonderful. I was looking forward to showing the movie to my class, the one with Charlston Heston. It is really bad, does not stay with the book, bad editing, very bad acting, except by the dog. The class and I were disappointed."
4,Good read and good eats,The commentary within this book is a good read and accurately depicts the great food that can be had on the streets of the med. the recipes cover the sea shores east to west and north to south.
5,Must have for recovery library,This is an extremely insightful book for anyone that is in recovery from addiction/alcoholism AND for anyone that works in the field of chemical dependency. The book explains very complex scientific information in a way that makes it accessible and understandable for the layman.
4,Under the Influence: A Guide to the Myths and Realities of Alcoholism,I haven't finished it yet. It was suggested reading for my Substance abuse curriculum for which I am studying. Thanks.
4,very informative and to the point,"I would reccomend this book to anyone who knows they, or someone they care about is an alcholic. I had to read this for my boyfriend who is currently going through his Divirsion classes. (AA) It helped both of us realize the seriousness of this disease. THUMBS UP!!"
2,I expected better...,"Although much of what was presented in this book was valid, I found the tone of the book to be extremely one-sided. I was hoping for more of a ""whole-istic"" book that presented a more complete picture of alcoholism. Yes, alcoholism IS a physical malady; however, the author's insistence that it is ONLY a physical illness weakens his presentation. Clearly alcoholism is a very complex problem and one that is multifaceted. But while the physical aspect is of unmistakable significance, genetics and psychology are of equally significance factors in alcoholism as well. By refusing to even address the validity of other factors, the author becomes just as guilty of the narrow-mindedness of which he accuses others who fail to recognize the importance of the physical influence."
5,Saved my life,"I never hit the bottom and I never drank in the morning and I never missed work, yet this book clarifies this baffling disease. It resonated with me and struck such a deep chord, I know I can never drink again. This moderation management stuff is bull dinky. This book explains the progressive nature and sneakiness of this disease. I'll never understand with my brain this disease anymore than I'll understand why a light bulb goes on when I hit the switch, but this book is the closest of read to explaining it. Get this even if you just suspect you have a problem. You could just be stage 1 or 2 as I was and if you don't act, you'll surely hit stage 3."
5,I recommend it to my counseling clients,"I wrote a cover statement for Milam's book and I always suggest to families of alcoholics to read it to understand exactly how the disease works on the body/brain.. it is excellent.... Toby Rice Drews, author, the ""Getting Them Sober"" books"
4,Necessary reading for anyone who thinks they may have a problem with alcohol...,and for their families who have the same suspicion. This book should be accepted by both those who embrace AA and those who avoid it. Simply learning how alcohol destroys one's body and mind could be a wakeup call for those in denial and especially for those sitting on the fence. The only drawback is that the book is a bit dated and would greatly benefit from an newer edition. Otherwise it is highly recommended.
3,"somewhat informative, but out-of-date","There is very little new information. Most of the information concerning alchohol as a disease, the self-administered tests and the case histories have all been covered before, although much of the information is pertinent. However, much of the science of alchohol addiction and/or abuse is evolving and this book does not include these new insights."
3,Biased approach presents only partial information,"I first this book around 1986. It presents very valuable information about the physiological processing of alcohol after it is ingested and how alcoholics process alcohol differently. The authors will leave the reader with no doubt that alcoholism has physiological origins. Moreover, the authrors are quite right to condemn the viewpoint that alcoholism results from either mental problems or moral failings. The authors' big and, I think, fatal error is their assertion that it is solely a physiological problem. This is nonsense. A wholistic approach views alcoholism as a biopsychosocial phenomenon. The approach of this book can't explain why an individual starts drinking in the first place. Moreover, the only adequately documented recovery approach with long lasting results is AA, which is a spiritual recovery. The underlying assumption, therefore, must be that alcoholism results from a spiritual failing. An interesting contradiction."
4,Greatful introduction to physiological alchoholism but...,"The only problem with this book is that it ignores one importantreason for alcoholism: psychologigal reasons. Millions of people have started their ""career"" as alcoholism because of psychological reasons: they have had psychologigal reasons that have started them to drink: divorece, loss of dear friend or job, depression, the list could go on and on.However there are fysiologically alcholized people and this book very well analyze their drinking career and its destructive power on his/her body and brain.One important point: these physiological vs psychological reasons for alcholism do NOT have to be reason for bitter fights. Just both sides of same coin so to speak. IMHO there are TWO kinds of alcholism: physiological and psychologocal and I really wonder why there should be just ONE proper explanation to such a complex problem as alcholism is. The most important thing is to try to help alcholized people, not to quarrel endlessly."
3,Just an Introduction,"This book is really good for just getting the most basic functions out of the way. However, don't expect to be able to do much more that the most basic functions, and, by all means, don't throw away your big manual. The price was exorbitant for such a thin book!"
4,Backup Exec is not sold as a multi-server version anymore,"Backup Exec is an exceptional software package with a wealth of straight-forward admin friendly functionality. Its only drawback, and one that they do not tell you when you buy it, is that Backup Exec is not sold as a multi-server version anymore. It is only sold as a single-server version. Then Veritas offers the ""Remote Agent"", which allows you to back up additional servers but consequently increases the actual cost of the software package considerably. This Remote Agent comes in a 1-pack (for one additional server), or a 3-pack (for three additional servers). You can order multiple Remote Agents to cover all the additional servers -but for a price."
3,I was disappointed.,"The horse is known to history as a foundation sire. I expected much more emphasis on his contributions to thoroughbred history (there are are no notes on who he sired, how fast they ran, what they won, or when his significance was noted, etc).There is a lot of dialogue, so to me this is not a true ""nonfiction"" work. It is an historical novel, well researched it seems, but it is not true nonfiction."
5,EAST PALO ALTO FLOWS,"DEFINATELY WORTH CHECKIN OUT,SMOOTH FLOWS DELIVERED WITH SRTAIGHT FIRE,ALSO CHECK OUT ""NEVA LEGAL"" FIRST ALBUM, LYRICAL WARFARE IS BY FAR THE BEST TRACK RECORDED PERIOD."
3,Monster Magnet - 'Heads Explode' (A&M) CD single,"I don't usually go much for CD singles,but since I'm a huge Monster Magnet fan,I thought I'd check this one out.It's the first single from their 2001 'God Says No' CD.Two different versions of the lp track ""Heads Explode"",a cut I've never seen before or I just don't remember ""Leapin' Lizards"" and their Stooges cover ""1970"".Well done,guys.Recommended if you're a Magnet fan."
1,Problem with airflow,"We have had this tv for nine months. It has continally shut down following a message that comes onto the screen saying that the tv will shut down automatically, please check for an airflow blockage. Just to test, we moved the tv out into the middle of an open room, but still receive the message and the tv shuts down. So, if you don't want to be in the middle of a movie, ballgame, or any other show, just to have your tv shut off and you cannot get it back on, we would not recommend this product. We regret purchasing this television."
5,Great Purchase!,I took about three months to decide on a new DLP. I had narrowed my search down to Mitsubishi WD series tv's. Specifically because of Texas Instruments color engine that is used in the newer models and the sleek profile of the tv. After a lot of browsing and price comparisons I decided on this model.The DLP performs as advertised. The clarity is amazing. The up conversion works very well. The universal remote is actually universal. I have six devices programmed. Nothing I had in the past handled them all. For a price tag of $1700 delivered to AZ from NJ I couldn't pass this deal up. Hands down one of the best purchases I've ever made.
1,Never Again,I have had this TV for 4 years and 3 months. I have regretted it ever since I got it. We purchased the TV for 1800$ after including an extended warranty and tax. The first time we replaced the light bulb was after only 4 months. Lucky for us Mitsubishi has a warranty in the first year. After that it was 11 months before we replaced it yet again. Now here I am for the 3rd time with a dead TV. I have no free bulbs left. i called to ask them why it wont last for more then a year. The customer support told me that the bulbs are only on average 1 year of life. Now I am being told I can purchase another for 250$. There is no written statement telling me I will need to replace it once a year. Now this has gone from 1800$ up to costing 2300 and refusing to replace the bulb AGAIN. I would not recommend buying this TV unless you love wasting money. I would have given it 0 stars if i could. I was forced to put one.
3,DLP,"Picture is great, problem with overheating. Do not put inside of cabinet if you don't want it shutting down every 10 mins."
2,Bad Color Banding,I have had this unit for a little over a year. It had the recalled problem with the temperature sensor and then managed to leak dust into the light engine. Getting past all this still leaves a tremendous color banding issue. The service guys say nothing can be done and Mitsubishi doesn't even answer.Went with the Diamond series as it was always the top-of-line. Wouldn't touch one again ever.
1,Nothing but problems,"I've owned this model TV for two years and have had to replace the lamp 4 times. The bulbs are outrageously expensive and can't be bought at any local stores. When the lamp blows, you need to order it and wait for it to be shipped. I've gotten to the point I keep an extra lamp around the house so that we can replace it in less than 5-7 days. When I contacted Mitsubishi, they suggested that I call a tech and see if there are any underlying problems. There is also several web sites about a class action suit against Mitsubishi so buyer beware!!"
4,Toad - 'B.U.F.O.' (Akarma),"An eleven track compilation of previously unreleased 1970 demos / re-edits by this little-known early '70's Swiss progressive rock{power trio}. I've heard this band's name mentioned{or seen them listed in CD catalogs} more often that I've heard any of their material. CD's title,'B.U.F.O' stands for -Blues United Fighting Organization-. Wish I could hear this disc again, for I've heard it just once {friend played it for me}. Tracks I was most impressed with were ""Pigs Walk"", both versions of ""Animal's World"", ""Walking In The Moonlight"" and possibly ""Life That Ain't Worth Living"". Some of these tunes are from their 1972 self-titled lp. I now KNOW I need to get my hands on more Toad. A good pick."
4,First volume of a superior set of early Brazilian rock,"""Jovem guarda"" was the name of Brazil's prefab early-'60s teen rock scene... This series is one of the stronger sets of this style of music, avoiding the wimpiness and bland pop vocals of similar collections on Polygram -- much perkier, Little Eva-style stuff. It's cute, but also fun!"
4,Modern outlook on a Dog's Life,This is a very moving story which makes a statement about our society from a modern dog's point of view.Sort of like Marley and me except told by the dog.
3,I really didn't need the book.,"I didn't use the book in class, but I'm sure it's a good book. I keep it for my library. I bought this book out of panic."
5,An Outstanding Book,"I recommend this book to anyone, gay or straight. The writing is top-notch, often hilarious, and always compelling. From beginning to end it will hold your interest and impress you. We'll be hearing from these authors in the future, I'm certain, and this is a wonderful opportunity to get in the ""ground floor"" of their careers. You won't be disappointed!"
3,"""So so.""","I guess this collection/book is ""all right"", but not particularly interesting, in that the stories seem to skip all the foreplay & set up & jump right into the sexual stuff. Maybe that's fine for some folks. There are some attempts to be ""literary"" but the efforts fall flat for the most part. Overall, it is a disappointment."
4,Scotland meets Papua New Guinea,"I would describe this album as Eastern meets the bagpipes. If you've heard it then you know what I mean. With all the attention Enigma got in the early 90's, Dao Dezi found themselves with a recording contract and their work cut out for them with only a few synthesizers on hand. I'd recommend this album if you like top40 electronic beats from 1992-93 mixed with an array of ethnic samples."
3,The missing mixes,"I dont mind the album, but was particularly wanting the advertised Ti eliz iza (Magic Carpet mix & Youth mix)both of which are not on the advertised CD. Can anyone help here with info?"
5,Fun Speakers!,"Unlike the other reviewer, I found the sound quality to be just fine. I bought the white version of this bear for my sons 5th birthday to use with his fisher price FP3 player. It works great. We listen to songs and stories every night with it. A nice feature this bear has is it gives you the option to turn the flashing lights off. The lights are fun during the day, but at night it's nice to be able to turn them off."
4,TRULY PORTABLE SPEAKER FOR AUDIO BOOKS,"I got the Brown Bear. The sound is great for listening to audio books. It doesn't have a volume control, so you need to adjust the volume from your MP3 player. My son uses it to listen to his juvenile audio books all the time. He just lugs it around from room to room, very convenient. This is designed for audio book listening. If you want great speakers for listening to music, consider the more expensive speakers that produce stereo sound. I'm very happy with this product; it beats using headphones all the time. It serves its purposes well."
2,"I'm sure it works, but........","I'm sure it works, but I still haven't learned how. The manual is not written for a novice. Others have said it will do what I want it to, so I will try to get it to perform."
1,No software available,"The book seems to have good intentions.. but... most of the text uses Mathematica Code that is not available... the promised software on the publishers Website is apparently vaporware.. totally unavailable.. and of course the publishers are ""not available""... Without software the book is an expensive waste of time..."
4,Good gift,Sheldon loved it but Penny had a hard time getting through the forward much less the abstract records and papers.
2,Not worth the price,"I have naturally curly hair and am always looking for shampoos designed for curly hair. I decided to try Ouidad PlayCurl because I'd had good results with Ouidad Water Works. Unfortunately, I didn't see anything special with PlayCurl. I get similar, or better, results using Paul Mitchell shampoos, which are much cheaper."
5,HG for my wavy hair!!!,I LOVE this poo...I use it on the days I want my wavy hair to be curly. It also helps with volume...just fabulous!
5,A small gigant,"This is a new brand not expensive and very good product,try it at least one time if you want to save some money,actually a lot of money for the same quality compare to Canon brand."
2,Look out people who have to file a state tax return!,"Amazon should put in big letters at the top of the description ""DOES NOT INCLUDE FREE STATE DOWNLOAD."" The title of the software matches up exactly with the product that the TurboTax website recommends for purchase for users with a need to file a state tax return. It does not say, nor does Amazon, that the State tax download is not included, nor does it tell that it will be 29.95 to purchase afterwards instead of the $5 that it costs upfront. I am now in the middle of a 45 minute hold with TurboTax (on Jan 24!) to get this fixed."
4,Turbo tax personal helper.,"I've been using turbo tax and macintax for the past decade.This is a reliable timesaver and moneysaver for yourtax declaration.I absolutely suggest anyone, like me, who can't even balance theircheckbook to use this tax declaration tool.You won't regret it..."
1,Unuseable! Still waiting for updates (over a month),"I have used TT for about ten years. Bot this one the end of January. After doing two kids' online (free) Started our joint return. Can't file due to no forms. Can't download update. Called for free CD middle of February. Today is March 22. Nothing. No followup. Called today and got automated system. Told to expect delivery ""in about two weeks.""!!! I will be lucky if I don't need to file for an extension! Too important to risk using again. Will not buy the CD ever again. May try online, but probably time to try different software. Too bad. It was great for a while. Fire the marketing department. $35 including a filing rebate will be fine. Two products: Home and Business will be fine. Restore the music. 2006 TT : F"
4,turbotax on the mac,"i installed this on a 1 ghz emac. the product seems very though but i still can't justify paying forty dollars for the product and then having to spend seventeen more dollars to efile, when i do all the work. so i print and snail mail my tax forms. i would recommend this product for anyone who needs tax software."
2,No Free State Download Included!,"Be careful selecting the version of TurboTax that you purchase. If it doesn't state ""Federal + State"" then you'll have to pay an additional $29 to download the forms for your state return. The ""Federal"" return version is only $5 cheaper than the ""Federal + State"" so if you need the state forms you'll end up paying $20 more total to buy the state to use with the ""Federal"" version than you would if you buy the ""Federal + State"" version.There are a handful of states that don't have a state income tax so those people can save $5 by getting the ""Federal"" version. So why does Intuit charge people with the ""Federal"" version $29 to download a state form package? People with the Federal version should be able to download their first state for $5 with any additional state downloads costing $29."
3,Getting Sloppy,"This program is good in general, asking all the questions it needs to to figure out what your best combination of deductions should be. But there were two critical flaws for me that made me decide not to use it again.First, they charge $40 for the product and then you discover when it's time to file online that that costs an additional $14.95. Why nickel and dime people?Second, Turbo Tax last year came with a free online version of deduction maximizer, to keep track of your donations. This year's version was not integrated with that one so I had to manually re-enter everything that I had typed into that program. The support had no work-around even though they should have known this was going to happen. That's just sloppy software development and bad support. Next year I'll spend my money elsewhere."
2,Great program; Slimmy Marketing,"I have used Quicken and TurboTax for over a decade, but will not next year. The products are very good, but the marketing (no sales programs) are so deceitful that I will move my accounting to Microsoft. I cannot believe that I find Microsoft less predatory than Intuit. Why would a company make a very good product and then develop a sales program that tick-off its customers? I would think that it would be a lot more profitable for them to keep existing customers than to make them feel like a sucker by adding additional costs to their services and promoting coupons and other discounts that they do not honor."
4,Makes quick work of an unpleasant task,"After my one and only trip to a well know tax preparation service that left me quite unimpressed, I decided the next year to use Turbo Tax and have been using Turbo Tax ever since. So far it has helped me understanding and handling inheritance, mortgage and even a side business. I've been a little disappointed of late to see the company move away from their original willingness to stand behind their product if users were audited, to an additional service fee. About my favorite feature is the option to create a PDF file for your tax return."
2,This book has a few errors,"HAHA! Ok, I'll explain why I am laughing. I have been working on this book and everything has been good until chapter 11 page 211. I remembered when I first bought this book, I read this comment and thought ""ok the guy (S.Brown) just doesn't know how to answer the problem"" I came on here looking for this comment to see if it was the same comment I had. That is why I am laughing. The author really does just give up after chapter 10! Although there are a few errors in this book, it's a pretty ok book. Considering I didn't even know my multiplication table before I started this book and now I can pass math tests easily. Yah! Except the graphing. Luckily I have three other math books that can help with this."
2,Another Book Leaving Out Important Details,"""Demystified"" is more like ""profoundly confusing."" It's just another book rushing through problems with little or no explanation. It really angers me that there are so many books like this that promise enlightenment but provide headache. Maybe it'll work for you, but if you're like me and REALLY need this stuff taught SLOWLY step-by-step (meaning no steps skipped), then try another book. Upon reading this book, I felt as though it assumed I had experience in the subject it was supposed to introduce me to. Try Painless Algebra by Lynette Long-while not flawless, it is the best I have used thus far and has brought me, a math loser, into the game."
2,"It's good, sort of.","There are some amazing and pretty cutting edge elements about the instruments used and their jam, and it feels very eclectic for a while, until they start using offensive and obnoxious audio bits. I truly can't figure out why they took that route. It is depressing, and instantly, the cd was not desirable anymore. My wife and I like eclectic, pretty wholesome, and damn-good-art type of music, and we really wish we could return this accidental buy."
1,Junk,"These batteries last less than half as long as brand name ones. In addition, they caused serious problems with my equipment. I used them with a Sonosax microphone preamp (a $1200 piece of equipment.) When they started to die I got a high pitched loud noise that ruined several recordings and the preamp clipped. This never happened with any other battery. They must be real junk to cause the preamp to clip when they die - as soon as I put a new pair, the noise disappeared, only to return after 2 hours, when the battery indicator showed ""low"" (they are supposed to last 5 hours on that preamp.) Dangerous junk is what they are."
1,not worth the few cents you might save...,"This looked like a pretty good deal -- about 15% cheaper than the usual batteries I buy, and Amazon wouldn't sell junk, right?Wrong. Two of the first three batteries I opened were dead. So I shipped them back, and won't be ordering these anymore."
1,batteries,Many were dead on arrival and others did not last. avoid like the plague. Unfortunately it was ayear before I needed them so I got stuck.
1,Leaky,Nearly half of these batteries leaked. The cleaning required after a few of these leaky batteries convinced me that they are just not a reasonable buy at any price.
1,AVOID,This brand is AWFUL. If you put ANY of their products in a tester when you receive them they will be lucky to not be already in the replace zone.
2,batteries,"not so sure about this..one battery was dead altoghether, another lasted just an hour and another 3 hours..working on number 4. if the rest are good i will be satistifed though, considering the qantity and the price."
2,Cheap but that's about it.,"I wanted some cheap batteries for my classroom and that's what I got. After I used them to make some conductivity meters, half of them didn't work anymore. I suppose you get what you pay for."
1,Definitely Not A Bargain...,"This product is definitely not as described and packaging was not good. The life-span of these batteries is comparative short. I did not expect their performance to be sub par, considering the 'Super Heavy Duty Battery Value"". I definitely would NOT recommend purchase/use to anyone."
1,Universal Battery,When a company ships a 12 pack of batteries with only 10 you know that you bought garbage. Not only did they not ship 2 the batteries are garbage too.
1,Poor quality here,These batteries won't last an hour in our wireless handheld mic where most batteries last several hours reliably. I do not recommend this brand - it appears to save but in the long run is more expensive than name brands.
2,"A guilty pleasure, but certainly not a quality film...","Any movie with Meatloaf, Randy Travis and Patrick Swayze in it is definately worth watching, at least for the laughs. In that respect, BLACK DOG certainly doesn't disappoint. The acting in this movie is terrible, especially Swayze's neverending wooden facial expressions. The plot is equally bad, and is never very engaging. However, the one thing that saves this B-movie from being so bad it's unwatchable are the scences with Meatloaf quoting Bible verses while trying to kill Patrick Swayze and the hilarious bits about the black dog. So, don't expect a quality piece of cinema, but if you're bored and need a laugh, it's worthwhile."
3,Dukes of Hazzard Meets Convoy,"Bad movie, great DVD.I dont remember them filming this in Charlotte. That must have been the day I was run over by an 18 wheeler downtown while a guy sitting way up on a boom with a megaphone in his hand hollered at me ""Get out of the way!!!!"" I usually remember stuff like this Ma, what day is it?haw haw haw OK, what happened to Patrick Swayze's nose? Did Meatloaf flatten the thing? And what happened to Meatloaf's Loaf anyway? Aint North Carolina pretty? Aint Patrick Swayze's wife pretty? Dont you wish you lived in New Jersey? And arent you glad they cast the Insurance Salesman from Groundhog Day as an ATF agent? ""Ooooh that's a doooozy!"" He had more credibility than anybody except for the kid and she could play a kid better than the adults could play adults so I'm votin for her. Yeah, that's it.Very good transfer, and 5.1 audio that will blow you away, to hell with the neighbors.,,,crank it. No extras to speak of, great soundtrack. 3 AK's"
2,Beyond silly,"I watch (and love) zombie movies, so my ability to suspend disbelief or to enjoy mindless mayhem is extremely high. I don't even mind Mr Swayze in the right film. Red Dawn or Point Break? Watch them anytime. Road House or Next of Kin? Well, maybe not all the way through, but I can always make it to the next commercial break if I'm channel surfing and I see one of them. But this is so absurd, with such endless data dumps where Mr Swayze has to explain to the other characters his own back story or the inner workings of truck brakes (yawn on both counts), and with villains who are beyond comic relief to being just Darwin award winners, that it's impossible to sit through."
5,"""Black Dog"" is Pure Genius","Patrick Swayze is back! What kind of a genius would put Meat Loaf and Randy Travis in a movie together? This movie has changed my life. You say 'no', but I say YES! It was a cinematic experience to remember forever. Throw in Charles S. Dutton and you have gold. Pure genius."
5,Great fun!,"This movie is fun, no doubt about it, but don't look to it for Oscar winning performances. It's all masculine fun, corny jokes, and impossible action, with a human-interest element thrown in. In that respect it's not a lot different from, say, Roadhouse. But I really love this movie for the big trucks! Most of the action happens over a long haul from, I think, Georgia to New Jersey.In the end: I kept renting this movie so often, I finally decided to buy it, and I'm glad I did. I love this movie!"
1,Pirated copy?,My DVD player won't read the thing. I want to watch this movie. It's my favorite! I hate that I can't watch a movie I paid for.
1,Botched Video,"I was very dissappointed in the technical quality of this video. Having already seen this film, I was very disturbed to find the first 20-30 minutes of the movie deleted. There were scenes that did not appear in the movie. For instance, there is a scene that takes place between Swayze and his wife that discusses his taking the job. This scene was deleted. I'd like an explanation for this. This purchase was made as a X-mas gift. Fortunately, the person who saw it was totally clueless about the deletions, but I was not. This will definitely cause me to question the quality of Amazon videos in the future.Regretfully,Avis Gray"
4,It's Not Gonna Change The World,"Sometimes you've got take a movie for what it is and what it is meant to do. Although I notice a majority of the reviews here are positive, some people just don't get it.This is a fun, action packed 2 hours(approx.)The DVD widescreen transfer is awesome and the 5.1 audio will blow you away!!The only thing I have to say negative about the movie is the ending. Kinda leaves ya goin' ""Huh?, That's it? Okay..""Check it out."
4,Swayze & Travis Deliver The Goods,"My wife & I saw this picture in the theatre when it came out. Not sure what its impact is on the small screen, but this was a fun movie & action packed. The inclusion of the ever-charming Randy Travis was a bonus. Meat Loaf's cameo was a bit cliche'd (typical, canned Hollywood stereotype of the scripture-quoting religious psycho. We can do without this.) & may offend. If you can get past this, it's worth seeing."
5,Serious truckin'....,"A seriously good time for action-oriented rednecks like myself BUT the soundtrack lives on way after the thrill of the flick is gone...any serious cross-country trip should include this collection. When you're out there ""somewhere west of Omaha"" punching holes in the dark and need some truckin' music this soundtrack gets it on! Chris Knight gives you a shot of audible caffefine with ""If she could just hear the SOUND of the Hammer Goin' DOWN...........""! It's worth the price just to hear Rhett Akins' DO ""Rainy Night"". Yeah! Just a whole bunch of ""catch a gear and get on down the road"" tunes on this one! Yessir, when you're out there on the Big Road and you wonder where are all these trucks coming from and going to and why are they doing it.....Gary Allen tells it all with ""I'm a highway junkie, man and I NEED that old white LINE!""! Gotta have it...lock and load and get some!"
2,WHY?,"THIS FILM IS ENTERTAINING WITH SOME INCREDIBLE AXCTION SEQUENCES. HOWEVER,THE FILM GETS RUINED BY THE BY-THE-NUMBERS CLIMATIC SHOOTOUT THAT WE'RE ALL SO USED TO (THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH CLIMATIC SHOOTOUTS IN SOME MOVIES,BUT THIS ONE SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD ONE) AND THE KIDNAPPING SUBPLOT. TOO BAD I CAN'T GO BACK IN TIME AND GET THE FILMMAKERS TO CHANGE THE SCRIPT."
1,Kill me now!!,"This movie is terrible. You could easily put this in the comedy section of movies. The positive reviews for this movie makes me doubt the future of humanity. All I can say is if you have any brain cells in your head, avoid this garbage. May GOD have mercy on the writers soul."
2,No brains and no fun,"Patrick Swayze is Jack Crews, a good man and ace trucker who lost his license and did some time over a manslaughter beef; now he just tries to make ends meet and keep a roof over the heads of his wife and daughter. He agrees to run some guns to make the mortgage payment and from that point on he's in trouble up to his neck. Obviously, this is a stupid movie, but that needn't preclude it from being fun. Unfortunately, it's just boring for anyone who isn't a member of the monster-truck crowd. For high-octane highway mayhem, rent ""The Road Warrior"" instead."
4,Want to be market-oriented?,"This book started with some basic management concepts and marketing concepts such as organizational structures to give you basic ideas on an organization. Then, in the latter chapters, the author introduced the concept of ideal market-based enterprise and brought in the ways to become a market-based enterprise. The Listen-Learn-Lead approach suggested by the author is practical and easy to understand. I love that approach personally since it would be useful for my future career.As the author possess over 30 years executive experience, you can definitely share his experience in this book. As in this cyber year, the market trend always keep changing, thus being market-oriented is essential to maintain competitive. This book is worth to read if you want your organization to be market-oriented."
5,Try CRAZY IVAN if you liked this book,"If you liked this book, be sure to get the new book CRAZY IVAN: A TRUE STORY OF SUBMARINE ESPIONAGE by W. Craig Reed available today on Amazon.com. Type in CRAZY IVAN under Book Search on this page and order your copy today!"
5,Library Collection,This 8 volume set covers all cultural treasures of Korea with scholarly articles and vivid pictures. All kind of libraries should have this volumes in their collection. A wonderful publication. See the book review of CHOICE.
4,"Some Halloween ""Celtic"" reading for sure!",I just finished reading this book the other day. I loved it. The stories are well written - short and thought provoking. This book inspired me to want to learn more about Pagan Celtic traditions and stories. The Cover though fitting to the mood -doesn't do the book justice.If you have a friend who liked the show Tales from the Crypt - this might just be a neat gift to get them!
5,lucid news,"It's great to see the brillaint reviews. Just to let everyone know the boys are still doing their stuff and have recently remixed Jakatta's - ""American Dream"". Keep your ears peeled for new material. For any futher info contact me."
5,I Love Awesome,"I love this CD. The writing, the music and the lyrics. The new Tempts have it all together. There is some of the Classic Five in their music but the new lineup bring their own style to the CD. If you buy this Cd, I guarantee that you will love it too."
2,I beg to differ; NOT the Tempts I used to know and love,"I don't think you could find a bigger, more honest fan than I am regarding the Tempts. Over the yeays I have loved their every move, album, song, etc, with the exception of AWESOME. I did not think it was awesome at all. Now ""For Lovers Only"" was truly awesome, but this one left me missing the powerful leads of Ali Ollie Woodson, Dennis Edwards, and David Ruffin -- all very capable of rendering distinctive readings. But nothing on this CD comes close. I recently bought Woodson's solo CD and feel he should have stayed with the Tempts. They really need him now and he needs them. .... These are NOT the Tempts that I have known and loved. Save your money and do not buy this CD."
4,((Sigh)),"Not the TRUE Tempts, but that's neither here nor there...There is no doubt that these guys CAN SING, but my MAJOR gripe is whomever WRITES for them needs to REMEMBER that these men are MATURE in age and NOT 20-something!!! The cd is ok, but when I hear them sing a lyric that they are too old to be singing, I cannot take them seriously. I do like Hurt So Bad--despite the lyrics, and 4 Days, Lady, and So Easy.I would rank this cd after Legacy and Ear-risistable and Phoenix Rising."
2,"Not the quality that I was expecting, but some redeeming qualities.","The beads on this necklace are very small and lightweight; they feel like plastic beads rather than stones. The necklace is also very short, so in general it reminds me of a little girl's play jewelry. However, with the right look it is still cute - just don't expect high quality. I do like the color. Also an important note: I almost returned this because I thought it had no clasp and it wouldn't fit over any adult's head. When I looked more closely, I noticed that two of the beads screw together and this is how it opens. That works to my advantage because I have an allergy to a lot of metal clasps, so for me the feature is a plus. If you have metal allergies, this necklace will work for you."
4,It helps---sometimes,"Plenty of us are still using older version of Microsoft software, and if you're one of those this guide is as good as any. You may spend a little time searching for the answer but it's usually hidden somewhere. The book is helpful in steering neophytes away from fancy but overly complicated or even risky features."
3,nothing special,"If you are not a fan from Charlelie Couture who wants to collect all of his recordings, you could skip this one. (At least in my opinion).It's a nice album, no bad songs, but the peaks are missing as well. It's pure pop music which you can hear from a lot of other bands and except for the lyrics, the is no special ""french"" in this recording.I love the music of Charlelie Couture because it is a very individual mixture of pop, rock with some slight influences of french chanson, blues and jazz elements. But it is my feeling that everything that makes his music special, different from other music is missing in this recording.You find all of the songs on this recording also on the live album 3 Folies live (where he just performs his two albums Solo Boys and Solo Girls live on stage). This live album is worth a listen, but the most beautiful or interesting songs on this album come from the album Solo Girls and not from Solo Boys."
2,"The main arm is too long unless you are 6'5"" tall",This design must be for very tall guys...it hurt to use it until the main arm was reduced in size...the perineum arm is not exactly right either....the Aneros is a much better design; although it is not motorized...the Prostate Massager by Quanta Technologies is the best all around motorized prostate massager.
3,Not bad.,"It's an older game, so it's obviously not as fancy or feature filled as what's out now. But it's still a fun game. It's worth a play through."
1,Warning - edited tracks,"Let me just say that if you are looking for a collection which includes ""Radar Love"" -- keep looking. The version K-TEL put on this CD has been gutted like a fish. Records need warning labels, but not for obscenity, rather for rip-off content. K-TEL should be ashamed."
5,"It really is a ""Heavy Hitting"" Cd!!",This is the kind of Cd that you can throw in your stereo and not be concerned about skipping over mediocre songs. Just let this album keep on spinnin'! This compilation is worth well more than what Amazon is asking. Buy it!
1,Enlightenment? No.,"As a teen, I can say this book was NOT sanity-saving. My parents taught me one good thing: if you don't have any thing nice to say, don't say anything at all."
5,Fan from the UK,"The Lift album offers a vibrant range of uplifting music with great vocals and instrumental sounds. The actual words throughout the Album have a common personal and in depth meaning which are sung in a very intense manner. Great Album and great live show making the FIXER band a strong hit...would love to see them in London.Great showing guys, keep it up...lots of taelnt here"
5,Huge debut!!,Keep your eye balls on this new hot New York band. Wilson's guitar licks are pure talent backed up with cosmic drums. Evan's vocals at times bring to mind the best of Axl Rose unplugged. This debut CD rocks!! Original tunes. Look forward to following this new band as they break out to rock stardom!
4,Rock & Roll!!!,"Whoever has said rock & roll is dead, hasn't seen young Evan Saffer on stage. While the band is still perfecting their sound (which every good evolving band should), their live show, led by Saffer is incredible! Proof that rock & roll is alive and well in NYC..."
1,Garbage,"The book should be in the fiction category. If you like PC you will love this junk. He credits the silver and gold from S.America as causing slavery. Here is a sample...""Overweight women flapping along in little rubber thongs pull on the arms of bored children sticky with melted ice cream as the camera-carrying father of the family dutifully records his children against the backdrop of this living history tableau on the shores of Lake Superior."" p. 27. If you like non-sense, you will love this book."
4,good read,Indian Givers has so much information about the American Indians and as usual what we could have learned from them. It's a great history read. It compares to Lewis and Clark in Undaunted Courage. If you like learning about history in a non painful way this is a good book to read. Also read it for a book group and a great discussion afterwards.If there was one thing I did not like about the book was the persecution of the Indians ( not a whole lot the writer or I could do about that!)
5,Great Quality Book!,"Thank you so much for selling me this book. The delivery was quick and great quality. The book is in excellent conditions. I was actually worried that I would not get the book on time for my Native American history class, but it came just on time. The price was very reasonable. I have no complaints to make to you. I would recommend any body to buy the items you are selling. Thank you very much for everything!"
4,Good Reading,"I purchased this book for a class I'm taking. I've only read chapters 1-3 and so far the reading has been excellent. You can tell the author did his research. Too bad the world doesn't give the credit for its ""civilized ways"" to those natives already living in the Americas when Columbus arrived."
3,Don't know what's true.,"This is a good book, and like previously stated by another reviewer, it is an easy read. However, I just see too many errors throughout the pages of this book. I love any good history book as I'm working on my MA in Latin American Studies. But, this book, for all its good qualities, makes some far-fetched assumptions with neither the data nor the facts to back it up. A lot is said in this book that should have been said a long time ago, but over crediting doesn't help the situation. Basically, if I wrote this as a thesis paper, I'd be laughed at and told to try again."
3,This book loses objectivity a lot,"Weatherford's book suffers from frequent lapses to romanticizing. However, its strength comes from many useful historical tidbits and historical perspectives (however questionable some may be). Worth a read, but fails to deliver a strong revisionist approach."
4,Good book,"I am very pleased with this product. The price was very fair, and the packaging was very nice as well. Thank you"
3,Don't Get Mixed Up,"Don't get mixed up! Somehow, the pages with the reviews of the A Little Night Music LIBRETTO (only words) and the PIANO/VOCAL SCORE (only music) are the same. Also, if you try to get this on the Kindle, the only available option is the Libretto. I found this out the hard way when I mistakenly ordered it expecting the score. While I was mildly upset to find out I was missing the music, I'm not entirely ruined, because now I have access to some of the great scenes from the show. However, beware, and really check before you buy to make sure you are getting the version you want."
2,misleading,"I really thought I was getting a score. This is NOT a score. This is a libretto only. A previous review by a customer was misleading, and the description of the product not clear. This is NOT a score. No music, only lyrics."
5,Do not miss this movie,I am so glad that I found this movie. It is very cleverly written romantic comedy that had me laughing for two hours. This is as good of a movie as I have seen in a long time. Highly recommended to anyone who watches movies.
3,SHE'S MY SOUL MATE,"The movie attempts to be cute and clever by feeding us unrealistic characters. Jake (Jay Jablonski) owns a fish store in Boston. He is still ""in love"" with his ex-girlfriend (Marisa Petroro) and soul mate of 8-12 years who is now married with 3 kids. This is the first joke that didn't work, unfortunately they made it part of the story. Jake's Italian friends fixes him up with a woman (Cerina Vincent) who they think is Italian. Neither one is Italian but pretends to be Italian because they believe the other one is Italian. That was the whole premise of the title and the second joke that didn't come off well. Jake is so confused about his feelings, he becomes unlikeable and pathetic.I didn't find the movie to be funny, or heart warming and neither did my ex-girlfriend and soul mate.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity 3 stars is pushing it."
3,Everybody Wants to be Italian,"It was only ok. It was not as funny as My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Most people only get it if they are Italian. An OK ""date"" movie."
5,This movie is terrific,"You will absolutely fall in love with Cerina Vincent. She is the one who gets introduced to Jay Jablonski. He likes her and she him. But he's still in love with a former girldriend, Marisa Petrono. These two ladies play their roles perfectly. Is Cerina a ""doctor"" (she's a verterarian), but does she have a boyfriend already? Cerina invites the fish monger to a dinner of intellectuals. Jay doesn't want to go but the result will surprise and please you, as it did him. The movie and Cerina Vincent both get 5 stars from me."

4,CD Portable Player car kit,I believe I already sent in a response. I have not used it except to try it out and it worked fine.
2,Review,"The adapter, which allows you to connect your CD player to your car's stereo system, worked fine and I am completely satisfied with it. The CD player is a different story. It repeatedly would not recognize disks (that worked fine on a different player), or would read a disk for a while but then stop, just generally very poor reliability. I didn't return it, as the adapter was what I needed the most and I had another CD player that worked fine. My advice is to buy the adapter by itself and then get a different CD player."
4,"It's better than just a tape deck, by far.","It works very well. It's nice to be able to listen to CD's in my car without getting a whole new stereo system installed. My only problem is that the CD player will turn off every once in a while when the power cord is bent. This happens rarely, but it's enough to be a little annoying. Other than that, it's a very nice product. No skipping, easy to use and a fair price."
4,No problem,Received the player in record time. It does the Job. No Problems. Would recommend it to anyone.
4,Great little CD player,"I wanted something for my car as I still only have the old tape deck.. I have never experienced any skipping with this player,,, the ease of use is great. It never slides around on the seat or anywhere I place it.. it has great sound with the car adapter provided with player. I would recommend this to anyone wanting an inexpensive player that really works great!!!"
4,Enhance Your Performance,"Coleman tells us we can be creative and he goes on to sell the idea of the benefits of living such a life. Patterns of thinking can be changed, which in itself is an act of creativity. This book talks about creativity in the practical application sense. He talks about taking immediate action.Attitude is necessary in the process. Chapter seven talks about the creative attitude. He couples laughter with creative output. He issues a warning, ""People who are bedrock complainers can scarecely venture into the creative arena."" This is an instruction, encouaging book."
1,"""new"" Cheesoning tastes terrible",We have been using Reeses Cheesoning for about 15 years and buy it by the case. I was so excited to find it on Amazon but super disappointed when we tried it and it is absolutely not the original. I checked the ingredients and there are a few changes that unfortunately changed the flavor dramatically. I HATE it and too bad I bought 2 cases. Oh well you live and you learn. i will contact Reeses to see if I can recoup some of my loses.
5,"Reese Cheesoning, 3-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)","I love it. My sister in law loves it. My mother in-law and father in-law love it. We put it on Popcorn, french fries, vegetables, hamburgers, etc. I have had my friends from school try it and they all think it is great."
1,All You Taste Is Salt,Save your money. This cheesoning has Way To Much Salt. It ruin's the flavor. Will not buy again. zero stars.
4,Reese Cheesoning Seasoning,This popcorn topping's unique blend of seasonings and cheese is ideal for the popcorn aficianado. I was so grateful to find it online after searching for several months in my neighborhood grocery stores who no longer carry it.
1,Ghosting is a problem,"I have been using this flip for 3 months. At first it ghosted when I flipped to my laptop. The ghosting wasn't that bad (ghosting, per the tech support guy at Belkin is minor shimmering of everything on the monitor...). Anyway I have put up with it for the convenience of having one keyboard and mouse. Lately however the ghosting has turned into barely legible and has created other strange problems. I would like my money back from Belkin but doubt that will happen. They are really big on just trading out a ""defective"" product regarless if it is defective design. Anyway that is the short condensed version of my flip story."
4,Compact and reliable,Works fine with my Logitech wireless set but it's neccesary to switch the KVM before turning the computer on. I guess the keyboard-mouse emulation doesn't works very well. One of the set of cables is a little bit short.
3,Hard to start.,"The product works great once both computers are up and running. The problem is starting the computers. The first one to start does not recognize the keyboard and mouse so I have to click on ""delete"", then ""escape"", then click on ""yes"" to get my Windows XP computer to start. Then my Windows 7 laptop will start ok. I cannot start the Windows 7 laptop first or the switch will not work."
3,"Does The Trick, with Some Annoyances","Using this thing on certain systems can produce audio burps and buzzes that will make you dive for the power cord. Generally, though, it does the job. I don't think I would want to use one of these items as part of my primary system.This review has not been paid for nor approved by Belkin."
3,Works great if you dont have windows 98,This switch works great if you done have windows 98 because it can't detect your keyboard or mouse for some reason (my guess is a drivers issue) if you want to switch between screens you double tap scroll lock and press the arrow up key for one or down arrow for the second connection.
4,Works great,"Just what I needed to switch back and forth from my kids 98 pc and my xp pc. Worked right away, no issues."
2,Simply OK!,"If you are truly devoted into learning about Albania, this book might be a bit of a disappointment. But, if you really have to have it, don't expect too gain much out of it. If you really want to learn about Albania, its people, culture, history, and politics you should then look at some of the other titles on Albania that Amazon has in stock. This book does not have much valuable insight on Albania. The book for the most part is very brief and gives the reader just a quick introduction on the country. Even with that, the brief introduction on Albania or the profile that is presented for the country is not very good. I would not even recommend this book for elementary school students. Save your money and find something else!"
5,great hand lens!,"As a professional botanist, I use a hand lens every day. This is high quality, with a large field of view."
5,Perfect for even the amateur,"I am new at using a loupe. We are going through my late mothers jewelry and trying to figure out what we have. I am always leery of buying something I know little about, but this loupe works very well and does a fantastic job at viewing those small markings that are invisible to the naked eye. It feels solid and not cheap. I do wish it came with a case for storage but I am completely pleased with the item itself. The viewing area seems large enough where you are not straining to see. And you can wear it around your neck and take it with you if you are ""hunting"" at rummage sales. I believe you'll be pleased with it."
3,Don't be fooled...,"it ain't at all easy. This interface is not user friendly. There are a multitude of features that require extensive practice to use effectively. Unlike many software programs, there is no ""undo"" command, so once you've messed things up, you have to start over again. The tutorials are amateur, and the printed quick start guide assumes you are not a novice. I'm glad I bought it, but know it will take more than the four weeks I have had it to figure out how to make it worth the money."
3,Helps a little,"I ordered this hoping to improve my cell reception, well it did in deed help some but not alot. I still use it and it has helped, but just don't expect a dramactic increase."
5,Taking hip hop and Electronica to Another Level,The first time you listen to this album you will probably be in shock. It is a very creative and beautifully composed album. I have listened to this album over and over and I still love it.
5,"Yes, the REAL! ""Original Hits"", not that re-recorded junk.","Somewhere along the line K-tel stopped putting out the ""Original Hits"", but I can say this for sure everyone of these are. I have all three CD's in this set and the Original 2 LP K-tel release. You can forget about finding the 2 LP or 8-track sets in good shape now. So get your hands on all three CD's in this set before they are part of K-tel history. You can almost hear the original radio and TV AD's now... THE HIT MACHINE, 20 GIANT HITS, ALL ORIGINAL STARS! $5.99 FROM K-TEL, TAPE $7.99! MAKES A FINE CHRISTMAS GIFT!!!"
4,Great book !,The insights and tips you can learn from this book are still fresh after those years.I suggest also Persuasion Engineering by Bandler/La Valle.Francesco PattarelloLife Coach and Project Manager
4,Good and useful information,This book has a lot of good information that is well presented and relatively easy to understand. There is much that I will use going forward. I recommend it highly.
5,Brilliant exposition of the psychology of selling,"This book applies Ericksonian hypnotic techniques to the interpersonal sales process. It covers developing rapport through pacing, using stories and metaphors, eliciting criteria and developing script books amongst many more. This book is full of penetrating insights. If I had one book only on the interpersonal psychology of selling I would choose this. Chapter 10 on interactive audio and video training has such penetrating insights it is amazing it was written way back in 1990 before the web. I find publication lists populated with junk sales books (""101 best closes"" and such like). This book is not one of them. It is full of real substance. I wish I purchased it 8 years ago. The techniques they describe can be used in all interpersonal interactions, not only sales. If you have any comments please feel free to e-mail me."
4,Awesome!,"I first heard of Shawn Desman after watching the movie ""Honey"" featuring Jessica Alba. On a whim I bought the CD - i do not understand why he is not more popular in our country! Especially compared with a lot of current R/B artists out now, he is much better. Definitely a CD to enjoy!"
1,Disapointing,"The editing and printing are terrible. Photographs are cut off on the top and bottom of the page. Very little color is used in photos, mostly black and white. I was very disappointed overall."
5,Easy to install and works like a dream with the Xbox!,I have the older model of Xbox and needed more USB ports. This product has 3 ports and uses one so you basically gain 2 extra ports. I was concerned it might not work with my Xbox but gave it a shot and couldn't be happier with the product. All you need to do is plug this in to your Xbox and away you go! No software or anything else to install.
1,didnt work from package,This did nothing but red light since I got it tried all card slots and nothing would work for me.
5,"Great device, even for a non-gamer","This device is made to plug into an XBOX 360, to allow for input for 3 wired controllers. I don't have an XBOX, but I find this device valuable regardless.I use the Nyko Multi Reader 360 to add to the USB ports on my laptop, and as a SD media card reader. It performs great in both areas.I highly recommend it."
3,Limited Usage,"I have recently purchased this item. The USB Ports are great for offering expandability to the Xbox 360. However, I have tried several media cards (USB flash and SDHC) in this unit and none of them work with the Xbox 360. [...]This website spells out what you can and can't use with this device. I highly recommend that you visit this website before purchasing this product. I have also found that Microsoft has included restrictions in this system that prevent it from allowing the use on generic media cards and thumb drives. The perpose of this is to get people to pay $[...] for a 512mb drive from Microsoft.So if you are looking for a device that will allow you to plug-in a media card so that you can transfer data from one xbox or to a new hard drive, then this may not be what you need."
2,Problems.,"All three USB ports worked, but none of the card reading slots will recognize any imput. I can only use this as a USB hub, not a multi-reader."
4,First Rate Intro,An excellent introduction to the use of rhyme and meter to create emotional and intellectual content in poetry (and occasionally in prose).
3,Probably wouldn't buy these again,"The clipless part of the pedal is excellent, but the platform/caged part leaves a little to be desired. If I were wearing hard soled shoes, they would be perfectly fine. But if I'm just wearing flip-flops or other light weight summer shoes(I'm a female), they're not at all comfortable on the foot. The clipless part of the pedal raises up from the middle and you can feel it through your shoe. I certainly wouldn't want to ride more than a few blocks with that protruding into my foot. Next time around, I'll just buy regular clipless pedals."
1,A Guaranteed Leaker,"Recently I loaned a flashlight out to my neighbor. Upon its return one week later I could not get it to operate. After careful inspection I opened the casing and discovered Univeral Batteries leaking inside. My well intentioned neighbor informed me that he had purchased these batteries recently online and wanted to replace my Duracell batteries with fresh ones. We inspected his other battery powered tools and found multiple problems with the newly purchased leaking batteries. Without a doubt you indeed get what you pay for. My neighbor now owns a bad batch of Universal Brand batteries, several non functioning tools and a badly corroded Maglite flashlight."
1,Terrible Quality,"Not only it lasted one fourth of the time compared to Duracell, it leaked a lot of battery acid.Definitely will not buy again."
1,poor quality batteries,"I bought these batteries for my daughter's swing. They are really of poor quality, they lasted for only a week. I used Duracell batteries in the past, they lasted more than 6 months. I do not recommend anyone to buy these batteries."
1,ok quality for the price short life cycle,"some of the batteries right out of the package were dead, others are used in a (MAG)flash light used 3 nights for approximate 10 minutes each time and had to replace them. I won't buy these again."
1,bad camping experience,"We bought these batteries to go into our camping lantern. After 1 1/2 nights, they started leaking battery acid. Luckily we caught it in time. I'll never go cheap on batteries again."
5,Le Corniaud,"For people who loves COMEDEY, this is a big chance to laugh. Louis de Funes is one of the best comedeans I ever saw, he is full of humor. It is a must see."
2,Black Flags in Viet Nam: the story of a Chinese Intervention,"Written while the Viet Nam War was still in its early stages, the author attempts to bolster the old Eisenhower-period domino theory, implicating Chinese intervention in every future treaty proposal with Southeast Asian countries. He castigates the poor French to no end. The book is interesting and worthwhile for its historical content up to the period of 1885. The author offers a thorough background on Chinese/French/Vietnamese treaty negotiations during the time France was colonizing Indochina. This work will be of interest to any serious student of the history of Viet Nam, or those interested in Asian history and theimpact of western colonization in the Pacific Rim."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"Recieved the chili clock and spoon redt right now,20-11 at 10;23 a.m. The chili clock is better than I expected! But the chili spoon rest is a torla disappointment!!!! It arrived with the stem broken off and the piece isn""t even in the box any where. I'm like ok now what? Guess I will have to return it or use it broken..don't think so."
4,Moving and Thought-Proviking,"A moving and thought-provoking film that explores the connection between creativity and extreme human stress and deprivation by looking at spontaneous art impulses that arose in the horrific environment of the Nazi concentration camps. Mysticism, symbolism and even quantum physics (Dr. Fred Wolf makes a case for creative transformation at the cellular level) are all used as ways to explain how the human spirit strives to give artistic expression to pain and suffering and how hope persists even in the most brutal and repressive conditions - perhaps even because of those conditions. Not a date movie, but it certainly provides a different take on Holocaust studies."
4,"Very good. On time, not extra fast, but on time scheduled.","I've bought the product to my autistic nephew. He's starting his treatment with melatonin now, we'll see how it goes. The sublingual and flavored is the best on his case, since he's only 5. I'd recommend this one, since for my researches is one of the best prices."
5,Quick Verse,"This is an excellent product, easy to use and almost self expainatory.I purchased 6 or 7 of them all together, one for each of the women in our women's fellowship. This is just a beginners version but for those who want more you can go on line to add on other books and bible versions.For now, for myself I am totally satisfied with the beginners version."
1,Quickverse Essentials 7,Manual leaves a lot to be desired. Websites and contact info no good. Sorry I bought it.
1,QuickVerse Products,"I would highly recommend that no one purchase QuickVerse products, for one reason:They sell you software that requires you to enter an unlocking key code, but if you ever want to reinstall the software, you cannot do it. I tried for weeks to get them to help me at QuickVerse and I could not get the answer. To pour salt onto the wound, I called long distance (their only number for help), and spent more money than their products are worth."
3,Quickverse Essentials Version 7,"This item seemed ok. I have not found it easy to find the process to use it for my purpose, which is daily readings of my choice."
5,A new poet for new generation,"Albert Gibbs seems to be a young poet who can help define his generations search for love, life, and culture. His brief poems are a small glipse into his soul, but don't let the length of the book fool you, every page is more meaningful and deep than the last. I highly recommend this book to anyone who desires to learn more about themselves and is on the same quest young Albert gives us in Observations."
5,Secrets Of Droon,My name is Jake Grass I have read all of the Secrets Of Droon books. The Secrets Of Droon is just like The Magic Tree House but I think The Secrets Of Droon is lots better than the Magic tree house.
5,My review on the secrets of the golden wasp,i think that people who like magic should read this book. the book is about these kids that try to stop lord spar from controlling peoples mines with the golden wasp. it was one of my favorites.
4,Very THICK,"I have this cable running behind the wall up to my lcd tv. They are a bit on the thick side, but very durable and of high quality. I bought this same brand for all the composite cables and the bundle of wires leading to the TV is quite thick."
2,Convenient but Leaky,"I have used this canteen for more than a year now.....however, I can't carry it with the water in it, so basically I'm just slinging a water bowl for my dog over my shoulder when I hike. It would not seal effectively from the day I bought it."
2,Paint chips off quickly,The paint chips away very quickly and you dont have enough of it for a double coat. But my kids love the shapes and I mixed the white and red to make pink so my daughter could have pink dinosaurs for her birthday. Over all it's fun for them and I just think its a bit more expensive than it should be and that you should buy your own modeling paint to go with it.
1,Warning!,"This is NOT the French Toast I was thinking of. This CD is not by the same band who did 'In a Cave' and 'Ingleside Terrace'. I don't mean to bash the band that did produce it, but they are listed under the same artist. So be careful before you buy!"
2,Too dark for me,"This was too strong for me. While appreciating the brilliant writing, I hated the story. It was like a discordant hymn, or festering lilies, or a choking taste served in a crystal chalice. I found it hard to rate and would recommend it only to those readers who can take emotional horror. Montero is a great author but she can be dark and dreadful in her imagined happenings."
1,good reading for the ladies tea club,"Captain of the Sleepers: A NovelKept waiting to ""get hooked"" on the book. Never happened. In all fairness to the author, I either ordered this book by mistake or it was just sent to me by mistake."
1,amateurish tripe,"Simply awful...like it was originally a trilogy and has been compressed into one book at the expense of dialogue, character development, and atmosphere. If you are only reading on an eighth grade level you might find this acceptable. Me? I want my $0.99 back and a swift kick if I ever download anything else by this author."
3,A fun read.,"The book has a good plot but I was hoping for more from the so called ""sorcerers"". I enjoyed the graphic descriptions of what was happening.The story is fun to follow but again, I hoped for a little more. Honestly I would give it 3.5 stars if I could since I do like the work and it is enough that I purchased the second book to ssee how the story ends."
4,A fun and engaging read,"""A prophecy of Swords"" centers around a mercenary named Shadowhelm as he struggles with the mysteries of his birth, and gets caught up (against his better judgment) in an adventure to find a magical sword.This book was easy to read with interesting characters and a world I'd like to learn more about. The story is a lighter fantasy, with the lines between good and evil firmly drawn by the author. Most of the book focuses on Shadowhelm's quest to find the swords mentioned in the title. It's a fun read for days when you just want to curl up with a quilt and let the good guys kick some butt."
1,Unreadable,"I tried getting into this book today, and for me it isn't readable due to the poor paragraph formatting. It just seems like a rushed job with no followup editing.For the small portion I was able to get through the book has the majority of it's paragraphs left justified, but then mixed in are the occasional indented paragraphs. Reading dialogue is especially difficult when there is no indentation since it is difficult to tell when it transitions from one speaker to another, it just doesn't flow the way a novel should."
1,A Prophecy of Swords Utterly Unpolished,"I bought this book accidentally but decided to keep it since it only put me out .99 and I'm a gambler. The money wasn't worth it. Fantasy is supposed to take you to a place where you can forget all of the rules and become absorbed in a place where everything is different. That experience is only successful if the reader isn't pulled out of the author's world by an immature style and ludicrous word balance every couple of sentences. A shame, because the idea wasn't too bad."
1,Holy Stilted Dialog Batman!,"I read mostly fantasy these days, and I'm a pretty forgiving reader. I read for enjoyment and escapism. The last book I read (Robin Hobb's ""Soldier Son"" trilogy) left me wanting a faster pace and more action, so this looked promising.The overall concept and characters are a good start, but it never goes anywhere. No character development, and the dialog is completely flat, it's terrible.As you would expect in a fantasy story there is an entire world of races and geography and cultures that surround the story. Usually these are developed and built, in this case instead of being a tapestry woven around the characters to add color and help understand their motives it end up being literary flotsam that obfuscates the story.Bottom line, save your $0.99 and put it toward anything by Brandon Sanderson, Robert Jordan, Terry Brooks, Terry Goodkind, Robin Hobb (Farseer books), Ken Scholes (Psalms of Isaac series)"
3,Just ok,"The book has a novel concept, although it is often poorly described. There are many characters (throughout this book and the next) that are described as ""sorcerers"" and then never seem to have any special ability what so ever. It is gaps in the storyline and character development like this that make it just an ok read. I often found myself having to re-read aspects of the and try to fill in the gaps myself after realizing that the supplemental information simply wasn't there. The action scenes are short, and the politics of the various ""people"" starts to get confusing in this book, and gets downright annoying in the sequel. For 0.99 its a good purchase, but in this case you will get what you pay for. If you are going to read either book in the series, read this one and pretend it ends here."
3,Longevity,"Pros: subwoofer, and amp.Cons: not for an amatuer, or a pro listener. I'd say beginner.Story: The system is great especially for the cost. But not for continous use. I used the heck out of it for movies, day to day, and music. My speakers finally gave in; however the system/amp itself is strong and continues to push the new speakers I'm using, and the sub is still kicking!"
3,Selective Reader,"I absolutely love Highlander Historical Romance books and have read all of the collections from Hannah Howell, Julie Garwood, Margaret Moore, Julia London, and Donna Fletcher. These are wonderful writers who can make a romance novel so much more than just sexy scenes. They have so much talent that even when the themes sometimes are very similar the actual stories and characters keep you wanting to turn the pages. Julie Garwood's can make me laugh at the most wonderful antics that she incorporates in her novel.Now to get to Melanie George AND ""The Highlander's Stolen Bride"", I can only say that either this is her very first novel or please Ms. George stick to being a CEO of a Personnel Agency, you cannot write. This is one of the most boring books that I have every read, I am so glad that I did not pay much for it. There is no story involved and had totally uninteresting characters which she tries to cover up with sexy scenes on almost every other page. WHERE IS THE STORY!"
5,Loved it!!,"I read this book in a matter of hours. I could not put it down. The sexual tension and emotions were palpable. The sex scenes were steamy, when the h/h finally made love.This book was a breath of fresh air. The heroine was an innocent that wanted to experience sex and goes after the hero full force. In turn, the hero cannot consummate his ""love from afar"" since she is English and he a Scot already betrothed to another.The only part I didn't like was the conflict with her step-brother was resolved way too fast. But, I am not one who reads romance for the mystery and intrigue so this was a 5 star read for me.For an emotionally charged, sensuous read, ""THSB"" is a definite keeper."
2,Adolescent read...just ok,Very quick read that felt more directed to the feeverish teenage audience exploring the coveted romance novel to learn about sensuality. I also found the old English accent of the staff set in the Highlands of Scotland to be out of place and cumbersome to sit through.
2,What is the hype about?,"I actually somehow managed to get through half of this book before putting it down. Contrary to sexual tension or emotion, I found the book boring and predictable with very little character development. I could've cared less what happened to the main characters because they were so lifeless and dull. They fall into bed almost immediately and then someone keeps hitting the hero over the head and trying to kill him. Oh, who could it be? Of course, every 'conflict' is tidily resolved and there are some sex scenes with the requisite 'dirty' words. Save your money."
5,Power galore...,"Without taking up a lot of space - let me get right to the point. Out of the box 3 1/2 inch nails driven into a stack of (two) pressure treated 2x4's like butter, even countersunk.Lightwieght, considering the competition 7.8lbs. This is one powerful gun. Packs a big kick (something to get used to). Plus I got a free palm nailer with my purchase and that's a handy little tool. You'd be hard pressed to find a better Pnuematic nailer and the price is right..."
5,It works like a John Deere . Right up there with SnapOn.,"I just received the framing tool today. Just tried it a few times works perfect I'm going to ""road test"" this weekend. I'll let you know. Plenty of power for 3 1/2"" nails."
1,"Palm Nailer included "" truth or Lie""","From other reviews on this site, it seems that sometimes you get the bonus Palm nailer, sometimes you dont. I also did not get mine and also could have gotten the same deal from Lowes locally but now have missed this opportunity. Amazon.com is going to lose my business 4-ever if this is not corrected."
2,MRLEVEL builder and remodeler,I recently purchased the N88WW to replace my old 20 year old bostitch framing gun and was very disapointed with the way it operates I could not sink 16d nails into the LVL's that we were using and had the pressure on the compressor at 110 lbs. I tried toe nailing some studs with 8d nails and had the same problem. I then took out my old nailer and had no problems with it sinking the nails into the LVL's and other lumber. I think they miss labeled this gun high power.I returned the gun and decided to tune up the old one and continue to use it. Eventuly I will buy a framing gun but not a new bostitch.
2,"Interesting, but no ""My Soul to Keep""","Let me say that I read ""My Soul to Keep"" first and found it to be an excellent, couldn't put down, book! So, I expected the same in ""The Between"". What I found was a good book with interesting twists and turns, never really understanding or figuring out what was going on... however, can't put it down, because you're hoping that the next page or chapter will reveal the answer to your questions...This didn't happen.. although I did enjoy reading ""The Between"", I was very disappointed by the ending. The last page is a big question mark for me. What happened? I still don't know. I am confused and if anyone can help me out with the last page, I'd appreciate it greatly. I'm waiting on another novel by Ms. Due... hopefully more along the lines of ""My Soul to Keep""..."
3,My Soul to Keep is her best work,"I read ""MY Soul to Keep"" first even though it was her second novel. Ms. Due is ""Mad"" talented with true literary skills. That can't be taken from her, but I didn't like this book as much it left me feeling a little empty."
3,It had its moments,"I read Ms. Due's first book ""My Soul to Keep"" and was completely swept away. I suppose I ""expected"" the same dazzle this for the ""Between"". But, its never as good as the first time. It had some interesting parts, but I quickly grew tired of watching this man's life unravel. I also dreaded the entire dream sequence. Lastly, I didn't really get it."
4,MORE MORE MORE,wish she could push books out as fast as j. patterson....love her writing. Loved the Blood Colony series most of all.
5,Chilling!,"I already knew when I started to read this book that it was going to be 1) well written and 2) scary because Ms. Due had done it again (I had already read My Soul To Keep), and I was right on both counts. I considered this a page-turner & a definate must-read. A chill went up my spine when I got to the end. I knew something was going to have to happen, but just wasn't sure what."
4,The Future is Bright for Ms. Due,"Ms. Due definately has a career ahead of her as a best selling novelist. If works like this are any indication, Science Fiction will be taken to an entirely new level. I'm not normally a fan of the Genre but I can't wait to read anything Ms. Due writes.This book keeps your interest from page 1. Makes you afraid to fall asleep at night, and sticks with you for a long time. I suggest you get a Tananarive Due shelf in your library and fill it up with everything she writes."
3,Brazil's answer to the Hollies!,"The Golden Boys were one of Brazil's best bands from the ""jovem guarda"" teenybopper rock scene. They did tons of cover tunes like everybody else, but they usually had more skill at it than most, and have some really fun material, such as their cover of the Hollies ""Bus Stop"", and the usual assortment of Beatles tunes. This is a nice 2-CD set, and one of the better releases in the ""Bis"" series."
1,Cheap,"This stool was purchased to use outdoors with astronomy equipment. However, one of the metal legs broke before it was ever used outdoors. The legs were made of very cheap metal. I was so disgusted that the stool was thrown in the garbage rather than go through a frustrating process of sending it back and asking for a refund."
1,drummers/shooters stool,Cheap is as cheap does. One of the potmetal cast lugs the leg extension arms attaches do broke off while I was sitting on it and it dumped me on my back which when your not expecting it is quite an event with a gun in you hands. Once again I've proved to myself you get what you pay for. I would not recomend this product to anyone.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,SEAT IS HARD AS ROCK AND CHEAPLY FABRICATED --CAST IRON CASING FOR TUBING WAS CRACKED AND SEAT WAS WOBBLY NO MATTER WHAT YOU TRIED TO DO -- CHEAP IS AS CHEAP DOES--CHEAP-- SOLD IT AT A RESALE SHOP FOR CLOSE TO BREAKEVEN-- GET THE REAL THING SPEND THE $
2,Not correct.,The part I ordered was for my year make and model. But upon intallation the part was not 100% correct. The freon lines were on the diagonal side as the original and the wire harness was on the inside not the outside like the original. My technician was able to make it work but it was not a direct replacement.Furthermore the compressor makes a ticking sound for the first 10-20 mins when first started like it has something wrong with it.I do not recommend this part to anyone. It is a gambel how long it will last.Overall I am disappointed. I've spent just as much money on the installation and freon as the compressor. Just to find out it's probably no even the right part.
5,A great teaching tool!,"This is perfect, not big and bulky like most flannel boards. It folds up nice to put away neatly and takes little space. I did a story with my son and he loved it. The possibilities are endless with teaching a toddler, or more."
1,flannel board,"easy to install but the felt letters and animals that my grand daughter plays with don't stick very well. They work fine with the two portable boards she has, gonna it it a few days and then I might return the item."
3,The Black Mike Saga continues,"The story has a good pace to it and I enjoyed the way it was told chronologically while also alternating locations within each chapter. My only problem with the book was the spelling errors and the formatting. I read the same passage on four different pages. Despite the errors, I still enjoyed the book."
5,Old Friends Reuniting,"This is another book in the Mike Black Saga. This book talks about Nick Simmons from the time he left Black and the crew, whats he been up to, how he got into some trouble, and ended up back with the old neighborhood crew. This is a 5 star book that closes some loose ends, and opens up some new ones. That talks about some old friends and introduces some new friends as well.Here is the E-book order on Mike Black;The Mike Black Saga; Book OneThe Mike Black Saga; MOBPrivate DeceptionsThe Mike Black Saga; Payback (February 2012)The Mike Black Saga; Outlaw,The Mike Black Saga; In A Cold Sweat, (March 2012)All About The MoneyThe Mike Black Saga; No More Tears in the End.Bury Me DeepCommit To ViolenceAn Urban DramaThe Cost of VengeanceBeneath The SurfaceOut of ControlSecrets of WarA Tale of Three Woman (No date set)My other books are Killing Them Softly; An Erotic Tale of MurderThe Playa ChroniclesGoing Down; An Erotic Tale of Murder"
3,most of this book was sort of boring,"I'll give you a piece of my advice, don't let the poodle turn into a vampire, that leads to the reeaally boring part, I'm still trying to find a happy ending to that part. Instead turn into the vampire yourself... And if you make the right choices you can go to the really exciting part..... Take chances and this book'll go exciting, don't.... and it'll go boring. Exciting or boring.... You decide!"
4,Please Don't Feed the Vampire,"Some parts of this book was a little bit boring. But overall it was good. Please Don't Feed the Vampire is mainly about you screaming over yourself because you bought Vampire in a Can, the dumbest Halloween costume in the world. You decide to throw away thr useless can when you discover something weird. DANGER, it says on the packet-You wonder why. Do you even think about opening the packet or should you just leave it alone. Whichever decision you make will greatly affect your adventure and things out of this world make come to bite you!Thank You Very Much! Your Time is Appreciated!"
3,THIS BOOK WAS GOOD AND EXCITING,"hERE'S SOME ADVICE: IF YOU WANT TO BE SCARED, TURN THE POODLEINTO A VAMPIRE! iF YOU TURN YOURSELF INTO A VAMPIRE, CHANCES AREYOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT MUCH INTEREST IN THE BOOK FOR VERY LONG. bUT THE CHOICE IS YOURS! rEMEMBER, IF YOU TURN THAT POODLE INTO A VAMPIRE THAT LEADS TO AWSOMENESS!"
1,Low Quality - Limited Application,"I just needed something with built in speakers to use as a training aid for piano lessons. For anyone else, don't even bother. The quality is poor...the player skips all over the place at the slightest vibration...the sound is poor. It's suiting my very limited need, but please look to another player for your own purchase."
1,complaint,"I already had purchased a Coby CD player from you and like it. So, I ordered another one for my wife. It arrived and on arrival it made a noise rather than operating....and never did work from day one. So.... I sent it back immediately to Amazon Customer Service. Naturally......I received no response and doubt that I ever will get one.I never will order any electronic device directly from Amazon.Very dissapointed customer. I buy often on Amazon.PAUL GAUDETTE"
4,TERRIFIC !,Would like to talk with Denton on the subject. Interested in the subject. Is there a way to contact her?
5,Good Read,"The transaction was smooth with no problems. The book was in great condition with one exception. Pages 79 thru 110 in the book had been inserted upside-down, which was a little disconcerting when reading it. Certainly not the fault of the seller....doubt that they would have ever noticed unless they read that particular copy of the book cover to cover. But, a good read and an interesting look into the the politics and crime (kind of the same thing actually) in Kentucky. I am a big ""Justified"" fan, so this was some interesting background."
4,Interesting read,"Did not realize there was soooo much corpuption in KY. Made for an interesting history lesson. At times it was a bit tedious reading, a lot of documentary stuff, which made it somewhat boring as well. But if it is the kind of story line you like it is worth reading."
2,Two stars for digging up fact,"I guess the fact that every page of my copy was written in boldface should have been a tipoff. This book is painful reading, and not because it uncovers corruption in my home town. The string of misused adjectives (""The muggy air hung in abeyance for days on end during the 1979 heat wave..""C'mon--I think she can afford a dictionary!), cliches, and unedited typos makes a page of this book difficult to read through. Unfortunately, that's not because of the complexity of the material. This woman has done some research (although she seems not to know what makes a person a ""blueblood"" in Kentucky). I believe she's done research for Jack Anderson. I can see why she was a researcher and not a writer."
4,Bluegrass Conspiracy,"In a southern rural region,a town of culture and money finds corruption in its midst. The police,the politicians and local bluebloods are involved in drugs and murder. A true story that is still talkled about in Lexington, KY. Interesting reading."
3,The day we left town,"If this were an all instrumental album, it would be nearly a 5 star disc. The downtempo/IDM beats are superb... but then he sings R&B over top of it!??? His voice sounds a bit like Sade, which is an amazing voice, but it does not go with this music very well (in my opinion, of course). I guess I was just disappointed because of all the glowing reviews, but I can only listen to the couple intrumentals on this cd. It's frustrating because I can hear a fantastic album that is sadly drowned by the vocals. If Sade-esqu R&B vocals over glitchy downtempo IDM sounds great to you, then this is your record."
3,Works but I needed to modify,Got this item for a 07 dodge 3500 .. Plugged it up and didn't want to work .. I started to think that the bazooka internel amp was burnt .. I did some checking and was getting power to the bazooka amp But no power on the remote .. I had to wire it to theKey Lighter outlet soIt would turn on when key was in the on position.. So Where the pin in for the remote was supposeto be there was nothing on the other Side to power it up.. But it works now ..
4,Knowledge IS capital...,"...and Business Technologist Peter Fingar understand this. Fingar has a strong grasp of the revolutionary times that we live in. Comparing the Internet with Gutenberg's printing press, Extreme Competition allows readers to tap into Mr. Fingar's 30+ years of work at the intersection of business and technology.Fingar's focus on cyber companies like eBay, Google, Lulu and Skype, as well as his understanding of today's ""Extreme Individuals"" provides important nuggets of information for everyone interested in the global economy."
3,Stainless Steel 8-Quart Stockpot,"I was disappointed only because I ordered this item specifically for the purpose of using my electric mixer in it; however, the directions specify NOT to use this appliance in it. The material is not as heavy as I expected that it would be."
3,it works with induction but it is very light weight,"It's not the best quality ... not sure how well it will handle being banged around in my cupboard. There is a metal disc on the bottom of the pan which makes it induction compatible ... seems to work ok. I don't use a pot of this size often, so it's probably sufficient for me, but I'd recommend looking for better quality to someone who needs something like this for every day use."
2,Great but disposable after 2 years,"The glass kettle works fine and is very goodlooking, BUT it cannot be repaired (manufacturer's rules, according to the Toastess representative) so when there is a flaw that shows up after two years you are out of luck.We used the kettle over part of two years (seasonally, because it was kept in a summer cottage) and used it only to boil water, so we were quite surprised when the kettle suddenly stopped working. A repairman found that the switch was burned out and blackened, and suggested that it would be simple to replace the switch if we obtained one from the manufacturer. After calling Customer Service, we were told that they could not supply a switch, that the kettles could not be repaired, and that your only option after two years was to replace the unit. The moral I have gathered from this is never to buy an appliance that becomes disposable if something happens -- or a defect is revealed -- after the warranty period. What a waste!"
4,This is the only one!,"This is the only kettle my husband will use to make Ice Tea. I ordered another from Proctor Silex, but it was plastic and he would not even look at it. The glass pot is what he likes the most. He can see if it is clean. I got the first 2 pots 3 years ago, one for work and one for home and he is now working on the next two pots. He makes Iced tea 2-3 times a day, every day,so I think they work great. They are a bit pricey and hard to find, but if he is happy...so am I!!"
5,So pretty!,"I love my new Globe Kettle, it looks terrific in the kitchen and water boils very fast. I am an instant coffee drinker and use this kettle a lot.Thanks for a great product!"
5,Great Product,"This kettle performs exactly as described, it starts to boil immediately and then cuts itself off. No more letting all the water burn out and buring up the kettle. It also looks great on the counter. I can't believe how much electricity I have wasted on heating up the electric range for one pot of boiling water, didn't want to use the micorwave, it's just not the same. I thought I might miss the sound of the whistle of the kettle, but before you can walk away it's already boiling."
2,Beautiful but a fire hazard,"I love this kettle because of its great looks and quick performance. However, the electrical connections loosened over time and burned out. I replaced them in a series of 'surgeries' replacing one connection after another. I became an expert in taking the silly thing apart. If I was wiser I would have replaced all the connections in the first place!"
4,Toastess water boiler,"I found this kettle to be well built. The wide base helps avoiding tipping when the kettle is set down off its base. The glass bowl gives you confidence that the water is clean! Be aware this kettle isn't 100% glass - the heating base (bottom of bowl) appears to be stainless steel. (In the last similar appliance I had, the heating element was a loop in the water hidden from view. Although that appliance heated faster, when it failed, I opened it and was disgusting to see the crud that had accumulated on the heating element.) There are two small disadvantages to the Toastess design - 1) it gets quite noisy when the water approaches boiling due to the heating bottom acting as a sounding board (then it gets much quieter as boiling begins) and 2) the glass bowl is somewhat heavier than an equivalent plastic kettle. But the big advantage is - you can S*E*E that the contents are clean."
1,Frustrating!,"This is a lovely kettle that worked well with once a month use for several months. When the kettle was used on a daily basis, something went bad and the thermostat began shorting out. I contacted the manufacturer since the kettle was still under the 1 year warrenty, but I since I did not have the original purchase info (my bad) they said they couldn't help me. I had documentation on the box of the maufacture date, but Toastess said that was not adequate. I am sadly out $60 and the use of what I thought was a fine kettle."
4,"Clean, clear GLASS","This kettle looks so beautiful in my kitchen! It's also a hard working, no nonsense water boiler -- the water does boil, not just heat up -- bubbles and gurgles before it automatically shuts off. It's very quick, a little noisy, but not annoying. And NO PLASTIC ODOR. I wish it were less expensive, but I don't regret spending the money. A fine purchase."
2,Looks nice but didn't last!,Kettle very stylish in design but unfortunately glass cracked within one week's use.
2,more like a demon that accomplished what he set out to do,"How could this Bhagwan be ""wise"" when he was literally *killing* people???? Unfortunately, the book does not give much insight into how ""normal"" people get sucked into this kind of horror. And it would be nice if it also *named names* so we could know who the people were who cooperated with the Bhagwan's terrorist activities - there are probably many who are still at large ..."
4,Good Stuff,"This CD is actually better than I thought. A lot of live recordings are all distorted and it is difficult to hear the music. But this was recorded very well. A few songs like The Beautiful People and Anti-christ Superstar are a little distorted from their album recordings, but that is expected on a live album. But songs like Sweet Dreams and Last Day on Earth are actually recorded quite nicely. This album could almost be considered a compilation of greatest hits. It has all the classic songs as well as a couple not on any of Manson's albums."
4,Something's Missing,"Of course, a live album cannot convey the entire experience that is a live Manson show. The quality of the sound of the album is fair to good. Maybe I've just been playing it louder than my car stereo can handle. Listening to the album brought back memories of all the times I've seen the band, but it obviously cannot replace a show. If you've never seen them live, the album probably won't be as enjoyable as you cannot correlate the visual experience with the sound. But I guess it is better than never hearing them live at all. All that being said, it is still Marilyn and it's great. I can't personally give it five stars without ""Speed of Pain"" or ""Coma White"". Thank Satan for their refusal to leave out ""The Reflecting God""."
5,Marilyn Manson rocks!,"This cd truly shows how awsome Marilyn Manson really is. For those of you who never seen Marilyn Manson live, this cd is a must have. With this cd, you will be able to experience the rush of a live Manson show. Also the cd has a brand new song on it. The song demonstrates John5's awsome guitar skills. The guitar riffs in that song rock (unlike the sorry riffs that Zim Zum did on the ACS). If you dont like Manson well then just.......go listen to hanson or backstreet boys and keep your mouth shut because whatever you say is ignorant."
4,Marilyn Manson LIVE!!!,"This is my 6th Marilyn Manson CD! These are some awesome compilations of Manson's live performances! I thought most of the songs were pretty good! I loved the live version of Sweet Dreams (Are Made of These) If you are a goth and love Marilyn's music, you'll love THE LAST TOUR ON EARTH!!!"
4,Awesome Live compilation,"I haven't heard this album in a few years. A friend bought the box set that has this CD and a live VHS tape with it. When you hear the opener to this album you will feel like your right there in the front row of a Manson concert. Brian put on a good show back then. I don't know how good he is now, but buying this will be worth it. I recommend getting the box set If you can still find it. I'm sure it's out of print now but if not just get the live CD release."
4,"This is one ""Dope Show"".","Like many live albums do, this also serves as a ""Greatest Hits"" in a way. Sure it's missing some of his best stuff, but the popular songs are here. Besides numerous songs from ""Antichrist Superstar"" and ""Mechanical Animals"", it also includes a studio track, a soundtrack song, and the cover of ""Sweet Dreams (are made of this)"". The actual performance here is pretty good, with some preaching from the man himself, but not too much. I'm not sure if this is my favorite release of his, but if you've seen him in concert, or wanted to, this is an absolute must."
2,Poor sound quality,"The sound quality and production on this recording is mediocre. The live tracks on ""Remix & Repent"" and the B sides on ""The Dope Show"" are much better ."
5,fantastic,"i'm not even a fan of marilyn manson, but this cd really struck a chord in me. great live versions of the hits i've heard like, ""the dope show,"" and, ""the beautiful people,"" rock hard, and he shows that he can perform with spare arrangements as well in the lovely, ""the last day on earth."" they are a very talented band"
4,THIS IS TRUELY MANSON AT HIS BEST,"Lets start by saying Manson is back to his old self after his trendy ""Mechanical Animals"" cd.This cd definately is manson at his all...in the way he is suppose to be heard,LIVE.Its more like a greatest hits album though then a new cd...done in the same style as pantera's 101 proof.But still if you are a manson fan this is DEFINATELY the cd to get."
5,"The Last Tour on Earth, and a good one at that","This album is a tour de force of Manson's most electrifying part of his art - his live performances. The music is played brilliantly, and he delivers incredible vocals. The CD has many different songs on it, from older albums to his newest song, ""Astonishing Panorama of the End Times,"" an excellent track. The extreme heaviness of ""The Reflecting God"" is reason alone to buy this one. Every song is done perfectly, and Manson is in top form throughout the album. Sadly, most will miss out due to the stigma attached to Manson, and that is too bad. Manson's live album is brilliant, and deserves to be in everyone's library. Even if you don't like his music, you have to respect his ability to fully arouse every sense in your body and give you what you don't want to hear. I can't say enough good things about this album."
5,Amazing,"This is simply one of the best live albums ever. And to the reviewer who said Manson ""is an idiot"", why don't you learn how to spell before you call anyone an idiot."
4,Sound is a little scratchy at points but okay,I am a huge fan of live albums because I am not really aloud to go to a concert because my parents are christien and don't like the idea of their son going to a concert of someone so evil but I plan on going to a concert after I move out. I own every single movie by Marilyn and I love the sound on those but unfortunately this album isn't as good. Still it is worth your money since Manson is awesome Live and this was one of his best tours ever.
3,"Sweet Dreams was good, but was not recoreded properly","I bought this cd for the ""Sweet Dreams"" song that was featured on House on Haunted Hill. The recording in the movie was good, but on the cd they went cheap. The recorded it in a live concert. You could hear the people in the background and the person who sang it did not do a good job this time. I would look for another version."
2,An alright album,"You have to admit, that no matter how much you like Marylin Mansons music, that he is an idiot. This album is not very good and I reccomend you get mechacial animals instead."
3,"Axion ACN-5507 5"" TV","Compact, clear image, pleasing design. Drawback: channel reverts to 2 every time it's turned off."
3,Nice but iffy,"Nice little battery operated color TV...but, I can find only one channel... and had a very difficult time findiing a radion station. And, this was in perfect weather... not confident in a bad weather situation."
3,For Hurricane emergency.,"It is limited only by the inability to receive any other channel except Channel 6, which is NBC. I tried an external antenna, with even worse results. The test will come when a real hurricane comes and we have to rely on it. The jury is out until then. But the little unit is cute and I don't regret buying it."
2,Not Worth It!,"This TV has exceptionally poor color. There are not any adjustment knobs to increase color and correct tint. All you can adjust is brightness.The color is washed out looking and flesh tones look yellowish to green.Although this TV has a jazzy style and comes with electric and car adapters, the quality of the picture simply isn't acceptable."
2,Poor reception,I had high hopes for this little TV after reading all the great reviews. The reception is horrible even though my old and very cheap b/w TV works great in the same location.
2,Action ACN-5507,"I received this TV about an hour ago unpacked it and hooked it up. The picture was OK for what I needed it for as a matter of fact it is a good picture. I am using it as a monitor for a surveillance camera at the gate to the house.As I watch it I noticed that the company name was up-side-down and that the tuning bar was too. but, the LCD was right-side-up in the cabinet. The quality control guy must have been zonked.[...]Mike"
1,Glare control,This is a nice unit except it needs a shroud to keep some glare away from the screen so that you can see while using it outside.
1,DID NOT GET A CHANCE TO USE,THE ITEM WAS RECEIVED IN GOOD TIME BUT IT WAS DEFECTIVE. THE AUDIO VIDEO INPUTS WERE BEAUTIFUL OFF MY VCR AND DVD BUT THE TUNER WOULD NOT TUNE ANY LOW VHF CHANNELS. I HAVE TWO OTHER HANDHELDS AND BOTH WORK FINE ON VHF AND UHF BUT SIDE BY SIDE THIS WOULD NOT TUNE VHF. I RETURNED IT AND WAS TOLD COULD NOT GET A REPLACEMENT AS IT WAS NO LONGER AVAILABLE FROM THE SUPPLIER SO AM AWAITING MY REFUND !!!
1,Don't buy from Amazon.com,"I bought this from Amazon.com and got a USED/RETURNED unit. There were scrteched all over the screen and everything showed signs of used and wear. returned it the next day and guess what? THEY CHARGED ME FOR SHIPPING.About the TV, the reception was okey. You need to walk around to find a spot for the best receptions.BOTTOM LINE, DON'T BUY THIS FROM AMAZON.COM!"
3,"Not bad, but I need help hooking up gaming consoles.",It's an okay TV. But I am having trouble hooking up game consoles such as the PS One and Xbox. I cannot figure out how to connect an RF adapter between my gaming consoles and this TV. Any technical advice will be much appreciated.
2,Axion portable tv ACN-5507 5,"Very poor picture.We have a lot of power outages in Avon Park.WE are not close to stations.70 miles to Tampa.We do pick up a few,so it suits the purpose."
3,Shipping cost that I had absorbed,"On a previous purchase I was totaly missled, I purchased a 9"" tv and it said a/c d/c and I took for granted it was for average batteries not a car battery. Your page did not explain what kind of battery's to use so I ordered the set. When I received it I saw that it was not what I wanted so I shipped it back. I feel that was not my fault and I should not have paid return shipping charges."
3,"Very cool TV, but only 24 channels.","The TV is very compact, attractive and able to be connected to many peripheral devices. It can also be used in a car. If you're buying it to attach to a Playstation or other game, you will probably be quite pleased. The screen quality is good as is the reception. The flaw is that, although you can hook it to cable, you can only get channels up to 24. For that reason, we returned ours, since we wanted it to see some higher channels."
1,Don't Buy this Product,"I paid $134 for a battery tv that doesn't work with batteries. After only 2 short uses of about 10 minutes each, the battery pack stopped working. The tv works if I plug it into an electrical outlet, but since I bought it to use when we have a power failure, it's worthless to me. The batteries are good, but the tv doesn't work when I plug in the battery pack."
1,unremarkable tv,"I have been looking for a wireless tv forever due to frequent power outages where we live. I had high hopes for this one based on reviews. You cannot put it on the channel you want, it operates on its own, scanning until it hits on a station which is very frustrating. the battery compartment falls off and operates very poorly on battery. It has minimal reception and picture when it is plugged into an outlet.I would never order another product from this company and am returning the tv."
1,Not works at all,"I bought this TV last month $75 and I lived in Los Angeles CA.(NOT suburbs area) when I turn it on, NONE of any channel appeared on the screen, even channels 2-13. Due to bad connection I only heard static voices and the bar go up and down to try to pick the signal but never successful . I received it and return the same day. I did not get any signal at all, so I tried Tivax Scout3.5"" TV it works so good and I got so many channels UHF but VHF only channels 2,4,5,13 (No 7,9) I am so happy with that, at least something better than nothing."
2,They forgot the cable connection,"The product seems fine, but on careful inspection I was surprised to find that there was no way to take a signal off of cable."
5,"5""LCD TV","We are happy with this size for the kitchen counter,is compact does not take up too much room,has a good picture,it would been nice if it had a remote.James Starling Sterling Hts, Mi"
1,What a disappointment!,"I absolutely love Higgins' books and could never put them down. I signed up with our local library, months before Day of Reckoning was to be released, so that I could be one of the first to read this book. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment. I kept giving it another 50 pages to get better but that never really happened. The characters were just shells, the dialogue was downright boring, and the situations were contrived and lacked any spark. I hope Mr. Higgins will redeem himself in his next writing!"
4,Sean Dillon is back...,Sean Dillon is back and this time he is helping Blake Johnson avenge the murder of his wife. It is a good read but it is not up to Jack Higgins' usual best.I read all of Jack Higgins' books and anxiously await each book. I especially love the Sean Dillon series.. This was good but I was hoping for more development of the characters. Disappointed that there is not alot of Hannah Bernstein in the book.but all in all it is still a good read..
2,Short and disappointing,"I have been a Jack Higgins fan for quite a number of years. Unfortunately, I found his latest effort to be sadly lacking. The novel has exceedingly wide margins and is double-spaced. It is a very quick read and has practically no character development. There is also a dearth of any real descriptive writing. Overall, the book reminded me of a quick draft of the dialogue for a screenplay."
2,day of reckoning,The day of reckoning started off very nicely. A good mafia book always gets my interest but after the first 25 pages all the characters in the book did was talk about how they loved their work in the secret police in England and eat. I will say it was an easy read but very very predicable.
2,Not the best,"I didn't enjoy this book very much. There's a large number of characters in the book. These characters seem very underdevelopped and it can be hard at times to remember who everyone is. Plus, at least to me, the whole plot and series of events seemed rather predictable and not overly exciting. It just seemed like the ""good guys"" did too much damage before the ""bad guys"" even realized what was going on and decided to retaliate."
2,Day of Reckoning . A nightmare of narration,"The story is predictable Higgins. A depressingly bland regurgitation of old worn out plots and characters. This, however, is not the real problem. Whatever residual entertainment left behind in these tapes is strangled by Mr MacNee's astonishingly bad narration. He has never been a good reader and has detracted varying amounts from other novels. This attempt is quite awful. The accents are insulting and the tempo agonizing. This is one of the very few audio publications that I have been genuinely unable to finish. While I doubt I will ever pick up another Higgins effort I can say with absolute certainty that I will never buy another MacNee narration."
2,A Lunch-time thriller,"You can read this latest Jack Higgins book in the average lunch hour - formula characters, formula killings, and formula ending. My advice? Re-read ""The Eagle has Landed""."
2,This was disgusting,Normaly i like Jack Higgins but this was terrible. The characters were under developed and the plot was unbelivalbely far fetched and completely nonsensical
1,Day of Reckoning,"In this writing Higgins seems to have run out of new ideas to keep the reader interested and involved. He presents us with a mish mash of unrelated characters that appear to be falling over each other and getting nowhere. I wondered what purpose some of them served for the story line.Every once in a while an author will experience a period when he will dry up and be at a loss for a plot, and even words, but eventually he rescues himself at a later date with a plot line that one finds intriguing and captivating. Hopefully Higgins will find his way out of his doldrum and return to the insightful prolific writer we know. Take your time, Jack, it'll come back to you'E.J. Walden, author of ""Operation Snow Owl""S"
1,The worst Higgins book I've ever read.,"Terrible. I'm embarassed and ashamed that I read the whole thing; I thought of putting it down often, and should have. Save yourself. Cartoonish, hurried, formulaic, embarassing."
3,"A good read, but short","Jack Higgin's latest book is a good read, but very short, taking at most 5 hours to complete. Sean Dillon's fearsome reputation is alluded to often, but rarely seen. The book contains 273 pages. But there are 3 blank pages between each chapter, of which there are 16. 16 x 3 = 48. 273 - 48 = 225 pages of reading material. Each page only has 28 lines; most novels have 40, or more. Each line has an average of 11 words; most novels have 13. So what we end up with is about 135 pages of regular novel sized pages, which in reality makes this a short story (but costs the same as a regular novel). Mr. Higgins' prevous novel was also very short. Perhaps he is running out of material? Or adjectives? Since he has written a lot of novels over the years, perhaps Mr. Higgins should think of retiring. His stories are beginning to show his tiredness."
1,Horrible,"I grew up loving Jack Higgins thanks to The Eagle has Landed and Storm Warning. A few years back, I picked up his latest and promised myself, my days of reading new offerings from Mr. Higgins were over. I forgot that promise to myself and picked up this one. I renew my pledge to cease reading Mr. Higgins new offerings."
2,Not worth the day..,"It takes to read this sophmoric novel. Cliche'd, predictable, abrubt, summarized. Reads like cliff notes. Worst Higgins novel I've read. Please take your time with the next book Mr. Higgins"
1,I felt like I was reading a Hardy Boys book,"From the 'Eagle has Landed' Jack has sunk to a new low. I accepted long ago that someone in each Higgins book always has ""a Mauser with a bulbous silencer buried deep in their trenchcoat pocket"" - but this book is far too shallow. I was surprised that none of the other reviewers mentioned that the NY characters in this book spoke using British phrases - very amateurish. Like other reviewers, I've sworn off him before - I'll try harder this time!"
1,This is bad; really bad,"I have not picked up such a juvenile book in ages. With several successful books under his belt and banking on his name alone, Jack Higgins has resorted to turning them out fast and simple. The characters and dialogue are as shallow as a mud puddle and just about as dry. Reads like it was dictated in the barber's chair."
1,Weak...Limp....Empty.....,"I thought this might be an interesting read, but boy was I wrong. This book reads like a bad condensed version, and that's being kind. The story unfolds at a break-neck pace, almost too fast. No thought is put into character or plot development. The characters are boring, and predictable. Honestly, I couldn't finish this book. I read the 1st 100 pages and couldn't connect with any of it. It seems like not too much effort was put into this."
2,"Too many characters, not enough characterization","There are more than 75 -- count 'em, 75 -- characters with speaking parts in this book. The author spends most of his time moving them from place to place. And the characters are hard to tell apart because they're all made of oak or maybe hard maple. Some of the action is okay, but that can't make up for the wooden people."
2,Same Old Same Old,"The Jack Higgins for the new millenium is identical to the Jack Higgins of the old. Clear cut heroes and villains. A tale of delicious revenge, exacted by a group of superheroes. But oh, how boring, how incredibly predictable this tired plotline is. Go read some earlier Higgins, or grab some other, newer author's action thriller off the shelf. This one is all washed up."
1,Boring,I can't belive that a grown man has written this. It's stupid and the caracters are thin and boring. This is the nearest I have come to ask my money back for a book. It's just typewriting. And I'm a thriller fan and I have enjoyd Mr Higgins books before. But this...
1,Don't read this book,"Not even same, same. Clearly Higgins and publishers have resorted to churning out mediocrity written by school children for pocket money under the brand name of Higgins. Obviously the best work is now behind us and like so many authors who have established themselves and then cease to respect the readers who established them (Clancy, James Patterson, John Grisham et al) we get insulted by teams of nobodies trying to write a book under a known name using stale ingredients mixed together in a drunken stupor. That's the last Higgins I read."
1,Day of Reckoning,"This was the worst Jack Higgins book that I have evey read. The Sean Dillon storyline is ripe and needs to be retired. Dillon, the charming Irish rogue,is now just a pale immitation of the early books. By the way, how many times can Hannah express her disagreement with Dillon's tactics, but remain with Ferguson's team? How many times can she look at Dillon lovingly, but realize that his past is too much to overcome? How many times can she say, ""Damm you Dillon?"" What a ""remarkable woman."" Also, why all the profanity? In a 295 page book, is it necessary to use over 40 different versions of the ""F word?"" Higgins did not use such langugae in his early works. I found it very distracting. Since this is my last Higgins novel, I will just have to reread The Eagle has Landed."
3,Fast paced action,"Like most of Higgins' novels, the story spans a short time period. With the characters moving between many settings, the individual settings tend to be treated somewhat superficially. Also, some parts of the plot seem a bit clumsy. The story brings back Sean Dillon, Bridadier Ferguson, and others, this time dealing with the Mafia. Overall, it is an interesting story as the good guys move about disrupting the plans and businesses of the bad guys. Both sides make use of their in-house computer hackers, and the good guys don't always stay within the law."
2,Disappointing read,"It could have been an exciting and suspenseful book but the dialogue was so contrived, the action so predictable, and there was such a total lack of descriptive narrative that it was boring. Ho hum, and we all knew the heroes would survive! Sorry Mr. Higgins, this one isn't up to your usual par."
2,Flat Formula,"No doubt, the ingredients of a great thriller exist in Day of Reckoning. The villains are evil, the locations are exotic and the heroes are gallant. Unfortunately, all of these assets are thin and flat. The villains are dunces, unable to appreciate or even emotionally react to threats and disasters. The heroes are cool, almost bored. While revenge for a brutal murder is at stake, no real danger threaten them. It's a sleepwalk to the final page.Please understand, I am a big Higgins fan that found the Dillon/Blake partnership to be entertaining in The President's Daughter and The Whitehouse Connection. As a paperback, Day of Recknoning offers some value. I trust Jack Higgins can boost the emotion around a successful formula in future yarns."
2,Higgins Losing His Touch!,"I have never missed a Jack Higgins novel. But the last couple of his books have been extremely monotonous reads. Same characters, same predictable conversations. I know I am not going to be reading his latest books more than once. But these books may still provide for exciting reading to those who are not used to his work. I hope he can come up with a better book next time around (and with different characters)."
1,Wish I could give it Zero Stars,"This could be the worst book I've read. Jack Higgins surely did not write this book. The author did not develop any character, location or situation. The story was lame, the dialog short and clipped and there was no attention to detail ( a 25 millimeter pistol, give me a break!). You can't expect Clancy type technical detail from everyone - but let's do SOME research. Do not waste your money on this one. It would be money ill spent. If you are a Higgins fan and feel you must read this, get it from the library."
1,Unbelievable Trite,"It's been several years since I read a Higgins book and it will be several more before I pick up another. The hero's actions are unrealistic, the gadgets fake, (a Howler, give me a break) and the dialog childish. I found myself rooting for the villians."
1,Tired Formula,"Unlike some authors, such as Tom Clancy, who bring back the same characters in book after book, Higgins seems to be just going through the motions with his latest offering. Dillon & Co. hopscotch from one adventure to another in an unbelievable plot to avenge the death of Blake Johnson's former wife. At only 295 double spaced pages, Higgins seems to have milked these characters of all they have to offer and his loyal readers for another easy payday. Shame on Higgins."
1,Day Of Reckoning,"Not only is this the worst book I have ever read by Jack Higgins, it is the worst book I have read in recent memory. For such an accomplished author to pen such a terrible unrealistic story must be only for the money he receives from the publisher. Not only is the plot unrealistic, the story moves so fast the characters never get a chance to develop. The main character soon takes a secondary role and soon after all but disappears from the story. The print is so big and inserts of blank pages used to fill up empty space certainly must be meant for the reader to take notes on. A waste of $18.17"
3,Exhausting poor Dillon.,Jack Higgin's character Dillon was very entertaining character in previous books. He was calm and knowledgeable with a dry sense of humor. In this book I think that Higgins has underplayed Dillon's character to the point of insignifigance. The plot itself was a bit calm with the same idea as a lot of earlier books. Higgins is stretching his star character so much that you have to wonder if Dillon is ready to retire.
2,Was Jack a Ghost Writer on this one?,"I, like most people who have read and reviewed this latest novel by Jack Higgins, have read and own every previous story he has published. This one confused me, and it was almost like someone else was the author of this one or he was in a hurry to finish it. None the less I will be looking forward to his next one and wish that he would get back to his WW11 scenerios."
2,Hate to say it - disappointing,"Like others who have reviewed this book, I have read every Higgins book, no matter what name it was written under. This is the first time I was truly disappointed. The story was incredibly predictable, the dialogue trite. In general, the novel was thrown together without his usual flair. I thought his twist at the end concerning Hannah Bernstein was sadly out of character for the person we've seen in previous books. How old is Feguson at this point and when will he retire?On the positive side, it's an easy read and filled up my time flying cross country."
1,Can't make this book sound any better,"I actually did not read the book, but listened to the audiocassete narrated by Frank Muller. Anyone familiar with the audiobooks industry knows that a bad narrator can make a great novel sound absolutely terrible, while a great narrator can make a terrible novel sound great. Frank Muller is a great narrator and can make magic happen with less than average stories. Unfortunately, Muller just could not make it happen with ""Day of Reckoning"". He could not hide the long and monotonous description of characters that Higgins portrayed, which actuallly proved to be a moot point with a lot of the scenarios anyways. This book doesn't even come close to an anticlimactic ending and in laymen's terms, this novel (isn't good)."
1,How bad can a book be .....,This has to be one of the worst books I have every had the displeasure of reading. First and foremost there is no character development at all. In an effort to write a book that moves along at a quick pace he pushed the story along at a pace that nothing is enjoyable. As to what characterization he created was in many cases offensive. Especially of people of Italian decent. I think Mr. Higgins has let his prejudices shine through in his work. I would suggest he do a little more homework on his subject matter if he is going to create a believable reality for his stories. This is the first book I have ever read by Higgins and I think it will be the last. Thank god I purchased this book at the bargain table.
2,Very weak,"I really like the Sean Dillon character, but the books are getting worse and worse. There is no suspense. There is total casualness in every character because they know they won't die. They could face the Red Army single handed, any one of them, and come out unscathed. So what is their motivation? None. What is mine to buy the next book? None.Also, I am not what one would call a liberal, but the way Ferguson and Blake Johnson run around like judge,jury, and executioner offends even me. If they think you are a mobster or terrorist they kill you, and apparently the PM and President trust them so much that they would never reign them in. I'd really like it in the next book if Blake Johnson would find dirt on some guy who gave a couple of million to the presidents campaign, and plan to indiscriminately kill him. It would at least show something that I could beleive when then President told him to just cover it up."
2,Formula work - only fair,"There are some plots which can only be described as formula. One such plot is the revenge novel - the antagonist has done something so bad the hero is out to kill or destroy him in return.In this overdone genre, for a novel to be worth reading either the characters or the specific situations of the chase must be well drawn and different from what we have seen before in this type of novel.Unfortunately, this latest novel of Higgins offers nothing new or exciting in this regard. The work is pure formula from start to finish. Futhermore, while I have no objection to a novel opening with a flashforward scene, (it is usually an exciting moment, - grabs our interest and keeps us reading) - I hate it when it takes 95% of the novel to reach that first scene in the first chapter.Alas, even the last 5% at the end is unsatisfying.""Flight of Eagles"" was much better."
2,Okay ... so what?,"Here's the cliff notes version:Within the first 10 pages of the book, the reader learns the good guy wants to ruin the bad guy by doing A, B, C and D. Two hundred plus pages later, the good guy has done A, B, C and D. The end.Next book, please."
2,Very Disappointing,"This book was not entertaining in the least. Predictable. Boring. Trite. At times ridiculous. Big print. Almost double-spaced. Much of the plot was just unpalatable. I will not purchase a new Higgins novel in the future if this is what he's cranking out. Ugh, I couldn't finish it fast enough."
2,Predictable and cliche,"This book was so forgettable I had to search Amazon on the names of the lead characters to find the name of the book only a few days after finishing the novel!You see this book coming a million miles away. Higgins simply phones in the effort.I've read other books as part of larger series and I never felt left out. This book was the exception. Unlike the Master and Commander series, or the Leaphorn/Chee mysteries, this book depends on previous books. At least that's my assumption since this book is so lame on its own. For example, you start this book with a lead character, but once we meet the series' principal characters, the first character gets third billing.This book is NOT recommended. I gave it 2 stars because I was entertained moderately and did finish it. (If it was really bad, I would have cut bait!) The character Dillon is somewhat interesting, perhaps more so if you have interest in the IRA, Northern Ireland, and all that."
2,Pretty Lame,"Not very well developed. The plot is shallow and the chararcters (behavior) not very realistic. All in all, mind numbing and predictible."
1,Don't waste your time...,"This book is truly awful. I picked it up to read on my way home labor day - kept stopping to tell my husband how awful it was. Finally put it down and quit torturing myself. There is pitiful character development - characters are introduced by the plenty in the first few chapters, all in under a paragraph. The book is primarily dialogue - and the dialogue is cliched, and forced. Thankfully I didn't pay for this book - it was a hand-down from my Aunt.I am reassured that I'm not crazy after reading these other reviews. How did this ever make it to the bookshelves? Insane that new authors are turned down every day, and this drivel kills trees."
2,Don't read this book,"The Day of Reckoning is an exemplar of a novel at its worst. Sean Dillon and his all-star cast of superhuman vigilantes hardly inspire, and infact tend to irritate.My advice: This book is worse than the plague, so run away from it."
4,It's Marvelous darling,I like the book very much I felt the character were very balanced. A fantastic read.
1,Really lame,"Reading this was a waste of time. Don't bother. The plot, characters and dialog are totally cliched."
2,NOT WHAT IS ADVERTISED!!!,"This is actually just a CD-RW drive, not a DVD-ROM drive as advertised. Do not buy it if you planning to play DVD because it will not work. That is what I experienced and had to send it back. For just a regular CD-RW it is way too noisy and overpriced. I would recommend buying a DVD burner for $10 more and be safe for the future."
1,Absurdly poor service,"Like many others, I've ordered Amazon numerous times, but this instance was atrocious. Having shipped the wrong item like the other reviewers, I decided to opt for a replacement, only to find that the estimated delivery date would be 2 months from today! What's more surprising is that I can go ahead and order from Office Depot via Amazon.com and receive it in 7 days along with the $15 increase."
1,Never again,"I was shipped an incorrect drive 2 times and given the run around about a problem with their bins. Be very careful if ordering this drive, because you will not get the drive mentioned. Never doing business with amazon again."
5,and furthermore...,"I have to agree with Heather on the aforementioned slagging of Ross's solo work. Having been involved with the project, live and in the studio (on two cuts) the work here is a totally different animal to the nucleus of Human Radio. That band was largely a collective and worked very hard at being eclectic, and thus were known for just that. I got to see the Radio several times; even got to open up for them in their Memphis stomping grounds, which believe me, is no easy task indeed. But in all fairness, the two should be treated as separate entities. Ross has managed to parlay his talents into a very promising solo career with the help of many friends and I'm glad to have helped him on his way. So, don't critique too harshly, just dig them vibes, people...Fenner Castnerdrums-percussion (on Off my Mind and Anything You Say)"
4,Good review for the test,"This book got me through the proxy test. Microsoft books are not written well, although they have the information you need in them. That is why I relied on this book. It gave good summaries of what you need to study for the test."
2,Very disjointed presentation,"I read this book prior to taking my MCP test for proxy. Although the book did cover many bases, the book was very disjointed and in my opinion unreadable in many sections. Repetition is rampid within it's pages. I passed the exam, but I used multiple resources before I took the test. I would highly recommend consulting other resources in addition to this one."
4,"Concise book, but to the point","Purchased this book in an effort to pass the proxy exam, and with the transcenders I passed just fine. The book does not have any fluff, it is very to the point, and still makes sense. The transcenders were just an added benefit. Put the two together and you will pass the exam."
5,My boys love it!,"When we lived in Hawaii, this toy had a lot of use at the beach. My boys loved it and it was something they both could ride on and I would pull them around in it. It was hilarious when they would slide off and try to get back on. The only problem we've had is that it is irresistable to other children and as soon as they spotted it, they wanted to play on it too and it was hard making sure everyone got on a turn on it, especially my kids! As far as durability, we've had this for almost 3 years now and even with dragging it on the sand, it is still going strong. I would recommend it but beware if you are in a busy public area, any kids within seeing distance will come flocking to it like magnets!"
5,Ali,My little buddy loves it and can't wait to get on the gator and ride Him in the pool we had to blow Ali up and pretend we were riding him in the water.
3,Ok,"This is not the most sturdy ride on water toy we own nor the thickest plastic, however it serves its purpose."
1,Caveat Emptor,"This release is something of a mess. The most glaring problem is the total absence of subtitles. French is the spoken language for about 90% of the film, yet no subtitles in any language are available. The menu is basically non-existent. The only buttom is for ""film"". There are no chapter points available, certainly no extras.All voices appear to be dubbed (badly), even for obviously French-speaking actors, including Delon.The print is passable, but not much better than what you would see on a VHS copy.It is difficult for me to comment on the film since my skill in understanding French is limited. It appears to be a noir-ish thriller with few jolts. Fans of Delon will enjoy seeing him at his athletic best in some exciting chase scenes, but please do wait for a DVD release properly presented. My copy of ""Les Felins"" arrived yesterday. It's being returned to Amazon today!"
2,Joyless Exercise,This meandering noir brought to my mind a French word...ennui. The story goes nowhere the acting is pedestrian with the possible exception of a winsome young Jane Fonda. The best part of the film is the twist ending but if the rest of the film lays an egg who cares. Forgettable in the extreme.
3,"not bad, not great though","WOW!Great acting (you know what I mean), well directed and produced, good length and variety.My only let down is the lack of extra DVD goodies. There are better titles out there than this, but this is worth a look."
5,"Dorothy, you've done it again!",Another success story for Dorothy Garlock. The saga continues with the Dolan brothers. I can't wait to read the next one.
4,A Great Book about a Depressing Time!,"I read this book from cover to cover in record time. This triology was an amazing view of the Great Depression years. Not much has been written about this time, and it was nice to see Garlock move into a new time on the American Frontier."
2,Not her best work.,This was clearly not her best work. I own all her books and was disappointed with this effort. The idea was great(a newspaper writer finds out a Dr. is selling babies) but why didn't she finish Kathleen's story. I would read the other books in the series and skip this one.
5,My First Dorothy Garlock Book and It Won't Be My Last,"I picked this book up on a whim and I wasn't disappointed. Ms. Garlock's descriptions of the late 1930's in rural Oklahoma transport you there with all the detail. Katherine Dolan gets hijacked on her way into town and from that moment on this is a real pager turner. The relationship between Katherine and Johnny is well written and you can't help but root for them. But other than the romance between Johnny and Katherine, there is also a underlying mystery going on with the mayor and the corrupt police. This book has a little bit of everything and it's set along a time that I haven't seen too many books written about.What surprised from just coming to this website that there was are 2 other books dealing with some of the secondary characters in this book and a book after this one. I didn't think this book needed a sequel but it would be interesting to see where the future takes these characters. I am definitely a new fan of Dorothy Garlock."
4,well written,"I have read all of Ms Garlocks books and I must say these last four were terrific. They are so well written that they carry you back in time to those days and you feel that you are there with her characters. She proves that a book can be so intertaining that you don't have to have the graffic sex descriptions to hold a person's attention. Keep up the good work, thanks!"
3,Burma--NOT Myanmar,"This is a fascinating product but its title is quite frustrating. The name of the nation is Burma--according to the suppressed democratic movement in the country. If one wants to side with the ruling junta, which holds power illegally, call it Myanmar. Those who side with Aung San Su Kyi, the jailed democracy leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, call the nation Burma.Respectfully submitted,"
1,"Not bad, just not great","I like the ""Walk Through on a predetermined path"" feature that you can save as a movie file but what I could then create to make a movie of was at best cartoonish and not what I needed for my purpose. No ability to share my files with AutoCAD software was a disappointment as well. You spend your money and take your chances."
2,Difficult to use,"A couple of years ago I bought a similar product from Punch software and gave up on it after a few days of trying to figure out how to use it. (And I'm very technical and generally good with new software). i would not recommend this software unless you have the time and patience to learn to use it properly.Google recently released a FREE home design software. Much like other Google products, this one is very easy to use - although not as powerful as one you might purchase. Before buying, I strongly recommend you check out Google's offering. Visit sketchup.google.com to take a look."
1,tedious and frustrating,"This software has many options for customizing your decor and design, but just putting in basic cabnetry in the kitchen is a 4 step process per cabinet. I found that moving or deleting something was an even bigger headache. I ended up just starting over from scratch."
4,Punch! Home design program,"I purchased this product with very little knowledge on CAD software, and building guidelines, etc.. However with a bit of time and effort, including reading the Users guide thoroughly, I have been able to create a fairly realistic idea of what I want my new house to look like. (...) I don't rate the Users Guide as a 5-star guide, and the software's Help section is similarly not that great.I can see this software is very powerful, but getting the most out of it is going to take a lot of patience."
5,Pretty cool stuff,"I started with HD platinum and thought it was rewarding as i learned to use the program. In a few hours I had my college house designed right down to my roomate's EXACT computer, and my EXACT bed pattern. Very cool! My landlord loved it, and it's neat how much it looks like it looks in real life. There's still so much more i can do with the program, but after just a few hours I feel like I learned a ton. My roomate used it to design a bar for a school project and the teacher loved it. We both thought it was pretty easy to use and could do exactly what we wanted to do with it."
2,What Happened???,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books about the Merridew sisters and was very excited to get my hands on the third one. However, by about a third of the way through I simply could not believe I was reading a book by the same woman who wrote ""The Perfect Rake"". The story was dull, contrived, and -- I thought -- beyond unbelievable. I felt no connection with the characters, especially Faith. I did grit my teeth and finish ""The Perfect Stranger"", but sold it to 1/2 Price Books as soon as I could. The first two Merridew books were, to me, quite wonderful. This one simply did not measure up."
2,Pft,"Am I the only one who thought Faith was a weak character? All she did was cry and get scared. She was very mature in The Perfect Rake, but in this book she was so pathetic. The plot was stupid as well, Mac was an annoying character, the only one I understood was Nick. I hope Gracie's other books aren't like this."
3,"Good writer, but couldn't sustain sexual tension","I think that Gracie is a talented writer. As the other reviewers stated, the story is quite a page turner. I was enthralled until page 150. As you can probably guess, that is when the protagonists have sex. Unfortunately, Gracie doesn't continue to keep the sexual tension alive - their relationship is just plain boring after that. I think she had them jump in the sack too quickly. Gracie would have kept my interest better had she prolonged that aspect of their journey. To be fair, maybe I would have cared more about the characters if I had read the other books in the series. On its own, however, this book starts out promising but putters out and dies."
2,Quite boring,"I wondered if I ever would get through this book. I did, but running a marathon is easier. I found it very boring. Don't buy it if you don't mean it."
1,Hood pins,"Recommend not using without a latch, the studs broke on me and caused the hood to smash my windshield at 55MPH (very scarey)."
4,What in life isn't a bit difficult?,"The lid is a bit difficult to open and shut, but what in life isn't a bit difficult? Get over it. The thing heats very quickly, I think 2-3 minutes for the minimum setting which is one serving. Pours easily, is balanced nicely for a small hand. The plug doesn't come out but then, it's easy to clean with a damp cloth inside and out. It's just water. I love the shut off. I don't have to worry about it boiling and boiling. Energy saving. Keeps the water hot a good while after it's shut off. Mine is still plugging along after daily use for 5 months and I expect it to continue much longer. Great kettle. I wish it came in colors."
1,Mistake,"Well, when I bought this, I tought I was buying a heavy metal album. But you can see: the photo of the CD is not Long Live the King artwork. In my home arrived ""The Chronicles of Narnia Soundtrack"". It's a big misunderstood. So, if you want Narnia's CD, don't buy it. I don't blame the store for this mistake. Like Hannah Montana says: ""Nobody is perfect."" All I wanna do is advice people who are interested in this product. I hope Amazon.com and the store slove this problem. God bless you all."
3,ok,"warm jacket, easy to wear. Sheds like my dog and feathers poke through clothes!I am thinking about returning-I hope I can"
4,Warm and fashionable,"I purchased this in size small but exchanged it for the XS. I'm 5'2"" and 102lbs. I took this coat to Paris this December and it was perfect for wind, rain and cold. It has a streamline design so I didn't look like a bear in it. My only complaint is that when I wore a black top some of the down lining ""bled""out onto my top. I removed the fur because I got lost in the hood with it attached. I recommend this coat with the above caveat."
3,"Marmot Women's Chelsea Coat, Black, Medium","The color was not black, it was blue, that is my main reason for only three stars. Otherwise this coat is flattering to most body types. It is very well made, material looks good, but holds wrinkles. I have worn it it in below freezing temps and it holds up to the cold and strong winds very well. Hopefully designers will come up with a better fitting hood, it is a little too much for me."
3,Engaging,"Yee, along with various members of the Layton family unravel a tale of ultimate deception by an ultimate deciever. This was the very first book I read in regards to Jonestown. Hands down, this book is among the best, since it was told my several different people, but not THE best. An easy read, but you do not get the full temple story which leaves you wondering (especially if you weren't even born in 1978!) ..."
4,Good vest,This vest fits perfect. I would say I am a wide shouldered type of person and the vest is flexible to fit multiple body styles. I like how many pouches there is for carrying mags. I can hold 8 m4 mags and 4 pistol mags. The holster to hold the gun on the front is a little to be desired. The holster doesn't keep the gun up to the body very well. Most the time the holster ticks more out and allows the gun to snag on things. Other than that well rounded vest.
3,good,this is great vest but how long can ot take to get her especially when you pay over $10 for shiping for me it took over 7 days. still other than that this thing is great and if you r a true paintballer or airsofter u need good gear and this is itPeace out
3,FREEZE!,"I bought this, and now ended up replacing it by a Faux-Kevlar vest (for Paintball/Airsoft).I wore it as my halloween costume (SWAT guy) and I was the best-dressed guy in there.As cool as it is, it just seems to be missing SOMETHING to give it that extra kick-- but it is still pretty neat and useful."
5,INCREDIBLE!,"I was read this book when i was little - it was incredible to open it up and see the EXACT illustrations i saw as a little girl! Im pregnant with our 5th child and when this book arrived, I sat with my 11 year old and we looked through the entire book. Each page I turned was amazing! This book is absolutely incredible and I HIGHLY recommend these beautiful stories for your little one!"
1,THIS IS A PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!!!!,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, THIS ARTICLE IS GARBAGE, I BOUGHT 4 UNIT, ALL OF THEM DIDN'T WORK, I RETURN ALL UNIT AND AMAZON REFUND MY MONEY, AMAZON IS THE BEST PLACE TO BUY."
5,Rub-a-dum-dum!,"This is the ULTIMATE Christmas Album for punk/rock Christmas parties! I have been looking for it for more than 20 years and cannot describe my feelings when I suddenly found it! Right out of the rock'n'roll swindle, funny, rude and festive, I have been playing it in my car since September and most probably I will keep on for long time! Wish I could gather all my friends to enjoy it together! Yo!"
5,Fast Fun and Flexible ways to learn and teach,This is the most useful training book I have ever read. The format is easy to read and it is easy to learn the concepts. I have been doing training and psychotherapy for twenty-two years and I am an NLP practitioner. I learned many valuable new things. Especially the importance of teaching all the types of intelligence's. I now realize that when I get all excellent evaluations except for one or two I may not be hitting that persons intelligence. The marketing ideas are a very welcomed addition. This book has helped my training and business immensely.
3,"Doesn't meet its goal, but doesn't fail to entertain either","The aim of this anthology was to take Lovecraft's ideas into new realms (as the introduction puts it, the Mythos aren't something that need fixing, but that doesn't mean you can't play with them). While it's certainly not pastiche & has some clever moments, this collection doesn't quite succeed in taking the Mythos to brand-new places. Many of the stories follow tried-and-true Lovecraft conventions too closely. That's not necessarily a bad thing; they're still entertaining, but not what the book promises. Some others do succeed in escaping the boundaries of Lovecraft while keeping essential Mythos ideas intact. It's too bad they all didn't.I would certainly recommend giving it a read (I found it at my local library) but don't expect it to be a revolutionary collection."
3,Lighten up people,"After reading these mostly scathing reviews I have only to say...look above. Sure, some of these stories were somewhat trivial (Alan Dean Foster really tanked)but the point is entertainment. As Lovecraft himself often stated ""These pieces are for my and friends amusement"". ""Details"" was wonderful, for Lovecraft veterans (35 years in my case) read and enjoy, and move on. By the way, to all the people trashing this book...when was the last time YOU had something published?smile."
2,"Tough to write, but that's no excuse","Fact of the matter is, even Lovecraft didn't pull off a good story every time, so it's even harder for people who write their own Mythos stories to do a good job. All too often, Mythos imitators misuse the conventions of the genre, with the mysterious elements brought right into the open so the writer's hero can solve them with some half-baked solution. This is in contrast to HP Lovecraft's stories, which mostly ended with the protagonist getting eaten by something or shooting himself. This anthology does not add much to what could have been the richest horror genre of them all. Instead, it just piles on more so-so stories that aren't innovative or all that memorable. It's not that the stories are universally bad, they're just so much less than they could have been, given the material the authors had to work with."
1,Lovecraft Did NOT edit this,"HPL died in 1937. This book was published last year. He did NOT edit it. If he did, the contents would have been much better than the tripe contained therein."
4,Good string from a reliable Brand,"I use Dean Markley on all my guitars. I'm just a recreational player so a set of a string last a long time. Even after a year, there's no rust or degradation of sound quality. Lite gauge that I like tend to stretch a little over time so I tried medium gauge and so far no noticeable stretching or change in tone. Overall a solid string."
1,"Doesn't last, could be my fault though","These strings are great when I put them on my Breedlove Atlas, sounds bright and different from the popular phosphorous bronze strings.It works great and sounds right; however, after I applied GHS fast-fret onto the strings, I feel there's something different about the strings, it becomes dull and kind of sticky feeling, not as bright and fresh as it used to be. After couple days, the strings are just dead. It lost it's bright color and the tone was just muddy with no high's and no definition on the low's, basically a corroded, dead strings' feeling.As a comparison, the fast-fret works great with my MXR and Elixir phosphorous bronze, so imo it's not likely to be the fast-fret's problem.It may be my fault to put string oil on it, but I'm not so sure if that's really the problem.Anyways, if by any chance I need to use them again(during emergence situation i guess), I would leave it w/out the string oil and come back for more reviews."
4,Clever alternative view of history,"I wasn't sure I'd enjoy this at first despite being a huge fan of the SPQR series. It took a while to get started but John Maddox Roberts knows his history and he has really thought through this alternate version, constructing a very 'real' world. Pretty soon I was completely caught up in the story and all I want to know now is when the next book in the series is due out, because I want to know what happens next.And when you think about it - you can't ask more of a series-opener like this, can you?"
3,"A Good Read, but...","The central conceit of the book is intriguing but this is not a stand alone book. Mr. Roberts left himself plenty of room to write a series and it shows. This book does not have any sense of completion about it. The ending such as it is, consists mostly of plot hooks for at least one future book."
5,A novel of alternative history,"This novel of alternative history could also have been featured in our science fiction section but deserves a place under novels for its strong, authentic creation of ancient Rome. Hannibal gives his conquered enemies a choice: exile or extermination: his miscalculation in allowing them the choice returns a dangerous army to confront his children in this powerful account."
4,Comodiiisimos,"Estos capris son super cómodos para entrenar o hacer ejercicios.El siza corre un poco grande.La tela de algodon no es de calidad superior, pero es buena y muy fresca."
4,pretty good,"There is a lot of variety on this CD. There are some good songs that I have never heard of on this CD that probably haven't been released yet..I wouldn't say that this CD is worth the extra money that you pay because it's an import. It's best if you save your money and buy another CD you want. But, if you do get this CD, it's pretty good..about average I would say..not extremely good."
5,Good service and item as desrcibed,The book was as described and sending the purchase was fast and professinonal. I would like to do business later on with this company.
4,"Great details, great backgound on ARC LIGHT","I'm a writer in L.A. and needed to do research on the ARC LIGHT bombing campaign. Jim Hooppaw's book has a lot of great background on the operation. What struck me about this memoir was the reality Hooppaw infused in his prose about the day-to-day life of pilot in SAC. While the actual writing was somewhat dry at points, if you use your imagination, there's a lot of exciting--and funny!--stuff in here. Recommended for anyone interested in military aviation, military careers, Vietnam and the Air Force's role in it, and esp. the B-52."
2,Over priced for what you get,"I bought this DVD expecting more content than there is. I thought the listed running time of 15 minutes was a typo, NOPE. Any search on YouTube will provide you with much longer clips on each character than is provided on this disc. Save your money and watch them on YouTube! Total waste of money!!!!! DVD was not mass produced, but a BURNED copy."
4,Basics of Islam,I think it is good for those who don't know Islam and Muslims as well. It is conducted in a question-answer method which I found boring but probably the author thought it is best in order to explain all this ambiguity around Islam.A very easy read. The explanations are simple and to the point from Muslim scholars from different ethnic backgrounds.A good start for understanding Islam.
4,good costume,"The specs say this product is for sizes 8-10 and says it's good for kids up to 12 years of age. My daughter is 8 and it only comes down to her knees. I'd say it's more for sizes 4-6. However, since it is a robe it's not that big a deal. The robe is a lightweight material - good if it's warm where you are on Halloween. The wands seems to be pretty durable as well as the clasp. It's probably a better deal to the get this whole set for $30 than buy each thing individually."
4,Harry Potter Costume,I bought this Harry Potter costume for my son for Halloween this year and got a great deal on it. If I bought the same items at our neighborhood Halloween Store it would have cost me close to $50. He wears it all the time and is looking forward to Halloween!! Great Deal!!
3,Not Bad for the Price,"This isn't bad considering it will get worn a handful of times after Halloween, but it's definitely not high quality. For the money, it wasn't a bad buy, considering it comes with Harry's glasses and wand. However, the clip that holds the cape closed (the cape that is more purple than maroon) didn't work after one try on. We had to pin it for Trick-or-Treating."
2,very cheaply made!!!,clasp broke immediately and is now no loger useable; glasses are extremely flimsy!!! robe is very large; overall not a good product
4,My 8 year old loved it!,It was a big hit for Halloween. Just wish it would have come with the tie. I had to buy it separately.
2,Harry Potter costume kit - ordinary,"I knew it was a simple costume because of the price, it is an interesting cost x benefit. But in the first use, the button of the costume have broken... My son is using without it..."
3,I did not see that this is for kids,"I looked in men's costume and I bought it, but when it arrived I realize that this is for kids! not adults."
3,NOT As Good As Other Reviewers Have Said...,"The Previous `Negative' Reviewer was right. This book consists of worksheets without any coherent 'introduction', progress and testing format. You won't find anything spelled out and explained, though there are answers in the back.In addition, this DK book (and generally we love their stuff) DOES NOT correspond to what every Fifth Grade class is doing these days. However, I don't really see this as a complete drawback, as one can look at the table of contents and make a decision based on that as to whether it is `right' for your child.The biggest drawback, as I see it, is that you can basically only use this book as a supplement to another text. Or, in other words, It would make a bad homeschooling text.Three Stars. Not a good homeschooling-type type book because you are left on your own to explain things. An okay book if you are looking for additional problems for your child to work."
5,Math Made Easy: Fifth Grade Workbook,"This book is full of great additional practice related to our state math standards. For children who are struggling with Everyday Math and need more paractice in multiple formats, this series is ""the cat's meow."" Children will love the star reinforcement stickers and the progress chart which help them to track their skills. Parents and teachers will love the answer key in the rear where you can not only check work but make a record of specific errors on minatures of the actual worksheets to guide later review and practice once the worksheets have been completed or sent home. These books are a great supplemental tool. I have actually purchased several different levels and find them all well thought out and highly useful for grade appropriate math skills remediation."
2,No instruction!,"Nothing but practice. Unless the student already knows how to do the work, there is nothing in the book to help them."
2,Who's Curriculum?,"This has many ""worksheets,"" no explanations, no really interesting problems, and did not match our fifth-grade curriculum. It doesn't even match our fourth-grade curriculum--way too basic! It's just drill, drill, drill. At least it offers good practice for basics that many fifth graders already have nailed. I appreciate its easy-to read design."
5,Huge HIT!,"My daughter is in the 5th grade and struggles with her Multiplication tables and some other basic Math functions. It has been causing her to struggle for the past 2 years. I've sent her to a Math tutor and have had a hard time finding something that is fun and will keep her interested and excited. This workbook is it!She's a positive reinforcement learner and the gold stars and progress report pages after each short section really give her a sense of accomplishment. She asks to practice more and more and this is during track out time from school. I bought another workbook and it overwhelmed her and she said ""Mom this isn't fun!"" Great tool for parents and kids!"
2,PAGES TOO SLICK FOR A PENCIL TO WRITE ON.,"PROS: Math grade level is spot on. Questions and presentation very nice.CONS: Visually ""blah"" (no color graphics - all ""two tone"" lavender), pages too slick to write on with a standard pencil.I returned them and Amazon credited my account the very day. Awesome customer service!"
5,Excellent for helping your child at home,"I'm buying this because I have the 4th grade version and it's been great. When my daughter has trouble with math at school, this gives me material on which to explain things to her and a huge supply of sample problems. She has a test today on fractions, which she had trouble with, and is a great deal cooler going into it because she drilled at home with this book. So here I am getting the next level to make sure we have it when we need it!"
3,progressive but uncomplete method for beginners,"This Barron's method contains 10 audio Cds and Beginning japanese vol 1 (lessons 1-20) by Eleanor Harz Jorden.The 10 Cds are the recordings of the book's dialogs.Beginning japanese vol2 (lessons 21-35) is not included in this package.The audio Cds are recorded at normal speed, so using them off the book is a bit difficult (in the beginning).The romaji notation in the book is not the frequently used Hepburn system.The substitution drills give confidence when trying to master language automatisms."
1,Unpleasantly suprised by bait-and-switch,"The package says, ""this comprehensive book/compact disc program will help you develop total fluency"", implying that this is a complete course in the Japanese language. However when I opened the package, I saw the book inside is titled ""Beginning Japanese Part 1"" Further review revealed that there is a Beginning Japanese Part 2 book you need to purchase separately. However, Barrons (the publisher) doesn't make a book/CD package available that incorporates the Beginning Japanese Part 2 book, much less anything beyond Beginning level such as Intermediate or Advanced. The package is taped shut so you can't examine it in the bookstore, and it doesn't give detailed list of the contents or any indication that this is just a Beginning Japanese Part 1 course. You purchase the product for quite a lot of money, only to get it home and discover you're getting only part what you thought you paid for."
4,Great audio but book is satisfactory,"I've read many bad reviews for this product from people with no patients. I've lived in Japan for 3 years. I wish I had this study guide during my stay in Japan, it would have help me immensely. I especially liked the CDs, it made so much easier to queue to next lesson."
1,"On cover ""... write it read it"" but book inside says...","I bought this book through another retailer...I wish I could get a refund but it is opened media. The title clearly says ""Mastering Japanese, Hear it, Speak it, Write it, Read it"" One might assume that this system will teach you to do just that... But the book inside states ""This textbook is concerned only with spoken Japanese""...This is no doubt from the cold war era... I only wish I could get a refund."
2,The Flower is Weak,"After reading the 5 star reviewers comparing this disc to my favorite bands (Yes, Genesis, King Crimson, etc.) I decided to check this out. After generous repeated listening, this CD has now become two coasters. Stolt is a very talented guitar player and there are a few truly great songs on this disc but there are more crummy songs than good, therefore, a two star rating is generous."
3,Regressive progressive,"Typically solid, slightly indulgent, and extra-epic release from one of modern prog's least ridiculed compositional units, this two disc set is a little too much of a little not enough to make it stand out in The Flower King's demanding discography, but can easily sit aside lesser impacting work as an expectedly good release with quite a few highlights."
4,Great Progressive Album,Flower Power is a great progressive rock double album. There is a wide variety of tunes with long jams and well written lyrics. It reminds my of the Lamb Lies Down on Broadway.
4,"Sometimes very good, sometime amazing","Some extract of the Garden of Dreams suite are really impressive musically. some top quality vocals and harmonies with great musical complexity.This is one of the best cut from the Flower Kings and it is an hour long.So just for this one, the album worth its price.The CD number two is good but not as great as the first one, in my opinion. I would say that it is 50% of very good stuff, and 50% to fill the CD. Overall, another great album from the band."
3,Okay But Not Okay,"I bought this adapter to get a wireless connection for an old Windows XP Gateway desktop in my basement, thinking that the nice external antenna would help my odds.PRO:The card installed perfectly, connection comes up as ""excellent"" every time and I was into my network and Internet connection within 5 minutes. SMC has 24/7 toll-free tech support.CON:The drivers are not certified for Windows XP and the so-called setup utility crashes itself. It's in the ""Add/Remove Programs"" area but won't uninstall. Don't try to use the utility if using XP... allow XP to manage the network settings and you'll be fine. SMC even recommends it after calling them. The useless utility is there and I leave it alone and use XP to manage settings.Bottom Line:Decent wireless adapter if you're running ""b"" and it does great with my D-Link 614+ router but don't pay much for this adapter. It's worth $25-$30 but not the $58 that I paid for it."
1,skip it,"Set it up along with smc router. No connection from 15 feet away, one floor down. Got a connection with the netgear fm114p , though link quality was poor and barely adaquate speeds.Check for pci cards with external antenna that can be positioned away from the body of the pc or pci cards with removable antenna, so that it can be upgraded with a higher gain antenna."
2,Poor Quality,"This tie arrived in good time, but was a very poor quality. I was extremely disappointed in the fabric quality and the overall cheapness of the tie. Don't buy this tie if you plan to wear it more than once or twice. I don't believe I'm the first to say that I got exactly what I paid for and do not plan to buy a tie that is this inexpensive again."
4,Great Job,"Though this is not the absolute best mini-series I've ever seen, it's certainly up there. I love the reinterpretation of the tea house and Mad March, not to mention the Red Queen! There is some serious star power here and some great imagination. This is what I put on when I want to unwind after a long week. Love it!"
5,So entertaining,I fell in love with this when I saw it on SyFy. So happy to have it on DVD! Andrew Lee Potts steals the show.
4,Alice in a new light.....,"My kids and I had fun sitting around and seeing the ""what if"" of could happen if wonderland could interact with our world. We had a great family time watching this."
5,Alice (2009 Miniseries),This is a wonderful adaptation of Lewis Carols Alice in Wonderland. It has a great modern feel. The DVD was a gift to my 17 year old daughter and she just loves it. I looked everywhere for a copy and could only find it on Amazon.
5,loved it,"I loved this movie, very entertaining. Worth buying. I have watched it over and over again.It has everything, action, romance, relevent material. And still not too heavy.lwilliams"
5,Finally!,"I loved watching this show. If you're one of those people who believes that children's books grow with those who've loved them, then chances are you'll love this adult perspective on ""What happens after Alice leaves Wonderland""?A word of caution though: If you're one of those people who believe that the only way to enjoy Alice is to stick as close to the animated Disney version as possible or stuff it so full of CGI it makes your head spin off, then you shouldn't watch this show. There's very little CGI used and it's a much grittier version of Wonderland that parallels the gritty changes our world has made since the period when ""Alice"" was first published.I would highly recommend this to anyone I know. It's definitely high on the list of movies I'd watch over and over."
1,Less Than Zero,"I hate to say it, because some fine actors (Kathy Bates, Harry Dean Stanton) give an earnest effort in this film, but I wish it were possible to give it negative numbers, because that is what I think it deserves. It is WAAAAAAAAAYYYYYY too long to view as a feature film. The plot meanders all over the place. The production values are embarrassing. (Psst, Syfy, your cardboard scenery is showing.) And the ending is just dumb.I will say this, though: It keeps you guessing. I was constantly asking myself, ""Why am I sitting here watching this?"""
1,The wrong Alice,I order this movie thinking it was the Alice in Wonderland DVD. Gave the movie away did not like this movie.Would not recommend.
1,WAY TOO MODERN,I love the traditional ALICE and all of the fun and whimsy. This is a super strange ALICE. There aren't any recognizable characters (compared to the traditional) and the story takes place during modern times. Really a bore.
5,Six thumbs up,"This DVD was a big hit with my household, ages 14 - 51. The cast is excellent, and I was surprised to find myself truly caring for Alice and the other characters in the midst of this psychedelic carnival ride. There is a connection with Lewis Carroll's story, but only as a springboard into an original science-fiction story.This is not just a rehash of fantasy cliches. It's original at every level, from art design to the story. There are a few underused characters and storylines, and a clunky scene or two; the CGI is what you'd expect from a TV show, but the special effects are in the service of a good story. It might be too intense and weird for pre-teens.Very few shows in any genre have made fans out of everybody in my family, male and female, teenagers and parents. This one got six thumbs up."
5,Awesome,"I just love this version. Very original, funny when it needs to be, and serious too. The actors did great, and the blu-ray looks awesome."
5,Hes mad as a box of Frogs!,"this movie/mini series was absolutely amazing! definatly not for kids though, but fairly mature 11 year olds and up willl love it! it made me fall in love with the Alice in Wonderland story all over again! The casting is great and absolutely hilarious! I've watched it several times myself, and everyone I've shown it to adores it and wanted to watch it again. I recommend this to any syfy or Alice fan!"
3,new twist on alice in wonderland,Great effects in each and every episode. I think the storyline could be a lot better. It will have to be to keep me as a viewer.
5,"Nerdy, Cheesy graphics at times , but great.","Okay, this was obviously a lower-budget film, as indicated by some of the cheesy graphics and some holes in the plot and some small acting flaws, but I love the twist on the classic tale. I'm hooked!"
5,a great remake,"This is a great modern twist on an old theme. The best remake I've ever seen. The sets are fantastic, unusual enough to really grab your attention. The characters radiate authenticity. Makes you think their world could be real. What a great movie!"
2,Disappointed,"I am not a huge fan of the original Alice in wonderland and this one is suppose to take place like 200 years after that, but I was extreamely disappointed with this. I had no expectations of it going in but they just had so many opertunities in the plot line to make some amazing twists and really get the plot line going, but they just went with the cheapest easiest way out every time & its not like they even did it for the sake of the plot line, that was random and non logical anyway at points but I can definitly see why I had never heard of this."
3,A good modern take,"I was entertained...(I did fall asleep at the end). Good acting, good direction...was just hoping for more."
3,I wanted to love it...,"I really did. I loved Tin Man (same director), and I liked Hatter and Alice, but this one didn't draw me in as much as Tin Man did. Visually, I thought it was beautiful, and I liked the concept. There was just something missing.UPDATE: It took me awhile to put a finger on what was missing for me from this movie, and then I saw ""Malice in Wonderland"" (I enjoyed that one), and I realized that ""Alice"" is missing the whimsy. I needed more dark, wonderful nonsense. The Wonderland in ""Alice"" was too sensible for me."
3,"About as much Alice as an ""alice pack""","Alice is dysfunctional and never destined to love until one day...This miniseries gives many popular actors a little more work and allows them to explore their emotional sides. I was waiting for Kathy Bates to pull out a sledgehammer.This film is beyond silly and stilted. It defiantly has no relationship to the Lewis Carroll except the names. This I not a remake or an adaptation.If you forget about Carroll and look at this as a dump Saturday afternoon entertainment, it can be fun. However, it would have been nice to have tossed in a few Carroll type witticisms. You could not really call this Sci-Fi as there is more Sci-Fi in ""The Lone Ranger"" come to think of it this is the lone ranger without the mask.If you expect the classic, forget it. If you are looking for fun, you may find it. If for some strange inexplicable reason, you enjoy this type of film then do not miss ""Tin Man.""Tin Man (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)~ Zooey Deschanel"
5,Such a good miniseries!,"I'd seen this miniseries on Sci-Fi on TV, and loved it so much that I immediately bought it on Amazon and watched it again. I gave up 6 hours in one day to this miniseries! It's just cute and nice and I love it."
4,Cool version of Alice in wonderland,hatter has a great role in the show but I still want to know what was with his punching hand. Was it like Rock?
4,Comphrehensive and Thoroughly Entertaining,"The great philosopher Hegel once said (or so I've read) is that, ""The only thing we have learned from history is that we don't learn anything from history."" That aside, I still feel it invaluable to read and re-read errs of the past, especially of the 20th century. This book is insightful and illuminating for those who, like me, are interested in the times in which their fathers and grandfathers and great-grandfathers lived. I am only 23, and found it both helpful but also sadly tragic, as man continues to struggle with himself and the same old problems in new and improved ways."
5,Modern Times? Modern Masterpiece morelike!,"History is about interpretation.Paul Johnson provides one of the most original and interesting interpretations of the ravaged century that I have ever had the pleasure to read. At times ammsuing, provocative, depressing and inspiring - reflecting well 20th century history - this book is a remarkable, eclectic anthology of our times.I cannot recommend it enough."
5,Enrages the left by confronting them with the truth.,"Nothing makes a tired leftist more furious than an engagement with the truth. Johnson's book, now a classic, provides a schematic for understanding the political and moral bankruptcy of ""progressive"" social movements and the inevitable misery and distress which follow as a consequence."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"""Pseudodionysius"" is right: this book poses as history but is no more than sourish, simple-minded propaganda. As a historian, Johnson is a right-wing gossip. If that's what you want, fine; but if you want history, seen through a keen, sophisticated intelligence, there are many books far superior."
3,First example is clearly wrong,"Johnson, who is an Anglophile conservative historian who hates modern art and opines on stuff he has no competence in, but nevertheless is an entertaining read, got one thing clearly wrong: the first pages (you can read on-line) describe Arthur Eddington's 'proof' of Einstein's general theory, by taking photographs of a solar eclipse. However, Eddington's proof was flawed, as pointed out in the book ""Einstein's Luck"" by J. Walker. This does not detract from the point of the example (moral and scientific relativism ushered in the 20th century), but it's a caveat to watch out for: just because something is referenced by a footnote doesn't make it true. Or as a Frenchman once said, the footnotes are more interesting that the main text sometimes.BTW, I have not read this book, but don't let that stop you from recommending this review as helpful.I will read this book, but buy it used to make sure the author gets no royalty."
3,Misleading quote so far,"A quote from this book ""Einstein was not a practising Jew, but he acknowledged a God.""If this means even though Einstein was not practicing religion he still believed in a deity of sorts,then this is very misleading and can be taken to mean that Einstein believed in God. He did NOT.Here is from Einstein himself :""I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it."" (Albert Einstein, 1954)To make it more clearer, he did NOT believe in Jewish God, Christian God or Islamic God, or any God that deals withpersonal affairs of men."
3,Interesting reading but odd,"It kept my attention but Johnson seemed to omit many major historical events and include many anecdotal personal stories that seemed a little biased, such as pointing out a figures sexual orientation when it had nothing to do with the point he was making."
2,Questionable,"While I really looked forward to the idea of reading a book to get the whole world's history in the last century, I was disappointed by this work. A good part of the blame ofcourse falls on me for expecting a good coverage of the entire world's history by one author.Mr. Johnson is certainly not an expert at many of the topics he covers (and pronounces judgements on). In addition, there are no references provided for many of his interpretations.Given this, I think it is better for someone looking to learn world history to pick up a number of books and develop his/her understanding based on that."
2,"Give me a break...I was born at night, but not last night.","Paul Johnson tells us that ""Eisenhower was the most successful of America's twentieth-century presidents..."" The reasons given to support this poppycock left me incredulous. This author insults the reader's intelligence. His scope and detail are breathtaking and only but a few readers could be conversant with much of it. However, having caught him in one very lame explaination of one very lame president, his whole work becomes suspect. This is in addition to his claims that Harding was also a great president and that the scandals of his administration were ""inventions and myths"". Wonder if he will be so kind to Clinton:) I hope he writes of the current administration...I can not wait to read it:)"
1,An anti-relativistic author who freely employs relativistism,"This book is meant for the easily duped and for those who wilfuly close their eyes to hypocrisy. Mr. Johnson does not attempt to analyze and understand history, he tries to turn into a battle between good and evil. He criticizes relativism, yet is extremely relativistic himself. An example: Mr. Johnson claims that the Soviets committed a wilful act of terrorism when they shot down a Korean airliner. Yet merely a page earlier attributes the American shooting down of an Iranian airliner as a mistake attributable to the extreme tensions of the Persian. The author fails to mention any of the ""red-baiting"" in 1950s America, yet freely condemns others for similar repressions. For Mr. Johnson, Anglo-America can do no wrong, even if it is similar to others that he condemns. When trying to condemn relativism, it doesnt help to be relativistic. Hypocrisy does not prove your point right."
5,An astonishing achievement; a key text of our age.,Johnson surveys our blood-soaked century and its mountains of corpses and lays the blame at the feet of utopian politics and the totalitarian urge to power. American education cannot be considered fully reformed until this book is required reading in every school in the land.
5,An aboslute must for any educated person,"To understand the world we live in today requires an understanding of the century we find ourselves in. To be an educated person requires an understanding of both.Paul Johnson's ""Modern Times"" is a masterpiece. It is never dull, intellectually challenging and wholly readable. This book offers people who are interested in history a unique opportunity to put the Twentieth Century into perspective.It is a must read, as are Johnson's other books, which you will probably read after finishing Modern Times"
2,Typos!,"This book must have been digitized by scanning. In just the first few pages we read of ""seconds of are"" (of arc), ""empircai observation"" (empirical), ""In faet the"" (in fact). Spaces are left out (A.N.Whitehead). Words are oddly or inconsistently capitalized (""in the very Staging"" or ""seventeenth Century"" followed by ""eighteenth-century"" or ""medical and Psychiatric."" Did the author write this way? I expect cleaner text from a professional publisher. Even the cover art is a crude hack--how much trouble would it have been to scan the actual cover? Two stars for a superb book poorly converted."
4,Major success!,"The new CD from the Brazilian teen pair is a big hit, recorded live at Olympia, So Paulo. Including 19 tracks, among which are three new ones. One of the hits on this album is the version of "" Smooth "", (Junior interprets an absolute success from the singer and guitarist Carlos Santana), "" You're My # 1 "" (Junior in place of Enrique Iglesias), "" Bachianas N 5 "", from Heitor Villa-Lobos, and "" Fascinao "", where Sandy demonstrates her beautiful voice interpreting the success that was once immortalized in the voice of Elis Regina. Add to the list of hits on this album "" Imortal"", "" Vmo Pula "" and ""Olha o Que o Amor Me Faz""."
5,Excellent Orchestration book,"This is a great book to learn beginning orchestration. It has useful resources in the indexes, too, which I use frequently. It is a permanent addition to my music library. I recommend all conductors, composers, and professional musicians own this book."
5,Outstanding,"I am a complete novice but I recognize this is the required study program. You must also buy the CD/DVDs that go along with the book.Not cheap, but an outstanding learning tool. I would recommend that you read a book on music theory and composition before buying this set to get the most out of the program."
2,Slight wave to page REALLY MEANS severe water damage,So I didn't place close attention to the description but when I recieved the book it was not at all what I was hoping for. They did not accurately say what I was getting by saying slight wave to some pages. Really the book had severe water damage and was not worth the price I paid.
4,Almost as Much Pleasure as Holding a Purring Cat,"Well, actually, you can read this while holding your purring cat. Anyway, if you love cats, this is a great book, full of one-paragraph tidbits about everything in the world related to cats--their health, different breeds, even off-the-wall things like cartoon cats, cat folklore, the whole nine yards. I liked the section about cats in history, since it added to what little I knew about cats being so popular in ancient Egypt. The book's first section, which explains a lot of mysterious cat behaviors like purring, kneading your belly, or getting high on catnip was really enjoyable. My cat Rufus gives it a 'paws up.'"
4,bigger than size specified,"I bought size S of this jacket, but it turned out to be as big as size M.Otherwise, quality is good. I'd recommend it. But only thing is buy one size less."
3,This is NOT the 14-pin connector. This is a small 6-pin.,"The packaging contains a picture of a larger connector resembling the 14-pin which connects to the back of the Bazooka tube and I was in a hurry when I bought this so I didn't look closely enough at what I was buying. My bad. But anyway, FAST connector plugs in up on the head unit: not the tube."
5,Simply Amazing!,"This harness is simple, efficient, and quick! No splicing, no cutting wires. Hardest part I had was finding a bolt nearby to attach the ground to. I sold my last car and was able to transfer my sub from my Camry to Tacoma in less than 1 hour from start to finish. Great product, would recommend highly."
5,Makes it easy. Makes it fast,"Great and easy!If you don't know where to connect the blue/white cable, connect it to the same one you connect the red on to. (yes so both are on the same line) This worked for me :)"
3,Disturbing Foray Into Sexual Darkness--A Daring French Film That Keeps Its Characters Too Distant,"Dark and explicit, 1998's ""Don't Let Me Die on a Sunday"" is French exploration of deviation and pushing sexual boundaries as a means of relieving life's tedium. It is a disturbing psychological journey of mismatched souls looking for connection, depth, or any kind of intimacy in a post-HIV landscape. While I was certainly inclined to appreciate the controversial nature of the film, it left me somewhat cold. In order for the experience to be truly successful, I felt a greater need to connect with the psyche of its lead characters. Lacking a true understanding of their twistedness and dissatisfaction, the film works primarily as a voyeuristic excursion into an unpleasant realm. Still worth seeing by adventurous adult audiences, the movie should have and could have been a harrowing and wrenching roller-coaster ride into darkness. KGHarris, 8/11."
1,UGH!! Big disappointment,"What can you say about a bunch of people sitting around and watching a friend die from Aids. The story was dismal from start to finish. The characters were unlikeable for the most part. This is one I would file in my BIG MISTAKE folder, as it was a big mistake to have ordered it. Some might call it ""Avant Garde"", but I call it trash and a complte waste of the actor's & director's time to make it."
5,Another good book by Joan Wester Anderson,"As most of her books are, this book is very interesting and as good as I expected it to be."
3,I say the songs are 50/50,"My rating is very biased as I bought this CD for one song Zenon Main Title (Score) - Phil Marshall. I really like how that song was arranged. I listened to the rest of the CD and some of the other songsare good. They bring back memories of some of the Disney movies I saw a while back. Not to say that you won't like them, but some of the songs just aren't my cup of tea."
3,ok but compatible,this mp3/audio player is really fun if you are looking for a cool small mp3 that holds about 45 minutes woth of your music then this is great for you but if you are serious go for something else.
1,Don't bother,"I ordered this based on a legitimate sounding referral mentioned in another review on this website. I couldn't get past the forward. The grammar is ridiculous, not at all scholarly or professional, and difficult to take seriously. I am sending it back at the first available opportunity tomorrow. A red flag went up when I read the author bio on the back cover, which was hard to understand due to the lack of complete sentences. I thought maybe they printed the author's outline notes by mistake. I did not read the book other than flipping through it, so perhaps it gets better, but I doubt it. I am annoyed it costs as much as it did and hope I get a full refund. Too bad, this is a fascinating subject matter."
1,An insult to music...,"Believe me folks, trumpet voluntary does not sound anything like this!!! Having a masters degree in music, it amazes me that people actually produce this hogwash! I suggest typing 'wedding song' on an internet search engine. It will link you to some good sites, and hopefully better music titles. Save your money with this one."
2,"Very fragile, not worth it.","While the cap is very warm and comfortable, it is also very fragile. After having it for only a couple of week the threads are becoming unraveled. Don't buy it unless you like wasting money."
3,Warm but tight.,"I have a 7 3/4 size head. This one size fits all isn't necessarily true. It fits, but I get a headache because it is so tight. That being said, it does keep my head very warm, even when it is -15 F out."
1,Too Small !!,"The fleece Watch Cap is too small for adult wear. Should be sold in SM,M,L,XL. My normal hat size is 7 1/4 to 7 1/2. This will better find my Grandson in second grade. The picture looks like it fits but it doesn't."
3,I love bad movies,"What can I say?It's a low budget production with few redeeming qualities. Unlike other great ""turkeys"" it doesn't have the redeeming characteristics of ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" or ""Robot Monster"".I purchased this because I know the actor who played the cop, at the end of the film, (Jim Ferro) and he had begged me not to look for it.I am still trying to relate the opening sequence (where the teens were stabbed by the rapier wielding killer) to the body of the Movie. Jim finally told me that the director added that sequence when he learned that Jim had studied Fencing in college. I guess if you've got a skill, use it. Even if it has no reason to be in the movie."
2,Dry Cheese !,'NIGHT SCREAMS' is somewhere between 'Splatter University' & 'Cheerleader camp' on the most CHEE*Z'ST slasher film of all times list. A hardcore slasher fan might want to give this one a viewing but all others beware for this cheese is a little to dry.
2,WORTHWILE BUT DISJOINTED,"This movie did not flow like a smooth river. The ending was a bit confusing. Who did David's girlfriend kill and who did the convict kill? Some of the way too many murders were too corny. It is naturally hard to make a good slasher flick anyway with a male as the main victim. The movie did not inform us that the police officer who stopped David's parents had ESP, since they never told him where they lived, yet he led them home. Aside from mastering murdering poetry, the male killer obviously did not master basic acting. Aside from all the negatives though, this movie was entertaining. One negative was also a positive-a male hero is unique for this genre. But it takes the correct ingredients of writing, directing, storyline and climactic struggle for life and death that lasts more than ten seconds. Not a must but, but it is worth watching."
2,Not well designed,"I bought this item and used it for only one month before it broke. The problem is that the basin holds more weight than the handle can manage. So with a pound and half of cooked stuff in the fryer, if you lift from the handle, it will break at the joint. Even though All-Clad is much more expensive, you're better off going with their chicken fryer because they bolt the handle to the basin (whereas Innova just staples the handle on). In fact, most other brands bolt the handle on to their chicken fryers. I don't know why Innova hasn't caught on.I still gave 2 stars because the company accepted the return, although I did have to pay shipping."
4,The only murder mystery about a Canadian league player.,I recommend Valin. Start with The Lime Pit and read them in order
3,Raw live album,"This one is for the fans. I love it, but wouldn't recommend it to anyone but those who already love DT. This is like a collection of good quality bootlegs. Alot of good songs here. A back from the grave release. Let's hope the Toys will record again."
5,Da Bird Puff,"OMG! My cat goes completely bonkers for this toy. I have never seen her contort herself like she does to catch this toy. She leaps and bounds and flips and twirls, all in the love of the chase. I can wear her out in a matter of minutes with this toy. And unlike the 'Lazer' toy she actually gets to catch this one and take out a few fustrations on it.We give it four paws up!"
2,Cat loves it but dye runs,Our kitten loves this but the green dye ran all over his mouth/paws. I'm glad I noticed before it got on our light furniture and carpet.
5,Another great accessory for the Da Bird line of toys,"My cats love Da Bird. Of all of the cat toys that I have purchased, it is only Da Bird that they never tire of. The puff accessory is a particular favorite of my female cat who loves feather boa toys too. It's the best of both worlds for her"

3,Cat is obsessed - but these don't last,"So - I'll preface this with that my cat is a lean 20lbs, so he might be extra hard on them - but these last maybe 2 or 3 play sessions and then they're toast. Makes them a pretty expensive toy - and they're a mess once he rips them apart. That said - the cat loves nothing more than this toy - so it's kind of a special treat. They make a fuzzy version of this - rather than feathers - and that lasts much longer. I'd recommend that for everyday use - if your cat likes it."
4,Kitty loves it!,"I think I have tried out all of the Go Kat attachments for Da Bird wand. Kitty freaked out over the genuine ""Da Bird"" and ""Fur Fun"" and probably wouldn't stop playing until the toys were destroyed. ""Kitty Puff"" probably comes in third BUT still enticed him to play and he did not go into destructo mode. For the most intense fun try genuine ""Da Bird"" or ""Fur Fun"" (still a good toy if the clasp breaks, toss it or hide it peeking out from under a blanket) and for a longer-lasting toy try ""Kitty Puff"". The ""Sparkler"" was Kitty's least favorite but go on what you know about your cat's affinity for shiny-ribbon stuff."
3,My cats prefer the other attachments,"My cats love the Da Bird toy, but they weren't really too thrilled with this attachment. They prefer the sparkler and the original feather attachment over it. If there is nothing else to play with, it will do, so maybe they're just spoiled, but they seemed to be waiting for me to put the other attachments back on. I'm guessing the other attachments are more exciting because of the sounds they make, while this is a rather silent one."
3,"fun toy, but easily broken by cats","We have a bengal and a bengal mix, if anyone knows about these breeds, they play somewhat aggressively. They liked the toy, however, they broke the bird attachment and all 3 replacements within the week.I would recommend the toy, but also recommend purchasing many replacements."
4,this is great,"Since I recently started listened to Miles Davis, I have become an avid Mike Stern listener. He plays on two of the songs on this CD and sounds great! I also appreciate hearing great musicians play which is what I hear on this CD."
5,Maximum Enjoyment!!,"Ever since reading ISABELA'S DREAMS, I have anxiously awaited Tracy Montoya's next book -- and MAXIMUM SECURITY was well worth the wait. Great characters, compelling plot, sizzling chemistry -- Ms. Montoya captured it all. From the first page I was hooked and couldn't put it down. Billy and Maggie will steal your heart with their haunted souls that can only be healed by the other. I highly recommend MAXIMUM SECURITY."
5,A real eye opener!!!!!!!!!,"Ready to take a trip into the HCSA's records and find some real answers to many unanswered questions over the last 30 plus years? Gary Cornwell has done just that with his excellent work Real Answers.As a former prosecutor for the Department of Justice, Cornwell knows how to obtain and present facts. This book is the perfect example of, what I would consider, his best work. Cornwell has an exceptional ability to make the reader want to know more.Unable to put this book down, I was completely drawn into 1963 and the streets of Dallas. Cornwell presented information in a clear, concise and well-researched manner. Cornwell is able to sift through the assumption and present the Real Answers.For anyone interested in the JFK assassination, or for those researching the case, here is a definite addition to your collection. I have read over twenty books on the subject and for the first time, Real Answers makes real sense. A job well done."
2,Real Answers - Nothing New,"Real Answers is just another question and answer book with the same stuff we've heard for years. The one thing I did like about it was that if the reader wasn't interested in a certain topic, he could skip that part and go on to the next. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this mediocre book."
2,Lacks Content,"This book deals mostly with the findings of the Select Committee on Assassinations. It does not however review the bulk of those findings. It instead revamps much of the basic events surrounding the assassination that are already considered common knowledge. You want this book to reveal something exciting or new as you read it , but that just never happens. Other than some interesting discussion concerning the gunshot acoustics, it would be totally lacking. Also, a lot of ""fill-in"" with personal opinion about the Oliver Stone movie or why people are still fascinated with the case. Totally lacking substance. Recommend for novice assassination buffs only."
4,"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrob",The lion the Witch and the Wardrob was a great book.when I read this book I pictured this in my mind.As I pictured it in my mind in my mind I noticed that there was a couple mistakes in spelling.It was so cool to raed it.I was so moved by raeding it.
5,The first and one of the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"In the time of WWII, four children find a wardrobe that leads to another world. A world will be saved...A destiny will be chosen...and the Chronicles...will begin...All I can say is that this is one of the best books in the chronicles, the first one published. I have been to the website for the film and I cannot wait until It comes out! When I saw the teaser trailer on tv a few weeks ago, I got really excited. I let out a loud whoop of joy and my mom came to see what was wrong. It reminded me about how our copies of the Chronicles were getting dusty. I've read it 10 times since then. I also recommend the other Chronicles, too.If you love The Lord of The Rings, Harry Potter, or fantasy in general, or you can't wait for the film to come out, READ THIS BOOK!P.S. I also found out that if this film goes well, they might do PRINCE CASPIAN, VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER, THE SILVER CHAIR, and THE LAST BATTLE!!"
4,"This book is good, it is full of adventure, and it is easy to picture.","The lion, the witch, and the wardrobe is about a lion, named Aslan, fighting against the white witch.Four kids named Lucy, Susan, Edmund, and Peter join the war, when Lucy finds Narnia through an old wardrobe. I liked the part when Lucy, Susan, Edmund, and Peter Join the fight against the white witch. I didn't like the part when thw white witch tortures Aslan."
5,"The Lion,The witch,and The Wardrobe","I like this book because,when you see the movie or read the book,it is like you are in Narnia.When Peter,Susan,Edmun,and Lucy go it to Narnia,It's a Magical Land Ruled by Azland . And the White Witch is trying to take over Narnia.Then they both go into war. that was one of my favorit parts in the book.My favorite part is when they go into the wardrobe and end up at Narnia.I really really really hope you take the time to read the book The Lion,The Witch,and The Wardrobe,and also take time to go watch the movie it will be the time and the moaney.Please read the book."
5,The Lion The Witch and the wardrobe,This is a great book to read it has a lot of action in it the best part is the war against the White Witch and her army and the lion Aslan and his army that was really cool I also like the part when they go in the wardrobe and enter the land of Narniaand meet tumnas the fawn. then Edmond meets the White witch and then they meet the lion Aslan and then the battle begins.
3,Rangel's review,"When I firs read this book I didn't like it because is like a little boy's book. After the second chapter I started to get more into it, for the first time in my life I enjoy reading more than ever.What the author does in this book is that he repeats some phrases many times, and that's why I thought it is a kids book. But this is the kind of books that repeats phrases so you can remember it like I'm doing now.He describes everything really well, and clear so you can imagine it as he wants you to imagine it.This book is about 4 young English boys that are send to another place because of the war, they were send to the professor house. There they found a new imaginary world inside a wardrobe. Narnia is the name of this world, and there is a witch that control everything so it is always winter but never Christmas.There is a lion called Aslan, he is coming to save Narnia. Aslan and the boys fight together to defeat this witch."
2,BORING!,i hated this book it had no action or suspence.when lucy and susan get to the war at the end its already over.this is a boring book the only part i liked is when edmund got captured by the white whitch.
2,Just Dreadful,"Honestly if you're not between the ages of 7- 10 you should not waste your time with this book. I mean really what was all the hype about. Where's the magic, the most magical moment for me was where the witch conjures up some Turkish delight I mean is this C.S Lewis finest use of imagination, a tool which is unlimited and free. Where's the action. And what was all this stuff about biblical analogies (unless you include the phrase ""Son of Adam and Daughter of Eve"") .For all I know Enid Blyton could have written this, for Christ's sake even Santa Claus makes an appearance in this book. I was so disappointed in this book I could not continue till the end."
1,a long and tiresome book,"I didn¡t like this book much because the story was boring and I don¡t like fantasy story. ¡Fantasy¡ it is just made up by author¡s thinking and it doesn¡t give me any interest. It can¡t be happening in real world and also it is not even true story, I mean that¡s why people call ¡fantasy¡ but it is just author¡s imagination. I can¡t agree with story because I¡ve never done before and I know that is not a true.This book helped my English study but still I don¡t like story. I heard that this book (the lion the witch and the wardrobe) is the first original fantasy series in the world. I feel sorry for C.S Lewis (author) but I don¡t like this book. This book is not for my age and not my type. This book will appropriate to under 12 years of age. Actually I don¡t have any idea but one idea came out of my head, which is ¡I think, I don¡t like this book¡."
4,Children's Book Club Selection,"We thought this book was easy to read and contained just enough details to make it perfect. It was very well thought out. The author had good ideas such as the time difference between Narnia and Earth. It was interesting and completely different from Harry Potter. The author was very clever and came up with lots of great twists. We liked how the youngest sister, Lucy, not the oldest brother, started the whole adventure. We liked the way the lion had more power than humans. We also liked the way the people couldn't own Aslan, the lion, like a pet in a zoo because he was King."
5,Great !!,"This book it so wonderful!! I loved it. IT was very funny , but some times a little scary ( but not to much ) IT's Just so moving- I couldn't put the book down!"
3,IT WILL BE LOVED FOR YEARS TO COME,a lovely book with beutiful disciption. it is a wonderful book for advanced readers in grade3.
5,A good for children,"I read this book in class time. This book felt to me specially. Because this book is my first experience that I read foreign language book.I think this book is good for little children. Lucy, who is main character, is very strong girl. She go to strange world. alone. but she doesn¡t have anything to fear. If any other children are in like this situation, they will cry or find their parents. So children learn bravery.Also, children learn curiosity. Because Narnia is new world, In imagination. Although main character and main story is same. Narnia is different from person to person. So children can make their Narnia. Probably It is more interesting and fun. If I read it when I was young. I wish to recommend this book to parents who has little children.There is a many other useful thing for child. For example trust, friendship, bravery and so on."
5,Great Book!,"I thought this book was great! I had fun reading it. It felt like t was there in the story. Some of the characters are Peter, Susan,Edmund and Lucy. They enter a world called Narnia through a wardrobe. Read it!"
4,You really need to read this book,I think that the book is very interesting and that Lucy is very brave to go into the wardrobe but when her brother starts to eat the turkish delite that was very bad mistake because he did not know the lady that started feeding it to him he did not know so I would not have tried it but anywas it was a very good book in the end its not really that bad!
3,"The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe",This personally was not my favorite book. I never really got into the whole story and I didn't like how they practically didn't care about going back. I also didn't like all of the battles. Some people who might like this book and the rest of The Cronicals of Narnia are people who are into battles and mythical stories.
2,"The Lion,The Witch and ,The Wardrobe","The book I read was ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"". It is a book that you might need to read more than one time to understand it. This book has a good storyline, but it has too much detail. There are lots of boring conversations in it. The setting is a little awkward because it has a lot of strange creatures living in it. This book has a lot of made up characters in it, so I would only recommend this book to people who like to read fairytales."
3,"Book Review for The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe in my opinion is a great book for everyone to enjoy. All the characters are fun and full of imagination .I most like this book because of the hook it gives you,and not knowing what comes next. My favorite character is Edmund, the troublesome one, because I can relate him to my younger brother"
5,The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe,"The author of this book has an awesome imagination! The names on the title all stand for something, that you will find out about in the story.I recremend the whole series of The Chroniclals of Narnia."
5,English Project,"""The Lion the Withch and the Wardrobe"" by C.S. Lewis is a very interesting book. I would say this book would be most enjoyed by a reader that has the ability to exspand the imagination. This is a wonderful book that really boggles the imagination of the reader. The different charaters are a real important part in this story because of the far out possibilities of who or what they really are. All the diversity is wonderful. This book is for readers of all different ages that like to use their imagination, or basicaly just suspend reality for a while. As you read this book you can laugh, cry, and even catch yourself being amazed through it all. I can say that i think this book is awesome. i have told alot of people to read it. I have even started reading the entire series of this book. so take our advice and read it to find out for yourself."
4,THE BEST WRITER........,"The Lion, the Witch and the WardrobeBy: JonathanThe story is about four kids finding a wardrobe after being moved from London because of the war. They moved to an old professor's house in the country. The kids names where, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. Lucy was the first to find the wardrobe. In the story the kids get into a conflict with the ""White"" Witch from Narnia. The White Witch was trying to control the city of Narnia. The kids where supposed to help Aslan to bring freedom back to Narnia, but the witch wanted to control everything and for that she needed to destroy the kids.I enjoy reading this book because the story line was interesting and different. The author created the magic wardrobe and it was fascinating to be able to enter a different place and be able to come back to the house. Also the characters all had different powers, and they individually had something special to do in Narnia. The battle was very impressive. I really liked this book."
4,Great old fashioned adventure,"I loved this book as a child. I remember having it read to me when I was six. Of course, I was oblivious to the Christian theology running through it at the time, and in later books some of the references to other races is questionable. But this first book remains a classic and an innovator. If you enjoyed it try reading Lightsleep by Matthew S. Batham, a new fantasy about a bratty boy who finds himself in another world."
5,Praise for THINKING ABOUT CRIME,"""Here we have solid insights into a system gone awry. The cost is needless suffering and huge distortions in our spending priorities.""--Paul Simon, former U.S. Senator, Illinois"
5,REVIEW,"From the Publisher: ""No one would have chosen the criminal justice system America now has....it is too severe, too expensive, and locks up too many black and poor Americans. In this brilliant book, Michael Tonry shows how things came to be as they are, and how they can be made better."" Carol Moseley Braun,former U.S. Senator, Illinois"
5,One of the Best,"i first heard Lil Cuete on a compilation cd and i knew from the way that he flowed and from the tight lyrics that i had to cop his cd, i picked it up at the Portland Lowrider show where i also met Lil Cuete in person. He was a down homie and signed a poster for my brother, my girlfriend and i. when i first played his cd i knew it was ""One of the Best"" cds that i have heard. he flows tight all the way from the beginning to the end. people should definitely cop his cd, you will not be disappointed."
5,great album,"first off that scoop dude is lame just check the type of stuff he like forget him. Lil Cuete is dope you can't battle that to much. The man can flow give him props and this album is good. I been supporting chicano rap for so long, these guys are good but they don't get the props they should get. Black, Chicano, White whatever this dude is tight and can't to many rappers stand up to him. I like I'm Trippin, Sick and Twisted and I Roll Slow the most but like I said the album is bangin all the way through."
1,whaaaack,this is one of the worst rappers of all time from what little bit i heard i wanted to throw up i wish i could give negative stars because he would get it. but all you wannabe gangsters will probably buy this chumps album he suxxxxxxxx
5,Swedish Cool,"I discovered Bo Kaspers Orkester while I was living in Stockholm. At the time, I was still learning Swedish and just enjoyed their smooth, jazzed style. But when I began to understand the words, I liked them even more. It's perfect hanging-out music, an album I listen to over and over - in the same way you can listen to ""Kinda Blue"" all day long.Get this album, it is a great music country's most recent take on Swedish Cool."
5,As sensitive as a burn,This autobiographical novel of the coming to age of a sensitive intellectual is the early poetic work of a writer of great promise who unfortunately died young.
2,Can't judge a video by its cover,"I purchased this as a used video. Unfortunately, I cannot review the actual product because I did not receive it. Inside the Dink cover was actually a Looney Tunes movie. Quite disappointing for my son."
3,Great music ... a year ago,"These albums are great if you're 9 months to a year behind the music scene (or maybe if you live far away from a big city). The music is like a greatest hits album for the year of house music, with a list of chart toppers. Unfortunately for anyone who's really into this music, all of these songs have come and gone. They've been played over and over again and a house music enthusiast has had enough of them. The house/dance/trance music genres just move too fast for a greatest hits album to really be great.Overall, I'd say this shows a lack of creativity on the part of the producers. A really good producer/DJ and a willing record company could spot the hits as they are just starting to hit the underground clubs, get them on a CD like this and publish it before the tracks' expiration date. Unfortunately, Robbins Entertainment seems to be more interested in the safe route, resulting in a CD of great music ... a year ago."
1,SMC High Gain Antenna only works with wireless bridge,"I naively ordered a SMC wireless antenna hoping to increase my 802.11b range. Once I received it, I learned that it attaches only to an SMC wireless bridge - not any of their access points. Now I have a piece of hardware I can't use and am frustrated that the product description didn't give me that critical information."
