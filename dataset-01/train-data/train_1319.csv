3,The Haunting,"The Haunting was an okay book.It was kind of scary at times, but the ending was a surprise. It wasn't something you had to think about much. The book is nice and short, so it dosen't take a long time to read.This was the first book I read by Joan Lowery Nixon and i think she's a pretty good author. All in all I liked it."
2,The Haunting,"I suppose this was an okay book. I had to read it for school. It was relatively short and pretty easy. You don't really have to think about it too much. It was nice to have to read a normal book for school for once! I didn't really LOVE this book, but I also didn't hate it. All in all, it was a fine book, but I really don't understand why this writer is so popular. She just seems average to me. I don't think there is anything extraordinary about her or her books."
5,"The Haunting,","Do you love suspense? The type of suspense that leaves you bitting your nails? Then you'll love Joan Lowery Nixon's ""The Haunting"".This might be the best book I have read this past summer. A young Katherin has to move into a deceased aunts house. The haunting history about the house has Katherin on a perilous journey to find the truth and help her family from harm. I strongly recommend anybody who loves suspense and mystery to read this book!"
2,Captivating? NO!!!,"This book was okay. That's as much as I can say without delving too deep. Eh, what the hey. The book had the allure of a good read. And it was a good read to some extent. It was something that didn't take long at all to read. I give this book two stars because of it's failure to truly captivate MY imagination. Surely this book gave great detail and would ultimately ensnare the imaginations of others. This book seems to be directed more towards a fourth grade class. My class was assigned this book. My FRESHMAN class. I think if it were rewritten, the next version would be quite a bit better. I DO recommend it to those who are younger than I! Perhaps fifth grade and under! Not any older! Please! Spare them the agony! I read this book in about 60 minutes total. I could guess the ending by chapter two I think. There's what, maybe sixteen chapters? I wish all those who willrad this in the future a ""Good Luck."""
3,Large Storage ........ Same problem with loops,We bought 2 sets of these storage bins ... the first set was fine when we were putting it togeter ..... the second set was a nightmare ... the loops are too short and don't fit over the wood beams .... I'm going to return them to toys r us and before i exchange them i'm going to open the box to make sure the loops fit....If we didn't have this problem ..... the storage bins would be fine... they hold more that i thought they would.Good Luck
1,Looks tiny,"After seeing this online, I thought it might be good for storage. I went looking for it at Toys R Us to make my decision. It looks tiny. I don't see how it could hold more than three small toys. It looks like a waste of money."
3,Deteriorated Pretty Quickly in Sunlight,"I've always bought gray tarps and wanted to try this brown one. It is ""heavy"" in weight. It blocked the sunlight more than gray tarps, but I'm disappointed that it is not lasting as long as the gray tarps. It's quickly deteriorating."
5,genius,Imaginative and fun. The beautiful illusions only co-exist with the storybook like photographs.
1,Really? $100.00?,"Is that $100.00 price tag a typo?The one star rating is for the absurd price tag.The actual event was fantastic. Bon Jovi kicked booty, Cinderella was great....fantastic concert.$100.00? For a DVD?No fooling?Wow.I'll buy the video."
3,feel-good 70s,"I chose this CD because a few of the songs I love and could not be found on other CD collections. However, a few of the tracks seem out of place on this CD. Still a good one, though."
4,Not quite as interesting,"I had trouble getting into this one but it was worth it! Now, on to Round 3!!!"
2,Rather disappointing,"After a great start, this 2nd book is a major disappointment. Most of the interesting parts are given past tense, and basically dont hold any interest.... Sorry Dave, you didnt reach your usual standards on this one..."
2,fails to help,"Sorry, any text book without a glossary fails its primary goal of making its information accessible."
2,won't record an audio track,"this interface was working fine with the midi i have recorded with my microkorg. however, when i try to record an audio track with my keyboard plugged in as an instrument input,it will not record audio. i have tried many different ways of getting it to read audio from my keyboard, and i have not been able to do it. the midi is great. the audio just doesnt read.if anyone else has had this issue, or has any information on how to fix this problem, please add a comment.i have also called avid and protools about this, and aside from them being extremely hard to get ahold of, with case numbers and continuous emails they have sent me when i have missed a call, they also were not able to help me record an audio track of my microkorg to the daws i use, which are logic, garageband, and protools.hopefully i can figure something out, or i am doing something wrong."
2,Broke after about 1 year,"Does its job but there's a couple of problems that I encountered.1. When Windows Vista came out, I couldn't use this product for over 3 months! M-Audio's engineering team couldn't get a driver out in time for Vista. Makes me think twice about getting another M-Audio product.2. One of the Mic Inputs failed to work after 1 year. Didn't feel like going through the hassle of getting warranty (not even sure how long the warranty is)."
2,No Very Windows Vista Friendly,On a 2.2 G Quad Core AMD CPU with 3gigs or RAM I found it impossible achieve any recording that did not have severequality issues. Attempted to adjust latency but to no avail. Perhaps it is a Windows Vista compatibility issue.A clue is that the unit does not include driver for Windows Vista. I had to download them via M-Audio's website.
1,Its awesome when it works...and that isn't very often,"This thing works about 30% of the time I turn it on. I get static all day with this thing. No way i can mix like that.M-audio's support doesn't help either. Its like talking to a tree.I waited months for an updated driver, and then still the updated driver made my issue worse.I've also bought a midi controller from them. Same issues.I'm not giving them anymore money. I'm not saying you should or shouldn't, just be very very careful and think twice."
1,Not worth the trouble,"Very disappointed with this one. I own the Firewire Solo, but needed something as a DJ interface with the ability to cue songs. Downloaded the latest driver from their site to go along with my Intel Mac (Leopard) and experienced all sorts of issues. Scrapped that driver and decided to go with the one in the box which didn't even read the preamp correctly and set it up as a 0 in/2 out. Scrapped that driver and downloaded the driver that was one version earlier than the latest, just to see. More problems. If you're not going to build something that actually works, just don't put it out until you've got it fixed. This will make it hard for me to trust M-Audio with anything else for the future."
1,No power supply included? Really?,It doesn't come with a power supply so that's another 30 bucks right there. Sheesh. So frustrating now having to wait another week for the power supply to arrive. Should have been included.
4,Good product for price,This was a great purchase for my small setup. I plugged a condenser mic into this in conjunction with an Oxygen 49 keyboard and reason. I make little ditty's and it's fun. This device does what it says. I am happy with the product.
1,would be zero stars if available,"I attempted to use with an XP upto date HP laptop. There is minimal directions for use, but I followed them. Loaded disc slected install, received message my version of windows is not supported. Went to web site downloaded the specific drivers for XP service pak 3, installed them still no luck. My system does not recogniaze the device when I plug it in,maybe my usb does not have enough juice, There is a jack on the back for a wallwort but the plug is not a standard size and will not accept any that I have available.I can only find M-Audio power supply's for firewire series. I don't want to throw another $25 away to M-audio when the item is not listed for USB series. I will try to return this but I'm certainly out the shipping costs"
2,Unable to get it to work on Windows 7 x64,"This device worked find on my Mac, but I was unable to get it to work on a clean install of Windows 7 x64.After wasting several days and reading their tech forums about it, I gave up.The installer refused to install it. It starts and then says it encountered an error.I'd be careful if I were planning to use this on Windows. If you have a Mac you may be OK.However, the manufacturer notes that there may be some issues if plugged into a USB 3 port. So if you have a brand-new Mac with only USB 3, you may have some audio issues. Read the support forums about this before making a purchase."
2,Wrong Software,"I bought this, waited almost a week for it, and it's not compatible with Windows 7 so that was a big let-down. It didn't say what it WAS compatible with here on the site, so I didn't know. And I'm a guy who's just trying to start a small home recording studio. Now I have to return it and go through more trouble. Once again it wasn't stated what systems it was compatible with. So for those who don't know and are trying to find out, it's compatible with Windows XP, Vista, and Mac."
2,What a let down,"They advertised it as if it comes with some good audio editing software. It doesn't, unless you count demo's of Ableton (Blah). I expected Pro-Tools, and got Ableton. Ableton, by the way would have been junk, even if it hadn't been a demo. I got a pro-tools demo that doesn't work with my OS (Win7). If I wasn't so lazy, I'd have sent it back. If anyone wants to buy it for $10 off the price, if you have audio editing stuff to work with it, it's probably perfect. I wouldn't know yet, cause I've had it for 2 months, and still have never been able to use it. The hardware works with Win& but you have to get the drivers off the net. The ones on the disk aren't any good."
1,IRQ Hell,This thing outputs a horrible hi pitched buzzing noises for me whenever my cpu is under heavy use. Tech support gave me beta drivers that blue screened my machine. Taking it back.
1,better suited for an IT tech,"i'm computer literate. not a pro, but i'm in my 30's and been using the internet since it was invented by Al Gore ;)i cannot get this to work.i've done all the updates and spent countless hours on M-Audio's message boards and FAQ's trying to get this to work - nothing. but please don't take my word for it - go to M-Audio > community > user forums > USB audio series and look for yourself. i would recommend to M-Audio if they have a product with this much trouble maybe you should discontinue it and start over again. you seem like a good company that made a bad product and won't let go of it.i've had mine for over a year and have not once been fortunate enough to use it. very sad - i just want to make music with my guitar on my PC."
3,Some handycaps,"It's a good product.I just think that there are some... kind of errors in the communication.1.- In any place say that after installation you must left the device on. If you turn on the computer with the FTP off, the audio devices doesn't work. I spent a whole day trying to make the audio work and only the next day - 'cause i forgot to turn FTP off - I had all the resources working.2.- The Pro Tools M-Powered 7 Demo it's a f****** trick. Why they didn't say that saving and exporting were deactivated? I could avoid install that useless deception.Live Lite, even it's almost a demo too, didn't have those paranoid attitude."
4,Does a great job for the price,"I bought this product after a long research,and am actually pretty happy with it. This is my first audio interface, but I only spent about an hour or so to figure out how to use it. Ableton software is also very easy to install an use, which is another plus. I have Vista 64 bit on my PC, and everything works without any problems. The only annoying part is that if the PC goes to sleep, you need to turn the interface off & on again once the the PC wakes up to be able to use it, but no big deal in my opinion. I like the design as well, so overall it is a good product in my opinion."
1,M-Audio has poor suport and don't know there own products,1st Bad review of all time. M-audio tech line said this would work with Mac leapard. Bought it and they said it doesn't yet when I called tech support because the drivers would not work. They then released drivers and they do not work. M-audio tech support said sorry maybe in 6 months well be able to fix it. There sales department is misinformed and their tech department is not knowledgable whatsoever about MACs. The product does work on my PC but the included software is worthless.
2,Avoid if you're running Vista...,"I don't write a lot of reviews, but this thing is such a pain and M-Audio are so obtuse that I had to write one. I knew that the Vista drivers were in beta when I bought it, but I figured that would not last long. Well, the last update was in June of 07 and they will not give a clue as to when the official driver will be out. The beta drivers suck and I have had nothing but glitches and problems. The hardware is all plastic and OK for the price, but without proper software it's almost useless. I just ordered a Firebox, hooked it up in 5 min and it works 10x better. If you're running XP this might not be an issue, but the truth is the $100 more for a firebox is worth every penny. M-audio and Mackie are both dropping the ball on software support lately and it's going to cost them in the long run. The forums are full of people telling them that, but not a lot of results yet. We all hate Vista, but that's life. Get your drivers up to date."
1,Frustrating,"Software seems sketchy. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. Very unreliable. Every time I run it, it has some type of issue. I wish I would never have purchased it."
1,"Great item, poor quality","The m-audio FTP seems like a great tool to have, and I'm sure it would have worked amazing, except it came broken. The FTP did not work. This was an impulse buy. I should have not bought m-audio. They are renowned for the bad quality and short product life."
3,It works nicely if you have the time to make it work,"The M-Audio FTP does work nicely. Like many others (whose questions I see in various forums), I had difficulty getting it to work and I had difficulty finding out why. This could save you hours:If you have Windows XP, there is a column in the m-audio.com knowledge base (go to support then knowledge base), and after entering USB audio devices/M-Audio Fast Track Pro and Windows XP, look for ""not connected"". This will walk you through what will most probably happen to you when you're trying to connect the thing.Another thing that was not clear to me when installing is that this device replaces your sound card. So go to your device manager and turn your old sound card off.The device is good and I'm using if for fairly high level recording now. Having two inputs that double as 1/4 inch and mic inputs is very nice to have.So, aside from it being troublesome to get going, I recommend it."
4,My go anywhere tool,Good for its size and what it does. Unless you want to carry around half a studio with you this does the job just fine if you travel from place to place like me. I like to keep 2 setups. My quick setup for travel and my hard setup for when I'm back home. My gear surrounds both of these styles. This one is in my travel kit along with my AEF filter my other road dog tool. I finally figured out how to make a studio in any hotel room I'm at. Life is good!
3,Depends what you NEED,PROS:1. Sound is outstanding with LINUX... see: [...]2. So you can setup 4 outs and 24bit. Nice.CONS:1. Inputs DOES NOT work with JACK_AUDIO_SERVER2. I repeat: AUDIO INs do not work when running Linux and JACK. BIG BUMMER. Why did I buy this again?!%^
3,Power Supply?,The item didn't ship with a power supply so it is difficult to determine if it works as advertised yet.
5,Terrific Product from M-Audio,Excellent product. Many features and very pro. Very low latency. So happy with the product that I sell it and now got it the fast track ultra 8r.
2,Bad drivers,"Had this unit for a week. The first day it was installed I received a DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE blue screen of death (BSOD). I experienced random BSOD every day until the driver was uninstalled. My machine: Dell w/64 bit Vista. M-Audio acknowledges the problem but, get this, their solution is to never put your PC into sleep mode, or turn off or disconnect the unit before you do. Not a hint of a commitment to fix their driver. So back in the box it went. Making music is supposed to be fun, not frustration. Thank you, Amazon, for making returns so easy."
2,USB 1.0 DONT BUY unless....,"ohkay . so i bought this thinking it used a USB 2.0 port. IT DOESNT .i was trying to record one day all was going well , i herd my self in the monitors it sounded amazinggg... but then i pulled up a beat i had made and proceeded to record vocals .. well NO PLAY BACK .the usb 1.0 can not SEND AND RECEIVE ... data or what have you .. idk the techs.. but basically you can NOT record and hear your beat through the interface .. kinda sucky ... cuz then you would have to use you lame computer port. for your headphones .. im returning mine and getting the fast track ultra. 2.0."
4,Good but with a flaw,"I bought the Schutt Michigan mini-helmet over the Riddell because I read reviews where the Riddell uses a sticker for the helmet design which could be uneven. The Schutt is painted on which is good and bad. The design looks great as a whole, but there is a thin green line between the blue and yellow where they mixed. A drawback of being painted I guess... which is unfortunate because otherwise the helmet looks great."
3,A simple fun 83 minutes.,"Though this film was released in the early 90's, it has a very 80's feel to it, compliments of John Hughes maybe. It's your typical teen comedy in many ways, just not one of the better ones. The plot was rather weak, though it did make me wonder what I would do stuck in a store overnight. Frank Whaley did a decent job as the town liar/geek/loser. Also the ending was fairly abrupt, and made you wonder what happened to everyone. However, there were two things in the film that were literally outstanding, and both of them were in Jennifer Connelly's tank-top. A must for fans of hers."
2,"Yes, It Definitely Has Jennifer Connelly In It","I watched this movie for the first time in many years the other day and had to come to this board to see the comments. Just as I thought, a lot of guys oogling Jennifer Connelly. And with very good reason. This movie was the worst in the John Hughes collection, but I can't tell you why because I didn't care a thing about the plot or the lead male character or the robbers or even John Candy, of whom I was a very big fan. I just know that Jennifer Connelly is an absolute doll in this movie, whether it be on roller skates or on a mechanical dime-store horse (especially a mechanical dime-store horse). In fact I think she comes across sexier here than she does in The Hot Spot, where she shows even more of her assets.Alas, today Jennifer Connelly has gone the way of Calista Flockhart and lost the babyfat and become a serious actress, even carting home an Oscar, but her role in Career Opportunities will be the one remembered by fans years from now."
1,"Sole redeeming facet: the Goddess, Jennifer Connelly","This is one of those movies that is vastly improved by muting the sound and turning the subtitles on. It consists of painfully bad dialog, implausible characters and a nonsensical plot. The sole purpose of watching this movie is to see a talented and very beautiful young actress named Jennifer Connelly."
4,A great corny movie from the early 90's,"This is not the best movie. Although there are a lot of ""grade A"" movies out there the vast majority of films are not. This movie is a great B-grade movie. This is a corny movie from the 80's. It's great for a laugh when those A-grade movie plots become to formula driven to entertain you. If you understand that it is okay for this not to be the best movie, then you understand the necessity for B-grade movies. This is among my favorite B-grade comedy movies. I give it four stars. I hope this review helps you decide to buy this movie."
4,Jennifer Connelly is Really HOT!,"Watch the movie the first time cause jennifer connelly shows offalot of cleavage. Watch it again and again cause it is a pretty funny movie, in a [weak] way.Man she is fine!"
3,Career Opportunities,The Town Liar (Frank Whaley) Gets A Job At The Local Bargin Store Working Nights And Accidently Gets Locked In Overnight With The Town Knockout (Jennifer Connelly) And Two Bumbling Burglars...An Enjoyable Movie To Watch On A Sunday Afternoon...
4,It's actually quite funny and Connely looks great (as usual),It's surprising to find that this movie actually works in its own right. Although lame in parts overall it should certainly have you watching it through more than once (providing to don't mind John Hughes' kind of humour) Jennifer Connely of course looks great too
3,"Boobs:Yes, but I like the pitifulness of high school life...","Jennifer Connelly is beautiful and sexy.But really attracted me to this film is the conversation between Whaley and Connelly about those four years of high school and what it meant to both of them. Connelly found them to be the best years of her young life, never to be had again. Whereas Whaley found them to be four years of agony and persecution and was absolutely enlightened when they were over. Both characters seemed stagnant in their growth due to their affliation to those particular years.This seems apparent to anyone who has ever went to their high school reunion. Also, I happened to work for Target(store 100) at the time of this release. It was the best job I had ever had. So there is some bias here."
3,frank whaley yeah!,"This movie looks like it was filmed when the script was half written. As a result, the second half is a drag. But it's worth seeing for Frank Whaley, who's one of the the most natural, charming comic actors to appear in a long while."
3,Only if you like Jennifer Connelly,"I couldn't stand Frank Whaley's character, and I despised the script, but I liked Jennifer Connelly a lot. So, if you are a fan of Connelly's this is a must see - otherwise, a must to avoid."
3,Kinda good,"This is silly stupid fluff. Jennifer Connelly and Target are only reasons I didn't give it two stars. It is simply hysterical to see the shelves of Target merchandise of the late 80's and early 90's, particularly the lamps. How far have we come in the evolution of lamps! Lamps were butt ugly back then. Jennifer Connelly is quite beautiful here. The scene of Jennifer riding the mechanical horse is very amusing. This movie is strictly a guilty pleasure."
5,Classic movie,I bought this movie because I love the 80's and Jennifer Connelly looks great in it too. Fun to look at the old Target store and go into one today to see how much they have changed and the types of products we bought back in the early 90's.
2,Ugh!,"Little did I know as I watched this movie that Jennifer Connelly would be a huge star or that a Target would acutally open in my neighborhood in the years to come. But even that doesn't mitigate the bad taste I still have in my mouth from this movie.Try not to watch it if you're in a career slump or in between jobs or depressed! I was all of the above at the time, and watching this was the worst punishment I could have inflicted upon myself.This was surely the last hurrah of 20something-bashing, you know, the kind of uneducated diatribes in which this demographic was perceived as lazy, unambitious, boring, and jaded. In reality the 20somethings were in a slump in the early 90's because of a recession and a poor job market, not because of any lack of ambition on their part. But you wouldn't know it to watch this movie. It does great injustice to GenX."
2,Widesceen version is not anamorphic,"I saw this in theaters when I was in high school and thought Jennifer Connelly was the most beautiful woman in the world. I don't think I saw it in it's entirety again until I bought this DVD.It's not one of John Hughes' best work, but it's still relatively amusing. I'd give it three stars except the widescreen version isn't anamorphic so watching it on a widescreen television looks weird. You still see rather thick black bars across the top and bottom and the picture is stretched horizontally so everyone looks a little thicker than normal. I know some widescreen movies still have bars, depending on the aspect ratio. I thought I may have inadvertently changed the settings on my TV/DVD player but when I played another disc, everything was fine. Therefore, the transfer on this DVD wasn't done very well."
4,"Excellent movie, horrible print",I love this movie. But the print quality is pretty awful. It looks like someone put a good camera in front of a TV from the 80s and recorded it.
4,2 special features missing,"great movie and great soundtrack, but...insert mentions ""Film Highlights"" and ""Theatrical Trailer"" which aren't included."
5,"Like New, wonderful!","This Book I bought was like new, the seller described excatly what it was. It came in timely mannner."
3,Ghost Town Buff,"Fascinated with Ghost Towns since my days at the Saturday Movie Matinees,11 or 12 years old.Watched with interest the towns, especially ghost towns, in every Western I ever saw. Have many books (Lambert Florin etc)on towns and gold rush days.Bought this tape, found it OK but too generalised, not enough actual footage of Idaho ghost towns and too much about gold rush characters."
5,Sci-Fi at its best,A massive work of genius. Hubbard has taken Earth and created a planet thatsincerely belongs to him and him only. No other author could write such pureand powerful science fiction.Johnny Tyler Goodboy is a very believable hero in an unbelievable world.Terl is as vicious a villian as has ever appeared in the genre.I highly recommend the reader take the time to read this massive work.The time is well spent.
2,A book not quite all that it's cracked up to be...,"L. Ron Hubbard can write, but for some reason chooses not to in Battlefield Earth. What he places there instead is phony, unbelievable melodrama and humanocentric garbage that is as about as realistic as a three-dollar bill. Yes, one man can go from becoming an illiterate savage to hero of the galaxy, but it's not as likely as Hubbard makes it seem."
3,At least it's better than the movie.,"L. Ron Hubbard was a pulp writer back in the day, and he hadn't improved much in 40 years. This book is full of bad writing, logic holes, and poor characterizaton (Chrissy, Johnny's girlfriend/wife, is pathetic).But...Boy, can he make you turn a page.After a slow opening, the book never let's up. Johnny and freinds solve crisis after crisis with ever increasing stakes. Sure, some of it might not make sense, but it sure is fun.This is a definite guilty pleasure for me."
1,Who would buy this dreck?,"Do yourself a favor, and skip this one, unless you like reading really badly written books.Used bookstores sell this junk for about 50 cents. That may be more that this book is worth.I wonder how many Scientologists have been told to post great reviews here and to buy the book to drive the numbers up, exactly like they have for other books?"
3,The Book was longer but better,"I read Battlefield Earth in 1991 when it was first published. At first I found it to read very slowly, because LRH went into so much detail(wordy). The best part to the book was the Irony of the galactic bankers showing up to reposess what the humans had fought so hard to win. The movie didn't even attempt to tell that part of the story. Yes, it is stupid to think that books would still be legible and many buildings would still be standing, but the movie's 1000 year old harrier jets was even more ridiculous. Overall, a Readers Digest Condensed version would be a nice compromise between the lengthy book and the butcher job movie. LRH explored the concepts of superior beings ""out there"" and how our tendancy to hurl object blindly toward them may come back to bite us one day. Likewise, he made the point that ultimately the banks will end up owning everything if we are not careful."
2,Just another space soap opera,"I was very disappointed by this work, which so many people hail as a classic. The book began well and has an interesing premise, but the story quickly dissolves into a simple, predictable plot. There are very few characters for a book of this size and even these few are relatively two-dimensional. However, my biggest critique of this book is that Hubbard simply takes too long to tell his story. This book could have been much shorter without losing any of its essence (this shows how much extraneous material the book contains). This is one of those books that makes you wish you had done something else with the time you spent reading it. I don't recommend this book and fail to see why it has attained such popularity."
1,Pathetically Bad,"This book is written at no better than a 12 year olds level. The plot is unbelievable and as if that weren't enough, the book is boring. Skip this one."
1,A flawed formula book,"I just couldn't get into this book. Hubbard tried everything (except interesting dialogue and believable characters) to keep my interest, but failed. I was mildly amused by the Earth-centric nationalism (humans are nice, aliens are evil), but was baffled by the lapses of internal consistency. Example: an indestructable aircraft that could withstand multiple direct hits by thermonuclear devices but was disabled by one man with a socket wrench. Things that make you go 'hmmm'. Sometimes you CAN judge a book by its cover.."
1,Battlefield Garbage,"Although I suspect this review will not be published, I must say that I think Battlefield Earth is the worse novel I have ever attempted to read. Granted, I only made it through half of the book, but by this time I was so nauseous from the sentimental, pro-American drivel that I simply could not finish. I read it whilst working in Ethiopia where there was little or nothing to do in the evenings. It is a testimony to the book's quality that I prefered to bore myself to death than read about 'Jonny Goodboy Tyler'. The name alone speaks volumes."
1,...Scientology Claptrap,"I've never been able to make it more than half-way through this snooze-fest, so I won't attempt to review it. I would, however, like refute the opinion that this book has no connection to Scientology. At some point it is revealed that the reason that the Psychlos are so evil is because at birth, they have an aggression device (or something, who really cares) implanted in their brains by a sinister cabal of Psychlos called the Catrists. That's Psychlo Catrist. One of Scientology's main tenets is that the profession of psychiatry is evil and responsible for most of the evil and sickness in the world today (or something, who really cares). For those of you playing along at home, we have:psychiatristPsychlo Catrist.Please, stop the inanity."
1,Horrible!!,"How in the world did this become a science fiction ""classic?"" This is drivel, junk, crap! Is it only Scientologist propoganda that keeps this book in print?I had my doubts about the book as soon as I read the author's introduction. It was the most arrogant, self serving piece of writing I had ever read. Hubbard constantly criticized other authors and books, and he insisted he and his choice few were the only ones who wrote good science fiction.Then I started the book, and I couldn't make it past page 250. I finish almost every book I read, no matter how much I dislike it, but this one I just couldn't continue. The writing is plain bad, written in the style of a high school student. I still gag thinking about it.So please, stay away from this sewer of a book. Maybe it will go out of print soon if you do, making the bookstores a much safer place for the unsuspecting browser."
1,"I laughed, I cried, I kissed 3 bucks good-bye","I laughed at the STUPID plot. I CRIED that I wasted the 3 bucks I KISSED GOOD-BYE when I bought it at a used book store. The only people who would want to read this drivel, would be hardcore scientologists. If you want good sci-fi, stick with Frank Herbert, Isaac Asimov, or (one of my fav's) Piers Anthony. I'd just as soon read one of the Dick and Jane books as read another one of Hubbard's. Unless you are a fan of Dick and Jane, I suggest you make like their dog and ""Run, Spot, Run"" far away from it. Oh, I did find a good use for it. I used the pages to help start fires in my grill. I have enough to last through next summer."
1,Unbelievable........,"Battlefield: Earth. I don't even know where to begin to describe this book. There are bad books, terrible books, and there is Battlefield: Earth. I won't go so far to say it is the worst book ever written, as I have not had the displeasure (nor do I ever plan to) of reading any of Mr Hubbard's other ""works"". I am firmly convinced that the glowing five star reviews that appear elsewhere were written by brainwashed Scientologists. That is the only explaination that I can come to. Stay Away! You have been warned."
1,hubbard should've took writing classes,"all of the characters in this novel are flat, are not even enjoyable, and no sentmentality can be gained.hubbard definitely needed to edit this book, but why? he may have wrote half of this book, depending mainly on a field of writers. think of battlefield earth as the simpsons; without the interesting characters and involving plot."
5,"Intense, Intelligent Reading","This book is an epic spanning several universes, starting humbly in a dirty section of a used-up planet where only a few survivors are left of the original inhabitants and these don't dare come out of hiding...This is Earth in the year 3000. Suspense, intense battle action, romance...it's all there.One of the very best."
3,Its ok...,"NowI'm not gunna say this is the worst book ever, or that it is great! It certainly isnt either. The book is filled with action, and mystery, and deadly, no escaping situations. It is also filled with a lot of crap.Here is the up side!1. Lots of action gun-fighting, ship flying, hand to hand stuff.2. Mysteries and questions to never be answered!3. Deadly situations, and lots of bloody scenes.Downside :(1. Uses scientific phrases WAY to much. These people are supposed to be back in cave man type stages why is he talking about molecular transactions?2. The way he talks about other races and women is justa little off.3. REALLY LONG!Ok thats it. Just a few more things! BEWARE: This book takes an EXTREMELY long time to read. I've been reading this book for a year and I'm not even half way through! 1052 pages of microscopic typing! It is not an easy thing!"
1,Don't believe the hype. That's all it is.,"I have only two explanations for the number of 5-star reviews for this over-sized dime novel. Either the Scientologists are ordering their flock to put good reviews on the Net, or mass hysteria/stupidity has enveloped large parts of the nation. ""The best book ever written?!"" My God! Hubbard can't even get his subjects and verbs to agree. Of course you can't really trust reviews that still use the idiotic neologism ""sci-fi"", so that knocks half the reviews out of contention. People, I beg of you. Avoid this book. Waste not your time precious. L. Ron. Hubbard's work is just a mediocre imitation of the work of Philip K. Dick. And this book is the greatest example of his mediocrity."
2,What an amazing dissapointment!!,"My brother read this book some ten years ago and this past summer he told me that is was an incredible epic adventure. I wasn't at all, put off by the incredible length (somewhere around 1,050 pages). In fact, that encouraged me even more. I love a book you can really get into. But this book never got my attention. I assume L. Ron Hubbard can write an interesting book, but Battlefield Earth wasn't it. But I have to give it some credit. It did have maybe 3-5 interesting ""action"" sequences. But you'd think a thousand page sci-fi novel would be loaded with action. And you'd probably expect a 1,000 page to have an amzing 200 page climax or something. But as a matter of fact, after about page 600, the action stopped. The last 400 pages were just a bunch of pointless sh*t. In conclusion, this is the book for anyone who likes books that have almost no action."
5,Woohoo,"This book is fantastic, great, and wonderful. This book is a bible to all who want to write in the future. The characters are almost real enough to touch and the book is impossible to put down. I just got done reading it two times in a row."
1,Quite Disapointed,"Couldnt finish the book, the fact that the aliens who took over the Earth in 9 minutes, couldnt remember 3 thousand years later that there was a sentient species they defeated to conquer it really didnt make any sense."
3,Good Pulp SF,"I read this book when I was a kid, and as such I enjoyed it immensely. I must have read it at least 3 times. However, from an adult perspective the book loses some of its gloss next to actual good science fiction, which this isn't. While it is entertaining shlock sci-fi, it ain't no _Ender's Game_.The plot is somewhat simple, though drawn out; the good and bad sides have no ambiguity; and most of it is highly implausible. While I would recommend this book for a light read or maybe for young teens, I also am highly suspicious of the rave reviews and would not be in the least suprised to discover there's a scientologist conspiracy behind them.Once again, fun pulp, not good literature, though undoubtedly Hubbard's best work (avoid Mission Earth or any scientology books like the plague)."
5,I couldn't put it down!,"This is one of the best books I have ever read! The intricate plot with it's many twists and turns kept me riveted. The character developement was SO well done that I felt I was ""in their heads"". The description of the many action sequences was so masterfully done that I felt like I was living the story as I read it. The satire was subtle yet brilliant and many times I found myself laughing out loud. A perfect example of this was the hero's cunning way of manipulating his captor without appearing to do so. The many highs and lows that the characters experience left me wondering ""what will happen next?"". I HAD to read on to find out! In closing, I must concur with Heinlein and Van Vogt. This is a masterpiece. I recommend it to everyone, Sci-fi fan or not."
1,A rag - Don't be misled!,"This ""book"" is a cartoon written by .......... Cliche upon cliche, with a childish plot. Save your money ................."
1,A book only a cult member could love...,"Battlefield Earth is, without a doubt, the worst book I have ever managed to finish reading in my life (if it was so bad why did I finish? It's a long story involving a prolonged hospital stay with no access to TV or radio). This book was written with a plot, characterization and storyline that a three year old (and only a three year old) could appreciate - 2 dimensional characters, a fifth rate plot, and third rate writing. Don't waste your time or money - there are so many better things you could be doing."
1,Don't be fooled,"The glowing reviews are all written by rabid Scientologists. This is probably the worst book ever written, hardly worth the paper it is written upon. It is a bunch of low level anarchic crap written in ten days by a megalomaniac on speed. Compared to the movie, which is the worst movie ever filmed, this book is horrible. Furthermore, the English is so bad, and the grammatical errors so abundant, it is practically unreadable. The only thing worse than this book is dental surgery."
3,Mixed feelings,"I would have rated this book five starts if the author had stopped at around page 450. The crescendo builds and builds from the beginning, culminating in the final battle and drone event, and then totally bogs down for another 600 pages! Yes there are a couple of interesting events and battles but gosh it just DRAGS on and on, and not in an exciting, epic kind of way like the first half of the book. The last couple hundred pages were so tedious I found myself skipping over large swaths, and not caring a hoot about the characters by the end. So my advice: Read the first 450 pages, then skip the rest. Please don't waste your time reading hundreds of pages more just to find out what happened to Psychlo! Plus it's quite obvious once the other species start gathering around the planet looking for ""the one"" - doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out. I fell in love with this book at first and ended up hating it by the time I was done."
4,Pure Science Fiction,"Far above his Mission Earth Series, Battlefield Earth is one heck of a good book. Despite its length, I can usually finish it in three days or less. It's that riveting.Jonny versus the Psychlos.Humans are no longer the dominant species on Earth. As a lark, one psychlo takes a human, Jonny, and teaches him quickly through technology.One thing leads to another and Jonny begins teaching other humans, they learn of their past, and set about expelling the Psyclos from Earth.Full of action, and rags to riches. Enough to satisfy anyone."
4,A good read,"I found the book hard to put down. Last time I read it I was a fairly young adult, and missed the influences in the material. When I read it most recently, I enjoyed it as entertainment as well. No, its not the most technically proficient book I've ever read.I found the introduction and ""biography"" fascinating; they really helped me get a sense for LRH through his own words and the way he describes his life. The text itself should be read for insights into his ""psychology""My great regret about owning this book, and unfortunately it is really water under the bridge, is that by purchasing I was effectively donating money to the church of scientology. I wish that I could undo that."
5,The best SF novel ever! It captured me from page one!,"Battlefield Earth has no comparison. It is simply the best SF/Adventure novel I have ever read. It sings of the possiblilities of man's future and triumph. This book captured my attention from page one and didn't let up until page 1000+. It had more plots twists and turns than I have ever seen, and left fireworks of excitement in its wake. This book could lose the glib reader easily, from its many changes in direction of the story and its unpredictable conclusion. For the true fan of SF, however, it is simply one hell of a ride! I had a hard time putting it down. It kept me reading until all hours of the night. Don't be intimidated by its size, I have yet to read anything that moves faster than this one!"
2,I liked this book. ALOT,"I did. I thought it was smart, action oriented, and with cool characters. One problem, though. I WAS 12 YEARS OLD.I re read it as an adult(18, not 78) or rather , tried to re read it. The silly, sexist and obvious book might as well have tagged the characters with GOOD and EVIl in huge capital letters, cause it's so obvious which one is which. The book is so lean on making the hero great that it's insulting.Still, I gave it 2 stars, cause if you're 13-14 you might like this book."
2,Apacolyptic Child's Play,"A friend of mine recommended this book to me, saying it was a classic. While the begining was mildly interesting, the overall story just didn't jell for me. There were so many inconsistencies...eg. A gigantic alien war plane that could withstand a nuclear assault, but was blown up by the hero with a simple wrench? I might have suspended belief had the characters been even the slightest bit interesting, but Hubbard's hero, Jonnie, has all the depth of a pizza pan. The story dragged on after about page 200, and the narrative was reminiscent of a Hardy Boys novel. So, while I might recommend this book to a young reader, I would advise others to steer clear. There are simply too many other good books to read."
5,This was one of the damn best book's i've ever read.,"I've always enjoyed science fiction books, but some lack detail, or have no plot. When I first saw this book, I thought it would drag on because of it's size, but after reading, I found it was totally entertaining, and never had a dull moment. L. Ron Hubbard knows exactly how to piece together time, places, and event to come out with, what I would definetly call, an awesome story"
5,Mr Hubbard's Best Work,"This Book will rank as one of the greatest comedies ever. Although it is a bit long and windy a.e gaseous, (something I know quite a bit about), it is a timeless treasure which I recommend to all my physclos friends, and to any good writer who wants to see how funny science fiction can be."
4,An epic saga,"If your looking for a great ""star wars"" like adventure yarn this is the winner. Don't let the length intimidate you, its an epic on a grand scale."
4,too bad he didn't stick to syfy,"good read. has nothing to do with his delusion of scientology, except the bad guys are psychologists. hard science fiction."
1,should i even say anything?,"you see, im 14, and i read the book. i enjoy complex and thoughtful books. such as sci fi and fantasy. the beginning was interesting... but... it just gets worse as it goes along... personally, the only reason im really reading it for now is to say i read a 1,066 page book.... which... it no real big deal... but... it just, wasnt my type, for whatever reason, it wasnt for me..."
2,Too long and boring,"This is a very long and boring book. Actually, some of the concepts and some of the action is good. If the book were half as long and the characters more believable it wouldn't have been bad. It is dated though and women basically don't exist, not even alien women unless they are in servile roles. Probably all SF from this time period suffered from that so this book can't be blamed for that."
3,Good Adventure Candy,An enjoyable space opera adventure that's too damned long. I still haven't finished it!
1,For the love of God don't waste your time,"I pushed through 800 pages of this utter bile and then couldn't put up with any more. This book is by far one of the worst books I've ever encountered in my adult life. At least half of the book could have been edited out and I hope that it was written for perhaps 2nd graders or 3rd graders - it is truly atrocious and unless you are in fact in 2nd or 3rd grade, please don't waste your time on this nausiatingly bad drivel."
1,BEWARE OF 5-STAR REVIEWS,"I was given this book as a Christmas gift this year. After one hour, I stopped reading it. I've read more interesting bus stop signs that this drivel. The character were totally on-dimensional and the story ws severely lacking. As for the good reviews it gets here, they're more likely from Scientologists. I should know since they use to come and buy the books in bulk where I used to work. When we reordered them, we sometimes got back the very books we sold. This method made it seem Hubbard was a best-selling author. Now it has been adapted to the Internet to make look great on this review board. If you want a great Sci-Fi book involving the mind I HIGHLY RECOMMEND William Gibson's ""Neuromancer."" Gibson is a FAR better writer on his worse day than Hubbard on his best one."
3,pleasantly surprised,"I have to admit, when I began reading this novel, I wasn't expecting much. Not having much use for scientology or L Ron Hubbard, the only reason I began reading was because I received the novel as a gift. However, once I got into it, I found it entertaining. Hubbard's writing was actually better than I thought it would be. Some may complain that his writing style is somewhat juvenile, and I would agree with that assessment, but then my question is - is there anything wrong with that? I imagine that I would have enjoyed the novel more back when I was a teenager. The novel definitely has the feel of 1930s or 1940s pulp science fiction - but even that can have a certain charm, if done well. I don't know if LRH purposely wrote it in that style or if he simply fell back onto his most comfortable writing style, but the end result is actually kind of fun."
1,WATCH OUT!!! It's Abridged.,This version is only 8 hours long. The box even says it's abridged. The unabridged version is 45 hours. I hope I helped out.
3,Starts great but then...,"The first 1/3 of Battlefield Earth is absolutely stunning, some of the best sci-fi I've ever read. Then the main story comes to a rather abrupt halt, but Hubbard just keeps on writing. I've gone from riveted to bored, wondering if I can even get through the second half."
1,"Science friction, not science fiction","I thought I would read this book before the summer movie came out. Checked out the rating (4-1/2 stars) and took the plunge. What? This has to be one of the all-time worst science fiction books ever written. The plot is entirely ridiculous, the characters are one-dimensional, and the science (whew!) is rotten. I only finished the book for the entertainment value of seeing just how far L. Ron Hubbard could push the ridiculous. I've been reading (and occasionally writing) science fiction for forty years, and this is the lowest ebb of the genre, the very nadir of its class."
1,Awful,"I have been a reader of science fiction for many years and generally enjoy it. However, this is the worse book that I ever read to completion. I found the characters stilted, the plot totally unbelievable, and the writing mediocre at best. I've already spent more time on this review than the book warrants..."
4,Talk about a thrilling ride,"I'll have to admit the only reason I first picked up this book was to get a background on the movie coming out this summer. After only a few pages, my imagination was captured, and I felt compelled to read all eight billion pages of it. Although it did lack in character value, and there always seemed to be a new twist around the corner, very few sci fi works come close to this immense undertaking. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys sci fi."
5,One of the best science fiction sagas written!,"True, this book starts out a little bit slow, but once you start getting into the story it won't let you go until the bitter end. The plot is well written, believable, and offers social commentary that very much applies to what is going on in today's world. Even if you find it boring at first, just stick with it, it does get much better!"
2,Mindless Human Nationalism,"Immediately finishing this book, I actually thought I had enjoyed. I later realized that I had succumbed to a pathetic form of hero worship that the book expounds fully. Some credit should be given for the creation of the ""Psychlo"" species, but the book and the author disgust me to no end. First of all, the book is entirely too long, it is not a ""saga"" as Hubbard claims because the book is too intellectually sterile to deserve such a title. The book praises humanity and the supposed ""triumph"" of the human spirit incessently, and by the end of the book the reader finds himself simultaneously revolted and bored. Moreover, the author is predictable and the great majority of alien species have little depth. At the end, the alien civilizations follow the human example and adopt a democratic system, as if that has proved even marginally effective. Please, save yourself valuable time and read Asimov or Clarke, just read anything instead of this trash. A tremendous disappointment."
1,Terrible book - do not read.,"I don't know how there are so many 5 star reviews for this book. I read it ~8 years ago, and I still feel strongly enough about it that I'm leaving this review *just so I can rate the book as 1 star*.Painful to read, insulting rubbish. Not fit for consumption by humans of any age."
2,"First Half OK, but the book goes overboard in the end.","I just finished reading this book, once you get past the major battle in the first half the author goes overboard. That the low tech humans in the book could overcome the all obstacles the author puts before them is totally unbelievable."
2,"Readable, but flawed","As a typical Campbellite hero myth, dressed up in a sci-fi cloak, this book is engaging enough. It has enough of a plot and adequate characterization to sustain its length.However, it fails as sci-fi. True science fiction, in my opinion, needs a hook, a concept that justifies its status as speculative fiction. Arthur Clarke has a mysterious spacecraft, Rama; Grege Bear has a physics-defying structure from the future orbiting the earth, and Herbet blends politics and a Messianic religion to create Dune.Battlefied Earth, unfortunately, has none of these. The story could quite easily be transplanted into a mundane setting: make the Psychlos invading Romans, and Johnny and his clan the subjugated Celts of 56 BC, and the story could remain precisely the same. There is no food for thought, no mind-expanding concept. Just typical pulp sci-fi."
1,Horrible!,"I've never liked juvenile-male science fiction, and this ranks down there with the worst of them. If you get part way through the book and keep going in hope it gets better- DON""T BOTHER, it never does - 1000 pages of poorly written cliches."
3,WYSIWYG-What you see is what you get.,"This book is exactly what it says it is in the introduction, a 1930-40s style pulp fiction adventure. Those people nostalgic for this style of writing will enjoy this book. I found this book somewhat lenghty and felt it should have been 2 books (the latter half was not quite as well developed as the first half) yet it was still enjoyable none the less. This book is very reminicent of ""Flash Gordon"" episodes, the serial not the 70s movie. Like many novels from the 40s this book is more fantasy than science fiction. The science in this book has little relation to our current understanding of how the universe works. All in all, a fun, nostalgic read which makes very few demands on the reader."
3,"Enjoyable, yet lacking","Battlefield Earth is the ideal action/adventure yarn, so those looking for a deeply engrossing-thought provoking plot need not apply. There is little character devolpment, but that isn't really necessary in such a book-but is missed regardless. But other things simply cannot be ignored and are inexcusable in any genre. One, the alien antagonists are doubly dumb, I doubt that any of them graduated grade school, while the primitive humans are amazingly astute and able to bring any situation to their advantage. And two, the book is simply too long for what it is. Mr. hubbard could have had the same effect with at most 500 pages. 1050 is just too many. All in all, the book is a good read, but know what exactly what you're in for before you dive in."
5,Hate reading but couldnt put this book down,"I was on a vacation with my family and we went into a dollar store and i saw this book and it was a dollar so i bought it thinking ""oh what the hell"" but once i started reading it i couldnt put it down. It has good action and drama scenes and just draws u in more and more. Dont waste your time with the movie it is more of a parady that ""if the military jets still worked"" and werent rusted and old as in the book. I hate reading and made it through high school without ever reading more than 5 pages in a book but could not put this down. If u are into post apocalypic settings and battles BUY THIS!! u wont be disappointed. =]"
2,over the top and unbelieveable,"Somewhere in this book I lost track of what was going on. The beginning was cool, but it went downhill from there. I can understand that the author was trying to make Jonny some kind of epic hero (which sometimes works well, as in Dune and Star Wars) but here it just did not work. And how did a planet of 10000 humans overthrow an empire of a billion planets. Somewhere it was explained, but I forgot what exactly it was."
1,Look Elsewhere,"The writing in this book is just bad, more like a first novel than a classic. I couldn't get into the plot because the stilted style kept pulling me out of the story. I made it about 50 pages and couldn't stand any more. On to something else."
2,"Good Concept, Very Bad Application",I picked up this book expecting an intelligent sci-fi action novel. I really did try to get through it. I read 700 pages before realizing what this book was. Drivel. The whole thing was written poorly and the characters are so shallow you don't really care what happens in the end.For the patient reader.
5,But What About the *Book*?,"Even allowing for differing tastes, the book isn't *that*bad. Given the vehemence of some of the negative reviews here, I can'thelp but think many of them are colored by the reader's dislike or disagreement with Scientology. This isn't Scientology. Or if it is, Scientology must be some pretty everyday stuff. But what this book *is*, is good old-fashioned, black-and-white, good-versus-evil, rockin' and rollin' adventure and some *very* tongue-in-cheek satire. I loved it; I've read it three times and will most likely read it again. It's not for nothing that Hubbard is acclaimed by the likes of Stephen King, Orson Scott Card, Algis Budrys, Asimov, Heinlein -- people who know a thing or two about good writing.I highly recommend this book. END"
5,Incredible Epic!,"There have been few books that have kept me up, resulting in lost sleep and exhausted days at work. Battlefield Earth was one such book.I kept telling myself, ""Just one more short chapter..."" and I'd look up and discover it was 1AM!Don't buy this book if you have a job that requires you to get up very early in the morning. You will not be able to get to bed on time. It's that good!"
1,Torturous,Publication of this book is evidence of man's inhumanity to man. I haven't read a book so dry that it actually gave me a headache since my old college micro-economics text book. Is all of his stuff this bad?
5,John Travolta,"I just met John Travolta at Border's in Ann Arbor. Cool guy. Excellent book so far having read 43 pages. Powerful. Still 1000 pages to go. But I can tell from the first 43 pages that this is going to be a very adventurous book. I already know that after 43 pages. Not many books can do that. Not many books can give you that sense of thrill after 43 pages, not Grisham's The Firm, not even King's The Shining, and certainly not Pride and Prejudice."
2,Derivations of Perspective,"To label this book as 'most favored novel,' as 2008 presidential hopeful Mitt Romney has, is to disclose the source from which you derive your perception of future possibilities. Any 'most favored book' is such because it stands out in the labeler's mind. The labeler carries the ideas and concepts of the book with them throughout their life, using them to develop a personal perspective. Thus, one must be critical of the sources that another holds in esteem."
1,SCIENTOLOGISTS ARE BAD PEOPLE,SCIENTOLIGISTS WANT TO KILL PEOPLE IN THE END. STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK. HUBBARD IS THE ANTICHRIST
1,Boring,"This book starts off boring, gets a bit interesting in the middle and then; gets boring again.I would not blame anyone for not finishing it!!!!!!"
1,Waste of space & time,"I first read this book in 6th grade, and I remember that even then I found it remarkably shallow and boring. Now, as I look at it again after all these years, I realize that it's actually much, much worse than that. As mentioned in another review, this book would've made a decent comic book or cartoon. But it is NOT good sci-fi, in fact, I don't think it should be classified as sci-fi since that would stink up the whole genre. I tend to classify it as a juvenile scribling which is best left forgotten. L. Ron had some decent stories (as long as you could cope with his worldview), but this is definitely not one of them."
5,Best SciFi story I have ever read.,"Do NOT judge this book or story by the AWFUL movie with Travolta. There is so much more to this book than the movie touched on. I'm not a Hubbard fan, and this book has NOTHING to do with anything Scientology. It's just a huge (1000+ pages) epic story of mans battle to reclaim the earth from aliens. Well written, great characters, excellent story. Even though this was written ages ago, it still stands up very well."
3,One of the best? Not really. But at least give it a try.,"I read this book cover to cover. I don't understand what all the whining is about. I have read ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", ""Starship Troopers"", and all of the Dune series. I have read science fiction novels since I was a little kid, and I am not a Scientologist, but I thought this book was alright. I resent the fact that one reviewer said you'd either have to be stupid or a scientologist to enjoy this. I enjoyed it. It wasn't great, and I don't think I could ever sit through the racial profiling and the stale plot line again, but at least I can say that I read it. If you want to read it just for fun or just because, then you should. If you want to read it to be able to say you read a book that was over a thousand pages long, then read ""Atlas Shrugged"" or some other ""great"" novel that you might be able to get something out of."
3,"Excellent plot, but what happened to the characters?","This book was spectacular reading, but some of the characters were very poorly written. Johnny Goodboy Tyler, while being the main character of the story, was very poorly drawn out. During the time I was reading the novel, I realized that the story was a great concept, but it felt like it was written by a twelve-year old. The writing was just so immature! Characters are supposed to be believable, not laughable!"
3,"Entertaining, but could have been much shorter...","This book was fairly entertaining from the start, but once you hit the half way point it starts to lose you. The author could easily have trimmed out a few hundred pages. Many of the characters were uniteresting, and I found some of the stroylines boring to read through. I also have to agree with some of the other reviews. The style of writing in this book is not up to a very high standard. It is very much geared towards someone in highschool, if that. All in all it was pretty entertaining with a few good plot twists."
2,A 2 Star - which is all Hubbard deserves,"As with most of Hubbards work, this is intended for a very young audience, mostly male, and his development and treatment of characters reflect that. It is truly a saga - from both the writers perspective, and the perseverence it takes to plod through it. I made it through, mainly based on my belief that the recommendations I'd heard were justification enough... but alas, it was many days wasted. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,Ugh....Wanting it to End,"Imagine if you will: a fourteen year old with a word processor, trapped in a basement with nothing else to do. What do you get? Battlefield Earth! You can avidly pinpoint when Hubbard uses Scientology in his writing (i.e. the ""Pychlos""), and all you have to do is look at how he rabidly dislikes modern psychology and psychiatrics. The characters have silly names and are two dimensional. Really, don't waste your time."
5,18 Years in the waiting!,"I first read this book in 1982 and loved it so much I read it twice! I've waited 18 years for the movie to finally come out, and I hope they do the book justice. This is a fast paced book that was ahead of its time back in 1982. When I heard that the movie was finally coming out, I bought the book again to refresh my memory and could not put it down (again). Forget about the Dianetics stuff Hubbard preaches. This book is simply action packed with many little side stories that add to the richness of the plot. My only critique is the quickness (timewise) of the human's learning abilities to handle advanced alien technology, but that could be explained by the use of the learning machines. While over a 1,000 pages, the reading pace is downright fast, and you will want to read it again."
2,Pulp sci-fi. No other way to describe it.,"I had to force myself to read half of this book. I thought it was boring and predictable. It got to the point where I was thinking to myself, this is what this or that character is going to do, say, or think next. What a waste of time reading this pulp fiction. 2 stars is too high, but really, 1 star is too low - give it a star and a half."
1,Stay Away!!!,"I am curious if Hubbard can write about Scientology, because he sure cannot write interesting science fiction. This book is one of the all time worst novels I have ever read. All the characters are boring, the plot (after the first hundred pages) goes nowhere, and the prose is like that of a ten year old having seen Star Wars for the hundreth time. Sometimes you can judge a book by its cover."
5,Watched the movie preview...,"My book is old and falling apart. I read the whole entire book again and it was still great! It covers everything to interplanetry politics. This is my all time favorite book. I will watch the movie, however, if you haven't read the book then watching the movie first would be sacrilege. The book is over 1000 pages long. Obviously a movie can't encompass the original story of the book, unless it is 40+ hours long!"
3,Long,"Battlefield Earth- Wow, was this book long. It was interesting in parts and boring in others. It was way better than the movie and so different that the cover makes absolutely no sense. It follows post apocolyptic hunter/gatherer Johnny ""Good-boy"" Tyler as he opposes psychlon oppression. The second half of the book about the intergalactic bank no longer being solvent was especially relavent. Who would have known. This book could have easily been two and probably should have. It is much too long to really enjoy. Toward the end (last 500 pages or so), I was reading it for the sole purpous of finishing it and moving on to something else."
3,Battelfield Earth,"Battlefeild Earth was a good book. To get to the point quick, it was a little long. However, having never read L. Ron Hubbard before or not knowing much about dyanetics, I thought this book was good. So, what did I like about it. I like the fact that it was about a group of people trying to overthrough their conquerors. It was detailed (though not overly so) and it consisted of some impossible feats. But, this is sci-fi. It is a good story if you are interested in being entertained. Will it change your life. Probably not. I liked the battles and I liked the main character in that he was strong. Albeit too strong. But again this book is just a plain old good story. What didn't I like about the story. The fact that again it is a story about humans killing everyone else. The fact that in every sci-fi book humans overcome everyone that is different gets kind of old."
1,So bad it's mystifying,"Hubbard's self-agrandizing introduction is much more entertaining than the book itself, so do yourself a favor and stop there. Not only is the story flawed, completely unbelievable, and overly simplistic, it's just written badly. Suspension of disbelief is stretched past the breaking point early on, and it only gets worse. Had this book been a 300-pager, it might have worked because the premise is actually quite intriguing. Alas, apparently El-Ron's editors were complete frauds. No editing of any kind was present here -- and it is sorely missed -- so we have a grim tome whose only redeeming quality is never-realized potential. Please don't take that as any type of endorsement. The potential itself is not enough to warrant any effort at reading this book. And believe me, there's considerable effort called for. You actually have to work at finishing this thing. Don't bother. It's just plain bad."
2,Average at best,"The idea behind BE is interesting (Earth after an alien race has taken over), but the presentation is amateurish. All of the characters are completely one dimensional, the leaps of logic are glaring and the book is badly in need of an editor (apparently no one was willing to tell ElRon that he needed to edit this thing down.)BE is a classic example of ""pulp fiction"" (i.e. quickly written, poorly thought out magazine filler) and, from it's length, ElRon apparently thought he was still writing for 1-cent a word.If you want some GOOD SciFi see Asimov, Heinlein or Bradbury, this is far from their level."
3,Scientology here? Couldn't find it,People say this book has scientology in it? I must not have looked hard enough. It is a long book and there are parts that slow and boring. I thought it was an okay book; hence only 3 stars. I thought the movie Phenomenon had more references to Scientology than Battlefield Earth...but we won't talk about the movie version...gag.
1,"Wait for the movie, and then rent the video.","I found this epic to be slow, with few surprises, and not much of a bang at the end. Looking back, I am sorry I spent the time reading through its 1,000 plus pages. Not much of a page turner, although I can see how it might appeal to a young audience. The characters and narration have a very one-dimensional tone--dumbed down for mass circulation--or maybe this is as good as Hubbard gets. Either way, I recommend reading something else. This one's just not worth the trip."
1,"Bad plot, thin characters, dull prose","This book encompasses all the weaknesses of L. Ron's science fiction, and extends them by going over 1000 pages. The plot certainly reminds you that Hubbard made his biggest literary splash in the pulp magazines, and he should have stuck to them. He simply didn't know how to write characters that readers would be interested in for more than ten pages."
5,People are over-examining this book,"This book was not meant to be a ""deep"" sci-fi novel like Asimov's and others. I've read Asimov, Frank Herbert and many other sci-fi greats' work, but this is different. It is more like an epic adventure story than a traditional sci-fi novel. It is to be enjoyed on another level than most other sci-fi. I loved the story and had a hard time putting this book down both times I read it. I have no feelings for or against scientology, so that isn't affecing my review. If you like an exciting story, and want a break from ""traditional"" sci-fi, read this book. If you think you are ""above"" this type of story, fine go find something else. I for one would reccommend it."
5,Man never gives up,This is a great adventure story set in the future. It gives a very real idea what it would be like if we were invaded. Once you start it is very hard to put it down! It kept me up late several nights in a row. You can really identify with the humans. You fight along side with them every step of the way. This is SF in its best form.
3,Read it,"People who give this book one star probably only saw the movie, but they do have valid points. It is a very exciting book that keeps you reading, and that is enough for me, but it does have some weaknesses. The main character seems to be the perfect character without a single flaw. In the intro he says that the book was not edited, and it shows. This book probably could have been better at 900 pages. He does take some scientific liberties, but at our present technology level, who is to say that he is wrong. If you are looking for a science textbook, read one. If you are looking for a fun page-turner, read Battlefield Earth."
1,This book was awful,"I thought this book would be in the same genre as Aliens, boy was I wrong. It was so poorly written I couldn't believe it ever got published. And what is with all of the 5 Star reviews, No way it deserves even 1 star but that was the least I could give."
1,Unbelievably drab,"In the prolog, the author brags about how he was known as one of the publisher's most prolific writers, moving from genre to genre as needed. I've been reading Fantasy and Sci-Fi for over 20 years and this is one of the weakest books I've picked up. The basic premise of the story is sound, but the author drones on and on clearly trying to fill pages. In many books, this is accomplished by building character definition and drawing the reader into a world that is crisp and inviting. However, several times in Battlefield the author drives the story to viable closure and then just restarts again in a new direction to fill more pages. I recommend you save yourself some time and choose a different author."
1,OH MY GOD AWFUL,"Hubbard's self-agrandizing introduction is much more entertaining than the book itself, so do yourself a favor and stop there. Not only is the story flawed, completely unbelievable, and overly simplistic, it's just written badly. Suspension of disbelief is stretched past the breaking point early on, and it only gets worse. Had this book been a 300-page paperback, it might have worked -- although the ridiculously convenient reversal of financial fortunes would have needed some serious revision. Alas, apparently there was no editor involved in the writing process, so we have a grim tome whose only redeeming quality is never-realized potential. Don't bother. It's just plain bad."
1,Not more Hubbard!,"I refused to read L. Ron Hubbard long, long before I ever knew what Scientology was. I stumbled across some claptrap or other with his name on it, said ""Awful"" and went back to Bradbury, Asimov, Vonnegut and Heinlein. I tried to read this tome, I really did, but it was just terrible. Hubbard might have been really innovative in the 30s and 40s, but compared with the greats who have come after, he's nothing special. This particular work was, like everything else with his name on it, an overblown, confused, chaotic mass of STUFF--not one page of which made any sense. I gave it about six chapters and never did get hooked. If you want classic SF, spend your money on one of the great names of the genre. Shut your eyes and pick out a Robert Heinlein book. You will be much better satisfied."
1,"Cool alien stuff, zero substance.","If you like alien stuff, simple plots, long books with lots of action packed testoerone, this is a book for you.If you prefer literature where characters are complex and well developed, and plots that are complex and unpredictable then you will want to pass on this one.This novel was about action, aliens, and one-dimensional characters going on and on in (often ludicrous) conflict after conflict. On this level I was mildly entertained (I did bother to finish the book).I was bored with the characters, especially Johnny Goodboy Tyler. At times I wanted him killed off just to end the misery. I was begging for a plot twist, for some simple element of intelligent story development. I have seen better writing from a ninth grader.This was the first and very last book of Mr. Hubbard's that I will ever read."
5,Great Book,This is a wonderful book. The only problem I've ever had with this story was the fact that it ended. I will be rereading this one several times in coming years.
5,My Favorite Book EVER!!!,"This is the best book I've ever read. The movie was AWFUL, but the book is so much fun to read - I couldn't put it down. I got this book as a teenager and I read it again every ten years or so, and it's still my favorite book EVER!"
5,Non-stop adventure!,"This book was fast-paced and a real page-turner! I'd recommend it to anyone -- science fiction fan or not. It has non-stop action, adventure and suspense!"
4,"Entertaining, but could have used some editing.","This was a good book overall, but I would have definately left out about 150 pages to make it more readable. Also, the fate of some of the characters in the book was rather disappointing and anti-clamactic."
4,It was fun!,"Some people have complained that Battlefield Earth has no artistic merit. True, but if you were looking for a deep, thoughtful book, why would you pick one with aliens and stuff blowing up on the cover? I read it and it was very entertaining. It is better than a lot of other sci-fi/entertainment novels because of its creativity and detail. L. Ron. Hubbard took a worn-out post-invasion story and and made it into an inspiring epic. For a book of its size, it did not drag much and was a good read. I am glad I read it."
1,This book is horrible!,"The text was simplistic and unchallenging. The women in the book (as well as in the film) were weak afterthoughts - their only role was to be rescued. The book droned on for entirely too long. Rather than being a deep sci-fi novel, it was more of a man verses beast story that happened to involve aliens.I was throughly unimpressed and disappointed. Had it been possible, I would have given the book no stars at all."
2,Placement is a pain,"I was excited to see that Jabra had come out with a hads-free device that used a boom microphone, but was disapointed almost instantly. The range of adjustments it provides is encouraging, but I could never get it to fit just right. It was never tight enough on the ear, to keep out the road noise and annoying in the way it kept the mic resting against my cheek, adding noise to the conversation. When I would adjust it one way it would throw it out of adjustment another way, because of the design Get the Jabra hands free adapter that is entirely in the ear, you won't be sorry."
2,"Beware, the ear clip breaks very easily","Having purchased the Earwrap three weeks ago, I was extremely happy with it, especially the clarity of the calls and the noise cancelling technology. The earwrap clip that wraps around your ear, however, would appear to be a chronic problem with this model. Mine broke in half just today. I talked with a friend who purchased the same model and all of his clips have broken on him as well within a few months of purchase, and the unit comes with three. Hopefully they will improve the material used in the clip because, that aside, it's a great handsfree unit...But that doesn't do much good when it ends up in your lap because the clip broke..."
2,"Great Audio, Crappy Earhook","I found this phone to be comfortable and the sound quality is great. The enormous defect of this phone is the earhook. I can get it to conform well to my ear and it doesn't move. However, both earhooks broke very easily after about 4 months total.Now I have a great earphone which isn't hands free, and thus useless."
1,I can&#65533;t get it to stay on my ear.,"I can't get it to stay on my ear. No matter how hard I try to get it to stay, it just won't. The sound seems OK if you hold it on your ear, but what good is it if it isn't hands free.I plan to send it back."
2,BaD,"This earwrap [stinks].. the only good thing about it is that it can stay in your ear if you get the right position and that it looks nice, that about it. i just got around to use it and when i did the other end was like ""is there a fly in your room?"" theres is this buzzing sound that is so annoying to listen to and both ends can hear it. im going out and getting myself another kind/brand.."
3,Decent Ladder,This ladder has decent quality but the wood is not as thick as the Paradise Toys ladders - so not as sturdy and easier to chew through. The hooks are on the smaller side so the ladder can't be hooked everywhere on my medium/large parrot cage. Decent but the Paradise Toys ladders are far superior and worth the extra expense
5,Wonderful wonderful!,I love Kate Delafield! It s not too often when a dectective series starring a woman can hold it's own book after book. Kate's character is fully formed and not at all one dimensional. You see how she struggles to remain tough in what was definetly a ma's job in the 1980's. You also see her struggle with her sexuality and how it affects those around her. Thank you Katherine V. Forrest for a great series.
2,Conflicting and many mistakes,"This is one of the worst textbooks that I have ever used. It was assigned in my class, and I was forced to read many chapters in their entirety. There are numerous grammatical errors also. DO NOT BUY THIS WORTHLESS BOOK!"
1,Worrible book,"This book was a required text for my advanced pharmacology class, and I wish I never had to purchase it. The editors of this book must be non-medical, because the drugs are described throughout several chapter which make reading undesireable."
1,NP Student,"This text is awful. It is very hard to follow and is not nearly as in-depth as it should be. It is poorly organized. For example, if you look up ""ACE Inhibitor"" in the Index, its listed on 39 pages, ranging from p75-1086. Obviously, these are not all in the same chapter. Its mentioned in the chapters entitled: Culture and Ethnic Influences etc, Drugs affecting the cardiovascular and renal systems, Drugs affecting the Hematopoietic system, Drugs affecting the endocrine system, drugs affecting the reproductive system, a chapter about Angina, a chapter about Diabetes, a chapter about heart failure, and a chapter about hyperlipidemia. As you can see, this is just one example of how spread out information is and how it is hard to get a concise view of a drug or method of treatment. I would not recommend this book. I gave it one star because Amazon makes you give it at least one star."
4,Pharmacotherapeutics for Nurse Practitioner Prescribers,"Book as described, timely receipt.I am using this book for a class, have been reading in it for about 3 weeks so far. The introductory chapters are concise and informative; ""Pharmacogenomics"" was all new information for me and was well-presented. It seems quite thorough.Expect to skip around in the body of the book, if you are studying a specific drug or disease. A recent example: antacids, H2 blockers, and proton pump inhibitors are described in chapter 20,""Drugs Affecting the Gastrointestinal System,"" then you go to chapter 34,""Gastroesophageal Reflux and Peptic Ulcer Disease"" to read about them again in disease treatment protocols and patient case study examples. Quite a bit of overlap in information between the two chapters.Overall, I would recommend this book so far..."
2,"Short cord, not durable, in-line volume is problematic","The cord is extremely short--2' tops--so you can't use them unless you're clipping your mp3 player on your arm or right at your waist. And I've only been using them about 2 weeks, and the rubber has already broken where the wire connects to the earclip, leaving the wire exposed. And when you use the in-line volume control, it can make half of the stereo sound drop out. I've seen other headphones with in-line volume control do that, but usually only after months, not right out of the box.On the plus side, it doesn't have that irritating ""cord management"" thing, where one of the ears has a much longer cord than the other, forcing you to either leave your mp3 player on your left side (which makes SO much sense, since so many of us are left-handed) or have the cord cross in front of you. This one lets you pick which side to wear your ipod on."
4,excellent headphones,"Very comfortable, has a volume control on the cord. Sound is great (but I'm no expert) with excellent volume."
2,"No in-line volume control, not very comfortable","Web description said there was an in-line volume control and there wasn't. Also, very uncomfortable when worn for long term, or laying down. I will be trying something else, but I do have to give thanks to Amazon for making the return process SO easy!"
2,Poor quality,"These were fairly comfortable to wear but I was very disappointed with them. The sound quality was poor and within a month, only one side was still working. Don't waste your money on these."
1,Not Happy!,I was very disappointed with this product.The quality was poorly made the sound was much too low.The whole thing was just to flimsy. I am planning on shipping it back and getting some thing else.
2,Irritating,"I used to think this product help me, but having stopped using, my hair improved. Received product quickly and in good shape, but not for me anymore."
1,IT DOES NOT WORK,"I did use this product as indicated on the box and like every other young man that is losing his hair I am willing to spend any type of money to keep my hair, but his product is definitely not the solution. It just doesn't do anything for your hair the only result I obtained was less money in my pocket and a very dry scalp. Don't waste your money; you are going to regret it."
1,Smells SOOOO Bad!,"This stuff smells SOOOO bad that I only used it once. Honestly, I can see someone who is single, and lives alone using this, because anyone within 10 feet of you will be able to smell it. I will never use it again."
4,"Nice, but doesn't fit 2-5/16""","Description says it fits a 2-5/16"" hitch ball. It doesn't. I cut the ridges inside and was able to get it on. I don't know if it will survive very many on/off cycles, but it was a novelty gift, so, whatever... I like it."
2,Duck Hitch Ball Cover,Liked the duck but didn't like the fact that it doesn't fit what it is supposed to. Smaller opening that was specified. Returned.
2,There's Only....4,"The subtitle (A Collection of New Football Writing) might lead some to thing this is a book of short stories like"" A Book of Two Halves"", but it isn't. What Hornby has assembled is a collection of 13 essays by writers (including himself) about their favorite season following a soccer team. Unfortunately, many of the essays are boring as hell to this American reader, with names of unknown players streaming by meaninglessly by and all manner of pop culture-specific references drifting past. Roddy Doyle's (The Woman Who Walked Into Doors) essay on Ireland's 1990 World Cup run is nice, as are Don Watson's piece on Leeds United '74/'75 and Giles Smith's piece on Chelsea '73/'74, both of which feature the authors as children. And of course Horbny's own piece on the futility of following Cambridge United in '83/'84 is entertaining as one might expect."
4,great book,"george smith is a lot like donleavy's other protagonists in that he seems to have the outer trappings of refinement and composure while actively unravelling from the inside out.the book, for the most part, is entertaining, though donleavy does tend to dip into his flights of self-indulgent fancy a bit too often for my taste. still, donleavy has his chops and manages to make things funny along the way.""the lady who liked clean restrooms"" is much better--and, of course, ""the ginger man."" this new one ""sunrise on moonville"" reminds me of a leaner, snappier donleavy as well. it's a good read, too."
2,Latest batch not as good,"These were excellent in previous orders - soft, chewy, with just a dusting of the white rice flour coating. But the ones I received in my last order were smaller, harder, and have a thick white coating on them. You have to soak them in water before they are edible."
4,Lovely!,"I picked up this camera after reading through all the reviews on this site and I must say I am very plesantly surprised with it. It has great color and the zoom is just fabulous. It's a little big and somewhat clunky for someone with small hands like mine, but nothing you can't get used to. As for the proprietary cards, I've found that all the complaints are really moot. The cards are only about [money] more than other ""standard"" name brand cards, and worth it for the picture quality. Bottom line, if you're looking for a good camera that takes nice, sharp pictures for a good price, this is it. If you're looking for a professional camera, be prepared to pay professional prices. But this will certainly do very well for anyone who just wants to take nice pictures."
5,great camera,"This camera combines 3 qualities you will not find in any other camera:great pictures, low price, and unsurpassed ergonomics.It can be operated easily with one hand; it slips easily into a breast pocket; it is laid out in a rational way.There are times indoors when there is not enough light for non-flash photography with this cam, but that is true of most cams.I would not own any other camera."
4,Good camera for the price.,I am over all impressed with this camera. It does decent distant shots and decent close up shots. I have had a few lighting problems but rarely.
2,Pictures are good but LCD is horrible,"I have got this camera after reading several reviews. I liked the simplicity of using AA batteries & the price. The camera size is good as does the flash. The biggest complaint I have about this camera is the viewing on LCD screen. Once the pictures are taken, I can see them clearly on the LCD, but viewing through the LCD in light to medium lighting conditions is next to impossible. It is too dark. I don't know if I got a defective model, I don't have the patience to follow-up with fuji. Since this is one of the main features I look for in a digital camera, I am returing it."
4,"Weak Flash, otherwise very good",If not for the weak flash this camera would be a 5 star camera. Pictures are too dark when shooting at night. Everything that is further than a couple of feet is almost invisible. Great camera for the daylight use.
1,Was nice WHILE it worked!,"Well, mine went belly up (after less than a year) while I was in Hawaii! Now there's a trip you can't run back and enjoy too often! All of a sudden, out of the blue, the screen went white with a line through it! Can't take pictures, can't review pictures, can't see pictures, can't see options, can't see nor do nuttin'! Dead!! I thought at first that it was just another one of those things that seem to happen to me when I try to purchase something everyone else likes. Not true! I read several reviews on here where people had this SAME exact problem; white screen with line through it. I'm just out a camera and had to finish my Hawaiian vacation with a disposable camera! Don't think I'll be buying ANY new digital cameras in the near future. I'll stick with the disposable cameras from the drugstore! Well, now that I think of it, I guess my FUJI 2650 is DISPOSABLE camera, too, isn't it??? Grrrrrrrrrr"
4,Used Fujifilm finepix 2650 camera,"I owned a new Fujifilm 2650 and after 4 - 5 years and probably 8 - 10 drops, the display quit working, so I purchased another ""portable"" camera along with an expensive, not so portable one.My inexpensive ""portable"" camera is good and corrects lighting, exposure, etc.This camera, the 2650, takes very good natural pics. It's not real complex and doesn't try to ""correct"" the lighting, exposure or whatever.What you see is what you get in the photo.I found this used 2650 for $25 and figured, what do I have to lose.It arrived on time, well packaged and it works just fine. It's somewhat obvious that it is a used camera. Physically, not in as good condition as my old one, but it takes very good 4mp pics."
5,Fuji FinePix 2650 2MP,This is the greatest little digital camera. It is so easy to use; I could use it right after the salesperson showed me how. It takes really excellent pictures. You do not need a camera with higher pixels to get a good picture. The 2.0 Mega Pixels is just fine. I have reccommended this camera over and over. You will not go wrong on buying this and the $$ is good. Enjoy
1,hard to use,"this camera in itself is a fine one but when it comes to uploading the pictures it caused a great deal of problems. Once I installed the software I wasn't able to log onto the internet to send pictures, I had to save all pictures to disc then restore my computer to its original state. I would not recomend this camera to anyone."
1,Save your money,"Don't bother. This camera is not worth the price. I bought this as my first digital camera, and was very dissapointed. While the picture quality was fairly good, the viewing angle/width is hardly satisfactory. I bought mine at a store, and promptly returned if for a refund."
3,It's a Shame I can't get the supplier to send to Canada,"I live in Australia, my sister lives in BC Canada, I tried to purchase this camera for her christmas and the supplier wont ship to her address. Really top Service NOT>"
2,Not great,I have had 4 of these for business and they break. The lenses usually fail over time. Inexpensive and good pictures but it won't last. Be prepared to replace it soon.
4,Good Camera for the Money,"Being someone who just takes pictures for fun, I wanted a digital camera that was little bit more than a point-and-click. This camera offered that. The menu is easy to use and for an amateur, it is very easy to get accustomed to. The pictures come out pretty well. The only thing I wish I had on it would be a stronger zoom but for what it does offer, it's not bad. Uploading the photos from the camera to the computer is very easy also. Again, this camera is great for someone who is looking for digital technology but is not exactly the most camera savvy person."
3,The impatient one again,"Oh, and I forgot to add: The time it takes after each picture is so frustrating!! After I've taken a picture, people always ask me if batteries died. grgg! sO IF YOU ARE AS IMPATIENT WITH TECHNOLOGY as I am, spend a few extra $$ (or get your parents to) on a camera that has light speed recoveries and zooms. Otherwise it will seem like you are manually rewinding a camera. (like you do with disposables or pro 35mms)I give this 3 stars mainly because I like the pictures I took. They came out great."
5,"fun, cheap, and easy","This is way easier and more fun than I expected. I was able to get started taking pictures as soon as the camera arrived, and despite being a techno-weinie I've been able to download pictures effortlessly to both my old home computer with windows 98 and my new office computer with windows xp. I use an slr film camera with an array of lenses, and I won't stop using that for serious photography. But this camera is fun, instantly gratifying, takes amazingly good pictures, and all at a great price."
1,Great... until it completely stops working,"I've had this product for just about two years. It's pictures have always been pretty good and it was very easy to use. I brought it with me on a trip a couple of weeks ago, and when I turned it on, the LCD screen just had a couple of grey lines going across it. After an exhaustive search for solutions to this problem (including phone conversations with the helpline, email inquiries, and a thorough internet search,) I have pretty much determined that it is unfixable (unless I want to pay $90 to have fuji fix it... but wait, can't I buy a new one for that price? oh yeah, so that doesn't make much sense, does it?)I would not recommend this product."
5,I highly recommend this camera!!!,"Great pics, excellent features, user friendly and [doesn't cost a lot]. I knew nothing about using a digital camera and I was taking pics in a matter of minutes after taking the camera out of the box. I had no problem getting the pics from the cam to the computer. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the pics. I couldn't be more pleased with this camera. I really like having the option of the optical zoom. The movie setting is a nice bonus and I've made some great short clips of the kids in action. My only recommendation is to buy some rechargable batteries because once you get this camera you will be taking pics of everything and everyone. :)"
3,good camera for the price,"This camera is good for what you pay for. My main gripes are that the LCD screen isn't as crisp as some that I've seen, and that it takes forever to recharge after each shot. I'm sure lithium batteries would work better than the NiMH batteries that I'm using, but that would get to be too expensive. Also, the picture quality isn't the greatest. All in all, it's defintely a good buy if those shortcomings are ok with you."
5,THIS CAMERA REALLY ROCKS,I got this fuji finepix 2650 a week ago.The camera takes very good pictures.Also it come with a great price.
2,Didn't work right,"I thought this would be a good starter phone for my nephew, but when I put batteries in it and tried to take a picture, the screen would go blank. I had to turn it at an angle in order to take the picture. It would've been a great camera, had it worked correctly."
5,The Greatest Camera for It's Price!!!!,I bought this as my first digital camera last Christmas. It was so easy to use and set up. The picture quality is great. It was recently stolen and I'm going to buy another one just like it. I would recommend this camera to anyone who doesn't like to read directions.
1,OK for a kew months but...,"I bought this product from best buy because their price was better than amazons, but i would not recomend this product to anyone! For the first month i owned it it worked wonderfully, buy after a while the LCD screen just went blue and lined went all over it. It was a big waist of my 179.99. Technical suport was awful and would not process the warenty b/c the registration had been lost (not my fault- theirs). Bust buy wouldnt do anything because i paid for it by a giftcard. I do not recomend the best buy store to anyone. I bought a Nikon 3100 (or 3500 cant remember- camera not with me) I enjoy it and have had no problems with it, and the software bundle was excellent."
4,Look at Results with this Cam!,"Hello,I am 14 years old and spent all my money on this camera and bought the FinePix 2600Z. I purchased this camera around July and am very pleased with the results. The only part I am dissapointed with is the PRICE$$$. This camera has had a $100 price drop in a few months! And I really bought this camera on a tight budget and researched for weeks for the best deal, makes one very angry. I have taken a few thousand pictures with this camera ..."
4,"Great, Inexpensive Digital Camera","I had been shopping for a digital camera for a long time. I came across the Fuji Finepix 2650 and saw how great a bargain it was. It has a 3x Optical Zoom, 2 megapixels, and is light and compact. The pictures it takes are excellent quality. I can't tell the difference between those pictures and pictures taken by a regular film camera. If you want to print pictures that are 11 x 14 or larger you might want to consider a 3 or 4 megapixel camera, but for 8 x 10 and smaller this camera does just fine. If you are looking for a great buy on a great digital camera, this is it."
1,worse than ever,Hello.I searched a bit to take this product.Unfortunately i am not in US so a relative bought it for me.After working perfect for 2 months no i cannot USE the LCD monitor.I tried to contact the FUJIFILM by email or by phone to Romania and Greece but nothing.In Romania they have no authorised service dep. and in Greece the Dep. [stinks].What to say better next time be more carefull.
1,The Gift that never was,"I purchased this item as a Christmas gift and never received it. The seller claims he sent it, but the item never got to the birthday person leaving me in an embarrassing situation."
2,Christmas Gift,"I have an Olympus camera with many of the same specs as this one. I bought this for my daughter, and we are a little disappointed. It uses only 2 AA batteries instead of 4 in my other camera, and pictures we took with it at night outside are very dark. My pictures turned out fine... For that reason, I wouldn't recommend buying this camera. I'd say spend a little more and go with Olympus."
1,i'm glad it's discontinued,Got it as a gift for my birthday less than a year ago...had a problem with the lcd screen in january sent it to fuji took about 2 months to get it back from the service department. Worked again for about a month then the usb cable got screwed up and my computer couldn't read the camera b/c the camera's input port was messed up so i bought another one at walmart and took the original one that already had had 2 defects back to walmart in it's place. The button on the one from walmart now turns around past the point where it is supposed to be to take pictures and it is impossible to take pictures with it at all...DO NOT BUY this camera!!!
1,FUJI Christmas Gift for my son,"Purchased for my son for christmas, he loved it, now camera isn;t working properly,view screen messed up,need help,warranty? where take to get fixed? pls call me 8026588864.Thanks"
2,LCD Viewer Screen Poor Quality,"I'm returning this camera. The LCD screen is just horrible. I had to adjust it to the highest brightness to be able to see indoor and sunset photos, and readjust the brightness to view the pictures taken. When I found the great shots I was looking for on the previewer, I'd go home and download shots that would come out much darker than expected. I'd use the software to lighten the shot, but the quality of the shot would go downhill.In my opinion, I should be able to see what the shot's going to REALLY look like, so I know I've got the right one, before going back to the computer.Also, not so sure 2MP is enough for me. Just a small amount of cropping also degraded the quality of the shots taken."
3,Plus others!,"I would recommend this book, but only if it is read along with others in the field; such as ""Leading Change"" by Kotter, and ""Strategic Organizational Change"" by Beitler."
3,Change?,"I don't understand why this book is classified as a ""Strategic Change"" or ""Organizational Change"" book. It is neither.But, it is a good book, if you enjoy reading the work of a futurist.For ""Org Change"" take a look at Kotter, Collins, Beitler, Black & Gregersen, etc."
5,"Good book, plus...","This is a good book. In addition, I recommend ""Strategic Organizational Change"" by Michael Beitler."
2,Political biases get in the way,"Interesting speculation of potential future events. Some are way out such as the prediction of a major asteroid hit. Others are likely, such as his note that nuclear energy will likely return in response to global warming fears. What spoiled it for me was his calling the US a ""rogue superpower"". He clearly understands we were attacked on 9/11 and notes that Al Qaeda is a ""rogue enemy"", but does not believe we have the right to protect ourselves by taking the war overseas to our enemy. His first book, ""Art of the Long View"" was more informative."
2,dissapointed,"im a huge armymen fan love the franchise but the package is horrible. when you open it they all fall out. pc for this game is very difficult to play cuz of the controls .ill stick with the console version, plus only ones i loved in this package is sarges heroes and world war. along with the first armymen game. most of the other ones look soo terrible so old looking. it would be nice for a new company to bring this franchise back from the dead."
5,games,I bought this for my grandson. He loved it. Easy to install. Easy to play. A good buy. It make a great birthday gift
5,great deal,i love the army men series and this set is a great deal 7 great army men games for 30$ great deal the set includes army men 1 army men 2 army men toys in space army men air attack army men sarges heroes 1 army men air tactics army men world war great deal these are all great games but the graphics are dated but who cares about graphics these are great games and they are all classics every army men fan must have these games warning these games will not work on windows vista/7 xp and lower is reccomended
1,Bummed.,"I used Norton 8.0 and later upgraded via LiveUpdate to 8.0.1 in order to make Norton compatible with Panther. Oof. What a disaster. Speed Disk did nothing to speed up my computer. I had several MAJOR disk problems over the course of the past 3 months, and Norton did not fix them. Norton fixed a TON of dates that it said needed to be fixed, for icon purposes, but that's it! Most recently, after waiting for my computer to boot for 15 minutes (stuck on the dreaded spinning disk at startup) after running Norton, I scrapped the entire plan, reinstalled Panther and YAY my computer works nicely now. Before spending the money, try using Disk Utility on your OSX disks...or reinstall your system which you already paid good money for. I think it can only work better then this."
1,Poor choice of textbook,"I chose this book as the text for an undergraduate mathematics seminar, thinking that the studentswould like something very elementary. Unfortunately, the book's presentation isn't simply pedestrian---it is completely muddled. Many elementary points are presented via circular arguments which simply left the students baffled and confused. It is a real pity to see an elegant subject like general relativity butcheredso thoroughly. In retrospect, it would have been far better to first have them read Rindler's ESSENTIALRELATIVITY, and then give them selected excerpts from the elementary track of GRAVITATION by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler."
2,Adequate,"This book is adequate at best. The best thing about it is that it is short. It really leaves out all the physical reasoning behind general relativity and gives the equations necessary to do computations. If this is what you want, then this is definately the book for you. Better books are ""A Short Course in General relativity"" or more advanced books like Wald's General Relativity, Misner-Thorne-Wheeler ""Gravitation"", and several others. Just remember, being able to do mindless calculations (which Mathematica and Maple can do nowadays) is not the same as understanding the material."
1,Useless,"The second edition of this book (which is what this is) is a terrible change for the worse. The first edition tried to introduce (the mathematics of) general relativity, in the ""geodesics"" method - i.e., taking the shortest route possible between two points, teaching you the mathematics and basic physical postulates and nothing more. But while the first edition used modern differential geometry, this volume has been entirely re-written in coordinates!!! This means you'll be given the old definition of a tensor as a set of numbers that transform as ... and thus taking away the book's only merit, being a modern, quick, short introduction to the mathematics of GR. Sorry, but even if I wanted a sea of indices (which I don't and no one else should) I could have picked up Weinberg's book. Try Schutz's book on general relativity instead."
4,A great introduction to color's role in storytelling,"This book is definitely on the beginners side of the spectrum. (no pun intended) You're not going to learn to be a production designer just from reading it, but it's a great start to becoming more aware of the use of color in film (or comics, video games or any other visual media) to influence underlying mood of the story. And once you're aware of color's presence, you can start making educated choices on how to use color in your own work.Although a few more pictures would've been nice, the author does a good job of taking each of the six primary & secondary colors and defining its role in general and then giving numerous specific examples of the different visual and emotional tones each color can take.If nothing else, this book added about 8 movies to my Netflix queue."
4,Decent,"I liked this book very much except for one thing that I believe could be better. I believe jessica COULD have succeded in getting devon if she was only a bit smarter. The problem, I believe, is that jessica relies too much on the obvious manipulation tricks such as smiling. If she were truly skilled she would have used subtle tecniques to get around the mental block that devon set up in his mind to stop jessica from getting him. She would have had a much higher chance of success that way. I believe she should study the real tricks of manipulation."
5,"If you loved Charmed, you'l love this book",The best chapter in this book is 'what would have happened if Prue were still alive'.
3,OK book,"This is an OK book for being reviewed, young Charmed lovers would not sit to read I don't believe. If I had seen inner details, I would have left it behind.It is just critique about the show from different people and their different views on it, I didn't finish yet, so, I gave it to my daughter to read then she wanted the movies to watch to know what it was talking about. The friend's teenage daughter looked at it for about 3 minutes then put it down."
3,Nights in the Gardens of Maine,"This is not a review, but a request. Would you be able to track down which one of these Maine 'themed' CD/tapes of Paul Sullivan includes readings from Joel White (wooden boatbuilder and son of E.B. White) on it.Many thanks -Elizabeth Atwood"
5,So much fun,"I would highly recommend Brooke's DVDs to anyone trying to learn line dancing. I also have volumes 1 & 2 as well and really enjoy her teaching style, she's easy to listen to and follow along with. The lessons are very user friendly and I was able to catch on very quickly to the steps. This DVD has a lot of the line dances that are popular at the bars that do line dancing and 3 dances that are not included on her other DVDs. My husband and I have really enjoyed it."
2,Speaker/audio outputs NOT present as advertised,"The speaker and auxiliary audio outputs are that are advertised on both Amazon and in Crosley's print catalogue for this item are not on the actual product. When I contacted Crosley about this issue, they admitted to the error in their advertising and eventually (after multiple phone calls and e-mails) exchanged it for the Oak-colored model, which does have the outputs.I am happy with my new Oak CR73 model- good sound, nice classic look. I wouldn't recommend the cherry version (though I prefer the color) unless you don't care about the audio/speaker outputs."
3,"Cool toy, lame stands","Ratatouille toys are a rare find, so we were happy to get it. However, the stands are small and the figures dont stay on them well-which isnt TOO big of a deal when you are actually playing with them. It would have been nice if they could stand on their own. Other than that, we loved that we were able to have a toy that represented so many characters from one of my 3 year olds favorite movies!"
1,Back pack failure,The Stansport dog back pack was tested on a short hike prior to an extensive multi-mile trek which included two medium sized dogs. In both cases the stiching-to-pack harness failed and was necessary for a seamstress to reattach.
1,Not Reliable,"Received the Stansport Saddle Bag for Dogs and placed one regular bottle of water in each pocket. Light jog around the neighborhood and when we got back to the house, it was ripped open. Nothing more to say really, it lasted less than 24 hours."
1,Junk,This item was not worth 25 cents! I put it on my dog and went on a hike. The piece of junk fell apart within 30 minutes of use. It developed holes and my keys and other small items that I had put inside of it fell out onto the ground.
1,"great seller, poor quality merchandise","We put the saddle bags on our dog for the first time, and within an hour, one of the bags had ripped through. We returned the item and received a prompt reimbursement. I would say the seller is fair, but maybe stay away from this item."
3,Not very high quality.,"I bought this bag for my German Shepherd to give her something to do while hiking and it worked for a couple hikes and then...it fell apart. I don't know if that's the regular for this product or it was a defect, but I can say she was very happy while it lasted. I'm not buying this same brand anyway."
1,Poor quality,The basic design is good but the quality is very poor. The straps came loose from the right bag during the first use.
3,"Great product, but broke after 1 week","The saddle bags were a good fit and seemed comfortable on our young husky. It certainly worked in wearing her out more quickly too. We used them on her every day and after a week or two, the strap under her stomach broke. I'm not sure if we can repair it, but I didn't expect it to break that quickly!"
3,I want to love it,"This fits my two dogs well - I have a boxer-pitbull and a Great Dane-Australian Shepherd mix. The adjustable straps work well, the saddle bag capacity is generous, and it sits in a good place on the dogs' backs. However - the belly strap doesn't have a way to tuck away the excess strap. And, unfortunately, the loop on the back for the leash broke with one hard tug from my pooch.So, I will use it. And replace the metal ring. And cut off the excess strap. The other features are nice, the padding is super-nice... and I will continue to use it."
2,Good after I fixed it...,"The actual bag tore the second time I used it. Once I sewed it back, it works fine. I was just frustrated to have to repair it myself for it to be useful."
4,"Good quality, Good price",Was shipped very fast. Was what I expected. The straps ate a little long and I need to cut them but that is just because my dog is probably on the small end of the range this can be used for. No complaints.
4,good pack,"I am pleased with this pack however its a little big for my dog, but thats not a defect in the product. The pack is adjustable fitting a wide range of sizes. my dog is comfortable in it however because i have it adjusted to the smallest size, there is a lot of strap hanging down unused."
3,Might not be safe around water,"I bought this so my dog could help me carry things to our boat. Then I thought ""What if he falls in, loaded?"" For that reason I haven't used this item. It fits well, and might be OK if only loaded with things that float on their own, like an empty water bottle. But that doesn't reduce the weight that I have to carry."
3,Primer on WWI origins,"The Origins and Legacies of World War I - D.F. FlemingThis long out-of-print book, published in 1968, is a classic primer for serious students of European political and military history leading up to WWI. Dr. Fleming was an Emeritus Professor of International Relations at Vanderbilt University. He gears this book for history majors and readers with a deep and thorough knowledge of the convoluted politics, military rivalries and intertwining royal relations of the era.This reader found the discussion of President Wilson's inability to overcome Republican opposition to US membership in the League of Nations very informative. This was another example of the long history of isolationist sentiment that permeated US society for many years.To be honest general reader may find Barbara Tuchman's ""The Proud Tower: A Portrait of the World Before the War, 1890-1914' and ""The Guns of August"" more accessable and easier to comprehend."
4,Can be made to Last a Little Longer,This cologne is not too strong or too weak. Smells like a perfect blend of stuff. This smell is something you can get use to smelling without being over powered. It has a Soft and smooth smell. Good for any occasion. The only down side of this cologne is the half life. Most of the smell is gone in about 4-6 hours. Not too much problem. Who wants to smell the same all day anyways? Lol. So this is perfect for parties and nights out. It draws compliments before it fades away into thin air.
4,Perry Ellis 18,Perry Ellis 18 was thee first ever cologne for Perry Ellis that i have ever used........and it is very good.
5,Smells great!,I had wanted to buy this for a long time after I got a chance to sample it at a big named store. I was not however ready to pay thier big store prices so I was very happy to see this at such a great price and Amazon. It's a real good sized bottle too and smells very fresh clean.
5,"Fantastic arrangements: gorgeous chords, not hard to play","A good collection of songs, but what makes this collection really shine are the arrangements. Non-standard, gorgeous chord sequences, rhythmic interest, but still reasonably easy to play. And fun to sing along with.My favorite songbook for sight-reading practice."
3,Treasury of Great Show Tunes,"The seller was great, the book arrived timely and in excellent condition.I was a little disappointed in the contents within the book, but that was my fault; not that of the seller. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this seller to a friend."
2,Reader's Digest Treasury of Great Show Tunes,"The first item did not come to me, but a second one was sent quickly. However, the item did not look brand new as I had expected. I'm not sure if it was due to insufficient packaging for mailing, damage in store or was slightly used. I specifically asked in an email to Rainbow Deals that it be boxed. Bubbly wrap envelopes are not sufficient protection for mailing because items are easily crushed and stressed, especially ring bound ones like this. I am not happy about having to incur postage to send it back. Have re-ordered it directly from Amazon.com hoping for better results."
1,Dont Buy,"It lasted ONE DAY, it rain and the whole thing came down ... you get what you pay for... it was not sturdy at all... everything you don't want a gazebo to be"
2,Definitely collapsible,"Canopy collapsed, broke and ripped after a rain shower. Very disappointed with the product. Very attractive looking but not durable."
4,A Pretty Good Book.,Saturnalia is a good book. It has a good style by smoothly switching from character to character. It also has some other good parts in it. It also has some bad parts in it like the beginning of the book is really boring and didn't make that much sense.The book is about a little Indian boy named William. He lives with the Curries and is an apprentice. There was a lot of other characters like Malcolm who is very entertaining because he was trying to get all the ladies but keeps getting rejected and refuses to believe it.So over all I think the book was pretty good after you get past the rocky beginning.
2,HILO,"The book Saturnalia is a gripping tale of a Narraganset Indian boy who, by day, is a printer's apprentice but by night he is a 13-year-old boy looking for his brother. There are also many different characters in this novel and each one has their own part in the book. One of my favorite characters is Malcolm the wig-maker's servant who thinks every girl is in his reach and that his poop doesn't stink. Now I'm really 14 but my teacher thought it best that we, my class and I, used the child thingy for privacy reasons. So if you are 10-15 you would like this book."
2,Book Revew on Saturnalia,Saturnalia is a great mystery book that takes place in colonial times. In this book the author stabs at humor but sometimes the jokes are corny. Some of theme other people have to explain to me. The book is a short book but if you like mystery books than this is the book for you. Some one is watching William the main character in the book. Can you find out who is watching him before the end of the book? Read it and find out.
2,"OK, but kind of dull","Saturnalia is ok but it was kind of dull. I found my self-falling asleep in most parts, but the only parts I liked was when Malcolm got shut out from all the girls he liked. But mostly, I was bored through the whole book. I don't see how people can read it, but if you like books that have absolutely no action in it then I think you should read it. Why I didn't like it was just the style and how they lived."
3,Not Bad,"This book has many qualities for a good book but has a few bad ones. The way he wrote this book is amazing. How he shifts perspectives from character to character and the way he makes them sound like they actually lived in colonial times is something I've never seen in most books. But he does use difficult vocabulary and long sentences, usually what a reader avoids in a book. The characters are colorful and seem real though. One character in this book known as Malcom will make you laugh at every twist and turn.To me the plot is the most important part of a book and his plot doesn't have much action but has at least three different sides to the story.The theme is really interesting by making you think about how it would be to be torn between two different cultures in the colonial times.I would definitely recommened this book to those who have a big vocabulary and of those who love to read books."
1,Sturnalia,"I rated this book a 1 star because realy it's kind of boring. this story takes place in colonial times. Some of the characters are realy hard to understand like Malcom he tries to get all of the girls he can exept all of the girls turn him down, but he keeps trying anywys. In my oppinion the best part of this book is the characters and the worst part is the moral.If you do read thids book im telling you that it will take a long time to read, but overall it is an ok book for older people."
4,Saturnalia,"Saturnalia is a interesting fiction novel about a young Naragansset aprentice named William, who was captured in the King Philip's War.This story talks about colonial times and how William wanted his freedom to know more about his past.What I liked about this story is that its characters are really instersting, I really felt like in colonial times.I would really recommend this book to kids who want to know more about the Colonial times."
3,pretty good book,"Saturnalia is a pretty good book but the characters were not well detailed and did not come to life. The plot was not very clear and was kind of scrambled. Some good points though were that the transitions were smooth and (some of) the characters were interesting. William, the main character, is caught between his Narraganset past and his life with the Curries. Not to mention Mr. Baggot, the tithingman, who wants to catch him breaking the law. One of my favorite parts was Mr. Hogwood trying to win Madam Phipps heart and Malcolm unintentionally ruining all Mr. Hogwood's attempts at wining her heart."
2,Saturnalia,"This book was very unentertainig and short. It had many more cons than pros and it had me practicaly sleeping. Anyways, Saturnalia is a book about a Narraganset boy named William that had his tribe killed by the colonists and was enslaved by Mr. Currie who is very nice to William. So William looks for his lost brother hoping he is alive. Mr. Baggot is the tithingman who despises William because his grandchildren were killed by Indians. If this sounds interesting to you, then you should read it."
3,Funny moments make it worth while,"For a class project we read the story Saturnalia, which is about a young Narraganset boy whose name is William and many crazy characters and how they all survive the crazy colonial times. If I had to rate this book I would have to give it a three because some parts of the story would put you to sleep like when learning about the Curries and their many many children, but there are parts that will keep you on your seat like when Malcolm tried to talk to the servant girl and got covered in the fillings from the chamber pot."
2,Just Plan Boring,Saturnalia is an extreamly BORING book because it doesn't get you into the story. There is no point of reading the book unless a teacher forces you and gives you no choice. The only interesting thing about the story are the characters. some of the characters are very funny.
3,very boring,I found this book extremly boring. The plot was very bad because it took place in the colonial times and it was not descriptive enough. The style of the book and its characters are its greatest strength becuase it jumped to characters very well and descriped them very well. The theme is too confusing to find and I felt I learned too much about the Narraganset tribe and didn't learn enough about William's life with the English.
4,Saturnalia,"Saturnalia takes place in an Colonial town of Boston. There a Narraganset boy lives with an Englishman and his family. He has lived with the English for a very long time, 6 years. Then he suddenly finds his great uncle and begins to learn the way of his native culture. He is tied between his past life and his present life. I like the way it switches the point of view between the characters. I really enjoyed reading this book."
1,MOST BORING BOOK EVER,"Saturnalia is just plain out boring through all of the books I read. I would recommend Saturnalia to no one because it is just boring. I just wanted to throw it into a fire because it was so dull. The reason I didn't like it is because I thought the author could of explained the characters better and it was just not detailed. The plot was stupid and the theme was dumb and the style, setting were just really bad. I repeat never read this book to you or anyone else."
2,saturnalia is a bore,"I thought it was really boring.I shouldnt of paid as much attenion as I did,which wasnt that much in the first place but basiclally i thought it was extreamliey boring.I recomend this book to people who like boring books."
3,Colonial Times,"Saturnalia is a good short book for older readers. Younger readers would not know what some of the words mean(old English)and would find it hard to understand. What i liked about the book though is that it tells about how one person, William who is about 14, must decide between two cultures, Indain and English. He came to the English culture from being captured in a war and was sent to work as a printer in the town of Boston. The story takes place in the colonial times. Overall i think Saturnalia was a good book and recomend it to older or more mature readers."
3,A good book for teenagers,I recommend this book to teenagers who want to learn more about history and colonist times. There is comedy in the book like Malcom is a ladies man in some parts I could imagine it playing out like a movie.There are lots of different personalities in this book such as kind people but there was a couple rude people who would whip their servants and give them only a piece of bread a day.I would recommend that you read this book by yourself and read it in a short period of time because the book only has 111 pages so you should be done with the book within7-14 days because after that you will lose interest in the book and become bored with it. So it is a very good.
5,A wonderful book,Saturnalia is a rare find. The author writes for young adultsbut his appeal is beyond any category. His books arefilled with beautifully-drawn characters and lots of surprises.
2,Amazingly Boring,"We had to read this book in class, and every one was strugglingto stay awake. I guess you might find this interesting if you had thechance to read it on your own time, but when it is drawn out for twomonths, it is the most boring thing in the world. It was confusing when the characters veiwpoints swiched, so much that it was hard to know who was narrating the story. Don't read this unless you have to."
2,This was an okay book.....,"Saturnalia wasnt really the type of book i would want to read unless I had to.This year as a class we read Saturnalia.This book is about a apprentice boy named William. The characters in this book we're very discriptive but for the others like plot and style,well i thought it was very slow moving and to dull. Saturnalia was pretty boring in the beggining but when it got to the end where they were trying to figure out all the problems it got to okay. This book is a book where you have to read it in one day to make it interesting because if you stop in one part and another and another it would get very dull and plain.I think all the book SAturnalia needs is a little bit more adventure and a bit more style to make the book come alive with excitement and adventure."
3,Saturnalia,"Saturnalia~~> It's a good mystery book,for instance like when a mystery man follows William around. I think I would like the book more if I could understand it though, for instance there was to many (1600) words i guess you could say. The book was about a boy named William who was taken away from everything he new and loved, like his family and culture. He goes and lives as a servant with this caring family. He mets up with on of his relatives...who?...will he leave and go live with them...? If you are a good reader and like books with mystery and hummor you would like saturnalia."
2,It had some funny parts but mostly it was boring,"Saturnalia has some good qualities, but also some bad. It is kind of slow moving, so sometimes it gets boring. There is one character, Malcolm, who makes the book a lot better than it would be without him. There are a lot of funny parts with him in it. He was my favorite character. There is a lot of good imformation on colonial time stuff,so if you are looking for a book to read about social studies, then this is a good book, but I wouldn't recommend it for fun reading."
4,"""Ok"" book",It was a little slow at some parts but the wimsical and possible comedy made up for it. The words were well-chosen and the plots kept you glued to the book. The paragraphs were very vivid and easily imaginable. Overall I would recomend this book to kids over the age of 12 and someone who would be willing to drink coffe to stay awake in some parts of the book.
3,Lacking Interest!,Saturnalia is a book that was supposed to be based on a young man named William. Mainly it was about him but there were a lot of characters that had nothing to do with the actual story/plot. The characters may not have been a part of the actual story but they tended to be very interesting. The conflict was confusing and spread out which made it dull sometimes. William was trying to find his family who was separated when the English massacred their village. Read the book and find out what happens. It is a short book.
1,I'm the only one - who found this dull,"Rachel Lee was unknown to me when I picked up this book at the used book store. The book seemed interesting at first but after 50 pages it seemed to wander and become dull. At 100 pages I put it down to read another book. I came back later and read half the book. I was unable to finish, it seemed like words on a page without purpose. Did I really care who was killing people and leaving their bodies to ""melt?"" I then read the Amazon reviews and everyone else liked it. i guess this book is just not for me."
1,Avoid it all cost!,"This is most certainly the worst trash marketed to young children one could find. Poorly written story of a ""vampire rabbit"" that is totally inappropriate for the targeted audience."
3,"Badly editied and organized, but is a must-have","This is one of the very few, if not the only book on IBM's VisualAge Smalltalk. It covers much of the v4 product, but is badly edited with errors in both the text and in the code. Its organization is also confusing, forcing the reader to swap back and forth among the chapters. Still, being about the only source of information on this fine Smalltalk system, this book deserves a place in the bookshelf of every developer using VisualAge Smalltalk. If it just were better written and organized, it would have earned four stars."
2,Disappointed.,I regret this purchase because the hat's brim was not cut or shaped well in its construction. I won't return it; I may take it apart to see where the problem lies and correct it since I'm pretty good in sewing.
5,Finest tea in the land! (more than just in Scot-land!),"This is an excellent, robust black tea to which I switched when I decided to give up coffee a few years back. It has a deep, rich flavor. When a little 2% milk and spoon of Bradshaw's creamed honey are added, it is a delight. Two cups every morning and I'm good to go for the day!"
4,highly recommended,"This is very good tea. I steep mine for 2 minutes and drink w/o milk or sugar, and by then it warms the soul; if you were to steep it for 3 to 5 minutes, one would need a knife to cut it. Nevertheless, the Taylors of Harrogate English Breakfast Gold -- not regular, Gold -- is still the one to beat in the Taylors UK breakfast tea collection in my opinion. Why not try both?! (p.s. I have no financial ties to any tea brand; I'm just a tea enthusiast.)"
3,Taylors of Harrogate Scottish Breakfast Tea,"I liked this tea okay but it's not a favorite. I drink a lot of hot tea and like to have a variety available, but I don't believe I'll buy this one again. Why didn't I like it? Not sure, just didn't care for the taste."
5,Superior taste,"I fell in love with T of H years ago and it remains my favorite brand. Although I am not a tea connoisseur, I have tried many different brands and flavors of black tea and always seem to come back to this one."
3,"Strong and beautiful red, but little flavor","I was intending to purchase Harrisons & Crosfield's Scottish tea, but couldn't find it anywhere, so I settled for this Taylors of Harrogate Scottish Breakfast tea. I don't know if I got a ""bad batch"", but though it was rich, red, and strong, beautiful in color, I honestly didn't taste much of the tea flavor for some reason, actually almost no taste at all. I found that the Harrisons & Crosfield's has a better scottish tea flavor to it, however I can't find it anywhere. Our local store has been out of Harrisons & Crosfields for quite some time."
3,"The snake, the tiger, the crane","Good movie. Love the old school visual effects... Much better than the new stuff out now. Good action, great fight scenes."
4,Works as expected!,"I bought this product as a cheap way to transport my kayak to local waterways. The only problem I had with it was that you have to be careful about getting debris underneath the foam pads as it could easily scratch your paint. But, if you don't really care about that then this is the perfect solution. After using it a couple times I find it pretty quick for getting the kayak on and off the roof. One thing you have to watch is the straps - if the straps outside the car are straight, flat and tight they will vibrate quite loudly even at mediocre speeds. To prevent this, just add a single twist in the strap and you won't hear anything."
5,"Great Watch, Great Price","I bought my Eco Drive from the Friday Sale page, and really love it! I've always been a fan of these Citizen watches, and this is no exception. I like the leather band too, which is very easy to resize."
3,Thanks for the good book,"This book has given me a good background & examples.It is devided as 3 parts (export, import, appendix), but the contents for export & import are almost same, I mean too much repeating.Anyway what a good book!!Today I have ordered other books related export & import, so we will see."
5,A COMPELLING BOOK ABOUT NATIVE AMERICAN HISTORY,"Once I started reading this book on my way to work while riding the bus, I couldn't wait until I could ride the bus home, so I could pick it up again. Ms Shuler does a fantastic job with detailed description of Native American culture and artifacts,an exciting plot line,and very interesting characters. There is love, pain, joy, faith, terror, friendship, paranoia, sadness, hope, disappointment and passion in this book, showing us that the Native American people in the 12th century experienced all the emotions that we still experience today. One of the best books I have ever read!"
4,Very good book; minor flaws.,"I liked this book. It is quite readable and has useful tables. Plus, it is a bargain compared to other neuropathology books. Unfortunately, the pictures are in B&W which makes the microscopic slides look a little bland and confusing. When you are told about the ""red neuron,"" you want to see one that is actually RED!Some improvements that would make this book great:- color pictures- review questions- CD-ROM of pictures and/or questions"
2,Not great.,"No color pictures, patchy clinical relevance and weak chapter sub headings make this a very marginal product. Try this instead.Escourolle and Poirier's Manual of Basic Neuropathology"
3,Aladdin was better,"Lion King is an ok Game Gear Game, That you can beat in about 1hour. It has some nice jumpNrun levels that don't last long enough. It is one of three good Disney movie games,Aladdin and Jungle Book being the others. Aladdin is the best one because it is original and doesn't follow the Genesis version. Lion King is a direct clone of the genesis one and is a little fun. I'd give 3 stars"
2,Not a good purchase anymore,"First of all let me start by saying this computer just can't keep up anymore, you'll find yourself struggling to play videos on certain websites and doing any video work takes forever, if you try to export a ten minute video in HD with this computer it will take anywhere from 3 to 6 hours. This computer uses a lot of electricity (600 watts) your electric bill will go through the roof!! And the noise this machine makes is unbearable. If you do anything like open a program or watch a youtube video the fans will rev up to full speed because the computer uses so much power and generates so much heat!! Any intel mac is faster than this. Also this is powerpc, powerpc is not supported for anything anymore, there are no programs that will run on this computer. This was a good computer back in 2004, but it's just not a good purchase for 2011."
3,I don't like these sorts of books but that is just me,"What we have here is a reporter that is surveying what many scientist and engineers are planning for a spaceship to the closest stars based on current technology.If your interested in this subject, don't want any mathematics or diagrams and don't want to get much into theory but have the reassurance that this is at least theoretical real and not fiction then this book is for you."
2,THE SLEEVE DIDN'T COME,"I've recently bought the whole set of the cowboy bebop series which i couldnt get complete until now but big dissapointement the 2 dvd didnt have the sleve that the other 5 had. I dont know why, but anyway, the series look much better and sounds better...a total 10% excellente!!!!! adios amigos"
3,"Great Songs,Great vouce awfull production as a product.",Looks and feels like a home made cdbad choices of remixes nothing specialJust for really great fans of Taylor tgat you want to have in your collections all her cd releases
4,SHE CAN SING!!!!!,"Taylor can and always could sing, fantastically by the way!!! BUT she still should be making major label records and she should've had more albums while she was signed with Arista. Of course there was stupid favoritism and some poor marketing over there BUT this is the type of singer you would want to build a large back catalogue with. I still expect her to come out with a newer slamming uptempo dance/pop/r&B CD; other than the one that is currently out!!!"
3,Where is it?,"After having seen Doyle BramhallII's Great Wall show on PPV, I ordered this and the Alamo segment of the Wonders of the World series. After a number of delays, I got an e-mail saying this isn't available. And recently I've seen the Alamo show won't be available untill Jan. 1, 2010. Anybody know what's up with the availability of these shows? I gave it 3 stars because I LOVED Bramhall's show, which was the whole of his portion of the Great Wall show."
4,Buying today after checking it out of the library repeatedly,My son is mildly autistic and has a very vivid imagination. He not only works his way through the maze but makes up adventures involving all the little pictures.
4,Excellent book to start eVB & ADOCE,"This is a great book if you want to start programming eVB and ADOCE. The book walks you through a complete ""Pocket Access"" Database Manager that you will be able to complete at the end of the book. You will learn everything that is required to create and manage databases, menus, SQL, etc. I gave it just 4 stars because it cover the basics, which is good, but doesn't go deeper in detail. The reading is easy and makes you want to read more. Now that eVB is not supported in the new operating systems (Pocket PC 2003, Win CE .NET) you should go for his other book using Microsoft Server CE."
1,Rip-off book exploiting a hot topic,Othe 250 pages of this book there may be 30 pages of actual content about doing database programming with eVB. The rest is padding built with incredibly drawn out tutorials on basic SQL.
4,Very Intriguing Read. Colorful and Mystic,"I recommend reading Mystic Dreamers. It's rare, different and quite colorful. The characters are wonderful to bond with. Very entertaining, sexy and of course strong, powerful and protective of his woman. What's better than that?"
2,"Same old romance, albeit in authentic Lakota garb","I just read this book and am truly baffled by the praises heaped on its author. This is the first book I've read by Bittner and, although I enjoy a good historical romance as well as anyone else, I thought this one was truly dreadful. I give it two stars only in recognition of what seems to be historical authenticity - the details of Lakota life were what kept me reading.But apart from the author's obvious respect for the culture she writes about, the plot is predictable, the characters are shallow, the mixing of gory realism and spun-sugar fantasy is just weird, and the writing, though better than a lot of what gets into print, is too often downright amateurish. Maybe some of this will be corrected in the final edition (I read a reviewer's copy).I'm sorry, but this book just doesn't doesn't make the cut. Bittner can tell a story, all right, but let's be honest about what this is - a very humdrum romantic fantasy dressed up in authentic period detail"
1,This book is a poor man's Hanta Yo,"A very poor knock off of Hanta Yo. Flat, one sided points of view(Whites are EVIL and the kind loving Indians are misunderstood) and a predictable storyline."
4,Liquid Gold,"I love my CatGenie, it does exactly what it is supposed to do and makes dealing with litter a thing of the past. This solution is needed to keep everything clean and sanitized, since you don't have to buy litter, this stuff is used to wash the granules and make everything smell good. It works 99% of the time. (Sometimes you get some small poop fragments that are left behind and get cooked under the dryer and you get the worst smell you ever have smelled in your life... ) but it doesn't happen too often."
4,must have item,"Works well, however, you have no alternative but buy this product. You must have it our your cat genie will not work. How about working on a way to refill this product as you can printer ink cartridges. I am thinking about coming up with a method of doing this. So why not save me the headaches and you do it. I'll buy it. I am sure that someone will do this in the near future. Take my word for it. In these tough times some one will beat you to the punch if you are not quick about it. Don't think I am the only one thinking about this!Linda in Louisiana"
2,Get the unscented cartridges instead...,"I've had the CatGenie for 3 months now, and I love it.The Good:-Really well made-Good instructions-Easy to install-Reliable-Well designedThe Bad:-Sanitizer is REALLY strong smelling. To the point where my wife hates it. We have it in our laundry room and now before we run it we have to 1). Open the laundry room window 2). remove any laundry / clothes from the room 3). close the laundry room door, otherwise the smell pervades the whole house and is nauseating.-I just ordered some ""unscented"" cartridges (from http://www.robotshop.ca but they're also available from www.catgenie.com. I'm hoping that will solve the smell problem.So, if you're thinking of buying these cartridges, I would highly recommend getting the unscented ones instead..."
3,Cat Litter Box,"I loved this litter box and the liquid until the box stopped working. I have not had it a year and it was expensive, so I guess I'll have to stick to scoop out litter. I wouldn't recommend it because it didn't last."
2,Too much work to keep it working,"We have 6 cats & bought 3 cat genies. We were so tired of scooping! The cats hated them. We tried for over a year. 2 of the cats never would use them. The cat genies always had something wrong with them. They would get stopped up, the processors would go out, we had to replace sensors and internal stuff almost every month. Finally the only way we could keep them running without a lot of breakdowns, was to scoop the poop and sprinkle some Oxyclean on the pellets on the 1st rinse part of the cycle to clean the pee. We still had to sit with them to make sure nothing stopped in mid cycle and left it full of warm stinky water. We are giving them away, donating them. We have gone back to scoopable litter & no peeing outside of the box. Only a $1000 plus experiment that failed."
1,Still Chewing,"I have used this spray and my puppy still goes back and chews. I really wanted this spray to work, but it doesn't seem to do much."
3,Nothing to Write Home About,"Having enjoyed Gino Vannelli for so many years, I figured this brother of his must be really good. I got a plain, nothing special soundtrack. It's nice but not worth more than 3 stars."
3,Some Great Garage Marred by Inclusion of Psych Crap,"This series has been pretty good for the most part, though nothing approaching the greatness of ""Back From the Grave"" and the better volumes of ""Teenage Shutdown"". This is worth getting for the Unrelated Segments and Tidal Wave tracks, but caveat emptor, a bad third of this volume is psych crap, which never belongs on a Garage comp in my opinion."
2,"Good, but not complete","Not total coverage of odds. I found ""Texas Hold'em Odds"" by Catalin Barboianu superior on math and better organized."
1,Emperor's Tomb should be in a Tomb,"The Graphics are excellent. However there is one very severe flaw with the PC version, you CANNOT save a game. The program automatically saves as you finish a level. If you die close to the end of a level, you have to start that level all over again. If you want to go mow the lawn and resume later, you have to start that level all over again. This could be, no IS very tedious and I've already lost interest in the game. The packaging indicates no special playing exceptions, so I assumed it would be like The Infernal Machine... A potentially very exciting game, that ends up disappointing."
5,save glitch solution FOUND,"Okay, I have just figured out how to save! When you click on the NEW GAME option DO NOT put your name in. Just leave INDY1. otherwise {even if you go through the whole game it will never SAVE}.By leaving INDY1, when you play the game, every time you pass a ""loading"" point, it will save.And if you don't want INDY1 to be your save... get ready to play the WHOLE ENTIRE GAME IN ONE STRETCH {really we don't know how long it will take us to finish it}"
1,WARNING!,If you are thinking of buying this game MAKE SURE YOU READ THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS! This game is very picky about requirements and will end up being a complete waste of your money if you have slightly out of date hardware. So check before you buy!
1,IT DIDN'T WORK ON MY COMPUTER,"I COULDN'T INSTALL THE GAME ON MY COMPUTER. I COULDN'T GET IT TO INSTALL WITHOUT DIRECTX AND MY COMPUTER KEPT BLOCKING THAT SO I GAVE THE GAME TO MY GRANDSON AND HE PUT IT ON HIS COMPUTER. AND HE IS REALLY ENJOYING IT. THERE SHOULD BE A BETTER WAY TO TELL WHAT THE GAMES NEED SYSTEM WISE TO PLAY. I USE WINDOWS XP, DUAL-CORE, PENTIUM COMPUTER. OTHER THAN THIS, I WAS TREATED VERY WELL."
1,You'll be sorry!!,"This has to be the worst game that Lucas Arts has ever released. The movement controls are the worst I've ever experienced in any game. Paired with the endless fighting scenes that are hard to control, you'll want to tear your hair out. You have to go through seemingly endless screens just to load, save, or quit.But the worst thing is that there's no quicksave mode, so if you die near the end of a particularly stupid level, you have to go back and start the whole level again. Endless frustration.The last Indiana Jones game, ""The Infernal Machine"" was superb, one of my favorite games of all time! It was highly playable, with wonderful puzzles and great controls. ""Emperor's Tomb"" is as close to the exact opposite as you could get."
2,No strafe controls? What were they thinking.,"I'll add my voice to others here pointing out the bad controls for this game. Specifically the lack of sideways movement makes navigating near walls confusing if not downright dizzying. Stopping the character puts the camera into automatic ""freelook"" mode allowing you to pan the view all around Indy. The problem is that when you resume action, the camera and Mr. Jones are reconciled in nauseating, Blair Witch style flurry of camera movement.On behalf of every gamer I know I'd like to send the following message to game developers: QUIT SCREWING WITH THE GAME CONTROLS. We're sick of it! Potentially good games are being destroyed by these ""creative"" control systems. Indiana Jones is just one more victim."
1,Disappointing,I was so looking forward to this game. Unfortunately it was not what I had hoped for. I would not recommend it for true gamers.
4,Stop the Whining....excellent game!!,"I can't believe the whiners on here. The controls are no where near as bad as reviews on here would have you think. Those that are whining need to make use of a really cool little invention called..a JOYSTICK!! or a game pad as I have used so far. Obviously those who are complaining about the controls haven't played any true 3rd person games as most of them operate this way, ie..Tomb Raider series etc. This game is absolutely breathtaking! Superior graphics, a spell binding story line, and an excellent sound track along with fantastic voice overs. I believe Harrison Ford did the voice for this game even if it doesn't indicate he did so. I'll eat my fedora if it isn't his voice! I gave the game the 4 stars out of 5 simply for the lack of an in game save feature, which I find extremely annoying at times. But this game is well worth the money and I truly hope there is a sequel on the way. Excellent job LucasArts!"
2,Poor movement control--AND YOU CAN'T SAVE GAMES!,"What a terrible disappointment. I've begun playing the PC Version of Indy and the Emperor's Tomb, but the keyboard control of his movement is very clumsy. With high quality engines like the Quake architecture available, there's no excuse for such aggravating movement problems.But the worst thing is that the game does not allow you to save games! After working through a long series of actions, should you slip and ""die,"" you have to go back to the beginning of the level, where the game may have saved a start point. You then have to work repeatedly through the same portions you have played, just to get back to a simple action point.Miss a jump? Too bad, you have to crawl through a series of very difficult steps, fighting the lousy control engine, just to get back to try a single action.How could they screw up such a great game so badly.A very disappointed Indy fan...."
2,A Dissapointing game for Indy,"When i heard about the release of this game i was very excited and anticipated a great game. I finally got the game and when i played it, my first impression was the graphics. They are terrible! Even in cut sequences they are rubbish and are just the same as in the gameplay graphics. People who say that the graphics are good are just biast and really do not understannd anything about graphic quality."
2,Lucas Arts Should Fix Problems Before Selling Anymore,"The character's motion is horrible. This makes it difficult to positioin and complete tasks properly, causing a mistake that takes you back to the beginning of the same frustrating trip you just took. Can't save at all (then why do they give you ten spots to ""save"" in?) I do not have the amount of time this grueling game needs. I WANT to play this game without these frustrations because it could be a great game. It has wonderful scenery and smart obstacles and the plot is great. I hope they'll fix these issues, because it's now shelved and I have lost {money}. It almost seems that it was pushed out in a hurry without being complete, just to make a deadline. I so want to play it! Lucas Arts should make good on their product. I'll keep looking for the fix!"
2,Whipped into submission,"The game is quite fun actually and the graphics are terrific. My problem with it is that there is entirely too much dependence on Indy's whip to get around. In some cases getting to the object I needed took so much effort that it just wasn't worth it. Also, the inability to save at crucial parts is non existant, the player is forced to go all the way back to the beginning of the chapter to try whatever he was doing again. I never finished the game. I gave up after several hours because it just wasn't very much fun."
5,Well organized,"It is a good text, well organized. It brreaks down very complicated information and makes it easier to grasp."
4,Lessons our two year-old enjoys,"I remember the Berenstain bears fondly from my childhood. The books are entertaining with nice illustrations, bright colors and the always interesting...talking bears. They introduce life lessons without being overly preachy about. Our two year-old remembers the lessons and we use them regularly to remind him when he slips up. He is just figuring out how to lie (""mommy didn't give me vitamin yet""). He understands when we compare what he says to the book he knows so well. We've got a bunch of these books and we plan to get all of them!"
5,Great stories that teach little kids about issues that really relate to them,"The Berenstainbears has long been one of my favorite books to read to my children because they love it, and because it teaches them lessons about things they will actually deal with in real life. Also, very cute and lovable, the Berenstainbears is a great series for your child to read."
4,Not Bad for the Money,"Length:: 3:39 MinsBought this camera to use for my model railroad; I mounted it on a train car and pushed around the layout. For this the camera worked fairly well, I mean for under $30 what kind of image quality do you think it's going to have? This same camera is sold on the web for $85 to $100 on sites that sell model railroad or R.C. hobby supplies, so the best thing is the price. I've posted a using this camera and receiver, as they say, ""one video is worth a thousand words""."
1,Don't Buy,"I bought 2 of them, and none of them worked. Dont waste your money ,its a waste of time, and money you get for what you pay for."
3,Ok if you have to have a purple robe.....,"I really wanted a purple robe, so I looked around and found this one. It's of average quality and finish, but nothing to get excited about......."
1,not for Fox bassoons,"I ordered this case as a replacement for a school instrument. It did not fit at all, not even close! My daughter thinks the designer has never even seen a bassoon! It's a real shame because I like the canvas outer shell and the zip pocket on the side, but you can't use this for a bassoon. There's no protection for the whisper key and no allowance for the ring for the seat strap."
4,Edgewater Return,"Although I found edgewater's first album, south of sideways, to be very boring and uninspired, my curious nature got the best of me and I had to hear We're Not Robots. The first thing I noticed was that everything seemed more focused. All the songs had a very formulaic structure, which certainly isn't a bad thing in rock music. Where South Of Sideways struggled to keep the listeners attention, We're Not Robots makes up for ten-fold, with urgent vocals and big sing-a-long chorus'. A year ago I would have told you that Edgewater were a boring and immature group of musicians, but after listening to We're Not Robots, I've changed my mind.Some people have compared the style on Robots to that of an early Linkin Park. I say, what's wrong with that? Linkin Park have put out some of the most solid records in the rock music world. In any case, though, it'd be hard to draw much comparison to Linkin Park, aside from some well placed digital tracks and dreamy chorus'. Recommended."
1,Edgewaters new album,"The first song is GREAT, but after that the album just doesNOT compare to the first one. Sorry I bought it. Too much SCREAMING for me."
1,Not History but all about a Vendetta,"Sadly, books like this one by Piszkiewicz are considered by many to be historically accurate. Piszkiewicz is not a historian and his attempt to hide behind psuedo-historical wording still cannot hide his obvious bias against von Braun. I wrote my MA thesis on von Braun and his Team and these men were not Nazis. Von Braun gets labeled (Neufeld for one) as an opportunist, like that is a bad thing. If I had to choose between the USSR and the USA, darn right I would go with the Americans. Thankfully, von Braun and his team did come to America and were the foundation of our booster program that led to the incredible Saturn V which landed Americans on the moon. Von Braun is a great American Hero, warts and all. There are numerous books out there much better than this shallow attempt at character assassination."
2,Wernher Von Braun: The man who sold the moon,the author had a hidden agenda when he wrote this book of linking Von Braun to Nazi atrocities. That agenda clouded his ability to write a clear perspective of Von Braun's career. He brings in other historians with a similar bent and refers to their opinions when making his points. Combine with the author's poor writing style and you find a throughly unreadable biography. The only saving grace is a few bits of information that if surfaced on the US space program not found in other books.
1,A New History? About our Space Hero?,The book is not a good biography of Wernher von Braun. The autor made a highly emotional attempt to prove that von Braun was a war criminal. Don't waste your precious money!
1,The inmigrant,"A brilliant and perfect analysis of the American period in the life of this very clever, organized,tough and ""protected"" man. The title suits perfectly the contents.It is a pity the author does not cover in some detail the first six months of 1.945 in the life of this person, this would have provided a more complete analysis of the biography of this German manager (more than engineer)and a better understanding of those aspects of his American biography not yet clearly explained.In any case it is a perfect analysis of the character.If this analysis be extrapolated to the German period of his life it would be easy to anticipate his authentic biography. A pragmatic and egocentric character. A potentially dangerous man.A very good book"
2,Not a fair bio..,"The author of this book had (as a previous reviewer stated) a hidden agenda, I think, in writing this book...Mr. uh, Piszkiewicz (?), obviously doesn't like Mr. von Braun, and was out to paint him in a bad light. Proof of this lies in the last line of the book.... ""Sadly, because of his complicity with the Nazi cause, he also sold his soul to reach that goal.""A fairer portrait is deserved..."
4,A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR,"Sir: In the book ""The Day After Roswell"" Werner Von Braun made the statement that there was a lot more to UFO's/aliens than what had been published. What did he/Third Reich/other scientists know about UFO's/aliens that has never been published. Are there books out there on this subject which are written in a scholarly way?"
5,The Perfect Fix,"I was over the moon when I spotted this on Amazon! Though not the most intelligent of scripts, Growing Painds: The Return of the Seavers is warm, engaging, and most of all, it's just great to to see the entire ensemble on the screen again. The perfect fix to fill the empty spot they left when the series got cancelled. I just hope they now come out with the season 3 DVDs as I've watched season 1 and 2 so much, I practically know every episode word for word."
5,WIll always be my fave show,"Growing Pains was, is and will always be my favorite show on TV. So watching this movie just brings back a lot of pleasant memories, having grown up with The Seavers. Warner Bros, when will you release Season 3 (and all the other Seasons too, for that matter!)? We're still waiting!"
1,BORING!,"David Wilhite is a bore. This tape is a sedative. If you know ANYTHING about the game of craps, you probably won't learn much more from this tape. Better to buy a good book on it AND play a computer game to hone your skills before going to the casino with your real money. Speaking of real money, don't waste it on this tape!"
4,Extremely Useful.,"I recommend this book be used with the Russian vocabulary cards by Vis-ed. Since words are listed in order of frequency of usage, you can look up the first 100, dig out those words from the set of flash cards, then move on to the next 100, etc. After the first 1000 words, you'll need to write your own cards, but Vis-ed sells blank ones too.A useful tool, but not the screaming bargain that the author's Russian course is, this is more for the serious student."
2,Less enthusiastic,"I am less enthusiastic about this book than the precedent reviewer. I hoped to receive a book with a vocabulary, which is not in alphabetical order (because it is difficult to learn from alphabetical lists). Unfortunately, a large part in this book is just in such an order. Together with the high price and the bad condition the book arrived (it looked like a second-hand book, for the price of 150 USD), I was disappointed and a little faché."
3,Considering these weren't great KISS tunes to start...,"There is some talent here, but overall just another KISS tribute record. Taken from an era of KISS fillers, this disc is, in the very least, unique. All of that said, there are some cool versions of otherwise lackluster material. The screaming version of ""Tears Are Falling"" is really good and a bit funny at that. Also of note is a funk-d-fied version of ""Dance All Over Your Face"". Definitely not a must own, but not bad."
3,Buyer beware.,Make sure you know that this set is only hard anodized on the outside. It has a non-stick coating that can be scratched. The pans are sturdy and are good for cooking on the go. Just make sure you dont use metal utensils. Im giving 3 stars because they dont tell you in the title what type these pans are. A lie by omission is still a lie.
4,Haven't Used it,"Love the anodized finish, handles look sturdy enough, really small but that's what we wanted for our truck camper. Great for 2 people!"
3,Smaller Than They Appear,"I can't speak for anyone else, but I was expecting a larger set. These seem too small to cook for more than one person. I think I'm going to have to invest in yet another set for my ""group"" camping trips. They pack up nicely, but not quite what I was expecting."
2,"Poor Quality, Way Overpriced","I purchased my Texsport Black Ice ""Scouter"" cook set hoping for the best after reading numerous positive Amazon reviews.Either people are too incompetent to accurately judge the quality of items these days, or else they are lying to make themselves feel better for making the mistake of purchasing such a shoddy item. One or the other, and maybe it's both in some cases.I paid $20 including shipping for my Black Ice Scouter cook set. That is all it is worth at best.Everything about the pots, pans, lids and handles are cheap and poorly made.Cheap cheap cheap. Made in China cheap.I am so glad I am only out a twenty spot on these emabarasingly poorly made pots and pans.If you are looking for a good, non-stick, anodized set of cookware for camping, hiking, and/or backpacking - purchase something else. Buy another brand. Texsport is pathetic."
1,Unhappy,"Rec'd subj cook set in Amazon package which included other purchase. Amazon box was in perfect condition. Wish we could report same on cook set. Made of light weight aluminum w/non-stick gray coating, the cook set arrived dented/bent. We decided to retain set since option to contact seller 'Amazon' was not available. Given it's camping cookware, we should presume future accidental dents, dropping of pots...usual wear & tear from usage anyway. Just disappointed only option re condition was to return & hope replacement set would be in perfect condition-great unknown...."
5,More than we expected,"My husband and I were preparing for a 3 night backpacking trip, interior camping via canoe. It was our first time so we researched the different items that would be necessary as well as light weight. We were pleasantly surprised wiht this mess kit that we had purchased. We used it not only on our protable stove but also right on the camp fire. It held up perfectly and it truly is non stick and durable. I would definitely recommend this for any backpacking trip."
5,Really quite good!,"Worked well over gas grill and stove. Lids are excellent, and clean-up is quite easy. Use wood or non-stick utensils to they don't scratch!Certainly recommend."
4,compact and light,"If need need be, one can make do with just 1 pan and be well off. Handles move around a lot so be warned."
4,Very good compact cook set,"Very well made, can withstand torture, and packs up in a very small bag. Bring yourself a few rubber bands to hold to handles together when extended and you will be good to go."
5,Great little pot set,"I needed a small set of pots to go camping with--that did not take up a lot of room. This set is it since there is just my hubby and me. The pans nest inside and are stored in a mesh bag. All about as big as a large coffee can--little bit bigger in width. There is plenty of room to boil things or make soup or whatever. Very, very light too. And while they are light, they seem very sturdy and well made. I like the fact they are with lids too. I do wish the handles had some sort of clip on them to keep them together--now I will have to figure out something metal that I can use to clip them, don't want to use wire as that would be a pain. Any ideas?"
3,"Solid design, but just a little too small","The lid doesn't fit on the smaller pot when I put my propane tank inside. It's also pretty heavy, compared to most backpacking kitchen sets. That being said, I can still fit my camp stove and silverware inside. Easy to clean and use. Bring rubber bands, or something, to keep the handles from folding back onto the pots."
3,A little small,"It seems like it is built well, but the handles could be longer and it is only for two people at most. But if you are looking for something like this, then it is a great buy."
5,Great Product and Arrived Fast,This is a nice little cook set for the price and quality. It is sturdy and packs up small. Not for your ascent to Mt. Everest but good for regular hiking. It arrived fast and I recommend this kit.
4,"Good pots, handles get hot!","These pots are what I expected, they fit together well and make them easy to pack away and are easy to clean. But the handles are cheap and get very hot very fast and will burn you, use a cloth or pot holder if you plan on picking them up at all."
2,"A CUTE LITTLE STORY, BUT THAT'S IT","As an employee of Reynolds & Reynolds, I was anxious to read this book. It was given to myself and all of the other employees and I enthusiastically opened the cover, hoping to be filled with inspiration and admiration. I got neither.Freewheeling tells the story of Richard Grant Jr., a man who was born into a wealthy family, was uncertain about his future, but succeeded anyway because of his last name. What I thought would be an inspiring ""rags to riches"" success story turns out instead to be a biography of a guy with little direction who had a love for cars and boats. Richard's father, Grant Sr., appears to be the real inspiration in the family. It would be interesting to read a book about his life and his ascension to success and fame.Grant readily admits that his last name helped him. Working for a nepotism- crazed company like I do, I know exactly what he means."
2,not what they used to be,"This seat cover is 'installed' by means of elastic loops - no longer the shoestring type tie-downs. I have a VERY standard F-150 from the late 80's - this thing fits on okay, but would not stay on no matter what. I tried several ways to install, short of sewing on some actual ties. Every time I get in, or get out or move in the cab, the back slips off. I've had several of the older style covers in the past - they last a long time and I almost never had to adjust them. Why did they have to change something that worked so well? I'll be returning it."
1,NOT 60/40 SPLIT COVER,"Had to return 2 of these because I received STANDARD BENCH covers,not split back...The product description is wrong."
4,Rustic Furniture Fantastic!,Beautiful book full of twiggy rustic furniture. Anyone who loves cabins and decorating and hickory furniture will surely love this book full of ideas galore from making ones own furniture to buying.
4,rustic furniture book,"very well illustrated, great value, must have if you are planning on making your on furniture"
5,Excellent!,"A great breakdown of events leading up to Ft. Sumter, and a great analysis of the early relationship between Lincoln and his cabinet, esp. Secretary of state Seward (who at this early date mistakenly thought Lincoln was a puppet he could manipulate). All in all a fascinating read and a must for good civil war libraries."
5,You'll want to see them perform live!,"You definitely will not regret buying this one! Although the ""live energy"" obviously cannot be fully captured on a CD, you will definitely keep this one in your player for months wishing you were able to see them perform for you (if they haven't already). The energy-charged songs make me want to sing out and get up and dance. This is undeniably one of my favorite CD's...a really great collection of powerful songs."
5,Best Reggaeton Album. Ever.,"This is the precursor to what today is called ""Reggaeton"". Just listen to it and you will see.. this album is 10 years old or so and the beats/rhythm still sound fresh. So much so, I came here (amazon) today to buy it, after searching through my music collection and not finding it. Best of the best, period."
2,"Nice look, disappointing quality","These briefs look great out of the package and look nice on. After several washings, the waistband started to slightly fray and the fabric was fading. I wouldn't choose these again for the price!"
4,A good reference for beginners,"This book is excellent for any beginning aquarist. It has great sections on setting up aquariums, fish health, and feeding. The plant section is a little brief, but in all this is a very complete guide to starting your own aquarium."
3,I thought that this book was avearge,"I have been keeping fish for about four years now. I have done a lot of reading on the internet, and think that the net is a better refernce than this book. This book was just average. Having checked out a number of books from the library, I thought that it was a little bit thin in most areas. There were not that many types of fish described, and many commonly available fish were not covered at all.It is however, the only book that I have seen which describes how to take pictures of an aquarium (about 4 pages)."
4,"Good value, lot's of useful info!","This book is excellent value. It has plenty of information on setting up a new tank, fish health, photography, filters and other gizmo's, etc."
3,"Good, but dated and redundant","Dick Mills writes pretty good aquarium books. However, he's written the same book four or five times. Getting any one of his books (I'd suggest ""The Tropical Aquarium"") means you've read them all.Also, this book was published in 1986, and is quite out of date. The understanding of the nitrogen cycle in this book is very primative. Get a more recent book."
5,A must have!,"This is the most comprehensive book I have ever owned on aquariums. I had a 110 gallon salt water tank for years & this book answered all of my many questions, with beautiful color pictures. I would highly recommend this book, as it was to me several years ago!"
4,BUY THIS BOOK NOW!,"I am a very new member of this hobby, and I would be absolutely lost without this book. I refer to it at least twice a day. The species guide is excellent, the best I have found so far, though I would like to see more species included. Detailed and easy to understand. Absolutely indispensible. If you are a beginner, you must read it. I went from knowing almost nothing to being a confident, knowledgable fishkeeper after reading this book. It is more than worth the money."
1,Waste of money,"I didn't want an ipod because I think it looks boring and when I saw the archos gmini xs 100 I thought it looked fun. Unfortunately, it's crashed twice and this time the hard drive has completely stopped working. Tech support takes forever to respond. I've since learned that many people have similiar problems with Archos. Do yourself a favor and just buy the ipod."
3,Nice R&B!,"Live365.com had this artist in their music library for a few months in 2004. But, it wasn't until his publicist dropped me a note about his new CD that I garnered interest in it. Upon listening, I noticed his voice is smooth, very much like R&B vocalist, R. Kelly, not overpowering and not too annoying. ""Crush"" was clearly the signature track on the CD. I was keen on its high quality arrangement. Other highlights were the tracks, ""Giving Upon Love"" & ""I Can't Believe"". I also enjoyed the remixes on the tail end of the recording. The remix track, ""Be Mine"" I thought was better than the vocal version. There were a few shortcomings. The liner notes could have used a more professional CD cover as it seemed amateurish. (The Amazon.com website has an updated liner note cover as displayed above. The CD I received was different.) But overall, it's not a bad CD from the Chicago native. Recommended!"
5,Best tasting powder in the world!,"This stuff tastes so good I can't believe it. I have purchased about 5 different chocolate whey supplements. None have tasted this good! It mixes very well with water, and it also contains nitric oxide enhancers, arginine, creatine and glutamine. This is well worth the price and it is delicious!"
1,horrible,This stuff tastes so bad i hold my breath while I guzzle it... my roomate had it and ive been taking it. I feel like the reviewers above are fake advertisers for the company especially after looking at their reviews.
2,Disappointment,"I just got the book today and I have to say that I am extremely disappointed. 85% of the book's content can be found free online.I bought the book to help me plan a trip to the Sierras to fish for golden trout. When I saw the charts in the appendix that list the Sierra's waters and their respective trout species, I thought I had found at least some value. Unfortunately, my copy has a number of typos that make it impossible to know which species live in what waters.Finally, the book has not been revised in sometime as there are no web sites listed nor is there any email addresses to contact agencies, outfitters, or the author himself.If you are looking to plan a trip to the Sierras, don't bother with this book. Stick to the internet."
4,"Perfect for that ""Shadow Fade""","Really clean cutting blade, saves me valuable time in cutting my kids hair. Cutting against the grain you get a nice low cut almost bald but not quite. Nice blade for that nice light shadow fade. But the truth is; it's not a ""Arctic Collection"" blade it reads that but it's not. This is why I'm giving it 4 stars for the False Advertisement..."
2,some episodes unplayable,"I found that so far several of the episodes are unplayable. The picture hangs up frequently. I found the quality disappointing, althoThe Odd Couple - The Complete Series, Seasons 1-5ugh the basic material was good."
2,Complete Series? I Think Not!,"Count me in as one of the dissatisfied customers who has patiently waited for so long to get The Odd Couple on DVD. When it's finally released this is all we get?! There is no way on earth you could get me to buy anything past season 2. Season 1 was excellent, season 2 had a few edits but nothing too noticeable. Seasons 3, 4 and 5 were edited to such a degree that the show was no longer enjoyable. Paramount, you blew it! Do yourselves a favor and look elsewhere for the proper versions of the show. (If you still have a VCR you might be able to get a Columbia House set.) But do not buy this set. Doing so will only encourage more sloppy releases from Paramount."
1,"Love THE ODD COUPLE, but would have rated THIS even lower...","Save your money unless you enjoy shelling out full-price for damaged goods. These are edited even more than the reruns on TV!Oh, and if they ever do release the unedited versions, are you gonna buy those too?What a disgrace!"
1,Edited,Thank God I read the reviews before I bought this and thank you to everyone who wrote something. I will not be buying this anytime soon ! If anyone knows where to buy an unedited box set please let everyone know
5,get your reindeer off my roof,"I have to say this is the best christmas songs I have ever heard,get your reindeer of my roof will surely give anyone joy and laughs in the holiday season,I woul'd tell everyone to get this c.d or tape,I know I loved it and there is no other songs quite like these.If people are wanting something joyful, funny, heart touching, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS C.D/ Once you hear these christmas song you will want to add them to your collections,I know I did and there is no others like this! I want to say to the writer of these songs Mr Joe Bennett/great job/And to the singer of these songs/Mr Jerry Riggins/great job/ thanks for bringing this c.d songs of christmas our way!"
4,A Lesson on Survival,"""Dry Tears"" is a memoir of the author during the years she and her family struggled for survival in occupied Poland. After many attempts to escape Nazi officials, they find shelter in a small town under the protection of a peasant Polish family, in exchange for financial benefits. The story is a lesson on faith, of compliance to ever adjusting circumstances in an environment filled with prejudice and ignorance. Well written, with no high literary aspirations, but with a high moral content. This is a must for adolescents and pre-adolescents, and for anyone who is not aware of what it really means to face adverse circumstances in life."
1,So Far So Good,"Product is showing a little difference at this time, will continue to use hoping for great results."
4,Marlfox - Excellent Read,"Marlfox is an exciting action packed book by Brian Jacques. It is the 11th book in the fantasy Redwall series. What is interesting about this series is that most of the books are stand alones.The peaceful animals that inhabit the Abby of Redwall are under attack by mysterious creatures known as Marlfoxes. These deadly creatures can appear and disappear at any given moment. And on top of that, the great Tapestry of Martin the Warrior, the great jewel of Redwall, has been stolen.It's up to the squirrel warrior Dann Reguba and the squirrel maid Song Swifteye with the help of a shrew named Dippler to get the tapestry back. They must cross the hidden lake and penetrate the island castle of Marl.This book was one of my favorites in the series because of the shocking endings of each chapter. They left me wanting to read more. I recommend this book highly."
4,Marlfox,This book was a very exciting book. It's full of action andsome drama. It also has alot of war and violence. Eventhough there'sviolence it is still and enjoyable book that I couldn't put down. I would recommend this book to teenagers and up. I don't think a little kid should read it because of the violence.
5,"AWSOME, absalutely Amazing",This book is one of the best books ever. The tale of these creaters is great. The intire series great. This is a must read book.
4,A little bit of a disapointment,I've read all the books in the Redwall Series except The Long Patrol and Pearls of Lutra. Marlfox was not as good as Redwall or Mariel of Redwall. There was hardly any battles and I didn't like the writing tecnique.
3,Could of had better battles,"I am a HUGE fan of Redwall, and I will always be. This tells me that I should be more picky in my reviewing. So this is it, my first review that wasn't so good: Marlfox was an enjoyable book, it had great songs, characters, and food. But it by far has the worst villans. No, I'm not saying the villans were not cool, but they had no strength. For instance, each villan is killed easily. and a Marlfox never really kills strong warriors in one-on-one combat. and I think Mokkan could of been in the book a bit more. he was actually a good villan. But you see, there is no really good battle except Dippler vs. Fenno {and Fenno was a bad villan anyway}. But i must say, this book is enjoyable, and i liked some of the characters. but i think you should read Pearls of Lutra or Long Patrol first.Sincerly,Robert [...]"
2,Not as good as the 1st Redwall book,"I think Marlfox could've been MUCH better. It seems that very few of the Redwall books are as good as the original and I think Marlfox is a good example.The Marlfoxes are ruthless and cruel characters, and the heroes must, as usual, defeat them. Past lessons, cruelties, and triumphs of the previous Redwall books seem to echo throughout. Padding, and tons of it, are also throughout the book in the form of songs which I got so tired of finding that I skipped past them and back into the story. I wouldn't recommended Marlfox to someone new who wants to check out the series, it's definatly not one of Jacques best."
3,Not so good....,"I liked this book, like all other Jacques' Books... But I found the begining to be very boring. It didnt catch my attention, and didn't really motivate me to read on... Although Brian Jacques has been VERY good at catching my attention with his books in the past...this book didnt. But I must say it did end up to be a very good book."
5,"Wonderful, magical book","This is a great book for anyone waiting for the next Harry Potter book. Marlfox is like Harry Potter with just a bit less magic and with, well, animals instead of people. Exciting, amazing, and suspenseful, are the perfect words to discribe this book. When magical foxes (Marlfoxes) who can disapper and reappersteal from the Redwall Abbey, it's up to a band of four unlikly friends to retrive and return the Abbey's prize possesion: the taprestry of Martain the Warrior. All of the creatures in Redwall have there strenths and weaknesses, and I'm sure you can relate to (at least) one of them. This is my favorite Redwall book other than The Outcast of Redwall."
4,A Treasured Series,"Don't be fooled by the recommended reader's age on this one -- it is a delight for adults who sometimes want the charm of a simple, wholesome book to read.Marlfox was the first of this series that I read and I am, with time for appreciation between books working my way through the others in the series.Yes, the books follow a pattern, but the generations of Redwallers pass on and new ones take their place, so some of the old are retained with the new.Write on Mr. Jacques! Write on!"
4,Marlfox Review,"This book was very good. The Redwallers need to defend themselves from yet another evil villain. This time it is the fleet, speedy, and possibly magic foxes from Castle Marl. It is very exciting.I do not want to give anything away so I will just say that Brian Jacques has written another amazing book about the animals from Redwall Abbey. He has made many great books in this series, and this book is just as good, if not better, than the rest. It was my favorite book that I've read this year."
5,"Marlfox:Fun, Exciting, and Mysterious!!","A villanious new presence is aprowl in Mossflower Woods-the family of Marlfoxes. It is said that the seven Marlfoxes are magic, they can disappear into thin air! They do not take over places, but plunders everything and brings it to their evil mother Silth. Soon the Marlfoxes reach Redwall and with their horde of rats, weasels, ferrets, and stoats, they lay seige to the building. They steal the tapestry of Martin the Warrior and brings it to Queen Silth.Dann Reguba and Song Swifteye, children of warrior squirrels travels with the young shew Dippler and Burble the water vole to the ominous island domain of the Marlfoxes and their evil leader. It takes all of of their courage and wits to go retrieve the precious tapestry and take it back to Redwall.This isn't one of my favorites in the Redwall Series. My favorite was Lord Brocktree and The Long Patrol. This book was fun, though, and I loved it!"
5,Jacques New Book Is EXTREMELY Good!!!,"I just read this book and WOW! It blew me away! Jacques has the gift to take a familiar plot, and make it seem totally different. From the evil Marlfoxes to the cheerful Noonvale players, Jacques astounded me. I highly reccomend this book."
3,"A good story, with a bad message. Pearls of Lutra best story","This is a typical Redwall story (young heroes with Martin's sword, the last book's heroes as mentors, and all the weasels, stoats, ferrets, rats and foxes as the badguys!). Now, I love Brian's stories, but the thing about the ""vermin"" always being stupid, villainous, or just plain bad, really gets on my nerves! See, foxes are my favorite animals with weasel-types running a close second (and rats are not stupid!!!). I think that Brian sterio-types his ""badguys"" to work around the problem of having them be ""people."" I think that Jacques's writing with K.A.Applegate's morals would make for a better story."
4,a living saga,this book although excellent is not as good as some of the others {martin the warrior} it lacks the time setting of the others.What I mean is that in this time most of the redwallers are either dibbuns or elders. I did like the hare florian though. He was new.
4,Our daughter loves it,"Our twelve-year-old daughter really enjoyed this book. She likes all of the Redwall books, plus the Warriors, Guardians of Ga'Hoole, Survivors, and The Named (Ratha)."
3,Not great...,"The book is better than not. That's not a big compliment, but it's better than my review of Legend of Luke. This book has a kinda stupid start when two of the supposed big, scary, Marlfoxes confront a squirrel in the woods and he takes them down, no questions asked. The head Marlfox, Mokkan, is tough enough and smart, with a typical ruthless mindset. He kills some of his crew, yadda yadda, and other stuff like that. One of the downsides to this book is the absalute consistancy of songs. I skim over them they are so common. This book does not live up to other greats such as Redwall, or Mariel of Redwall. The final fight is to dull, and it seems like Brian simply wanted to end the book and get it published. The baddies are woefully helpless, getting slaughtered by the good guys easily. I won't give away any more information about this book,but if you follow my advice, you may not find out anyway."
3,Marlfox,"Marlfox is a rather good story, but it isn't one of Brian Jacques' best. Redwall has no leaders except Cregga Rose Eyes, who refuses to be an Abbess, and the cellarkeeper from The Long Patrol is still alive, Gurrbowl. How that is possible I do not know unless moles live forever. Also the adventuring part is quite boring and the White Ghost part is a bit ridiculous."
2,One of the worst in the series,"I have been a fan of the Redwall franchise since '96 or '97. I've read all of them, but I have to say this is one of the worst in the series. It's like reading Mattimeo (one of the best ones) again, except it's a lot more boring and very predictable. Another thing is the characters, they aren't very appealing, like Florian, he's kind of like Jar Jar from Star Wars. Also, the parent's in this book seem like they did not care about their kids exploring alone. I mean, they hardly talk about them, What's up with that? And another thing. Why does every adventure (excluding the ones with Martin the Warrior) have to take place in the land of Mossflower? Jacques has to expand to some foreign land, or something. The only reason I that I would recommend this book would be to fill in the gap between the 10th and 12th novels."
3,A decent book,"Marlfox was okay. It wasn't nearly as good as the earlier Redwall books. The plot, what little of one there is, is extremely similar to previous books, only with less of the enchanting elements. The characters were all horribally undeveloped and didn't have much of personalities. And the little personality they had was kind of wussy. I don't reccomend it to most Redwall fans."
5,FANTASTIC!,"I have read evrey single Redwall book in the series( yes even the poem one) and this is great. I dont say its the best because I think Martin the Warrior is the best, but anyway, THIS IS AN AWESOME BOOK. YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK. It has a really terrific plot, and I like the way it ties up with Salamandastron. I like that in all the Redwall books. They all connect in some way."
5,Not a Disappointment,"Unlike many of the reviews I have heard about this book, I found it to be truly worthy of the Redwall name. As a fan of Brian Jacques I was not disappointed and would strongly recommend this book to others. It is a beautiful story of adventure, humour and of course FOOD! I loved it!!"
5,Love it,"I purchased this bible for my teenaged son, who had asked for it after borrowing one from his youth pastor. He loves it. I love it. I've already purchased another one for his brother and plan to purchase another one for my husband, and I've already downloaded the kindle version for myself.Not only are the questions and answers a huge help during bible study, but I have found myself just sitting and reading this bible. It's so interesting. It gives me answers to questions, that I wouldn't have even thought to ask.In addition it's just easy to read and understand. This bible is also well made. Nice leather cover. Can't go wrong with this purchase."
4,A delicious taste of Scotland.,"This is an outstanding way to immerse yourself in the culture of Scotland. Fergus, a kilt-wearing climber, starts in the slums of Glasgow and wills himself to a higher station in life. Although he is self-absorbed, Fergus has an endearing quality that will make you care deeply about him. The story becomes particularly interesting when he moves to a Hebredian island for several years late in life."
3,Good product - if not damaged in transit!,The first snorkel I ordered arrived damaged and had to be returned. The second one was fine and performed as expected. Children and grandchildren will have fun with it. The 3 star rating does not reflect the product itself but the fact that the first one was damaged.
2,Not what I expected,"The mask and snorkel I received was by BodyGlove, not PROMATE, as advertised. I did not actually use the mask, as it arrived after I left for my vacation (through absolutely NO fault of amazon or the dealer), so I don't know how well it performs. Unfortunately, the mask was a little too small for me, so I will be returning it. Otherwise, I love the bright pink color!"
4,Good but Fogs Easily,"I recently purchased this snorkel for my 1-week trip to Maui. I snorkeled every day of the week, and everything went very well. Really liked the big-ness of the actual goggles themselves. Also, the pink snorkel made it easy for other members of my group to keep track of where I was above water, which is important especially if you plan to snorkel way out from the beach! However, this snorkel features the ability to blow out air through your nose, and because of that then it makes for goggles that can fog pretty easily. I tried using sea drops, which only worked marginally well. Funny enough, plain old spit seemed to work even better."
3,Snorkeling Gear,I bought two sets of these mask/snorkel combination. Both me and my wife were disappointed with this equipment. The masks were leaking; the snorkels were too short.
5,Works as advertized,What a great product. Easy to use; doesn't allow any water in. I can swim much farther using this than I could previously.
4,scuba gear,"good mask, sometimes the snorkel will shut down when you want to breathe in and you have to blow out some more to get it to open up again"
4,Caribbean Snorkeling,"I was amazed at the price of this snorkeling mask and snorkel. I normally buy from Divers Direct but this company has the same items and less expensive. Since both my husband and I both senior citizens, we try to fine the best prices on anything we purchase."
3,Snorkle Mask,"I had problems with it leaking around the nose. My husband can use it, he says you have to blow out your nose while you are swimming with it. I don't care for it very much."
3,good for half hr...then dead,"we bought two set for our sknorkling trip, one of them was good for half hr. then water came in from nose area, the other one did the same thing after 45 min...."
5,perfect,Absolutely love this product. I have a small face and the mask fit perfectly. The snorkle was also the best I have ever used. Fast shipping.
2,Buyer Beware!,"The title of this book, as well as the description, strongly suggest that it covers circuits. Unfortunately, it appears that in this case, the meaning of ""circuit"" has been hijacked by PLC industry practitioners and assigned a jargon definition that most closely approximates the existing words ""Program"", ""Algorithm"", ""Procedure"", or ""Sequence"".As you can see, none of these words has much to do with describing:a: the complete path of an electric current including, usually, the source of electric energy.b : an assemblage of electronic elements.which are both meanings of the word ""circuit"" that can actually be found in a dictionary.If you are a USER of certain families of PLCs, perhaps this book will be of some use. However, at $50, I would strongly suggest just reading the PLC manual.If you intend to DESIGN a PLC, this book will be of absolutely NO USE, whatsoever."
1,Total ripoff,"The title on Amazon is: ""Christina Aguilera: More Than a Woman by Christina Aguilera"". Note the phrase 'by Christine Aguilera'. On the back of the DVD is the statement: THIS DVD IS NOT AUTHORISED BY CHRISTINA AGUILERA, HER MANAGEMENT OR RECORD LABEL. It contains no music from Christina Aguilera. Amazon should be ashamed for offering this piece of junk -- especially for $17.99."
4,Good to know....,A co-worker gave this book to me as a present. I read it in one day. Very entertaining and easy to read. I particularly liked the story about the Communion. Outrageous stories....good to know I'm not the only one :-)
1,Great concert if it could be heard clearly,"I was anxious to watch this DVD but I was dissappointed when I played it. The picture quality is not great, but it is to be expected from an import. The problem is that the audio track has a background hissing that gets louder as you increase the volume. Very annoying and makes it hard to watch this concert. I would wait for it to go into american production or pass on it."
3,Relationship humour,"Good, humourous look at relationships and lots of instantly understood cartoons. Doesn't just apply to heterosexual relationships, worth a look at."
4,Lighthearted look at the differences in gender,"This is another one of the books in the ""Male and female fundamental incompatibility"" genre. Expressed in the form of cartoons with text, many of them have the ""(S)he said, (S)he heard"" form. Some of them are quite funny, relationships between the sexes have always been difficult, and so while there is a great deal of exaggeration, in most cases there is a germ of truth inside the humor. If you enjoy a lighthearted look at gender differences, then you will find this book funny."
3,"Long on Detail, Short on Romance","The book is filled with lists of dates, recordings, details that overshadow the relatively brief narrative section. It reads like the good research that someone, a novelist or creative reader might use to write a really interesting biography of this fascinating character. Charlie Christian is THE seminal electric jazz guitarist. He grew up in the mid-west, journeyed to NY after being ""discovered"" as were so many other talents, by John Hammond. After a famous and dramatic audition for Benny Goodman he joined the quintet and changed jazz forever. Numerous sides from the Goodman bands illustrate his formative style in brief solos, but for the truly innovative pre be-bop, we go to the amateur recordings made after hours at Minton's -- where he held his own with Dizy and Monk at the birth of bop. His career ended shortly before his death at 23 -- yes he did all this in less than 2 years ! The story is incredibly romantic, the book is more research than romance."
3,Good details on Charlie Christian's Recording Career,"This book is a great reference for anyone interested in the recoding history of Charlie Christian. The book also touches on his background and roots in music, detailing his childhood experiences and following his path to success. Unfortunately, the book offers little about his personality or personal life outside his musical career."
3,Blue Hawaii,I loved the theme and beautiful views of Hawaii. I am a major Elvis fan. This doesn't compare to Viva Las Vegas.
2,Blue Hawaii,"Elvis is fabulous and this movie is really nicely done. However, the sound is not good, especially when Elvis sings the recording breaks up. It is a shame when we have such a beautiful movie on DVD to enjoy at home."
4,A fun Elvis flick with Hawaii from the 60s,"I got this Elvis movie mainly because it includes scenery from the old Coca Palms Hotel that was on Kauaii, Hawaii. I also enjoyed the other scenery from Hawaii of the 60s. As with pretty much all Elvis movies, the plot is thin (Elvis returns from the military and wants to do his own thing instead of working in his rich parents' pineapple business) but the music is ok and it's relaxing entertainment."
5,Blue Hawaii,"This is the Favorite, love the actress that plays Miley, musical numbers are good, this is an Elvis classic."
4,Blue Hawaii CD,Good music. Elvis is still the King. Brings back memories of when people used to sing and people used to listen.
5,Blue Hawaii DVD is SUPERB!,"The new DVD blows away the new Paramount VHS that is out now...The print is superb (letterbox), and the SOUND is really amazing! They REMIXED the songs and the music for TRUE 5.1...vocals in the center, instruments left and right, and the Jordanaires come at you from behind! The sound truly envelopes you...TRUE ELVIS FANS ARE IN FOR A TREAT! Get this DVD! (This disc rates a ""5"" on the Elvis scale...)"
3,Blue Hawaii,Very good movie. Bought this one as a gift to replace a vhs that has stopped working. He was very surprised to get it.
5,"Greatest Elvis movie....""Aloha Bra""","Elvis and cast are at their top in this fun loving Hawaiian location film. Storyline is healthy and wholesome, music is upbeat as always and great! Sometimes I just pop this movie in for background. I lived in Hawaii for years and makes for a good fix!Elvis, take me away..."
2,So So Elvis Film.,"Elvis got about everything he wanted in life except what he wanted most.To become a first rate actor.Elvis along with other actors like Dick Powell and Frank Sinatra complained that they were doing too many musicals.Dick Powell got his his big chance with Murder My Sweet and Frank Sinatra with From Here To Eternity which sent them on their way.Alas,Elvis never did.Getting back to Blue Hawaii I thought the soundtrack to this film was much better than the film itself.(Cant Help Falling In Love,Rock A Hula Baby,Moonlight Swim,etc)However,just for the songs alone the film is worth seeing.The only time Elvis and Angela Lansbury ever worked together.Jenny Maxwell and her husband were murdered years later.(No conspiracy ideas,Please.)Also in cast Roland Winters,Steve Brodie,Joan Blackman,(Who plays Elvis Love interest)and Iris Adrian,etc..Its too bad Elvis didnt make more Flaming Stars and King Creoles.He could have, sooner or later made it like Frank and Dick did."
4,"Blue Hawaii, an Elvis classic",I think this movie or Viva Las Vegas made me a huge fan of Elvis. Any guy who could get a load of hot looking women in swim suits to chase him was my idol. I actually do love the songs and the picturesque scenary in this movie too.
4,This is my favorite Elvis Movie...So Far,"So, I haven't seen very many Elvis movies but this is the film that peaked my interest in watching the King's movies in the first place. He is truly mesmerizing. The scenery, music, and costumes in this movie are kitchy but perfect. It harkens back to a simplier time and place, which makes it a great counterbalance to all the crime dramas I love.You might want to wait and catch on cable, but if you want a chance to sit back and enjoy a great, simple, colorful, and innocent movie, go ahead and splurge on this DVD."
2,An Offbeat Mess,"Something went very, very wrong when Warner Brothers decided to do this version of the Maltese Falcon. It appears they decided to lighten it up, although I'm not sure if they were going for full out comedy. The result is a strange mess that succeeds neither as comedy or as detective mystery. Warren William overplays the detective hired by various people to locate a horn full of jewels. Bette Davis overplays the femme fatale, and various character actors overplay the rest of the gang looking for the horn. The mystery is a bit confusing, despite the fact I have read the book and seen the superior 1941 version. I guess you could kindly say this version is offbeat. It was too offbeat for me!"
4,Hilarious!,"This is a MUST for the total fan of Bette Davis. Her entrance is just great--in trenchcoat and spectacles. You can't miss her as she slinks into her chair. The movie itself is rather uneven, but well worth watching. Were these people all drunk while making the film? Warren William surely was. And really, he looked much more like Sam Spade from the original book ""The Maltese Falcon"" than Bogie did. Personally, I think this film has a more West Coast feel than the later movie, with all the unstable characters. Don't get me wrong, I think the Bogart/Astor version is definitely superior, but this movie is a lot of wacko fun."
2,Nothing to do with Watch on the Rhine,"A reviewer says that this movie is based on Watch on the Rhine--not so. (That's a play by Lillian Hellman.) This movie is based, as the other reviews indicate, on The Maltese Falcon. However, the reviewer who made that mistake is otherwise correct--it's a very disappointing movie. In fact, it's puzzling why anyone would take Hammet's The Maltese Falcon and do this tepid waste."
1,Too bad Satan didn't meet a director,"I have tried to watch ""Satan Met a Lady"" quite a few times now, because I have seen some good performances by the lead, Warren William, but this is one bad movie. I don't know what happened, but William just weirded out on this awful version of ""The Maltese Falcon"". Bette isn't much help, Arthur Treacher slightly better than Bette. Those who made this picture must have had some vision in mind, but the message remains arcane. I don't understand why Warren William is directed in this bizarre way--it seemed a suicide mission in terms of outlandish histrionics. I don't think I shall ever sit through this in its entirety, so one star is the best it can get from me."
4,Grief and Loss,I read this book as part of a college course. The book was very goood and went into a lot of detail. It was a lot of information but interesting!
3,student,"This book may be the best in the world, but it is far to expensive for a book written in 2005. If I did require this for a class I would not have ordered the book. Someone must be making allot of money from the sale."
3,"Okay, not very reliable...","The mouse keeps turning off and on. I think that retractable wire loosens the connection, which causes mouse to turn off and on. Hence, the product didn't work for me. HOpe u guys have good luck."
2,Waste of money...,"Waste of money...This book is good only for school projects and absolutely not useful for artists, restorers or woodworkers.Very amateur...Featuring stone age techniques, which can only discourage the follower.Don't give any choice of supplies, don't warn about possible mistakes an failures during the process and do not say how to avoid or fix those mistakes.Anyway... Following this book amateur will only get frustrated:Spend a fortune for supplies and sabotage there treasures...Professionals or semi-professionals - simply don't need it...Businesses which selling supplies and gold leaf offer a seminars and comprehensive guides ""how to"" for gold leafing. Much more useful...About restoration - still searching for good info..."
2,How Disappointing,"A book to put down. This latest work of Cook started out as just boring, soon escalated to annoying and ended up thoroughly disappointing. Cook needs to stop producing books from the same tired mold. (strong, competent yet mistreated female Dr.; poor little sick child; neanderthal-thinking men; profit obsessed & ruthless hospital administrators and insurance companies as the villians) We have all seen this in his past works and Toxin is yet another churning out of the same old theme. It worked well before but its time to move on. Has Cook's fame and notoriety have left him out of touch with his reading public?"
4,A great read that will convince most readers to give up meat,"Robin Cook does an excellent job of involving the reader in the story of a meat industry and inspection team run amok. The situation of his only daughter's death is realistic in a world where mad cow disease and E. Coli make headlines frequently. The big problem with the book comes with the interpersonal relationships, but Cook does a fantastic job of convincing the reader that the USDA should not be in charge of inspecting and grading meats. As usual, the book leaves the reader wishing he could do something to change the situation, other than read about the deaths of innocents."
3,No burgers for me!,"I have read most of Cook's novels and this is the firsxt one that affected me like this. Others in the room were cracking up as I let some ""ewwww's"" and ""gross"" escape my lips. I was thoroughly disgusted by the descriptions of the meat industry. However, I did finish the book cover to cover in one day. It is definitely a page turner!"
3,Disappointing,"In spite of what should have been riveting subject matter, this book fails. You get tired of the author fighting his battles through his characters. I'm sorry but when I'm reading escapist fare, I don't want to hear repeated whinnings about how the health care system is ripping off these several hundred thousand dollar a year specialists. Too much of Cook's own agenda repeatedly spilled through to his characters. Too much preaching, too little character development!"
4,BETTER THAN CHROMOSONE 6,"I enjoy Robin Cook's books - I think I've read them all. This book is one of his better ones. The plot kept me interested throughout and the descriptions of the slaughterhouse bothered me, but not enough to give up beef. I think there is nothing more tragic than having to bury one of your children, especially the way Kim's daughter Becky died. (By the way, the synopsis of this book says that Kim's SON gets sick and dies. Where did that come from?!?) I didn't buy the sudden reconciliation of Kim and Tracy, though, and the ending was pretty weak. All in all, it was an interesting book, a little above average, and I would buy his next book without hesitation."
2,"Long on alarmism, short on reason, but an interesting story","As usual, Dr. Cook has written another ""page-turner."" I couldn't put the book down. After ""Chromosome 6,"" I vowed that I would not read another of his books, but I read ""Toxin"" anyway. His diatribe against the beef industry is right off Oprah and his descriptions of meat packing are right out of PETA fund-raising material: it sounds disgusting, but it didn't convince me go give up beef. Pass me a burger! On top of all this, the ending was very weak."
5,One of Cook's Best,"When I picked up this book, I thought this book was going to end up being a corny, scientific drama. I WAS WRONG! This book is suspensful, action-packed, and frightingly real. It makes you wonder what your eating at a fast food place."
1,How did Robin Cook get famous?,"This book has some of the worst, most robotic and un-natural sounding dialogue I have ever encountered. The protagonist is supposed to be an ego-driven surgeon but he is more of a sociopath than anything. If this is the quality of Dr. Cook's writing in all his novels, it is incomprehensible to me how he became a best-seller. There is not a chance that I would ever read another of his novels."
4,intensely facinating,Toxin is the first of Robin Cook's books that I have read.From start to finish I couldn't put it down.I must say the ending was abrupt.What happened to the reporter's daughter?Anyway the subject certainly gives you something to think about.Can't wait to read his other titles!
2,A below par effort for Cook....too much social commentary!,The whole story gets lost in an attempt to make a social statment. The ending comes off as if Dr Cook either had a deadline or his printer ran out of paper. Even for Cook fans..stay away.
1,Toxin is Toxic,"The worst Robin Cook book I have read. The story itself isn't bad, but the characters and dialogue are terrible! This is one of those few books where I say I could have done better. The unrealistic actions and stilted words of the main character hurt. Dr. Cook can and has done so much better."
2,First Robin Cook book I've read and was not impressed.,"The ecoli plot was good, but the main character was not believable & the ending seemed rushed and unfinished. A surgeon who beats up co-workers & risks his own life by going undercover as a floor sweeper seems far fetched to me."
2,"terrible, terrible dialogue, characters and no direction.","I usually enjoy Robin Cook, some of his earlier stuff is great, but I don't know what happened to him this time, the supposed cardiac surgeon was acting like a ridiculous spoiled brat, no-one really seemed to care about Becky dying, the dialogue absolutely stank and the ending was not fair, we don't find out properly what happens to the meat industry, and the couple, but you know, I didn't even really care. The only thing I got out of it was the insight on how burgers are made."
2,Cook Cooks up a barely digestible concoction,"I admit. I have been a big fan of Dr. Cook. In fact I will read his next book as soon as it comes out - out of habit and because he has entertained well in the past. But face it, the man is burnt out. His characters are cartoons whose dimesionality makes Bugs Bunny look 4-D! In his recent books he is pushing an agenda here or his opinion there. Well that is his prerogative. He can choose to write fiction that is fairly boring. How long his loyal readers are going to suffer...I may read his next book, but after that...well lets just wait and see. In the meantime - just buy irradiated burgers and fire up that grill."
2,Could have been good,"The book starts out promisingly, but goes rapidly downhill from there. The characters go from interesting to cardboard in the space of a dozen pages, and the additional bad guys are way too assuming that they can't get caught. The most interesting character in the story is the hired hitman from Chicago, but he plays naught more then a bit part in the last 1/3 of the book.I spent the last 1/3 of the book flipping pages because everything was too unbelievable at that point. In the end you're left with not much more then a diatribe against the meat industry."
3,Revengeful rather than medical,"I second the motion of many readers that the ending is disappointing. I hoped for the ending to be the opposite of what I expect, to say the least of it. I only read ""The Year of The Intern"", ""Outbreak"" , ""Blindsight"" and this ""Toxin"" by the author. ""Toxin""must be the fourth poor work of RC. Dr. Kim Reggis delves deeply(or mainly) into ""retaliation"" rather than ""toxin"" research. I wonder ordinary? skilled cardiac surgeons in the US are also hot-tempered, acting impulsively, childish, and lacking in intelligence like Dr.Reggis."
1,Toxin was a huge dissapointment for this reader.,"This book was purchased in hardcover with expectations of the usual level of quality of the Robin Cook novel. A waste of money was my reward. Within the first two chapters the reader knows who the bad guy is, what will happen to the main characters and all of the main players who will be involved. The anger of the main character was the sole focus of most of the writing and became old so fast. I forced myself to read the first 150 pages and then could bear no more. I am disappointed that the editor and publisher let this one out when they had to know how poorly it was written. One can only assume that they were willing to ride on the name of Robin Cook. This is insulting to the reader as it assumes that we will read any drivel they put in front of us. As a result, this reader will never put out the money for a hard cover Robin Cook novel again. It will either be paperback or better yet, the library for me."
4,I'll never eat another hamburger!,"Robin Cook convincingly presents a case against today's meat-packing industry and the USDA in this enthralling mystery. Cook never writes about a topic without thoroughly researching every aspect of it. Although the ending was skimpy, this book is worth reading for anyone who cares about public health and doesn't mind being grossed out!!!"
2,"quick read, shallow story","Cook has the idea right on this one, but doesn't seem to know where to follow through. First he's focusing on the managed health care dilema in our society and then he decides that the USDA and slaughter-houses are a better target. Finally, he thinks that by throwing in a hit-man he'll keep the reader's attention. Sorry, no dice. It was a quick read with no real substance that I cared about."
1,ROBIN COOK'S WORST YET!,"I HAVE READ A COUPLE OF ROBIN COOK'S BOOKS BEFORE TOXIN BUT I THINK THIS IS THE WORST YET! I HAVE DWELLED LONGER ON THE DEATHS OF SMALL ANIMALS KILLED IN THE ROADWAY THAN THE DOCTOR GRIEVED FOR HIS ""BELOVED"" DAUGHTER! AND WHAT ABOUT ALL THE LOOSE ENDS? ROBIN COOK HAS NEVER BEEN TOP NOTCH BUT AFTER TOXIN, I'M SWEARING OFF HIS BOOKS FOR GOOD!"
1,Maybe the single most annoying character in modern fiction,"Anybody who remembers the Robin Cook of Outbreak fame and the body of his early efforts is in for a huge disappointment with this outpouring of vitriol and what sounds like pure spite. It makes you wonder if Mr. Cook was abandoned by a meat-packer, deadbeat dad or something. If there has ever been a more annoying, unsympathetic protagonist than this wacko cardiac surgeon. It's the first time in my life that I wanted to jump into the book and slap the dickens out of a character.Cook has never been a grand master of his art, and is not a prodigious talent, but, at one time, he was good for a fun, exciting read. But with inane plotting, lifeless characterization, a total inability to involve the reader in the concerns of the protagonist, and bland, unsatisfying conclusions, turkeys like Toxin & Chromosome 6, God help us, are likely to leave the reader bored and uninspired."
3,"Attend to the message, not the medium&#65533;GET the N. Fox book!","A pretty typical Cook novel written with his particular formula style. The most important thing for me was Cook's suggestion, at the end of the book, to read Spoiled-A Food Chain Gone Haywire. There really are problems with food borne pathogens. Cook gets our attention, but Fox does an excellent job of documenting and writing about them."
1,Dr. Cook is in dire need of an editor or a ghost-writer.,"Robin Cook has always told a good story, filled with good science. His writing skills, particularly in terms of dialogue, have always been weak, but he hits a new all-time low with Toxin. Has this guy gone his entire life without ever having heard two normal humans converse? No one on the planet speaks the way Cook's characters do. I've read all of his works, have enjoyed most and have learned a little something with each experience. But Toxin was the end of the line for me. A first-class stinker all around."
1,Simply Awful!,"i've read at least 15 Robin Cook books by now, and i really dont know what happened with this one. this has got to be one of the worst pieces of fiction i've ever read. the characters were one-dimensional and fake, the dialogue utterly fake and forced, and the plot, while okay in broad strokes, was in its details totally contrived and unbelievable. i kept going only to see if there was going to be some sort of interesting plot twist.... Robin Cook, what is going on??"
1,"Ah, the memory of this 'book'","Once, many years ago, i was stuck on an oil rig, offshore. Nothing to do, and had run out of my own books.I found a copy of this appalling book.It is the worst book I have ever read. I had no choice.At one point I burst out laughing like some madman, after reading some particular piece of 'dialogue'. Stunningly badly written.So bad, I felt sorry for the editor and proofreaders.There is a reason this book has 71 (now 72) 1 star reviews - it really is that bad, and there is no zero star option.Coops"
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Robin Cook must be kidding me!I have only read one other book by Cook, but you can be sure that a third book is not on my want list. This is crazy, his characters are so FAKE, the conversation so unnatural...words like ""lunkhead"", who in the world uses ""lunkhead"" in conversation. I can appreciate that Cook is attepmting to try and make a statment woth the story, it is very editorial but certainly not interesting or realistic.It is fast paced, simply because the writing is sooooo simple. So childlike. The ""hero"" a surgeon, is not someone we root for, he's a big pain the the neck. He is to worried about running around looking to punch someone or point a finger than be at his gravely ill daughter's bedside. and of course he finds all the impossible answers in the most unrealistic way.Please don't waste your time with this immature drivel. go read some Nelson Demille or Stephen King and see what it is like to create a real character."
4,After reading this book you can't avoid becaming vegetarian,"I was really fascinated by this book, and as a vegetarian myself I couldn't avoid feeling relief. Apart from the problem of meat itself I think we are too used to consider every food as normal, but we should think how it can happen that food once so difficult to buy now is so cheap. Obviously there must be some problems, either concerning safeness or concerning suffering for people or animals. I'm not really a vegetarian (at least not yet), but I just avoid eating meat because of the suffering during life and death of animals. In any case I think we are so little natural in our way of eating so much meat, we can't avoid having some problems. Perhaps this book can make people think about this topic and I'm grateful to Robin Cook for this. Anna Laura Costa - Italy"
1,The characters were unbelievably stupid!,I'm not sure which poses the greater risk to one's well-being -- eating tainted beef or reading the book.
1,Insults our intelligence,What a farce and waste of money. Last Cook book I buy. Unbelievable actions by a MD leave you wondering why publishers will pay for this material. Not a believable character at all.
2,Dissapointed!,After reading excellent works like Mutation and coma this book came as a big dissapointment. The story was very much predictable and there was no twists and turns that would have made the book much more unputtable. It could hardly be expected off a well educated and well placed surgeon to go about punching people who were just going about doing their duty. The part about Kim transforming himself into a punk to gain employment in the slaughterhouse was not very convincing. At one point I had to roll my eyes when Kim hands the gun back to Tracy before going into the slaughterhouse. What kind of nutcase would do that after 2 attempts on his life? :-) Anyway waiting for a better work from Robin Cook. Of course I still remain his true fan.
1,"Tiresome polemic with boring unsympathetic ""hero""","This is a tiresome polemic in which an arrogant, spoiled brat orders his daughter to eat undercooked meat and then blames everyone but himself for the resulting tragedy. The ""hero"" is so busy finding scapegoats, assaulting people, and whining about his balance book that he can't be bothered to be at his daughter's side while she is in the hospital because he's too busy thinking about how _he_ feels. And the book's bizarre assertion that the restaurant is a ""victim of the meat industry"" because they didn't cook their food is beyond me."
3,A soapbox for Dr. Cook to express his views.,"This was not his best. Unfortunately, I do believe that much of what he is writing is true and we probably need to be informed. But he sure used this book to express his displeasure with the way health care could go, the USDA, the beef industry, etc. etc. It seemed to be less entertaining fiction and more proselytizing on his part. I agree with others, I may not be as quick to get his next book."
2,Disappointed,Wish I had read these reviews before I picked up the book! I agree that the dialogue and characters were contrived and the ending lets the reader down. The poor reader spends all this time waiting to see what happens and ends up with having to fill in the blanks on their own. Very unsatisfying. Too bad...the subject is one worth exploring in a meaningful way. Cook missed his chance.
2,Disgusting,"The book has obvious agendas, and trying to make these work the author sacrifices the story to them. Obviously, Robin Cook has a beef with the beef industry and the managed care systems. While his criticisms may be valid, they are so overblown that the reader is initially scared silly by the conditions, then finally turned off to the book which seems to be just a propaganda piece written for Dr. Cook's beliefs. While I suspect the conditions he writes about might actually occur, hopefully very rarely, the way it is done is so disgusting that one can't possibly enjoy the book. Do yourself a favor and don't even start the book."
2,an unlikeable protagonist.,"With such an uncontrolable temper and such poor judgement, I'm only glad that Kim Regis isn't my Thoracic Surgeon! (I can only shudder to imagine what might happen if something went wrong while I was under anesthesia and he held the scalpel!) No,I couldn't feel the slightest sympathy for the man or care whether or not he is successful in his quest for revenge for the death of his daughter (not son). He doesn't seem to care about the death of an innocent Dept. of Agriculture Inspector either. Of course she showed pretty poor judgement, too. I failed to become very caring about the quality of our meat processing procedures. Wildly improbable plot."
1,This is a book that Dr. Cook never completed.,"Toxin provided a fascinating and frightening introduction to the meat packing industry and the danger of e.coli bacteria. this insight could have been provided in twenty pages or less. It was a very lopsided indictment of managed healthcare as seen the eyes of a dangerous egomaniac. The indictment could have been summarized in less than ten pages. The story of Kim Reggis could have been a great one, if only it had been completed. This book brings nothing to a conclusion. The reader finishes the last page and says, ""where's the beef?"" This will be the last Robin Cook book I spend money on."
4,Enough with the drama!,"OK, I admit, this book was pretty gross, but to give up eating meat? That's a little extreme (and if you truly love a big steak like I do, NOTHING will change your mind)! Alas, like other Cook novels, the main character is pretty predictable (friend or family member hurt, character fights the system, triumphs but doesn't get all he wants) but the story was engaging and a good page turner."
2,BORING!!!!,"What happened to the ending? I expected more from Mr. Cook after his other successful stories. Although the information about food safety will stay with me, this plot was boring and predictable."
3,stunning!,"As a parent, this book really struck a chord with me. It scared me to think what could and does happen at fast food restaurants. Dr. Cook does a great job with his protagonist's reactions. Kim Reggis is a doctor and a father and the pain and helplessness he feels when he's unable to save his daughter brought tears to my eyes. Dr. Cook is obviously speaking from the point of view of someone who has seen death and tears of loved ones. The ending was a bit weak and left a lot to be desired, but the emotions evoked while reading the novel are well worth suffering through the contrived ending."
1,A Terrible Ending!,The idea of the book was not to bad. The beginning was very slow and a bit boring. It seemed as though Mr. Cook introduced many characters and did not develop them. It was very interesting to read about the meat industry. It definetly makes me think twice before eating meat. If you have a weak stomach this is not the book for you. The ending was very poor. The reader is left hanging and wondering what has happened legally to the main characters. The book overall seemed choppy. There also seemed to be no real climax. Read a different Robin Cook book this one is by far the worst.
4,Goodbye fast food,"If you love Burger King and McDonald's, don't pick this book up. A stunning look into what really happens to make meat. Good enough to turn you vegetarian."
3,NOT THE BEST ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE BEEF INDUSTRY,"Robin Cook's ""Toxin"" is the latest in a long line of fine medical thrillers,but not his best. His description of the beef processing industry is enough to turn you vegan and what he thinks of managed care makes you long for the days of Dr. Welby.However, his main character is weak and the plot predictible. The ending left me dissatisfied. I wish there had been more closure."
1,"Good idea, poorly writen","I have read all of Robin Cook's books, and have noticed quite a decline in the past few titles. However, Toxin certainly is the worst written in quite a while. An interesting and potentially fascinating look at the subject matter is lost by poor character development, dispicable dialogue and irrational actions. Along with the revealing information on E. coli and the meat processing industry, this book is also a commentary on the American medical system. Obviously, the author is not pleased with its current direction, but he does not use realistic examples to get the point across. Perhaps Dr. Cook should take a breather; I wouldn't mind waiting a few years for his next title if it could be well written.Bottom line: a struggle to finish."
1,Robin Cook has the elements of a book that needs completion.,"Robin Cook left us wondering what happened to the hero, his girl, the martyr who was killed, and in general never bothered to finish the book. I guess he thought he was leaving us with the feeling of a monsterous plot left ongoing to harm us all. The initial plot had some promise, but was stretched to the point of unbelievability very rapidly. As a physician very familiar with the problems with managed care, even I found this book preposterous. Michael Palmer is a much better read."
1,Very Disappointed,"This is the first Robin Cook book I've tried and I certainly will not make the mistake again. Not only is Cook's prose awkward throughout, the plot gets more and more preposterous as the book progresses. The doctor goes to a TV reporter with information about a missing USDA inspector, finds human blood in the place she disappeared and is chased away from that spot by a knife-toting killer. The reporter's response? No story here. The same doctor is attacked again by the killer in his home. He and his wife barely escape. She suggests they call the police. No, he says. They wouldn't do anything. The doctor sneaks into a slaughterhouse under the pretense of being an illegal Mexican alien (with blond hair). But he speak only a few words of Spanish and uses English words like ""pristine."" It just goes on and on. I don't mind suspending belief a little, but the author gives his readers no credit at all in this book."
3,"Once you read this, you WILL NOT eat meat !","This was definately not Cook's best book by any means, but I had an interest in the E. Coli virus before reading this title, so personally, I enjoyed it. Overall, the main character is sometimes very irritating and annoying but what he eventually finds out is startling and will make you terrified of some of the contents of ground meat. It is worth reading if you want to become a vegetarian."
1,Why Did I Read this Waste of Time Book?,"This book was a total waste of time. The dialogue was terrible, the characters unbelievable, the construction awful. If there was a rating below one star or even minus stars, that's what I would have chosen. I kept hoping for it to get better and it NEVER did. God forbid I should pick up another Robin Cook book. Toxin was so bad I wouldn't even put it out on a table at a yard sale if for no other reason than to protect others from reading it. I hope Dr. Cook is a better doctor than writer -- if not he must be plagued with malpractice lawsuites."
5,Who Could put this book down?,"For the people that criticized this book down and dirty like ""read so and so he's a much better writer"" Obviously dont know a good book when they read one or perhaps they dont understand what they are reading. I read this book in 2 days, it was one of the most intriguing books I have read, yes the ending did sort of leave you hanging, but the first and middle parts made up for it, as for the characters being exaggerated, not so, there are many people that are just like Kim Regis and the other characters as well. I am Robin Cooks' biggest fan, I've read almost every one of his best selling novels, and I have loved everyone of them. This book is a real look into the meat industry and should make you think about what you're really eating, it did me. Because e.coli is real folks and this could happen."
5,A chilling and frightening masterpiece!,"Some people say that the ending leaves the situation unresolved. And, in a way, it does. But, that's the way the world works; especially with the meat industry. You can't just bring all the dirty, behind-the-scenes deeds to a close, once and for all! Those kind of things are always going to be a fact of life, and that's what Cook was trying to show. The book as a whole is my favorite Cook book I've read yet. Masterfully penned, hauntingly real, and a real page turner! The only downer was the character of Kim Reggis was a little over-done. Come on! No one has a personality THAT hyper! The guy flips out if he doesn't get his way after asking once! His character could've been better written. But, as I said, Robin Cook has written a positively surreal thriller, and one that will surely make you think."
3,my review,"This book deals with the story of a doctor who sees his daughter infected with the E.Coli virus. Even though he cannot save her, he becomes involved in the investigation.As usual, Robin Cook has managed to bring a very important subject into his books. E.Coli virus is today's news and he makes it possible for the reader to understand just how exposed we all are.The plot is interesting and well thought-out as well as the characters who are well integrated into the story.Good read and entertaining."
2,Irritatingly Cliche-ridden,"I wanted to slap the protagonist, slap his ex-wife, slap his girlfriend and, until she got sick, slap his kid (what 10-year-old do you know who says ""fabulous""?). These characters are some of the most unsympathetic and poorly fleshed-out I've seen in Cook's books. In order to make us care about his causes, he needs to make us care about his characters. The egocentric surgeon, the bimbo girlfriend, the resentful ex-wife, the spoiled, manipulative child, the uncaring, evil corporation - we've seen these cliches a million times."
2,Put me off my burger,"Reading books like _Coma_ and _Brain_ will make you a Robin Cook fan. Reading a book like _Toxin_ will just put you off your burger.It was a very interesting and promising premise. However, the annoying main character and the stereotypical supporting cast made the book, uh, less palatable.You'll learn some fun science, though! FYI, not every 0157:H7 infection ends like this. People do recover.Go read his earlier work."
4,Brace Yourself,"From the get-go this book is an attention grabber, and Cook uses sickening imagery to hook his reader throughout. While the characters and dialogue are a bit flat, the story itself moves at a breakneck pace, following an all-too believable series of events meant to describe a worst-case scenario involving bacteria-laden meat and how the mistake of a couple of idiots can completely turn a handful of lives upside-down. I'm warning you this book is not for the weak-stomached or feint of heart. Cook's descriptions of a child succumbing to a particular strain of all-too-common bacteria and his portrait of a particularly nasty beef industry can make you physically ill. This was a book I couldn't put down and had a terrible time slowing myself down at the end so I could get all the details instead of just racing ahead to the intriguing conclusion. Thick, but a fast read. Prepare to eat vegetarian for awhile afterward."
3,farfetched but kept me turining the pages,"despite the stilted dialogue and the cardboard characters, this book had me glued to my chair. at times the plot was a little far fetched, but was a great read nonetheless. after reading this i am seriuosly considering turning vegetarian!"
2,Quick Read but Disappointing,"Aspects of the book were suspenseful and quick-paced. However, in general, I felt that there were too many plot deviations that weighed the story line down instead of enriching it."
4,"NOT ROBIN COOK'S BEST, BUT A GOOD ONE","Robin Cook is an excelent writer; this no one can deny. Although TOXIN kept me turning the pages quickly, it was not his best. Sometimes the plot seemed too forced, and in other situations, the main character was so nervous that we could thought he was going to come to the real world and punch the reader. But when we reach page 180, the book gets better and it's almost impossible to put it down. I enjoyed it quite a bunch and I'd tell you to buy it. You'll won't be disappointed with Robin Cook. I think you'll never be. He's great. And Toxin, wonderful.Also recommended: CHROMOSOME 6 and MUTATION"
3,A page turner that is far-fetched.,"Toxin was my fifth book by Robin Cook. The story kept me intrigued but became too far-fetched at the end. In Toxin, Robin Cook doesn't know when enough is enough."
2,so so,"The plot had too many holes. For example, when the USDA inspector was caught in the record room of the slaughterhouse wouldn't the management in reality at least hide the files she discovered the incriminating evidence in? Instead they returned the file so that it can be conveniently found again and stolen by the main character at the end of the book. Not believable."
3,Well...,"I did not particularly believe the extreme nature of Kim's outbursts. That and the fugitive ending. Oh, well. Other than that I did enjoy the book."
4,Makes you think twice,"My father is an MD,and has also worked in HMO's so I can relate to this somewhat. The book was fairly detailed which helped give it credibility. The book kept you in suspense, until the end when the story basically just stopped. I would definetely recommend reading this, though."
1,"First, and Last, Robin Cook Novel","Toxin was the first Robin Cook novel I have read. I picked it up from the free ""exchange"" bin at my local library...and it was worth every cent.This novel was incredible propaganda from start to when I could not read anymore... The main character is an unbelievable doctor/crusader/nut case with anger management issues... The ""drama"" is one patient through most of the book, while at the same time trying to make the reader believe what a huge, widespread issue the tainted meat and managed care is. While I believe most of the underlying problems, they just were not presented in a way that made me care or invest in the characters.This was just terrible ""preaching"" in the form of an unenjoyable book. You'll see this is my first review, and I read 2-3 novels a month. It was that bad..."
2,Annoying...,"I found this book very annoying. The author either doesn't trust his own dialogue or the intelligence of his readers because it seems like EVERY verb is followed by an adverb. If the writing was better, we wouldn't need something like ""sarcastically"" after ""said"".The story? Eh. I didn't find the main character very believable and a lot of it (including the romance) seemed contrived. I don't think that actions of the hospital staff were very believable. Read it and see if you don't agree."
1,one of robin cook's worst,"this might be nearly the worst in a LONG line of really bad books---- by robin cook. horrible dialogue, anachronistic sentences, poor character development (unless you read all his books, because then its good character development, i.e., theyre all the same), unbelievable situations, really poor science (science, whats that??) and unbelievable MDs who become a wikipedia entry on things they know nothing about --- did i mention the worst caricatures that ive ever read? the bad guys are fat and boorish, the worst bad guys are no speaka da engleese mexican (really racist, did i add that?) the moralizing drove me crazy reading it!that being said, if you like ""dirk pitt"" like dialogue and nubile ""dirk pitt"" women, then it might be hard to put down.found this in a recycle bin at my mom's house, read it on the ride home, should have left it in the recycle bin..."
3,Who would want this guy for their Surgeon ?,"Dr Regis is supposed to be a star performer at his job,but loses his cool at the ordinary stuff! If nothing else, I loved the reality of the ER waiting room. Everyone should get to say "" See here,don't you know who I am? "" before they're told to sit down and wait their turn ! Second point; if you're still paranoid about Mad Cow Disease coming here to the USA , there's plenty of info on the WEB now,to scare the hell out of you. Don't forget, HAM is the only thing that you won't find in Hamburger !"
4,Who is Sheldon? I think it's Becky...hellooooo,"I read this book three times trying to find who Sheldon was. The only child of Doctor Reggis in the book I read is BECKY!! Your reviewer should probably not burn the midnight oil to finish the novel for your reviews (at least not two at once). It's a great read, however, and I highly recommend the vegan way of life."
2,Good story poorly told,"This could have been a great story with real suspense but instead ended up being a laughable and cliche'd parody of itself. Robin Cook may be a good doctor, he is not a writer, the characters are shallow and monochromatic and the dialogue is juvenile at best. My eleven year old daughter and myself both thought it was poorly written and developed."
2,"Good subject, rushed ending","I really enjoyed the subject matter of Toxin. With the E. coli outbreaks in the past years, it hits pretty close to home. What I didn't like about the book was the rushed ending. It felt unfinished. Where did Kim and his ex-wife go? Was he still facing murder charges? No one ever said anything about the missing safety inspector, whose head was found in the basement of the slaughterhouse. Also, it took a long time for the actual action to start. The daughter dies almost at the end of the book, which is when they started uncovering the conspiracy. The book seemed very rushed and seemed unfinished."
2,Interesting till Cook got tired near the end,"I had trouble sympathizing with the good surgeon and his whining about billings and HMO's. However, Cook did portray the prima donna aspect of the surgeon quite well. And I know of what if speak as I work in a hospital (although a Canadian one). However, several bits at the end troubled me and made me think Cook was eager to finish this book off (maybe his beeper went off?) The ending was unsatisfying, not in the way his characters handled everything, but in how several plot lines disappeared. And how was the good surgeon and his ex-wife going to escape the country after the news was released? And how come no one cared about what happened to the veterinarian? And why did Cook tar the entire legal system (and hence justify the surgeon's reluctance to go to the police) with a quick throw away line about the O.J trial? Next time, turn your beeper off and finish the book."
2,Bad execution of a good plot,"The plot to this book had terrific potential. While I am not squeamish, I felt that the some of the graphic descriptions where not necessary. Dr. Regis' character was arrogant while his actions were predictable for most of the book. This book ends abruptly without letting the reader know what happens to the main characters."
4,TOXIN,"This book begins with Dr. Kim Reggis getting his daughter from his devorced wife. His daughter wanted to eat at a fastfood restaurant so they did. Because the burger was rare she caught e-coli and Kim becomes determined to find out how. This book go through the slaughterhouse the processing plant and reveals how corrupt the meat industry really is. It shows how they care more of profit than of the publics safety. This book will make you think twice, maybe three times before you eat another hamburger or meat product again. While I still eat meat I don't sugesst this book to anyone that gets easily disgusted, because it is quite gruesome. Despite all of that though it is a real eye opener and I suggest this book to just about anyone with the stomach to handle it."
1,This man is not a writer!,"Robin Cook knows his subject, and the plot could well be developed into a thrilling movie, but I was continually frustrated by the stilted, wooden quality of his writing. His characters are poorly developed stereotypes who speak in unnatural voices, and instead of showing a character's feelings through subtle behaviour and quirkiness, Cook tells the reader what a character is thinking - a sure sign of amateurism. I finished the book only because I wanted to know more about E. coli, but I couldn't wait for the story to end. This is not good writing."
2,Only interesting aspect is meat production info.,"I read this 1/3 of the way, and then just skimmed ahead to read about the description of the slaughterhouse and how beef is produced for consumers. Otherwise I had no interest in the storyline at all. However, this is not Cook's fault. His storyline was about a egotistical, stubborn surgeon. His character did not interest me at all. The reason for this, though, is because I have met many surgeons in my life and I have found them all to be just as unappealling and snobbish as the character in the book. So, to me it seems as if Cook did do a good job portraying the surgeon, but I am just put off by people of such a nature."
2,Cook turns out sour dish,Good idea gone awry. First 150 pages were sluggish. Middle was better but the ending stunk. Characters did not stay consistent thoroughout the story and many aspects of the story were implausible based on how the characters were written in the first 100 pages. Good idea with poor execution. The last 50 pages got silly.
2,"Robin Cook, you are getting tiresome","I am growing quite weary of reading Robin Cook's expose on managed health care. The first half of the book dwelt on managed care and that a physician's daughter should get preferential treatment in a hospital emergency room. Dr. Cook, welcome to the rest of the world and face the problems the other 99% of the workforce faces---layoffs, long waits in doctor's offices, etc."
4,"A good, entertaining story!!!","The suspence level was high in this one. The description of the slaughterhouse made me never to want to walk into one. And now I examine my burgers a little more closely, even though I don't know what I'm looking for!!"
2,so-so novel,This book could have been better if the ending wasn't lousy. It's like the author cut it short and we don't know what happened in the end (story was not 100% completed like a cliffhanger). It's like Hitchcock movies and you have to figure out what happened to the end of the story. I'm kind of disappointed because this was not as great as other Cook books I have read.
2,PREACHY WITH A SOUNDTRACK,"IF YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO HOW POOR UNDERPAID MDS ARE HAVING TO DEAL WITH BIG BAD MANAGED CARE AND LISTEN TO AN ANNOYING SOUNDTRACK TO TELL YOU WHEN SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING, THIS IS YOUR BOOK--I'M A FAN OF HIS OTHER BOOKS BUT FORGET THIS ONE; AND THE MUSICAL ADDITION--WHAT'S NEXT-A LAUGHTRACK?"
1,Big disappointment,In my book it's a daughter not son that dies???? It doesn't seem to matter in the end. Starts out great but soon becomes too contrived and totally unbelievable. A hired killer that hangs around to tell the good Dr he's mad at the people that hired him??? One thing I did get from the book.....make mine well done!
3,An intriguing albeit flawed novel....,"Being my first book by the author, I have to say that I wasn't impressed. The suspense is cheap, predictable and the main character acts very unrealistically. However, set aside these minor niggles and you will discover the darker side of the corrupt meat industry. The book can be very exciting at times and the character development is very good. There are a few punches in the book which make you sweat and your heart miss a beat.Suspense in a bottle but nothing special. Give the book a try, however and you'll find yourself in for a moderately good read."
2,Thank you for purchasing my personal agenda - R. Cook,"I thought Dennis Miller ranted! Ha! I truly expected more from Cook. In the end I concluded that I could have written this book. The outline for TOXIN must have filled almost an entire cocktail napkin!The end of TOXIN was not only a complete let-down but unexpected from a writer of Cook's stature. I would recommend avoiding TOXIN and finding something better, an old newspaper perhaps.BTW, the second star was for Cook's other works."
1,Stilted dialogue -- preachy throughout,I think Robin Cook got impassioned by the subject of food poisoning and decided to make a statement. Good message. Poorly delivered. The dialogue was forced and stilted. His dialogue usually flows better than that. Not his best work.
2,Holds Your Interest But Definitely Not His Best,"Like most of Cook's other books, Toxin holds your interest throughout. However, the story becomes less and less credible as you get further and further into it. Although fast-moving, I'd recommend you spend your time reading something else."
1,A Big Bucket of Suck,"Reading this book is like watching paint dry. Though I must admit, I haven't eaten a hamburger since..."
3,Sick But Fun,"After reading this you won't eat hamburger for a long time.When a doctor's daughter gets sick from eating hamburger that was undercooked, he goes nuts. On a rampage, he fights with the medical association as well as the meat industry that poisons his little girl. As he goes undercover in the warehouse, what he sees, the handling of the food and what actually goes into your Big Macs, my gosh I'm getting sick thinking about it.My only gripes - it dragged a little in some parts (I do admit to a short attention span though), and I wanted more out of the ending. I was kinda like ""okay...and?""Overall I recommend this book. It's very interesting, as some of it is supposidly based on various facts about how meat is handled."
3,beautiful actual book.,the sunject is a very actual one. Robin cook has avrey good way to write novels.
4,Gripping from cover to cover,I have read many of his books and none made me as nausous as this. Truly superb. I think I will become a vegetarian!! Does the reporters daughter have it now???? A sequel maybe?
4,"Had potential to be a great book, then Cook left us hanging.",Toxin was very exciting and at times made me totally sick at my stomach. I have made sure since reading this book that all my meat is completely cooked. I just wish Cook would have not left us hanging at the end.
3,Great book with a terrible ending,"Toxin is the seventh Robin Cook book I read, and it is also one of the best. When I picked this book up I could not stop reading it until the horrible end. Toxin could have had at least two more chapters. It left me feeling like I picked up a incomplete book!"
1,Most unbelievable book I've ever experienced,"Besides using exaggeration to the point of absurdity (eg, Americare's unwillingness to treat patients in anything but a robotic, uncaring manner), Cook has not the faintest idea of how parents react to the loss of a child. I have worked in a hospital for over 5 years - I deal daily with the Managed Care fiasco AND families in grief. There was NOTHING realistic about either of the many scenarios he presented. The only reason I gave the book 1 star is the description of meat processing - I am again a vegetarian."
2,should've been a non-fiction,"Toxin is not a very good book. What starts out, seemingly, like another Robin Cook thriller quickly turns into a rant about managed health care and the beef industry. There's also several gaps in the story, like he started writing it, got bored and left, then came back later and started forgetting where he was going the last time. The ending sucked. There was no finalty, to wrap up, not even something to think about it. Shortly into the book you're left scratching your head about the characters. The main two, Kim and Tracy, don't act like typical parents, or any of the other situations where you'd expect normal people to act...Toxin is a scary book. You'll stop eating (hamburgers) for a while. Cook makes really great points about managed health care, the USDA, and fast food in general. Just think it might've read better had Toxin been a non-fiction book about those subjects than trying to slop some half-baked fictional story around it..."
3,Mediocre reading but gives ideas for follow up reading,"Robin Cook's Toxin was a fairly mediocre novel in the sense that the writing seemed less organized and choppy and the characters less developed than one would see in a great medical thriller. The bonus that comes from reading Toxin, however, is the topic of food preparation and food-borne illnesses. The author recommends the book ""Spoiled"" at the end, and after beginning to read that there are a lot of other questions that have arisen in my mind as to how safe the preparation of meat is, and how have I (being partial to rare meat) not gotten any diseases yet? So, although the story line itself is slightly weak, the thought provoking qualities of the book improved its rating."
2,Cook builds to disappointment,"I have been a fan of cook since reading Mind Bend and Acceptable Risk, but toxin was a let down to say the least. I was compelled to read it because of the nature of the subject- e-coli and the meat industry. I was interested at first, but as others have stated previously, there is no ending. Cook leaves the readers hanging to no end, and they must conclude for themselves what happens. It's almost as if he didn't want to waste his time with the end once he got his main point out in the open. Hopefully his next will be better..."
5,O.K. -- this reviewer cheated,"I haven't been into contemporary rock in *years* but, I metAnnette at her day job and was blown away by her awareness andenergy level. I asked whether she was an actress, and she saidno, she was a singer with Shut Up Marie. So, I got the CD andwas blown away again. I have her on my desk with Olivia NewtonJohn and Linda Ronstadt, but, when I really want someinspiration for my own creative projects, I listen to the SUM demo."
5,Good Show.,"Bob Dylan performing with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers on their 1986 tour. Great sound and well directed concert video filmed in Australia. Dylan is in top form as he delights his audience with a greatist hits show and the Heartbreakers produce a dynamic wall of sound sure to satisfy any fan.Good set list including ""Knockin on Heavens Door"", ""Like a Rolling Stone"",""It Aint Me Babe"", etc.Recommended for any Dylan enthusiast."
5,brief and funny,"The book is one sentence long. I won't ruin it for you but Rosie takes a walk (past, over, under, through) and is completely unaware of the what is going on. The fox...poor fox. No chicken for the fox.The drawings are exquisite.What I like most about this book is that it is PERFECT for a toddler that doesn't really want to listen to a long story but wants a funny book. Because of the detail you can take the time to find things in the book (grasshopper, fruit, flowers) so the book can take 20 minutes to read OR if you are busy mom with babies to attend the book can take under 2 minutes and still be entertaining and funny.So far this book has been a win win for both of us."
2,"32 words in the whole book, bit slow for a 3year-old","Someone in another review mentioned how much their 4-year-old enjoyed this book. I can't fathom how that is true. There are only 32 words in the entire book, and I can see how a very small (barely verbal) child (say 18-30 months) might enjoy it. But there's no way it's suitable for kids that are talking fluently.Also, honestly I don't know what was going on with art in the late 60's, but that mustard/brown palette had to go (think shag carpet). It's not a terribly pretty book. I was pretty unimpressed."
4,Eisler is a fantastic writer...,"This novel is not quite as strong as Rain Fall was, but the story is a good one. The stakes are high, but the payoff is a bit smaller. We will be fighting Yamaoto for another day. Still, Rain is a fantastic character and Eisler an oustanding writer. He is much better writer than many of fellow authors in this genre. This story lacks a bit of the depth and context of the first, but remains fascinating in descriptions and Japanese politics. Will Rain ever find peace? Must read the next to find out!"
5,Hard Rain: A Must Read!,"Hard Rain more than fulfills the promise of Rain Fall, the debut novel by Barry Eisler, that Publishers Weekly named a Best Novel of 2002. Hard Rain is a taut, suspenseful, and rivetting read, and protagonist John Rain, the half Japanese, half American assassin who specializes in death by 'natural causes' gets even more under your skin in this second novel. Rain is one of the most complex, multi-dimensional, and memorable characters to come along in a long time. Eisler's strong female characters, his evocation of a dark Tokyo landscape that one can almost see and smell, and his chillingly realistic action and fight sequences make this a powerful thriller that shades off into the literary at times. This book is a must read both for fans of the genre and for readers who crave a thought-provoking, suspenseful, intense, well crafted novel!"
4,John Rain rocks,"Somehow, Barry Eisler not only avoided a sophomore slump with his second entry in the John Rain series, but he actually made the second better than the first. It felt like he was more comfortable writing it, like he was a bit more confident of his abilities. In the midst of the action there were some excellent descriptions. Really enjoyed it"
5,A great summer read,"Hard Rain is a terrific sequel to Eisler's first novel, Rain Fall. John Rain is an intelligent and insightful character who manages to bring a code of ethics to the dark world of political corruption and assasination. He is the consummate professional who is so good at what he does that he can't escape it.I read the book in two days - can't wait for the next!"
2,Disappointed,"This author has such great reviews from the Amazon reviewers, which I can usually trust, but I found myself starting to skip pages about a third of the way through -- so it just must be me. It seemed to me a great portion of the book dealt with the descriptions of John Rain performing his SDR's (surveillance detection runs)through the streets of Osaka and Tokyo. I felt like I was reading a travel book. The action scenes just didn't make up for having to slog through his scenic narratives."
5,Jason Bourne move over,"Move over Jason Bourne. John rain is back! More cunning than Bourne or many other ""hit men"", this half-American half Japanese misfit dazzles us once agin with his meticulous tradecraft,and his uncanny ability to make his stealth murders appear as death from natural causes.In Hard Rain, Eisler gives us further insight into the psyche of his cool killer, John Rain. This protagonist's motives, as well as his angst, are well developed and wonderfully presented. Eisler's descriptions of Tokyo are acurate almost to a fault.John Rain is a cunning killer. His life as a freelance assassin is perceived by Rain, both as a source of personal pride as well as the etiology of his painful isolation. In time he could easily become the new iconoclastic character of this genre of novel.If your looking for a good read, Hard Rain is it."
3,Sequel Syndrome,"'Hard Rain' is to 'Rain Fall' what 'Die Hard II' is to 'Die Hard': not much character development (what more could one say about such an unlikely lead), but a lot more, and a lot more graphic, action (of both the violent and sexual varieties). Eisler does attempt a kind of justification of our hero's vocation, by way of its (a)moral equivalence with other kinds of socially sanctioned killing; and also explains that he just happens to be one of that two percent of the population who have been blessed/cursed by nature with just the right psychological profile, so it can't be his fault, can it? The political intriguing which provides the opportunity for Rain to display his talents are this time a little more contrived and convoluted, and consequently considerably less convincing, but Eisler's evocative descriptions of central Tokyo have again caused me to look anew at my current neighbourhood.Still a good read, but perhaps a change of scenery is called for in #3?"
2,I must be missing something,"I found this book to be average at best. While the plot and characters are thought out fairly well, I found myself yawning and my mind wandering through much of the book. Eisler has a ways to go before he can measure up to the likes of Robert Ludlum or Dan Brown."
4,Tokyo - As You've Never Seen it Before,"Hard Rain is a good action book that traces the story of John Rain, a one-man-killing machine, as he helps clean up corrupt Japan and the hard-core Yakuza involved. The book's scenes were entertaining, as well as some of the characters. I especially appreciated the Japanese-Brazilian Naomi character as a realistic portrayal of the ever increasing Japanese-Brazilian population in Japan, as anyone who has been there in recent years could attest to. The best part of this book, however, is not the actual story itself (although the story is enough to keep you interested), but the beautiful depiction of Tokyo as a living city, ever changing, yet staying true to its Edo days. Tokyo and its 23 wards played a real part in this story, and I tip my hat to the author for making the world's largest city come alive."
3,Acceptable Sequel....,This is book 2 of the John Rain series. The first was fun and I recommend you start there. This one is acceptable but breaks no new ground. That doesn't mean it isn't a fun ride just not as fun as the first.
5,Eisler RAINS supreme,Intricacy written smoothly. No detail is omitted and you feel the pain when Rain does! Then you feel his victory and appreciation for persistence!!!
5,Rain Man,"Fast paced, very entertaining. These books should be made into movies. I will definitely read more of his books (I'm on my third one)."
5,Couldn't put it down,"Eisler is a wonderful story teller who has created a unique character in John Rain. Believable, original, seductive - this is no cookie cutter assassin. Rain is an introspective, intelligent and compelling hero. Fortunately, I began with the first novel in the series - ""Rain Fall."" I recommend reading them in order as the cast of characters grows in depth with each new novel. So does reader enjoyment.A wonderful and engaging set of thrillers."
4,Interesting Thriller,Nice use of the foreign culture. Probably should have started with the first one. The politics become central and he's kind of pushing it there. Certainly wouldn't work in a movie. More like one of the tv shows that is co-financed by several different countries like the Highlander.
5,Hard Rain is hard to put down!,"I enjoyed this book very much. Eisler does a great job of blending detail with convincing characters and good story telling. Well worth a read. Mr. Eisler, you've got a new fan!"
4,*** Proposition****,"Front back cover:Gannon Elliott never expected to become a father just to hire an editor for his magazine. But the billionaire had been bred to compete and win, like all in the Elliott dynasty, and now to win a challenge, he needed the best - his ex-lover Erika Layven.More than anything, Erika wanted a baby, and the way she saw it, Gannon, who'd ruined her for any other man, owed her. It didn't matter that his green eyes drew her like a bee to honey, that his killer bod put sinful thoughts in her head. She'd simply draw up a contract and treat him like any other business deal. But Erika made one fatal mistake. She underestimated Gannon's charms....I like Leanne Bank's writting style. This book was a great and a fast read, the begining of a new dynasty. I like the book because didn't have a big family dilemma. I was able to enjoy the romance. My favorite part the end, but you will have to read it. I won't tell you. Enjoy"
4,Potty Training,I purchased this toy to potty train my daughter. She immediately grasped the concept of potty training after watching the doll use the potty. It made the transition easy.
2,Get sick to this,"I didn't like it when I bought it, and I still don't like it a couple months later. This record simply isn't MOb, sounds like the pop garbage on the radio. Just shows what money does to people's brains. Probably see them doing a sprite commercial pretty soon, just like Mos Def... sad thing."
5,Dungeon Family for 2000 on...................,"This album is the prelude to the future of the dungeon family. None of G Mo-B's positive message is lost on this album...if you actually understand the lyrics...They're coming from the view of 28-29 yr old men...Who live for real..they're ""Ballin"" on a level of total awareness, because ""they ain't no dummies,they ain't bout to die about it""....Better Get It....true Platinum!"
4,Not as bad as I first thought...,"When I first heard this CD, I was disapointed because I was expecting another ""Still Standing"" and this is clearly not it. After listening to it again a year later, I found that I am really startin to dig this CD! For anyone who said it was disapointing, I encourage them to listen to it again."
2,One Word~Disappointing,"I can't quite put my finger on it, but this album pales in comparison to the previous M.O.B.'s. I guess this cd is better than a lot that are out right now, however, I was highly disappointed in it. That's why I only gave it 2 stars. I have just about every song on Still Standing memorized...it still sees significant play time in my cd player but I just dont see that happening with World Party. I guess all I can say is listen to the whole album before you buy."
3,Why?,"Goodie Mob was one of the last groups left in hip-hop that actually had meaning behind their music. On Soul Food and Still Standing, there was a positive message that left the listener feeling good. With the exception of one or two songs, that message is gone. What's worse is the message it's replaced by. Not everyone needs to be ""thugs"", but on World Party the Goodie Mob wants to be thugs. I don't know why. Compared to most hip-hop today, this would be a 4.5 star album, but knowing what could and should have been, it gets 3. I'll just keep listening to Still Standing and hope the next one is back on track."
3,I'm about to cry,"This is a dark day for Goodie Mob Fans Globally. My boys from the ATL, have been lost. What happened to the Goodie Mob I used to know? they've been replaced by some cookie cutter beats that eclipse the maning in their lyrics (if there still is any) I guess I still call myself a GMoB fan, but i'm still hurt."
2,Junk,"This is totally cheap!***THIS IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO A NIKON FLAsh! ***It does not seem to have real TTL (thru the lens) pickup with the camera (D200) So it works just as a flash with its own sensor. If you want a cheap extra flash for backup, this would be ok. But it does not have the features of the true Nikon flash. It is also cheaply built in comparison, and mine did not even come with instructions! (not from Amazon)If you want real Nikon flash capability - get the real thing. IMHO."
5,Sigma EF 500 DG SUPER,"got this from Amazon for my D50 nikon works great, free shipping!Get one or two for remote use."
2,Never quite worked right for me,"""Liquid Paper DryLine Mini Correction Tape"" sounds like a great idea and when it works, it works well. It instantly covers up mistakes (or anything you don't want people to see) - there is no need to wait for it to dry. It also covers things up more quickly than regular wite-out, it covers them up better (nothing leaks through), and you can cover up more things in a shorter period of time. Unfortunately, for me it worked well for a short period of time and then it stopped working. The witeout tape stopped dispensing and ended up getting tangled up inside the dispenser. At first I thought I had a defective dispenser but I had the same problem with every dispenser in the pack.""Liquid Paper DryLine Mini Correction Tape"" is a nice idea but it never quite worked right for me."
2,Covers the mistakes but only if you need to make one line.,"This product is OK. It does cover the ink that you are trying to hide, but if you need to make more than one line (say the mistake is thick/wide and you need to make two lines on top of each other), the plastic with catch what you already put down and pull it up. Not high quality -- doesn't compare to PaperMates Liquid Paper Dry Line product at all. Will not be ordering again."
3,Experimental Design Techniques,"Any serious student of factorial experimental design techniques should definitely read this book. It has a level of detail and sufficient explanation to move any practionier's competence along to the next level.This book, however, is a bit too technically oriented for the begineer."
3,"Good, but long","Good series and filmed well. My reason for giving 3 stars instead of 5 are:Though title is Wing Chun, the series only contains about 25%, maybe even less, directly realted to Wing Chun or Martial Arts in general. The rest is like a soap opera drama. Though interesting series, if you are expecting all Martial Arts this is not for you.Also, it is too long. Just goes on and on and on. They could have condensed this series into about half the length and it would have been much better.Good sets and takes you back in time to 1920s China, though how historically accurate I do not know.Again, would be a great series to watch if it was much shorter in length."
3,Sure are a lot of ads!,"My main impression is that the book has as many ads as a magazine. I picked ten pages at random and six of them had ads. It does seem to be a reasonably good cruising guide, and many of the ads are topical, but some information is sparse, e.g., lengths of suggested walks or hikes ashore is missing. But the book does include much information."
4,Excellent cruising guide,"This is the third cruising guide that I have purchased for the VI over the years, this one lives up to my high expectations for content and relevance."
3,"Darn good, but a lot of ads...","This book certainly covers the basics and is handy to be sure. The spiral binding and compact size make it easy to mark up and dog ear on those cold winter nights when you are planning your trip, and throw it in the suitcase when you finally get to go. One downside is that there are a lot of ads for a book that is not all that inexpensive. I guess I am used to ads subsidizing magazines, but for some reason it irks me just a teensy bit in a book. You may also want to check out the Russell and Benzel ""Exploring the Virgin Islands"". This is nice as it can be helpful to read a slightly different perspective - though it has the same pros and cons as the Scott book."
4,Great information,The guide covers all the information you need for a wonderful sailing experience. We've mapped out our ideal float plan but also have identified alternative anchorage for each night just in case things don't go as planned. The guide details many provisioning locations and other necessities throughout the area so you can supplement as needed.
4,Cruising Guide to the Virgin islands,"A good cruising guide to the Virgin Islands. Possibly a few more ads than I would have liked , but I guess it is all information which helps on a holiday. The binding of the book is quite secure and can be carried well on the yacht."
1,idiotic company selling magnesium oil as a liquid supplement,"this product tastes exactly like magnesium oilthat's because it is the same.I believe the strong taste is from the chloride - other ionic mineral companies don't include the chloride in their productsIonic magnesium by other companies seems to taste okay, not this brand thoughfind another ionic mineral company who know what they are doing"
4,Excellent basic book,"This book, unlike most judo books available today, contains full color photos in an attractive format. The book contents are as modern and accurate as the design. Although geared primarily for beginners it covers a lot of material that anyone doing judo needs to know.Watch for the next book by this publisher which will be a more comprehensive text with the same excellent format."
2,This series was ok,"I agree with most who say this anime is appropriate for an 8 year old. This anime didnt even keep my attention in episode 1. The plot of the parents switching spouses and living in the same house felt so unreal it was just rediculouse. The romance between the boy and the girl Miki felt completely confused and contradictory despite these other obstacles of other guys/girls interrupting their budding romance. It has it's entertaining moments but nothing that kept my interest for long. I had to take this back to the store and decided to Buy another title which I am hooked on now..""Boys over Flowers"" NOW that anime is so passionate and wonderful I wont go into much detail here. But to me Marmalade boy is definately not worth buiyng. Try renting first to see if you like this first."
5,Great Little Portable Player,"Bought this for summer trips, camping etc. For the price quality is excellent, battery life acceptable, and it comes with all the accessories you could need. Volume isn't great, but OK and you can attach two headphones.Totally happy with the purchase!"
1,Out of the Box Failure,"Plugged this in with great expectation on Christmas morning only to find that the screen would go black after about 30 sec of playing a DVD (with the audio still running). Given other reviews of unit failure, poor quality control and equally poor RCA product support I would not take a chance on this model."
4,"Good, with a slight reservation","While it took me a little while to get into the book, I did find that enjoyed it quite a bit. I did have a small issue, though.I was not a fan of the abrupt changes from character to character. Each chapter had at least one, and it was very distracting to start. I was able to get used to it, but I don't know if it was an overall benefit to the book.I did like that the book kept the serialized form and didn't try to make larger chapters from the material. It kept the story moving and allowed for quick changes in story lines (in a way that wasn't disruptive)."
4,Italian Paralell text,"I'm a true beginner at italian, and this book has been quite helpful, because the translations are quite literal and the stories are pretty straightforward. It contains a story by Italo Calvino, who is amazing, and I was thrilled to read one of his stories in its original form! I would say, though, that since it was compiled in the 1960's , the stories aren't as modern as I would have liked."
4,Good Aid to Learning Italian,"I find the book a great help to my self-study of Italian. The translaters stick quite faithfully to the original text, and the stories are short and varied to sustain the readers' interest. I have no regrets getting the book."
2,Italiano,"The book is not as advertise - ""for learning Italian."" It is relatively advanced, especially in its use of passato remote."
5,Cool & Rewarding,"An original Rumi addict I admit to being, & I got into Hafez on that path. Now there are, by last count, about 30 different translations in books & on Internet pages, & this is one of best 'cause it sings & also can be understood. But it's more, much more, than just the poems. It's one Persian woman's guide to making poetry a powerful part of her worldview and life. Cool, cool, rewarding on lotsa levels."
5,A Deep and Thoughtful Work,"At a time when Persian poetry is being revived, this book offers a deeper and more thoughtful look than most at how the original thoughts and feelings of one poet, the great Hafez of Shiraz, relate to the contemporary world. The whole presentation is just beautifully done, a work of both the heart and the mind by the two co-authors, Haleh Pourafzal & Roger Montgomery. The translations ring true, more Persian-sounding than most other translations but freely enough rendered so that they're not obscure to modern readers. As a whole, the book is just a wonderful spiritual trip in itself. Set aside a lot of time to read and re-read this one."
4,Great Sandal...,I bought these for a trip to the Riveria Maya. They are very comfortable. Easy to get on and off. I wear them after work and on the weekends. They are true to size and very comfortable. The toe tends to run warm but I imagine this is true to all closed toe sandals. They are slippery when wet and makes it easy to lose your footing. Overall these are great sandals.
1,BOOOOO!!!!,The Sole of the shoe is coming off at the heel. Wrote to Keen and sent pics. And I will update this review depending on their response. I had them for about three months. I was hoping they would last for three years. Keen failed me!!!! I was such a believer. now i'm crushed.
3,Episodes not playing,Two discs watched so far. One episode on each disc does not play. Hopefully this does not continue. Thank you
5,Does anyone know if seasons 2-5 are complete and not edited?,"Before I purchase any Gomer DVD's, I need some help.I noticed the individual seasons 2-5 for purchase do not say complete, however in the whole collection season 1-5 it states complete seasons 1-5. Does anyone know if these are in fact complete? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you"
5,Blast from the past,"Gaw-aw-ly! These DVD's are the complete 5 seasons of Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C. We have laughed together as a family while enjoying the fun antics of Gomer and Sergeant Carter and all their friends. Shazam, there is even an episode with Carol Burnett! She is funny, too!"
5,Wonderful clean comedy!!!,"Such a great series. Humerous, laugh out loud family fun. I am very pleased with this purchase. Our family loves this!"
4,amazon great job!,"Dear Folks, I love to shop at Amazon. I was recently injured and unable to walk for 10 months; still have trouble walking --so shopping is difficult. Thanks goodness for Amazon where I can sit in my chair, shop for quality products, and have them delivered to my door. Especially helpful as it's Christmas time and I have 8 children, plus some spouses and grandchildren.Thanks again for your good work!"
3,"NOT a CD-Rom, but a good music CD","I ordered this expecting what I consider a cd-rom, perhaps pictures of the sheet music, explanations/instructions for the student, something other than just music; however, this is not the case. This is just simply a music CD. In that respect, it is a fine CD, as it allows our daughter to hear how the Suzuki songs should sound on the cello, but be warned, it is not interactive."
4,"""FIRE"" is ""HOT"" like *HAMZAH*",IT'S A VERY GOOD C.D.! I ENCOURAGE ANYONE WHO HAS NOT BROUGHT IT TO DO SO. KEEP UP THE GOOD HARD WORK!
1,Doesn't work as represented,"What a rip off. Unreliable:schedule a program to be recorded and don't count on it; moreover, when that happens the DVD becomes unusable for future recording. The so-called commercial advance NEVER worked on any of the recordings that I was able to make; and, yes, it was properly set up to do that. The whole unit ""seized up"" 2 or 3 times, when I had to unplug and then set up again (fortunately their were instructions for that ""possibility""). Consequently, I have a machine that effectively functions only as a DVD player"
3,Commercial Advance,"+ Commercial advance works great+ Had no problems with DVD+R media- Was able to record only once on +RW, but would not finalize nor playback.- Fast forward if painfully slow. Maybe 4x max. or you can manually skip forward 30 seconds with a button. But press the button very often."
2,"One step foward, one step back","As an owner of an earlier RCA DVD Recorder (DRC8040), I had high hopes for this one. RCA gets points for supporting Divx, commercial skip and HDMI out.However, this model is missing features and has a couple bugs. My biggest gripe is that RCA removed the ""Split Title"" feature which is a useful way to perform basic edits and to free up disc space. Also, the title screen doesn't always display correctly when playing finalized discs in other DVD players. Lastly, it seems to prefer +RW discs as I constantly got errors trying to record to plain +R DVDs.I would suggest looking at LG's line of recorders, or last year's Sony GX315."
2,Huge Disappointment,"I ordered this unit and Amazon, great as ever, delivered in under 24hrs (shipped from adjacent state) with just super saver free shipping. Unfortunately, the unit was running scorching hot after about an hour of use. I felt behind and found the fan wasn't working. I double checked visually and could see the fan twitching ever so slightly but not actually running. I am currently packing it up to return to Amazon. Shame, the unit seemed like it was solidly built and worked good on the two discs I tried on it (Memorex RW+ 2.4x and Ridata RW+ 4x). Due to other poor reviewes I decided not to exchange and hope for a good unit. Even with the fan not running I think this unit should not have been running so hot; it was uncomfortable to the touch. Heat is the enemy of electronics. I doubt this thing would have lasted more than a few weeks of use."
2,Was good while it lasted,I had problems with this unit as soon as I got it. When it did work It was great would copy other DVD with no problems but after I had unit about 6 months the sound quit on unit so I sent it back for repair but they were unable to fix it and eneded up giving me a cheap dual VCR DVD player to replace it.
4,Thank You!,"I am participating in both the Seattle and San Diego Breast Cancer 3-Day events this year. I purchased this paper to write thank you notes to my donors. The paper feels a little thin (only reason I did not give 5 stars), but it works well for the letter. If you are participating in a walk or are just passionate about the battle to find a cure for breast cancer, this is great paper to use."
5,Andre Rieu and his orchestra are supurb performers!,"If you can possibly obtain this video, you will watch it again and again. I viewed this concert and his other works on our local PBS channel and they are all excellent! I recommend it highly."
3,Huh?,"I'm one of those esoteric flakes who has always thought that TJL was one of EC's best kept secrets. So, obviously, is Kerry-Anne Kutz. So would it not follow logically that I should record my own version of TJL and then shop that bad boy around the more esoteric record labels within the greater Boise metropolitan area? No? OK (sigh)...."
1,Hard to believe,"I gave the author the benefit of the doubt for most of the book, but when he claimed to have seen bigfoot, it makes the rest of the story hard to believe. Seems more like a charlatan to me."
5,Call of the Great Spirit:,"I totally enjoyed reading this book. Bobby Lake-Thom gave us a wake up call to return to the old ways of our ancestors. He provided us with the knowledge of the Creator's Natural Laws, which some have forgotten or no longer choose to follow. He gives us examples of what might occur if one chooses to ignore the laws. And how a Native Healer can aid in returning a person into balance.He shows us the path of the Native Healer is not an easy one. That it demands sacrifice and discipline. Those that are chosen by the Great Creator for this work will under go testing and trials to prepare themselves for their path in life.Many today are seeking out the Red Road and Native American spirituality. This book will give you insite into these ways."
5,Best I have used,I have one nail that splits often. I started using this product about a year ago and have not had any problems when using this product since. I have tried others and they have not helped.
1,dissapointing,"I've various used Sally Hansen products with mixed results. However the claims for this product are totally unfounded. This product did not protect my nails in the least. A simple bump results in splts and breaks even when my nails are down to the nubs, as they are now.I have always had great nails- my one vainty. I used to depend on S.H products to keep them that way. Not this one, and as a former user I am no longer going to spend money if the products don't keep their promises."
1,Didn't do what it says!,My nails have been really damaged lately due to me constantly applying nail polish on. My nail started pealing and chipping really bad. I thought this would keep my nails healthy as a base coat. It says it strengthens and helps nails stop from peeling. WRONG. My nails still look the same.It's like a top coat feeling and i feel like it doesnt help my nails grow at all.Nutranail 5 to 7 Day Growth Aloe Formula .45 oz.Use this instead if you want your nails naturally strong instead of having a film over them.
4,not sure yet,"i haven't really seen much of a difference with these, my nails are the kind that peel off and this hasn't seem to make much of a difference, i'll keep using it though.."
3,It's all right,"Daisy Chain's Straight or Lame isn't a masterpiece but I think it does fit into Sundazed's category. It gives off the flower power like charm that many of their collections deliver. While the songs do tend to lead into too many different directions, there is a garage feel to it. It's not really rocking. It's more mellow.Besides it is neat to see what Rosemary Lane was doing before Birtha. Her vocal on Got to get you in my arms gives a glimpse of what was to come. In my mind Run Spot Run makes it worth the purchase alone, good tune with trippy lyrics. Now I just wish that Sundazed would release The Cake's albums."
5,A Thoughtful and Interesting Discussion,"I read a lot of management books and I'm not easily impressed, but Security Transformation is a very good read. The authors have taken an issue that on the face of it seems arcane and dull, and woven an interesting and readable narrative that details the impact of information security on a company's brand, reputation and bottom line. Worth picking up."
1,where is the description?,where is the description??and what is exactly in the box?how much weight?model of motor?and everything about the product please !!!!
1,Terrible,The so called 'code' in the book of Daniel is nothing more than a bunch of unintelligible gibberish. Stick with the 'forward' text and don't waste your brain space.
5,Great songs with a great message!,This music is an inspiration for all of us. His music shows us how the Holy Spirit can work through an individual. Thank God for this son of His' music.
5,My girl loves it,I got her Miami Glow for a late Vday gift she loves it! I got Live Luxe By Jlo coming in tomorrow for her as well.
2,Miami Glow by JLO,"After seeing this fragrance on clearance I decided to try it out. I really expected something more from J.Lo, not this fragrance. ""Miami Glow"" smells like baby powder - litteraly. Wasn't even worth the $10 I spent on it! Save your money!!!"
2,"Eh, a little stinky, not tropical-y, and mobile version doesn't not state NO returns!","I'm a little disappointed with this product. I was expecting a feminine, tropical scent. Everyone described it as summery and fresh, and even soapy so I figured it'd be clean, tropical scent. To me, it's none of these. It's a sweet musky scent and smells almost manly. It reminds me of JLo's Deseo, which had sweet and tropical top notes but smelled like a man at the end of the day. Ick. Not for me. On top of that, it's not returnable which is NOT stated when you order it via the mobile version of Amazon. I won't be buying perfume again via Amazon!"
4,Smells Great,"This product is another gift I purchased for my wife, and it smells great. It has a nice fruit tone to it, so it gives off a sweet vibe when worn. My wife's only problem? It is no longer in production. Oh well, we will keep purchasing it from here until we find a great replacement."
2,ARRIVES STALE EVERY TIME,"Have ordered this several times, and while a really good product, it has arrived stale each time. Never have found an exp. date on the bags or the case, except for a code#; but I don't have the code book. World of difference from those purchased at the grocery store. Really wish they would ship dated product to amazon. It is not amazons' fault."
4,My son loves it!,"My son wanted an RC car for Christmas, but we felt that was a toy that would end up collecting dust quickly. He is a bright child that loves to build things with Legos and is interested in how things work. This toy is both in one. He has tried different combinations with the circuits and enjoys seeing what works and what doesn't. He also received another snap circuit toy for Christmas and loves it as well. Big thumbs up for this toy!"
1,It's a bust,"This is the third snap circuit setup I've gotten for my boy, and the prior experience has been first rate. With this one, the plastic controller battery housing requires opening a door affixed by a philips head screw, which stripped in the attempt to install the first battery. So I'm stuck. For $[...] they should be able to find a screw that's made of something other than aluminum and installed by someone other than an arm wrestling champion. This gets an F each for design, assembly and materials."
5,5yr old birthday present,I purchased the Snap Circuits RC Rover for my nephew's 5th birthday and he loves it. The company delivered it quickly and had it on sale for a great price.It's not as tough as some of his remote control trucks (ie. it doesn't drive off of steps without losing circuits) but he loves changing the circuits around to create different effects. Another great product from the Snap Circuits company.Overall this is a great toy for a child who likes to build things and see how they work. I would highly recommend this toy to friends.
5,Snap Circuits Rock!,This is a great toy for kids who like to to construct. It's a great alternative for a lego lover. It's also well made and the instructions are clear and easy to follow.
5,Great toy!,"I also purchased the Elenco Snap Circuits Jr., and also loved it. They're both fun, educational, and DURABLE-- nothing cheap to break the day after Christmas. My 9 year old son needs no help with these toys, and as an added benefit, we now have an electronics unit for homeschool. :-)"
1,Absolute Disappointment,Buyers beware !I bought the RC Snap Rover from Amazon for my son this Christmas. Imagine his disappointment on Christmas day when he and his sister put it together and found that it did not work. I consoled him as best I could and sat down to try the advance troubleshooting circuits to check what was wrong. Finally found out that it was the motor control IC module that was defective! Even before completing the circuit as shown on the advance troubleshooting guide the wheels start revolving on their own accord. I tried calling Eleno's customer service number several times but just keep going in circles getting no one to speak to and not even able to leave a message ! I am surprised that a company like Elenco Electronics has such poor customer service. I am extremely disappointed with this product especially as it is so expensive. What a piece of junk !
5,"Great toy, even for younger kids","My 3-year old loves playing with this kit. We've been alternating between assembling and disassembling the Rover at least several times a week before he goes to bed. It's become a part of our quiet time/sleep routine. I am directing and doing most of the assembly process, but he loves calling out the types of parts and snapping them in place. Once the car is assembled, he takes a turn with the remote control, though still has trouble getting wheels on both sides moving at the same time.He also quite enjoys breaking the circuits apart. We then sort and replace the pieces into their proper silos in the box, which teaches him shapes. I am also trying to teach him numbers by talking about the number of attachments on each circuit. I am very surprised and pleased by the amount of use we are getting out of this toy, particularly given the age of my son."
2,A RERELEASE TO BOOT!!!!,"There are times EVIL LIVES works as a parody of itself. I mean here we have an aging Tristan Rogers (Days of Our Lives) playing some kind of demon worshiper whose wife died 600 years ago. The only way he can continue to have her is to kill women and have his wife inhabit their bodies for about three or four hours, and then he has to kill more. Farfetched, but original!! However, most of the acting is unusually bad, including Tyrone Power Jr. as hunky cop Scott. Dawn Wells (Mary Ann from GILLIGAN'S ISLAND) has a whopping one minute scene!!!! Julie Strain porn queen supreme is the first corpse....anyway, the movie plods along at a predictable pace and the ending is so out of nowhere, one can only wonder why Griffin O'Neal agreed to be in it!Not as bad as it could have been, but not all that good either!"
1,Title and Box Cover Misleading,"This DVD is a perfect example of misleading advertising. The title and box art have nothing to do with this amateur film. There's nothing new here and the acting is horrendous. It was probably a made-for-TV bomb...then again...that's being too nice. This one is a stink bomb. Nothing scary...no gore...definitely nothing evil, except the deceptive promoters that mislead me into buying this. 1 Star is being generous...LIGHTS OUT!"
3,Good B rated thriller,This movie is good if you area a Tristan Rogers and a Tyrone Power Jr fan. Worth watching for them.
5,Excellent,"It's a shame that this book isn't more available to the public, as it has been a great help to me in understanding how my years growing up are influencing me now. I'm taking the offensive and gaining understanding and liberty with the help of this book."
3,In case you can't read the contents from the photo...,"This compilation contains:* Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven* Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor* Might and Magic VIII: Day of the Destroyer* Might and Magic IXOn a total of eight CDs in a cheap paper folder. Note that this collection overlaps two games with the previous ""Millennium Edition"" collection (IV-VII).Also included are:* A map with The Land of Enroth (VI) on one side and Erathia (VII) on the other* A map of The Land of Jadame (VIII)* A map of The Land of Chedian (IX)* Installation instructions on the paper CD folder* No printed manualsThis is labelled a ""Value Pack"" for a reason. If you want the most games for your money, don't mind reading or printing the manuals from the CDs, and don't like to pay extra for packaging, this collection fits the bill.I can't say anything about the four games themselves, since I haven't actually installed them yet."
2,WinXP problems when games says it is XP compatable?,"I'm sorry, but when a game says it is WinXP compatable, but you have to modify it to make it run on XP, then it isn't compatable.I had 2 of the original games, and had to do a lot of work to get them working. I can live with that with the originals. But I got the platinum version because it implied that it worked, out of the box, with XP. It doesn't.To the reviewer that said that you can troubleshoot it, why should we have to?Since just about everyone is using XP, stay away from this, unless you like messing with it. Even IGN sites don't have a ""this will make it work on XP"" patches or fixes.Great games, if you can get it to work. If you aren't computer knowledgable enough to get them going without worrying about grabbing virus laden programs, stay away! I have it 2 stars, because if you can get them to work, these are great games."
1,The 3do mystery,"You know, I was about to purchase this compilation tonight, just for the simple fact that I can't get the games that I have ALREADY BOUGHT to work on my winXP setup. Then I decided not to.. Because I already own ALL 4 of these games, and 3do has dissappeared off the face of the planet.. Why should I give MORE of my money to a company that won't even support the games it already has.. How do I know that a year from now windows won't upgrade to WIN 2006 and the games won't work again.. I've had it with 3do, that is no way to run a company.. You can't just disappear, yet still produce new games.. Grrrr.."
2,Dont bother if you have newer XP,First off all of these are great games but if you have XP with any newer updates the games except 9 and sometimes 6 will not run 8 is almost imposible and most the patches dont work and youll spend a week editing the game files to make it play 7 has a patch u can get it to play with about 4 hrs of patients and alot of extra downloads running in the background but you wont have sound with service pack 2 trust me if you dont know alot about editing and patching and making virtual drives and stuff like that this is not for you i just keep an old pc with 98 and an old voodoo card and it runs good on that
4,Might and Magic Platinum Edition,"This is a great product if you are familiar with the might and magic series at all. You can spend hours playing and not get board. Lots of quests and skills to perfect. I have not played might and magic 7 through 9 yet, but Might and Magic 6 has been pretty good, however you do need to find and download a patch for this game or you are likely to not get any music working with it.[...]"
4,"great game, crap tech support","i remember how great these games were, so i bought the millenium edition, not worrying about the XP problem, since several people posted solutions right here. Too bad none of them are working for me so far. I can get the Install screen to come up, but clicking on 'Install' simply closes the window and nothing happens. Not even a freakin error message.THANKS 3DO!"
1,Stopped reading the book,"Made no sense...too far out there with ""mythical"" characters. Waste of money. I wish I could get my money back."
1,"Good Book, Poor eBook - Full of errors-ruins the pace of reading","Eric Lustbader is one of my favorite authors. I have been enjoying the Pearl series on the kindle, but this transcription is so full of miss-spelled words, missing letters, and just wrong characters (the number 3 in place of the letter a - How does that happen??) that you can't enjoy the story line. Your mind gets hung up on the errors and you get pulled out of the story. Some sections are so bad that there are errors every few words.Who is checking the kindle content before it is placed for sale?Bottom line. Read this one in paperback. Don't bother with this ebook.Amazon - I hope you refund me the money or send me the paperback instead."
4,d'gramma,"I bought this book as a gift for my 14 year old granddaughter. I always read the books I buy for my grand children, to ensure that the content is really age appropriate. This is the 2nd book in the series & it continues very nicely from where the 1st one left off. And, like the 1st book, it kept my attention clear to the end, when everything is tied together and/or resolved."
2,Huh?,"Van Lustbader can spin a good sentence, but the overall feel seems overly ambitious and hollow. There is just enough ring of falsehood to all the underpinnings of this world--the fakey science, the half-baked cultural explanations--that it left me with a feeling of cheese all over my skin. I am glad that there are those who enjoy his work. It shows a lot of effort and imagination, and for that I give him two stars. But overall, it feels oily to me."
3,Not my bag.,"Not a bad series but not really up my alley. If your a sci-fi fan you'll like it, but fantasy probably not."
3,Our galaxy needs better proofreaders...,"An interesting read, a facinating concept. Various sf writers delve into aspects of ""Farscape,"" from a ""NASA memo"" that reprimands Crichton for tarnishing Earth's good name in distant parts of the galaxy, to essays that compare Zhaan to several different ancient Earth goddesses/myths.However, the book's publisher needs to hire a real proofreader, instead of relying on (probably Windoze's) spell checker. One writer calls D'Argo a ""Luxan,"" another, a ""Luxon."" On page 49 there's a quoted line of dialogue I'm sure must be a typo. A British writer gives a ""new meaning"" to the TV jibe of ""jumping the shark"" -- no, it doesn't mean the consummation of two characters longstanding attraction; the phrase comes from an episode in ""Happy Days'"" waning years, in which Fonzie (at least, his stunt double), on waterskis, indeed ""jumped a shark"" in a desperate attempt to lure viewers back to the show. Most ""Farscape"" fans would agree that the show never ""jumped the shark."""
1,Highly disappointed...,"Frankly, most of these ""essays"" didn't grab my attention. I was bored throughout this book. I thought it was going to be a nice walk through the past of one of my favorite shows - some stellar insight into what made Farscape great. But all I got was a lot of prentention, a lot of ""let me show you how smart I am"" prose. A waste of money."
1,Terrible Crackle,"Gutted the stock system in my Maxima and replaced everything: Pioneer AVICF700Bt head unit, Zeus components, Pioneer components, 2 sony 600W amps and 10"" Kicker sub in sealed box. Initially used this pioneer set for the rear doors to match the Pioneer Components in the front. There was a terrible crackle. Contacted Amazon for a no hassle retturn w/ vendor. Ordered Zues components for rear doors. The ZEUS worked and sounded much better. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THESE."
2,speakers,"i just have a basic pioneer radio, one of speakers already torn, just from basic use..i don't even know if i have warranty on it or not. it sucks, i replaced both with another set so far so good."
5,Organized Crime Study.,This is a very good series for an Organized Crime class or study program. Students will find this material useful in understanding Organized Crime and faculty will find this useful to illustrate their lecture material.
4,DVD Movie Review,This two disk set is a must have for those interested in the movie's subject. Well prepared and presented for all viewers to understand.It's on the lengthy side and this is to be expected for this kind of subject matter. You should have this movie in your movie library.
3,Informative and intriguing,Interesting and informative. I've always been interested in the workings of the mob and this documentary explains the history in a very easy to understand way.
2,A botch!!!,"The CD of BABY BOOMER CLASSICS: MORE MELLOW SIXTIES shuffles the playing order of theoriginal 1985 LPand worst of all, replaces its best song (IMO) with ""Oh Happy Day"" by the Edwin Hawkins Singers.Must be some sort of politically correct nonsense at play here.The original closer of Side One, ""Israelites"" by Desmond Dekker and the Aces (of UNI Records) is a delightfully infectious ska track. ""Oh Happy Day"" by contrast... is not.The other songs here are great, no question. My two-star rating is for the publishers' unconcern for leaving a fine playlist unjumbled and intact."
1,CD Cover Does Not Match Content Below!,If you buy this CD you will get the following songs: 1-Up Up & Away/2-Daydream Believer/3-Monday Monday/4-She'd Rather Be With Me/5-You Belong to Me/6-Suspicion/7-Chapel of Love/8-You Were on My Mind/9-Guantanamera/10-Angel of the Morning/11-Raindrops/12-He Will Break Your Heart/13-Poetry in Motion/14-Little Help From My Friends. Be sure to look at the Back Cover Image before buying.
2,Good shoe...but.....,"There's one major flaw with Bostonian square toes - I have three pair so trust me when I say this: you can't find inserts/insoles for them. The shoot fits snuggly and comfortably, the backs don't wear out and cause pain to your heels, but the insole goes flat in less than a year and you'll be donating the shoes as there's no way to find square-toe inserts; Bostonian says they neither make nor can suggest where to find square toe inserts."
4,Chase scenes,"My wife was a ""military brat"" in Honolulu when this show was in production. She and her girlfriends used to like to go down to the filming to watch. The chase scenes, she says, were the most interesting because there's nowhere to go on Oahu so they would just chase around and around the block. A member of her church, Lowell Larson, was chosen to be a stand in for James MacArthur, Detective Danny Williams (Dan-o). The ""Police Station"" they used was the `Iolani Palace."
5,Outstanding 70s drama at its best!,"Good stories, good acting, good directing. No gross effects. Great soundtrack. Come on, it doesn't get any better than Chin, Che Fong, Danno, Ben, Kono and even Steve himself!!"
4,Harold & Maude,This is a quirky classic that we just had to add to our collection. Great soundtrack (Cat Stevens) and lots of funny moments.
4,harold and maude,"Great movie, a classic dark comedy about strange ways of love.Save your money and get Netflix and watch it with anytime.$60.00 for a DVD,get real................"
4,Great movie about LIFE,I love this story about a guy who has spent most of his life thinking about death until he learns a powerful lesson about life.
2,"A bit didactic, don't you think?","This movie spends way too much time teaching us that life is meant to be loved, lived, and enjoyed, which is, let's face it, an extremely old, hackneyed and boring lesson. If I want a lecture I'll go to school; a sermon, church."
2,quirky,This story is purely 70's...It's about a neglected rich kid seeking attention and an old lady that notices him.She shows him how to look at the world instead of thinking only of himself. She giveshim the ability to 'live life'. It's very quirky and I wouldn't recommend it for those that want a 'fun' entertaining film. It's not my idea of 'entertainment'.
3,...,"this movie was ok... it was pretty funny at times, but in my opinion it was lacking in some major parts. the acting was good but they didnt really do anything ever, except stealing cars and commiting suicide... finaly this movie was pointless i do not reccomend it even though it was ok... go see a better movie like HITCHHIKERS!!!!"
1,Not for me!,"While we like quirky, funny movies, just could not get into this one. It was just too odd and dated for us to enjoy."
2,Are we rating the same video?,"I'm sorry that I have to go against the grain here; I love aternative movies like the best of them, but this was just too weird. Life-affirming, I suppose, but it gave me a sick feeling. Faking the morose deaths, attending funerals for people he doesn't know, and the teenage boy being with a 79 year old woman (it's been awhile, I'm not sure if she's 69 or 79) is just too much. The PG rating should be stronger. I felt a weird sensation in the pit of my stomach after watching this movie. But, if you're going for ultra-weird and kinky, you would be well-served to watch this movie; it does have its merits."
1,Is Great!!,Is a colt movie but is a funny movie these 2 people go to funerals for recreational time is great!!!!!!!!!!
5,Quite simply the most charmingly quirky movie I know,"On the face of it, a movie about a suicidal teen who develops a semi-romantic attachment to an ancient woman seems about as ""niche"" as you can get, but don't overlook this film. The relationship between Harold and Maude is truly endearing, and is as heartbreakingly dear as it is comedic. Through Maude (Ruth Gordon in a role that will forever define the agelessness of the human spirit) we get a truly unique perspective on life, told in such a gracefully sweet way that we cannot help but fall in love with her. If you like Igby Goes Down (a modern interpretation of Catcher in the Rye) you'll get much the same feeling from Harold and Maude, which is not so much a ""coming of age"" movie as a funny-but-deep look at love in all its splendours."
5,"I agree with all the above, but I have a question:","Does anyone know if there is a video version in ""letterbox"" (i.e. original theater aspect ratio). I'm sure the ""pan and scan"" misses a lot, and that's the only version I found, even on laser. Will it be released on DVD?"
5,Unforgettable...,"In the same way that John Denver was a perfect match for the Muppets, so too does the music of Cat Stevens match the spirit of this film. The combination is unique.I know that's a bit of a weird review, but then again, this is a bit of a weird film. And, I hope you are now motivated to check it out."
4,Living it up in the 70s,"Harold (Bud Cort) is 20, Maude (Ruth Gordon) is 79 and a concentration camp survivor; ironically he is obsessed with death, she with life. They meet at a funeral (he loves to attend them), become friends, and she begins to ""instruct"" him about the joys of life. In retrospect some of these lessons are difficult to swallow today and represent subversive activities that were often mistaken for ""freedom"" back in the early 70s when the movie was made: much of what Maude tries to instill in Harold constitutes doing whatever you feel like doing, especially bucking authority and the law. It's no wonder it became a college cult classic at the time. The funniest parts of the picture are those that show the ludicrous mock suicide attempts made by Harold throughout the proceedings. If you are of a certain age and feel nostalgic for the ""let it all hang out"" days of the cultural revolution circa 1971, you will probably enjoy this movie."
5,One of the all time great movies.,"Harold and Maude is one of the greatest coming of age movies of all time. It tells the story of a disaffected young man and the relationship he develops with a Nazi concentration camp survivor. In the process he learns that he can develop a relationship with himself and the world at large as well.I didn't find it particularly black, it certainly has a great sense of humor, a bit eccentric at times but not all that dark.Harold and Maude is one of the all time great movies, I recommend it highly."
5,a perfect flavor for my taste,"actually, seeing Harold and Maude for the first time waaay back in '72, when i was 17 and just getting into what would become a life-long love of movies, it may have helped create my taste in movies!in all honesty, this may be my all-time favorite movie. music by cat stevens, so perfectly suited to it's time, also serves to tie the film together. the fact the location shots are all in parts of the san francisco bay area i grew up in probably had an unreasonable influence, too!it is one of those movies every line of which i can recite as i watch....it is worth it for Harold's mom's character alone! she has the best lines in the whole thing.as to the squeemishness some have evinced regarding the 'may-december' relationship....by the time harold was in love with maude...so was i!!and i have been ever since."
5,My Favorite Movie,"Harold and Maude is a classic! It is a beautiful, twisted love story, a life-affirming black comedy. Both Bud Cort (who can be seen briefly in recently released Dogma and Ruth Gorgon are superd. The score, all by Cat Stevens,sets the perfect tone. This is a not-to-be-missed classic."
5,Smashing: Propels us to live with full abandon!,"It's in a class by itself! As a 28 year old ethnic female, I have yet to find another that reaches into my soul and affirms the innately human need to live...Simply live! The message is clear, the love is genuine, and the humor is dark. Intelligent matching of script, acting, and music (all performed by the former Cat Stevens) make this film my eternal favorite."
5,Everyone Loves This Movie!,"I think the reason there are so many five star reviews for this movie is that everyone who sees it loves it and everyone who loves it loves it A LOT! Harold and Maude continues to be one of the very best movies I have ever seen. I try to recruit people to watch it with me, but many are turned off by the premise. DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF NOT SEEING THIS MOVIE!"
5,Even BETTER at $89!!,"I initially thought what a lot of people thought: this price must be a mistake.But I went ahead and paid it anyway, and found that I actually enjoyed this movie 8 times more than the $10 DVD I'd already bought.It's inexplicable but true! This 89er is identical in every way to my cheapo H&M;, but when I put in the 89er, the plot is just more fascinating. The ideas bolder...The originality and zaniness sharper and fabulouser!I've done blind comparisons with friends and they all agree. I blindfolded and deafened three random viewers and 1 senior citizen (for control) and had them watch each one, not telling them which was which.Each independently agreed the 89 dollar Harold & Maude was up to 7.7 times greater than the lesser priced item.So pay extra, people! You get what you pay for. BELIEVE!!"
5,Too Funny!,This film still holds up after 30 years. Only Monty Python's Holy grail and Blazing Saddles made me laugh more than this black humor masterpiece.
1,do not buy this,this dvd is foreign and will not play on american dvd players. You can't get a replacement dvd either just a refund minus shipping. RIP OFF DO NOT BUY
2,Not Funny,"I was really disappointed in this CD. It reminds me of the psychological happenings like in the sixties and seventies. Cat Steven sings the songs through out the movie. If you are looking for a Dark Comedy, this is the one."
1,will not go back,The movie will not play in the USA unless you have a European disk player. Kind of felt vamboozled because this was not expressed at purchase. Will not be returning.
2,Loser From the 60's,"It's 1971 folks and the evil Richard Nixon is the President of the United States. A time capsule really, H & M tell us that our parent's aspirations: financial well being, a stable home life, love and security are all pathetic middle-class aspirations unworthy of modern children. An 80-year-old, concentration camp survivor on steroids, Maude, Ruth Gordon, must teach the lesson.The 60's makes less sense to me now than ever. Good riddance!By the way, the film is dull and pretentious."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"there's about 10 minutes of written content in this film, the rest is filling in space. do we need to see 15 seconds of the policeman getting off his motorbike, putting the kickstand down, and walking over to the car? the way it's edited seems like they struggled to reach feature length. as for what content there is, in terms of drama the characters and plot are relatively underdeveloped and in terms of comedy what may have been original in 1971 seems cliched today."
5,One of my favorites,This movie gave me a big taste for black humor and b movies. I laughed my butt off! The story is very touching and quirky too. It was a gem of the times.
4,A gift for my granddaughter,"My granddaughter picked this out as one of the old movies that she wanted in her collection, I know she'll enjoy it."
1,Amazon VOD changes aspect ratio of the movie,"Love the movie. Unfortunately Amazon VOD changed the movie to ""Full Screen"" and cropped the Film from its original aspect ratio. There is no clear warning that this will happen until you buy the movie and it's too late."
3,H&M,It was a very bizarre and strange movie! It hada strong 60's attitude. It did have a really coolCar in it!
5,One of my Favorites of All Time,"This story is about an usual love between an eighty something woman and a twenty something man. Our heroine is not a cougar per se, but a real, loving woman who has a beautiful spirit and unconditional love to share.Harold is a rich boy who finds very little to live for before he meets Maude. If you like unusual love stories or dark comedies or cult classics, this is a movie for you. I love it. Power Path to Love"
5,Harold and Maude,"This is in my top five of all-time favorite movies, if not number one! It has all the elements I love in a flick: dark comedy, (peculiar)romance, and a great soundtrack."
1,Sheep!,"Everyone does love this movie- and I don't know why. And I mean *LOVES* this movie. It isn't that great, it's highly overrated. The best stuff is the different ""suicides"" that Harold comes up with, after that it's just this eccentric old lady doing crazy, wacky things.And that's why people love it, the wacky grandma. Man, that's always an easy way to get laughs or whatever, it's like throwing a little red-headed girl into a sitcom that's lost its edge. The wacky Maude appeals to the lowest common denominator within this ""cult"" genre. She's a tool to manipulate your viewing, it's not good filmmaking or good storytelling. It's really not that good, rent it, don't buy it."
4,A perfect blend of life and death,"Harold and Maude may be about a young man and an old woman falling in love, but its true message is that of freedom. I love this film. It says that life is a chance to try new things, to experiment, know matter what the conventional wisdom is. Cat Steven'd song states it perfectly: if you want to be free, be free.kcrosby1@bellsouth.net"
5,"without a doubt, the greatest movie ever made...",mere words cannot describe this film...watch it once and you will instantly understand why we are all gushing...
3,Maybe I need to watch it again....,"I had been hearing about this movie for a while and was always told that it was one of the greatest love stories ever. I'm sorry, but I just didn't see what all the hoopla is about. I found the movie to be entertaining and funny(although one scene in particular really should have just been left to the imagination, I won't say which. It'll give away too much). Maybe I expected too much? Maybe I'm from the wrong generation (born in '76)? I just wouldn't call this movie a great love story. Overall, it was OK."
3,"Close, but no cigar...","The film is a worthy cause gone astray. One knows that Harold's baby-face charm will not be enough to sustain the film, and adult supervision is urgently needed. Maude comes to the rescue, changing the tone of the film for the worse. Maude is grossly over-acted. The self-indulgence in the acting of her character makes the idiosyncracies of Harold's death wish look almost monastic. The story, like that of many films made in the 70s, is too self-righteous to be taken seriously. The writer and the director like Harold and Maude so much that they run off the tangent in terms of plausibility. The failure of the film is a pity. Our over-organized life badly needs an antidote promised by this film. The problem is that a promise is all we got."
3,Different Kind of Movie,"It's an older movie - and it's different. I enjoyed it for the most part, but wouldn't list it as one of my favorites."
5,Never better!,"""Harold and Maude"" is my all time favorite movie. It is a cult film. I saw it in theaters 36 times! Back in the day, theaters would show it at midnight like they do for Rocky Horrow nowadays. Anyway, this movie tells about life. It says something about being young. It says something about being old. It says something about living a HAPPY life. I think we all can learn from this.Ruth Gordon is my hero. Budd Court is the boyfriend I never had. I love them both. All this coupled with a Cat Stevens soundtrack. I am in heaven! I love this movie!Sheree Renselwww.wizzlewolf.com"
3,"Original, but not a strong story","I saw all the hype for this movie, so I rented it. Although it is original and offbeat, that isn't enough to make it great. The story (what there is of it) is sloooooooooow. There were some laughs, but not enough to keep me very interested. It was worth renting once, but I won't be buying it."
3,Am I the only one who didn't think this movie was wonderful?,"Although I found this movie funny (the scenes focusing on Harold's ""deaths"" in particular), I didn't think it was appropriately labeled. To this day I always catch myself being confused when I see this under ""comedy"". Maybe it's just because I saw this movie for the first time in a psychology class when we were learning about social disorders, but I didn't catch myself rolling in the aisles for most of the movie. Don't get me wrong, this movie is definitely worth seeing, but not if you want to see a hilarious movie."
1,How disappointing,I was very disappointed when I tried to watch this video.It seems that in Australia we need a different format than that of USA or Canada.I now have a useless DVD which will cost me more to return than it is worth. Please send me your comments to ednallewellyn@hotmail.com
1,DVD doesn't work; Seller won't respond,"DVD won't work. Says ""Not authorized.""Did not specify at different system in product description.Tried to reach Seller twice but no response."
4,A True Delight,"This movie is just as good as, if not better than I remembered it! It's funny that a movie which takes such an odd look at death can be so life affirming. It makes you feel really good. Maude gives us all permission, no, encouragement to live full out. I love it! I tried to give 5 start but the computer wouldn't let me."
4,Quirky but sweet!,Just a sweet movie. Love the dysfunction that is treated as normal throughout the movie. Great dialog and an innocence you don't find in movies these days.
5,It's a Hit!,"I first saw this film in the 70s and have loved it ever since. It is so unique and funny a story. Furthermore, the casting of Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort was genius. I love showing this to friends who've never seen it. It's a hit!"
5,Ying and Yang perfection,"Colins Higgin's simple premise and Hal Ashby's subtle direction, coupled with on-target performances illuminates the brilliant use of irony that is lacking in cinema today. This perfect ying and yang; a young man who has everything,status,wealth and youth is obsessed with death. Contrast him with a woman in her twilight, faded beauty, no visible means of support, living on the fringe but she is obsessed with life. If comedy is derived from conflict then there is plenty of it in this film. I can't urge you enough to watch this movie. It inspires me and makes me laugh.PS, also look for the visual metaphors, like ""Perma Seal"" on the coffin or the daisies to tombstones sequence. Powerful stuff!"
1,"too old for ,me",same old story- liked the first one better (actors)I really dont think I orderd this- got two of the other one
4,A sleeper,"Harold and Maude is a sleeper. I never saw the movie or heard of it when it was released back in the 70,s. I first viewed it about three years age and have now viewed it 3 times. Ruth Gordon is great and she doesn't overplay her part. She also was superb in Inside Daisy Clover but the critics hardly mention her. Watch both of these movies and then go back to The Actress starring a young Jean Simmons and a wily Spencer Tracy."
5,A Brilliant Must-See Film!,"I also agree that this film is one of the best life-affirming films ever made. What I love about it, having seen it several dozen times since it was released, is how powerful some of its most brilliant moments are. One of my most favorite (and haunting) is the quick glimpse we get of the numerical markings on Maude's arm as she sits with Harold. No further explanation is needed into why Maude celebrates life that way she does."
4,Undiscovered Gold,"Harold and Maude is such an underestimated, not well known film. When I first saw this film, I felt as if I'd discovered something that had been hidden for years and years. There are several aspects of this film which could appeal to just about any movie watcher out there. This film is full of dark humor, historical fiction, love, identity crisis, rebellion and several other things. Great film."
1,NEVER name a movie with a verb,"This is a movie that DOES make you flinch.It's THAT bad.Gina Gershon,who had dubious fame for being in ""Showgirls""&had; a brief role in ""The Insider"",stars a ""living mannequin."" When she&Harry; (Judd Nelson,FINALLY playing a good guy for once)witness a murder,a whodunit is afoot.This movie is engrossing because it's soooo bad.It also introduces a new type of villain:THE EVIL SCULPTOR!"
3,"Good, but you have to work","I view this book as a good bridge between theory an application of Linear Robust control design. I see the authors as intentionally staying away from the bowels of the theory so as to not bog down the engineer who is looking to apply the techniques covered. Sometimes the depth of the theory involved dissuades the engineer from applying this powerful tool.It's too bad that the book wasn't updated to coincide with the release of the Matlab RCT v3. However, every example in the book still works as all of the legacy commands that they are written with are still supported in RCT v3. In fact, it was an excellent exercise for me to convert the examples for use with the new RCT v3 syntax. Running the same examples with the old and new versions of the toolbox provided valuable insight, and was an excellent learning experience."
3,Doesn't cover spectra 1.5,"This book didn't meet my expectations. To start, the UI of the webtop in spectra 1.5 has been considerably modified from 1.0 in a number of areas. The book examples often don't match up with the new UI. Second, the book seems to be cobbled together without much cohesion. Trying to create the sample app has become a contest to see if you can figure out what they want you to do. Since there aren't a whole lot of books out there on spectra, this may be your only recourse but don't expect too much."
4,"Informative, but w/ errors","This book was definately needed in the world of Spectra. I think that it was very helpful to the majority of Developers that have read and used the examples.But, there are quite a few mistakes throughout, and seemed somewhat rushed. I can't wait until the next book comes out!"
1,Please!!!,"Are we to believe this poor victim was forced out of law enforcement because he was always right and the department or system was out to get him at every turn? I guess the Grand Jury, the Judge and the trial Jury were also out to get him. When, by his own admission he couldn't follow the judges' instructions. But by reading his book we are to believe poor Marcus was and still is a victim. He obviously cannot take criticism and always looks to blame someone else for his own problems. But, never himself!"
1,He will be in prison for the next 25 years!,"This guy is in prison for his awful ""sex"" crime against a child. Do you people still think he knows what he's talking about and he's such a GREAT guy? Don't believe me. Call the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in Huntsville, Texas."
1,The truth,Anyone can look up this guys history on the internet. I know him personally and I would not recommend the pages from this book for my dog to use.
5,Impressed and Better for It!!!,"I found this book and just had to see what all excitement was about. This Author should be on the ""NewYork Best Seller List""! I got a ticket, followed his programs and got it dismissed! His knowledge and genuine approach for story is very gifted! Hope to see more from this author."
2,not so interesting,"I bought it to give it to my son's class, but there is very little info about the animals they were studying."
4,"Not for beginners, but excellent work!",This book is definitely not for Photoshop beginners; it assumes fairly extensive knowledge of Photoshop 7 and does not waste time going over application how-tos. Instead it is a fine series of challenging projects to expand the range and capability of serious graphic designers and Photoshop-users.
1,Mastering Book Store Squandering - Primer Course,"In this course we will learn how to look at a book quickly, evaluating its content for intriguing tutorials, and continuing to purchase the book at a bookstore for $50 to improve one's photoshop skills.Then we will proceed to take one evening of pizza and Photoshop to realize what a waste of $50 said book was.For our final, we will sell book only to find out it is worth four dollars everywhere, and end up giving book philathropically to local library."
1,Worthless,"I found this book at a local used book store and at first it looked like a great deal. I found the first exercise difficult to follow because some steps have been left out. The second one wasn't much better and I became frustated. At first I thought it was me, but when I looked it up on Amazon.com I discovered that everybody was having trouble with the book. That's when I threw my book into the garbage can.Next time I'll read the reviews at Amazon.com before buying a Photoshop book!"
3,"Pretty book, but not a good text","The book is very artistic, but it would be unreasonable to assume that one would learn a real lot from it.I liked the exploded views of all the layers at the beginning of each project, as well as the visual list of source files.I haven't tried to work through any of teh projects, beacuse just reading through the book, I can tell the instructions are not clear."
1,This is something to stay away from,"this skips more than a peppy schoolgirl who is high on pot. i hope i proved my point there. the sound is also awful, and it eats your batteries like a peppy schoolgirl eats candy. i hope i proved my point there. don't buy this, or any sony product for that matter, unless you can grow your own money and waste it"
3,"Flawed, Like It's Anti-Herione","I can understand viewers feeling affection towards this ultimate underdog with her plucky spirit no matter how unhappy things seem. However, this abrupt, loud style of filmmaking never has and probably never will appeal to me. I see it as a ""energetic life on the margins"" movement that would be refined later by Godard's ""Breathless."" Fellini tackles serious subjects in a too self-consciously clever way."
4,one of the great characters,"cabiria is one of the few truly great female characters in film, right up there with swanson's norma desmond. my only quibble with this film is that masima sometimes goes over the top in her portrayal of this gutter girl. the great accomplishment of the film is that it doesn't succumb to the obvious sentimentality it would be all too easy to fall into. to show a prostitute with the heart of an angel is really an achievement, when you think about it."
5,Nights of Cabiria,"In this bittersweet, poignant early feature from Italian maestro Fellini, Giulietta Masina (who was married to the director) brings off another demanding role with finesse and charm. Her Cabiria is a spiritual innocent thrust into the least innocent of professions, making her desire for meaningful companionship seem unattainable. Through it all, Masina radiates a plucky dignity that makes us root for her. Note: ""Cabiria"" is more grounded in realism than Fellini's later works, but this hardly detracts from the film's sizable emotional impact."
5,"a $100.00 for a new copy?!!! Well, it is one of the greatest movies i'ver ever seen!","i saw this movie at film school and as soon as it ended, i stormed out the room, completely enthralled by the movie. people thought i hated it but the reason why i left was because i didn't want to hear any discussion from wannabe intellectual film students. i didn't want anyone to ruin my enchantment with this film becuase it was one of the greatest film i have ever seen (up there with lawrence of arabia, apocalypse now, ran, touch of evil, blade runner) except the epic thing about this film is not the cinematography but the actress' performance. if you are an actress and you want to see the greatest female performance off all time, watch this movie! i fell in love with her, not her looks but her spirit!"
5,Fellini's Oscar winning Movie!,"""The Nights of Cabiria"" is one of Federico Fellini's masterpieces. The DVD quality is outstanding. Bravo to Criterion Collection for releasing this amazing movie."
5,Brilliant and beautiful...,"i've never really been much of a Fellini fan, but i happened upon this film a few years ago, and was stunned at the sheer beauty of it.Fellini's tale of Cabiria- a saucy, hard-as-nails (but tenderhearted) prostitute yearning for a better life- is beautiful, brilliant, stunning, heartbreaking, and simply exhilarating.it is impossible to be let down by this perfect work of art.Guilietta Masina is absolutely WONDERFUL."
1,Clouded by hatred of Irving,"Professor Evans's broadside against David Irving just will not fly. Not that Irving is completely right on each and every point he has made over the years. But Evans is not really a historian to match Irving's indefatigable researching and presentation skills. He commits numerous errors, makes statements that were long ago discarded by more modern historians of the Holocaust. Yes, Irving lost his (in)famous--and perhaps unwise---defamation suit against Deborah Lipstadt; but the verdict was a Pyrrhic victory of sorts. True, Irving's books soon ""disappeared"" from various libraries and bookstores, but his essential worth as a historian of the World War II period remains significant, even if it is not acknowledged as frequently as before ""the trial."" Like Sir John Keegan and Professor Gordon Craig, if you are going to study that period seriously, you MUST study Irving. Not so Evan...."
3,I miss the NWA,Stuff that is copy-protected from the 1980s is just a drag. How else are we supposed to transfer this stuff to DVD?The show is not the greatest. Typical Dusty finishes and whatnot. I got it for the Midnight Express/Jim Cornette vs. Rhodes/Magnum/Baby Doll. It's even funnier in the rearview mirror.
1,Very unprofessional,"I was not happy with the 5 heartbeats, I found the cast in the movie vulgar, and vain. I didn't get a since of making good music from the 5 heartbeats, .... The cursing out of fellow heartbeats in a public setting also very unprofessional, and classless. The other glaring problem was I believe their 1972 concert (completely unhistorically correct, someone didn't do their homework) done with drum machine synthesizer music, not real instruments with real musicians, as was the custom of that period, and not the [inexpensive] cookie cutter synthesized, drum machine music we've learned to tolerate since about the mid 80's. I give the 5 heartbeats 2 thumbs down."
2,Heartbeats missing a beat,The Five Heartbeats is an awesome movie. I had seen it several times and loved it but did not have the dvd which is why I ordered it. Much to my disappointment the movie has scenes that have been cut. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!
5,Best movie that you can add to your collection.,This is definitely something that you should invest in for your dvd collection. It is an awesome movie and a tear jerker.
5,my Second Favorite Movie,"At first when I saw this movie, I was a little disappointed. Let me explain. I had been watching the Temptations movie faithfully when someone suggested that I watch the Five Heartbeats as well. Thinking it was going to be like the Temptations, I went ahead and watched it with high expectations. (Also, it didn't hurt that Leon was also in this movie.)After I finished watching this movie I felt jipped. Honestly, I had expected it to be exactly like the Temptations, only with different characters. But when I thought about it, I realized that this movie had came out about 7 years earlier, and it wasn't ACTUALLY based on any actual musical group. Once I got over this, I realized what a great movie it was. I even cried when Jimmy died, and again when Eddie took a turn for the worst. Even though I don't watch it as much as I watch the Temptations, rest assured that this movie too, is in heavy rotation at my house."
5,one of my all-time-favorites,"I love this movie. If you're into classic soul music, then you should watch this movie. I wasn't there, but I think the things that happen in this movie, probably happened to almost every singing group out there. Also, the soundtrack is pretty good too.."
4,Near Great,"This is a fine movie about the rise, and fall, of some of the super black rock groups in the 60s and 70s. It also shows, but kind of over-simplifies (I hope) how the white,squeaky clean groups covered a lot of the material and made out with big bucks. I will always remember one of the early scenes where Michael Wright's character Eddie, the lead singer of the Heartbeats, barely escapes a violent card game and comes running and sliding on stage to join the Heartbeats in an on-stage competition. But there could have been a lot more music and a little less sub-plot ---sex, racist Southern cops, etc. And the final scene----why on earth couldn't the movie show the members actually singing once again when they got together? But it is a great effort and you will enjoy it. I love the music so, that I wanted this movie to tell it all. But it told a lot."
3,The Five Heartbeats 15th Anniversary Edition,"This is one of my FAVORITE movies of all time! I purchased this DVD because I only had the VHS version...and who plays VHS's anymore? Anyway, can you imagine my disappointment when I popped in this 15th anniversary edition and some of the most important scenes were cut out of the movie? It was like watching a shadow of the original. I will be re-purchasing The Five Heartbeats DVD...and this time, I'll make sure it's the regular DVD, not the chopped up anniversary edition. It cuts the heart out of a GREAT movie."
5,FANTASTIC,"Although it is a work of fiction, it closely resembles the story of the Temptations. It was superb! The music was awesome. The story line tight. The acting was outstanding. I would highly recommend to everyone. Definitely a must have in your movie collection!"
3,Duck!,"I don't know which movie I liked more? The Temptations or The Five Heartbeats???? But this is a great, fun movie. It's more of a movie with a cult following. I gave it only 3 stars because my favorite movie of all time is the Godfather, and the only two movies who will ever get 5 stars from me are The Godfather and The Godfather II."
3,My mom likes this movie,"I don't really care too much for it personally, I only gave it three stars cause of my mom, I think the reason I didn't like it was cause my sister and mom watched it like a ritual so it got boring to me. It does have its good moments though I'll admit that."
5,"""always loved it...!""","I haven't opened this and played it. I bought it as a keepsake. I loved what I saw on TV years ago and ""assumed"" this was the same. all the credits are exact.I'm sure when I get time to watch it, I'll be happy!"
5,Love it,Ive been watching this movie since it first came out im not gonna ever not like it its the best movie ive seen
5,A great movie!,"Everyone in this movie was great! After all of his HBO Partners In Crime specials, Robert Townsend continued the good work with this wonderful film. Tico Wells, Harry Lennix, and Townsend himself all turned in fine performances but you have to love Michael Wright in this one. His ""Eddie"" was heartbreaking and believable! If you're a fan of films about music groups making it to the top, you have got to see this one! A gem!"
5,"A classic up their with Cooly High,Cladine,Sparkle,Car Wash","I can remember when I first seen it from beginning to the end my mouth was open this and the color purple were the only movies that made me laff,cry,sad,than very happy all in two hours and also send chills up my spine like when they were doing the talent show and they took over and then eddie was blowing and ask the crowd is their a heart in the house tonight stand up 'I stood up and said yes over here"" and started to stomp my feet and clap my hands like I was at a concert.Now that didn't really happen but I wanted to,that's the kind of movie it is. It was a very good movie.If you love the motown sound and want a little history on what price black act's had to pay for stardom then here is a little history for those who like a good movie with alot of good music,and a lot of spirt you will love this movie."
4,MyZon,"The items I purchased on the Obama website were pretty much of what I expected except the Men's Tie. It was not what I expected in terms of quality and style.. It wasn't clear on the website and when I received it in the mail, I was most disappointed that I had purchased it. I am looking to return it immediately. The other products met with my expectations and I have referred these items to other friends."
5,Romance and exciting history of Scottish highland masterfully blended!,"This author's first novel literally had me spellbound!Not only is it a fascinating story of mesmerizing characters but it's set in one of Scotland's most dazzling periods. Then it moves into England's notorious seaport of Bristol during the slave trade plied by greedy merchants. Can't decide which part of the book I enjoyed most - the Scottish highland adventures and flight or the perils faced by them in England. This is a fabulous read and Margaret and Jamie's romance is suspenseful. The author does not concentrate on just her two main character but succinctly develops other liasons and romances so beautifully that you care about them too.No time travel theme here, gratefully. If you want a book you can't put down, this is a must read. The only downside is that at the end you want to follow their lives so badly but that's coming in Marilyn Grant Halls' sequel ""Tartan Passage"". Let's support more new writers of her talent!"
5,A great read for parents of gifted girls.,"Since there are no books or schools dedicated to raising kids, we need all the information we can get. My intuition has been my best resource for raising my gifted daughter and Dr. Kerr's research has reinforced those ideas I've used, but for which I've had no support. If you've done much reading in the gifted area, you know that the age of the research is not an issue. Even though this has a 1985 copyright, the outcomes will stand through time. It is a quick read with a vast and lasting benefit. Read it and see what you think."
2,Dont buy this....-Jult Warfell,I liked some of this story but not all of it. If you wanna know more the purchase this at your own risk......... -Jult Warfell
4,"A great lens under good conditions, but don't expect perfection","Hello,Got this just to try out fisheye lenses.During daylight quality is awesome very sharp.Focus is slow (and loud) compare to USM.Focuses all the way down to a few inches so you can get some insane perspectives.During the night, even with AF lamp assist and flash metering thing it focuses about *half* the time ... on 5Dm3, didn't expect that at all. Granted once you lock in focus it's an amazing perspective, 2.8 really helps with low light ... but kind of bad for focusing.Even at 15 mm you get some depth of field if you focus close enough, or focus misses ...Recommended, but don't expect perfectionCheers."
5,Great deal,I use this lens to take photos while skydiving. It works great and has been very durable. I would buy it again!
3,Lens is OKAY,"I rented this lens for a wedding and enjoyed it... but not enough to purchase it. The images it produces are nice but it was incredibly loud and had a hard time focusing (which extended the noise until it focused). For the same price, I think I'd stick with the Canon 15mm."
4,Elizabeth's Choice...,"This book was good, really good but not one of the best.Firstly I am bored with Elizabeth making choices all the time.I think she must go steady with Devon, Todd is so childish and making really amusing motions, like asking Elizabeth to marry him! Jessica seems she is out of her mind.In the latest books in the series, Jessica behaves like she is out of her mind.Why Francine Pascal can't show Jessica's humanly side a little bit more? Well, you should get this book I think, it's fun to read."
3,Title sums up egotistical jerks...,"The title just conveys what jerks Todd and Devon (whom I loathe) are. I didn't realise Liz was an object or trophy for them to own or show off.Although, I have to admit that Liz is pretty much acting like a jerk herself - what's with all this insecurity and flirting? Todd's supposed to be her 'soulmate' yet, she's going around attracting the attentions of Devon Whitelaw (an arrogant fool who thinks he's too good for Jess).One thing I did love about this book was the fact that Jessica was back to her old scheming witch ways. I also loved the re-introduction of Courtney Kane (a conniving witch who could give Lila a run for her money in the snob stakes).Okay but, this whole Liz-acting-like-Jess thing is getting kind of old."
5,Great product,"Use it everyday on my kids sandwiches, great tasting and easy to make and beats the heck out of mayo."
3,Movado,Purchased both the men's and women's Luno. Had to return the mens due to a faulty clasp after bringing it to a jeweler to have the band shortened. Strange that Movado would let a watch leave the factory with such an obvious defect.
5,Love it,I gave this as a gift to my boyfriend and he loves it. It is very very sharp and there are so many people that compliment him on his watch.
5,A great history of Mexico,"This is the classic book on the history of the conquest of Mexico. Bernal Diaz fought on the front lines of Cortez's war, and he reports everything well in this book.While Diaz may have been a great soldier, he was an awful writer. He wrote this book as he was aging well after he returned home to Spain. In his original edition, there were hundreds of pages of rambling personal attacks against various people in his life. As a result, Penguin has heavily edited this edition -- it's only about half the size of the original. However, the book is greatly improved this way, and Penguin's version is very easy to read and never gets boring.Of course, Diaz doesn't have many negitive things to say about the Conquest, and he was a true believer in the religious mission of the conquistadors. Diaz essentially makes genocide seem not so bad. Read Bartolome de las Casas' books to balance out some of the propaganda contained in this book."
5,More Exciting Than Star Wars & Real Too...,"I purchased this book intending to get an unbiased view of the Spanish exploration of the New World. That is a difficult task given the nature of 20th & 21st Century academia.This text, an eye witness account of what happened on real explorations, more than satisfies my objective. What's more, it's as exciting as can be... kind of like Star Wars... exploring new worlds, defeating the bad guys and establishing new alliances.Excellent work."
4,The Conquest of New Spain,"An excellent first person account (primary doc.) although written years after the fact it gives great insight regarding personal conflicts/politics of the Spanish as well as the ""Mexicans"" and other tribes contacted.Learning about the extrodinary hardships and struggles in fighting and basic survival is astonishing."
3,Required reading for a class,Not the best out there but was required for a class that I am currently taking. Didn't really have a choice on the selection due to class reading requirements.
5,Different Era-Same Energy!,"In 1989 the Bee Gees went on a world tour that was exhaustive. Pulling no punches with a high-tech designed set, the stage was well produced. All the hits are here (27 songs total) and the sound is crisp and clear. Note that this is not DTS available as ""One Night Only"" is, but the presentation seems more intimate than Las Vegas's huge concert. Filmed in Melbourne, Australia, the Gibbs seem more relaxed and it shows.Typical of most concert DVD's, there is a Discography and a Timeline noting all the hgihlights of the Bee Gees career. The biggest highlight is the concert itself with a knockout light show that rivals ""One Night Only"". See for yourself."
1,The not so good live concert !,"The title of this DVD is half true, yes, most of the songs are very well qualified as the very best of Bee Gees, unfortunately, the truth ends here, the audio of the dis makes any karaoke sounds real music to the ears, the lighting, camera angles are bearable at best. As their fans for years, it doesn't stop me buying the real deal ""One night only"" next."
3,Go For It!,"The Dolby stereo on this disc is far below the quality of their ""One Night Only"" DVD - far below the quality of most of my old VHS concerts for that matter. Sad that the Brothers Gibb let this one slip through. Even with substandard audio, it's a great concert. The Bee Gees are in top form here and anyone who likes the Bee Gees will truly enjoy the performance."
3,Doesn't work for Mac,I bought these to upgrade my mac desktop but they weren't the right ones. I gave them to a friend and they work great for her.
5,A Cardinals Video Treasury,"If you're a true St. Louis Cardinals fan, you'll have a hard time spending 90 minutes better than in watching this video. Narrated by Hall of Famer Jack Buck, the video chronicles the first 100 years of Cardinal baseball, Hornsby to Ozzie, with 15 pennants and 9 world championships in between. The most unforgettable moments are all here: Grover Alexander in the '26 Series, Dizzy and the Gashouse Gang, Slaughter's mad dash, Gibson's magical 1968, Brock's base-stealing records. Oh, and more than a little Stan the Man! For younger fans, check out Ray Lankford knocking Phillie catcher Darren Daulton out cold as he scores a game-winning run his rookie season. A great, great trip down memory lane for Cardinal loyalists."
3,good but not as advertised,This alternator arrived in fine shape but did not include the rotor and cap contrary to the description. I requested the missing parts and was promptly sent a new unit without a rotor or cap. I would have given it five stars if it had been as described. I would have given it five stars if the description didn't include the cap and rotor. The unexpected extra expense of parts that were supposed to be included and the trip to UPS to return an identical incomplete part account for the low rating on an otherwise usable part.
3,"Useful book, but too much generalization.","This book is fairly useful if you are wanting to begin learning about women and Ireland for the first time. . It has some useful questions at the end of each essay which can be good jumping off points for other research. However, it is too focussed on the feminist paradigm of male patriarchal dominance and female resistence to that patriarchy. That is not to say patriarchy is omnipresent in modern Ireland, but rather that the way in which it plays out is much more complex. some of the authors are quite arrogant in their discussions of Irish women, particularly those who practice Catholicism, thus the essays, while useful, must be taken with a grain of salt. If this topic interests you, ""Gender and Sexuality in Modern Ireland"" by Anthony Bradley and Maryann Gialanella Valiulis contains much more complex and nuanced essays for further reading."
1,"Addico Milano Hot & Cold Water Cooler, White",The unit does not come with a bottle cover as advertized
2,Help! Damsel In Addico Milano Distress! Need Waterbottle Cap!,"I have the Addico Milano cool/coldwater water cooler model 405C. For the life of me I cannot find something as simple as the Addivalve No-Splash cap that fits on the bottles. Do they screw on or snap on? I could not contact the company in Canada as the company link was obsolete (as were other dead end sites). I tried endless searches to no avail. Does anyone have a cap they can part with? Also, I'm getting mixed signals about this cooler. There doesn't seem to be much middle ground where consumers are concerned. Seems they either love the thing or hate it. It looks like it is cheaply made and has shoddy parts. There was no cover that came with this cooler either. If anyone has or knows where I can get a cap cheap or gratis, I'd appreciate it. Please put Addico Milano Cap in the subject field. Thank you!softtide@hotmail.com"
5,Perfect,This is the best water dispenser I've been able to find. I especially like the black color option as it fits into my home decor more subtley. GET IT!
1,Same old same old trendy lefty PC rubbish,"If you listen to NPR you'll love this collection of soothing nothings from your old pals. If you loathe NPR you'll wonder where the controversy, contrast and color is. Editors could not seem to find anything at all worthwhile from Reason, National Review, Weekly Standard, American Spectator, etc. which do publish excellent essays. So we are forced to read essays by little would-be commissars who would like the power to dictate what is in all our lives a necessity and what a luxury. Andrew Sullivan's piece is the only thought-provoking one in the book and look at all the amazement it has elicited from the other reviewers.Save your dough. Save your time. This whole waste is the ultimate example of preaching to the choir."
3,How People Really Think,"This classic in cognitive science has a great deal to say, but an awkward way of saying it. Author Jerry A. Fodor's style is academic and dense, a potential barrier to all but the most determined, well-prepared reader. Arcane and brilliant, Fodor intersperses colloquial jests with jargon-burdened exposition, leading one to believe that he could have written a book more accessible to the lay reader had he wished to do so. We find, however, that the book repays the persistent, dedicated reader. The reward is a fascinating exploration of the mind, drawing on the literature of epistemology and psychology, with occasional detours down the rarely explored byways of phrenology."
1,Doesn't line up,"This kit is very cute, however, unfortunately the colors on the mat and the printed diagram do not match up, making it very confusing, frustrating, and impossible to complete accurately. Not at all fun, and a waste of time and money."
5,Must have for your Library!,"The only movie Elvis ever died in..the only one I ever cried in! Good movie though! If you have a DVD library, you need this one too."
3,"With only one song , this movie is a disappointment?","This movie is an early one where Elvis actually does some real acting and it is a Cowboy and Indian and half-breed movie.Texas has an Indian uprising in 1878 of his mother's people:his white older half brother and his father make his family half native American and they are caught between.Tragedy results with loss of friends and family.As I love Elvis's singing I miss there not being moremusic, but the script is a grim tale of a lot of death and sorrow."
4,Elvis at his best!,"Best Elvis movie ever! Good storyline - fine director and great co-stars, many of them western veterans. Pity, that his fans wouldn't let him do more real movies like this one instead of lousy sing-and-dance films which followed. It's known that Malon Brando was considered for the part which Elvis played but did you know that Frank Sinatra was concidered for the part of the big brother which Steve Forrest played?"
5,IT WAS THE BEST FILM ELVIS MADE,"ELVIS WAS VERY CONVINCING AS AN INDIAN HALF BREED. IT WAS VERY HEART FELT THE WAY HE PLAYED PACER. I TRULY LOVED IT THE OTHER MOVIES WERE TO MUCH OF A ""PRETTY FACE"" KIND OF FILM. THIS ONE IS HIS BEST WORK OTHER THAN THE LIVE PREFORMANCES HE DID. THANK YOU."
4,A Classic,"What a first class film. After the worrying opening sequence with Elvis singing "" A Cane & A High Starched Collar"" with one chaps dancing partner being a chair, we open up to a classic Western. With excellent picture quality, Elvis' performance is totally believable as a man torn between two sides. Only criticism is the huge amount of wasted space on the DVD which could have a least have had a documentary perhaps showing deleted scences, I would have loved to see Elvis singing ""Summer Kisses, Winter Tears"" or ""Britches"". Ho-Hum! Perhaps there will be a special collectors edition one day."
2,Like the movie not the product...,"I have always loved the movie but the quality of the dvd was very poor. The images were dark and a little blurred, and the sound was not very good. Was not happy."
4,Flaming Star,It was Good But I Like his movies that he sings in better. Elvis Presley Was NOT a Good droma movie Star. However I like all kinds of westerns. ARK
4,Motorola Q Extended battery,The battery Was ship within a day or 2 and i received it in new conditon and is working perfectly. WIll do business again. The Battery Make's the Phone Last 2 days even with continued use.
3,Doesn't seem that extended to me,"Ordered the battery from Wirefly and it doesn't seem to be any different then the original battery I had. I am lucky to get through the day without it dying. I do quite a bit of text, email and phone calls, but I thought I would get more out of the battery. I have called Wirefly becuase I have to think the battery may be defective. I have to send it back to them, order a new one from them and also wait up to 30 days to see the credit go back on my card. More then likely will order a new one, but not from Wirefly and see if I just got a bad battery."
2,Forget Wirefly,"Motorola Extra Capacity Battery and Battery door for the MOTO Q PhoneThe extended life battery worked well for 2 months, was great. Then it died, wouldn't charge (original battery works fine - I also tried different charger). Wirefly customer service, on phone and email, was unresponsive (although one via email acknowledged battery was ""defective""). They said they would only exchange or refund accessories within a month. Told me over and over to buy a new battery from them."
3,Wish Motorola had got it right initially,This is so much better than the battery that came with the phone; however I still have problems with my phone holding a charge for any period of time beyond a day. I think it has to do more with my phone and less with this battery.That being said I have been using this battery for over a year and it still holds a charge as well as it did initially and MUCH better than the smaller battery that came with the phone.If you are having problems with your phone holding a charge this is at least a partial answer if returning the phone and getting something other than Motorola is not an option.
3,It's alright,"When I first got it, I was impressed by the battery life, however, over the last two months of using it, it seems like the battery life is slowly shortening... We'll see in a few more months."
3,Bulky and loses capacity over time,Adds over double the bulk to the phone and does not add but about 30% to the battery life. I still eeded two batteries for my daily life unless I want to charge it at lunch time which is not always possible.
4,"larger capacity, but still does not hold for the day","If you are a heavy user, this battery will surely help you, but still will not last an entire day..."
5,Just what I ordered!!!,"The Sling was just what I wanted, and just what I ordered. It looks so great on my M1 Garand."
1,takes to long,i'm not sure on the content of this iteam as i have yet to recieve it 2.5 months later
5,Great movie - I enjoyed every minute of it,I was a little surprised by the tatoo at first. I really didn't know what to expect for the film. What I saw was an entire theater captured by the story. Anita and Margo will steal your hearts. I highly recommend the film.
5,Thank you,"I am tired of writing what other knows already, so I am just going to cut and paste this version of exciting comment and review to everyone to read and gets the same boring imagination. Yea! Goog! wove it"
2,"I wanted to know something new, but got rewritten articles from media","Nothing new. For a person, who constantly reads this kind of books, Revolutionary Wealth is just boring. Don't waste your time and money."
4,An important book in my opinion.,Traditional economics books leave out a great deal that one must go to another source such as this book to read about. This oversight is pasrt of the problem that we are now facing as we discover that conventional economics has led the world economies into what we are now calling the Great Recession. This book will be part of the basis for new economic though developing as a result of our current economic problems.
1,"Many Pages, Little Substance","The authors wrote many pages, but they did not really say much of substance. They seemed to repeat themselves quite a bit too. I would skip this one."
1,What about the climate and environnement?,"Is it possible to consider the future of the planet without envisaging the challenges of global sustainability? Are Alvin and Heidi Toeffler suddenly blind or deaf? Do they really believe that it is possible to forget these environmental issues in an analysis of the global trends? Do they really mean that this issue will be solved ""naturally"" by the implementation of new technologies? What a poor and debatable vision..."
4,Future Optimism,"The authors of Revolutionary Wealth have written several answers to the question of, ""What will the future look like?"" The book goes over past and current trends to extrapolate the future. The title is somewhat misleading, because this is not a book on economics, or on how to make money. In fact, it's just a free-wheeling conversation about what the future may bring. Some interesting facts are that education is a 400 billion dollar a year system and that Helium-3 could be the future of fuel/energy. If you are looking for a literary jaunt through technology, politics, economics, and history, you may enjoy this quick read. If, however, you are looking for something serious or profound, you should avoid this book."
4,nice alternative to a larger bone,"I give one of these to my golden retriever once or twice a week. It's just the right size for her to enjoy it for an hour or so, but not so big that she overeats (she'll work at any rawhide until it's gone). She prefers the Dingo brand, and I like the higher quality."
3,Wish they were made here,"My dogs love these so much. It's the one thing I have to bite my tongue on and buy for them despite my misgivings. So far they have never gotten sick on them and that's a plus but I wish, wish, wish that these were made in America."
3,roka un poco,"When I decided to buy a Soda Stereo album, I was influenced by other latin american singer or bands, like Shakira, Mana and others, so I was expecting something in that style. The first listening was not a great impact, expecially starting with the first punk-stilish songs from the older album, then going into the more sophisicated pieces from the latest period. But their unique style was convincing me more and more every time I listened to it, and in a few months I can say I am satisfied of the album even if I cannot claim myself a fan. I still find hard to compare them to anyone else. There is instead another band from Argentina that makes me really crazy and they are called 'La Mosca' (The fly). I have not seen them listed in this library but the day they will, it is going to be a real top hit..."
2,Disappointing Thought from a Strong Thinker,"I found these essays disappointing as one quite familiar with the strength and breath of Dobyns work. I felt the questions he asks are too easy, too obvious for such a formidable thinker, I found this quite surprising, and so though I enjoyed the essays, I didn't really learn anything new."
3,The best intentions,"Not sure it will make you a poet. But good intentions don't always lead to the subway. Heck, if he had read his own book, would he have written ""Paradise Lost""? As Pierre Menard said (in Spanish), I am competing with Cervantes. The influence of Harold Bloom is nowhere less felt. Put your anxiety aside and spill your drink into the face of the loudmouth begging for it. Is that a prescription for poetry. Maybe not, but until a better one comes along, I'll stick with the best (thank you, Samuel Taylor Coleridge)."
4,A must read for any Dallas Fan. Relives the return to glory!,A great behind the scenes look at the first Super Bowl title won by the Jerry Jones/Jimmy Johnson regime. Really makes you appreciate how rare winning a Super Bowl is and fortunate they are to have won three. Bayless had unlimited access and it shows.
1,"Skip Bayless is ""RAINMAN""","Skip is not a real sportswriter, and never will be. He is an ESPN pawn, drumming up controversy after controversy for ratings. It makes sense he's a Cowboys fan - because he is a waste of human flesh like all other Dallas fans. Enjoy reading about the past. Your dynasty is over."
3,It works for its intended use.,"After using this product for about a month, I've noticed some strengths and weaknesses.Strengths:60 Lbs of media last a good while at lower pressure.Works good for liquid media (Water and soap, mixes for degreasing etc)Can't beat the price.Fantastic for none cabinet small part use.Great for patio decking and natural surfaces.Weaknesses:Not so great for large surface area scale and rust (Automotive door skins, trunks, hoods etc.)60 Lbs of media doesn't last long at higher pressure.It's gravity/siphon fed.Large media will not pass into siphon hose (m>40 grit.)Overall it's a great buy for small parts and items which require blasting. It doesn't require huge CFM from your compressor to operate; my 30 gallon gave 70 PSI all day long.This is an excellent tool to keep in your garage."
2,Not worth the Money,"It's a decent book to get you started using frames,but there is no way it is worth 40 bucks. There are a lot of better books out there for less."
1,"Regular Tips, not recomendable","I read this paper, and a just wanna say : All the tips I runned, was a disaster in my job. Be long away from this book!"
5,Worked like a charm,The blades fit perfectly in my shaver and came with blade covers. The shaver works like new now.
5,Cost Saver,"Bought these to replace the heads in my Norelco. Shaver was fine and still recharging, but not shaving as close as it used to. Put these in and had to ease up on shaving pressure or shave too close. Good option if your shaver is still working fine."
1,New but an already opened product,"I can't never believe that I bought a product at Amazon.com that was listed ""NEW"" but it actually was opened product before.The seller should explained it on the descriptions."
3,Lovely Green Eyes,"I've always been interested in reading books on the different periods of war. This is the first book I've read that centers around the concentration camps, and this book specifically, on the German field brothels of WWII. It's a rambling, disjointed story that reads how a person that is reminiscing would tell a story. It's hard sometimes to follow who the author is describing or commenting about as the author jumps from character to scene and back. It's dark, and revels what I would imagine is only a glimpse of what really happened during this time. I would give it between three stars and four, only because of the difficulty sometimes of following the story. I read this on a Kindle."
5,Carryin' On,"This is a great CD. All the songs are strong, but especially 'ease back'. I just wish blue note would keep CDs from this era in its catalogue instead of doing a limited run and then letting them lapse again. Perhaps better yet, let people download good quality copies from the toshiba-emi website if producing the CDs themselves is too costly."
1,disjointed,A disjoint account of a small part of the life of a talented man who has lived a very full life.
3,Good Look at Christians in the Marketplace,"""Lion vs. Christian"" is written by someone with a favorable point of view towards business and capitalism. The title contains encouragements and food for thought for the Christian who is engaged in the marketplace.While the title is good for a quick pick-me-up, there are many other titles of more substantative content written by other Christian authors. Specifically, titles by Larry Burkett, Doug Sherman, and John Maxwell are available for those who wish to explore in more depth the details of getting along with others and dealing with the tough marketplace situations that Christians will encounter.The title is only about 110 pages and has a 1979 date. Therefore, readers may want to consider the newer and more comprehensive titles by the authors mentioned above in dealing with the realities of the business world.Lion vs. Christian is still recommended as a quick and easy read."
3,The proof is in the pudding,"Are we going to listen to some little guy in a white suit with a PHD on what is good or us or are we going to California and seek out someone with natural beauty (Toni DeMarco in 1976) to find out her secret?While believing in the proper diet and exercise, she stresses that you are the only one that can say what you should eat.The book does go over several stratagems of consumption, and psychology of cooking.There are no revelations here. She goes over vitamins, minerals, and food types.Bottom line is a few recipes and several pictures of just her on the beach and her in fruit."
5,King Ronnie,"...Ronnie Coleman being Ronnie Coleman. One of the few Kings of our sport. If you rate this video negatively, you obviously shouldn't be watching it to begin with. As a matter of fact, why don't you put down your Diet Coke and bag of Doritos and head to the gym."
4,A very good debut from her actic career to singing,"This album of ballad music is very good and just about all of her songs are very romantic about the relationships of young people. She also appears in popular latin soap operas such as ""Confidente de Secundaria"" and stars in ""Preciosa""."
2,This Book is for Highly skilled Brew Masters at a Brewery,"This book deals with the highly skilled, advanced, scientific mind of a Brew Master or scientist who needs an answer in skilled scientific jargon, this is not a Homebrewing book by any means. I have been brewing for 16+ years, and have 80+ books on the subject of the Brewing Art and this book I doubt, I'll ever open!"
3,Fund Raiser,There was some very good music on this CD but it came across more like a local fundraiser than the star powered music fest i expected. Okay but not great.
1,Garbage,"This is the worst piece of electronics I have ever purchased. The CD player failed within 2 weeks, and the sound quality is horrible. The person who designed this garbage should be forced to live in a small, dark room with nothing but this piece of junk for entertainment. I will never buy another electronic item from Emerson again!"
1,Should have read reviews first...,I bought this from a store display and didn't read any reviews beforehand or I wouldn't have bought it. I bought this for my baby's room for the clock and to play his bedtime music in the CD player. CD player stopped working after 4 months. Scrap metal now. Don't waste your money. Spend a few more dollars for a different manufacturer. I'm going to.
1,Disappointed,"Pros: Worked great when I first bought it.Cons: Cell phones within 25ft send it into a buzzing fit, whether the radio is on or off.CD player stopped working.Buttons stopped working. Had to unplug it to turn it off or had to wait for whenever it was ready to turn back on.Advice: There are a lot of radio/CD alarm clocks in the sea, don't bother catching this one."
1,One of the worst designs ever,"I bought this to replace a 15-year old CD clock radio that (for $150!) did two things - it let me fall asleep to music and wake up to an alarm. 15 years later, Emerson releases a product that cannot even do this. You can choose to EITHER fall asleep to music OR wake up to an alarm, but you cannot do both! After hooking it up and reading the manual, I took it right back to the store. Who designs this stuff?"
2,Display Too Bright and 2nd Alarm not useful,"My first complaints was that the display is way too bright. Not bright enough to read a book by, but it's darn close. I'm finding that to be the case with most clocks with green displays.The second issue is that, while this has a second alarm time feature, you do not have the option of having one wake up time for CD and one wakeup time for the buzzer. It's either both buzzer or both CD. I like to wake up to a relaxing CD, then have the buzzer kick in if I still oversleep.The fact that it only plays the first track is bearable for me, as I just burn a Wake Up Mix onto a CD (and this reads CD-Rs). Other than those two complaints, the unit worked fine for the week I kept it. I just could get to sleep with a night-light 6 inches from my nose and blocking the display sort of defeats the purpose of having a CD Alarm CLOCK."
1,Not again,"This makes an annoying buzzing sound when the CD stops playing. The buzz is louder when you turn the power off. Within a year, the CD won't play unless I open it, give the disc a spin, close it, and press play. This has been in my daughter's room since she was a baby. She learned at 20 months how to get it to play. Wish I'd payed more money for a better one. I'm looking for one for the new baby's room and it won't be this one again."
1,Built-in self obsolessence (apologies if that's misspelled.),"Well, pretty much what everyone else said about this unit has happened to me: the CD player stopped working after about six months, it buzzes whenever someone with a cell phone is nearby (even when my cordless phone is next to it!) and now *none* of the buttons works at all, rendering it a useless hunk of metal and plastic. For a while, I actually resorted to plugging it in at midnight so at least I'd have a clock even if it flashed all the time. Horrendous disappointment. (Looking for a replacement just now by reading amazon reviews, it's amazing how few quality CD clock radios there are on the market. It's shocking.)"
3,A Compromise,"Pros: the price and the cd playerCons: way too many tiny buttons with small print to function well as an alarm clock; small radio dial makes it difficult to hone in on stations close together; to turn off alarm, you move the switch away from you, which takes some getting used to. Also, I use to have a dual alarm and miss the ability to set alternative wake up times."
1,Huge Piece of GARBAGE,"Heed the other reviewers opinions who rated this unit low. One star is too much, if I could rate this a ZERO I would.This unit was obviously designed and assembled by MORONS! Here is a list of features: lousy control layout, flakey operation, useless battery backup function, and poor stereo sound - I can get better sound quality from the drive-thru speaker at Mickey Dee's!!!Finally, to top it off the CD laser quit working after the PALTRY 90 day warrantee expired, so guess what - I'M OUT OF LUCK!!! I guess they make these things to self destruct after 3 months and expect that we are stupid enough to buy another one from them. Save your money and don't get ripped off by this company who cranks out sub-standard junk. This will be going in the trash tomorrow!I will make a note to NEVER BUY A PRODUCT FROM EMERSON AGAIN."
2,Who designed this thing?,"Although the features list is great, the layout is pitiful. I wish there had been pictures showing the controls in close-ups. There were no reviews when I bought to point out the poor design.The buttons are small, the labels are tiny, the button layout and usage is counter-intuitive for even basic functions. (How hard can a clock radio with CD player be? It isn't rocket science!)The on/off and setting and stopping time and alarm take some real getting used to. There are only forward and backward buttons for time; I'd prefer they had assigned the buttons to hours and minutes instead.Spend your money on a different CD clock radio, and don't bother with this one."
1,Passed by in Time.,"Had played this game way back when it first came out, and enjoyed it very much. I knew it would be simple compared to some of today's more complicated and advanced games, but that was fine with me. Turns out the problem is that the game is so old that it won't load up all the way, or does load, and then will never execute the start up. Tried it on both my computers, the oldest being from 2007, and on two others owned by friends (both only a year or two old), and the game just wouldn't ever work. Very sad, as I really looked forward to playing it."
3,Too low key,"After getting the Branch Warren, then one of the Ronnie Coleman DVD this DVD was kind of a snooze. What little Dexter does say is a lot of ""I'm getting old"" my knees hurt, my wrist hurts, I have to eat different because I'm old. Then a lot of video of him eating, but little dialog just him cooking fish and grits and watching TV or at restaurant eating. But does get his sponsors plugs in. He should get ""I Can't Believe It's Not Butter"" as a sponsor because he drowns all his food in that stuff. So I found Branch and Ronnie's DVDs more entertaining and informative at the same time."
4,"Nice, theft proof antenna","After my wife had 2 antennas stolen off the glass, I decided to try this internal antenna. It seems to work as well as the external through the glass antenna did. Neither work as well as a drilled through the roof antenna but no one wants to drill a hole in a new car. One thing to be aware of is this antenna comes with a funky female connector. I had to cut it off and install a crimp on TMC connector for my phone. Most car kits and adapter cables require either a TMC or mini-UHF connector. Not sure why this included a non-standard female connector but just be aware of this if you purchase."
1,Worth Nothing....Disrespectful of the tradition,This book is worthless. The descriptions of the Odu/Divination patterns it gives have nothing to do with either Cuban or Nigerian traditional interpretations. The book is disrespectful of the tradition from which it misappropriates.
5,Very helpful product.,"[[ASIN:B00020HXBW KAL - Beyond St.John's Wort, 60 tablets]. Product was helpful and item was shipped on time.It was cheaper than buying it locally."
2,good idea but quality is ok,"compared to Haba products, this was disappointing, one the seam broke the first week and I have a 6 month old girl w/ teeth. I wish the quality was better. Cute overall."
1,Do not buy this toy,This product was rated as containing high levels of arsenic and lead and other chemicals. As per some of the reviews I hate to think that babies are ingesting this garbage. Here is the link:[...]
1,Fans BEWARE!!!,"TTF fans - beware! DJ Dean has changed his style dramatically. This is no longer the hard German trance that we all used to love. This is some boring generic Trance that is NOT hard and NOT exciting at all.Just look at the tracklists of the recent two TTFs, 28 and this one, 29. They're very unusual for Dean. I have no idea why he's changing his style -- this is really an insult to his fans -- it's very doubtful that I will buy future releases from him! Even the DJ Networx series has become utter unlistenable GENERIC and BORING cr@p.Tragic, simply tragic."
3,right on target-polygamy,"Book nbr 2 (there are 7 out now)Lena Jones (PI) is a hard hard person. She has scars on her face and scars in her heart. She was shot, abandoned and abused in foster homes growing up. She takes on the hard cases. She works more cases for free than she gets paid for. In this book she is hired to stop the marriage of 13yr old Rebecca to the old prophet Solomon in Purity. Solomon is murdered and Rebecca's mother is arrested for murder. Lena goes under cover in Purity (this could never happen) to solve this case. What she finds is shocking. Lena does solve the murder but nothing much changes in Purity. Iam not really a Lena Jones fan but I have been reading true life polygamy books and I wanted to see if Betty Webb (author) gets the story right. She did. ITS RIGHT ON TARGET....SHE GOT NOTHING WRONG."
4,Interesting Subject,"This is the second book I have read in the Lena Jones series. The synopsis has already been given comprehensively - so I won't repeat it.I thought this mystery was well written. I didn't automatically know who the murderer would be - and the identity did take me by surprise. The writing was taut and the subject matter extremely interesting. I certainly didn't know a lot about polygamy prior to this book. It made for gripping reading. How the women were isolated and oppressed. Their suffering was physical, emotional and mental which made for thought provoking reading.The mystery component of the book was pretty good as well - I like PI Lena Jones she is a strong and get vulnerable character. I also like the cast of characters who are Lena's support. What has been a consistent theme through the series to date has been the description of the Arizona countryside, very authentic. I am enjoying the series to date."
3,Disappointing,I've never been fond of being preached at and that is what I felt reading this book. I've really enjoyed all of Betty Webb's books until this one so I'm hoping that this was just bump in the road.
4,INVESTIGATIVE SKILLS PUT TO WORK!,"Betty Webb's investigative skills as a journalist shine here in this compelling tale of the oppresive life of women and children in the abhorrent polygamous Mormon sects of the American Southwest. One of my favorite TV series was ""Big Love,"" but Webb's novel deepened my understanding of the criminality involved in polygamy. I read this detective story on the recommendation of a friend who'd recently heard Webb speak. And I'll certainly read her others! As a journalist and author myself, I appreciate her writing style, too. [ASIN:B009PMJCOO RIVER THROUGH MY SOUL Living Simply on a Houseboat, Looking for Lost Love (WHERE LOVE LEADS Trilogy)]]"
4,Great Episodes Cut Short,"Hey, I don't know about you guys, but I really dislike the way Paramount edits some of the best episodes of The Odd Couple's 5th season. How could they do such a thing? A lot of people grew up watching The Odd Couple in their original versions. For example, in the episode ""Strike Up the Band Or Else,"" Oscar persuades Felix to play at a charity dance, but before Oscar gets to the apartment, Felix's band, ""The Sophisticatos,"" sing their theme song. Sadly, this is one of the parts they cut out. I really wanted to show my daughter that part! I think that Paramount should create a DVD set that includes ALL of the deleted scenes. Besides, a DVD can hold tons of footage compared to a VHS, so that shouldn't be a problem. Another thing that bothered me was that I saw one TV station showing the same episode with all of the deleted scenes in it. If they made their DVD sets like that, they would get a lot of buyers."
1,I certainly will NOT be ordering this !!!,"I grew up watching the Odd Couple tv shows. After reading the reviews and learning of all the awful botched episodes, I will NOT be buying the other episodes. I already own 1, 2 & 3. What a sad situation for all of us who think this was one of the greatest sitcoms of all time !!! Maybe with enough complaints, the Paramont Uppitys will put things back where they were originally?"
3,Great for fans of the show.,Not as good as the earlier episodes but very funny. You will love it if you are a real fan.
4,Great Even With the Cuts...,"Yes, it's a bit annoying when a couple of episodes just end sloppily, with no proper ending, but, come on now- the show is great even with those sloppy edits. Recommended, edits and all- and keep in mind- the DVDs do not say ""The Complete."" :)"
1,5 Stars for the Show BUT 1 Star for the Lousy DVDS!!,"Paramount has completely destroyed this series. I was looking forward to sharing this series with my daughters but wind up trying to explain what was missing and why it might have been funny. This is nothing short of criminal and whoever did this at Paramount deserves to be fired. I have never NEVER seen anything like the utter disregard for anything in the arts. It's not just the music. There are definitely other cuts throughout the series. Like I'm pretty sure they cut the line from ""I Gotta Be Me"" in Season 3 where Oscar (in role reversal as felix) during the wine tasting tells the dinner guests to 'roll it around in your mouth until it tastes like shoe polish. 'What's next, Paramount? Going to strip the Nino Rota score from the Godfather?? You owe fans an apology and you also owe them new uncut DVDs that we paid good money for."
3,Missing music,"I bought this set because I already have seasons 1 - 4 and wanted to complete my collection. Like everyone else I'm ticked about the missing music segments. OK, Paramount didn't want to pay for these songs, but did they even have to? I would think that most (if not all) this stuff would be in Public Domain by now - the songs were old when 'Odd Couple' used them in the 70s. So what's the deal...?"
1,I'll stick with my local channel,"This DVD is a rip-off. Seasons 3, 4, and 5 of the Odd Couple were butchered by Paramount like there's no tomorrow. The musical cuts are ridiculous. At times there is so much cut that the episodes lose some of their best comedic elements. Seriously Paramount, is this the best you can do?The Odd Couple no longer airs on TV nationwide but it does air locally in my area. I'll watch it in syndication and boycott the DVDs. I'm tired of the studios blowing TV releases, especially the classics. It was perfect in the '70s, and now it's messed up. Totally unacceptable."
1,2 MUCH MISSING FROM ORIGINAL SERIES 2MUCH EDITTING,"THE SHOW IS FANTASTIC - no sitcoms like that any more, but the editing is awful.I watched this show religiously when in high school and I remember so much of the dialogue and was sad to see some very key dialogue removed. WHY?oscar and felix had great lines and even better delivery. some lines they kept in weren't nearly as funny as what they took out. SHAME on THEM. I await a ""real"" uncut original series."
3,How can I put this...,"I'm torn as to how to review this, but I have to be honest. The producers of this set chopped up the episodes terribly...it wasn't even good editing. It was obvious that something was missing off many of the episodes. There was at least one that kind of just stopped and that was it (the end of the episode)! I remember watching The Odd Couple as a child but didn't remember any of the episodes, specifically. In my quest to build a nice family collection of DVDs, I purchased this set, even knowing that they were chopped up (that's the only way I can think to describe them), from reading other reviews. I wanted to see them so desperately. But I would not recommend their purchase to others. I feel my money was wasted. It's not Oscar & Felix's fault, but the fault of whoever decided to ruin a great classic show by cutting and editing this season...to death."
2,Last Segment Missing,"Very dissapointed to find out my favorite episode ""Stike up the Band or Else"" has the last segment of the show missing. This last part ties in with the whole story and is part of the fun. I purchased this season specifically for this episode. Very, very, dissapointed in CBS TV on DVD for this lack of content."
3,Music edits again bring the rating down,"Sadly, the worst edit of all was removing Oscar's ""Singing In the Rain"" bit at the end of the scene in ""Felix Remarries"" Five to ten seconds of this song was too expensive to leave in the show? It completely changes changes."
1,Too many edits,First off let me say I love the Odd Couple series but not this DVD. As a kid me & my brother use to watch it faithfully growing up. I still remember the scenes that are about to coming up...that is until they edited the crap out this last season.After watching the first disc which I counted a total of 3 edits. It took me 3 months before I even played the 2nd disc. Which was worse than the first disc. I was surprised they didn't edit out the Paul Williams episode which has a number of songs. I think if they did it would of been a 5 minute episode. It's a real shame because they are one of the greatest comedy teams. Too many edits I am totally (edit)...
1,Refuse to buy edited version,"Thank you to the other reviewers for your comments. This is one of my favorite sitcoms of all time, which is why I refuse to settle for anything less than the uncut, unedited version. Once the studio decides to release it that way, I'll buy. Until then, I'll put my money elsewhere."
1,Not even close.,"Unhappily, this book is a mishmash of characters who are difficult to distinguish at times, and the confusion is madeconsiderably greater by the frequent shifting of decades inwhich the story developes.For me, it was punishment to even finish the book, and I simplycannot recommend it."
1,John Lennon would spit on this,"Stupidly, I judged a book by its cover. During a recent jaunt to [a local bookstore], I saw this book and the words ""John Lennon"" shining like a beacon in the sea of paperbacks. ""Why, this must be good. No one would dare write a bad book with the words 'John Lennon' in the title,"" I thought to myself.I was wrong. After several failed attempts to finish this monstrosity, I finally tossed it into the fireplace, where I will relish the opportunity to burn it when winter commences.The writing is stilted, the descriptions cliche at best, and the author needs a thorough lesson in writing a complete sentence. That being said, I read almost halfway through the book without noting even an iota of plot or action. I winced during every mention of John Lennon and the tacky attempts to mimic his accent and humor. Yuck."
2,or is it just propoganda...,"The text is interesting at best. The other edition ""New Expansive Poetry"" edited by R. S. Gwynn is a little less one-sided. There are many other collections of essays that provide better introductions to New Formalist, New Narrative, and Expansive Poetry, namely Annie Finch's ""After New Formalism,"" which is a much more open-minded texts that admits it own faults and is aware of the social-political aspects of form."
2,Potential but leaves you hanging,"This movie lacks in story. There is no explanation as to what happens to ""The Children"". The plot is way too simple. The murder scenes lack the gore and shock factor, taking the enjoyment out of this horror. Is it a slasher film? No. Is it a psychological horror? No. What the heck is it? Don't waste your time or money on this one. Oh, and the reason I gave it two stars as opposed to one is that there is one scene in the tent that involves a doll - I don't want to give it away but that scene alone earned this stupid movie an extra star."
2,It sucked,"The movie first off had a few actors that I respected in the movie so with that, I thought is would be worth the watch. But, right off it was very confusing. The movie was slow to take off like waiting in traffic on the runway at the airport. Then when it did, you were like huh? What caused this? The scenes which could of been better were quick cuts which you really didn't see much. Don't watse your money it will be on TV soon."
4,Horror that's Truly Horrifying!,"This is a great film in any genre, the children really delivers the horror unlike 95% of other movies that claim to be horror and just plain suck. I'm an avid horror fan so trust me when I say you can't miss with this one. From the very beginning the tension and unease continue to build until it's so thick you can push it aside like a curtain. You actually wish something would happen just to let the air back into the room, even though you know it will be terrible. Prepare for some truly disturbing material with visuals to match!"
1,Slow,"I doubt I will watch another movie from Ghost House. This was slow, acting was bad, and you had to guess sometimes as to what was happening. What a disapointment."
2,Borrrring!,"This movie could of had potential but, instead it flops! I actually liked the cheap original version from the 80's better! By the time this movie begins to pick up and the parents are being killed off, your already a 1/3 through the movie and the killing that's done is done off the camera! They leave it to your imagination! Borrrring! Check out the original movie before you watch this crappy re-make!"
4,Creepy,"A nice refreshing change of pace from all the torture terrors. Just nice, fun, homicidal children. Actually, this is a great little chiller because it had a few ingredients other horror films seem to lack these days: real suspense, eerie soundtrack, and a really good sense of tension. Quite enjoyable for the thriller-lover. recommended. (and a good excuse to skip the next famly function or join planned parenthood)."
3,Some good performances from the kids,"The kids they chose for this film were great and held their own among the adult cast members. There is some rather bloody stuff here, with the kids becoming killers and not realizing it or being able to help it.I just wish we had known a bit more about how they got infected and how others were getting it too. This is never explained. Is it happening everywhere?"
5,A fine person,"I used to think I was in love with Garry Marshall because of his films and sitcoms, but now it's because he's truly a fine person. Read the book and I think you'll agree. If you're a screenwriter thinking about writing for sitcoms, this should be required reading. I'm more of a spec writer, so I just enjoyed the stories and laughs. This is a story of one of the most successful people in Hollywood and more importantly, a good father, brother, son, and grandfather."
3,not what I expected!,I read vampire romances...exclusively. I was very disappointed when I read this. It is not a vamire romance. It is just a romance...no vampires in it! So vampire fans: this is not what you are looking for!
2,Lack luster as a shap sorter,"Ok. At first I thought this toy was great. But really... it isn't.As far as a shape sorter goes... this is a pretty poor example. The birds are over stuffed and do not fit into their respective holes. In addition, if one DOES manage to a get a bird in to the house through it's hole, there isn't really enough room for all of the birds unless the house is busting at it's seems.The birds are cute, the house is cute, but it just doesn't live up to it's claim of being a shape sorter. My ten month old never plays with this toy and shows zero interest in it. Not even just to play with the birds."
4,very cute toy,"I bought this toy because it is soft, cute, and teaches shapes. My daughter is now 20 months and still plays with it. It still looks great. She likes to haul it around like it's a purse."
5,My 1-year-old daughter loves it and so do I!,"I started reading Jillian Harker's ""Oakey:A goodnight kiss"" to my daughter when she was about 10 months old, and she and I both fell in love with the little bunny. When I noticed the other books by Jillian on the back cover, I went and ordered this book that same day. The adorable little bunny Oakey is so endearing, these books are a sure favorite for any child. Andy Everitt-Stewart's bright and colorful illustrations make the books an absolute joy to look at, too. A definite thumbs up all around!"
1,Avoid like the plague,"I'm the computer technician for our company. I just pulled this very hard drive out of a barely two year old system after it died and I've been working to get an employee's critical files off of it for the last few days. After reading the other reviews, I have to agree- this drive is a death camp for your electronic media. If you absolutely positively want to buy this thing, go right ahead, but don't say you haven't been warned."
3,This is not a science book.,"Peter Ward writes of gorgons, the Permian extinction, and life as a paleontologist.It is an interesting read, and there is a lot in here that's worth your time and money. I found some bits of it fascinating (especially his accounts of what it's like in the field). My problem was that I was expecting a book about gorgons. About what science knows (or hypothesizes) about the gorgon. In fact, most of the book doesn't mention the gorgon at all. And only a little is used to explain different ideas regarding the Permian extinction (with very little evidence being offered for Ward's views).If you're looking to learn more about the gorgon - this isn't the books for you. If you're looking to learn more about the Permian extinction, this isn't the book for you.If you're looking for an entertaining read about the process of field paleontology, about the experiences of doing work in a foreign country, then you should pick this up."
4,Nice and easy reading,"Nice account of the hunt for fossils in the Karoo desert in south africa in the search of an explanation for the Permian/Triassic extinction. Combining down to earth paleontology, some explanations on the Permian/Triassic extinction, a description of the political transition in south Africa and a humble account of personal experience as a paleontolog the books makes an easy and nice reading."
1,Where's the beef?,"A book that consists of stories, trials, and tribulations of paleontologists. OK, I can deal with that. But where's the science? Where's the beef? Ward makes claims but there's little to back them up. I thought I might have been missing something until two friends (one a paleontologist himself having actually worked with world fameous Jack Horner) politely claimed 'no comment' about the contents in this book. You would be better off looking up books and articles from 99.99% of the other paleontologists on this planet who smile and wink, then say nothing, when confronted with ""these Gorgons""! Sadly, this is not a book about science. But... draw your own conclusions."
2,Disappointed,I anticipated that this book would be a lengthy discussion of evidence proving the author's theory instead I experienced a long and not too interesting travelogue until page 224 when in five pages 'proof' of the theory was offered. No supporting data was offered. Very disappointing
5,"""NEW"" edition from Beauty and the Book- NAKED CAME I","Great biography of the sculptor, Rodin. Reads like a novel, NOT A TEXT!Beauty and the Book delivered this out-of-print edition in record time. The book looks brand new."
3,Naked Came I,"Hi!This was my first experience purchasing on Amazon.I live in Australia.I was surprised to hear that the book would take 2 months to reach me, how ever Ireceived it in about 10 days. The book was 49 cents US but freight was about $15 US.The hard cover was a surprise as I was replacing a friends book that I had lost. Itwas a great story about The life of Rodin called ""Naked Came I"", that I then finished reading.It would be helpful if there was a cheaper option re freight but it was a userfriendly experience.Thanks"
1,This was not at all what I expected.,"The passages were nice. However, I never expected such a tiny book. I was expecting something along the lines of interactive book. This is simply a tiny book with sweet passages in it. This would make an excellant stocking stuffer!"
3,Good green tea but skimpy on the bergamot flavor,"The green tea itself is of good flavor and quality. However, if I just wanted green tea, that is what I would have purchased. For my taste buds, this green tea only has a ""hint"" of the bergamot flavor. This company's jasmine green tea has the right amount of jasmine flavor and I love it. I'd like to taste a little more bergamot flavor in their earl grey green tea."
5,High Sierra Mesa (Graphite/Ash/Blk),"This is a great pack for long hikes. It has good sized storage space for cell, keys and such. The water bottles hold more water than you'll need in a day, ever."
2,2 little 2 late,My only problem with this pack ordered from this site is the original water bottles are (2) 1000 ml GE Lexan type.They are replaced with (2)smaller 500 ml bottles which do not fit the bottle pouches or bungee holders.You will need to rig a better holder for the smaller bottles untill you purchase the 1000ml ones.The High Sierra Mesa is made to hold (2) 1000ml Bottles.Amazon sells the original bottles for just over $5.00 each.The smaller bottles are made to fit High Sierra's Talus Lumbar pack.
3,Good but not for small dogs,"The product in itself is great, just like all the Dingos but I have two Shih Tzus and these are way too big and clumsy for them.."
3,Cute!,My daughter loves it! Of course she loves everything with Tinker Bell on it. It's a great backpack except the wings on Tinker Bell are coming out of the stitching and she hasn't even had it for one year!
3,About Song of the Lark,"The book Song of the Lark by Willa Cather is a story about a normal country girl, Thea Kronberg, who has magnificent talents in singing. In the book, Cather describes how Thea went a long way from Moonstone to Chicago to Germany to pursue her dream of becoming a famous opera singer. Most of the other characters in the book all helped Thea at some point along the way. Cather particularly described how each character affected Thea in his own way and how Thea had changed as she pursued her dream.This book is a rather slow paced one, with large amounts of detailed information. There are many descriptions of nature, which could be somewhat boring to some readers. Otherwise, it is a well written book with many interesting characters."
5,the song of the lark...written by the lark,"made me cry...and I dont cry. full of her love of the land, and her annoyance with the men who farm it."
2,disappointing novel compared to the memorable my antonia,"i usually love cather's work (o pioneers & my antonia), but what a disappointment & waste of my weekend. thea, fred and dr. archie somehow lacked the spark that makes characters memorable. the scenes, dialogue & setting of moonstone didn't strike true."
2,Hideously dull,"An intensely dry, laborious study of an emerging 'artist' which culminates in one of the most hackneyed, melodramatic endings I have ever read. Try something more to the point, like 'A Lost Lady'. Pass on this one."
4,for the experienced cather reader,"The Song of the Lark is a beautifully crafted novel with quite stunning visual and emotional imagery. Cather tells the poignant story of Thea Kronborg, a musically gifted girl. Thea struggles with her quaint, unartistic upbringing and tries to become her own woman. This novel is not one of Cather's easier books to read. If you have not read her before, or have read a little of her, I would suggest reading O Pioneers! or My Antonia. Both are wonderful,lyric novels. The Song of the Lark is one to read after these."
2,Started about 3.5 but got worse,I did not enjoy this book. Insights from author seemed random and disconnected from plot. Heroine became less and less likable. Epilogue redeemed it from a disappointing 1 star.
4,This is not the standard version!,"I bought this book to replace my old copy which I had read so much it fell apart. (Obviously, I love the book and recommend it highly.) However, I was surprised to find that this edition had no copyright notice and no publisher information. What's more, there were sentences in this version that were not in my original copy. It seems like this was an earlier, unedited version. In a way it was cool, because there was more information about the character and the story, though the lack of editing made the writing less strong. But I can't figure out exactly what goes. The only information about the book is that it was printed in the US. Can anyone shed light on this?"
3,Somewhat Disappointing This Time.,"I love O Pioneers and My Antonia. What happened here? Willa Cather is a wonderful storyteller with so much vitality and so many interesting people in wonderfully pictorial settings. This time, the story, herione, and supporting characters fail to win one over, and the only interesting thing about the book is being able to understand Thea's frustration with less-than-talented people being lauded at a craft she cares more about than breathing and is far more superior at. I'm pretty disappointed on this outing, but two out of three is good, so I'll be back for more Willa. So far, she is my idea of a consummate author."
3,A very unique novel,"Willa Cather's book is a very unique one that sends the reader on a journey with Thea Kronborg's as she gains understanding of herself and strives towards achieving a dream. However, this book is not structured in the usual way where the reader is able to share the thoughts of the main character. Instead, it is set up so that the reader remains on the sidelines as a spectator of Thea's life, never quite becoming a part of it. Thea becomes familiar to the reader only through the observations and thoughts of those close to her. A reader should not go into this book expecting the usual plot developments and ability to see the story through the main character's eyes. Even so, this book provides a wonderfully unique account of many lessons in life and the nature of art."
5,Very easy to read,This is an excellent book on e-commerce and databases. However it is somewhat outdated as the book was presumably written during the dotcom boom. Nevertheless many of the ideas are still very useful. I would suggest that the author updates this book to reflect the recent developments.
3,Bride and Groom,"I just finished Bride and Groom. This was the first Holly Winter mystery I have read in a while, as I became disappointed in the long rambling paragraphs and uninteresting story lines of her later mysteries. However I LOVE dogs and wanted to try them again. B&G was much better than many of her latter books. Still a lot of rambling by Holly, but not as bad. The introduction of a new puppy, Sammy, brought lots of smiles. And the wedding story line was very fast-paced. Many of my old ""favorite"" characters were back and involved-- Rita, Kevin, Steve... even the dog club trainers got named! The actual mystery? Eh, so-so. It was disappointing in the end and the actual killing didn't make sense. Many of the characters were VERY flat and almost caricatures (Ceci and Althea, for instance--ESPECIALLY Ceci!!). This led to lots of eye-rolling as I read! But in general, a good book, and better than most of Conant's latter Dog mysteries. A solid ""B"" from me. :o)"
2,A little less detail PLEASE!!,"This was a cute book, but enough with the detailed descriptions! It was as if the author couldn't come up with enough words to fill her contract, so had to fill in with exhaustive lists of every food item Holly had for dinner, including how it was prepared. I found myself skipping over entire paragraphs of stuff because it added absolutely nothing to the story. In one part there was like a page and a half of her making SALAD for dinner! And reporting on EVERY.SINGLE.TIME she checked her e-mail? Give it a rest! I get that she checks her e-mail frequently!Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book. I managed to get through it to the extremly predictable ending by sheer stubborn will, but I won't be looking for this author's books again."
2,Am I Still Awake?,I devoured all of this writer's books when I first discovered them and it had been quite some time since then when I bought this book. I'm a real sucker for a book with dogs so I dove right in only to become disappointed all too quickly. I didn't remember all the rambling. It is rampant! At times it was almost like reading a text book for all the 'skimming' that I did. I can't say it was a waste of time but some more editing would be appreciated.
3,Do not consider unless you have AirStation router,"This product will only work with other Buffalo Technology AirStation products. So, if you are trying to boost a signal for a Linksys router, etc. then look ELSEWHERE. I bought this to attach to my D-Link wireless router and ended up having to return it.Comments from a friend of mine indicate that this is a great product and does in fact provide increase signal strength. Just don't buy it unless you've got AirStation router!"
3,A nice companion piece to Page's biography.,"If I wanted to understand Juan Peron, this book would not work. However, if you read it in correlation with Page's biography, you get the true picture of Juan Peron. This book has a lot of pictures of the various figures affecting Juan Person's life, and Page's biography is short on pictures. This book more than made up for this absence. It is also a short read, so anybody with the wherewithal to go through Page's biography, would read this in two hours.This is an OK read about Juan Peron. The pictures are great and illustrate the various struggles of Peron's life."
3,Not what was pictured,I contacted the seller because I received two 10 packs of blue and white patterned blankets. Not was what pictured.
5,Huxley and Orwell would be pleased,"Compagnon du Soleil by Monique Corriveau is simply the best anticipation Sci-Fi novel that I have ever read. I have read Brave New World and 1984, and I have read many other anticipations, but never did a book transported me like this one. This is a trilogy that needs to make its mark in other languages, since its only version is in French. But I know someone is working on it. Keep hoping!"
5,"Tool, small crescent",This is a handy and dependable tool to have in the tool box. Very well made and is great in small places. Very well made.
4,"great product, works well","Great product, works well, i hope it was a little longer, there was another version available but was more expensive"
5,Great tool,"Best adjustable wrench I've had. Very precise, good size and weight and has etched metric and English markings."
5,Great little wrench,"I like the hand-size of this, the heft, the action on the adjuster. There are little demarcations to help you target the size you're adjusting for... I'd gotten this to keep with my bike but it's a great size to keep in a small tool-kit.Good simple tool."
1,ALL LIES!! THIS WRENCH RUINED MY BIKE!!,"i bought this wrench because of the reviews and because of the stanley name but apparently noone who has reviewed this item has given it a real test. i bought this wrench specifically for changing the tires on my bike because i didn't have any wrenches. i'm 29 year old male and this wrench would not hold tight to anything. it seems good and tight at first but if you need to put some REAL torque on it, it will be completely useless. this being the case, this wrench is only good for light use. this is sad because i wasted my money paying for the stanley name when i could've reached the same result with a $3 generic cheapie from big lots. please heed my warning and go buy a craftsman."
2,poor quality,"From the photo, one might guess this would be a precise adjustable wrench. The movable part is not machined to a good tolerance and wobbles considerably so when set to an exact size, the adjustable part moves somewhat....my guess is cheap Chinese quality. I wont but Stanley tools anymore. it would be helpful if Amazon would publish the country of manufacture"
2,"""Extra wide jaw capacity"" is a lie","The product claims to have ""extra wide jaw capacity"" which made me think it would be slightly larger than my existing wrench and would fit the fitting I need to get it on. But the max jaw width wasn't really wide at all - it's exactly the same as my current standard wrench. The product description doesn't even say what size it opens to. This is not an extra wide adjustable wrench."
3,Ok quality for price,"Works for what you need it for. It has the size markings on the side of it, which is nice when you try to figure out what size real wrench you need.However, the sliding jaw piece itself is kind of sloppy in the guide and does on occasion get stuck or make you put your finger on the sliding jaw to keep it open when you readjust it on the bolt head.I bought 5 of these for me and my co workers. We all find the same thing with the jaws."
3,Average quality.,"This was purchased to replace a craftsman professional 6"" that broke. Unfortunately, that model is no longer available. It had a nice heavy duty handle and feel to it. This by comparison is not near the quality. The wheel is very loose and the handle is too thick to get a tight hold on in small corners. This size is ideal for plumbing jobs. It is very hard to find wide-mouth adjustable 6"" wrenches anymore, so I had to take what I could get."
1,Avoid This Company,"I bought this player as a gift for my son, who is crazy for LPs. The first use demonstrated a slow and uneven play speed. After about 10 minutes, the turntable ground to a halt. We can hear the motor straining, but nothing is happening. The company forces the customer to pay shipping, even when the product is under warranty. Amazon needs to stop using this supplier. The Crosley company is well below their standards."
5,I love my crosley!,"Crosley CR83 is a wonderful, beautiful, and great sounding record player/cd player/etc. I love listening to my records on it or playing my favorite CD's. I am definintely happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone who is seeking a quality piece without the large price tag. Also the shipping was fast, I recieved my crosley a week earlier than expected."
5,Satisfied with this product.,"I ordered this product for my husband to play all our old records on. I read some of the reviews on it and was almost afraid to order it. It came on the day it was supposed to. I immedietly tried it out, and was so pleased with it The sound is very good and the records drop down and the Arm starts playing them like its supposed to. I'm sure we will enjoy this Player for a good long while. Thank you. I would encourage others wanting a small record player to invest in this Item."
3,Prima Madden 2005,"It`s ok, but where are the team specific playbooks as in years past? This is the main reason I purchased thisguide."
2,I officially have a headache.....,"I ordered Alejandro Fernandez's Album after listening to him sings ""Hay Más"" with Mario Frangoulis. In his defense, Alejandro sounded good and showed some potential.It's not that I regret paying for this album; I'll gladly put this mistake behind me and very happily not listen to it again. However, I think the guy deserves another chance; I hope in the future he can discover words and music put together by some divine artists, or else he will end up as a male model soon.I feel generous today; I'm giving the album one star for the cover which features nice poses, of a well muscled Alejandro, an extra star for the nice picture with the expensive shirt and tie."
5,Alejandro Fernandez simply the best!,"This C.D. was a gift from my mother on my birthday, She knows that I am deeply in love with him. Out of all other gifts I love and treasure this c.d. Alejandro, is such a great singer. I truly wish all the best for him and a very long lasting career such as his fathers."
5,VUELVE ALEJANDRO CON OTRO EXITOSO ALBUM,"ALEJANDRO FERNANDEZ ES SIN DUDA UNO DE NUESTROS ORGULLOS LATINOS EN LA MUSICA MUNDIALMENTE..ESTE ALBUM CONTIENE 10 BELLOS TEMAS,QUE IDENTIFICAN A ESTA TREMENDA VOZ UNICA AL ESTILO DE A.FERNANDEZ..LAS MEJORES CANCIONES SON...YO NACI PARA AMARTE--NO SE OLVIDAR--SI TU SUPIERAS--VOLVERAS Y EL BELLO DUO CON LA SUPER-TALENTOSA(GLORIA ESTEFAN)DEFINITIVAMENTE QUE ESTE CHICO NO NECESITA INTRODUCCION EN LA MUSICA..ES UNO DE LOS MEJORES CANTANTES DE LA MUSICA LATINA..TE RECOMIENDO TAMBIEN EL CD ""TROZOS DE MI ALMA"" DE MARCO ANTONIO SOLIS.."
3,It's not that great.,This cd is not so-so. Alejandro has good powerful voice but in my opinion his pop stuff is not interesting. I love his previous recordings. I find only 3 songs interesting on this cd. The rest are simply boring.
2,Not the Mastering Standard that I am used to,"I have 3 other Mastering books and they are all great. This one is not in that category. Mastering C#, Mastering VB.NET and Mastering Cool Fusion 5.0 are all very good books. This author seems like a real C#/ASP.NET Guru but has no ability to convey that knowledge in a clear concise way. It seems to me like everything is just dumped on the pages instead of being built up step by step. This book might be good if you are already very good at ASP.NET and want to gleam some more insight into some of the deeper workings of ASP.NET, but definitely NOT as a beginner/intermediate book. I consider ASP.NET Unleashed a masterpiece compared to this book. After chapter 6, I just gave up and am going to purchase another ASP.NET C# book to meet my needs."
1,Terrible,"Color is off, flavor is off, and worst of all when you pop a few in your mouth, they soon all stick together. I spit out the first mouthful and threw the rest of the five pounds away."
3,Brilliant in parts,"The author has a gift with words and at times paints a beautiful epic of the evolution of our universe. But I found the quantitative aspects of the book not as entertaining, or convincing. For instance, he has an interesting theory that energy density can serve as a proxy for complexity, but then does things like calculating the energy density of a brain outside of a body or the specific components of the earth's biogeochemical cycles outside of a planetary total. This just doesn't make sense to me - you can't pick and chose components of wholes that have the right quantitative values to support your pet theory. There were other issues as well, like the idea of a drive to complexification in the universe acting as a sort of causal force. This was never stated, but implied. In any event, this is a book worth reading, I just found it quite uneven."
3,"Phil,Phil,Phil..","First off let me say that I have been along follower of Phil Collins as well as Genesis. When I heard that Phil was putting another recording out I was very pleased! I picked-up the new release by Phil Collins titled ""TESTIFY"" and was so very let down! If you will notice: some of the members that he has been with were not listed on this recording. This is not the Phil Collins that I was accustomed too at all. Yea, you can hear his voice on the recording ok, but almost every song on the recording sounds like its the samething (alittle more commercial at times though)! I don't understand some of the reviews here that say that this is a ""Good"" recording and how about the one that says: Welcome Back Phil ! Come on! This is not the way he truely sounds too me at all---I think that he just made a recording too be commercial and not pleasing too many of his fans!..."
4,why are some people griping??!!!,"I read the reviews for this album and actually delayed getting it cos of those,but as a life-long PC/Genesis fan,I couldn`t stay away for long.I listened to it and it was great.It shows both growth and different concepts.Any one hoping to hear the 'old' Phil of the 80`s is really wanting to hear Phil`s signature style(which is not lacking in this album)but he is taking his music in a whole new,happier direction show casing his growth.The whole album is satisfying and Phil really came through for those of us who rely on his music in different phases of our lives.I hope he keeps making albums and not let critics stop him from doing what he does best cos there are people who do appreciate him."
2,A little disappointed!,"I am a very big fan of Phil and usually LOVE all his music but I have to say I was a little disappointed with ""Testify."" For me, there was no flow on the record. ""Can't Stop Loving You"" is great and I wish there were more songs like that on the disc. A few of the ballads are nice but there are no songs with the quality and staying power of a ""One More Night"" or a ""Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart Away"". I just bought it so maybe after giving it a few more listens, the songs will start to grow on me. I hope so!"
2,Underwhelming,"I have been a fan of Collins' for more than 20 years, and I was not exactly impressed with ""Testify"". It's only okay, and it seems like a long lullabye. Not crazy about the production.....Phil's voice seemed buried by all the synthetic music. I have to say that my favorite song on there is one that Phil didn't even write...""Can't Stop Loving You"". I bought a Norah Jones CD at the same time and after having listened to both, I quickly put ""Testify"" aside and enjoyed my Norah Jones CD. I've tried to let ""Testify"" grow on me, but it just isn't happening. Too bad, too, because I really wanted to love this CD. Oh well. Maybe his next effort will be better."
3,I'd give it 3.5 stars..,"Quite good, typical Phil Collins. Amazingly different music for each song. So you never get bored listening to it. And ofcourse, the amazing vocals of one of the greatest singers of our time.Only complaint- he could have been a little more hard rocking, as opposed to so many poppish songs.But still, no regrets. Good job, Phil."
5,Happy birthday Phil!,"Phil Collins newest release ""Testify"" beats out his previous effort ""Dance Into The Light"" which I thought was very weak by his standards. While that album has a few good tracks on it, the whole album felt rather dry in my opinion and went nowhere.""Testify"" on the other hand is a grand improvement over that album and returns to the glory dyas of ""Both Sides"" and ""But Seriously"" because it has a lot of the sounds that were on those two albums.My favorite songs are the cover version of ""Can't Stop Loving You"", ""Come With Me"", ""Wake Up Call"" and the title track. The title track in my opinion is the very best song on this entire album with very edgy production that I haven't heard in years.Ignore these negative reviews and get this album. Phil hasn't sounded this good in a long time."
4,This album goes to court!,"Here is Phil Collins' first all-original album since 1996's DANCE INTO THE LIGHT. One of the songs contains music from Brahms Lullaby. This album has a few dance songs. Genesis' former drummer/lead vocalist has made many solo hits since 1981. This is Phil's seventh all-original album. The others are FACE VALUE,HELLO I MUST BE GOING,NO JACKET REQUIRED,BUT SERIOUSLY,BOTH SIDES and DANCE INTO THE LIGHT. This album ""goes to court"" since it is entitled TESTIFY. Suitable for all music fans."
3,"Better Than DITL, but needs more...","I am a big-time long-time PC fan, both with and without Genesis. I too was a bit disappointed with the ""mid-tempo adult-contemporary radio-friendly pop""(to quote kblam, hope that's ok). I find the more I listen to it, the more I like it, but only when I'm in the mood for ""pleasant backround music"". Since I totally agree with kblam about Testify, based on her/his review, I will go out and get PG's Up!"
2,boring and uninspired,"The first song 'wake up call' is great. Memorable synth lines, excellent backing vocals. But once you get onto track 2, the chorus is so boring and sounds like a melody that has been churned out hundreds of times before. The lyrics are generally execrable and all the songs are all so similar, I can remember none of them. Mid tempo balladry, with a couple of slightly faster ones. 'You touch my heart' has some nice nylon guitar parts and some nice synths. So that makes the opening and last tracks that should have been released as a single. Ditch most of the rest. Boring and repetitive."
3,He could have done better,"It's not bad, but it's not one of his best either. Phil seems to have just taken it easy on this one - the drums, bass and synthesizers are pretty much the same throughout the album, just sped up or slowed down. Not much in the way of guitars or horns, either. It's like listening to 12 of the slower songs from Dance Into The Light.I'm a bit disappointed after waiting all this time. It says he took two years to put this album together. You would have hoped or thought there was more range on it."
2,This album is not worth your time,"I do not own this album but i listened to all of the tracks. The only good song on here is ""can't stop loving you"" The song is very upbeat, has a catchy tune and is one of those songs you won't mind playing over and over again. However the other songs on this album are very slow, So slow that it would make you fall asleep to it. It's kind of like Elevator music. Not only that, it's annoying. If you really like the hit ""can't stop loving you"" i suggest you download the mp3. Do not buy this album it is a waste of money and you will most definitely be dissapointed."
1,"""Faceless"" music","Contrary to Phil's first solo debut ""Face Value"", ""Testify"" is completely ""Faceless"" music! Too sweet, very boring and monotone.Where is unique sound of Genesis, ecstasy and rhythm of the songs? I think since Phil officially left the Genesis, each album he produced, shows his slow degeneration, and the ""Testify"" is ""testified that""! This CD is waste of the money."
1,Boring!!!!!!!,what happened to Phil Collins? the Guy use too have a Groove or two on His Albums but nowadays He is Easy-Listening beyond easy listening.this album seems standard by the numbers.stick too His 80's stuff.I can't get with the Disney Phil Collins vibe.
3,"3 Stars for the music, NO stars for copy protection!","As far as the music goes it's Phil Collins lite, with none of the excitement of his earlier work, but others have put this far better then I can. However, what hasn't been mentioned as far as I can see, is that this CD is copy protected. This means it won't play in my computer, which is where I listen to most of my CDs. This has to be the most pointless bit of new technology ever. Every single one of these tracks was available in MP3 format on the internet within one week of release of the album. Obviously copy protection doesn't work, it just annoys those people who go out and buy the album. What's the point of that?. It's simply stupid and the record companies should realise that they are alienating the consumer."
3,3 of 5,"This release marks a steady degression in the quality of Phil Collins albums. Dance Into The Light, while musically moving, isn't on the level of Both Sides. Testify; the title track of which suggests a romantic, not religious, undertone; is even lower on the scale.You won't knowe that by listening to the first song. Wake-Up Call comes with an inspirational message and bouncy bass-line. But it's one of only about two good songs on an album of mostly spiritless sleepers. It seems Phil Collins has simply lost his knack for melody.marcellee.com"
2,Sorry to Phil in Advance,"C'mon...does anyone remember when Phil used to be a drummer? What happened??? Rather than pick this apart song by song, let's just say he needs to spend less time in the studio. These songs are good - there is just too much electronic stuff on them - the melodies just get buried.Phil - if you read this... you can call me. I will help in any way I can. My first recommendation is to throw out every drum machine you own. My second is to bring back musicians to play the other instruments - HAVE FUN AT YOUR CRAFT. This cd sounds like you are not having a good time."
3,Not much better than his last (dance into the light),"before this album was released critics were giving it fairly good reviews. Phil did get back to the good drumming here and the CD had moments including the leo sayer cover can't stop loving you and least you can do. Wakeup call was alright but sounded alot like the both sides album. Phil's voice is going too. In the last couple years he has had heaing loss and vocal cord problems. He's 54 now... You can't blame him for sucking now. he did so many wonderful things and he can't be on top forever. I'm just wondering where the musician went. Anything Phil has done since 1993(post we can't dance with genesis - 1991-1992 / both sides) has been mediocre. Like I said though, there were moments on this one and you can, at times, here old phil collins and genesis patterns here."
1,Do not accept mediocrity,"Here's another mediocre CD by Phil Collins. I was hoping he would challenge himself and create interesting music again but it sounds like a continuation of the same mundane, mid-life crisis he's been having for the last ten years.The divide between former bandmate Peter Gabriel is greater than ever. Whereas Peter's excellent album 'Up' (released the same year) is an exploration of sonic landscapes and psychological, personal and cultural phenomena using a multitude of disparate musicians from around the globe, Phil Collins' music is self-centered but not self-revealing.In the end, it turns out that Phil Collins couldn't maintain the creativity exhibited on Face Value and Hello, I'm Must Be Going! His music will be forgotten like much of the other mediocre music of the '80s and '90s.[DW]"
5,"amazing, uplifting, wild and meditative","this is so amazing... i cant describe it in a way... the songs r very tuneful... i might agree with many that the lyrics seem not so much of phil, except the case of wake up call, swing low thru my eyes and dont get me started... but it goes so wellll... i dont care whether he used computers or not... this is phil collins with an amazing tone of voice and unbeatable melodies... the very best through his career ..."
1,another piece of garbage!,"Phil Collins has not released anything interesting since ""But Seriously"". His songs sound more and more like easy listening...with every cd he puts out. He has always been one of the best drummers and vocalists in rock, but he is steadily going downhill as far as creativity is concerned and this is sleepy time music. He turned genesis into a pop band and ruined them and now he is just putting out mindless boring stuff! His next one i think i will just pass by!"
1,Terrible doll for potty training - doesn't wet,"Despite the description as being a ""drink-and-wet doll"", this doll doesn't actually drink water or wet! It's useless for potty training. Very misleading."
3,Not for Novices,"If you are new to the study of logic, this book is not what you are seeking. The text does not flow well (the result of having four co-authors, perhaps?), the typesetting is distracting, and the content is not suited to beginners. The book may be better suited to someone seeking to brush up on the principles of logic after a long period has passed since formal studies of the subject."
3,Eh...,"I'm not feeling it. This didn't help put all of the peices together for me. Its not particularly bad, just not my style. May be good for some people. I prefer the bulletproof book & the zeldman book on the same subject much more."
3,An explanation of the website,"A good book that works to explain the website and some of the designs. It will not show you how to build CSS driven websites like this or give you a tutorial, but will rather show you the possibilities of what can be done and give you some explanation on how they can be done. Interesting, but looking at the website is almost as valuable."
2,it really is disappointing,"So, i know a little about CSS, i want to get better, i get this book.Unlike what i expected, this book is more about design than about CSS. You'll find a few pieces of valuable information on CSS, but i know they're holding back a lot of knowledge here. It could go much deeper, and i think it should. Everytime it starts getting interesting it says: to find out more about this please visit the website at http://www.soando...I don't want to read all this on screen. I hate reading on screen. That's why i got this book after all. And i don't want to have to turn on the computer everytime i want to know more.Now, books on design in general are a good thing too. But unfortunately i feel that this book doesn't do a good job here."
3,Good but not great,"[...] I already knew this would be a design book and not a CSS guide.The problem is that both the book and the site are misleading. These are essentially home pages by graphic designers. However as a practical matter, none of these designs would work site-wide - rather the point of a style sheet, after all. There's simply not enough screen 'real estate' to accommodate content in subsequent pages. In addition, the designs are such that tooling them to 'brand' across sub-pages sitewide would be very difficult, and the book provides no examples, guidelines, or suggestions for doing so.For inspiration, to see what you can do with color and layout, and for finding your own unique vision, this book may be useful. For designing sites of more than one page, however, this book falls short."
4,CSS Zen Garden and e-Commerce Implications,"CSS Zen Garden, Eric Meyers and Jeffry Zeldman have long been at the forefront of CSS Design and their work has been the inspiration for countless applications, mostly in the niche of blogs and content sites. How their CSS table-less design methods affect e-Commerce is yet to be determined, but the techniques for layout is surprisingly well suited for search engine optimization.New eCommerce applications from Zen Cart (Open Source) to our own CSSCommerce (commercial) have been equally inspired by the compliant coding promoted by this book.CSS Zen Garden is richly beautiful in its own right and one can immediatly see the advantage of using the techniques found here as the cornerstone of high-end web site design. But, as it applies to e-Commerce, the information is strangely lacking... more needs to be written.Forms, columns and rows of products, the mainstays of eCommerce are untouched by this book."
2,Dissapointing Purchase,"At the bookstore, I was seduced by the graphics and the concept of the book. The world really needs a book like this. The concept of incorporating css and graphic design as one creature is really pertinant.However, the book was watered down and poorly organized. It takes designs from the website and discusses parts of them. I found this piecemeal approach really difficult to understand. A little code here, a little design there but never enough to provide a solid context.It also tried to cover too much ground, and as a result it didn't go into enough depth to be of any use.This was a pretty expensive book (at the book store it was about $40), and I found it almost a complete waste of money. Buy something better, such as Styln' With CSS."
4,"Great book, but not for beginners","I was very happy with the contents of this book, but it isn't intended for beginners. Much of the content of the book is also available from the ZenGarden website."
3,Design not CSS,This book is mostly about design principles and much less about CSS. Useful information but not the hard hitting CSS principles I would have expected.
2,"great designed book, but not an advanced css book!!!","I'm so sad, this writers brought all their friends to praise them and mark them 5 stars, but it worth less then 2i consider myself as an advanced css builder who wants to progress in the field of cssi wanted to learn about new techniques, new hacks and all about layouts and id'si was disappointed!you know those books that the writer just pure his text into his notepad and expand the size of the pages by lots of unnecessary information? with dozens of pictures and lot of repeated words ? here we have these casei spent 25$ more then i needed to spent, they told me that this book is for advanced users, but its only for how-to-decorate-a-book wish to become artistsi gave this book 2 stars just because it covers areas that novice will need to know, and it will guide me in the future if ill need to design a book by myselfhoped i helped one poor soul :)"
1,"not a good book, but maybe a good Coffee table book","THe table of Contents has subheadings of this kind:Revolutions!No Frontiers!Coastal BreezeOcean Apart... YOu cannot find your way with such labelling. The authors aspire to be poets when they are supposed to be guides, pedagogues, tutors to help you out with learning CSS and learning how to design pages.The index does not have much in term of CSS keywords.If you are not a creative person, buy this book and educate your eye. If you are a creative person this book won't help you and you are going to waste a lot of time reading blabblabla.Though there is valuable information inside, but it is impossible to access/find it very easily. The authors are very knowledgeable. That is too bad that they know how to design web sites but don't know how to convey information in a book form."
2,The same information is available on the web,"The basis behind this book is excellent. It takes CSS to another level.However, you can find all of the information that is here in print on the Internet or specifically on the Zen Garden website itself.Nothing new here."
3,"Great Illustrations, but left me a little puzzled","I bought this book years ago wanting to learn CSS before it became popular. I have always loved the artwork produced on csszengarden's web site. I figured that the book would teach me css. I was somewhat wrong. The book covers techniques the page developers used to create some of the artwork, but never really explains what the different settings mean. The book also seemed to jump around and did not flow with any explanation. I ended up learning CSS from the web. Even now that I know CSS extensively, I have gone back and read this book again and can really see how it jumps around and does not explain the techniques very well. I do still keep the book in my toolbox for some reference, but hardly ever look at it anymore."
4,Great book,"Haven't read the entire book yet, but so far it's the best book on css and webdesign i've read. All other books just mention the applications functions and ways to code it but they never go into design, this book does just that. Plus great designs are examples in every chapter."
5,Great book!,I very much liked how the book skipped the basics of CSS and went into how it was used to affect the design of the example pages. It became a bit dry at about the halfway point for me but still worthy of a 5-star rating.
2,Boring book,"I am a big fan of the website which is a big source of inspiration, and was very happy when I found out that there was a book.And now... Disappointment.First of all, the cover is very ugly, and the book's format is a bit clunky.The designs they have chosen are nothing special, kind of boring designs. Why did they choose these designs, when there are much more interesting designs on the site?And the book also feels a bit out-of-date. Hey, they even talk about Netscape!Nope, spend your money on some other book. Read the CSS on the website!"
2,"more about design, not about css","Bought the book, looked good and was hoping to find more information about CSS. The book is mostly about design. It has beautifull pictures of different designs for one website. If you're looking for inspiration on how to design your site, this book could help you. If you're looking how to use CSS, buy another book.The book doesn't clearly show you how to make the sites, the lessons of this book are not useless but could be told in a book of 30 pages instead of 296.If you really want to know how to use CSS buy Eric Meyer's books."
2,where is the css?,"Like the review below, this book spends most of it's time talking about design, and really, it reads just like an art history book 101 ... So if you like reading art history books, then great! The examples that they choose are great, but they don't go into detail about how the artists actually created the site using CSS. This book, might inspire you, but I don't think it help you design sites like the ones in this book using CSS, because there is just too much fluff and not enough content. I recommend you save your money, and instead, look at the css code on the beautifule csszengarden site. I found that 10 times more useful."
2,Wish I Had Previewed it Better Before Buying...,"It's basically a book that hypes the parent website. I read this book hoping to actually learn HOW to do some of the stuff I'd seen on csszengarden.com. It does go into some detail, but at such a shallow depth you soon realize you would've been better served just checking the source code on the site itself. CSS is a huge topic, and I wouldn't even give this book credit with scratching the tip of the iceberg.I would definetly recommend skimming this at a bookstore before purchasing, I think you'll find it's not quite the book it's made out to be."
3,Case Study NOT How To,"What most of the negative reviewers of this title seem to not realize is that this is not a ""HOW TO"" book. If you want a book to learn CSS, there are plenty of better choices. This is a case study book of one web site, the process from beginning to end. This is a designer's notebook on a project."
5,Exactly as presented,"This product was delivered exactly as requested, very quickly and in good condition. I am very pleased with the quality of the product and the customer service of Amazon."
4,Fantastic,"The Fat Max is by far the best tape measure I have ever used,and I tried just about every one.The only thing that I dont like about it is it dosent hook onto thins very well.I'm a sheetmetal worker and when I try to hook it on duct work it always slips off. What I did is I made a groove on the underside of the end piece and now it works great."
1,Just A Paperweight,"Bought this to try since I usually work alone and could often use a little extra ""reach"" on my tape. While this one does provide a little more than my old Stanley Powerlocks, that feature is worthless because of all the effort required to get the lock to engage. By the time I get it locked I've shaken the tape so much that I might as well have been carrying a little pocket tape. I had hoped that after using it awhile that the lock would ""break in"" and become usable, but just the opposite happend - adding a little dirt made it almost impossible to lock at all. Also noticed that because of the large arc in the blade that the end tab needs to be longer; it doesn't want to stay hooked as well as my other tapes. Add in the overall bulk of the case and this is possibly the worst tape I've ever owned."
1,Blade lock is a deal breaker,The horizontal stand-out is impressive but the blade lock that requires two hands to engage is a deal breaker. Also due to the wide blade the tape will not extend far when the numbered side is facing you with out the tape flopping to the ground.
2,2 hands to lock it open,"Must be just mine as I haven't see another review that mentions this. The thumb locking button is a real pain to push to get the tape measure to lock in place. I have a tough time doing it with 1 thumb.I never thought of this before, maybe my expectation for this well known tape measure had my hopes up, but I'd love it if this tape measure didn't buckle when holding it sideways. You can only read the tape if you are holding it below head level. Sometimes you have to take a reading overhead and need to hold the tape sideways so you can read it. Does anyone make a tape measure that is sturdy somewhat when it's being used sideways?"
1,Bad purchase,"I'm normally a big Stanley fan. But, this tape got one attempted use by me and I ordered a different one the next day. The lock button either does not work or it is the first time I have been unable to make one work. Either way, obviously not for me. The retracting of the tape is sticky and took two hands to reel in. Very disappointed. May have been simply a lemon on its own, but it is the one I got and for which I am sharing this review, just in case there might be a second lemon of this model out there. Certainly would not recommend ordering this on line. Find one you can try working in person before spending the money."
4,Best tape available,"This is the best tape measure available, in my opinion. I use mine every day, and they seem to last about 6-8 months. The key is to be careful when you're reeling the tape back in... kinks and burs can develope easily if you let it in to fast, take your time and it will extend the life of the tape somewhat."
3,Fat Max Tape - A Mixed Bag,"I bought this tape because I work alone frequently and the reach on it tops everything else. However, for a tape that is 50-60% more expensive you'd think that the locking mechanism would work properly. It takes two thumbs to securely lock the tape open - anything less and the tape slips back into the case. My case is now cracked near the locking lever. I'll continue to use it when I need the reach but my old Stanley Powerlock is in my tool pouch."
1,Shreaded pants pocket.,This is a good tape and I have many of them... at least 10 on hand and have gone though maybe 5 or 6. In the last couple years trying to make life easier while still doing a lot of the work I have let others strap on the tool bags and have just put the tape on my pants pocket.I recomend folks take the pocket clip off and grind the inside so it doesn't cut the threads on your pants pocket. I noticed I've got several pair of expensive work pants and the pocket is just shreaded and many of them have about an inch of pocket missing now.It's like a razor blade on the inside of the pocket clip and a single day of use will completly shread your pants pockets.
4,Perfect rough framers tape,"They're the only tape that I've used in the past few years. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I still have to occasionally replace it (about once a year), but this is under every day use... and very few tools last forever on a jobsite."
4,Great for rough construction,"This tape is vary tough I've dropped it many times, some from 10+ feet. Yeh it's bulky for sure but most of the folks I see using them simply clip them onto what every belt or strap they are wearing. I can't see much improvement on it except maybe more screws to hold the clip and 1/32 marks but really it`s not used often where that kind of accuracy is needed. Bottom line if you need quick, long, unsupported measurements (say finding the center of a ceiling) this tape is worth giving a try. Also I haven't notice the locking mechanism being hard to open or close. I have had it come out of the little slot inside and make it hard to open after a good hard drop thou."
4,It's just another tape measure,I bougt one of these and its a nice heavy duty tape measure. Its good for taking long sideways measurements since it is stiffer than a standard tape. So far it has survived several falls without breaking. I gave it a shot after my last Craftsman broke. I would have to say its built better at a better price. I quit buying Craftsman tape measures after they changed there waranty to exclude blade breakage.
4,Great Tape...get the 16 ft!,"My boss has this tape and I fell in love with it, I also have the Stanley lever lock(see my other reviews) which is ok but these fat max's really can reach farther and with the rubber boot surrounding you can hold it better. Well I picked up the 16ft fat max and Ilike it better because of the smaller size. It fits in my handsbetter and in my toolbelt a lot better as well. My boss recently stole this tape (16 ft.) from me because he likes the smaller size as well. UPDATE: My boss finally bought the 16ft and another coworker of mine did the same. Sadley my tape got to close to the miter saw and was cut in half. I think i willtry the new stanley fat max xl 16ft."
1,One of Stanley's worst tools,"As a general contractor I have been through my share of tape measures of varying models and makes, and I have to say this is one of the worst I've ever used. At only 2 months old the blade wont retract all the way in any more and started to act up soon after it was first put into use. The blade lock is difficult to work. It wont fit into a tape holster without forcing it and then it gets stuck and grabs the tape hook and/or the blade lock. I'm also hearing the same things from others in my line of work. ""Stanley. What happened to the old PowerLock tape? I can't find them anymore, and that's a tape that was worth the money!"""
2,Good Tape...But Breaks Easy,"I'm a finish carpenter and unfortunetely I got addicted to the fat max too, but after going through one tape every 2 months or less I've switched back to the ""Wimpier"" 1"" rule. The problem is that the tape is so ridgid (which is great if your measuring across a room) that it gets nicks in the side of it instead of flexing then when the edge of the tape hits anything the tape starts to rip and after a few more uses the tape breaks. After dropping $25 bucks a tape every couple of months i just can't afford these tapes anymore. They are nice but you have to baby them, even so I still go through them way too fast. I use my tape hundreds of times a day and this one just doesn't stand up to the punishment. The locking mechanisim doesn't work well either, you have to push much harder than most tapes to lock the tape in place."
3,watch you'r fingers,"There's no doubt that the Fat Max tape has the longest possible stand out in the buisness. It is helpful to understand, however, that the tapes width makes it prone to tearing; a problem that, when combined with it's frighteningly rapid recoile mechanism, can seriously damage the digits of the careless operator. In addition, anyone who is accustomed to catching the lip of the tape with the index finger of your tape hand, may be apt to suffer a crush injury trying to arrest the return velocity of this tenacious tool. On the whole I like it very much."
4,seems ok,"Never really thought about getting an expensive tape measure with an 11 foot stand out, but tried it. It does seem firmer and extending the tape, but you have to arch the tape up to prevent the tip from dipping down and this skews the accuracy of the measurement. The tab to press down to hold the tape does not seem to hold and on numerous times it has released prematurely."
5,Works so far,Was familiar with similar item so purchased this one. Haven't used it entirely too much as of yet but still works even as someone has borrowed it once already(things tend to break often in other's hands.)
1,Drop it and 'KABOOOOOM',"I purchased this tape because it looked big and heavy duty. Mine was big and springy, and well, I didn't get too far. I dropped it on concrete from waist-high, and it came apart and unsprung. If anyone needs some spare parts for this one, they are all over my front yard!"
4,When designing home theater.....,"You need a good stiff tape with all the standout a manufacturer can muster. Especially when one is working alone. This Stanley fits the bill nicely for my needs. It could be easier to lock-down; however.A neat little trick to find the center of your room....place one tape on the right speaker, run it to the left wall using the left speaker for support. Place another tape on the left speaker run it to the right wall. Put the two tape blades close together, find the common measurement between the two tapes, use a plumb-bob to mark the floor. ""Well duh"" for some ""Golly gee"" for others."
3,"Good tape, but don't pull too far","Owned this for 5 years and liked it, though in retrospect is was a little heavy for daily use. Finally one day I pulled too far and once you do that the tape won't ever go back in. A serious design flaw if you can cripple a product so easily and fatally. Beware!"
2,No replacement spring available.,"The FatMax has a durable look and feel, but make no mistake, obsolescence is built-in. After a year and a half of occasional use, the spring broke and is not replaceable."
2,Not tough enough(Updated),"I'm with the other 2 star guy . I use mine many times a day . I wear them out fast. If you bend it to read the tape, its nick city, then tape tear, then new tape. I'll be getting the cheaper one myself. UPDATEWhatever problems they had they are fixed I tried all the other tapes (I got a pile)they are not worth the effort. At any rate I kept using my last tape and am still using it, changed the case (old broken tape) because the lock quit working, but still the same blade all this time, and I measure a lot."
2,all hype,"I bought one of these a couple of years ago and the blade recently developed a split and has now become a $20 paperweight, since Stanley does not sell replacement blades. I think the whole FatMax line of tools is just a lot of advertising hype. Its creation was solely for marketing purposes, and had nothing to do with improving existing tools."
2,Who designed this?,"I've been stymied trying to find the width of the Fat Max's body to calculate the total length. I measured it with another tape (irony) at 3 1/4"" but wondered why there wasn't an indication on the housing. Finally, with my arm's-length near eyesight I found a molded legend that's almost covered by the belt clip. Pisspoor product design, but it's a Stanley tradition. Even with reading glasses its hard to read the reflective chrome plated numerals on earlier Stanley tapes I've owned. I wrote a big ""+3 1/4"" on the case with a Sharpie and vow to avoid Stanley products in the future."
3,Great Tape Measure but Pricey,"The FatMax is the sweetest tape measure around, but I don't use it as much as I'd like to because it's too expensive. I often work with contractors/friends/neighbors or have same around. For some reason, tape measures always seem to ""walk"". Measure something, clip it on, it's gone. I started buying the cheapest tape measures I could find, and they still walked (about 5 last year). It's also costly to use because you know it's going to get all gunked up. Unfortunately, I keep my FatMax indoors for use around the house only..."
4,Solid tool,"I bought one of these after my craftsman broke and since they don't replace them for free anymore. I have been very impressed thus far with this tape's performance. It is larger, easier to read, and the tape seems more durable than others I've used. I would highly recommend this measuring tape. I didn't give it 5 stars because the Bostitch tape has the metal tab made to grab onto and hold onto the edge of the wood and this doesn't. Since it's made by the same company, I'm not sure why they don't go the extra mile and add this to their FatMax line since it is an asset to have, at least in my opinion."
3,FatMax,"This tape measure has a very good stand out length. It is fairly durable. I do not like the foot on the end,it will not grip metal surfaces well when measuring long distances. It is also a very heavy and large unit."
4,Very good,I used the piss out of this tape until I dropped it into a creek and the innards stopped working as a result of rust I'm sure. I have since bought a new one just like it. The long stand out really a shows its worth when I'm working alone and don't have anyone to hold the other end. The only complaint is that the tip/hook is kind of sloppy so whenever I'm doing anything that needs really precise measurements I grab a different smaller tape.Experience level in relation to this tool: medium
1,Junk,"Didn't last me 2 weeks. Despite the claims of 11' stiffness, the tape bent around 53"". Multiple bends and twists during the course of a single day causes the metal tape to actually tear. Now it will not retract. This is going back."
4,Chubby and maybe a bit stubby too!,"The last thing I needed was another tape measure, but I'm tired of 1"" tapes flopping and sagging when making long measurementss by myself. This fat guy doesn't sag or flop very often. Just wish that Stanley would make a 30' or 35' version. Then I'd buy another tape that I really didn't need!"
4,Fat Max Tape Measure,"I bought one ot Stanley's ""Fat Max"" tape measures,and now that I've had it for a few months, I can offer the following opinion. Yes, it is the tape to buy for hooking the far end of a board and it will win your tape races, but it is a little bulky and awkward. That's not necessarily a bad thing. I've yet to see a Stanley tape in the recycle bin - you CAN'T hurt them. The best free advise is; if your a framer, they're ideal (in fact a must), if your a cabinetmaker, maybe not."
1,Not cracked up to be what it claims to be,"I have bought the FAT MAX when they first came out, they claim 11' stand out and I never made it past 10 feet. The tape is very heavy and when dropped it breaks open like an egg.The first time it fell was only from 5 feet onto a wooden deck, the lock button broke off. And for [the price] I would expect more from the product. I have bought a new tape called WIDE BOY from SNS Tapes, now this one takes a fall from 20 feet and they hit 10'6"" to 11' everytime. And that is not on the 35 degree angle needed to get the FAT MAX to hit 10Feet. One other thing that makes it better is the WIDE BOY fits in the tape hold on my tool belt. It is also [less expensive] and comes with a utility knife I give this one a five star! So sorry STANLEY your not the best tape out there anymore."
4,Desert Denoument,"As Dante in his DIVINE COMEDY describes the migrations of dead souls, so Minton and his LEOPARD watch over the pilgrimage of a modern man seeking to escape a living hell. This novel, with its dusty road to redemption in Judea, reveals much about life and is unquestionably the product of an accomplished writer.But Minton is not Dante. He occassionally shifts into a more complex literary style; this can be effective, but also it can result in a text too dense and opaque. Nevertheless, this work is well worth the reading. RecommendedFull disclosure: this reviewer has known the author for many years."
3,Not a direct fit,The flange to the manifold needs to be modified. The holes are too close together. A few minutes with a Dremil tool to expand the holes got it to fit properly. Once the manifold end is bolted up the y-pipe flange is a little too high so there is some stress on the pipes once everything is bolted up. Hopefully nothing breaks because of it.
3,"Interesting, but dated","Half of this book is Burgess' essays about _1984,_ with disquistions on Ingsoc, Newspeak and doublethink, among other things. The other half was his tongue-in-cheek portrayal of a future Britain dominated utterly by the Trades Union Councils. I found it utterly dystopian, with echoes of _A Clockwork Orange_, but Labour voters would likely think it was heavenly."
2,dead and unprobable,"i quite enjoyed burgess dissing of the faults and quirks of '1984'.the only fault with 1985 is that it tells a unprobable story in a totally un-living fashion. his misinterpretations of syndicalism and anarchism also disturbs me. a good idea, but poorly executed."
1,Wish I had read the reviews!!,"I purchased this product from Target because it had a $15 gift card promo. I have been through many vacuum cleaners, and thought maybe this one would live up to its name. I wish I had read the reviews here!! This horrible vacuum broke just after 2 months!!! It has stopped working all of a sudden. The suction was terrible as well - even after selecting power 5, it barely sucked all the dirt. I am sick and tired of the vacuums breaking down - is there no good one? I don't want to shell out $500 for a Dyson! I don't even have pets."
1,Not Worth Anything,"I bought this item for mixed use floors: wood and carpet. The vacuum has the suction of an 80 year old smoker. On wood floors, it just scatters dirt. On carpets, it does a little better, but not a lot. Not even the hose by itself works with any efficacy. For example, you could NOT suck up a penny with the vacuum no matter how hard you tried with ANY of its attachments."
4,Works Great for the Price!,"I have wood flooring or tile in most of my house and it works great. On the floor it actually sucks up dirt and dust from a few inches away from the vacume, which I think is pretty neat. I have a more expensive vacume but its heavy and requires bags so its a pain to use. This one you just have to dump and dust the filter out. I've had mine for over a year with no problems. My Stepmom came over to use it recently and loved it so much that she's requested one. I do actually use it on carpet in a couple of rooms and it works pretty good. Overall if your trying to vacume thick carpet, this vacume is not for you but if you have tile, wood, or not thick of carpet this is a great vacume."
2,Not recommended,"I don't recommend this vacuum cleaner! It worked great for the first few times I used it, but quickly stopped picking up things from the carpet completely. If I'm expected to change the filter after every 3 uses, then this is definitely not worth the money!"
5,This is better,"it is an expensive reed, but it is ready to play right away; no sucking, soaking, warming up. the tone is like wood, maybe better. they are durable (unless your 3 year old bites it in which case mine still plays). i have one for all my saxophones. I do find the notes higher than high C hard to hit and I really have to adjust my armbature or however it is spelled. low notes flow with ease."
4,"beautiful, delicate, smaller than expected","very nice quality, high shine and lovely style. I wear them often. Like the post instead of a wire, makes them feel very secure and not like they are pulling on my lobes.I wish they were longer/bigger but it is hard to judge from a picture (or holding a ruler up to one's ear!)"
3,Mill Creek Films are terrible,Any movies distributed by Mill Creek are just terrible quality...the only reason to buy these discs are to increase your library and semi enjoy these old movies!
4,Satisfied,"the DVD came in perfect condition, nice shipping and I was happy with that. I got a little bored watching some of the shows, but that is just because I'm not a hard core western fan. I hadn't really ever seen John Wayne so I wans't like a huge fan that bought the DVD just for that. But if you love John wayne and old old westerns you have a winner! You can tell that the stories are older because of parts in the first couple stories are somewhat bad quality... but that is expected out of that old of movies. I wasn't dissapointed in the product. As I said: if you Love John Wayne or old westerns, I'm sure you will be more than satisfied!"
